  "<p>Jeremy Corbyn was challenged about his position on Brexit and questioned over his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/09/conor-mcginn-holly-lynch-labour-mps-whips-resign-rosie-winterton\">sacking of Rosie Winterton as chief whip</a>, as he faced his party\u2019s MPs for the first time since his re-election as leader.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/09/conor-mcginn-holly-lynch-labour-mps-whips-resign-rosie-winterton\">Two Labour MPs resign as whips after Rosie Winterton sacking</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Labour leader was pressed by colleagues after the party\u2019s shadow secretary of state for exiting the EU, Keir Starmer, appeared to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/oct/09/keir-starmer-calls-for-immigration-to-be-reduced\">set out a different line on immigration</a> policy than the shadow home secretary, Diane Abbott.</p> <p>A spokesman for Corbyn told journalists outside the meeting that Starmer\u2019s call for immigration numbers to be reduced was not at odds with Abbott or Corbyn himself.</p> <p>\u201cJeremy has made clear chasing after impossible targets or caps doesn\u2019t work and inflames divisions,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the case he was making during the referendum campaign was for decisive action against the undercutting of wages and the exploitation of migrant workers. If you take effective action \u2026 you will reduce numbers.\u201d</p> <p>This came after Labour MPs said they were not clear on the party\u2019s position on Brexit in advance of an opposition day debate on Wednesday, with Barry Sheerman asking Corbyn: \u201cWhat\u2019s the plan, Stan?\u201d</p> <p>Corbyn\u2019s response was not satisfactory for some of those present, with one MP heckling: \u201cWhat\u2019s the line? What\u2019s the line?\u201d</p> <p>Emma Reynolds called on the leader to consider taking a more robust position on freedom of movement because of the demands of constituents across the Midlands and the north of England.</p> <p>The MPs also asked their leader about a Guardian/ICM opinion poll, which gives the Conservatives a 17-point lead at the end of the party conference season. The survey places Theresa May\u2019s party on 43% while Labour slips to 26%, with Ukip on 11% and the Lib Dems on 8%.</p> <p>One MP said the meeting felt like \u201cGroundhog Day\u201d and they were not convinced by Corbyn\u2019s call for unity. During a tribute to Winterton, whom he has replaced with Nick Brown in his post-victory reshuffle, the Labour leader was heckled by MP John Spellar who shouted: \u201cWhy did you sack her then?\u201d</p> <p>Another MP, Jess Phillips, challenged the leader for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/10/corbyn-under-fire-speaking-anti-racism-rally-links-swp-socialist-workers-party\">speaking at an anti-racism rally</a> linked to the Socialist Workers party.<br></p> <p>Some MPs were angry after they felt Corbyn questioned whether Russia had been involved in the bombing of a UN aid convoy in Syria that resulted in the deaths of a number of civilians. MPs said Corbyn referred to an attack that was \u201capparently\u201d carried out by the Russians.</p> <p>Angela Smith MP, who asked about the issue, said: \u201cIt is deeply concerning that Jeremy is unwilling to face up to the role that Putin\u2019s Russia is playing in Syria. The recent criminal atrocities committed in Aleppo make the case for an effective international response overwhelming and Labour needs to show moral leadership on what is an intolerable situation.\u201d</p> <p>However, Corbyn\u2019s spokesman denied that he had held back on the issue. \u201cThe evidence is often very murky but he said that the evidence appears to show that Russia was involved in the bombing, if not Russia the Syrian airforce, and all evidence appears to show it was a war crime. </p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s looking at real evidence rather than the rhetoric. He has condemned all atrocities, he has condemned Russia, he opposes all forms of foreign intervention in the conflict.\u201d</p> <p>The spokesman said he had not heard Corbyn use the words \u201capparent\u201d or \u201calleged\u201d in reference to Russia\u2019s bombing. \u201cThere are many, many other atrocities taking place as well.\u201d</p> <p>He added that Corbyn had used the meeting to push for unity, but said MPs were having to adjust to the size of the leader\u2019s second mandate. </p> <p>\u201cThe majority of Labour MPs are looking for ways to work with the leadership. It\u2019s in everybody\u2019s interests. That\u2019s the clear mood at the meeting tonight. There have been a number of stormy meetings and this doesn\u2019t even register on the low level of the Richter scale,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The decision to remove Winterton was taken because of a clear need to reset the relationship with the parliamentary Labour party, he added. \u201cAfter a year, it\u2019s necessary for that to be reset in a way that represents his mandate. It\u2019s time to move to a new one.\u201d</p> <p>Meanwhile, a leading thinktank is preparing to launch an initiative examining what people who voted remain believed about \u201ctaking back control\u201d of their lives.</p> <p><a href=\"http://neweconomics.org/political-leaders-ignore-remain-voters-at-their-peril/?header=Latest\">Research</a> from the New Economics Foundation found that the majority of remain voters felt they were lacking in power, with 62% saying the world is run by \u201cthe few people in power and there is not much the ordinary citizen can do about it\u201d.</p> <p>Just 27% of remain voters agreed with a statement saying, \u201cThe average citizen can have an influence on government decisions\u201d, while 55% specifically identified big business and corporate elites as having \u201ctoo much control over their lives\u201d.</p> <p>At an event attended by the former Labour leader Ed Miliband and greater Manchester mayoral candidate Andy Burnham, the thinktank will launch a \u201cnew agenda\u201d that looks beyond Westminster to institutions such as devolved government, forward-looking businesses, and trade union and community-led campaigns.</p>",

When a child is born into poverty they miss out. They miss out on school trips, nutritional meals and warm, dry clothes and homes.

Its drive to reduce sugar and calories in foodstuffs by 20% by 2020 as part of the government\u2019s childhood obesity strategy would help, said Dr Alison Tedstone, its chief nutritionist.<br></p>",
  "<p>Cuts to legal aid are far worse than anticipated and are creating a \u201ctwo-tier\u201d system which denies the poorest people access to justice, warns a critical report by Amnesty International.</p> <p>The government should conduct an urgent review of the impact of the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders (Laspo) Act, which came into effect in 2013 and has severely restricted funding, the study says. A review has been promised within three to five years but ministers have delayed.</p> <p>The year before the act was introduced, legal aid was granted in 925,000 cases, Amnesty points out. The year after, assistance was given in 497,000 cases, a drop of 46%.</p> <p>The report calls for all children to be granted entitlement to legal aid regardless of the issues at stake. Some teenagers, it says, are at risk of having to represent themselves in immigration cases where they may face deportation.</p> <p>The report highlights the emergence of \u201cadvice deserts\u201d across England and Wales where the provision of free legal advice is disappearing. Worst affected are said to be the south-west, parts of the Midlands and the north of England. <br></p> <p>The Legal Aid Agency\u2019s exceptional case funding system, which was supposed to provide a safety net for the most vulnerable claimants, is said to be inadequate and flawed. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Laspo has been blamed for a surge in the number of litigants in person, slowing court processes. Legal aid is no longer available in the family courts unless one partner can prove he or she was a victim of domestic violence.</p> <p>One consequence has been that separating couples are not evenly represented. One woman told Amnesty: \u201cWhen I go to court I have to cross-examine my ex. That terrifies me. I have so many sleepless nights. If I lose I know I will blame myself \u2013 it\u2019s because I wasn\u2019t good enough. But then I think, how can I be good enough when I\u2019m up against a barrister?\u201d</p> <p>Legal aid for immigration cases has also been cut, exposing unaccompanied or separated children to having to make applications to stay in the UK on their own, unrepresented. The report says up to 2,500 children a year are claimants in their own right in such cases, according to MoJ figures.</p> <p>Children are at an \u201cautomatic disadvantage as the laws, processes and systems governing their circumstances are profoundly complex\u201d, the report states. \u201cThey require specialist advisers that are experienced not just in immigration law, but also with working with children.\u201d</p> <p> One lawyer told Amnesty: \u201cThe idea that children and young people can represent themselves just does not work. This is such a vulnerable group. It\u2019s not just that they don\u2019t understand legal processes and legal concepts, which they don\u2019t, but it\u2019s also that they have no idea how to fill forms out properly, what to write, where to send paperwork, where to get advice and who to speak to.\u201d</p> <p>A youth worker told Amnesty: \u201cI had one young person I was working with who had to self-represent at the lower asylum and immigration tribunal. He had a good case, but no access to legal aid \u2026 I accompanied him to court, explaining that I wouldn\u2019t be able to help him as I\u2019m not qualified but could give him moral support. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u201cHe was vulnerable, he didn\u2019t know what to expect. I had to explain everything: what the court looks like, what the environment will be. He didn\u2019t know, he hadn\u2019t seen any of it before. All he could do was tell his story to the judge, he couldn\u2019t argue the case law \u2026 We asked for an adjournment but the court said no. In the end his appeal was refused.\u201d </p> <p>Alice Wyss, Amnesty International\u2019s UK researcher, said: \u201cCuts to legal aid imposed by this government have decimated access to justice and left thousands of the most vulnerable without essential legal advice and support. We are in danger of creating a two-tier civil justice system, open to those who can afford it, but increasingly closed to the poorest and most in need of its protection.</p> <p>\u201cIf Theresa May is really determined to deliver a country that works for all then there needs to be a justice system for everyone, not just those who can afford it.The government must start by protecting the most vulnerable and launching a review of this failing system immediately.\u201d</p> <p>A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said: \u201cWe have a generous legal aid system - last year spending more than \u00a31.5bn on legal aid. We must ensure legal aid is sustainable and fair - both for those who need it and the taxpayer who pays for it. That is why we have made sure support remains available to the most vulnerable and in the most serious cases, and are taking action to ensure people can access the help they need.\u201d</p> <p><br></p>",

However, with this research showing that for many graduates, the costs of university education outweigh its personal economic benefits, we need a much stronger focus on creating more high-quality alternative pathways into the workplace, such as higher level apprenticeships, so we really do achieve parity of esteem between the two routes.\u201d</p> <p>The CIPD report is likely to intensify the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/aug/10/more-than-a-third-of-uk-graduates-regret-attending-university\">debate about whether university courses are good value for all students</a>. Supporters of the current approach say that limiting numbers would result in higher education being dominated by children from better-off families, and that courses increasingly have a vocational bent to prepare young people better for their careers.</p> <p>But the CIPD said the Brexit vote made it important for the government to take stock of policy towards higher education and skills.</p> <p>It called on ministers to improve the quality of careers advice to ensure young people are better informed about their future careers; a shift in emphasis on apprenticeships to make quality of courses a higher priority than the numbers involved; and a clear focus in the government\u2019s forthcoming industrial strategy on creating more high-skilled jobs.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/aug/18/gap-between-graduate-and-non-graduate-wages-shows-signs-of-waning\">Gap between graduate and non-graduate wages 'shows signs of waning'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cIt goes without saying that the UK needs a world-class higher education system, but this report really does provide a reality check on the assumption that continually increasing the numbers of people going to university truly adds the right value for learners of all ages, employers and the economy,\u201d Cheese said. </p> <p>\u201cGraduates are increasingly finding themselves in roles which don\u2019t meet their career expectations, while they also find themselves saddled with high levels of debt.

  "<p>Lest there be any doubt, Donald Trump made clear Monday that he is running a scorched earth campaign for the next month.<br></p> <p>Speaking in a high school gym in Beaver County, Pennsylvania, his first public event since the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/07/donald-trump-leaked-recording-women\">leak on Friday of his 2005 comments about</a> groping women without their consent, Trump amplified <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/10/debate-donald-trump-threatens-to-jail-hillary-clinton\">his rhetoric from Sunday night\u2019s debate</a> and attacked rival Hillary Clinton and her husband \u2013 former president Bill Clinton \u2013 in starkly personal terms. </p> <p>Trump, who <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/09/donald-trump-women-bill-clinton-sex-scandal-hillary-debate\">invited four women</a> who claimed to be the victims of misconduct by the Clintons to be his guests at the debate on Sunday, renewed his offensive against his Democratic opponent. </p> <p>The Republican nominee called Bill Clinton \u201ca predator\u201d and said his wife enabled him \u201cinstead of trying to stop it, she made possible for him to take advantage of more women, she put more women into harm\u2019s way\u201d.</p> <p>He also threatened that \u201cif they want to release more tapes saying inappropriate things, we\u2019ll continue to talk about Bill and Hillary doing inappropriate things.\u201d</p> <p>Trump also referenced the Chappaquiddick incident \u2013 in which a woman died after a car being driven by the late senator Ted Kennedy went off a bridge in 1969. Trump cited the incident as another example of Democratic scandals covered up by the media. </p> <p>The speech came as Republican leaders <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/10/paul-ryan-ends-support-trump-campaign-endorsement-republicans\">increase their efforts</a> to distance themselves from their party\u2019s nominee. Speaker Paul Ryan told members of the House GOP caucus on Monday \u201cyou all need to do what\u2019s best for your district\u201d and seemed to write off Trump\u2019s chances of winning, saying he would \u201cspend his entire energy making sure that Hillary Clinton does not get a blank check with a Democrat-controlled Congress\u201d. </p> <p>After widespread condemnation over his debate threat to jail his political rival, Trump did not explicitly renew his calls to jail Hillary Clinton if he was elected. Instead, he took a somewhat milder tone and merely called for a special prosecutor to investigate Clinton. Trump also suggested \u2013 without evidence \u2013 that the NSA might have the missing emails that Clinton deleted from her personal email server.</p> <p>But Trump also attacked Clinton on policy grounds. He railed against the Democratic nominee from the left on entitlement reform and claimed that she wants to \u201cknock the hell out of Medicare and Medicaid\u201d. The former secretary of state has committed to expanding both programs. </p> <p>He also attacked Clinton for her support for \u201copen trade\u201d. \u201cYou know what that does to your community,\u201d Trump asked the crowd. \u201cIt\u2019s the end.\u201d He also returned to familiar attacks and falsely claimed Clinton is \u201cfor radical unlimited immigration\u201d.</p> <p>Trump <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/02/donald-trump-renews-voter-warning-and-says-clinton-could-be-crazy\">once again offered a</a> vague, evidence-free warning of voter fraud in Pennsylvania. He told the almost entirely all-white crowd \u201cit\u2019s so important that you watch other communities because we don\u2019t want this election stolen from us\u201d. He has made this statement several times in the past in the Keystone state, seemingly based on a popular <a href=\"http://billypenn.com/2016/08/08/what-sean-hannity-got-wrong-about-philly-election-fraud/\">rightwing conspiracy theory</a> that Mitt Romney was the victim of voter fraud in Philadelphia in 2012. The theory, which is a dogwhistle reference to African American voters, is premised on the fact that in 59 precincts in majority black neighborhoods, Romney did not receive a single vote. There are 1,687 precincts in the city and Obama received over 85% of the vote there in 2012.</p> <p>While a <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/first-read/poll-after-trump-tape-revelation-clinton-s-lead-double-digits-n663691\">new NBC/WSJ poll</a> showed the Republican nominee falling behind Clinton by 14 points in a two-way race, Trump supporters in Pennsylvania were unfazed by the nominee\u2019s growing woes. Instead they took heart in what they saw as a dominating debate performance, one which former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani told the crowd was \u201cthe best performance any presidential candidate had in the history of debates\u201d.</p> <p>Joe Tedeski, a Trump supporter who watched the debate, thought his candidate won while Clinton was \u201cthe greatest liar I\u2019ve ever seen\u201d. He dismissed concerns about Trump\u2019s remarks saying \u201cpeople change, attitudes change\u201d and insisting that Trump\u2019s graphic description of groping women without their consent was \u201cjust talk\u201d and that he had never actually engaged in that behavior. </p> <p>This was echoed by Isaac Foldi of Bloomingdale, Ohio, who was decked out in Trump merchandise for the event and praised his candidate\u2019s performance. In particular, Foldi pointed to Trump\u2019s line that Clinton was \u201cno honest Abe\u201d as an effective zinger.

Johansen, the chairman of Bendigo and Adelaide Bank, has been chairman of the board since 2012.</p> <p>Some of the tension appears to have arisen from a new project spearheaded by Jaspan, the establishment of a sixth website, Global, funded by the US Carnegie Foundation. He is also editor-in-chief of Global, which is now in pilot stage, as well as the other five websites.</p> <p>One proposal being discussed is for Jaspan to retain the title of editor-in-chief, concentrating on expanding the Conversation in other markets, but relinquish control of the Australian operation. But some staff are said to be unhappy about this possibility.</p> <p>Jaspan was on the verge of a trip to the US when he was sent on leave and the trip was cancelled.</p> <p>He co-founded the Conversation after editing Fairfax Media\u2019s the Age between 2004 and 2008. He has also edited the Observer in London and the Scotsman and Scotland on Sunday.</p> <p>The Melbourne-based editor has not returned calls from Guardian Australia.</p> <p>The enforced leave request came the month after the former vice-chancellor of Canberra University, Prof Stephen Parker, joined the Conversation. As director of strategy, development and global, Parker is responsible for the growth strategy for the Conversation\u2019s expanding global network.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve followed closely the development and growth of the Conversation since its inception,\u201d Parker <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/uc-vice-chancellor-stephen-parker-to-join-the-conversation-57577\">said when he was appointed</a>. \u201cIt is poised now to become the main global platform whereby the amazing research and expertise at our universities is made available to a thinking public.\u201d</p> <p>Jaspan has been a controversial figure in Australia. <a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/national/age-editor-sacked-from-his-position-20080827-43gu.html\">In 2008 he was sacked by the Age</a> after a newsroom revolt in which 235 journalists passed a motion saying he undermined their ability to report without fear or favour.</p> <p>The British editor was the most senior scalp in a cost-cutting round implemented by the then Fairfax chief executive for Victoria, Don Churchill, who said the company needed \u201cfresh editorial\u201d leadership.</p> <p>But Churchill did praise Jaspan\u2019s \u201cmagnificent job in reinvigorating the Age\u201d.</p> <p>Working under the slogan \u201cacademic rigour, journalistic flair\u201d, the Conversation employs professional editors to work with academics.

  "<p>The publisher of the Daily Telegraph has been fined \u00a380,000 for unlawfully identifying the teenage victim of former England footballer Adam Johnson.<br></p> <p>Telegraph Media Group apologised unreservedly for using the pixelated image, which was taken from the 15-year-old\u2019s Facebook page.</p> <p>The Crown Prosecution Service took action over a story and picture published by the Telegraph on 3 March, the day after the former Sunderland midfielder was convicted of child sexual activity. It is a criminal offence under the Sexual Offences Act to identify any alleged victim of a sexual offence unless that person has waived their right to lifelong anonymity.</p> <p>Westminster magistrates court heard that the Telegraph had only sold four copies of that edition of the paper in the area where Johnson\u2019s victim lived, but the court was told that the Telegraph Media Group accepted that the pixelated image was likely to identify her.</p> <p>Gavin Millar QC, for the publisher, said the newspapers would no longer use such pictures with reports of sex offence cases.</p> <p>The pixelated image was the same as that used by the Sun in March 2015 which led to the newspaper\u2019s then editor, David Dinsmore, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/mar/07/adam-johnson-former-sun-editor-david-dinsmore-convicted-victim-picture\">having to pay \u00a32,300 in costs and compensation</a>.</p> <p>The Telegraph Media Group, which admitted a charge under sections 1 (2) and 5 (1) of the Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act 1992, was fined \u00a380,000 and ordered to pay the teenager \u00a310,000 in compensation, as well as \u00a31,473 in prosecution costs and a victim surcharge of \u00a3120.</p> <p>The publisher said in a statement: \u201cAs we made clear in court, we have apologised unreservedly to the victim for the distress she has been caused. The picture should not have been published and we have put in place robust procedures to ensure that such an error can never happen again.\u201d</p> <p>The \u00a35,000 limit on fines which magistrates could impose was lifted when relevant parts of section 85 of the Legal Aid, Punishment and Sentencing of Offenders Act 2012 were brought into effect from 12 March 2015 after the Sun\u2019s publication. The maximum fine the Sun could have faced was \u00a35,000, but the Telegraph Media Group faced a court which had power to fine it an unlimited amount.</p> <p>In the case of the Sun, the image of Johnson and the girl was cut out from the original photo on Facebook and put on to a white background before photoshopping and airbrushing were used to leave the girl with a blank face.</p> <p>The Sun team then took a photograph of the Irish president, Michael Higgins, at a tree-planting ceremony in a Dublin park and used Photoshop to remove all of the people so the remainder could be used as the background in the picture of Johnson and the girl.</p> <p>The Sun\u2019s article also included a warning that anyone who identified the child online would face prosecution and referred to a case in which people were convicted of identifying a sexual offence victim on social media.</p> <p>The teenage victim told Johnson\u2019s trial that she had suffered a huge backlash after she was identified online as the complainant.</p> <p>She told the court: \u201cThe gossip on social media and hearing all of the horrible names that people have been calling me has been devastating to me, my friends and my family. People were lying about me and what I had said.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Ireland\u2019s government has confirmed that discussions are under way with Britain to try to reach an agreement on how to secure the two countries\u2019 borders after Brexit, control immigration and counter terrorist threats.</p> <p>Irish and British immigration officials are already sharing intelligence about foreign visitors passing through airports and ferry ports by measures such as the personal information from biometric passports, the Department of Justice in Dublin said on Monday. It said the sharing of information from points of entry into both states was also part of a strategy to counter terrorism and organised crime.</p> <p>A spokesman for the department said: \u201cClearly it is in the best interests of both Ireland and the UK to cooperate as fully as possible on these matters and that has been the approach adopted by both jurisdictions going back many years, including the introduction earlier this year of new arrangements to allow for the sharing of advanced passenger information between Ireland and the UK in order to further enhance the integrity of the common travel area (CTA).</p> <p>\u201cThe development of the British-Irish visa system was facilitated by this arrangement and indeed could not have happened without the electronic sharing of information such as biometrics.\u201d</p> <p>As well as protecting the Anglo-Irish CTA, the Irish justice spokesman said there were mutual security concerns that prompted more cooperation in areas such as immigration control. \u201cNegotiations on the UK\u2019s exit from the EU have not yet begun and this process will of course involve a negotiation between the UK and all EU member states,\u201d he said. \u201cAny commentary now on what may emerge from those negotiations is speculative.</p> <p>\u201cHowever, it should be noted that it is vital, not just for Ireland but for all EU member states, that we are in a position to combat terrorism and serious crime through the sharing of relevant information in an appropriate manner. There are a number of ongoing EU initiatives in this area in which Ireland is committed to playing a full part.\u201d</p> <p>Earlier on Monday, two Irish government ministers said the republic <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/10/idea-of-uk-border-controls-in-ireland-is-ridiculous-says-irish-mep-matt-carty\">would be prepared to allow for extra monitoring at its airports and ferry terminals</a> to help the UK control post-Brexit immigration.</p> <p>The finance minister, Michael Noonan, said there could be the usual \u201cnormal checks\u201d at points of entry into Ireland which would keep tabs on any illegal immigration using the Irish border to enter the UK.</p> <p>Even though Northern Ireland voted 54% in favour of staying in the EU, the overall outcome of the 23 June referendum means the region will be outside the EU when Britain leaves. <br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/10/brexit-plan-divide-britain-ireland-uk-border\">This Brexit plan will divide Britain and Ireland once more | Diarmaid Ferriter</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In response to the proposal by the Northern Ireland secretary, James Brokenshire, for a new ramped-up intelligence system between the republic and the UK to clamp down on illegal migrants, Noonan said: \u201cSo, if you do not have a border, going from Newry going across, dividing Sligo and Donegal from the northern counties, the next step is to have your controls at the ports.</p> <p>\u201cSo that would mean Rosslare, and Larne [sea ports], and the airports, but that wouldn\u2019t be much more than the normal checks we have at airports already, where you show your passport.\u201d</p> <p>Noonan and his cabinet colleague, the Irish justice minister, Frances Fitzgerald, welcomed Brokenshire\u2019s opposition to any \u201chard border\u201d arrangements on the UK\u2019s only land frontier with an EU state as well as his promise that the CTA would continue after Brexit.</p> <p>Fitzgerald said there was \u201cnot anything surprising\u201d in Brokenshire\u2019s views and that such a move would avoid the re-establishment of a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic. He said: \u201cThe whole question of security in the ports as well as our interests is going to be an area where there is more focus on in relation to the risks of terrorism and security cooperation.</p> <p>\u201cI envisage the security co-operation continuing and developing if anything over the next number of years. There is not anything surprising in what he has said.\u201d</p> <p>Brokenshire had earlier told the Guardian that London and Dublin would work to strengthen Ireland\u2019s external borders in order to combat illegal migration into the UK once it left the EU.</p> <p>Brokenshire said there was now a \u201chigh level of collaboration on a joint programme of work\u201d between the two states to control immigration.</p> <p>\u201cWe have put in place a range of measures to further combat illegal migration working closely with the Irish government,\u201d Brokenshire said. \u201cOur focus is to strengthen the external border of the common travel area, building on the strong collaboration with our Irish partners.\u201d</p> <p>The Northern Ireland secretary added: \u201cWe are already working closely with the Irish government and other members of the common travel area to prevent people from seeking to evade UK immigration controls from entering via another part of the CTA. There is a high level of collaboration on a joint programme of work. This includes investment in border procedures; increased data sharing to inform immigration and border security decisions; passenger data systems enabling the collection and processing of advance passenger information; and harmonised visa processes.\u201d</p> <p>The Fine Gael-led coalition government has stressed, however, that any new intelligence gathering and data sharing system on people entering Ireland who may also travel into Northern Ireland must first win support among all of the republic\u2019s EU partners.</p> <p>Any system designed to enable the UK to control and monitor immigration via Ireland is bound to be politically controversial. One Sinn F\u00e9in MEP whose constituency includes the border region described Brokenshire\u2019s suggestion as ridiculous.</p> <p>Matt Carty, who represents the Midlands/Northwest constituency in the European parliament, said: \u201cThe Irish government and a succession of its representatives have been deferential to the British government from time to time. What we are saying is that this is not an occasion for this. </p> <p>\u201cWe need to be pointing out the needs of this island and making demands for the Irish people. It is not their job to be pushing for the wishes of the British government.\u201d</p>",

Despite much rhetorical and emotional attachment to reunification, and a disastrous IRA campaign targeting the border from 1956-62, pragmatism has dominated the southern Irish approach to the border question. Anglo-Irish and north-south relations noticeably improved from the 1960s, with a particular focus on trade. The outbreak of the Troubles, from the late 1960s, led to numerous crises but was eventually solved by the peace process and the Good Friday agreement of 1998. This agreement maintains that it is \u201cfor the people of the island of Ireland alone, by agreement between the two parts respectively and without external impediment, to exercise their right of self-determination\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2b46f48124675284fc005d13567e05546ecd3dae\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2b46f48124675284fc005d13567e05546ecd3dae/0_71_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Passport control at Dublin airport, where Britain wants tighter controls to be imposed\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Passport control at Dublin airport, where Britain wants tighter controls to be imposed.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Niall Carson/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Following the Brexit vote in June, when 56% of Northern Ireland\u2019s electorate voted to remain in the EU, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/19/brexit-northern-irish-politics-border-eu-good-friday-agreement\" title=\"\">historian Ian McBride argued</a> that the Good Friday agreement \u201cclearly envisaged that Northern Ireland\u2019s future constitutional arrangements would be worked out in the context of continuing partnership between the north and the south, and between politicians in London and Dublin\u201d.

  "<p>Canadians have taken to social media to defend their country\u2019s healthcare system after Donald Trump criticised it during the US presidential debate, characterising it as a slow, catastrophic system. <br></p> <p>Some 30 minutes into Sunday\u2019s heated debate, Canada\u2019s universal healthcare system \u2013 an <a href=\"http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/universal-health-care-much-loved-among-canadians-monarchy-less-important-poll/article5640454/\">unrivaled point of pride for most Canadians</a> \u2013 made a rare, if unflattering, appearance.</p> <p>The swipe came as Donald Trump responded to an audience question regarding the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare.

Miliband said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There is clearly a mandate for Brexit from this referendum but there is no mandate for the particular form of Brexit.</p> </blockquote> <p>And Clegg said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>On the basis of what constitutional principle do you believe that the prime minister can now arrogate to herself the exclusive right to interpret what Brexit means, impose it upon the country, rather than protect the rightful role of scrutiny and approval of this House?</p> </blockquote> <p>Some Tory MPs made the same point. But Davis argued that those arguing for the Commons to decide negotiating terms \u201ccannot tell the difference between accountability and micro-management\u201d. He said that MPs would get plenty of chances to debate the issue. But, dismissing calls for MPs to be given a binding vote on the Brexit negotiations, he said that it was important for the government to be able to negotiate what it thought was in the national interest without being constrained by having to declare full details of its negotiating position to MPs. Speaking for Labour, the shadow Brexit secretary<strong> Sir Keir Starmer </strong>said MPs should get a vote \u201con the basic terms\u201d of the renegotiation.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Davis refused to commit the government to publishing a white paper on the Brexit negotiations.</strong> He proposed one in an article he wrote as a backbencher in July, shortly before he was appointed to the cabinet, but, despite being asked repeatedly, refused to commit the government to publishing such document.</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>He claimed that the terms \u201chard\u201d and \u201csoft\u201d Brexit were \u201cdesigned to deceive\u201d and \u201cnot meaningful in any way\u201d.</strong></li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>He hinted that the government might accept a transitional trade deal with the EU if it could not agree a final one within two years. </strong>Labour\u2019s <strong>Hilary Benn</strong> said a transitional deal might be necessary to stop the UK having to trade with the EU on World Trade Organisation terms if, after two years, a permanent trade deal has not been finalised. Benn asked if Davis agreed. Davis said he did not expect this to happen. But he went on:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I\u2019m not going to offer a view. I will just simply say this; we are going to do everything possible to protect, enhance and maximise the opportunities for British business. And he can draw his conclusion. </p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He said that the government could not stop the pound going up and down during the Brexit process. </strong>In response to a question from Labour\u2019s <strong>Emma Reynolds</strong> about why the pound dropped to a 30-year low after the Conservative conference, he replied:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I recommend you read a book called Flash Boys because part of that fall, the major part of that fall was the flash crash as a result of that. Otherwise, there are lots and lots of speculative comments that will drive the pound down and up and down and up in the next two-and-a-half years and there\u2019s little we can do about that.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He said there would be no downside to Brexit and only \u201cconsiderable upsides\u201d if the government got what it wanted. </strong>The government had four goals, he said.</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>One is to regain control of our borders. Another is to get back control of our laws. The one I did not list was our aim to keep our justice and security arrangements at least as strong as they are. Finally, and most importantly in this context, the United Kingdom must aim to maintain the best possible open access to European markets and vice versa. If we can achieve all that, there will be no downside to Brexit at all, and considerable upsides.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He said he expected EU leaders to compromise during the Brexit talks.</strong> What they were saying now was not what they would be saying in the future, he said.

Bear in mind five out of six migrants either have or will have ILR, indefinite leave to remain, by the time we depart the union. </p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He refused to commit the government to retaining single market membership. </strong>Asked about this, he said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The single market, of course, is one description of the way the European Union operates but there are plenty of people who have access to the single market, some of them tariff-free, who make a great success of that access and it\u2019s the success we are aiming for.</p> </blockquote> <p>That\u2019s all from me for tonight.</p> <p>Thanks for the comments.</p> <p><em>UPDATE: </em>I have updated one of the paragraphs above to include the full quote where David Davis was talking about no downside to Brexit to make it clear that he was saying this on the assumption the government got what it wanted.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-10-11T07:56:01.607Z\">at 8.56am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57fbcd55e4b015d5d43fb6bd\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-10T17:20:10.199Z\">6.20pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Speaker turns down application for emergency debate on Brexit negotiating terms</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>John Bercow,</strong> the Commons Speaker, rejects the application for an emergency vote.</p> <p>He says he has taken the decision in accordance with rules that oblige him to consider whether the topic will be raised in the Commons by other means.

Earlier,<strong> Ed Miliband,</strong> the former Labour leader, told BBC News that MPs should vote on the Brexit strategy, not least to give the government a mandate.

He said he was not trying to enable MPs to reverse the referendum result.</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I am saying we are going to be leaving the European Union.

It was Philip Hammond, the chancellor, who said last week the British people did not vote to make themselves poorer. And he\u2019s right about that.

And I believe they need to get the consent of MPs. Because there is no other mandate here. The Conservative manifesto said that the Conservative party was determined to stay in the single market. Now, it sounded from what Theresa May and some of her ministers were saying that we were going to leave the single market, contrary to the mandate. So there is no mandate for a hard Brexit. That is why parliament has got to be consulted.</p> </blockquote> <p>On the World at One <strong>Dominic Grieve</strong>, the Conservative former attorney general, said MPs should be given the chance to vote on triggering article 50, the move that will start the formal EU withdrawal process. And <strong>Andrew Tyrie</strong>, the Conservative MP and chair of the Treasury committee, told the same programme that he thought MPs should debate the government\u2019s negotiating position.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It seems to me British interests will be best served by an early and full and detailed explanation from the government of what its negotiating position is before it embarks on those discussions ...</p> <p>What has never been discussed in any depth is what we arrive at.

It gives them a 17-point lead.</p> <p>Here are the new figures, and how they compare to the previous Guardian/ICM polling figures from early September, before the conference season started.</p> <p>Conservatives: 43% (up 2)<br></p> <p>Labour: 26% (down 2)</p> <p>Ukip: 11% (down 2)</p> <p>Lib Dems: 8% (down 1)</p> <p>Greens: 6% (up 2)</p> <p>The fieldwork was carried out from Friday to Sunday.</p> <p>The 17-point lead is the joint second highest ever recorded for the Conservatives by ICM in its polling series going back to 1992. They only once got a higher lead (20 points in June 2008, when Gordon Brown was at his most unpopular) although in September and October 2009 they also had a 17-point lead in ICM polls. But Labour did have larger polling leads at various points in the Blair era.</p> <p>At 26%, the Labour figure is only one point higher than their lowest rating in ICM polling - the 25% they hit in June 2008 and August 2009.</p> <p>The Conservative conference was dominated by news about Theresa May hardening up her stance on Brexit and the ICM figures suggest this has gone down well with voters. Although the proposal to force firms to reveal what proportion of their workforce is foreign has now been dropped, following a backlash from business,<a href=\"https://yougov.co.uk/news/2016/10/06/public-backs-plans-make-companies-say-how-many-for/\"> a YouGov poll at the end of last week suggested voters backed the idea by two to one.</a></p> <p>The Tories may also have benefited from the fall in the Ukip share of the vote. At 11% Ukip are on their lowest level in an ICM poll since the 2015 general election, and this may reflect the damage done to the party\u2019s reputation by the fight in the European parliament on Thursday that left Steven Woolfe MEP hospitalised.</p> <p><em> ICM Unlimited interviewed a representative online sample of 2,017 adults aged 18+ on 7-9<sup>th</sup> October 2016, and the data has been weighted to the profile of all adults. ICM is a member of the British Polling Council and abides by its rules.</em><br></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-10-10T11:07:13.912Z\">at 12.07pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57fb64f3e4b03258bcac633e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-10T10:06:58.098Z\">11.06am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>You can read all today\u2019s Guardian politics stories <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/all\">here.</a></p> <p>As for the rest of the papers, here is<a href=\"https://www.politicshome.com/must-reads\"> the Politics Home list of top 10 must-reads</a>, and here is<a href=\"http://www.conservativehome.com/frontpage/2016/10/newslinks-for-monday-10th-october-2016.html\"> the ConservativeHome round-up of today\u2019s politics stories.</a></p> <p>And here are two Brexit-related stories worth reading.</p> <ul> <li><strong><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/773a9770-8e34-11e6-8df8-d3778b55a923\">George Parker and Arash Massoudi in the Financial Times (subscription) say the government plans a new system of vetting foreign takeovers.</a></strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Theresa May is to push ahead with a new system to vet foreign investment in Britain, but has heeded warnings from chancellor Philip Hammond that the country cannot afford to adopt \u201cFrench-style\u201d protectionism.</p> <p>The UK prime minister wants the government to be able to intervene in an \u201corderly and structured\u201d way in sensitive foreign investment and is studying regimes used in other countries such as the US and Australia.</p> <p>But at a ministerial meeting last month Mr Hammond led a chorus of warnings that any new regime must not undermine Britain\u2019s position as Europe\u2019s top destination for foreign direct investment, particularly with Brexit approaching in 2019.</p> <p>\u201cWe can\u2019t go<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/12d7ac24-2433-11e2-94d0-00144feabdc0\"> down the Danone route</a>,\u201d Mr Hammond said, referring to action taken by the French government a decade ago that appeared to be intended to prevent a takeover of the yoghurt maker Danone.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong><a href=\"http://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/news/brexit-risks-closing-door-on-economy-bosses-warn-9ksg7n5x8\">Sam Coates in the Times (paywall) says the CBI has warned about Brexit being a threat to Britain\u2019s \u201copen economy\u201d.</a></strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The leader of Britain\u2019s biggest business group has warned Theresa May that she risks \u201cclosing the door\u201d on an open economy with her immigration clampdown and Brexit policy.</p> <p>Carolyn Fairbairn, director-general of the CBI, issued the stark message in an interview with <em>The Times </em>as the government climbed down on its plan to name businesses thought to be relying too heavily on foreign workers ...</p> <p>Ms Fairbairn, who took over at the CBI last year, said: \u201cWhat we have heard over the last few days, if you add up the messages in total, are signs that the door is being closed, to an extent, on the open economy, that has helped fuel investment.

Theresa May is visiting Denmark and the Netherlands and, with the Commons returning, it is possible that we may get an urgent question on Brexit.</p> <p>Here is the agenda for the day.<br></p> <p><em>11am:</em> Number 10 lobby briefing.</p> <p><em>Lunchtime: </em>Theresa May arrives in Copenhagen for a meeting with the Danish prime minster, Lars Lokke Rasmussen.</p> <p><em>Afternoon:</em> May arrives at the Hague for a meeting with the Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte.</p> <p><em>Afternoon:</em> Further details of the Labour reshuffle are due to be announced.</p> <p><em>3.30pm:</em> Possible urgent question on Brexit.</p> <p>As usual, I will be covering the breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web. I will post a summary at lunchtime and another in the afternoon.</p> <p>If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AndrewSparrow\">@AndrewSparrow.</a></p> <p>I try to monitor the comments BTL but normally I find it impossible to read them all.

  "<p>Giving a running commentary on not giving a running commentary is getting to be a habit. Rather than be dragged back to the Commons to face an urgent question on his department\u2019s opacity, Brexit minister David Davis chose instead to volunteer a statement. \u201cLet me be absolutely clear,\u201d Grumpy announced, as his fellow dwarves Happy aka Boris Johnson, Dopey aka Priti Patel and Smarmy aka Liam Fox bounced on the benches beside him in a contrived sense of jollity.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/oct/10/ed-miliband-mps-parliamentary-vote-brexit-terms-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/56p8f\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2793759\"            data-video-name=\"Ed Miliband: MPs should vote on Brexit terms \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"ITN\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57fb9f5fe4b03b4fd4fa5f5b\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/10/10/161010EdMiliband_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/10/10/161010EdMiliband_V3.webm\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/10/10/161010EdMiliband.m3u8\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/oct/10/ed-miliband-mps-parliamentary-vote-brexit-terms-video\">Ed Miliband: MPs should vote on Brexit terms</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>All that was absolutely clear was that Grumpy was accidentally rereading the statement he had made to the house at the beginning of September. \u201cWe are going to take back control,\u201d he said. \u201cControl is something we will be taking back. Oh yes. We have been given the biggest mandate in the whole history of mandates being given and because of this mandate we will be taking back control. Nothing shall stop us taking back control.\u201d</p> <p>This may have been Keir Starmer\u2019s first outing as shadow Brexit minister but he was savvy enough to identify time standing still with Grumpy doing everything to avoid talking about membership of the single market. Leaving the EU wasn\u2019t the issue, he said. That was a done deal. What he wanted to know was the terms on which the UK was going to leave the EU and to make sure that parliament got a chance to debate and vote on them. Surely the whole point of taking back control was returning sovereignty to parliament?</p> <p>Grumpy began to flush. It had been so much more fun to shout the Eurosceptic odds from the backbenches than to have to implement it as a minister. \u201cWhat you have to realise is that we have the biggest mandate in the whole history of mandates,\u201d he muttered, his eyes dead, as he rifled through the blank pages of briefing notes his advisers had given him.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/oct/10/jeremy-corbyn-labour-rehsuffle-continues-labour-reshuffle-politics-live\">Brexit statement: David Davis rejects calls for MPs to vote on negotiating terms  - Politics live</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cSo when I say that we are going to take back control what I mean is that we will return sovereignty to parliament except for those matters on which I think I might not get the result I want. Take back control. Take back control . Mandate. Mandate. Whirr. Whirr. Clunk. Clunk.\u201d A metal shard flew out of Grumpy\u2019s mouth and landed on the despatch box.</p> <p>To give Grumpy\u2019s minders enough time to replace his broken part, Iain Duncan Smith stepped in with his customary diversionary tactic of proving he is one of the most unpleasant man in Westminster. \u201cThe shadow Brexit secretary is just a second rate lawyer,\u201d he sneered. It takes a second-rater to know a second-rater.</p> <p>\u201cTake back control. Mandate. Whirr. Clunk,\u201d Grumpy garbled. The repairs to Grumpy\u2019s mechanism had not been entirely successful and he was reduced to acting on auto-pilot. The Tory MP Stephen Phillips, who is one of the sharpest minds in the Commons and certainly one of its best paid lawyers, shook his head and laughed. Phillips knew Grumpy was trying to bluff his way through the unconstitutionality of the government\u2019s position but was just politely biding his time.</p> <p>But not so loyal that he had not provided the opposition with some of his best attack lines. First Ed Miliband, then Nick Clegg, then Hilary Benn exposed the hypocrisy of Theresa May assigning herself the right to decide exactly what Brexit means. Even Tory Andrew Tyrie gently pointed out the absurdity of the British public finding out what deal their government had got from the other countries it had been negotiating with.</p> <p>The Eurosceptics were outraged that anyone should dare to take back control of what they they wanted to take back control of. Owen Paterson insisted he would be happy for the pound to worthless as long as Britain left the EU. Four badgers entered the chamber to remove him. Jacob Rees-Mogg, one of Donald Trump\u2019s last remaining supporters in the UK, was removed by four silverback gorillas. The Commons was thinning out.</p> <p>\u201cTake back control. It would be trespassing on parliament to involve parliament. Mandate. Whirr. Clunk,\u201d Grumpy sighed, while pushing one of his eyeballs back into its socket.</p> <p>At the close of the statement, Phillips asked the Speaker for an emergency debate on the unconstitutionality of the government\u2019s position. John Bercow bottled it and declined. Grumpy flashed his grill. Brexit would blood well mean Brexit even if it turned out to be a disaster. Take back control. Mandate. Whirr. Clunk.</p>",

Data reported by the New York Times last week suggests that different kinds of doctors tend to have very different political views. My experiences lead me to believe that this empathy gap can be traced to the mix of patients that clinicians care for. The more doctors get out of their privilege bubble, the more likely they are to support keeping, and strengthening, the ACA.</p> <p>All doctors bear witness to the lives of others. But whom we meet depends in part on what insurance we accept. <a href=\"http://www.commonwealthfund.org/~/media/files/publications/fund-report/2013/jun/1691_felland_improving_access_specialty_care_medicaid_v2.pdf\">Medical specialists</a> including cardiologists and orthopedic surgeons and are less likely to take patients on Medicaid than are primary care doctors, pediatricians and infectious-disease docs. </p> <p>Poverty, discrimination and other social factors also increase the risk of certain diseases such as HIV, hepatitis, childhood asthma, obesity, high blood pressure and depression. So certain medical specialists, like me, see a higher proportion of patients from backgrounds vastly different from our own. Call it empathy boot camp.</p> <p>One of my patients has been to the hospital six times in as many months because her asthma flares up every time she smokes crack cocaine. She lives with her elderly mother and can\u2019t move, and it\u2019s hard for her to quit when most of her neighbors smoke crack too. Another of my patients had PCP, a severe pneumonia related to HIV/Aids, which required treatment with multiple medications. She left the hospital against our advice because she doesn\u2019t feel comfortable asking family, friends or neighbors to look after her kids. </p> <p>I have another patient who bounces around from hospital to hospital looking for safety from her abusive partner. Another patient with advanced Aids refused to go to a nursing home where he would have gotten help taking his dozens of medications, three square meals a day, substance abuse treatment services and physical therapy. He was afraid of losing the apartment he shared with his HIV-uninfected girlfriend, leaving her homeless. He died. This is just a sample of patients I saw in one month.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/dec/15/obamacare-health-insurance-deadline-aca-election-2016\">Obamacare isn't perfect, but it's a start \u2013 and it's better than the nothing we had | Liz Seegert</a> </p> </aside>  <p>My patients have shown me it\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2016/03/homeless-patients/475830/\">nearly impossible</a> to get someone healthy when they don\u2019t have <a href=\"http://www.cc.com/video-clips/lntv3q/the-daily-show-with-jon-stewart-the-homeless-homed\">stable housing</a>.

  "<p>The international footballer Ched Evans has told the jury at his retrial that a teenager he is accused of raping consented to sex with him.</p> <p>Evans, who has played for Manchester City, Sheffield United and Wales, claimed the 19-year-old woman enjoyed having sex with him and rejected the allegation she was too intoxicated to consent. </p> <p>He also denied that it was \u201csinister\u201d to have left the hotel where the alleged rape took place via a fire door. He claimed it was a convenient short cut to the main road from the hotel, located in the seaside town of Rhyl in north Wales. </p> <p> The woman had told the jury that she woke up naked in the room with no memory of getting there and fearing she had been attacked after her drinks were spiked. The prosecution alleges she could not possibly have consented to sex as she was too intoxicated. Evans denies rape. </p> <p> In the witness box at Cardiff crown court, Evans was asked by his barrister, Judy Khan QC: \u201cDuring sex was she consenting?\u201d He replied: \u201cYes.\u201d </p> <p> \u201cHow did you know that?\u201d the barrister asked. \u201cFrom how she was acting, what she said to me,\u201d Evans replied.</p> <p>Khan asked: \u201cIs there any doubt in your mind that she was consenting?\u201d Evans replied: \u201cNo.\u201d</p> <p> \u201cHow did she seem to you?\u201d the barrister asked. \u201cShe seemed like she was having sex and enjoying herself,\u201d Evans said.</p> <p>The QC continued: \u201cDid she appear too drunk to consent?\u201d \u201cNo\u201d. \u201cDid she appear to know what was going on around her?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cIf she had been too drunk to consent, would you have had sex with her?\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d</p> <p>Khan concluded her examination by asking: \u201cDid you rape [the woman]?\u201d Evans replied: \u201cNo.\u201d</p> <p>Evans claims that he and another footballer, Clayton McDonald, had consensual sex with the teenager. The jury has been told that McDonald \u201chooked\u201d the teenager when she was heavily intoxicated following a night out in the early hours of 30 May 2011.</p> <p>Evans was convicted of rape in April 2012 but his appeal was allowed. The jury has been told that in 2013 a website offered a \u00a350,000 reward for information leading to his acquittal. That was removed from the website in October 2015 when the case was referred to the appeal court, the court heard. McDonald was cleared of rape. </p> <p>At the start of his testimony on day four of his trial, Evans told the jury he signed for Manchester City when he was 13 and transferred to Sheffield United in 2009. He was capped for Wales 13 times. </p> <p>He said at the time of the alleged rape that he had a girlfriend called Natasha Massey and that they were still together. They had a son and planned to have more children and marry, he said. </p> <p>On the night of the alleged rape, Evans was in Rhyl with two friends he knew from his Manchester City days including McDonald. He told the jury he had booked a hotel room for his friend, who lived in Cheshire.</p> <p>He said his friends went out on the town. \u201cI was drunk but I was in control of myself,\u201d Evans told the jury. </p> <p>He became separated from McDonald and received a text message from him. It said \u201csomething along the lines I\u2019ve got a bird or I\u2019ve met a bird\u201d, Evans said. </p> <p>The footballer said he decided to go to the hotel. Asked why he said: \u201cTo see if I knew her. I was being juvenile, having a laugh, just being childish.\u201d</p> <p>Evans said he let himself into the hotel room without knocking. McDonald and the woman were having sex, he said. \u201cThe door slammed behind me. They both looked at me. Clay looked at her and said: \u2018Can my mate join in?\u2019 She looked at me and said: \u2018Yes.\u2019\u201d </p> <p>Evans said his younger brother and another man, who had accompanied him to the hotel, were outside at the window giggling. </p> <p>He told the jury the woman asked him to perform a sex act on her and then they had full sex. \u201cShe was making noises like she was enjoying herself,\u201d he said. Evans claimed the woman took the lead and used explicit language.</p> <p>McDonald left and Evans said he pulled away from the woman. \u201cThe situation I was in became real. I was cheating my girlfriend,\u201d he said. </p> <p>During cross-examination by prosecutor Simon Medland QC, Evans conceded he did not know the woman\u2019s name; he did not say goodbye; he did not thank her or kiss her as he left. Evans said: \u201cOn reflection I shouldn\u2019t have behaved that way.\u201d </p> <p>Medland told him: \u201cYou left the room and disappeared into the night.\u201d Evans said it was daylight when he left. </p> <p>The prosecutor suggested his decision to leave via the fire door was \u201csinister\u201d and he was covering his tracks. Evans replied: \u201cNo.\u201d He insisted there was no plan between him and McDonald. </p> <p>Evans was asked about CCTV footage from earlier that night in which the woman was seen falling over in a kebab shop. Evans said: \u201cIn the room she was not all over the place.\u201d </p> <p>Medland suggested the woman did not even know she was having sex with Evans at all. \u201cShe knew I was having sex with her. She looked at me as I came into the room,\u201d he said. </p> <p> The trial continues. </p>",

the Committee for the Economic Development of Australia event in Canberra on Monday.</p> <p>Australia\u2019s chief bureaucrat said the future of the country will be determined \u201cby the resourcefulness of its people, not the resources lying under it\u201d. </p> <p>Parkinson noted that in advanced countries, including Australia, growth in incomes has \u201cslowed markedly, with impacts on living standards and fiscal positions\u201d.</p> <p>By looking at multi-factor productivity, we can measure the rate of innovation in products and the processes for making them, he said.</p> <p>Parkinson warned that between the 1990s and 2000s average annual growth in multi-factor productivity fell by around a percentage point across several advanced economies and was barely positive in Australia over the past decade. </p> <p>Even when mining and utilities sectors are excluded, multi-factor productivity growth had \u201cfallen significantly over the past decade\u201d with 10 of 14 Australian market-sector industries recorded lower productivity growth over the past decade than the previous one.</p> <p>Parkinson examined a number of theories, including that productivity growth is slowing globally because the revolution in communications and information technology has not improved innovation as much as was once thought.</p> <p>The trend might be reversed when current technologies reached their productive potential, he suggested. \u201cIndeed, the prime minister has noted that in many cases we overestimate the short-term impact of an innovation and underestimate its long-term impact.\u201d</p> <p>But he concluded we \u201cjust do not know whether technological advance is speeding up or slowing down\u201d.</p> <p>Another explanation could be that ideas are not being taken up as quickly, he said, citing evidence that companies had fallen further behind those at the frontier of innovation.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\"

restrict new ideas, increasing access to data, and not penalising risk through the tax system.</p> <p>He said sometimes businesses failed after taking a \u201clegitimate risk\u201d and the government should avoid imposing costs like when \u201cbankruptcy penalises those able to start again or when the tax system fails to give due recognition for tax losses\u201d.</p> <p>Governments also needed to stop anti-competitive behaviour because it \u201cfavours incumbents over more potentially innovative\u201d and to stop protecting loss-making industries which \u201cstop resources flowing to more

Many organisations working on the global HIV and TB responses are shouting loudly about the funding alarm. It became even more urgent when the <a href=\"http://kff.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kaiser Family Foundation</a> found that global donor financing had reduced by 13% from 2014 to 2015. Our only way forward is to increase general public awareness and demand for donors and INGOs to increase HIV and TB funding up to 2020, and make it possible to end the epidemics by 2030. If not, we risk a terrifying rebound of the epidemics that we will struggle to get a grip on again. <em>Mike Podmore</em></p> <p><em>Read the full Q&amp;A <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/sep/29/live-qa-how-do-we-increase-the-hiv-response-with-limited-funds\">here</a>.</em></p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/global-development\">Join our community</a></strong><strong> of development professionals and humanitarians.

The conversations will be recorded and used on the podcast as their version of a live show.</p> <p>While a lot of podcasts shake up their formats with live shows in order to both connect with fans and keep things interesting for listeners, as a show on and about the internet, Reply All has struggled with how to make a live show work for them. \u201cWe have been talking for a long time about how to do a \u2018live\u2019 podcast. We actually tried to do a couple of call-in shows that we broadcast over the internet, but they never really came together,\u201d explains Goldman. \u201cSo we were thinking that maybe doing a live show in the studio was the wrong idea, because we were imitating broadcast radio, but we have so much more opportunity to try something totally new.\u201d</p> <p>That\u2019s when then they stumbled on the idea of giving their phone number to the internet. \u201cWe decided we should instead try to do it just in the world. Just be reachable wherever we were, no matter the time,\u201d said Goldman. \u201cSo we had a very smart friend set up a system so that when we get a call, it rings to both of our phones auto-conferences us in, and the entire call is recorded.\u201d </p> <p>If the thought of giving the entire internet your phone number gives you chills, as veteran reporters of the online world, Vogt and Goldman are well aware of the risks. \u201cI have no doubt it will include abuse, pranks, insanity and very little sleep,\u201d said Goldman. \u201cIt\u2019s exciting, and a little terrifying.\u201d</p> <p>Despite their concerns, for the next 48 hours, Vogt and Goldman will be standing by their phones to talk to whoever rings their bell to ask them if their refrigerator is running \u2013 or something far cleverer or even serious. \u201cWhat I expect to happen is we\u2019ll get a lot of hang-ups and a lot of pranks, a lot of people goofing around and screwing with us. I also suspect we\u2019ll probably get very little sleep,\u201d said Goldman.</p> <p>While Goldman has a few educated guesses about what lies in store for him when the internet comes calling, he\u2019s still eager to try it. \u201cWhat I hope happens is if someone feels like they have a question or they just need someone to talk to, they know that we\u2019ll be here,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re bound by the rules we set for ourselves to talk to them. And we\u2019ll listen.\u201d</p> <p>So when you\u2019re ready to talk or drunk enough to dial, or really want to try and convince Goldman and Vogt to check if their refrigerator is running, they will be waiting. The phone number is +1 646-490-1847. </p>",
  "<p>Earlier today <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/oct/10/can-you-solve-it-the-ping-pong-puzzle\">I set you the following puzzle</a>:</p> <p><em>Three friends (A, B and C) are playing ping pong. They play the usual way: the winner stays on, and the loser waits his/her turn again. At the end of the day, they summarise the number of games that each of them played:</em></p> <p><em>A played 10<br></em></p> <p><em>B played 15</em></p> <p><em>C played 17.</em></p> <p><em>Who lost the second game? </em></p> <p><strong>Solution</strong></p> <p>A</p> <p>First lets deduce how many games were played in total. If we add up the games that each of them played we get 10 + 15 + 17 = 42. Since each game requires two people, we half that number to get a total of 21 games.</p> <p>Now let\u2019s consider the <strong>minumum</strong> number of games it is possible for any player to play. This would be for a player who loses every time they play. If this losing player was in the first game, he/she would be out in the second game, play again in the third game, sit out the fourth, and so on. In other words the games played would be the odd-numbered games: 1-3-5-7-9-11-13-15-17-19-21. That\u2019s eleven games in total.</p> <p>But if this losing player sat out the first game, debuting instead in the second game, the player would play only the even numbered games: 2-4-6-8-10-12-14-16-18-20. That\u2019s ten games in total.</p> <p>The only possible way to play ten games is if only the even numbered games are played. Since A has played only 10 games, we can deduce A played in all the even games (and lost them all). So he/she lost the second game.</p> <p><em>.........................................</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"2e053d19d26ad5fdb78374ffd961eb5a85bec96f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2e053d19d26ad5fdb78374ffd961eb5a85bec96f/0_0_1843_2409/765.jpg\" alt=\"undefined\" width=\"765\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><em>I post a puzzle here on a Monday every two weeks.</em><br></p> <p><em>If you want to propose a puzzle for this column, please <a href=\"mailto:bellospuzzle@gmail.com\">email me</a> I\u2019d love to hear it.</em></p> <p><em>My book of puzzles <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/can-you-solve-my-problems.html/?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\">Can You Solve My Problems? </a>is out in three weeks time!

Wealthy and abashed GOP-ers gulped $29 glasses of Silver Oak cabernet and sidled up next to self-righteous silver-haired Democrat hippies to ask sheepishly for a toke off their joints, and we all, CEOs and chakra readers, dads and daughters, young and old, disappeared into the music.</p> <p>When golden gods of rock are your escorts, of course, that escape comes at a price: tickets alone already generated a cool $160m from the estimated 75,000 attendees. A general admission weekend pass to the fest cost $399, but to stand in line for overpriced wine with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/video/2016/oct/10/great-barrier-reef-legacy-invites-leonardo-dicaprio-to-join-its-campaign-video\">Leonardo DiCaprio</a> or Tommy Lee, both of whom were spotted at the festival, you had to pony up $1,599 for tickets in the pit. And if comfort trumped star sightings (and for most of the graying folks dressed in vacation-casual attire, I\u2019m guessing it did), you could nab a reserved, padded seat for somewhere in between.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fcbde4dcdc1aa61d2d2937e75628b1235ceeec91\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fcbde4dcdc1aa61d2d2937e75628b1235ceeec91/0_418_4532_2934/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Fans the Who perform at Empire Polo Club, Indio.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"647\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fans watch the Who perform at Empire Polo Club, Indio.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Ralston/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For the most part, the music was worth its eye-widening price tag. At 73, Mick Jagger strutted down the catwalk better than Cara Delevingne, who was watching the Rolling Stones\u2019 ecstatic set of nonstop hits. Dangling a cigarette from one hand and grinning crookedly, Keith Richards played with obvious joy. Neil Young delivered the best line of the festival (\u201cCome back tomorrow night \u2013 Roger\u2019s gonna build a wall and make Mexico great again\u201d) and ripped into a 20-plus-minute rendition of Down by the River. <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/paulmccartney\">Paul McCartney</a> stayed on stage for almost three hours, the Who roared what seemed to be the loudest set of the festival and Waters saved the whole thing from being stuck in the past by using the stage as a political platform.

Three of the four women have claimed inappropriate sexual contact with Bill Clinton, which he has denied.

  "<p>Bill Mollison, who has died aged 88, was one of the co-creators of permaculture, an agricultural system that works with, rather than against, nature, on the basis that the natural world holds the key to stable and productive systems. Having developed the concept, he then travelled from his native Tasmania for 30 years to embed his approach worldwide. His ideas have spread widely \u2013 permaculture is practised in more than 140 countries and by more than 3 million people \u2013 even though in the 1970s the idea was considered, in Mollison\u2019s words, \u201cthe highest form of sedition\u201d.</p> <p>Much of what he espoused was based on his great respect for the wisdom of subsistence farmers around the world, who have long used sustainable methods to grow their crops. In agricultural terms, this means planting diverse sets of crops, using perennial species to form productive stable systems, and ensuring the conditions for soils to be regenerated.</p> <p>Other characteristics that he observed in the Tasmanian wilderness informed permaculture, for instance that the interfaces between different habitats are the most productive and that elements such as plants and animals need to be placed together so they are mutually beneficial \u2013 as once when he pointed out: \u201cYou don\u2019t have a slug problem, you have a duck deficiency!\u201d</p> <p>Mollison pointed to further beneficial ecological consequences: \u201cThe only safe energy systems are those derived from biological systems. A New Guinea gardener can walk through the gates of his garden taking one unit of energy and hand out 70. A modern farmer who drives a tractor through the gate takes 1,000 units of energy in and gives one back. Who is the most sophisticated agriculturalist?\u201d He held that \u201calthough the problems of the world are increasingly complex, the solutions remain embarrassingly simple\u201d. Ecological systems would enable people to meet their own needs, take back control of their lives and reinforce nature rather than deplete it.</p> <p>Born in the fishing village of Stanley, on the north-west coast of Tasmania, Bill (whose given name was actually Bruce), was the son of Roland Mollison and his wife, Amy (nee Harmon). His parents ran a butter factory, and later built the village bakehouse that Bill took over at the age of 14 when his father died, delivering bread with a horse called Topsy.</p> <p>In his 20s, he worked as a fisherman, forester and trapper. He understood and celebrated the self-reliance of rural life in the 1930s and 40s, and his love of the natural world led him to join the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) in 1954, working in agricultural research for 10 years before leaving to study <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/science/biogeography\">biogeography</a>, the study of the distribution of plants and animals, at Hobart University.</p> <p>He was appointed a lecturer at Hobart in 1968, and some years later developed a new discipline, environmental psychology. At this stage he could have settled into a comfortable academic life. However, he felt increasingly trapped by traditional academia and sought instead to marry his studies in psychology with the natural world, seeking an elusive operating system that would inspire people through a systematic design process to build abundant and resilient lifestyles.</p> <p>At the age of 50, after his university peers had roundly rejected his plea for a cross-disciplinary holistic approach to their work, he turned his back on formal education. Joined by an environmental design student, David Holmgren, Mollison started to sketch out the origins of what we now know as permaculture. Nobody had put together the architecture for a regenerative design approach that drew on knowledge of traditional cultures while adapting to the opportunities of new technologies and systems thinking. It simply did not exist.</p> <p>Into this framework they introduced concepts from other ecological pioneers, indigenous cultures and peasant farmers, combining them with a keen observation of the natural world. In 1978 Mollison and Holmgren published Permaculture One, the precursor of Mollison\u2019s more detailed Permaculture \u2013 A Designers\u2019 Manual (1988). This was to become the \u201cpermaculture bible\u201d, and is still used as a reference text for teachers. It expands the concepts at the heart of agroecology, agroforestry, carbon farming, regenerative agriculture, sustainable architecture and local money systems, providing the intellectual framework that supports the continuing evolution of his ideas.</p> <p>Thereafter Mollison wanted to spread his ideas, and decided to teach an informal two-week course in permaculture, operating from what he dubbed \u201cThe People\u2019s Republic of Strickland Avenue\u201d, the street in Hobart where he and Holmgren lived. He devised a curriculum and shared it with anyone who might turn up \u2013 a move so audacious that it was laughable. As his students grew in confidence they taught similar 72-hour courses, and after 10 years of continuous touring and teaching, Mollison \u2013 with the help of his network of loosely affiliated teachers \u2013 had spread his ideas across five continents. In 1981 he received the <a href=\"http://www.rightlivelihoodaward.org/\">Right Livelihood award</a>.</p> <p>Although his original principles remain in place, the courses have evolved to expand beyond agriculture and into areas such as design, engineering, construction and architecture, all based on an ecological approach, and his ideas have been taken up by the international <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/jun/15/transition-towns-way-forward\">Transition Town</a> movement.</p> <p>Mollison had a brilliant mind. He observed, he catalogued, and his systematic approach helped him to weave seemingly disparate ideas into the most detailed tapestry. In this sense he was a true visionary. He was also challenging, angry, driven by a deep sense of injustice, and merciless if crossed. He used to say: \u201cFirst feel fear, then get angry. Then go with your life into the fight.\u201d</p> <p>He is survived by his fifth wife, Lisa, four daughters and two sons.</p> <p>\u2022 Bill (Bruce Charles) Mollison, ecologist, born 4 May 1928; died 24 September 2016</p>",

Neither Calleri, who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/11/west-ham-jonathan-calleri-loan-signing\" title=\"\">joined West Ham on loan</a> at the start of August, nor his Argentina Under-23 colleague Rulli, made a single appearance for Maldonado, who play their matches in front of crowds of <a href=\"http://www.transfermarkt.co.uk/club-deportivo-maldonado/besucherzahlenentwicklung/verein/18075\" title=\"\">less than 300</a> in a ramshackle stadium located in Uruguay\u2019s seventh most populated city.</p> <p>It\u2019s a similar story with their compatriot Hern\u00e1n Toledo, who joined Fiorentina on loan in the summer, while the Brazil left-back Alex Sandro and Paraguay\u2019s Marcelo Estigarribia are now long forgotten at the Estadio Domingo Burgue\u00f1o after being sold to Porto and Juventus respectively in 2011 without having pulled on a Maldonado shirt. Since 2009, when the club was sold to unidentified foreign investors, <a href=\"http://www.transfermarkt.co.uk/club-deportivo-maldonado/transfers/verein/18075/saison_id/\" title=\"\">they have spent almost \u00a328m</a> on players but never quite managed to win promotion in a division where average salaries are around \u00a3300 a month.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/09/world-football-endemically-corrupt-player-transfers-agents\">Football insiders claim world game is \u2018endemically corrupt\u2019 in player transfers</a> </p> </aside>  <p><a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-03-18/soccer-club-with-200-fans-earns-14-million-from-transfers\" title=\"\">An investigation by Bloomberg</a> in 2014 claimed the mysterious owners were none other than the English racehorse owner Malcolm Caine and the London-based lawyer Graham Shear, who became the president and vice-president respectively of a club who have been member-owned since 1928. According to the report, they bought Maldonado \u201cas a way of easing the tax burden of investors who own player transfer rights\u201d.</p> <p>Third-party ownership (TPO) was banned in most countries by that stage, although Fifa was slow to act and did not outlaw it until December 2014. Since then, four clubs \u2013 Santos, Sevilla, the Belgian club Sint-Truidense and FC Twente \u2013 have been fined for breaching TPO rules.</p> <p>That came a year after five South American clubs \u2013 Uruguay\u2018s Instituci\u00f3n Atl\u00e9tica Sud Am\u00e9rica and Argentina\u2019s Central C\u00f3rdoba, Independiente, Racing and Rosario Central \u2013 were also fined after being found to have employed so-called \u201cbridge transfers\u201d which involve the sale of players from one club to another via a third club for which he never plays. No such charges have been brought against Maldonado, which \u201cpays its players in accordance with the contractual obligations and fully accounts for and performs all tax and other statutory requirements\u201d, according to an email sent to Bloomberg by Caine. \u201cOur investment includes infrastructure, managerial, technical knowhow, medical and other facilities as well as player development, training and player transfers.\u201d</p> <p>There is no suggestion Fifa\u2019s rules on third-party ownership have been breached by Maldonado.</p> <p>When contacted by the Guardian, Shear, who was involved in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/jul/24/newsstory.sport12\" title=\"\">Carlos Tevez\u2019s move to Manchester United</a> from West Ham in 2007, explained he no longer held a position with the club, having resigned as a director in April 2010. Bloomberg and the Argentinian newspaper La Naci\u00f3n alleged Jonathan Barnett \u2013 a co-founder of the Stellar Group, which is rated as one of the world\u2019s most powerful agencies \u2013 was also connected to the club, but Shear denied that is the case.</p> <p>When contacted by the Guardian, Barnett \u2013 who co-owns several horses with Caine, including one called Curbyourenthusiasm \u2013 denied any involvement with Maldonado. Caine, who remains the owner of the club having signed a 15-year agreement in 2009, is said to have lost money since investing, having built a training ground and established a youth team. Pictures taken during last week\u2019s 3-1 win over CA Villa Teresa showed a dilapidated stadium with concrete steps for seating and a handful of supporters dotted around the stands.</p> <p>\u201cWe have confusing information concerning Deportivo Maldonado,\u201d said Pippo Russo, a sociologist from Florence University who has investigated third-party ownership in South America and beyond.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/28/association-football-agents-divided-response-sam-allardyce-exit\">Association of Football Agents admits system is open to abuse amid Allardyce fallout</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThere have been a lot of articles about them but they often have different points of view concerning the ownership of the club.\u201d</p> <p>In Uruguay, legislation means investors can save up to 40% in tax costs compared with Argentina or Brazil. Therefore players are able to sign a deal with a lower league club such as Maldonado and then be loaned out to a larger side involved in the Copa Libertadores in the hope they will be scouted by a big club in Europe. In 2013, in an effort to stop the practice, the Uruguayan football association increased the tax rate on player trades to 12.5% from 4%, although investors don\u2019t pay capital gains tax if they route income offshore through a Uruguayan company compared to facing 35% percent rate in Argentina.</p> <p>\u201cIt is the biggest fiscal tax haven in the continent and this has consequences for football,\u201d Russo said. \u201cThere are a lot of Argentinian agents and businessman who have become owners of clubs in Uruguay, and Chile as well.</p> <p>\u201cIn the general framework of South American football, clubs are owned and managed to bypass the rules of third-party ownership. This was the general trend I forecasted when the rules were introduced by Fifa. Deportivo Maldonado was a pioneer in arranging this sort of business.\u201d</p> <p>This is not the first time there have been claims Barnett and Stellar Group may have indulged in schemes to get around third-party ownership. The Dutch national broadcaster NOS <a href=\"http://nos.nl/nieuwsuur/artikel/2116306-hoe-de-mysterieuze-stellar-group-voetbalfamilies-verleidt.html\" title=\"\">ran a story in July</a> that detailed the cases of four young players whose parents have been employed by Stellar as agents in exchange for their sons\u2019 signatures.</p> <p>A court case brought by Stellar in February revealed the father of the Feyenoord youth product Kyle Ebecilio, who is back in his homeland with FC Twente after joining Arsenal in 2010, was made the sole director of a company called Quick Star Limited a few days after his son\u2019s 16th birthday, with a loan of \u00a340,000 paid into the company\u2019s account by his new agents.</p> <p>Similar companies exist for Manchester United\u2019s Timothy Fosu-Mensah (Mensah Services Limited) and Manchester City\u2019s Javairo Dilrosun (Dilroson Goals Limited) and Rodney Kongolo (Avon Vale Limited). Dilrosun and Kongolo were 15 at the time the companies were established. Although the establishment of the companies is permitted, Fifa rules state it is illegal for players to sign a contract with any agent until they turn 16. Again, there is no suggestion of rules having been breached. Stellar say it is still yet to be repaid the loan by Ebecilio\u2019s father.</p> <p>Barnett has also categorically denied any involvement with either Calleri or Rulli\u2019s moves to England. Signed by Boca Juniors at the start of 2014 from the second division side All Boys, was purchased by Maldonado for \u20ac12m in January 2016 despite interest from several European clubs, including Brighton and Internazionale. After his move to Maldonado, Calleri was almost immediately loaned out to S\u00e3o Paulo in the Campeonato Brasileiro, in which he scored nine goals in 12 games as S\u00e3o Paulo reached the semi-finals of the Libertadores. When asked by a fan on his last day of training where he was heading next, Calleri said: \u201cI wish I knew.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1859792-que-paso-con-la-transferencia-de-jonathan-calleri\" title=\"\">According to La Naci\u00f3n</a>, Calleri was brought to Maldonado\u2019s attention by Gustavo Arribas, who was employed as an adviser to the club until December last year and is now the head of Argentina\u2019s Federal Intelligence Agency.</p> <p>West Ham are understood to have paid a \u00a34m fee to secure Calleri on a season-long loan, with an option to buy him for around \u00a316m when that expires. The club insist there is no obligation to buy and they have not broken any rules.</p> <p>\u201cEverything has been sanctioned by Fifa and there is no question of any third-party ownership,\u201d a spokesman said.</p> <p>Rulli\u2019s situation is even more complicated. He broke into the first team at Estudiantes and was bought by Maldonado in 2014. Having spent last season on loan at Real Sociedad, the 24-year-old signed for City on 18 July in a permanent deal worth around \u00a34m. Less than three weeks later, Sociedad announced on their website that Rulli had joined on a permanent deal until 2022, although the move will not be completed until January. City are thought to have a buyback clause that enables them to repurchase him for \u00a311.6m (\u20ac14m) in each of the next three summer transfer windows.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c8bda6122c794a5d7408ec1ac4b2905545de3794\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c8bda6122c794a5d7408ec1ac4b2905545de3794/0_128_4914_3216/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ger\u00f3nimo Rulli in action for Real Sociedad.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"654\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ger\u00f3nimo Rulli in action for Real Sociedad.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Juan Manuel Serrano Arce/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThe deal was done directly with Maldonado,\u201d a City spokesman said. \u201cThere is no question of his economic rights being held by a third party.</p> <p>\u201cThis one is all completely above board. There have been times in the past when we have taken players out of third-party ownership but this genuinely isn\u2019t one. You\u2019ll find it in some places but you won\u2019t find it here.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m told that there is history with them (Maldonado) and third party owners but on this one we\u2019re confident that it isn\u2019t the case.\u201d</p> <p>Confused? You are not the only ones. One of the main controversies stemming from the<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/29/managers-demand-full-disclosure-football-corruption\" title=\"\"> Daily Telegraph\u2019s sting </a>on the former England manager Sam Allardyce centred on his comment about how easy it remains to circumvent Fifa\u2019s rules on TPO, having claimed to have achieved exactly that when West Ham signed Enner Valencia from the Mexican side Pachuca. The West Ham co-owner, David Sullivan, denied that was the case last week, stating Pachuca owned all of the Ecuadorian\u2019s economic rights when they bought him.</p> <p>\u201cSam is wrong but he didn\u2019t know much about the actual transfer deal other than wanting the player,\u201d Sullivan said. \u201cWe have not broken any rules on third party ownership.\u201d</p> <p>Russo said Fifa must close the loophole if they are serious about banning the practice which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/mar/16/michel-platini-defend-ban-third-party-ownership\" title=\"\">Michel Platini once branded \u201ca type of slavery\u201d</a>.</p> <p>\u201cI think that nothing has really changed. In my opinion, this is the same as the battle against doping,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen the authorities ban a substance, the scientists are two or three steps ahead. The same applies in third-party ownership: when Fifa introduces a new rule against this practice, the investors are always two or three steps in advance.\u201d</p>",

  "<h2>O CAPTAIN! MY CAPTAIN!</h2> <p>One game under the belt for Caretaker Gareth and things are looking up for England. Winning the first match under their new manager was decent enough. But the real challenge was whether he would exhibit the necessary self-control required to stay clear of celebrating Saturday\u2019s thumping 2-0 win over Malta by hiring a gold limousine to take him out for a big night in London\u2019s West End, during which he would unwittingly accept a lucrative offer to feature as a keynote speaker at the Pizza Hut Christmas party later this year, all while taking gulps from a pint of absinthe. It would all end with him saying he\u2019s never much cared for Mary Berry\u2019s recipes and that would be that; Phil Brown would have been England\u2019s manager by the end of the week. But no, none of that for Caretaker Gareth, which means he\u2019s already one up on his predecessor. After the debacle of Big Sam\u2019s grubby demise it\u2019s progress, enough for $exually Repressed Morris Dancing Fiver to proclaim England as favourites for the next World Cup if they maintain this rate of improvement.<br></p> <p>For all that Malta cowered as England squelched past them, Caretaker Gareth wasn\u2019t entirely pleased. While it initially seemed that he wasn\u2019t going to rock the boat, heightening the impression that he\u2019s too nice to succeed in the job, he\u2019s decided that it\u2019s time to steer it into some choppy waters, having come to the conclusion that the majority of England supporters reached a long time ago: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/10/wayne-rooney-gareth-southgate-england-slovenia-world-cup-2018-qualifier\">it seems he\u2019s about to drop Wazziesta</a> for Tuesday\u2019s World Cup qualifier in Slovenia. That\u2019s right. No more Mr Nice Caretaker Gareth. He\u2019s unveiled his mean streak and the first casualty is his wheezing, spluttering, red-faced captain, whose attempt to convert himself from a deadly striker to a midfield maestro looks more doomed than ever, with that trademark crossfield pass out to the right-back not enough to spare him from a place on the bench.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/10/wayne-rooney-gareth-southgate-england-slovenia-world-cup-2018-qualifier\">Wayne Rooney set to be dropped by Gareth Southgate for England qualifier</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Now we can drop the pretence that Wazziesta was any use during Euro 2016. While it\u2019s a brave move in some ways, it\u2019s an obvious one in so many others. It won\u2019t cure all of England\u2019s flaws, it is slightly reminiscent of Schecond\u2013Schoish Schteve\u2019s decision to omit David Beckham from his first squad after replacing $exy Sven and there is every chance that Wazziesta will be back in the side sooner rather than later, given how these episodes have played out in the past. Above all, however, it does show two things. Firstly Caretaker Gareth isn\u2019t overawed by fame, unlike, say the surprisingly timid Sam Allardyce. Secondly that he is the owner of a functioning pair of eyes, enabling him to spot that England would probably be better off with a lump of cheese instead of Wazziesta in midfield.

  "<p>Governments will address the law of unintended consequences when they meet this week to revise a global treaty and try to eliminate the use of a group of greenhouse gases used in fridges, inhalers and air conditioners.<br></p> <p>Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) were hailed as the answer to the hole in the ozone layer which appeared over Antarctica in the 1980s because they replaced hundreds of chemical substances widely used in aerosols which depleted the thin layer of ozone which protects the Earth from harmful rays of the sun. </p> <p>One hundred and ninety-seven countries signed the historic 1987 agreement which phased out chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and similar hydrochlorofluoro carbons (HCFCs) and has seen gradual closure of the two polar ozone holes. </p> <p>But concern has been mounting at how their substitute is undermining the landmark Paris climate agreement and could hamper attempts to keep global warming below dangerous levels.<br></p> <p>\u201cThe use of hydrofluorocarbons is growing. Already, the HFCs used in refrigerators, air conditioners, inhalers ... are emitting a gigaton of CO2-equivalent pollution into the atmosphere annually. If that sounds like a lot; it is. It\u2019s equivalent to the emissions from nearly 300 coal-fired power plants every single year,\u201d the US secretary of state, John Kerry, told <a href=\"http://www.climatechangenews.com/2016/07/22/john-kerry-hfcs-are-a-critical-piece-of-the-climate-puzzle/\">a UN meeting on the Montreal protocol </a> earlier this year.</p> <p>\u201cAn HFC phasedown amendment is a critical piece of the climate puzzle,\u201d he added.</p> <p>HFC use is increasing rapidly, driven by sales of fridges and air conditioning especially in fast-growing developing countries. </p> <p>Researchers at the <a href=\"http://eetd.lbl.gov/news/article/55587/berkeley-lab-study-shows-significant-potential-for-deployment-of-superefficient-a\">US government\u2019s Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory </a>have calculated that 700m air-conditioning units, all using HFCs, are likely to be installed worldwide by 2030 and 1.6bn by 2050, it says. </p> <p>The UN\u2019s climate change body, the IPCC, has projected that <a href=\"http://www.rehva.eu/publications-and-resources/rehva-journal/2015/042015/air-conditioning-environmental-challenges.html\">global air-conditioning energy demand will grow</a> 33-fold from 300 terawatt-hours (TWh) in 2000 to more than 10,000TWh in 2100, with most of the growth coming in developing economies.</p> <p>Countries meeting in Kigali, Rwanda, this week will be asked to approve an amendment to the Montreal protocol. This would cover HFCs and, over time, eliminate the manufacture of the chemicals and, potentially reduce global temperatures by an around 0.5C by 2100. </p> <p>A fast phasedown of the factory-made HFCs could avoid the equivalent of as much as 200bn tonnes of CO2<sub> </sub> by 2050, according <a href=\"http://www.igsd.org/fast-hfc-phase-down-could-avoid-200-billion-tonnes-of-co2-eq-by-2050/\">to a study published in Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics</a>.</p> <p>But negotiations will be tough. Rich countries want the chemicals phased out within 5-10 years, but developing countries led by China and India have argued for a date closer to 2031 which, they say, will give their chemical industries time to adapt. </p> <p>But because HFC alternatives, including natural refrigerants such as CO2, and hydrocarbons, already exist, there is no technical reason why HFC reductions cannot be achieved quickly and inexpensively, say scientists and environmentalists.</p> <p>G7 countries have committed to provide additional funding to help developing countries implement an HFC amendment and last month a group of philanthropists <a href=\"http://oneworld.org/2016/09/22/philanthropists-53m-fund-aims-to-aid-fight-against-climate-change/\">pledged $53m</a> to help.</p> <p>\u201cIt is in everyone\u2019s interests to phase out HFCs as soon as possible,\u201d said Gaby Drinkwater, Christian Aid\u2019s policy officer. \u201cAs people in developing countries seek more air conditioners and refrigerators, a heavy expansion of HFCs could deal a significant blow to the ambition of the Paris agreement and set back any progress made on keeping global warming to 2C.\u201d</p> <p>However, environmentalists with a long memory say that governments could have easily avoided the release of tens of billions of tons of HFC chemicals if they had listened to scientists in the 1980s. </p> <p>\u201cHFCs were always known to have the potential to increase global warming. We solved the ozone problem of ozone but governments chose not to address the climate-changing potential of their substitutes even though they knew about it,\u201d said Dr Robin Russell-Jones, former director of the skin tumour unit at the St John\u2019s Institute of Dermatology in London.</p> <p>\u201cIf it takes over a quarter of a century to fix a simple technological problem, then what chance is there for the world community to solve global warming?\u201d he added.</p> <p>In 1989, he wrote in one of Britain\u2019s leading medical journals, the Lancet: \u201cMost scientists want to see the Montreal protocol widened to include substitutes like HCFC22. If uncontrolled [they] will be adding 15% to the global warming effect of carbon dioxide by the year 2030.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Black communities in London are disproportionately more likely to breathe illegal levels of air pollution than white and Asian ones, new research seen exclusively by the Guardian shows.</p> <p>The study for the mayor of London shows black, African and Caribbean people account for 15.3% of all Londoners exposed to nitrogen dioxide (NO2) levels that breach EU limits, but they account for just 13.3% of the city\u2019s population.</p> <p>The proportion of white and Asian individuals exposed to the dangerous NO2 levels is lower than the fraction of the population they account for, said Aether, the consultancy which produced the report.<br></p> <p>Southwark, Lambeth and Hackney were among the boroughs with an overlap of both a higher proportion of black residents and the higher pollution levels.</p> <p>Previous research has shown there is a clear link between economically deprived areas and greater exposure to polluted air. But the new work, which comes as Sadiq Khan launches <a href=\"https://consultations.tfl.gov.uk/environment/air-quality-consultation-phase-2?cid=airquality-consultation\">a new consultation on charges to tackle London\u2019s polluted air</a>, is one of the first to suggest there is a related race dimension too. </p> <p>\u201cPeople living in places with high proportions of black, mixed or \u2018other\u2019 ethnic groups are more likely to be exposed to above EU NO2 limit value concentrations than those in areas with a high proportion of white people,\u201d said the Aether study. \u201cThis effect is not seen for areas with a high proportion of Asian groups.\u201d<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/oct/2016-10-10T13:31:08/embed.html\" data-alt=\"pollution graphic\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/oct/2016-10-10T13:31:08/embed.html\">pollution graphic</a> </figure>  <p>But because of the \u201cvery mixed ethnic geography of London\u201d, the pattern is less strong between ethnicity and exposure than the one between deprivation and exposure, Aether found. In areas with poor air quality, 32% of people living there were from the most deprived groups, versus 7% from the least deprived.</p> <p>\u201cThis research shows the disproportionate impact air pollution has on deprived communities in London,\u201d said Aether\u2019s director, Katie King.<br></p> <p>\u201cWe have known for some time now that poor families end up living in cheaper housing which is often in close proximity to busy roads,\u201d said a spokesman for the air quality unit at King\u2019s College London.</p> <p>However, he said the new study\u2019s use of proportionate data was misleading, as in absolute terms there are more Asian and white people exposed to high NO2 levels.<br></p> <p>Last month, the Black Lives Matter UK group linked ethnicity and environmental issues <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/06/black-lives-matter-protesters-occupy-london-city-airport-runway\">during a protest at London City airport</a> - although the protestors were also criticised for their largely white membership.</p> <p>The study compiled King\u2019s data on NO2 concentrations in 2013 \u2013 the most recent available \u2013 census results, official statistics on deprivation and ethnic profiles of small areas in London. In total, 1.9 million people in London were exposed to NO2 concentrations above the EU\u2019s annual average limit.<br></p> <p>The work is an update of a report which the former mayor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/may/16/boris-johnson-accused-of-burying-study-linking-pollution-and-deprived-schools\">Boris Johnson was accused of burying when Khan took office</a>. That earlier report showed 433 primary schools were exposed to NO2 above the limits in 2010, with that number falling to 360 by 2013 in today\u2019s study, showing some areas have got cleaner.</p> <p>Transport for London (TfL) published a consultation on Monday seeking Londoners\u2019 views on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/may/13/sadiq-khan-to-double-size-londons-clean-air-zone-pollution\">Khan\u2019s new measures to tackle the problem</a>. They include whether to introduce a \u00a310 emissions surcharge in October 2017, the so-called T-charge, which will mostly apply to pre-2005 diesel cars.</p> <p>Khan and TfL are also consulting on whether to bring in an enlarged \u201cultra low emissions zone\u201d (Ulez) in 2019 rather than 2020 as previously planned, charging owners of dirtier cars \u00a312.50 to enter. Both charges will be in addition to the existing \u00a311.50 congestion charge.</p> <p>\u201cToxic air in London is a health emergency that requires bold action, including introducing charges for older polluting vehicles and expanding the Ulez,\u201d said Khan.</p> <p>Environmental groups and thinktanks welcomed the proposals, but Friends of the Earth said the mayor needed to go further.</p> <p>\u201cTo bring down London\u2019s air pollution as quickly as possible, Sadiq Khan must extend the Ulez for all vehicles across the whole of London; and create a plan for phasing out diesel on London\u2019s roads altogether,\u201d said Sophie Neuburg, a campaigner at the green group.</p> <p>Next week the government faces a court case brought by environmental law firm ClientEarth over what it says is an inadequate plan to reduce NO2 pollution.</p> <p>\u201cToday\u2019s announcement sends a clear message to the government that it needs to get a grip with this public health crisis. This is a national problem that needs a national solution. That is why we are taking them back to court next week,\u201d said Alan Andrews, a ClientEarth lawyer.</p>",
  "<p>It was the dog, or fox, that didn\u2019t bark.

  "<p>We all know what an \u201calpha male\u201d is. An alpha male is a man who takes charge, one who imposes his will on others, not the other way round. Other men want to be him, women want to be with him. An alpha male intimidates, he\u2019s unquestionably in charge, no matter what the situation. An alpha male is loud, brash, doesn\u2019t care what anybody else thinks. An alpha male says what he wants, does what he wants, wears what he wants, as long as those clothes are roomy enough in the trousers to accommodate his gargantuan gonads and don\u2019t dissolve in response to all the testosterone constantly leaking from his pores. </p> <p>That\u2019s the general idea, anyway. But the idea that human men can be alpha males is actually far from scientifically accepted. This may come as a surprise, given how common and widespread the notion is. The most recent example would be Donald Trump in his presidential debates. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/09/alpha-males-run-politics-donald-trump-misogyny\">People have labelled him an alpha male</a>, Nigel Farage even defended Trump\u2019s obscene comments about women as \u201c<a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-37601422\">alpha male boasting</a>\u201d and compared him to a silverback gorilla, which for those familiar with primate anatomy is <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://twitter.com/Nick_Pettigrew/status/785354647687032832\">actually quite an insult</a>. So what, scientifically, is the case for alpha males among humans?

Species like chimps and gorillas do have social structures and hierarchies with a dominant individual at the top, typically a male who has achieved that positon via displays of strength and physical prowess. The fact that alpha males exist isn\u2019t disputed, it\u2019s whether humans can actually be such a thing.</p> <p>The term started being applied to humans with the publication of Frans de Waal\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Chimpanzee-Politics-Power-among-Apes/dp/0801886562\">Chimpanzee Politics</a>, which made direct comparisons between human and chimp behaviour, including the dominant behaviour of males. It became more mainstream when used in <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1999/11/05/us/naomi-wolf-feminist-consultant-to-gore-clarifies-her-campaign-role.html?_r=0\">the context of Al Gore\u2019s presidential campaign</a>. </p> <p>It really became accepted as something men <em>should want to be</em> with the success of Neil Strauss\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Game-Undercover-Secret-Society-Artists/dp/184767237X\">The Game</a>, based on lessons he acquired from the Pick Up Artist community. This should trigger alarm bells for many; <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/brain-flapping/2014/nov/14/how-to-be-a-pickup-artist-science-dapper-laughs-julien-blanc\">terms and methods acquired from Pick Up Artists should be treated with extreme scepticism at the very least</a>. But, sex being the powerful motivator that it is, the idea that being an alpha male would improve your life and make you more successful with women proved incredibly beguiling, so acceptance and use of the term has now become the norm. But this doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s valid, just that it\u2019s common.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"46c78541a9179e3e103ccbe238cb57aedec70dfc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/46c78541a9179e3e103ccbe238cb57aedec70dfc/0_71_2121_1273/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mature couple having relationship difficultiesAnnoyed woman with her husband standing in background at home.

Why that happens is another matter.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alvarez/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>The case for the human alpha male</strong></h2> <p>One reason that, despite a lack of concrete evidence, the idea of the human alpha male is so persuasive is that is makes a great deal of intuitive sense. The big, loud, brash guys who swagger and dominate and bully have been part of our society for as long as it\u2019s existed, so it\u2019s nice to have a convenient label for them if nothing else. </p> <p>It\u2019s hard to deny that humans are very susceptible to <a href=\"http://intergroup.uconn.edu/socialdominance.html\">the process of social dominance</a>; we exist in unequal hierarchies with inferior and superior individuals in almost every context, so it\u2019s not far-fetched to assume that some men rise to the top of these hierarchies due to a combination of physical and psychological qualities (such as <a href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/head-games/201412/are-alpha-males-myth-or-reality\">height, a deep voice, and so on</a>).</p> <p>Humans are, for better or worse, very easily influenced by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/brain-flapping/2015/apr/02/democracy-psychology-idiots-election\">displays of confidence, after all</a>. And by acting confident, men could well find they get their way more often, and thus be compelled to continue. A self-fulfilling prophecy that suggests \u201cfake it \u2018til you make it\u201d is a valid approach to \u201cbecoming\u201d an alpha male, and therefore propagate the idea. After all, women <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/brain-flapping/2016/may/12/science-hasnt-proved-that-women-go-for-bad-boys\">love a bad boy (maybe)</a>. </p> <p>Overall, human behaviour has many aspects that, taken together, suggest that alpha males are a real thing.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b10722d2d0f453373228badea11d9be17bd397ff\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b10722d2d0f453373228badea11d9be17bd397ff/0_0_3500_2099/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Contestants flex their muscles on stage during the first round of the men\u2019s bodybuilding 85-kg category at the Asian and World Bodybuilding and Physique Sport Championships in Bangkok on October 7, 2011.

Because while human do share a number of features and behaviours with our primate cousins, we are invariably far more complex. </p> <p>People can belong to different hierarchies, for example; a guy who is the most vocal, dominant person in his amateur football team might be under the heel of an aggressive boss during his day job. Is he an alpha male, or not? It depends on context, obviously. Humans have many different social groups and varying roles within them, because we\u2019re more complex. A universal \u201calpha\u201d seems unlikely. </p> <p>Rather than relying on aggressive dominance, humans are actually far more cooperative and social. Some evidence suggests that our <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19575315\">friendliness and sociability is what made us so smart to begin with</a>, so rather than being the top humans, you could argue that alpha males are something of an evolutionary throwback, the civilizational equivalent of an appendix; no longer used, just hangs around and occasionally <a href=\"http://www.everydayhealth.com/appendicitis/guide/appendix/ruptured/\">fills everything with poison</a>. </p> <p>Supposed human alpha male behaviour also often doesn\u2019t match alpha male behaviour in other species. Many non-human alpha males also have a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_(ethology)\">corresponding alpha female</a> who exerts similar levels of dominance and control, whereas human alpha males invariably have a \u201cless respectful\u201d attitude towards women, shall we say. Also, the fact that many communities of men (particularly online) are seemingly convinced that they can all be alpha males is a contradiction in terms; there should only be one alpha male per community, that\u2019s sort of the whole point. The rest should try and depose him as and when the opportunity presents itself, but until then they are, at best, \u201cbeta males\u201d, a term often used as an insult by members of said community with no sense of irony. </p> <p>It\u2019s as if the idea of being an alpha male is very reassuring to those who lack confidence and are scared by the wider world and people in it, so want to turn the tables.</p> <p>This may be key. Supposed alpha males may always get their way not because of to some evolved tendency in humans to respect and obey men who display a specific set of characteristics, as if people were video games that respond to certain cheat codes, but simply because they\u2019re scary. If a large, shouty man starts bellowing in your face, that\u2019s very unsettling, so people may do what he says to stop him from becoming violent, or just to make him go away. Said man would obviously perceive this as evidence for his own superiority.</p> <p>Maybe the supposed human alpha male is a combination of disgruntled male wish fulfilment and borderline-pseudoscientific justification for resorting to bullying, intimidation and generally all-round unpleasant behaviour by men hoping to impose their will on a world they find too complex and unnerving so revert to their baser instincts to get what they want, despite knowing deep down they don\u2019t deserve it and shouldn\u2019t have it?</p> <p>In fairness, \u201calpha male\u201d is a lot more succinct. </p> <p><em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/garwboy\">Dean Burnett</a>\u2019s debut book</em><em> </em><em><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Idiot-Brain-Neuroscientist-Explains-Really/dp/1783350814/ref=sr_1_1_twi_pap_2?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1461961162&amp;sr=1-1\">The Idiot Brain</a></em><em> </em><em>is available now in</em><em> </em><em><a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/370462/s/idiot-brain/\">the UK</a>,</em><em> </em><em><a href=\"http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/idiot-brain-dean-burnett/1122688091?ean=9780393253788#productInfoTabs\">USA</a></em><em> </em><em>and <a href=\"http://www.harpercollins.ca/9781443450065/the-idiot-brain\">Canada</a>.</em></p>",
  "<p>So it turns out that Alicia Keys, whose comeback has been based around the concept of being makeup-free, isn\u2019t quite as untouched as she claims to be. Last week, in an interview with <a href=\"http://www.wmagazine.com/story/alicia-keys-no-makeup-glowing-complexion-secrets\">W magazine</a>, her makeup artist Dotti revealed that Keys wears brow definer, self-tanning anti-ageing serum and mattifier that total more than \u00a3300.

It\u2019s an egregiously average, sweeping epic drama in the tradition of Braveheart or Spartacus, that is both predictable (Strange Fruit plays while black bodies are swinging from trees; Swing Low, Sweet Chariot underscores the wide shot of a cotton field; a little white girl skips playfully as she leads a little black girl by a rope tied to her neck) and devoid of character development, particularly among the women, who are all one-dimensional (Turner\u2019s beloved nana gives a big speech about pride and heritage and then promptly dies), in direct service of their menfolk, and have about 50 lines between them throughout the two-hour film. </p> <p>About three-quarters of the way through the screening at a nearly empty theatre in Brooklyn, a young black woman leaned across the open seat between us and whispered as she pointed at the screen: \u201cYou think that one with the blood on his shirt is the brother who did time?\u201d I whispered back that I didn\u2019t think Jean Celestin had a role in the film, but that he was credited as co-writer of the movie\u2019s screenplay. She nodded her head, and seemed a little disappointed as she sunk back into her seat \u2013 like she\u2019d sat through one whole hour and 45 minutes of this movie waiting for something interesting to happen, and then she couldn\u2019t even get that out of it.</p> <p>I wasn\u2019t necessarily looking for anything especially interesting to happen, although I was open to being pleasantly surprised \u2013 the potential was certainly there. Mostly, I was unmoved by the film. I left the theater thinking not about who we were during pre-civil war slavery, but rather who are not in post-civil war slavery, when black people are profiled and policed and killed and incarcerated for no reason other than being black. The character of Turner\u2019s wife, Cherry, played by Aja Naomi King, says virtually the same thing after Nat\u2019s rebellion has failed and black people all across the county are being arbitrarily hanged as punishment.</p> <p>Slavery has evolved in modern America, but we black Americans have evolved, too. We don\u2019t need to kill white people to get free. We need to kill slavery and the systemic racism that preserves its legacy by continuing to hold up our humanity in a country with a history of not seeing us as human. </p>",
  "<p>Controversial surveillance technology that indiscriminately harvests information from mobile phones is being used by at least seven police forces across the country, a far larger number than previously known, according to police documents.</p> <p>The hardware, known as an IMSI catcher, tricks mobile phone handsets across an area of several miles into connecting to them by impersonating cellphone towers, and can be used to pinpoint phone owners\u2019 locations or intercept phone calls and text messages. </p> <p>The Metropolitan police were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/oct/30/metropolitan-police-mobile-phone-surveillance\">previously known to have purchased</a> IMSI (international mobile subscriber identity) technology. However, <a href=\"https://thebristolcable.org/2016/10/imsi/\">documents obtained</a> by the Bristol Cable, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/jan/24/bristol-cable-newspaper-public-interest-journalism\">a citizen\u2019s media cooperative</a>, indicate that at least six other police forces have bought the same hardware, also referred to as CCDC (covert communications data capture).</p> <p>Police refuse to acknowledge their acquisition of this technology or discuss how they use it, claiming that any disclosures could assist criminals and terrorists. As well as the Met, other forces understood to be using it include West Mercia, Warwickshire, West Midlands, Staffordshire, Avon and Somerset, and South Yorkshire.<br></p> <p>Matthew Rice, an advocacy officer at the campaign group <a href=\"https://www.privacyinternational.org/\">Privacy International</a>, said: \u201cIMSI catchers, by their very nature, operate indiscriminately, gathering information from all individuals in the particular operating area. This collateral intrusion into the private lives of many innocent individuals is deeply concerning in any context let alone one that is, almost deliberately, opaque.\u201d <br></p> <p>Civil liberties campaigners have criticised the lack of accountability surrounding IMSI catcher use by police. Rice said the continued secrecy \u201cshuts down debate in the worst way. Policing by consent requires that these evolving techniques be discussed openly and robustly in society, otherwise there is no way of giving true and informed consent\u201d. <br></p> <p>The technology works by exploiting the fact that mobile phones constantly seek the strongest possible signal in order to make and receive calls and data. IMSI catchers present themselves as the strongest signal in the area, prompting all nearby mobile phones to connect to them. </p> <p>The technology then routes the signal to a normal mobile mast, allowing the phones to continue to function, albeit with all the data potentially being scrutinised by whoever is controlling the IMSI catcher.</p> <p>The use of the controversial hardware emerged after the Bristol Cable noticed that South Yorkshire police\u2019s budget had allocated \u00a3144,000 for \u201cIMSI covert communications\u201d in 2014 and \u201cCCDC\u201d in the same document. </p> <p>When asked, a press officer for the force said they were the same item, but refused to disclose any further information for operational reasons. </p> <p>A Metropolitan police transparency document listing all contracts with suppliers agreed between October and December 2015 shows \u00a31,037,223 allocated for \u201cCCDC\u201d to telecommunications firm Cellxion. A similar document for Avon and Somerset police shows a \u00a3169,575 payment to the same company for \u201cCCDC equipment\u201d. </p> <p>Marketing documents published by Privacy International show Cellxion has previously touted an IMSI catcher as \u201ca comprehensive set of tools to combat the growing use of mobile phone communications technology in crime and terrorism\u201d. </p> <p>Meanwhile, the minutes of a meeting between the police and crime commissioners of West Mercia and Warwickshire police reveal their approval of a plan to purchase a replacement for their current CCDC deployment, in part on the grounds that neighbouring forces were also using the technology.</p> <p>\u201cWithin the West Midlands region both West Midlands and Staffordshire police have recently purchased and operated 4G-compatible CCDC equipment,\u201d the minutes state. </p> <p>\u201cThe purchase [of replacement CCDC units for West Mercia and Warwickshire forces] would allow the use of the equipment in support of regional operation, but more frequently in support of local high-risk investigations, reducing the impact of demand across the region for the same equipment being used in West Midlands and Staffordshire.\u201d</p> <p>The West Mercia police and crime commissioner, John Campion, said: \u201cI have seen real-life examples of the difference this technology can make in protecting extremely vulnerable people in our society. It is absolutely appropriate that the police can make use of this technology in order to keep people safe.</p> <p>\u201cIt is very important to me that civil liberties are upheld and respected. I am reassured on behalf of our local communities that the safeguards and processes in place will ensure this technology will be used appropriately and proportionately.\u201d</p> <p>Matthew Ellis, the police and crime commissioner for Staffordshire, said: \u201cIt is right that police have the tools to tackle the complex nature of crime in the 21st century. Some tactics police use to keep people safe and bring criminals to justice can be intrusive and it is crucial that there are robust safeguards, framed by legislation, around this work, and there are.\u201d</p> <p>A spokesperson for the Metropolitan police said they \u201ccannot comment on any specific surveillance methods or technology deployed to ensure the safety and security of Londoners. We will only use any surveillance methods or technology within the parameters of the legislation and associated governance and oversight regimes.\u201d</p> <p>The Warwickshire police and West Mercia police temporary assistant chief constable, Stephen Cullen, said: \u201cOur main priority is to protect the public from harm and we achieve this by utilising a number of techniques, some of them covert in nature. To retain their effectiveness we are not able to openly discuss these methods.\u201d</p>",

It\u2019s the day after the Washington Post publishes <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/07/donald-trump-leaked-recording-women\">a video of Donald Trump bragging that his fame enables him to sexually abuse women</a>, a vision of masculinity so revolting it makes male heterosexuality seem like a thought disorder. </p> <p>Clearly, we have never been in more need of Mac\u2019s \u201cradical faerie realness ritual\u201d which, in 246 songs and 24 hours, will replace the sick, straight America we know and loathe with a deeply queer one in which outcasts and outsiders are recognized and venerated as visionaries responsible for creating the country\u2019s culture.

A singer, playwright, ringmaster, actor and provocateur, Mac is carrying the show, his formidable panoply of talents on constant display as he takes us chronologically through American history in songs from Amazing Grace to his final, self-penned number 24 hours later. \u201cIt\u2019s about us in this room,\u201d Mac tells us at some point on Sunday morning. \u201cWe have a lot of history on our backs and we have to figure out what to do with it.\u201d</p> <p>Decked out in a succession of eye-popping and era-riffing costumes by <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/23265334\">Machine Dazzle</a>, including a giant beer barrel appliqued with lips and snakes for the section set in Puritan times and devoted to drinking songs, Mac is in the spotlight for the whole damn thing, the band playing on the rare occasions when he dashes to the bathroom. Just memorizing the songs is a feat in itself, while Mac\u2019s stamina is awe-inspiring. There\u2019s a very moving moment when his superb musical director and pianist, <a href=\"http://songsfortheanonymous.com/\">Matt Ray</a>, gets up to leave the stage after playing for 23 solid hours. After delivering a version of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3_dOWYHS7I\">Lauryn Hill\u2019s Everything is Everything</a> which comes close to summing up the night, he clutches Mac and helplessly bursts into tears. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8f89bcfc44b32489543f5397a162b9bfe89b877d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8f89bcfc44b32489543f5397a162b9bfe89b877d/0_0_3968_1993/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Taylor Mac takes the audience through Okie from Muskogee at New York\u2019s Joe\u2019s Pub in an earlier version of the show.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"502\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Taylor Mac takes the audience through Okie from Muskogee at New York\u2019s Joe\u2019s Pub in an earlier version of the show.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kevin Yatarola</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The fact that despite its enormous length, the quality of this epic piece barely flags speaks to years of painstaking research and craft. With coruscating wit and ingenuity, Mac brings his vision alive roughly a decade at a time. He\u2019s supported by a 24-piece orchestra whittled down hour by hour, a posse of \u201cdandy minions\u201d who intercede between Mac and the audience, and a formidably talented collection of supporting performers, including the rarely clothed <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/15/fashion/boylesque-a-male-spin-on-the-classic-striptease.html?_r=0\">James \u201cTigger!\u201d Ferguson</a>, whose naked prison sex scene ensures that <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iDcvmrHV9Jc\">Connie Francis\u2019s Where the Boys Are</a> will never be heard quite the same way again. Meanwhile, you haven\u2019t lived until you\u2019ve seen <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcSlcNfThUA\">Tiptoe Through the Tulips</a> performed by a crowd of mini-<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/nov/01/the-night-i-put-leigh-bowery-on-the-catwalk-iain-r-webb\">Leigh Bowerys</a> playing the ukulele. Given that Mac can even turn a song like <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVqoc_GOH-0\">Soliloquy from Rodgers and Hammerstein\u2019s Carousel </a>into something as strange and alluring as glam-era David Bowie, it\u2019s baffling that his work isn\u2019t more widely known.</p> <p>Starting with an offering of the same instrument to the Native American performer Timothy White Eagle (in a \u201ctoken Indian\u201d T-shirt), the show journeys through scenes including the trenches of the first world war, a version of the Mikado set in space (in order to shear it of its cultural appropriation \u2013 this is an avowedly intersectional show), and a 70s gay sex party during which a 20-foot inflatable penis emblazoned with the stars and stripes is unleashed on the venue as Mac sings David Bowie\u2019s Heroes. </p> <p>Like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/apr/30/walt-whitman-revealed-as-author-of-manly-health-guide\">Walt Whitman in Song of Myself</a>, the show contains multitudes \u2013 and indeed the omnivorous and queer Whitman is one of the work\u2019s guiding spirits. In act three we get a wrestling smackdown for the title of father of American popular song between Whitman and <a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/foster/\">Stephen Foster</a>, writer of songs including Camptown Races, which Mac, correcting history, ensures that Whitman wins. Mac plays the poet; a game audience member sitting in a wrestling ring represents Foster.

Midway through act two, half the chairs in the venue are taken away, and then we\u2019re blindfolded, ordered to play musical chairs to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oG6GInWWmYg\">Meet Me by the Moonlight</a> and feed each other grapes. The atmosphere of barely controlled hysteria is intoxicating \u2013 like being at a great party where you\u2019ve no idea what will happen next \u2013 and, truly, the first six hours fly by. It\u2019s only when food is served to celebrate <a href=\"http://www.history.com/topics/american-civil-war/reconstruction\">Reconstruction</a> after a mass audience recreation of the American civil war battlefield using ping-pong balls that the time of night \u2013 and exactly how much stamina will be required for the hours ahead\u2013 dawns on you. </p> <p>For those who are flagging, there are hammocks in the theatre\u2019s garden and a 50-person bed set up on a balcony overlooking the stage, where your reviewer slumbered through the 1940s. I was awoken an hour later, at about 5am, by a loud rendition of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PLq0_7k1jk\">Roy Orbison\u2019s Oh, Pretty Woman</a> accompanied by a phalanx of strippers evoking the \u201cdirty glamour\u201d of the 50s, and stayed awake, fuelled by nothing more than coffee. Though the performer is the opposite of censorious (his impassioned riff on the radical power of anonymous gay sex would give <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/pauldacre\">Paul Dacre </a>a heart attack), Mac had words for those who might be tempted to stay awake with something stronger: \u201cI like performing for conscious people. Save your drugs, invite me over and I\u2019ll do them with you next week.\u201d </p> <p>Even without any substances, staying up for such a long time has a strange effect on one\u2019s state of mind. I\u2019ve never had strong feelings about You Keep Me Hanging On by the Supremes, but Mac\u2019s version, sung by an imaginary bus of gay people going to support the civil rights movement\u2019s 1963 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/aug/24/march-on-washington-anniversary-martin-luther-king\">March on Washington</a>, brings sudden tears to my eyes; even more overwhelming is Mac\u2019s take on Goodbye Yellow Brick Road, in which four audience members bear another aloft on their shoulders, symbolizing Judy Garland\u2019s funeral, which legend holds was one of the elements that sparked the Stonewall riots.</p> <p>At 7am, the <a href=\"http://bkunitedmb.com/\">Brooklyn United Marching Band</a>, a troupe of black boys in pink caps, file on to the stage and batter the hell out of their drums to provide a seismic conclusion to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z66wVo7uNw\">Move on Up</a>, Curtis Mayfield\u2019s anthem of African American pride and self-determination, as Mac sashays in see-through vinyl, a psychedelic CND symbol on his back. This combination of sound, spectacle and a spirit of joyful activism against injustice is so powerful it all but tears the roof off, and as the audience roars for what seems like about five minutes, Mac laughs: \u201cWe still have five hours.\u201d </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"85d1af3610674dd6757bdb1357cd20352f6141d7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/85d1af3610674dd6757bdb1357cd20352f6141d7/0_0_3823_5455/701.jpg\" alt=\"Mac with his musical director, Matt Ray, who bursts into tears after performing 23 hours straight.\" width=\"701\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mac with his musical director, Matt Ray, who bursts into tears after performing 23 hours straight.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ves Pitts</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The audience falls about. It feels inconceivable that we can last that long, but there are two elements that make the final strait work. First, the songs are more familiar: in quick succession we get Purple Rain (\u201cthe ultimate make-out song\u201d), Bruce Springsteen\u2019s Born to Run and an astonishing mash-up of Led Zeppelin\u2019s Kashmir and the Bee Gees\u2019 Stayin\u2019 Alive, which incorporates a long section in which Mac makes out with Machine Dazzle, dressed in chaps with a whip sticking out of his naked backside a la <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/mar/09/robert-mapplethorpe-photography-jack-fritscher-look-at-the-pictures\">Robert Mapplethorpe</a>. (\u201cThey tried to tell you [gays are] all like Ellen \u2013 no, we\u2019re kinky motherfuckers,\u201d Mac had informed the audience several hours before.)</p> <p>Second, the work seems to become even more personal. After playing <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Croz1_USr3U\">Tori Amos\u2019s Precious Things</a> so intensely that the audience is too stunned to applaud, Mac talks about his own background. Never having met any out gay people, he says, his first encounter with his community came at an event in 1987 staged by Aids activists. Witnessing their rage and grief at the deaths of their loved ones, but also the way the disease rallied them, Mac saw how \u201ca community was being built as it was falling apart\u201d. And pop music, he says, has the same alchemical quality \u2013 something intended to be ephemeral which instead becomes monumental. Suddenly we see the point of the show and its huge length \u2013 that in coming together as we\u2019re under duress, the audience and performers form a community. Certainly it\u2019s hard not to feel kinship with everyone who\u2019s gone through this extraordinary experience, or to feel profound admiration \u2013 even love \u2013 for its creators. </p> <p> \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve been this hoarse before in my whole life,\u201d Mac ponders as the finishing line appears on the horizon. \u201cI wonder why?\u201d The show concludes with Mac alone on the stage, playing the ukelele, at the end of an hour of his own excellent songs. One almost unbearably moving song deals with the massacre at the Pulse gay club in Orlando; another Lou Reed-tinged tune asks with a wink: \u201cHow will you miss me if I never go?\u201d before the lights go up and the company take an ovation which, after 24 hours, must be one of the most hard-earned in theatrical history. </p> <p>Rather than he or she, Mac\u2019s preferred pronoun is judy \u2013 \u201cI wanted to choose a gender pronoun that would emasculate you \u2013 you can\u2019t roll your eyes at judy without being camp,\u201d Mac explains during the marathon. However: \u201cMy gender is performer.\u201d No one watching Mac give everything to this astonishing show could argue that \u201cperformer\u201d is an identity to which judy has a right above all others. </p>",
  "<p>A single day of fighting in June 1859, among the vineyards and villages near Lake Garda, left 40,000 Italian, French and Austrian soldiers dead or wounded. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Solferino\">The Battle of Solferino</a> might have been remembered simply for its carnage, but for the presence of Henry Dunant. Dunant, a Swiss traveller, spent days tending the wounded and wrote a memoir that <a href=\"http://www.redcross.org.uk/About-us/Who-we-are/Museum-and-archives/Historical-factsheets/The-Battle-of-Solferino\">led to the founding of the Red Cross and to the first Geneva convention</a>, signed by Europe\u2019s great powers in 1864.</p> <p>Solferino inspired the principle that hospitals and army medical personnel are not a legitimate target in war. Today, with the bombing of hospitals by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/25/russia-accused-war-crimes-syria-un-security-council-aleppo\">Russians in Syria</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/15/saudi-led-air-strike-yemen-hospital-kills-at-least-seven\">Saudis in Yemen</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/03/msf-hospital-us-condemned-over-horrific-bombing-in-afghanistan\">Americans in Afghanistan</a>, those who provide medical aid in war believe that principle is in ruins.</p> <p>So far this year,<strong> </strong>according to M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF), 21 of their supported medical facilities in Yemen and Syria have been attacked. Last year an MSF hospital in Kunduz, Afghanistan was destroyed by a US attack, in which <a href=\"http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/article/msf-releases-internal-review-kunduz-hospital-attack\">those fleeing the building were reportedly gunned down from the air</a>, and 42 patients and staff died.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.un.org/press/en/2016/sc12347.doc.htm\">A UN resolution in May</a> urged combatants to refrain from bombing medical facilities. MSF says that the resolution \u201chas made no difference on the ground\u201d. Four out of the five permanent members of the UN security council, it says, are actively involved in coalitions whose troops have attacked hospitals.</p> <p>To understand the renewed popularity of killing sick people in hospital beds, it\u2019s not enough to point \u2013 as MSF does \u2013 to the new techniques of war, such as drones and special forces. Something has been eroded about our perception of humanitarian principles.</p> <p>The Red Cross was, at its inception, both a global humanitarian movement and an alliance of national, military-aligned volunteer units. The two did not seem contradictory. As long as a nation\u2019s army\u2019s hospitals obeyed the Geneva strictures \u2013 separating themselves from defensive military positions \u2013 civilian medics could volunteer on the understanding they would not be deliberately harmed.</p> <p>That could not be further from the ideological framework under which modern wars are fought. Since the Rwandan and Bosnian genocides, and with the fragmentation of numerous states along religious or ethnic lines, the essential story of modern conflict has become \u201cwe, the normal folk, against an inhuman, alien and irrational foe\u201d.</p> <p>Though this meme was there in the wars of the Solferino era, it was also tempered by the desire to establish international law, and by the existence of labour movements capable of issuing cross-border appeals for \u201cpeace between brothers\u201d \u2013 as both the French and Germans did during the Franco-Prussian war.</p> <p>Once you understand that the enemy soldier lying on the operating table is someone\u2019s son, and that your own son might be lying on the same kind of table across the lines, there is a logic to the principles of the Geneva conventions. But it is currently being trashed. If you want to point the finger, you could start with George W Bush. His administration\u2019s refusal to treat al-Qaida detainees in Afghanistan as combatants, and its institutional tolerance of torture, sexual violence and extra-judicial killing set a baseline for the crimes currently being perpetrated by Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Russia and the Syrian regime.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://collateralmurder.wikileaks.org\">\u201ccollateral murder\u201d video</a>, among evidence alleged to have been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/27/chelsea-manning-six-years-prison-whistleblowing\">released by Chelsea Manning</a>, showed a US Apache helicopter obliterating an ambulance in Baghdad as it collected the wounded. This was done by sticking to the US military\u2019s rules of engagement, not breaking them.<br></p> <p>Since Iraq, state-sanctioned barbarity has of course been ruthlessly mirrored and bettered by the war criminals of Isis, for whom the Geneva conventions\u2019 prohibitions read like a to-do list.</p> <p>But there\u2019s something deeper at work, eroding in our attitudes to mercy. The men and women Dunant inspired had a horror of war born of their experience of it: the more total it became, the more interest the population had in moderating military behaviour.</p> <p>Modern media coverage sanitises war. Broadcasting rules in the UK, for example, place strict limits on showing death, mutilated bodies and the agony of wounded people \u2013 all the things that inspired Dunant to change the world.</p> <p>Our grandfathers\u2019 generation were surprised and shocked by the ways in which the Nazis broke the Geneva conventions. We have come to expect they will be broken in all wars.</p> <p>Though the US has apologised for the Kunduz attack, and disciplined 12 people in the military for the errors that caused it, initial coverage in the US media actually <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2015/10/05/the-radically-changing-story-of-the-u-s-airstrike-on-afghan-hospital-from-mistake-to-justification/ \">justified the attack on the hospital</a> because it was said to be treating al-Qaida fighters.</p> <p> Now, as the Russian airstrikes against hospitals in rebel-held areas of Syria reach a crescendo, there is a campaign of justification centred around the accusation that the Syrian White Helmets \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/05/the-guardian-view-on-the-nobel-peace-prize-give-it-to-syrias-white-helmets\">a medical relief group funded by both the US and EU</a> \u2013 is \u201cnot neutral\u201d. Regardless of the White Helmets\u2019 funding by western powers, the issue of its neutrality is secondary to the fact that it is a medical organisation. It runs ambulances rescue services \u2013 and both are entitled to protection under the Geneva conventions, just as a British military hospital would be.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2016/oct/03/the-white-helmets-leader-we-can-anticipate-the-scale-of-destruction-based-on-the-sound-of-the-plane\">The White Helmets leader: \u2018We can anticipate the scale of destruction based on the sound of the plane\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The danger should be obvious.

Guernica showed a generation what the second world war would be like; Aleppo shows you what any future conventional conflict will descend to, if we don\u2019t act.<br></p> <p>Marine Buissonniere, MSF\u2019s senior co-ordinator, believes that, at the bare minimum, the UN secretary general needs to appoint a special representative mandated to investigate military attacks on hospitals.</p> <p>But we need more than words around the UN table. We need a movement from below, such as the one that created the Red Cross, and which built MSF in the 1970s.</p> <p>We need to understand \u2013 as the pioneering trauma medics of the 19th century understood \u2013 that if you tolerate inhumanity in war elsewhere, it can easily arrive on your own doorstep. </p>",

  "<p>What kind of value judgments and viewing habits do we bring to the theatre when we are watching a new piece of dance? It\u2019s a question posed by <a href=\"http://www.danceumbrella.co.uk/\">Dance Umbrella</a> and <a href=\"http://ballet-de-lorraine.eu/en\">CCN-Ballet de Lorraine</a> in their new, joint production, Unknown Pleasures. By presenting an evening of five new works, whose choreography, design, lighting and music all remain anonymous, they are inviting audiences to look at the stage with their senses rinsed clean of all preconceptions \u2013 and all <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/marketingandpr\">PR</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/oct/03/unknown-pleasures-art-anonymous-dance-umbrella-royal-court\">Unknown pleasures: do we enjoy art more if it's anonymous?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It\u2019s a bold and engaging experiment, challenging the roles that reputation, context, gender and age play in our evaluation of dance. But much as I enjoyed the novelty of the concept (and the freedom of arriving at the theatre without making any advance preparation), I didn\u2019t find that the experience made me a more innocent viewer.</p> <p>The five works in Unknown Pleasures are presented as one, near seamless performance, but with the first item divided into short sections that function as hinges between the four longer pieces. The movement in Anonymous #1 (my title) is a study in fragmented, frozen gesture and its dancers have a slightly lost air, as if unsure whether or not they are actively performing. They drift across the space, they place themselves precariously on the front edge of the stage, as if hoping to merge themselves with the audience. And while #1 adds a smart sliver of the conceptual to the programme, as a framing device it is perhaps too distancing, too self-conscious, for a show already fraught with questions.</p> <p>The other works are admirably diverse in style. Best of the four is #2, a pure minimalist piece for 17 dancers whose elegantly repeating walks, turns and glides accumulate into grids, circles, and progressively mesmeric kaleidoscopic patterns. These patterns form and reform with such tantalising rapidity that we cannot see whether the letters printed on the dancers\u2019 T-shirts are meant to make any sense; only at the end do the cast order themselves into a line in which the words \u201cThe world is burning but I keep on turning\u201d become clearly legible. The drollery of it, combined with the musicality of the phrasing and the exquisite control of structure, all suggest the imprint of <a href=\"http://www.lucindachilds.com/\">Lucinda Childs</a> \u2013 if not the choreographer herself then a talented disciple.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b8364b3314f7bb7860ffd2d3b7b474ce07631021\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b8364b3314f7bb7860ffd2d3b7b474ce07631021/0_414_4831_2898/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Unknown Pleasures by Dance Umbrella and CCN \u2013 Ballet de Lorraine.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Unknown Pleasures by Dance Umbrella and CCN \u2013 Ballet de Lorraine.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Piece #3 is about three couples, who seem to be locked together in a language of gluey, febrile body contact. At moments they break apart, as one or other dancer makes a swerving break for freedom, yet some dark force of emotional gravity keeps dragging them back to the confines of the duet. I suspect that if this work were longer and revealed more about each couple I might have rated it more highly. At 15 minutes, however, it doesn\u2019t transcend the very generic nature of its ingredients \u2013 the dysfunctional-looking relationships, the moody lighting and electronic score.</p> <p>The dance clock is turned back a couple of decades in #4, where dancers in retro-gold Lycra and black tights perform choreography that looks like an homage to <a href=\"http://www.mercecunningham.org/merce-cunningham/\">Merce Cunningham</a>. The stiff-legged footwork, the tight little clusters and rushes of energy are pure Merce, although the movement is also invaded by a different, less disciplined voice. It\u2019s one that shakes the dancers into looser, blurrier lines, sends them toppling off balance and disrupts the symmetry of the floor patterns \u2013 almost as though the anonymous choreographer were having his or her own argument with Cunningham\u2019s legacy.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"a1c872b0a77fb2ce6d17e0a538131d2e72fae767\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a1c872b0a77fb2ce6d17e0a538131d2e72fae767/948_0_2953_2921/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Unknown Pleasures by Dance Umbrella and CCN \u2013 Ballet de Lorraine at Sadler\u2019s Wells, London\" width=\"1000\" height=\"989\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Unknown Pleasures by Dance Umbrella and CCN\u2013Ballet de Lorraine.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Unknown Pleasures closes in grandstanding style with a setting of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bol\u00e9ro\">Ravel\u2019s Bol\u00e9ro</a>. As 11 dancers criss-cross the stage to the insistent, orgiastic swell of the music, the blatancy of their pelvis-thrusting demeanour, their swagger and strut feel like a parody of the classic <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpdFYhf3XZ8\">B\u00e9jart</a> version of the same score. But there is also a strange, vivid torque to parts of the choreography that make it more animalistic than human, with the dancers springing across the stage on their hands and knees, or with their arms angled above their heads like antlers. The work also springs a sweet and funny surprise as the central couple, who first emerge from the group like jousting animals on heat, end up sitting cosily together on the edge of the stage, two quietly domesticated lovers.</p> <p>Overall it\u2019s a good evening of dance \u2013 and #2 and #5 are both works I would particularly like to see again. But while I was watching Unknown Pleasures I found the question of context and authorship a nagging distraction, which at times got between me and the stage. Perhaps the critic\u2019s part of my brain doesn\u2019t know how to shut up. But as a species we are wired to be puzzle solvers; given the conversations I had with other people, and the conversations I overheard, I wasn\u2019t alone in finding the evening as much of a quiz as a liberation. The programme will go on international tour and at the end of its run, I\u2019d be happy to see it return to Umbrella \u2013 but this time with the name credits inserted. It\u2019s not that I\u2019m desperate to know how well I scored at Guess the Choreographer, but I would be able to absorb myself far more completely with the works themselves if I wasn\u2019t bothering about their provenance. </p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://ballet-de-lorraine.eu/en/pieces/86_Unknown-pleasures-Creation-2016\">Unknown Pleasures</a> is at <a href=\"http://www.opera-national-lorraine.fr/\">Op\u00e9ra national de Lorraine</a>, Nancy, France, on 5, 6, 8 and 9 November. </p>",

Much of her time in prison was spent in the same bare cell, stripped of natural light. Artificial lights were left on day and night, said Hoodfar. Sleep came rarely. \u201cSometimes I would go for days without sleeping.\u201d </p> <p>After she <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/30/canada-iran-professor-homa-hoodfar-hospitalized-detained\">was hospitalised for a lung infection</a>, prison staff showed some hints of humanity. At times they sent her fruit juice or brought her food. Eventually she was allowed access to a few books.</p> <p>One night following two days of gruelling interrogations, she was ordered to be ready at 8am the next day. Six guards escorted her to the apartment where she had been staying to collect her things and insisted she visit a salon to get her greying roots dyed before outfitting her in bright colours. \u201cThey wanted me to look good,\u201d said Hoodfar. </p> <p>It was then that she began to suspect that she was about to be released. After a 19-hour flight from Oman spent jotting down the notes she had memorised after painstakingly scratching them on to her cell walls, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/29/iran-homa-hoodfar-returns-canada\">Hoodfar landed at Montreal\u2019s airport last week. </a></p> <p>She left behind several dual nationals from the US, UK, Canada and Britain who continue to face questioning or languish behind bars.

While much of the reality of her ordeal has yet to sink in, the experience has left her grappling with her identity as an Iranian-Canadian. \u201cI\u2019m heartbroken. I know I\u2019m a Canadian as well and I lived most of my time outside, but I was born there and brought up there and I never felt I was an outsider,\u201d she said. \u201cBut they treated me like an enemy and that hurt more than the fact that I was in jail.\u201d </p>",

  "<p>It was an unusual burglary, in which four or five laptops were stolen from a Scottish renewable energy manufacturer in the dead of a March night in 2011.

Pelamis was one of the cutting-edge companies, originally named the Ocean Power Delivery company when founded in 1998 and renamed Pelamis Wave Power in 2007.</p> <p>The company, which employed a staff of 50, developed a giant energy wave machine, which it named Pelamis. It looked like a metal snake, facing directly into the waves, harnessing the power of the sea. It had a unique hinged joint system that helped regulate energy flow as waves ran down its length.</p> <p> Other revolutionary features included a sophisticated control system and a quick mechanism for releasing it into the sea and recovering it. In 2004, it became the first wave-energy machine to generate electricity into the grid.</p> <p>China expressed interest in December 2010 in an email to Pelamis: \u201cIt is decided that His Excellency, Mr Li Keqiang, vice-premier of the state council of China, and the delegation (60 people) headed by him will pay a visit to the Pelamis Sea Energy Converter between 16.40 and 17.00 on Sunday 9 January.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6dafbfd2f7ae9d49687987122494ed8c9e00b4e6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6dafbfd2f7ae9d49687987122494ed8c9e00b4e6/0_0_3000_2242/1000.jpg\" alt=\"China\u2019s Vice Premier Li Keqiang (C) is escorted on a tour of the Pelamis Wave Power factory on January 9, 2011 in Edinburgh, Scotland.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"747\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Li Keqiang (centre) is escorted on a tour of the Pelamis factory on 9 January 2011 in Edinburgh.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: WPA Pool/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p> Li, who is now premier of China, was accompanied by other senior Chinese government officials and was shown round the key stages in the construction of Pelamis at the site in Leith, Edinburgh.</p> <p>Moore was his host for the visit and recalled the Chinese had been very impressed.

It is intriguing.\u201d<br></p> <p>The day was rounded off with the dinner at the castle. A Scottish government memo setting out the itinerary said: \u201cEvening dinner at castle with whisky tasting, Scottish dancing, crown jewels.\u201d <br></p> <p>Any faint hopes that the Chinese might invest in the Pelamis project proved fruitless however. Three years later, in November 2014, Pelamis went into administration, having run out of funding after 17 years developing the project at a cost of \u00a395m.</p> <p>Two months after the Chinese visit, on the night of Monday 22 March 2011, the Pelamis office was broken into.

They skipped the first-floor office of the German engineering giant Siemens and continued to Pelamis on the second floor. </p> <p>Police Scotland, in a statement confirming the break-in, said no one had ever been caught. \u201cEntry was forced to a business premises on Bath Road in Edinburgh between 11pm 21 March and 6.45 am on 22 March 2011,\u201d the police said.<br></p> <p> \u201cA number of laptops, collectively worth a four-figure sum, were stolen from within. Officers conducted extensive inquiries at the time and any new information received will be thoroughly investigated.\u201d</p> <p>Break-ins at dockyards are not unusual. Pelamis had suffered before when copper cables were stolen from its site. But theft of laptops from its office was a first.<br></p> <p>The pictures from China, show that the product, as well as looking roughly the same, also seems to have specific features such as a similar-looking hinged joint system and a similar system for placing in and recovering the project from the sea.

  "<p>Towards the end of Sunday\u2019s second televised <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-elections-2016\" title=\"\">US presidential debate</a>, Hillary Clinton said something that political candidates often say, but which in 2016 is no longer the usual banality. \u201cThis is not an ordinary time,\u201d said Mrs Clinton. \u201cAnd this is not an ordinary election.\u201d If anything, this was an understatement. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/09/presidential-debate-reactions-trump-clinton\" title=\"\">The second debate</a> between her and Donald Trump, and the days running up to it, have been extraordinary living and livid proof of that.</p> <p>Rarely in any democratic country, never mind in the world\u2019s most powerful democracy, can the substance and the temper of the debate have been so low, so dark, so personal and so damaging as it has now become in the US race. The responsibility for this cannot be dismissed as six of one and half a dozen of the other. The responsibility for it rests squarely with Mr Trump, his campaign and his personality. To take just one example: in most democracies, the tape that exploded into the public arena <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-recorded-having-extremely-lewd-conversation-about-women-in-2005/2016/10/07/3b9ce776-8cb4-11e6-bf8a-3d26847eeed4_story.html\" title=\"\">at the end of last week</a>, in which Mr Trump was heard boasting about his sexual aggression towards women, would have destroyed his candidacy. He would have been forced to quit, partly because of the offensiveness of his words and views, and partly so his party\u2019s other candidates can save their electoral skins.</p> <p>Yet not only did Mr Trump brazen the tape out at the weekend, but on Sunday night he deliberately went lower and darker still. Shortly before the debate, Mr Trump held a press conference championing women who claim to have been Bill Clinton\u2019s past sexual targets. This attempt to fan the stone-cold embers of arguments that distracted and demeaned America nearly 20 years ago was a clear signal. It showed that Mr Trump will fight as dirty as he can, all the way to November. It also suggested that his focus is on firing up the angriest and most paranoid parts of the Republican vote. This was confirmed once the debate was under way, when Mr Trump insulted, abused and patronised Mrs Clinton at every opportunity, both in his words and by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/10/presidential-debate-trump-bully-clinton\" title=\"\">intimidatory platform manner</a> that his admirer Nigel Farage revealingly likened to the dominant behaviour of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/10/nigel-farage-fights-donald-trumps-corner-in-post-debate-spin-room\" title=\"\">a silverback gorilla</a>.</p> <p>There have been other bitter presidential contests in the US. Yet this contest has become a break with the past that will not be easily repaired and for which America will pay a price at home and abroad, whatever the outcome next month. When before did one candidate say of another in debate that they have \u201ctremendous hate\u201d in their heart? Or refer to his opponent as the devil? And when before did one candidate say, as Mr Trump did, that, if elected, he would try to see his opponent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/10/debate-donald-trump-threatens-to-jail-hillary-clinton\" title=\"\">prosecuted and put in jail</a>. That\u2019s what happens in autocracies and dictatorships. It\u2019s the way leaders behave in countries with no respect for the rule of law or the separation of powers. But it has not been the way, until now, in America.</p> <p>Mr Trump does all this partly because that is the kind of person he is: impulsive, rude, aggressive, extreme. He does it partly because there has always been something violent and vengeful about the white right in the US. And he does it partly because his rise has been one manifestation of a global anger against democracy\u2019s failures to control the rich and compensate the poor.</p> <p>But it is no accident that this is happening in the first US presidential race in which a woman may win. Of course, Mr Trump would behave aggressively if his Democratic opponent were a man too. He\u2019s that kind of bully. But his anger through the campaign, and in Sunday\u2019s debate, is the anger of a man who cannot treat women as equals. In another remark in the debate Mrs Clinton said her vision of America is of somewhere where everyone has a place. Mr Trump\u2019s view of women\u2019s place does not bear thinking about \u2013 and should not be voted for.</p>",

  "<p>Polish cinema burst upon the world in the 1950s with Andrzej Wajda\u2019s war trilogy, A Generation, Kana\u0142 and Ashes and Diamonds, with the director becoming the voice of disaffected postwar youth. A generation later, Wajda, who has died aged 90, was the voice of Poland again, as the country struggled to survive political and economic turmoil.</p> <p>Wajda was born in Suwa\u0142ki, in north-east Poland, the son of Aniela (nee Bia\u0142ow\u0105s), a schoolteacher, and Jakub, a cavalry officer killed by the Soviets in 1940 in what was known as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2010/apr/24/katyn-massacre-poland-president\">Katyn massacre</a>. It was many years before Wajda decided to cover the tragedy, making the film <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/jun/19/katyn-andrzej-wajda-film-review\">Katy</a><a>\u0144</a> (2007).</p> <p>During the second world war, Wajda had joined the resistance at the age of 16, and after liberation he enrolled at the renowned film school in \u0141\u00f3d\u017a. On graduating in 1952, he worked as assistant to Aleksander Ford on Five Boys from Barska Street (1954), a rather preachy piece that paralleled the rehabilitation of juvenile delinquents with the reconstruction of Poland.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuqPOluaJS8\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ZuqPOluaJS8?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Ashes and Diamonds, 1958. Wajda became the voice of disaffected postwar youth.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Wajda\u2019s first feature gave a very different view of Polish youth. A Generation (1954) forcibly expressed a youthful bitterness and an anti-romantic attitude to the war. The title refers to Poland\u2019s \u201clost generation\u201d, those who had been teenagers during the war. Kana\u0142 (1957), literally translated as \u201csewer\u201d, starkly created the claustrophobic nightmare of Polish patriots escaping the Nazis in the sewers of Warsaw during the uprising of 1944. In this, his second film, Wajda\u2019s great technical skill was immediately apparent from the remarkable opening tracking shots. Some weaknesses in characterisation and heavy-handed references to Dante\u2019s Inferno did not lessen the powerful theme and imagery.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7495d8747d9ae0eb880f5c0ee71f9eb1f2ba1e65\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7495d8747d9ae0eb880f5c0ee71f9eb1f2ba1e65/0_173_3104_1862/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Andrzej Wajda in 2016.

Its enigmatic, twilight world communicated the \u201cPolish experience\u201d beyond the frontiers as few films have done. The brilliant young actor <a href=\"http://culture.pl/en/artist/zbigniew-cybulski\">Zbigniew Cybulski</a> embodied the sceptical new generation in his anti-heroic role of a nationalist ordered to kill a communist leader. The assassination scene, Cybulski\u2019s death and the slow motion polonaise climax are stunningly realised. The great theme of Polish cinema \u2013 the occupation and resistance movement \u2013 was shown in a new light. \u201cThe war was no longer regarded as a heroic necessity, but a supreme example of suffering made up of individual tragedies which could never be wiped out by either a common faith or the victorious outcome of the war,\u201d wrote the critic Anton\u00edn Liehm.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVedEkQIXLU\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/nVedEkQIXLU?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>A Generation, 1955</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Cybulski also appeared in Wajda\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETkNWL2pFwc\">Innocent Sorcerers</a> (1960), an ironic sex comedy which uncompromisingly dealt with modern Polish youth. Sadly, the shortsighted Cybulski was killed while running for a train in 1967, at the age of 40, and Everything for Sale (1969) was Wajda\u2019s film-within-a-film homage to the actor.</p> <p>Driven by \u201ccensorship behind closed doors\u201d, Wajda made films from the mid-1960s to the mid-70s that were mainly adaptations of Polish allegorical novels, but even in his period films (The Birchwood, The Wedding, The Young Ladies of Wilko), he was able to comment obliquely on contemporary Poland through the use of symbolism and ironic allusions. Landscape After Battle (1970) was taken from the stories of Tadeusz Borowski, an Auschwitz survivor who took his own life in 1951, aged 28. The film, made in a non-realist, lyrical style using subdued colour, not only portrayed a tender love story but raised a polemical voice on the ambiguity of Polish behaviour during the war.</p> <p>With the slight relaxation of censorship, Wajda returned to overt political subjects, reflecting on the immediate past with Man of Marble (1977), a bold, no-frills, no-holds-barred story on the life of a worker-hero of the Stalinist 50s who falls from official favour, relevant in audiences\u2019 minds to the crushing of the workers\u2019 action in Gda\u0144sk in 1970.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"58677099e6c673b966531da922fd5a972a181e83\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/58677099e6c673b966531da922fd5a972a181e83/0_81_2685_1611/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kana\u0142, 1957.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kana\u0142, 1957.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Like his hero, Wajda was thought to have gone over the official limits, and the film\u2019s release was held up for four years. \u201cHis theatrical and film output and the interviews he gives demonstrate that, in ideological and political terms, he is not with us. He takes the stand, often met with in artists, of an impartial judge of the history of our days.\u201d So read a passage from the file on Wajda kept by the censors\u2019 office.</p> <p>Man of Iron (1981), the sequel to Man of Marble, leapt off the screen as freshly as the day\u2019s headlines. Filmed under enormous pressure during the actual events, it took the personal story of the son of the hero of the first film (played by the same actor, Jerzy Radziwi\u0142owicz), and set it against the wider struggle for the recognition of Solidarity. The interest of the two \u201cMan\u201d films, told in a straightforward, unfussy narrative technique, depended to a large extent on their political topicality. Yet Wajda\u2019s recognition of the fragility of the people making history, and his avoidance of heroics, continues to keep a hold after the events depicted have moved into the dim past.</p> <p>It is a theme he returned to in Danton, which was made in France in 1982. At the time of its release, the central ideological conflict between the warmly idealistic Danton (G\u00e9rard Depardieu) and the coldly pragmatic Robespierre (Wojciech Pszoniak) seemed analogous with that of Lech Wa\u0142\u0119sa and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/may/25/general-wojciech-jaruzelski\">General Wojciech Jaruzelski</a>, although the film was based on a 1931 Polish play.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-b7Rtu-nuk\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/u-b7Rtu-nuk?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Danton, 1983</figcaption> </figure>   <p>At the end of Man of Marble, a film director and a shipyard worker walk arm in arm to face the controlling bureaucrats together, a symbol of the unity of workers and artists and of the significant part played by the Polish cinema in bringing it about. By 1990, the symbol had become a reality when Wa\u0142\u0119sa won the presidency and Wajda became a senator.</p> <p>Wajda\u2019s post-communist films had less urgency, but he was able to take a sober look at the past.

  "<p>It would be \u201ca really good result\u201d if Britain ends up taking only 300 lone child refugees from the camp in Calais, the home secretary has said.</p> <p>Amber Rudd\u2019s comments before the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/08/child-refugees-calais-camp-stranded-britain-ignored-pleas-home-office\">expected demolition of the Calais refugee camp</a> next week are likely to disappoint campaigners fighting for the future of 387 children who have a legal right to come to the UK and whose details have been passed to the Home Office.</p> <p>Rudd, who is meeting the French interior minister, Bernard Cazeneuve, on Monday to discuss dismantling the camp, told the Daily Mail: \u201cWe have about 100 in train who we hope to bring over in the next few weeks but on top of that I\u2019ve made it clear that we will take children from the Dubs agreement.\u201d</p> <p>The government committed to relocate a number of lone child migrants to the UK \u201cas soon as possible\u201d under the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/may/03/alf-dubs-antisemitism-islamophobia-racism\">Dubs amendment</a> to the Immigration Act, which gave support to unaccompanied children across Europe. No figure was specified in the legislation, but it was understood that homes would be found for thousands. </p> <p>Rudd said official estimates of unaccompanied children in the Calais camp ranged between 600 and 900, adding: \u201cIf we ended up taking half of that lesser number that would be a really good result.\u201d</p> <p>The demolition of the Calais refugee camp could go ahead as early as 17 October if an agreement is reached between Rudd and Cazeneuve at the meeting in London on Monday. The camp\u2019s population of up to 10,000 asylum seekers is to be dispersed within the next few weeks.</p> <p>Cazeneuve is expected to press Rudd to speed up the processing of asylum applications made on behalf of hundreds of unaccompanied children in the Calais camp.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a0a58425e2352915b6b7708c961927b15af84f4d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a0a58425e2352915b6b7708c961927b15af84f4d/0_230_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Amber Rudd, the home secretary\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Amber Rudd, the home secretary.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stefan Rousseau/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWe cannot imagine the UK, with its traditions of human rights, will refuse to admit unaccompanied minors into the UK.

France and Britain have each blamed each other for failing to register the child refugees properly.</p> <p>Cazeneuve\u2019s spokesman refused to discuss the precise date the camp would be dismantled, saying discretion was necessary to prevent disruption or attracting large numbers to the camp in its final days or weeks.</p> <p>Citizens UK backed by the Labour peer Lord Dubs passed on the names and details of the 387 lone child refugees who they believe have the legal right to come to the UK four weeks ago. They included 178 who have the right to come to the UK on the grounds that they have close family ties. A further 209 were said to qualify under the terms of the Dubs amendment.</p> <p>Anne Longfield, the children\u2019s commissioner for England, has thrown her weight behind the calls for the UK to speed up the processing of minors in the camp. \u201cI asked the French authorities to determine which children from the emergency Calais refugee camp are eligible to come to the UK to ensure their safety and process them immediately,\u201d she said at the weekend. \u201cIt is unacceptable that some must currently wait up to nine months to see if they can come or not.\u201d </p>",

For example, suppose the agent is a manager whose actions influence her own firm\u2019s share price, but not share prices of other firms. Does that mean that the manager\u2019s pay should depend only on her firm\u2019s share price?</p> <p>The answer is no. Since share prices reflect other factors in the economy \u2013 outside the manager\u2019s control \u2013 simply linking compensation to the firm\u2019s share price will reward the manager for good luck and punish her for bad luck. It is better to link the manager\u2019s pay to her firm\u2019s share price relative to those of other, similar firms (such as those in the same industry).</p> <p>A related result is that the harder it is to observe the manager\u2019s effort \u2013 perhaps due to many distorting factors blurring the relationship between her effort and the company\u2019s performance \u2013 the less the manager\u2019s pay should be based on performance. In industries with high risk, payment should thus be relatively more biased towards a fixed salary, while in more stable environments it should be more biased towards a performance measure.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57fb6fcbe4b03b4fd4fa5e8b\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-10T10:47:42.021Z\">11.47am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">How Nobel prize winner shows failings of private prisons</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Oliver Hart</strong>\u2019s research work has included a damning assessment of America\u2019s private prisons.</p> <p>He shows that the pressure to cut costs is too great, leading to unacceptable drops in quality. At the core is the issue of \u2018incomplete contracts\u2019 -- the fact that contracts aren\u2019t detailed enough to cover every nitty-gritty point.</p> <p>The Royal Swedish Academy say:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Another application of Hart\u2019s theory of incomplete contracts concerns the division between the private and public sectors. Should providers of public services, such as schools, hospitals, and prisons, be privately-owned or not? According to the theory, this depends on the nature of non-contractible investments. Suppose a manager who runs a welfare-service facility can make two types of investment: some improve quality, while others reduce cost at the expense of quality. Additionally, suppose that such investments are difficult to specify in a contract. If the government owns the facility and employs a manager to run it, the manager will have little incentive to provide either type of investment, since the government cannot credibly promise to reward these efforts. If a private contractor provides the service, incentives for investing in both quality and cost reduction are stronger. A 1997 article by Hart, together with Andrei Shleifer and Robert Vishny, showed that incentives for cost reduction are typically too strong. The desirability of privatisation therefore depends on the trade-off between cost reduction and quality. In their article, Hart and his co-authors were particularly concerned about private prisons. Federal authorities in the United States are in fact ending the use of private prisons, partly because \u2013 according to a recently released U.S. Department of Justice report \u2013 conditions in privately-run prisons are worse than those in publicly-run prisons.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57fb6e66e4b03258bcac636b\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-10T10:34:07.404Z\">11.34am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">The Official Announcement</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The event in Stockholm has now wrapped up, so let\u2019s recap with the official announcement:</p> <h2>The Prize in Economic Sciences 2016</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.nobelprize.org/redirect/links_out/prizeawarder.php?from=/nobel_prizes/economic-sciences/laureates/2016/press.html&amp;object=kva&amp;to=http://www.kva.se/en/\">The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences</a> has decided to award the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel 2016 to<br></p> <p><strong>Oliver Hart</strong><br>Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, USA</p> <p>and</p> <p><strong>Bengt Holmstr\u00f6m</strong><br>Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA</p> <p><em>\u201cfor their contributions to contract theory\u201d</em></p> <h2>The long and the short of contracts</h2> <p>Modern economies are held together by innumerable contracts. The new theoretical tools created by <strong>Hart</strong> and <strong>Holmstr\u00f6m</strong> are valuable to the understanding of real-life contracts and institutions, as well as potential pitfalls in contract design.</p> <p>Society\u2019s many contractual relationships include those between shareholders and top executive management, an insurance company and car owners, or a public authority and its suppliers. As such relationships typically entail conflicts of interest, contracts must be properly designed to ensure that the parties take mutually beneficial decisions. This year\u2019s laureates have developed <em>contract theory</em>, a comprehensive framework for analysing many diverse issues in contractual design, like performance-based pay for top executives, deductibles and co-pays in insurance, and the privatisation of public-sector activities.</p> <p>In the late 1970s, Bengt Holmstr\u00f6m demonstrated how a <em>principal</em> (e.g., a company\u2019s shareholders) should design an optimal contract for an <em>agent</em> (the company\u2019s CEO), whose action is partly unobserved by the principal. Holmstr\u00f6m\u2019s <em>informativeness principle</em> stated precisely how this contract should link the agent\u2019s pay to performance-relevant information. Using the basic principal-agent model, he showed how the optimal contract carefully weighs risks against incentives. In later work, Holmstr\u00f6m generalised these results to more realistic settings, namely: when employees are not only rewarded with pay, but also with potential promotion; when agents expend effort on many tasks, while principals observe only some dimensions of performance; and when individual members of a team can free-ride on the efforts of others.</p> <p>In the mid-1980s, Oliver Hart made fundamental contri-butions to a new branch of contract theory that deals with the important case of <em>incomplete contracts</em>. Because it is impossible for a contract to specify every eventuality, this branch of the theory spells out optimal allocations of control rights: which party to the contract should be entitled to make decisions in which circumstances? Hart\u2019s findings on incomplete contracts have shed new light on the ownership and control of businesses and have had a vast impact on several fields of economics, as well as political science and law. His research provides us with new theoretical tools for studying questions such as which kinds of companies should merge, the proper mix of debt and equity financing, and when institutions such as schools or prisons ought to be privately or publicly owned.</p> <p>Through their initial contributions, Hart and Holmstr\u00f6m launched contract theory as a fertile field of basic research. Over the last few decades, they have also explored many of its applications. Their analysis of optimal contractual arrangements lays an intellectual foundation for designing policies and institutions in many areas, from bankruptcy legislation to political constitutions.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-10-10T10:34:17.838Z\">at 11.34am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57fb6da2e4b05c2f1e953eca\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-10T10:30:33.828Z\">11.30am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Contracts really, really matter, says one of our new Nobel laureates:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/NobelPrize/status/785425730448523264\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">From interview today with Oliver Hart, 2016 Laureate in Economic Sci: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/NobelPrize?src=hash\">#NobelPrize</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/5W5TUM0hTZ\">pic.twitter.com/5W5TUM0hTZ</a></p>&mdash; The Nobel Prize (@NobelPrize) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NobelPrize/status/785425730448523264\">October 10, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57fb6b2ce4b03258bcac635d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-10T10:20:26.974Z\">11.20am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here are some practical examples of the issues which Hart and Holmstr\u00f6m\u2019s work can help answer:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/NobelPrize/status/785418644901728256\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Contract theory: Should providers of public services, such as schools, hospitals, or prisons, be publicly or privately owned? <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/NobelPrize?src=hash\">#NobelPrize</a></p>&mdash; The Nobel Prize (@NobelPrize) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NobelPrize/status/785418644901728256\">October 10, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/NobelPrize/status/785418698970525696\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Contract theory: Should teachers, healthcare workers, and prison guards be paid fixed salaries or should their pay be performance-based?</p>&mdash; The Nobel Prize (@NobelPrize) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NobelPrize/status/785418698970525696\">October 10, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/NobelPrize/status/785418772299612161\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Contract theory: To what extent should managers be paid through bonus programmes or  stock options?  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/NobelPrize?src=hash\">#NobelPrize</a></p>&mdash; The Nobel Prize (@NobelPrize) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NobelPrize/status/785418772299612161\">October 10, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57fb6a91e4b03258bcac635b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-10T10:17:57.800Z\">11.17am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Oliver Hart</strong> has revealed that he was lying in bed, wondering if his chance had gone, when the phone burst deliciously into life....</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/NobelPrize/status/785419535755214848\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">\u201cI woke at about 4:40 and was wondering whether it was getting too late for it to be this year, but then fortunately the phone rang\u201d O.

  "<h2>Trump goes low while Clinton is subdued in debate </h2> <p>Donald Trump is waiting to learn this morning if he did enough in his debate performance last night to stabilize his floundering presidential campaign. In a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/10/highlights-second-presidential-debate-trump-clinton-video\">heated match-up</a> in St Louis that followed the release of a tape last week of him crudely bragging about groping women, the Republican nominee exceeded low expectations.

Clinton accused the businessman of being in the pocket of Vladimir Putin, but looked rattled by the brutal onslaught over her record in office. Trump began the night by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/09/donald-trump-women-bill-clinton-sex-scandal-hillary-debate\">introducing three women</a> at a press conference who had accused the candidate\u2019s husband of rape or sexual assault in the 1990s, and one woman, raped as a child, whose assailant Hillary Clinton defended, as ordered by a judge, when she was a 27-year-old lawyer.

  "<p>It sounds the driest of subjects, but the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/economics-blog/live/2016/oct/10/nobel-prize-in-economics-2016-awarded-live\">Nobel prize-winning work of Oliver Hart and Bengt Holmstr\u00f6m</a> on the theory of contracts is key to understanding some of the most contentious political issues of the age.</p> <p>Take the question of how executives should be rewarded. Pay packages tend to be a mix of basic salary, bonuses and share options, with the aim of getting the best of those running companies.</p> <p>The best sort of contract, according to the work pioneered by Holmstr\u00f6m is one that provides the right balance of risk and incentives. It encourages top staff to innovate without being reckless.</p> <p>A package weighted towards bonuses might be fine for a younger executive with ambitions to be promoted. It might be less good for a chief executive approaching retirement, who might be given the green light to take risky decisions safe in the knowledge that someone else will have to clear up the mess if they go wrong.</p> <p>Holmstr\u00f6m clearly thinks companies have not been paying enough attention to his work. After hearing he was a joint winner of this year\u2019s prize, he said he thought bonuses were \u201cextraordinarily high\u201d and the contracts too complicated.</p> <p>Hart has specialised in what are known as incomplete contracts \u2013 where, for example, there is an agreement to deliver a service but it is impossible to specify precisely how this should be done.</p> <p>This matters because there are two, often conflicting, forces at work when a government decides whether it should run its own services or privatise them: improvements to quality and cost reduction. Hart\u2019s work shows that if the government\u2019s main priority is to improve quality it should retain control, since private providers usually have too strong an incentive to cut costs.</p> <p>This can result in an unacceptable drop in quality. One example cited by Hart was the US prison system, where a paper written almost two decades ago expressed concern about those in private hands.</p> <p>The US government now accepts that conditions in privately run prisons are significantly worse than those that are publicly owned and has decided to end their use.</p>",

Dre, whose real name is Andre Young, denies abusing his ex-partner.</p> <p>The film is said to show Dre\u2019s character punching Michel\u2019le in the face, pulling her hair and pulling a gun on her. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9j1XMJDGaE\">A trailer for the film</a> shows Dre\u2019s character gripping Michel\u2019le by the neck and threatening her.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iT16uxOEudU\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/iT16uxOEudU?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Trailer for Surviving Compton: Dre, Suge &amp; Michel\u2019le.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Last year\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2015/aug/27/straight-outta-compton-video-review\">Straight Outta Compton</a> biopic of rap group NWA, of which Dre was a member, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/aug/19/straight-outta-compton-ignores-dr-dre-abuse-of-women-say-two-former-victims\">was criticised for failing to show Dre\u2019s alleged mistreatment of women at the time</a>. Michel\u2019le, journalist Dee Barnes and rapper Tairrie B have all written in detail about Dre\u2019s alleged assaults on them.</p> <p>Michel\u2019le <a href=\"http://power1051.iheart.com/onair/the-breakfast-club-40716/rb-divas-star-michelle-talks-being-13424687/\">has accused Dre of breaking her nose and ribs</a>, and giving her several black eyes. Michel\u2019le and Tairrie B did not press charges, but Dre was charged with aggravated battery over the incident with Barnes in 1991. He pleaded no contest, and was fined $2,513 and sentenced to 240 hours of community service. A civil suit was settled out of court.</p> <p>Dre has not responded to the allegations individually, but last year <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/22/arts/music/dr-dre-apologizes-to-the-women-ive-hurt.html?_r=1\">apologised in the New York Times</a> to \u201cthe women I\u2019ve hurt\u201d. He wrote: \u201cTwenty-five years ago I was a young man drinking too much and in over my head with no real structure in my life. However, none of this is an excuse for what I did.

  "<p>If you ignore the nasty, divisive rhetoric on immigration and the worrying attempt to position \u201chuman rights lawyers\u201d as figures of hate, Theresa May\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/05/theresa-may-consigns-cameron-to-history-in-populist-speech\">conference speech</a> was basically an admission that Ed Miliband had it right. Gone was the individualism and free-market fetishism that has defined her party for decades. In its place, a focus on collectivity and the necessity of activist economic policy.</p> <p>The reception among conference attendees was fairly muted. Mutters of \u201csocialism\u201d were heard from the floor, and libertarian thinktank the <a href=\"http://www.adamsmith.org/news/may-must-accept-that-markets-not-the-state-are-the-solution-to-our-problems\">Adam Smith Institute published a statement</a> condemning the move towards government intervention.</p> <p>In many ways it feels like the death of an old order. Post-financial crash, there\u2019s little reason to believe in the efficacy of a laissez-faire approach to governance. It\u2019s strange to think that a decade ago, Labour and the Conservatives were competing over who could most enthusiastically deregulate the financial sector. The mood of the country has changed dramatically. We were told that we should celebrate the rich getting richer because the wealth would <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jan/20/trickle-down-economics-broken-promise-richest-85\">trickle down</a> and benefit us all.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There\u2019s no point telling people that immigration is beneficial for the economy if they\u2019re not feeling those benefits</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Now, there\u2019s a feeling that we\u2019ve been conned. Elites have taken us for fools as employment rights have been rolled back, communities have been destroyed and our economy has been savaged by the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/sep/22/vince-cable-criticism-attacks-capitalism\">spivs and gamblers</a>\u201d in the City. No wonder the \u201ctake back control\u201d slogan of the Vote Leave campaign was so seductive. Collective control is exactly what we\u2019d lost. EU membership became a symbol of the faceless, unaccountable, technocratic power that people in many parts of the country have grown to resent.</p> <p>In hindsight, the return of class politics was inevitable. Twenty years ago, John Prescott told us that \u201cwe are all middle-class now\u201d \u2013 but in 2016, the stark divisions in our society are impossible to ignore. Across Europe, centrism is in a similar state of decline. Even the term seems outdated, as the centre point of public opinion is now in a different place altogether. Collectivism is the new mainstream. The most relevant debate isn\u2019t over the necessity of working together, it\u2019s about who is allowed in the tent.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/oct/05/theresa-may-tory-party-conference-video-highlights\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/565ge\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2779394\"            data-video-name=\"Theresa May's speech to Tory conference: \u2018Change has got to come\u2019 \u2013 video highlights\"            data-video-provider=\"ITN\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57f51072e4b08ebe3d557166\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/10/05/161005Mayhighlightsagain2_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/10/05/161005Mayhighlightsagain2.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/10/05/161005Mayhighlightsagain2_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/oct/05/theresa-may-tory-party-conference-video-highlights\">Theresa May\u2019s speech to Tory conference: \u2018Change has got to come\u2019</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>At the dawn of the post-liberal era we have the opportunity to make a choice. When we demand policy that benefits the majority rather than an elite minority, who does that include? There are two options here and it\u2019s clear which May has opted for. The sort of rightwing, xenophobic rhetoric she espouses has a long and unillustrious history. Focusing her critique primarily on economic elites would probably be difficult given that they make up the majority of Conservative party donors and cabinet ministers. Instead, she has trained her guns on a group far less able to fight back: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/05/the-message-of-brexit-was-mixed-now-we-are-told-it-was-simply-a-referendum-on-immigration\">migrant workers</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/feb/18/mass-eu-migration-into-britain-is-actually-good-news-for-uk-economy\">Mass EU migration into Britain is actually good news for UK economy</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The terrifying thing is that this has a track record of working \u2013 and it\u2019s working again.

When people face real hardship, when they\u2019ve seen their communities decline in the face of processes they feel powerless to control, they\u2019re naturally on the lookout for someone to blame. Media barons like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/rupert-murdoch\">Rupert Murdoch</a> \u2013 who are much more the genuine enemies of working-class interests \u2013 have stoked the idea that migrants are the cause of all society\u2019s problems.</p> <p>The facts of the situation are largely irrelevant. There\u2019s no point telling people that immigration is actually beneficial for the economy if they\u2019re not feeling those benefits. Pointing out that migrants are net tax contributors doesn\u2019t have much impact when people have seen our public services gutted. On the left, we\u2019ve tried to fight powerful, emotional narratives with stats and wonkery, and unsurprisingly we\u2019ve come up short. It\u2019s time to talk to voters in language that makes sense.</p> <p>Some aspects of this will make those with liberal instincts uncomfortable. In the face of venomous, racist, anti-migrant rhetoric many of us feel a natural desire to defend freedom of movement without any qualification. This allows the line to become blurred between the utopian principle that people should be able to live wherever they want and the reality of what is currently happening.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/dec/11/the-media-needs-to-tell-the-truth-on-migration-not-peddle-myths\">The media needs to tell the truth on migration, not peddle myths | Alberto Nardelli</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Many people do not relocate out of a personal desire to experience life somewhere new, but because economic pressures compel them to seek a higher income than they\u2019d be able to secure in their place of birth. Why should someone from Sheffield or Bolton be forced to move down to London \u2013 away from family, friends and support networks? Why should someone from Poland or Romania have to live in cramped, shared accommodation and send money to a partner and children hundreds of miles away? Whose interests does this really serve?</p> <p>While supporting all workers making these decisions in the current economic context, shouldn\u2019t the left have greater ambitions than this?

And the issue is not going to go away. Climate change is the greatest looming threat and is likely to cause refugee flows magnitudes greater than the current Syrian crisis. It\u2019s going to be hard to adjust. Unless we can develop a version of collectivist politics that doesn\u2019t draw a sharp line between \u201cus\u201d and \u201cthe other\u201d, the most likely consequence is rising hate, fear, and a political culture that edges closer to the exclusionary authoritarianism of fascism.</p> <p>Labour will never convince people that it has the answers if it is forced into defending the status quo. However, the cynical triangulation attempted by some MPs in recent weeks concedes ground to xenophobia, while utterly failing to persuade voters that its advocates mean what they say. It\u2019s time to ditch the reticence and come up with a more radical vision: what do we actually want the future to look like?</p>",

I didn\u2019t have the opportunity to provide clarity, which is what he deserved.<br></p> <p>Instead it was a sloppy mess and one of the worst days of my life. He found five weeks\u2019 worth of lurid text messages and pages upon pages of emails about my affair, detailing all the lies I had told. He had to see how many times I said \u201cI love you\u201d and read about the future my lover and I were planning together. I blindsided him and all I could do in that moment was backpedal to try and make the situation easier to digest. Instead, I dug myself deeper into a hole as I attempted to cover my tracks.</p> <p>What surprised me about that night and the following days was that he fought for me. He fought hard, but I had already made up my mind, and never really gave him a chance to try.

I thought I\u2019d snap out of it.</p> <p>I didn\u2019t snap out of it. I couldn\u2019t, and frankly I got to the point where I didn\u2019t want to; it was terrifying and I was losing control.</p> <p>We said I love you after less than three weeks. This was no longer a situation that I could walk away from; it wasn\u2019t going to blow over. I came to the point where I realized I had to decide between him and my husband. I had to stop being afraid and admit to myself that I was more afraid of losing him. </p> <p>With that admission I knew that I had to tell the love of my life \u2013 the most important person to me, the person who would have given me everything \u2013 that I loved someone else. </p>",
  "<p>This year\u2019s Nobel prize in economics has been awarded to UK-born Oliver Hart and Bengt Holmstr\u00f6m of Finland for their work on contract theory, which has covered a range of issues from public-private partnerships to executive pay.</p> <p>As it <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economic-sciences/laureates/2016/press.html\">announced the prize</a>, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.nobelprize.org/redirect/links_out/prizeawarder.php?from=/nobel_prizes/economic-sciences/laureates/2016/press.html&amp;object=kva&amp;to=http://www.kva.se/en/\">the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences</a> described the pair\u2019s work as key to the understanding of the real-life contracts and institutions that hold together modern economies. </p> <p>Their research was praised for shedding light on how contracts help people deal with conflicting interests in areas such as insurance and employment. They were also recognised for helping with the design of better contracts, \u201cthereby shaping better institutions in society\u201d.</p> <p>Holmstr\u00f6m, now working at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and Hart, of Harvard University, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/economics-blog/live/2016/oct/10/nobel-prize-in-economics-2016-awarded-live\">were praised and congratulated by fellow economists</a>, although they had not been seen as frontrunners for the honour, officially known as the Sveriges Riksbank prize in economic sciences in memory of Alfred Nobel.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Holmstr\u00f6m said he certainly had not expected the 8m Swedish krona (\u00a3746,000) prize and described himself as \u201cvery lucky and grateful\u201d.

As such relationships typically entail conflicts of interest, contracts must be properly designed to ensure that the parties take mutually beneficial decisions,\u201d the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said.</p> <p>\u201cThis year\u2019s laureates have developed contract theory, a comprehensive framework for analysing many diverse issues in contractual design, like performance-based pay for top executives, deductibles and co-pays in insurance, and the privatisation of public-sector activities.\u201d</p> <p>Hart\u2019s research work has included a damning assessment of America\u2019s private prisons. He showed that the pressure to cut costs was too great, leading to an unacceptable drop in quality. At the core is the issue of \u201cincomplete contracts\u201d \u2013 the fact that contracts are not detailed enough to cover every small point.</p> <p>Holmstr\u00f6m is known for pioneering research into executive pay. His work on employment contracts has considered a range of professions from teaching to management and whether they should be paid fixed salaries or work on the basis of performance-related pay.</p> <p>Leonardo Felli, head of the economics department at the London School of Economics, where Hart is a visiting professor, said the winning pair were \u201ctwo of the most distinguished economists of our time\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cTheir analysis of the contractual relationship between individuals has enhanced our understanding of the inner functioning of modern firms, corporations and organisations, as well as providing a key insight into the basic contractual relationships between economic agents, the building block of all economic activities,\u201d said Felli.</p>",
  "<p>The usual anxiety about freedom of speech and social media runs like this: someone naive to the permanence and potential cruelty of a tweet or Facebook update posts an offensive message intended for a narrow audience of their friends or acquaintances. That message, maybe racist or misogynist or otherwise abusive, is shared more widely than its author imagined, and takes on a weight that was never intended. An overzealous police officer sees it and decides that they are obliged to do something, and the ill-advised action of a moment becomes inescapable. Even if no one has really been hurt, a life is left in ruins, and all of us become a little less free.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2016/oct/10/virtual-mobbing-doxing-amount-criminal-activity-cps\">Sexting between children not automatically a crime, says CPS</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There have been enough salutary examples of this sort of thing (everyone remembers the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2012/jul/27/twitter-joke-trial-high-court\" title=\"\">so-called Twitter joke trial</a>, where a man was dragged through court for years for making a joke about blowing up an airport if his flight was delayed) to mean that these fears are not merely hypothetical.</p> <p>And at face value, the Crown Prosecution Service\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2016/oct/10/virtual-mobbing-doxing-amount-criminal-activity-cps\" title=\"\">publication of new guidelines for cases involving social media</a> might seem to exacerbate them. The <a href=\"http://www.cps.gov.uk/news/latest_news/cps_publishes_new_social_media_guidance_and_launches_hate_crime_consultation/\" title=\"\">new rules lay out the circumstances</a> under which the CPS considers it appropriate to prosecute people for sending messages that \u201cmay be considered grossly offensive, indecent, obscene or false\u201d, conditions that sound awfully subjective. We have probably all said something, online or off, that might seem to fit one of those four categories; we don\u2019t usually believe that these misjudgments make us criminals.</p> <p>Look more closely at the guidelines, though, and a subtler picture emerges; one of a genuine attempt to delineate between the seriously abusive and the merely crass, and which you might hope will mark the beginning of a more mature legal engagement with an aspect of modern life that is still, after all, pretty new. Yes, the rules leave open the possibility of being prosecuted for a tweet. But baked into the guidelines are a series of thresholds that make it hard to imagine a hapless teenager being sent to prison for making a bad joke.</p> <p>First, if the remarks don\u2019t constitute a threat of violence, targeted abuse, or the breach of an existing court order, the bar for prosecution is significantly higher. Prosecutors are asked to consider the unique and unstable context of online communication. They are reminded that the remarks must be more than ordinarily offensive; that satire is excluded wholesale; that unpopular opinions are not in themselves legally consequential \u201ceven if distasteful to some or painful to those subjected to it\u201d. Even then, there is a strong public interest test for prosecution. If the suspect is under 18, has expressed remorse, or the message has been deleted, or if the message would not obviously have been visible to a wide audience, the guidelines say, it is unlikely that it will be a good idea to go ahead with prosecution.</p> <p>So what, you might say. All of these rules are still open to interpretation; it is still possible to imagine an authoritarian and humourless prosecutor going too far. But the truth is that cases like the Twitter joke trial are well-known precisely because they are so rare; the CPS are now keenly aware of the public relations disaster that will follow in the case of such heavy-handed action.</p> <p>Meanwhile, for many people \u2013 particularly women and members of minorities \u2013 a life online continues to be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/series/the-web-we-want\" title=\"\">subjected to all kinds of brutal and anonymised abuse</a>. If, in this context, a mature set of guidelines seems too much to you, ask yourself this: is your concern really about the freedom of speech as it would be applied in the real world? If someone persistently marched up to strangers in the pub and screamed the kinds of abusive or discriminatory things at them that you are arguing should be protected online, do you really think they\u2019d get away with it? Or is there a bit of you that likes the idea of the internet as an unregulated wild west, where anything goes, where the normal accumulation of rules that make up civilised society no longer applies? And if it\u2019s the latter, why should the rest of us have to go along with it?</p>",
  "<p>Pope Francis has put his progressive stamp on the American Catholic church with the selection of three new like-minded cardinals \u2013 including one who has sparred with the Republican vice-presidential nominee, Mike Pence \u2013 in a clear rejection of bishops who have advocated for the church\u2019s exclusion of divorced and LGBT Catholics.</p> <p>The American choices were among 17 new cardinals named by Francis. He has chosen more from the developing world and only one from Italy, reflecting his desire to decentralise power away from the Vatican in Rome.</p> <p>In choosing these new cardinals \u2013 the \u201cprinces of the church\u201d who serve as the pope\u2019s primary advisers \u2013 Francis has made it more likely that his successor will be a moderate or progressive. It also partially balances out the influence of the cardinals chosen by his far more conservative predecessors, Pope John Paul II and Pope Benedict XVI. </p> <p>The choices could create a \u201c<a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://cruxnow.com/analysis/2016/10/09/popes-cardinal-picks-bernardins-seamless-garment-back/\">seismic shift</a>\u201d in the Catholic hierarchy in the US, according to John Allen, a commentator from Crux, a Catholic news publication. While the selection of Joseph Tobin of Indianapolis, Kevin Farrell of Dallas and Blase Cupich of Chicago could not be considered liberal by conventional political standards, Allen wrote that each was considered to be part of the \u201ccentrist, non-cultural warrior wing of the country\u2019s hierarchy\u201d.</p> <p>Of the three, Tobin was the surprise choice, in part because cardinals are usually chosen from the main centres of power in the biggest Catholic countries, and Indianapolis does not fit the bill. He has sought a greater voice for women in the church and was involved in a high-profile battle with Pence last year, after the Indiana governor \u2013 <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/04/vp-nominees-tim-kaine-mike-pence-catholic\">a former Catholic who converted to evangelical Protestantism</a> \u2013 fought Tobin\u2019s efforts to resettle Syrian refugees in the state, claiming they posed a security risk. The archbishop prevailed.</p> <p>Cupich is also seen as an advocate for Francis\u2019s agenda and has encouraged other archbishops to be a voice for workers and immigrants. Irish-born Farrell has been a vocal supporter of gun control laws.</p> <p>\u201cThe picks show Francis wants the church in America to be more focused on issues like immigration, the role of women in the church and the need to bypass traditional centres of power in order to find leaders who smell of the sheep, as the pope has put it,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.americamagazine.org/content/dispatches/new-cardinals-signal-shift-away-us-culture-wars\">wrote</a> Michael O\u2019Loughlin, a journalist for America Magazine, a Catholic publication.</p> <p>Only 13 of the 17 cardinals Francis has elected will be eligible to vote in the next conclave because of age restrictions. Three of the new \u201celectors\u201d come from Europe.<br></p> <p>The choices were noteworthy in part because of who Francis passed over for promotion, including the staunchly conservative archbishop of Philadelphia, Charles Chaput, who presides over one of the largest Catholic archdiocese in the US. Chaput made headlines this summer when he released his own interpretation of a document that had been written by Francis that was meant to encourage priests to show more \u201cdiscernment\u201d in their treatment of Catholics who had divorced and remarried, as well as other practices that fall outside church doctrine. </p> <p>Instead of emphasising the latitude Francis seemed to encourage in Amoris Laetitia (Joy of Love), Chaput set out his own rules, including that <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/06/philadelphia-catholic-church-rules-divorce-gay-sex\">remarried Catholics who wanted to receive communion needed to abstain from sex and live as brother and sister</a>, and that lesbian and gay Catholics could still opt for heterosexual marriage with children notwithstanding \u201csome degree of same-sex attraction\u201d.</p> <p>There was only one Italian among the new cardinals: Mario Zenari, the pope\u2019s ambassador to \u201cloved and tormented\u201d Syria. Calling the promotion a \u201csurprise\u201d, Zenari told Vatican radio that the honour was a gift to the victims of Syria and all those who suffer in the conflict. </p>",

Gun deaths have declined, though only slightly, between the administrations. Police fatalities have in general declined in the last 40 years: from 1991 to 2000, an average of 162 officers were killed each year; from 1981 to 1990, an average of 186; from 1971 to 1980, an average of 230.</p> <p>The deadliest era for police in the US was prohibition.

Her Attacks on Hillary Clinton Are Not.</strong></a></p> <p>To be clear, I\u2019ve always found Broaddrick\u2019s claims about Bill Clinton credible, though only the two of them know the truth. Five people say she told them about the assault right after it allegedly happened. She denied the rape in a 1997 affidavit filed with Paula Jones\u2019 lawyers but changed her story the next year, when she was interviewed by the FBI in the course of Kenneth Starr\u2019s investigation. At the time, some Clinton defenders treated her changing story as evidence of her untrustworthiness, but it seems perfectly plausible that, as she <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/24/us/on-tortuous-route-sexual-assault-accusation-against-clinton-resurfaces.html?pagewanted=all\">told</a> the <em>New York Times</em>, she hadn\u2019t wanted to go public but also felt she couldn\u2019t lie to federal investigators. In the 1990s, Clinton defenders sometimes pointed to the fact that Broaddrick attended a Clinton fundraiser three weeks after she says he raped her. But we know it\u2019s not uncommon for rape victims to blame themselves and continue to seek their rapists\u2019 favor. After all, I also believe <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/09/opinion/sunday/donald-trump-groper-in-chief.html\">Jill Harth</a>, who accused Donald Trump of sexual harassment and attempted rape, even though later, reeling from a divorce, she became his girlfriend.</p> <p>Far less credible, however, is Broaddrick\u2019s claim that Hillary Clinton tried to intimidate her into silence. </p> <p><strong>Click through above to read the full piece.</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2016/10/09/trumps-lawsuits-include-20-involving-allegations-mistreating-women-president-republican/91832012/\"><strong>Trump, companies accused of mistreating women in at least 20 lawsuits</strong></a></p> <p>One woman sued Donald Trump\u2019s Miami resort saying she lost her job because she got pregnant.</p> <p>Two others claimed they were fired after complaining that co-workers sexually harassed them.</p> <p>And a number of women testified in a lawsuit that Trump himself repeatedly instructed managers to hire younger, prettier workers at his Los Angeles golf club.</p> <p>The release of a video Friday showing Trump\u2019s sexist remarks in 2005 has created a firestorm of controversy that threatens to derail his campaign.

  "<p>We all have mental health, just as we all have physical health, and in both cases we are on a continuum, where our health can vary day to day. It is estimated that <a href=\"http://www.mind.org.uk/information-support/types-of-mental-health-problems/statistics-and-facts-about-mental-health/how-common-are-mental-health-problems/\" title=\"\">one in four people experience a mental health issue in any given year</a>, and that <a href=\"http://www.mind.org.uk/workplace/\" title=\"\">one in six employees</a> is depressed, anxious or suffering from stress-related problems at any time. However, many of us know little about mental health. We often don\u2019t spot the signs that a colleague, employee, or we ourselves are struggling, and this delays help and recovery.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/19/hillary-clinton-working-presenteeism\">Presenteeism is rising fast \u2013 and only bosses can stop it | Peter Cheese</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Last week Business in the Community (BiTC) <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/oct/04/mental-health-uk-business-employees-management-wellbeing-marks-spencer-mind\" title=\"\">released the most comprehensive report of its kind</a>, called <a href=\"http://wellbeing.bitc.org.uk/all-resources/research-articles/mental-health-work-report-2016\" title=\"\">Mental Health at Work</a>. Worryingly, the report uncovered the fact that over three-quarters of employees have experienced poor mental health, and almost half of workers would not talk to their manager about a mental health issue. And while employers are talking more about it, words are not translating into action.</p> <p>There is a disconnect between the ideals of company bosses and the reality of employees when it comes to mental health. Most board members believe their organisation is supportive on the issue, but 56% of people who have disclosed a mental health issue at work said their employer took no mitigating actions, found BiTC. How can we close this gap between perception and reality? A vital and practical step employers can take, and a key recommendation of the BiTC report, is investment in first-aid training in mental health for staff.</p> <p>Mental health first-aid is the mental health equivalent of a physical first-aid course. It teaches people the skills and confidence to recognise the signs and symptoms of common mental health issues, listen empathetically and effectively guide a person towards the right support.</p> <p>Recently, I became a mental health first-aider myself, and now have the tools to start a meaningful conversation on the issue, something most of us would struggle to do. Could you think of the right words to say to someone who may be feeling suicidal? Having experienced loss in my family the training allowed me to reflect on what I might have done differently.</p>  <!-- Invalid pullquote element without \"html\" field -->  <p>We spend a considerable amount of our lives at work and with more of us working longer hours, under more pressure, having mental health first-aid support in the workplace is critical not just for employees, but for businesses too. As it stands, mental health issues (stress, depression or anxiety) account for almost <a href=\"http://www.publicmentalhealth.org/Documents/749/Bob%20Grove.pdf\" title=\"\">70m days off sick per year</a>, the most of any health condition.</p> <p>Today, on <a href=\"http://www.who.int/mental_health/world-mental-health-day/en/\" title=\"\">World Mental Health Day</a>, with support from Mental Health First Aid (MHFA) England and Mind, I am calling on the government to act and bring parity to mental and physical health in the workplace. I\u2019m submitting an <a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/edm\" title=\"\">early day motion</a> on the issue as the first step towards amending the current legislation, which requires employers to train staff in physical first aid, to in future include mental health first aid.</p> <p>How can we possibly justify leaving the law as it is? So far as the NHS is concerned the government has committed to the principle of \u201cparity of esteem\u201d between physical and mental illness. Surely they must apply the same logic to the workplace.</p> <p>Put simply, this is a call for every workplace to have trained mental health first-aiders just like they have physical first-aiders. A number of employers are taking action. WHSmith has committed to match the number of staff that are physical first-aiders with mental health first-aiders over the next 12 months.</p> <p>There\u2019s a growing momentum for change, and hundreds more businesses across a range of sectors are implementing mental health training for staff from Unilever and Crossrail to Channel 4. Employers have a duty of care to their workforce, and with the scale of mental issues in this country much more needs to be done. The government must act now to ensure every employee has access to mental health support at work.</p>",
  "<p>America in the 1960s: a presidential assassination, landmark rights movements, a nuclear arms race, the birth of modern music, man landing on the moon, the beginning of Star Trek, and a controversial war abroad. This is a remarkable era \u2013 one barely seen in video games \u2013 and Mafia III makes good use of its cultural backdrop. It tells its story well, with smart writing and some superb characterisation that elevate its simple revenge plot. Ultimately, however, it never capitalises on its open world potential, instead succumbing to an almost constant lull of tediously unimaginative repetition that makes for a boring and dated open-world shooter.</p> <p>The game starts relatively strongly. Developer Hangar 13 successfully captures the distorted soul of the 1960s and places us in the rugged boots of Lincoln Clay \u2013 a bi-racial orphan and Vietnam veteran recently returned home to the Big Easy inspired city of New Bordeaux. He\u2019s the archetypal <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jun/13/henry-hill\">Henry Hill</a> protagonist; a likeable, loyal young guy who you root for despite his penchant for murder, torture and other reprehensible hobbies. His closest colleagues are similarly personable despite their illegal activities. Sammy, leader of the Black Mob, raised Lincoln as one of his own, while Father James Ballard is Lincoln\u2019s go-to for advice and help whenever he\u2019s in need of moral guidance.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d848a680f984ce5722895edf8c23cf3e9217fcff\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d848a680f984ce5722895edf8c23cf3e9217fcff/60_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A mafia boss at a desk with CCTV behind him.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A strong introduction makes way for hours of cookie cutter objectives.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hangar 13</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>These well-paced first hours cement the game\u2019s unflinching depiction of the racism and violence that dominated so much of 20th century America. An excellent script, great voice acting and convincing facial animations bring the game\u2019s lavish cutscenes to life, and the faux documentary cuttings create the sense that the game\u2019s events are historical recounts than fictional escapades.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>After a violent double-crossing that leaves Sammy and his closest associates dead at the hands of Mafia kingpin Sal Marcano, Lincoln sets out to bring down the organisation that spreads across New Bordeaux\u2019s multiple unique districts. In order to do this, he recruits several associates across the city to bring down Marcano\u2019s henchman, his rackets and eventually the man himself. Unfortunately, what should be a narrative flashpoint to ignite the action and set in motion a roller coaster revenge ride is instead Mafia III\u2019s stumbling point. A strong introduction makes way for hours of cookie cutter objectives that fail to sustain the pace, adrenaline or imagination.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"372cf5590d04449f9c5b86bc3a674280af374644\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/372cf5590d04449f9c5b86bc3a674280af374644/60_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mafia 3 screenshot showing a fight\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Guns are punchy, headshots bloody and there\u2019s satisfaction in capping goons with Tommy guns.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hangar 13</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The core gameplay is solid \u2013 guns are punchy, headshots bloody and there\u2019s satisfaction in capping goons with Tommy guns and pump-action shotguns \u2013 but the simplicity of your core tasks just doesn\u2019t progress anywhere.

Your three underbosses are the only real flavour of your moment-to-moment interactions in New Bordeaux. Cassandra is the leader of the Haitian mob, Burke is the head of the Irish mob, and Vito \u2013 the slick-haired protagonist from Mafia 2 \u2013 is a high ranking member of the Italian mob who\u2019s now been put on a hitlist.

A horror-esque shoot-out through an abandoned fairground, a scrapyard sniper battle with one of Marcano\u2019s underbosses, and a great car chase with your associate Vito. These standout missions appear every couple of hours, but are locked behind a ton of boring objectives that you have to do in order to get through to the next interesting chunk of story exposition.<br></p> <p>Progressing through the game and assigning districts to your underbosses unlocks new abilities. Call up an arms dealer and he\u2019ll turn up in a whacky Mystery Machine so you can buy guns, restock ammo and buy new abilities before assaulting an enemy hideout. Call an Irish hit squad for assistance during a raid, or call your Consigliere to pick up your precious money and stash it in your safe so you don\u2019t lose it when you die. They\u2019re cool little features, but they\u2019re not enough to redeem the terminal gameplay loop.

The aesthetic highs are also contrasted with a surprising level of technical disappointments. Flat textures, weird daytime lighting, muddy sky boxes and some ugly \u201cpop-in\u201d moments make for a really jarring mix of good and bad throughout, while visual glitches are an issue on both PS4 and PC. It\u2019s a credit to Hangar 13\u2019s world building that despite these problems there are still several hours of entertainment to be found in cruising around shooting goons, or pulling off a car chase through Downtown with a dozen cop cars on your tail with \u201cBorn to be Wild\u201d blaring out of the stereo. But it\u2019s also a real shame that such a unique and fresh setting goes to waste.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>To say Mafia III is a disappointment is an understatement.

The colonial misuse of S\u00e1mi symbols is a heated topic here in the north.

The pine trees are ubiquitous and their aroma is subtle yet distinctive. One catches the entire range of it by taking a walk in a summery evergreen forest, heating a sauna with firewood and then maybe enjoying a reindeer dish seasoned with pine or juniper in one of the fine dining restaurants that experiment with tastes of the Arctic.</p> <h2>Underrated location</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"56761bbc16b6cc6e3a2c86f68e5f232b0ff7e371\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/56761bbc16b6cc6e3a2c86f68e5f232b0ff7e371/0_0_1024_683/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rovaniemi\u2019s annual bonfire.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rovaniemi\u2019s annual bonfire.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Olli Junes</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Located on the Arctic Circle, my home town has built its reputation around extremes: the white nights of summer and the polar nights of the Christmas season. Rovaniemi lies on the shores of the river Kemijoki, which is a popular destination for summer and winter swimmers alike, as well as a much loved ice-covered venue for winter sports and leisure. The riverside and its events in autumn, however, don\u2019t get much attention.<br></p> <p>Throughout autumn \u2013 starting with the <a href=\"http://www.visitrovaniemi.fi/experience-rovaniemi/events/old-market-square-carnival-of-rovaniemi-old-market-square\">Rovaniemi Old Time Fair</a> (<em>Rovaniemen Wanhat Markkina</em><em>t</em>) on J\u00e4tk\u00e4npuisto strand in August \u2013 cultural events and harvest markets take place on the riverside.  In the beginning of November the Arctic fall is crowned by an annual bonfire art event, Riverlights (<em>Jokivalkeat</em>).</p> <p>If there are no special seasonal events on, I recommend opting for a calming river walk to a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lavvu\">laavu</a>, an open hut, and enjoy hot cocoa and snacks.

The Moscow Armistice (September 1944) between the Soviet Union and Finland ended the four-year alliance between Nazi Germany and Finland, once united by their mutual enemy in war. As a result, German troops withdrew from Finnish Lapland and its capital Rovaniemi using a scorched earth policy. There\u2019s still debate on what happened next, but 90% of the buildings were destroyed, including homes and farms. Even the town\u2019s ski jump ramp was reduced to rubble and ashes.<br></p> <p>The blaze demolished everything familiar to the locals and today\u2019s rebuilt Rovaniemi is naturally something very different. Understandably some locals tend to criticise the modern blocks of flats of the centre, yearning for something \u201cold and authentic\u201d. On the other hand, Rovaniemi wouldn\u2019t be the same, original town of its own kind if it had not been forced to reinvent itself.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Many people choose to cycle to work, school and nightclubs all year around, whether it is 30C above or below zero</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <h2>Best Instagram account</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Instagram.\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;instagram-media&quot; data-instgrm-version=&quot;7&quot; style=&quot; background:#FFF; border:0; border-radius:3px; box-shadow:0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width:658px; padding:0; width:99.375%; width:-webkit-calc(100% - 2px); width:calc(100% - 2px);&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;padding:8px;&quot;&gt; &lt;div style=&quot; background:#F8F8F8; line-height:0; margin-top:40px; padding:50% 0; text-align:center; width:100%;&quot;&gt; &lt;div style=&quot; background:url(data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAACwAAAAsCAMAAAApWqozAAAABGdBTUEAALGPC/xhBQAAAAFzUkdCAK7OHOkAAAAMUExURczMzPf399fX1+bm5mzY9AMAAADiSURBVDjLvZXbEsMgCES5/P8/t9FuRVCRmU73JWlzosgSIIZURCjo/ad+EQJJB4Hv8BFt+IDpQoCx1wjOSBFhh2XssxEIYn3ulI/6MNReE07UIWJEv8UEOWDS88LY97kqyTliJKKtuYBbruAyVh5wOHiXmpi5we58Ek028czwyuQdLKPG1Bkb4NnM+VeAnfHqn1k4+GPT6uGQcvu2h2OVuIf/gWUFyy8OWEpdyZSa3aVCqpVoVvzZZ2VTnn2wU8qzVjDDetO90GSy9mVLqtgYSy231MxrY6I2gGqjrTY0L8fxCxfCBbhWrsYYAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC); display:block; height:44px; margin:0 auto -44px; position:relative; top:-22px; width:44px;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style=&quot; color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/wmRIs2iYbW/&quot; style=&quot; color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px; text-decoration:none;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;A photo posted by Antti Kertsi Ker\u00e4nen (@cvltfvck)&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;time style=&quot; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;&quot; datetime=&quot;2014-12-14T18:54:49+00:00&quot;&gt;Dec 14, 2014 at 10:54am PST&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;script async defer src=&quot;//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Antti Ker\u00e4nen is a 22-year-old nature photographer whose eerie and gloomy Instagram feed tells otherworldly stories from the midst of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiga\">taiga</a>.

More than just down-at-heel, this main port district of Lima was downright dangerous, notorious as a haunt of gangs smuggling cocaine worldwide.</p> <p>Founded by conquistadors in 1537, Callao grew into the most important port in the Spanish colonies. It flourished in the 19th century, which saw the building of grand plazas and South America\u2019s first railway.

To put it another way, if you\u2019ve felt the need to choose a selective education for your own child, it becomes somewhat tricky to argue against other people\u2019s child having one \u2013 particularly when they\u2019re considerably less advantaged than you.</p> <p>No matter how genuine their conflict, it\u2019s ironic how hard some politicians or high-profile campaigners seem to find sending their child to state school. The reality is, it should be easier for them than many of us: they can afford to live in the wealthiest catchment areas, often in London, with some of the best state schools in the country at their disposal. They can also rest easy that they\u2019re giving their children all they need at home: after all, the same high-profile job that brings scrutiny also brings the cushion of a generous salary, control over working hours, and a parent with (often) an Oxbridge education. More than many families, a politician\u2019s child is hardly starting with a disadvantage, in desperate need of a leg up.</p> <p>When Chakrabarti points to the fact she\u2019s surrounded by homeless people and food banks \u2013 the inference being, no one would accuse her of hypocrisy over that advantage \u2013 she\u2019s using a flawed comparison. Sending a child to the local comprehensive is not the equivalent of starving them or selling your home. And not simply because, contrary to the worst myths about state schools, a comprehensive education is not five years of deprivation and misery. (I doubt very much Chakrabarti believes that). It\u2019s because throwing your family\u2019s dinner in the bin, or swapping your five-bedroom townhouse for a council flat, is entirely fruitless. Your son not being able to eat does not make someone else\u2019s less hungry. Your daughter not having her own room does not allow someone else\u2019s to have a bed.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/22/broad-social-mix-school-benefited-pupils-not-grammar\">My school\u2019s broad social mix benefited all pupils. I\u2019m glad it wasn\u2019t a grammar | Poppy Noor</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But resisting sending your child to a selective school \u2013 whether that\u2019s through the 11-plus or private fees \u2013 does really improve the education of other people\u2019s less-advantaged children. <a href=\"http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/2/7/45002641.pdf\" title=\"\">Research shows</a> that articulate, confident, able classmates are the greatest source of help for other pupils. Similarly, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2010/oct/29/middle-class-children-better-school\" title=\"\">middle-class parents</a> who can use their time, influence and experience do wonders for their local school. Put bluntly, when people like Chakrabarti siphon their kids into grammars and private schools, they weaken the comprehensive system. Yes, the exact system they advocate.</p> <p>This isn\u2019t about criticising individual parents or a sanctimonious need for political purity. But recognising that each time a vocal supporter of non-selective education opts for a grammar or private school for their own child, it damages the wider argument. It doesn\u2019t matter that Labour\u2019s opposition to selective education is based on evidence of what actually helps the majority of people\u2019s children. The public won\u2019t have faith in the comprehensive system if politicians, peers and campaigners don\u2019t.</p> <p>It\u2019s the smell of hypocrisy of so-called out-of-touch elites that turns voters off politics: one rule for me and another for you. Right or wrong, that\u2019s even more the case when you\u2019re talking about the need for a fair and equal education, when you\u2019re trying to make the case for a society that cares about the life chances of all children, not just our own.</p> <p>If the left really wants to win the argument for equality, it can\u2019t publicly argue for collective responsibility and privately duck out in the name of individualism. Chakrabarti has reminded Labour of an ongoing lesson. Words are easy. Actions are altogether more difficult.</p>",

More than 1,000 writers sent in work to be considered for the event, with 50 chosen by a panel of editors to attend.

Applications are now open for another #WriteNow event <a href=\"http://www.write-now.live/birmingham-1/\">in Birmingham on 26 November</a>, with a <a href=\"http://www.write-now.live/manchester-1/\">Manchester event scheduled for 4 February 2017</a>.

I don\u2019t think we realised we had a problem 10-15 years ago, but now we do \u2026 When a publisher has a bestseller, it\u2019s easy to [just keep publishing] what sold yesterday.

The US has probably the most intensive screening process in the world for refugees: it requires they register and interview with the United Nations, which then must refer them to the US; refugees who pass this test then interview with state department contractors and have at least two background checks; then they have three fingerprint and photo screenings; then US immigration reviews the case; then homeland security interviews the refugee; then a doctor examines the refugee; and finally several security agencies perform one last check after the refugee has been matched with a resettlement agency. </p> <p>The process <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/02/donald-trump-syria-refugees-us-immigration-security-terrorism\">takes 18 months</a> to two years.

Another <a href=\"http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/publications/analysis-donald-trumps-tax-plan\">analysis, by the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center</a>, warned that without severe spending cuts, the plan would balloon national debt \u201cby nearly 80% of gross domestic product by 2036, offsetting some or all of the incentive effects of the tax cuts\u201d.</p> <h2><strong>\u2018[The US is] just about the highest taxed country in the word\u2019</strong></h2> <p>For months, Trump falsely claimed that the US is one of the highest-taxed countries in the world; he later adjusted to a more specific and more correct claim, about corporate tax rates. The US corporate income tax rate does rank among the highest among industrialised nations, <a href=\"https://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=TABLE_II1\">according to the Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD)</a>. But Trump\u2019s claim doesn\u2019t take into account deductions and other exemptions \u2013 the kind that helped <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/markets/2016/03/07/27-giant-profitable-companies-paid-no-taxes/81399094/\">General Motors and dozens of other corporations escape paying any taxes</a> in recent years.</p> <h2><strong>\u2018The vacuum they\u2019ve left, that\u2019s why Isis started in the first place\u2019</strong></h2> <p>Trump is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/09/donald-trump-fact-check-lies-military-tax-returns\">pretending that he has always supported a residual American force in Iraq</a>. The businessman actually called for a complete withdrawal from Iraq, even in the event of continued civil war or authoritarian violence there. </p> <p>\u201cYou know how they get out? They get out. That\u2019s how they get out. Declare victory and leave,\u201d he <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0703/18/le.01.html\">told CNN</a> in 2007. \u201cThis is a total catastrophe, and you might as well get out now because you\u2019re just wasting time and lives.\u201d</p> <p>The argument that Isis rose out of the vacuum of post-withdrawal Iraq also ignores that its first forms began during that country\u2019s civil war, while George W Bush was in office, and that the terror group concentrated its powers in Syria\u2019s civil war long before Obama began a bombing and special-forces campaign there.</p> <h2><strong>Look at what she did in Libya with Gaddafi, Gaddafi\u2019s out, it\u2019s a mess</strong></h2> <p>Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump all supported intervention in Libya in 2011. None supported occupation to \u201cbuild democracy\u201d there in the model of George W Bush\u2019s invasion and occupation of Iraq.</p> <p>Trump is lying about his opposition to intervention in Libya. Like Clinton, he supported military strikes, saying in <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/andrewkaczynski/trump-claims-he-didnt-support-libya-intervention-but-he-did?utm_term=.cxLgP37W3#.je5XJqPgq\">a February 2011 video blog</a> that the US should take \u201cimmediate\u201d action against dictator Muammar Gaddafi. \u201cWe should go in, we should stop this guy, which would be be very easy and very quick.

She did say the \u201cgold standard\u201d but she said she didn\u2019t say it\u2019</strong></h2> <p>Clinton has not been consistent on the Trans-Pacific Partnership, and her language from 2010 through 2014 suggests she was broadly in support of Barack Obama\u2019s trade deal. </p> <p>As secretary of state in 2012, <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-pol-trade-tpp-20160926-snap-story.html\">she said</a>: \u201cThis TPP sets the gold standard in trade agreements to open free, transparent, fair trade, the kind of environment that has the rule of law and a level playing field.

Officials did repeatedly ask for more security, but Congress found no evidence that those claims made it to Clinton\u2019s desk.</p> <h2><strong>\u2018There is a thing called clean coal. Coal will last for 1,000 years in this country \u2026 we have found tremendous wealth under our feet in this country\u2019</strong></h2> <p>Trump appears to be conflating the national gas boom of the last 15 years with so-called \u201cclean coal\u201d, which arguably does not exist, <a href=\"http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2014/04/coal/nijhuis-text\">given the high carbon emissions of coal energy</a>.

Senators Ted Kennedy and Orrin Hatch, a Democrat and Republican, led the effort in Congress and passed the CHIP healthcare program in a budget bill after the first lady\u2019s efforts to lead a broader healthcare reform bill failed. Clinton tried to claim credit for the program during her failed 2008 campaign for president, and at the time Kennedy <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/10/05/AR2007100501343_pf.html\">gave great credit</a> to her for efforts.

But the story is much larger than these terms.</p> <p>Russia was already within limits in two categories before the treaty was signed, in 2011; the treaty does not affect undeployed or retired weapons; and Russia has reduced its nuclear arms more slowly in the last decade than it did while George W Bush and Bill Clinton were in the White House. Nor does the treaty prevent countries from stockpiling weapons.

What, a pair of Aryan-blond brothers whose <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biee_H-mDgk\">debut single</a> was a Warhol-worthy disquisition on the imminence \u2013 not to mention <a href=\"http://www.dictionary.com/browse/immanence\">immanence</a> \u2013 of celebrity? Not interesting enough for you? Apart from their immaculate, perfectly postmodern image, there was their thrillingly hypercute Michael Jacksonesque pop. Those first four singles!

Pertinently, they have just issued their fourth fine single on the bounce. I\u2019m in Love With My Best Friend was the one that introduced this east London trio earlier this year, to Kamio\u2019s effortless warble and Paul Taylor Wade and Simon Milner\u2019s deceptively pleasant late-night balladtronica. Deceptive because Taylor Wade and Milner\u2019s gentle sonics and glossy productions barely disguised Kamio\u2019s art of darkness. Because there she was, on second single Diseasey, her honeyed coo hovering above the lightly throbbing beat, sighing ominously about \u201cthe teeth dying in my mouth\u201d as she told a tale of marital deceit that found her declaring, \u201cI\u2019m into your sickness\u201d and demanding that her lover \u201cinfect me with your weakness\u201d. </p> <p>\u201cSimon and Paul are very good at encouraging me to be confident in what I have to say,\u201d Kamio tells us. There\u2019s something jolting about her choice of language in the seemingly mellifluous context, with its references to \u201ckiss[ing] your husband on the neck\u201d and his \u201ctouch being diseasey\u201d. The word \u201cbint\u201d \u2013 probably last deployed in a public sphere in an episode of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2013/feb/14/the-sweeney-box-set\">The Sweeney</a> \u2013 is especially jarring.</p> <p>\u201cThat was my mum,\u201d Kamio explains. \u201cMy dad cheated on her and the word she used to describe the woman was a \u2018bint\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>Fair enough. What does her mother make of S\u00e4len\u2019s music?</p> <p>\u201cShe likes it, although she didn\u2019t like <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2EdGEqbwSQ0\">the Diseasey video</a>. She thought it was a cumshot.\u201d</p> <p>Beg pardon?</p> <p>\u201cYou know \u2013 a cumshot. There was a comment underneath the video on YouTube that said, \u2018Porn video \u2013 I hate.\u2019 That was our favourite. </p> <p>\u201cIt was meant to be vomit,\u201d she adds of the glutinous liquid dribbling down her face at the start of the promo. How about the blood-red stuff that follows? \u201cOh, that\u2019s medicine and edible glitter.\u201d</p> <p>The third single, The Drwg \u2013 young people today with their idiosyncratic orthography \u2013 is their best yet, with its pristine pulse, aching chord sequence and portents of the unpleasant things that people do in the name of love.<strong> </strong>\u201cNobody makes me feel as good as you do,\u201d Kamio breathily intones. \u201cNo one can make me do the things that I do when I\u2019m with you.\u201d The chorus is an insidiously pretty killer: \u201cYou\u2019re the drug that I\u2019m in love with / You\u2019re the way that I waste my time.\u201d Been listening to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7oQEPfe-O8\">REM\u2019s The One I Love</a> lately, have we?</p> <p>\u201cI do know that song,\u201d she admits. \u201cBut it didn\u2019t influence me. I just wrote down loads of things that relate to being in love.\u201d </p> <p>Single No 4 \u2013 and the one that puts them in the Bros bracket \u2013 is Copper Kiss. As with its predecessors, it nails its colours to the deliciously tuneful/lyrically poisonous duality. This really is a litany of lacerating imagery: \u201cLet\u2019s bite until our lips are split \u2026 You\u2019re so gross you make me sick \u2026 I\u2019ll lose your taste with my spit \u2026 When you crack your bones I hope they snap in half.\u201d</p> <p>What\u2019s it all about?</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t really know,\u201d she replies. \u201cBiting someone when you\u2019re kissing them cos you don\u2019t really like them.\u201d Then why kiss them? \u201cEveryone has needs. I was being a bit sassy \u2013 in a brutal way. People say our music is quite pretty in some ways, with soft vocals, but the lyrics are very dark.\u201d</p> <p>S\u00e4len are named after a town in Sweden (\u201cWe threw a dart at a map and that\u2019s where it landed\u201d) and are doing well on <a href=\"http://swedishstartupspace.com/2016/04/12/spotify-founders-threaten-to-move-from-sweden-in-open-letter/\">Spotify</a> \u2013 Diseasey is fast approaching 1.5m streams, which you might like to know is more than any Bros single apart from that epochal debut. We went to see them in June at a venue in London called Birthdays but couldn\u2019t get in, such was the queue around the block. People like S\u00e4len. But do S\u00e4len like people?</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m a feminist, but not a feminazi,\u201d Kamio says. \u201cI love men.\u201d</p> <p>She\u2019s less keen on Taylor Swift. </p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s meant to be the golden girl of pop, but she\u2019s so boring.

  "<h2>1) Saracens won\u2019t be daunted by Toulon test</h2> <p>Saracens will begin the defence of their European title this week with every reason to be cheerful. Toulon may not have lost a European Cup tie on home turf but they will have to dig particularly deep to crack the toughest current challenge on the continent. Sarries have conceded just four tries in their six Premiership games, remarkable even by their standards and even more impressive given the absence of key backline figures such as Owen Farrell, Alex Goode, Duncan Taylor and Chris Ashton. \u201cWe put them under a lot of pressure,\u201d said a delighted Mark McCall, after watching his side complete their bonus point win over Wasps at Allianz Park. \u201cFor us to have played the first six league games and won five without Owen, Duncan and, latterly, Alex and Chris is a good achievement. I don\u2019t think Toulon have ever lost a European Cup match at home so it\u2019s a good challenge for us but, regardless of that, we\u2019ve got to fight and scrap for everything.\u201d <strong>Robert Kitson</strong></p> <ul> <li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/09/saracens-wasps-premiership-match-report\">Match report: Saracens 30-14 Wasps</a></li> </ul> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2016/oct/08/european-champions-cup-saracens-toulon\">Saracens take steady approach to Europe as Premiership clubs look to dominate</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>2) Jones shows true colours with ink now dry</h2> <p>Eddie Jones was at the Stoop before going over the road to spy on Argentina and Australia before England\u2019s fixtures against them in the autumn series at the end of a week when he had, for the first time, not just ruffled Premiership feathers but plucked a good few. The December date with the Wallabies will mark Jones\u2019s first anniversary as England\u2019s head coach, and while in the first part of his reign, he was respectful to the clubs he has, since the signing of the new agreement between Premiership Rugby and Twickenham, become more critical and analytical. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/08/harlequins-northampton-premiership-match-report-adam-jones\">There would have been little in a match between two clubs in the bottom half</a> of the table to enthuse him. It was high on energy but low on skill with Northampton again struggling to make an impression against opponents who did not miss many first-up tackles. They were especially wasteful on turnover possession, and while Jones has been criticised by the clubs for beasting his England players at a training camp in Brighton last week, he does not appear to see the Premiership as a vehicle to close the gap on New Zealand. Now that the deal is secure in a filing cabinet, a coach renowned for his single-mindedness is likely to become more and more spiky. The club and international worlds will collide with greater frequency. <strong>Paul Rees</strong></p> <ul> <li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/08/harlequins-northampton-premiership-match-report-adam-jones\">Match report: Harlequins 20-9 Northampton</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/08/northampton-saints-rugby-louis-picamoles-champions-cup\">Picamoles beefs up Northampton for French test against Montpellier</a><br></li> </ul>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2a732d20ec57665cee176b1d6179bbc7f0b42357\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2a732d20ec57665cee176b1d6179bbc7f0b42357/0_227_3656_2193/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Marland Yarde\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Marland Yarde in action for Harlequins against Northampton at The Stoop, where Eddie Jones was in the crowd.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matthew Impey/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>3) Bristol playing catch-up by half-time too often</h2> <p>To play the perfect 80 minutes is the quest of every team. And it never ends, because nobody has managed it. Still, Bristol\u2019s quest has further to go than most. All teams struggle to maintain intensity for a full match, and success is often determined by the degree to which they limit the damage in those off periods. Bristol are being killed by theirs. The temptation is to tut and ask why they didn\u2019t play in the first half, say, the way they did in the second, as if they had wilfully chosen not to. When the score reads 19-0 at the break, as it did here, the dynamic of a match changes. However much the winning side demand of each other that they maintain intensity, they know they have that cushion, which creates just a little space for the losing side to mount a comeback, if they have the requisite spirit. It\u2019s not looking good for Bristol, seven points adrift of the rest, but the good news is that they seem to have that spirit. Also, they have gathered away bonus points against teams they might consider within reach and have not yet played any at home. The bad news is that to be so often beaten in the first half, when everything is equal, hints at a simple deficit in ability. <strong>Michael Aylwin</strong></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/08/northampton-saints-rugby-louis-picamoles-champions-cup\">Louis Picamoles beefs up Northampton for French test against Montpellier</a> </p> </aside>  <ul> <li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/08/newcastle-bristol-premiership-match-report\">Match report: Newcastle 19-14 Bristol</a></li> </ul> <h2>4) Blackadder\u2019s plan gives Bath more belief</h2> <p>The irony of Bath\u2019s convincing 30-3 victory on Friday night was that they will be playing only in the European Challenge Cup this weekend while the Sharks mix it with the big fish in the Champions\u2019 Cup. Sale will not progress very far if they are as one-paced as they were at the Rec and Steve Diamond\u2019s non-appearance at the post-match press conference told its own story. The abiding memory of the evening, though, was the fresh belief visible within Bath ranks, for which their new director of rugby, Todd Blackadder, deserves much credit. Blackadder clearly has a keen rugby brain and a half-decent plan - if he had a different surname it would be permissible to use the word cunning - but his humility is his most striking quality. Bath are enjoying their rugby again and the difference that makes is enormous. <strong>RK</strong></p> <ul> <li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/07/bath-sale-premiership-rugby-union-match-report\">Match report: Bath 30-3 Sale</a></li> </ul> <h2>5) Tait\u2019s injury-free run testament to the Tigers</h2> <p>Richard Cockerill\u2019s assertion after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/08/leicester-worcester-premiership-match-report\">his side\u2019s comfortable win over Worcester</a> that Leicester have been dealing with players returning from international duty injured for 20 years, when asked about England\u2019s recent training camp, struck a chord. \u201cThey come back injured and we look after them,\u201d was his matter of fact statement and while Mathew Tait has not played for England since arriving at Welford Road in 2011, the Tigers\u2019 have most certainly looked after him, restoring him to long-term fitness after a remarkable run of injuries. Before those injuries deprived him of that extra yard of pace Tait was one of those players worth the admission fee. Some speedsters thunder across the turf, Tait glided with effortless grace and he has reinvented himself as the most reliable of Leicester players, at either full-back or inside-centre. He made 26 appearances last season and has played every minute of this campaign, impressing against Worcester with sharp hands, leaving the fireworks to Tonga\u2019s Telusa Veainu but showing just a glimpse or two of that ability to glide.

Shortly before kick-off, Billy Burns and Gareth Evans joined Henry Purdy and John Afoa in Gloucester\u2019s ranks of the injured \u2013 in the same week in which their former prop and record appearance maker Nick Wood was forced to retire through injury. None of these, you might have noticed, was probably on Jones\u2019s radar. Manu Tuilagi, Dylan Hartley, Owen Farrell ... the list of this Premiership casualties is far too long to be exhaustive in a brief talking point. \u201cEngland seemed to have loaded him more than we would have done,\u201d said Baxter of Nowell, while Saracens\u2019 Mark McCall said earlier in the week that he was flabbergasted that England arranged a camp less than two weeks before the start of the Champions Cup. The evidence suggests though, Rob and Mark, that it is those above Jones and away from the England team that have more to answer for. <strong>Dan Lucas</strong></p> <ul> <li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/08/exeter-gloucester-premiership-match-report\">Match report: Exeter 27-27 Gloucester</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/08/exeter-rob-baxter-jack-nowell-england-eddie-jones\">Exeter\u2019s Baxter slams England training camp after Nowell injury</a></li> </ul>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e8aff27d454e5f91a818b44d017bf849c8c2b38c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e8aff27d454e5f91a818b44d017bf849c8c2b38c/725_42_2676_1606/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Exeter\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Exeter players celebrate after Damian Welch\u2019s last-gasp try earned them a draw against Gloucester.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Rogers/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>7) Could Leinster provide a strong Irish challenge in the Champions Cup?</h2> <p>This season\u2019s Champions Cup could do with a strong Irish challenger and Leinster definitely look a team on the up. Not everything they did came off in a high-intensity 25-14 victory against Munster but there was enough promise from their young centre Garry Ringrose and scrum-half Luke McGrath to hint at brighter times ahead. Johnny Sexton also looks to be in a better place fitness-wise and they share the same pool as Northampton, currently flattering to deceive in the Premiership. It was interesting, too, to see Stuart Lancaster laying down the law in the dressing room at half-time while Leo Cullen, the director of rugby, stood silently beside him. Lancaster has an excellent record when it comes to developing young talent and England\u2019s loss may yet turn out to be Irish rugby\u2019s gain. <strong>RK</strong></p> <ul> <li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/09/australia-michael-cheika-bring-edge-european-tour-argentina\">Cheika confident Australia will have edge on European tour</a></li> </ul>",

Trump was a rambling, lying, nasty mess, who looked tired and dejected for much of the first half of the debate.</p> <p>Polls for CNN and YouGov seem to suggest Clinton won, whilst in focus group terms, the Luntz focus group favoured Trump, but the CNN focus group favoured Clinton.

  "<p>It wasn\u2019t the constant stress of lying about the whereabouts of her husband, the relentless police interrogations or being vilified as a liar on newspaper front pages around the world that almost broke <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2007/dec/05/matthewweaver\">Anne Darwin</a>.</p> <p>That moment came in the split second when she saw for herself the damage her five-year pretence that John had been swept out to sea in a canoe had done to her relationship with her two sons.</p> <p>\u201cAfter the truth came out that we\u2019d been living in Panama together, I continually wrote to Mark and Anthony to say: \u2018I am so sorry.

It is also a love letter to her children.</p> <p>It is a book she says she wrote to help herself \u2013 and her sons \u2013 understand why she went along with their father\u2019s plan to fake his own death \u2013 Reggie Perrin-style \u2013 and claim the life-insurance money.</p> <p>But while Anne paid for her crimes with a three-a-half-year prison sentence, the emotional debts left by betrayal are much harder to repay.</p> <p>While anyone who reads the book can see that John Darwin had all the traits of a narcissistic personality disorder \u2013 grandiose behaviour, fantasies of success, and lack of empathy \u2013 the burning question has always been what role did Anne, a previously devoted mother, play in all this?</p> <p>Was she a willing accomplice who happily went along with the deceit so the couple could escape their mounting debts of \u00a3700,000 to start an exotic new life in Panama?</p> <p>Or was she a woman whose failed defence of \u201cmarital coercion\u201d should have been taken more seriously? Especially as in the nine years since her guilty verdict for 15 counts of fraud and money laundering, emotional abuse between spouses has become recognised as an offence in its own right.</p> <p>Certainly when you talk to Anne, it\u2019s hard to tell whether her unflinching gaze is due to the fact she no longer has anything to hide or is a hint of the inner core of steel that enabled her to front the most notorious financial scam of the decade.</p> <p>Yet Anne insists the quiet confidence she has today is down to the grit she developed from being in jail where she was incarcerated alongside serial killers such as Rose West, and having to rebuild her life since her <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/mar/09/anne-darwin-released-canoe-disappearance\">release in 2011</a>.</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t always that way, she says. Fifteen years ago, she would never have had the confidence to talk like this. John would have been glued to her side and he wouldn\u2019t have let her get a word in edgewise.</p> <p>Indeed, the reason she says she gave in to John\u2019s schemes in the first place was that she believed him when he told her she would never cope on her own, a belief he fostered by belittling her throughout their 37-year marriage.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"70dbadf30ed4284822120498db98524ed27cc176\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/70dbadf30ed4284822120498db98524ed27cc176/0_0_2467_1773/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Anne and John Darwin in 2008.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"719\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Anne and John Darwin in 2008.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PA Wire</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Anne had been just 17 when they first started dating. John, self-assured, clever and already training to be a teacher, kept asking her out at the shop where she worked, and wouldn\u2019t take no for answer. She was already in awe of him and he was already getting her to do what he wanted. \u201cHe always asked for sweets from the top shelf, knowing I would have to climb a ladder to get them.\u201d</p> <p>But he could be entertaining and romantic and when he asked her to marry him at 21, she agreed.</p> <p>In 1975 and 1978, their two sons, Mark and Anthony, were born \u2013 and Anne loved motherhood. But while there were never any threats or physical violence, John became increasingly overbearing.</p> <p>\u201cEarly on, I knew that I would be fighting a losing battle if there was anything to discuss. John always had the counter-argument so there was no point disagreeing. He always got his way.\u201d</p> <p>All this might have gone unnoticed but for John\u2019s pathological need to impress, which led him to try to build an empire out of rental properties in run-down mining communities. When he borrowed too much and they could not find tenants to pay the rents, the debts spiralled out of control. When he started coming up with his outlandish scheme to fake his own death and claim the insurance, Anne said there was nothing she could say to deter him.</p> <p>So, given the choice between a man who manipulated her and the two sons she adored, why did she choose the husband? Why didn\u2019t she walk away?</p> <p>Anne says: \u201cEven as a child, I had low self-esteem. I was the kind of girl who wouldn\u2019t put her hand up in class even if she knew the right answer.</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t have the courage to do the right thing because I put all my trust in the man I married and could not perceive a life without him.\u201d</p> <p>Perhaps if the boys been living at home that might have been different, says Anne. \u201cBy the time this happened, they were adults. They had set out on their own independent lives. We maybe saw each other every couple of months.\u201d</p> <p>Clearly, she underestimated the effect it would have on the boys.</p> <p>\u201cJohn could also be persuasive. He told me: \u2018I\u2019ll only need to vanish for a couple of weeks and we\u2019ll have the money.\u2019 It got out of control.</p> <p>\u201cThe deeper you get into these situations, the harder it is to get out. If I had any inkling it would have lasted more than few a weeks, there\u2019s no way I could have gone along with it and put myself through years of torture. But once it was done, and he got me to lie that he\u2019d disappeared, I couldn\u2019t get out of it.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"0f0eb729e8eeb53670c8d78617b90a8d5e4a8bf0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0f0eb729e8eeb53670c8d78617b90a8d5e4a8bf0/0_113_2291_2863/800.jpg\" alt=\"Mark (right) and Anthony Darwin leaving court after giving evidence against their mother.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mark, right, and Anthony Darwin leaving court after giving evidence against their mother.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Furlong/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For four years, Anne helped John to hide in an empty property they owned next to their seafront home Seaton Carew, County Durham. Finally, John hatched a scheme to get a passport in the name of a dead baby and they moved to South America to live more openly. Anne kept up the charade by telling the boys that as a widow, she needed to start a new life.</p> <p>But when a <a href=\"http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/500k-recovered-wife-canoe-fraudster-684683\">picture showing Anne and John together in a Panama estate agent\u2019s office</a> surfaced on the internet four years after he had \u201cdied\u201d, the couple\u2019s lies were exposed.</p> <p>Already John had returned to the UK to claim that he had amnesia. It left Anne to admit she had been carrying on this elaborate pretence all along.</p> <p>After the years of subterfuge, for Anne it was a relief to be able to be honest with her sons again. But for the boys, the betrayal was so sustained, and so humiliating, they publicly said they never wanted to see their mother again.</p> <p>In one shattering interview, Anthony said: \u201cDad told one nasty lie and disappeared \u2026 but she lied for six years. She kept on lying even when the evidence was so overwhelmingly against her. She dragged us through hell by forcing a court case. Her maternal instincts didn\u2019t kick in for a second to protect us.\u201d</p> <p>Even though their father had hatched the plan, Anne has committed the cardinal sin of failing them as a mother. Mark went one step further, saying: \u201cThe mother I had respected and loved all my life seemed to have been transformed into a hideous, lying bitch who had gone to outrageous lengths to con us.\u201d</p> <p>To Anne, trying to survive in prison, reading those words was a moment of utter despair. \u201cA friend tried to hide the story from me and kept it in her cell for me to read when I was ready. Finally the next day, I managed to look at it. It took me two or three goes to read it through. I thought there was no coming back.\u201d</p> <p>A deeply religious woman with a strong Catholic faith that sustained her through her prison term, all Anne could do was pray for the boys to change their minds.</p> <p>Indeed, Anne has never been anything but honest about the reasons she went along with it. In the book she repeatedly refers to her \u201cterrible, unforgivable lies\u201d \u2013 and while she bitterly regrets what she did, she says she holds no one but herself responsible for going along with it.</p> <p>Then on 14 August 2008, Anne was called to the prison office where she was handed an envelope. She instantly recognised the writing as Mark\u2019s. \u201cI feared so much for what was in it. It wasn\u2019t a long letter. It just said he was thinking of me and he would write soon.\u201d</p> <p>It was the redemption she had craved. At this point in our interview the tears come and it takes a moment before she can continue. \u201cThen in the next letter that came, he asked if he could come and see me.\u201d</p> <p>Soon after, Anthony, too, promised to write, though it was several heart-stopping months before the letter finally arrived.</p> <p>\u201cI remember sitting in the visiting room just watching Mark and his wife walking towards me. He was still angry. All I could say was: \u2018I\u2019m sorry.\u2019 It was a long time before my apologies were accepted. But there was a short hug at the end \u2013 but at least it was something \u2013 some physical contact. I just hoped they would come back.\u201d</p> <p>Yet it took therapy sessions for Anne to finally understand the hold John had over her.</p> <p>\u201cI hadn\u2019t realised how much John manipulated me until I was in prison. I had to see a psychologist to finally help me see things in a different light.</p> <p>\u201cUntil then I\u2019d always had his voice in my head. Finally, when it faded away, I could then make decisions for myself and I realised that I didn\u2019t have to depend on him. I could cope on my own. The last spark of love faded when I was removed from his influence.\u201d</p> <p>The last time Anne spoke to John was just before his release from prison.</p> <p>\u201cIt was the phone call in which I told him that I didn\u2019t want to live with him any more. He was still belligerent, saying we should still to be together. But I said: \u2018No, I\u2019m sorry. That\u2019s not what I want.\u2019 That was the first time I\u2019d stood up to him and said no.\u201d</p> <p>When, on her release in 2011, John sent Anne a photograph of herself branded with a copyright symbol \u2013 to imply she was still his property \u2013 she also took out an injunction, forbidding contact. She laughs when she recalls how it was John who finally divorced her on the grounds of \u201cunreasonable behaviour\u201d. Does she think he ever loved her? Anne says despite her protestations, she doubts he really did.</p> <p>Now all she knows about him is the newspaper stories that say he is living in the Philippines with a new wife. But his whereabouts are of no interest to her. Does she know if Mark and Anthony are in touch with him? \u201cThat\u2019s a private matter for them.\u201d</p> <p>Now Anne lives the independent life John told her she could never have. She has used the IT and business qualifications she earned in prison to get a job working for the RSPCA. Home is a small but comfortable flat in a pretty village just a few miles outside York.</p> <p>She and the boys are reconciled now. She has been on holidays with their families and expects to spend Christmas with them too. Last year for her 63rd birthday, she had the only thing she ever wanted \u2013 calls from both sons, wishing her a happy birthday.</p> <p>Set aside are two copies of the book for the boys, with a personal inscription. Anne admits she does not know if they will ever read them, but they are there if they need to understand more.</p> <p>She does not expect total forgiveness \u201cbecause what I did was an unforgivable thing\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cBut now I feel a sense of relief it\u2019s all out there. There\u2019s nothing else left for me to say. A line has been drawn under it. I want to live for today and look forward to tomorrow. I\u2019m sure many people will wonder whether I really deserve a second chance. Mark and Anthony decided I did, and to me that\u2019s the only thing that matters.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 <em>Out of my Depth by Anne Darwin with David Leigh is published by Mirror Books for \u00a38.99.

  "<p>Facebook\u2019s UK business generated an \u00a311.3m tax credit last year, despite the world\u2019s largest social network making a global profit of $6.19bn (\u00a34.97bn), according to <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/06331310/filing-history/MzE1OTA5MTk5OGFkaXF6a2N4/document?format=pdf&amp;download=0\">the latest company accounts</a>.</p> <p>The credit at Facebook UK Ltd can be offset against future tax bills and is likely to raise further questions about whether the $370bn US company is paying its fair share towards Britain\u2019s public finances.</p> <p>Last week, the prime minister, Theresa May, told the Conservative party conference: \u201cIf you\u2019re ... an international company that treats tax laws as an optional extra \u2026 I\u2019m putting you on warning. This can\u2019t go on any more.\u201d</p> <p>Until April, all Facebook\u2019s UK advertising sales were routed through its operations in Dublin, reducing the UK tax bill. Activities at Facebook UK, meanwhile, were confined to selling \u201csales support, marketing services and engineering support\u201d to other companies within the Facebook group.</p> <p>But in that month, Facebook\u2019s UK sales activity was transferred from Dublin to London, following the then chancellor George Osborne\u2019s introduction of a <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/mar/18/osborne-targets-multinationals-and-tax-evaders-in-budget-crackdown\">punitive rate of tax</a> for multinationals deemed to be artificially shifting British sales overseas.</p> <p>Ahead of the change, turnover at Facebook UK Ltd doubled in 2015 to \u00a3210m, but this did not include a penny of the hundreds of millions of pounds in sales income that the wider group is estimated to have received from British advertisers.</p> <p>Losses for Facebook UK increased from \u00a328.5m to \u00a352.5m in 2015. As a result, the accounts showed that Facebook UK ended the year with a tax credit of \u00a311.3m, compared with a <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2015/oct/11/facebook-paid-4327-corporation-tax-despite-35-million-staff-bonuses\">tax bill of \u00a34,327</a> in 2014.</p> <p>The company reported a \u00a34.2m tax charge for 2015, as well as \u00a315.5m of deferred tax credits, linked to staff share awards. Last year, Facebook UK paid employees \u00a371m in share awards.</p> <p>The accounts show that Facebook UK expanded dramatically last year, doubling staff and turnover, in advance of the group <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/mar/04/facebook-pay-millions-more-uk-tax-reports\">abandoning its controversial tax structure</a> for British advertising sales.</p> <p>The number of people working for the business grew from 362 to 682 in 2015, including the addition of 200 staff within its software engineering team. Since then, a spokesman for the company said headcount has grown further, with more than 1,000 people employed by Facebook in the UK.</p> <p>Staff have been taken on in part to help Facebook UK sell advertising directly to major clients, who had previously dealt with Facebook Ireland.</p> <p>In a <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-35724308\">memo to UK staff</a> in March, Facebook said: \u201cOn Monday, we will start notifying large UK customers that from the start of April, they will receive invoices from Facebook UK and not Facebook Ireland.</p> <p>\u201cIn light of changes to tax law in the UK, we felt this change would provide transparency to Facebook\u2019s operations in the UK. </p> <p>\u201cThe new structure is easier to understand and clearly recognises the value our UK organisation adds to our sales, through our highly skilled and growing UK sales team.\u201d</p> <p>As Facebook UK has taken greater control of sales to British customers, it has hired new staff, many of whom are expected to move into its new offices at <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/sep/11/facebook-move-uk-headquarters-london\">One Rathbone Square</a> in central London, when construction is finished next year.</p> <p>These changes mean that Facebook UK\u2019s next set of accounts are likely to show a more dramatic jump in revenues. There is also expected to be an impact on how much UK tax is paid, although a number of factors, including the \u00a311.3m tax credit, could mean that it is some time before Facebook\u2019s UK tax bill rises substantially.</p> <p>In a statement, Facebook said: \u201cWe are proud that in 2015 we have continued to grow our business in the UK and created over 300 new high-skilled jobs ... We pay all the taxes that we are required to under UK law.\u201d</p> <p>In January, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://d1lge852tjjqow.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001326801/0c796377-fba3-4e40-b18a-3503901af1a4.pdf\">Facebook warned US investors</a> in its annual report that the UK operation could face higher tax bills in the future. </p> <p>\u201cMany countries in Europe ... have enacted new laws that could significantly increase our tax obligations \u2026 or require us to change the manner in which we operate our business. For example, in 2015, the United Kingdom enacted the diverted profits tax \u2026 which could increase our tax obligations,\u201d it said.</p> <p>The reaction among large technology companies to Osborne\u2019s <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/385741/Diverted_Profits_Tax.pdf\">diverted profits tax (pdf)</a> has been mixed. Google and eBay believe that they have found a way to continue sending UK sales overseas without falling foul, but Amazon and Facebook have chosen to unwind such arrangements. </p> <p>When he <a href=\"http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-politics-osborne-tech-idUKKCN0HO15N20140929\">first unveiled his efforts</a> to tackle multinational tax avoidance in 2014, Osborne said: \u201cSome technology companies go to extraordinary lengths to pay little or no tax here ... If you abuse our tax system, you abuse the trust of the British people. And my message to those companies is clear: we will put a stop to it.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>I loved the army. It gave me a structure and a sense of camaraderie I will never forget. I could just about deal with the racial abuse I experienced at the beginning of my army career and I came to see it as family. But I wasn\u2019t prepared for the impact those years of service would have on the rest of my life.</p> <p>I served in Northern Ireland and Cyprus. Army life gave me a structure that I think I took for granted at the time and when I left the army I struggled. I don\u2019t know why, but I know what it felt like \u2013 I was like a boat without a sail or a rudder. People talk about the transition from the armed forces to civvy street as if it is always a really smooth process but that\u2019s not true for everyone. It wasn\u2019t for me. </p> <p>I spent some time in Germany. When I returned to England I felt completely lost, like I had no future. I tried a few different jobs but I struggled to adapt.

My behaviour became erratic. Keeping work going was a struggle. I fell out with my wife. Then everything collapsed. I was homeless, camping down in the bin areas of blocks of flats. Getting by on people\u2019s leftovers. Hanging round market stalls for the throwaways at the end of the day. My behaviour was getting more and more out of control and I ended up being sectioned.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/oct/18/collateral-damage-ex-soldiers-living-with-ptsd\">'You don't ever get over it': meet the British soldiers living with post-traumatic stress disorder</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I look at myself now, serving customers at the <a href=\"http://www.stoll.org.uk/about-us/news/veterans-kitchen-open-business/\">Veterans\u2019 Kitchen</a>, running a social enterprise \u2013 and I have to pinch myself.

  "<p>Today\u2019s publishers are no longer just producers of newspapers and magazines. Faced with dwindling circulation and subscriptions and combined with insufficient revenues from online advertising, many publishers have added other strings to their bows \u2013 from membership clubs to global events \u2013 in order to survive. <br></p> <p>One area many are investing in is e-commerce. Several years in the making, Cond\u00e9 Nast has just launched <a href=\"https://www.style.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Style.com</a>, an e-commerce business that\u2019s arguably one of its most significant ventures. Glossy-looking and featuring high-end designer products such as a Chloe zip-front leather jumpsuit and a Paul Smith bomber jacket, Cond\u00e9 Nast has reportedly pumped \u00a375m into the e-tail business and hired fashion heavyweight such as former Browns buying director Yasmin Sewell as fashion director and Galeries Lafayette former head of internet and e-commerce Franck Zayan as president. </p> <p>Fashion fans can shop across the site while those browsing Cond\u00e9 Nast properties such as Vogue.co.uk and GQ.co.uk will be directed to products they\u2019ve just read about. </p> <p>\u201cStyle.com brings added value by connecting the content with the product offer and providing other suggestions of products and brands when they read pieces on Vogue.co.uk or GQ.co.uk,\u201d says Zayan. He views it as an \u201cincredible\u201d new stream of revenue.</p> <p>Unlike many retailers, Cond\u00e9 Nast isn\u2019t holding any stock though \u2013 the fulfilment is handled by the individual brands \u2013 but they do, of course, take a cut of the transaction. </p> <h2>Launching in a competitive luxury market </h2> <p>But in a world where consumers might look for inspiration across magazines then buy via established retailers such as Net-a-Porter and Selfridges, how easy is it going to be to break into this already competitive market? \u201cAs we are going to target the same customers but in a space that is expanding, I\u2019m convinced that we will find our place more easily than any new player could,\u201d says Zayan. \u201cCond\u00e9 Nast already has a massive audience, so our customers are already readers of one or more of our on- and offline publications. They go there for inspiration before they purchase products. What we are doing is bringing all of that together in what I think is a really amazing offer.\u201d </p> <p>Admittedly, the launch of Style.com didn\u2019t get off to the best of starts. A Sunday Times Style magazine article reported that the launch of the Style.com had been delayed and highlighted the lack of top designers on the site. Zayan bats away this criticism. \u201cThe reality is that we are adding brands every single day, so if you come back tomorrow you\u2019ll see even more of both established and upcoming brands. All of that is a process that is built in a long-term perspective and vision.\u201d At the time of writing, the site stocked 170 brands but Cond\u00e9 Nast said it had signed up 350 brands which will drop in the coming weeks. </p> <p>Style.com isn\u2019t the first foray into ecommerce for a publisher, though many don\u2019t pump so much investment into it as Cond\u00e9 Nast has. Many publishers operate third-party stores on their sites and take a cut. Others have a different strategy. Take women\u2019s title Marie Claire, which has partnered with Ocado to launch <a href=\"https://fabled.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Fabled by Marie Claire</a>, a physical store located in central London and an e-tail offer selling over 12,000 beauty and wellness products from brands such as Chanel, Clinique and Yves Saint Laurent. </p> <h2>Giving readers what they want</h2> <p>Justine Southall, managing director fashion &amp; beauty at Marie Claire\u2019s parent company Time Inc UK, says the magazine and Fabled operate separately, with the store having a dedicated editor and team creating bespoke content. However, Southall says they do collaborate. \u201cThe uniqueness of this business model is that the access to content, shared opportunities, market knowledge and intelligence, is much more seamless, and yes the two teams do work closely together.\u201d For instance, if a product written about in the magazine is available in Fabled by Marie Claire then they may tag it as such.<br></p> <p>With these etail ventures, publishers must balance the need for building profits whilst also retaining the trust of their valued readers. For instance, will readers be more than a little skeptical when they discover that a product that\u2019s been raved about in a magazine is one they\u2019re also pushing through its e-commerce site?</p> <p>Zayan admits they need to be careful. \u201cWe will lose the advantage that we have, which is the influence and authority of those brands and we do not want to do that, it would be shooting ourselves in the foot.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe will always maintain a mix of retailers because it is important for variety and choice and of course our integrity,\u201d says Southall. <br></p> <p>Not all publishers\u2019 etail ventures have worked out as planned. In 2014, publisher Mondadori Group launched <a href=\"http://www.graziashop.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Graziashop.com</a> as a marketplace with more than 20,000 designers. However, just over a year after launch several senior members including managing director Richard Hatfied exited the business. In July, the site switched from being a marketplace \u201cto a more sustainable affiliate model\u201d, according to Zeno Pellizzari, general manager of Mondadori International Business. They also licensed the brand to a third party. Pellizzari notes that they\u2019ve learnt some lessons along the way. \u201c[The fashion e-tail market] is highly competitive and requires significant investments to be able to scale.\u201d<br></p> <p>So why are publishers throwing serious bucks at e-tail? It comes at a time when newspapers and magazines are grappling to sustain themselves while simultaneously, the publishing business model is changing. \u201cThe rise of digital, mobile and social media have had two consequences,\u201d says Douglas McCabe, an analyst with Enders. \u201cOn the one hand they have disrupted the funnel as a whole, diluting the role of magazines; and on the other hand they have created opportunities for many organisations \u2013 including magazines \u2013 to occupy many different parts of the shopping funnel, from discovery through to transaction.\u201d He also points to the way retailers try to inspire customers through their magazines \u2013 take Net-a-Porter with Porter magazine.<br></p> <p>\u201cSo everyone is converging in the middle,\u201d says McCabe. \u201cInevitably, all companies underrate the complexity of each other\u2019s business models. Retail is a complex, low-margin business which publishers will find it challenging to thrive in.\u201d </p> <p>So will Style.com survive? Keely Stocker, editor of fashion trade magazine Drapers, says the launch of the store has been \u201cslightly underwhelming\u201d. She adds: \u201cIt launched with less brands than expected although there are still some good names on there.\u201d </p> <p>McCabe says the result looks high-end, well-curated and cleanly designed. \u201cBut competition from e-commerce specialists will remain brutally focused and the digital publishing and e-commerce landscape changes at an extraordinary pace, so the publisher should expect a tough marketplace for the foreseeable future.\u201d </p> <p>For Cond\u00e9 Nast, it\u2019s an investment that they\u2019ll hope will be in vogue for a very long time. </p> <p><strong><em>To get weekly news analysis, job alerts and event notifications direct to your inbox, </em></strong><a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/media/\"><strong><em>sign up free for Media &amp; Tech Network membership</em></strong></a><strong><em>.</em></strong></p> <p><em>All Guardian Media &amp; Tech Network content is editorially independent except for pieces labelled \u201cBrought to you by\u201d \u2013 find out more </em><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/2016/jan/25/content-funding\">here</a></em><em>.</em></p>",

I\u2019m thinking <strong>plebiscite</strong>. I\u2019m thinking <strong>banking behaviour</strong>. I\u2019m thinking <strong>tax threshold legislation</strong>.<br></p> <p>First up, <strong>Pauline Hanson</strong> has told the ABC that she will support the respect for emergency services volunteers bill. This is the so-called CFA bill, which became an issue in the federal election because of a stoush between the Victorian professional firefighters and the volunteers over an enterprise bargaining agreement (EBA). The bill gives emergency service volunteers more power in any EBAs. The government needs nine votes and with four One Nation senators coming across the line, with three <strong>Nick Xenophons, Derryn Hinch </strong>and<strong> Bob Day, </strong>the Coalition appears to be in the clear. </p> <p>As <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/oct/09/labor-poised-to-kill-off-marriage-equality-plebiscite-when-parliament-resumes\">Katharine Murphy reported late yesterday</a>, after um-ing and ah-ing and foot shuffling while still pointing out their vehement opposition, Labor is finally going to decide what to do about the Coalition\u2019s plebiscite bill. This is the legislation which would create a plebiscite on marriage equality. The plebiscite would give an indication of the electorate\u2019s feelings, though its outcome would not bind the parliament or the Coalition to the outcome. At the last sitting, Labor announced it would undergo consultations and those meetings have included both the LGBTI community and church groups who oppose marriage equality. They will take the issue to Tuesday\u2019s party room meeting.</p> <p>While I was sitting in a quiet corner reading a book last week, the bank bosses appeared at the much-vaunted house economics committee hearings set up by the Turnbull government. There was a fair bit of squirming involved but it did not soften the resolve in Labor, the Greens and Independent <strong>Bob Katter</strong> among others for a royal commission. The Greens have already flagged they will be moving for a commission of inquiry this week. I reported on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/25/parliament-could-force-banking-inquiry-despite-hostile-coalition-says-senate-clerk\">this advice</a> from the clerk of the Senate, Rosemary Laing to Greens senator Peter Whish-Wilson in August. Her letter then suggested the parliament could force an inquiry like the one into Lionel Murphy in the 80s. (That one was abandoned due to Murphy\u2019s illness.) The problem for those in favour of a banking royal commission is that it can only be established by executive government, that is the Turnbull government. But a commission of inquiry could be \u2013 according to Laing \u2013 forced by the parliament if their numbers in both houses were there. We shall await developments there.</p> <p>Also on the agenda are income tax cuts. Today, first thing we shall see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/may/03/bracket-creep-changes-in-budget-to-save-500000-from-second-top-marginal-tax-rate\">Scott Morrison\u2019s bracket creep bill</a> in the house again, which:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Amends the Income Tax Rates Act 1986 to <a href=\"http://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Bills_LEGislation/Bills_Search_Results/Result?bId=r5683\">increase the third personal income tax threshold</a> so that the rate of tax payable on taxable incomes from $80,001 to $87,000 for individuals is 32.5%. The Greens are not having a bar of it but Labor supports it so it is done deal. </p> </blockquote> <p>Also around this morning, <strong>Gina Rinehart</strong>, <a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/business/australias-richest-woman-gina-rinehart-buys-two-cattle-stations-20160721-gqb0mh.html\">who has lately gone long in cattle</a>, has thrown her weight behind a $365m bid for the Kidman cattle company, confirmed last night. The Stock and Land has a <a href=\"http://www.stockandland.com.au/story/4216028/rinehart-bids-for-slice-of-kidman/?cs=4582\">version of this story here</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Gina Rinehart\u2019s Hancock Prospecting Pty Ltd, Shanghai CRED Real Estate Stock Co Ltd and S. Kidman &amp; Co Ltd (Kidman) have announced today that they have entered into a Bid Implementation Agreement (BIA) under which a joint venture company Australian Outback Beef Pty Ltd (AOB) owned 67 per cent by Hancock and 33pc by Shanghai CRED has committed to make a takeover offer to acquire the Kidman and Co. </p> <p>In a statement to the media issued by a public relations company acting on behalf of Kidman and Co and Hancock Prospecting, it was revealed the offer was conditional on approval from Australia\u2019s foreign investment regime and Chinese government approvals.</p> <p>It is also conditional on the completion of the divestment of the Anna Creek station and the Peake by Kidman to other Australian grazing interests.</p> </blockquote> <p>So you can see where this parliamentary week is going along at a clip already. And if you think this week is full, next week we have the house sitting and budget estimates \u2026</p> <p>Of course, it will be hard for even the most eventful Australian parliamentary day to compete with the second Clinton-Trump debate after the weekend\u2019s revelations of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/08/john-mccain-donald-trump-sex-boast-tape\">sordid little conversation</a> otherwise dismissed as \u201clocker-room banter\u201d. Get me a bucket. We will have live coverage of this elsewhere on the big G.

  "<p>If <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Donald Trump</a>\u2019s candidacy has taught us anything, it\u2019s that the debate format is easily gamed, and \u2013 the man\u2019s many shortcomings as a potential commander-in-chief notwithstanding \u2013 he is a master of it.</p> <p>Sunday night\u2019s town-hall-style event at Washington University in St Louis was no exception to this rule. Seasoned moderators Anderson Cooper and Martha Raddatz, who had clearly prepared with an eye toward not letting Trump get away with as much nonsense as usual, repeatedly allowed him to pivot away to areas he was comfortable in. Meanwhile, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton\">Hillary Clinton</a>, sometimes a bit too eager to defend herself or display her foreign policy knowledge, enabled Trump by engaging him wherever he went.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/09/presidential-debate-reactions-trump-clinton\">'A Red Bull display of madness': reactions to the Trump-Clinton presidential debate</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Asked for an opinion on the way forward in Aleppo, Trump, who clearly had nothing to say about the war-torn city, merely repeated the word a couple of times, before redirecting the conversation entirely with a non sequitur, \u201cLet me tell you about Mosul.\u201d</p> <p>A similar diversion happened with questions regarding Hillary Clinton\u2019s private email server, which Trump always manages to make a centerpiece of debates. Trump\u2019s threat to use the power of the presidency to prosecute his political rival \u2013 \u201cbecause there\u2019s never been so many lies, so much deception\u201d \u2013 wasn\u2019t strong enough of a statement. He also had to threaten her with incarceration, quipping, when Clinton replied with a comment about how it\u2019s a good thing someone with his temperament is not currently in charge of the law in our country: \u201cBecause you\u2019d be in jail!\u201d</p> <p>When the conversation finally did move on from Clinton\u2019s email scandal, Trump reprimanded the moderator for not following up about the emails, a topic that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/08/clinton-trump-veterans-forum-debate-preview-moderators-elections-2016\">already dominated</a> the commander-in-chief forum in September, an event nominally about foreign policy. As for his repeated insistence that there\u2019s \u201cnever been so many lies\u201d? That isn\u2019t true, according to Politifact, which finds Clinton is an unusually truthful candidate.</p> <p>Not that that\u2019s much of an advantage in our current debate climate.</p> <p>Pithy redirections of substance and reason have resurfaced again and again over the course of the election cycle. It\u2019s become endemic to the way we do debates, as Trump\u2019s rise in the primaries has proved, and it is deleterious to our democracy. We punish the candidates who are honest about what they don\u2019t know (Gary Johnson\u2019s \u201cwhat\u2019s Aleppo\u201d moment comes to mind here), and reward the best bullshitters.</p> <p>In the internet era, and the rise-of-Trump era, society must be able to do better. While it\u2019s important for a potential president to be able to deftly pivot away from uncomfortable questions and set the course of conversation on their terms, these are also the skills of a master propagandist. They are not the most important skills in a leader, who should be able to identify what they don\u2019t know and, in the right context, occasionally admit it.</p> <p>Trump doesn\u2019t bother. Rather he draws blanks in huge areas of policy but he\u2019s never held to account for it, because in debates, as in politics everywhere this year, authenticity is king, even Trump\u2019s authentic disregard for the truth.</p> <p>So it\u2019s hard to say what anyone learned from the second debate, not because it was conspicuously less substantive than previous ones, but because it was presidential debates as usual.</p> <p>The truth, and knowledge specifically, is simply not that valuable in a debate format as it exists; voters are simply unable to evaluate it in the framework provided.</p> <p>Experts and the media learned nothing, but that\u2019s less of an indictment of the system \u2013 they\u2019ve heard it all before. But low-information voters could have learned worse than nothing. As in previous debates and pre-debates, they might have come away from thinking Trump was against the war in Iraq (he wasn\u2019t), that Clinton should have done more to reform healthcare (she never had the relevant job description), and that Clinton was somehow the reason Trump was able to dodge paying federal taxes (everyone who can do it does do it). </p> <p>Why should our democracy\u2019s debate system put an emphasis on spontaneity and authenticity at the expense of truth and knowledge? There has to be something better than this at this late date, whether it\u2019s a real-time fact check displayed on screen, a sidebar of data-informed commentary, prepared videos that are vetted for accuracy and submitted in advance.</p> <p>I doubt that authenticity-loving Americans will go for it, but perhaps the public should reconsider. It\u2019s a format that could benefit Trump as much as it would benefit Clinton \u2013 he would have the advantage of not having a meltdown on stage, as he\u2019s constantly in danger of having. Meanwhile Clinton and the rest of us would hear a whole lot fewer lies.</p> <p>We already know enough about Trump\u2019s temperament from the way he uses his Twitter account, and it would certainly be an improvement on the current situation, which seems to be an exercise chiefly in spreading voter misinformation.</p> <p>But don\u2019t expect Trump to lead the charge to reform presidential debates. As his campaign manager Kellyanne Conway put it shortly after the town-hall style debate drew to a close, it\u2019s \u201ca great format for him\u201d.</p> <p>The entire 2016 presidential election thus far is the proof that she\u2019s right.</p>",
  "<p>In my late twenties I decided to go back to university to study mental health nursing. I am now several months into my first position as a qualified nurse in an acute psychiatric hospital. There are days I question my decision and think: \u201cWhat the hell have I done?\u201d I sometimes feel trapped in a position I have worked so hard to achieve and I wonder if this is to be my life from now on.</p> <p>Before I became a nurse I was a support worker looking after people with learning disabilities. I supported a service user who had physical and communication difficulties and she would fight, bite and scream at staff. However, when we were together we would laugh for hours and we developed an amazing relationship. I realised I had a knack for caring for people who were considered challenging and the whole nursing business escalated from there. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I knew I was entering a challenging yet rewarding career; I just never anticipated how tough it would be</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>When I first started studying to be a nurse, I admit I was naive and unaware of exactly what the role entailed. I was frustrated having a minimum wage job with no hope of climbing the financial or academic ladder and I wanted a future. I wanted to challenge myself intellectually and expand my education, but also be able to afford nice things without stressing about money. Nursing sounded good and I wasn\u2019t getting any younger. </p> <p>I had visions of helping vulnerable people and making a difference \u2013 supporting challenging patients who are hard to care for and who no one else wants to look after. I knew I was entering a challenging yet rewarding career; I just never anticipated how tough it would be.</p> <p>The reality is so much harder than I expected and I often leave work feeling like I want to cry. I do cry. My job can be beautiful and wonderful and so rewarding. Some days I leave work and my face hurts from smiling. I can\u2019t sleep some nights as I am replaying the fantastic conversations I have had with the exciting people I have met. I think about the people I have helped and the little conversations or actions that make such a massive impact to a patient\u2019s life. I get to save lives and make a difference, no matter how small that difference may be and I am so fortunate to be able to do that. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/healthcare-network/2016/sep/15/first-time-nursing-career-cant-do-this\">For the first time in my nursing career, I \u200bthink: I can't do this any more</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The contrast is the tears, the stress, the lack of staff and the inability to help those who desperately need me the most. The loudest patients often get the most attention and the quiet ones who are suffering sometimes get neglected. I wish I could spilt myself into 10 and have 30 hours in day to do what I so desperately want and need to do for my patients but it\u2019s not possible. </p> <p>In any one day I may have a patient swallow razor blades and have to be sent to A&amp;E, only for them to self-harm when they have passed them. I have had patients headbutt walls until they bleed. Psychotic patients attack staff and scream at other patients because they can\u2019t control their mania. Depressed patients cannot leave their bed and have neglected their personal care for days, sometimes weeks. Patients are consumed by their hallucinations and delusions, unable to communicate what their needs are. Staff are exhausted and defeated but we carry on. The staff are amazing but what we have to deal with is unimaginable and there is not enough of us to do it. </p> <p> The cuts have made a dramatic impact on the quality of care we provide. There is never enough staff to effectively care for the patients and both the patients and staff suffer as a consequence. The horrible thing is, the patients see how stressed, tired and busy we are and some don\u2019t like to bother us. It is our job to care for them but they don\u2019t want to burden us with their problems and they see we just don\u2019t have the manpower to care for them. </p> <p>The staff are incredible. We work as a team and support each other because we are going through the same stress together. In the hospital where I work, the support goes right up to the matron and ward managers but their hands are tied. They cannot give us the additional staffing we need as the budget does not allow for it. It feels like it is not safe sometimes. And this is not just in my hospital. Every nurse, healthcare assistant, junior doctor, occupational therapist and social worker I have spoken to says the exact same thing. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/healthcare-network/views-from-the-nhs-frontline/2016/aug/22/fail-patients-job-psychiatric-nurse-nhs-lack-mental-health-beds\">I fail patients in my job as a psychiatric nurse and leave them feeling worse</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There are times I feel burnt out.

Hillary Clinton attacked those same women and attacked them viciously.\u201d</p> <p>He added: \u201cAnd I will tell you that when Hillary brings up a point like that and she talks about words that I said 11 years ago, I think it\u2019s disgraceful, and I think she should be ashamed of herself, if you want to know the truth.\u201d</p> <p>Clinton said his facts were wrong and remarked: \u201cWhen I hear something like that, I am reminded of what my friend, Michelle Obama, advised us all: when they go low, we go high.\u201d</p> <p>Trump brought up Clinton\u2019s deletion of 33,000 emails as secretary of state: \u201cYou ought to be ashamed of yourself.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/10/donald-trump-behind-hillary-clinton-debate-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/56pxc\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2793567\"            data-video-name=\"Trump stands behind Clinton during presidential debate \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"Pool\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57fb8cc1e4b03b4fd4fa5f18\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/10/10/161010TrumpLeer_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/10/10/161010TrumpLeer.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/10/10/161010TrumpLeer_V3.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/10/donald-trump-behind-hillary-clinton-debate-video\">Trump stands behind Clinton during presidential debate</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>He said he would appoint a special prosecutor to investigate her. The tone worsened still further when Clinton, in her response, commented: \u201cIt\u2019s just awfully good that someone with the temperament of Donald Trump is not in charge of the law in our country.\u201d</p> <p>The bombastic tycoon interjected: \u201cBecause you\u2019d be in jail.\u201d</p> <p>Some in the audience burst into applause.

Have you left no sense of decency?\u201d</p> <p>Trump\u2019s aggressive tone, finger jabbing and stalking into Clinton\u2019s personal space, were a masterclass in how to lose the optics.</p> <p>But eventually, when the debate moved on to policy, Trump managed to go on the offensive in a way that eluded him in the first clash, hitting some of the Clinton criticisms that will energise his base. She missed some opportunities to punch back.</p> <p>He also flaunted his superficial knowledge. At one point he parted company with his running mate, Mike Pence, who has raised the prospect of using military force in the Syrian civil war. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/09/donald-trump-women-bill-clinton-sex-scandal-hillary-debate\">Donald Trump goes low by parading women accusing Bill Clinton</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cHe and I haven\u2019t spoken, and I disagree,\u201d Trump said. \u201cSyria is no longer Syria.

  "<p>Let me be abundantly clear: I support New South Wales premier Mike Baird\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/24/greyhound-racing-banned-in-new-south-wales-as-bill-passes-parliament\">ban on the greyhound industry</a>. Greyhound racing relies too heavily on grotesque practices of animal cruelty and results in the needless deaths of too many animals. It is banned in most jurisdictions worldwide. It is a small contributor to the NSW economy. The state would be fine \u2013 indeed better off \u2013 without it.</p> <p>Had I received the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/jul/07/new-south-wales-to-ban-greyhound-racing-from-next-year-after-cruelty-investigation\">McHugh report into greyhound racing</a> I would have come to the same conclusion as Baird, but I would like to think I would have executed it differently. I certainly wouldn\u2019t have popped an announcement to ban an entire industry out there on Facebook as casually as I might <a href=\"http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/tv/nsw-premier-mike-bairds-bachelor-tweets-had-us-in-stitches/news-story/b1abcff1be7d64a63ebb6f4df97d94af\">post comments on the television show The Bachelor</a>. </p> <p>The policy alternative for Baird and the NSW government is to take on responsibility for the greyhound industry \u2013 policing it, cleaning it up, regulating it, and monitoring it. That\u2019s expensive \u2013 financially and politically \u2013 and not worth the effort when the state has much bigger challenges.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/oct/10/greyhound-backdown-would-be-to-save-mike-bairds-skin-says-labor-leader\">Greyhound backdown would be to save Mike Baird's skin, says Labor leader</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But let us also be clear on this: Baird\u2019s ban has been a debacle. He didn\u2019t lay the groundwork for his decision. He didn\u2019t explain it well. He didn\u2019t defend it well. He didn\u2019t bring his own team along with him. </p> <p>The precipitous drop in Baird\u2019s approval ratings \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/newspoll/newspoll-dogs-ban-sends-mike-baird-ratings-into-freefall/news-story/91294495701cb40234d342cabd8c103b\">the largest drop for a state premier</a> in the history of Newspoll \u2013 is being credited to the greyhound racing ban. The ban is only part of the story. Baird\u2019s government has amalgamated councils against communities\u2019 wishes, imposed lock-out laws on Sydney\u2019s licensed venues, under-dosed chemotherapy patients, couldn\u2019t complete the sale of Ausgrid, gassed a newborn to death and seriously harmed another, cut funding for TAFE, wrongly cremated two stillborn babies, oversaw the police operation during the Martin Place siege, advocated for a rise in the GST, and is building a light rail line through Randwick that will reduce public transport capacity. </p> <p>The greyhound ban is the straw that broke the camel\u2019s back. </p> <p>Can Baird execute a backflip on the greyhound ban in better fashion than he imposed it? Here\u2019s what to look for when grading his acrobatic skills: a general guide, if you will, on how to do a political backflip.</p> <h2><strong>1. Try to avoid making a mistake in the first place</strong> </h2> <p>Obvious? Yes. Easy to do? Obviously not.</p> <p>First of all, resist appearing to rush to judgments and conclusions. Politicians think a lot about issues, a lot more than the public does. The public needs and deserves the time the politician had to consider issues and form a view. They need to digest information and react. Surprising the public with a firm decision they weren\u2019t prepared for \u2013 like banning an entire industry (or indeed, the entire 2014 federal budget) \u2013 is rarely going to go well. </p> <p>Second, don\u2019t rush to judgments and conclusions. This is different to appearing to rush. The former is foolish. The latter just appears to be foolish. These are two different things, but they often both lead to the need to backflip.</p> <p>Third, politicians should avoid putting controversial things in concrete quickly: legislation or regulation. It\u2019s all the more humiliating when the backflip comes. </p> <h2><strong>2. Do it fast</strong> </h2> <p>When you get a headache, you take pain relief as soon as possible \u2013 not several days later. The same applies to political pain: waiting only intensifies it. Delaying a backflip also risks looking like dithering. It robs the politician the ability to own the decision. It makes it look like circumstances control the leader, rather than the leader shapes circumstances. </p> <h2><strong>3. Don\u2019t be dragged to it</strong> </h2> <p>Even worse than delaying a backflip is being forced to do it because someone\u2019s job is on the line. It looks cynical, self-serving and not with the community\u2019s best interest at heart. Rather than gaining credit, a backflip in such circumstances can create a loss of respect for abandoning principles for political expediency. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/21/the-greyhound-ban-and-the-working-man-what-exactly-does-working-class-culture-mean\">The greyhound ban and the working man: what exactly does 'working class culture' mean? | Jeff Sparrow</a> </p> </aside>  <h2><strong>4. Give the right people credit</strong> <br></h2> <p>Opponents love a backflip and will take credit. A successful backdown will, at least, give a veneer of credit to one\u2019s own side: the MPs who lobbied for changes, who \u201crepresented their community\u201d by \u201cstanding up for the right outcome\u201d to \u201chelp us achieve the best result possible\u201d. </p> <h2><strong>5. Own it</strong></h2> <p>No point trying to pretend this isn\u2019t a backflip. Everyone can see it. Take credit for being wise enough to listen to others and respond. Be prepared for \u201cwhy did you get this wrong in the first place?\u201d questions and don\u2019t get rattled by them. Have an answer ready, such as \u201ccircumstances demanded had to be taken fast, but now that we\u2019ve had time to work on it we got to a better place.\u201d Or, the old standby, \u201cnew information has come to light\u201d is always an option. Just don\u2019t deny this is a backflip. That\u2019s when the laughter starts.</p> <h2><strong>6. Avoid injury and land smoothly</strong></h2> <p>Just like a gymnastic backflip, a political backflip requires a near-perfect execution and landing in order to be judged successful. There is virtually no room for misspeak or missteps. In particular, know exactly what is going to happen next, how it is going to happen, and when it is going to happen. Otherwise, you just look like you are tumbling around.</p>",

  "<p>A retired policeman who worked for a secretive unit monitoring political protests is suing a trade union over claims that he colluded with an unlawful blacklisting operation that prevented construction workers from getting jobs. </p> <p>In a libel claim lodged in the High Court, Gordon Mills, who worked for five years in the unit, has accused the GMB of defaming him and is claiming up to \u00a310,000 in damages.</p> <p>His legal action is being defended <a href=\"http://www.gmb.org.uk/\">by the GMB</a> which said it had been acting in the public interest. The union said there was \u201ccredible evidence\u201d suggesting that Mills, while he was a police officer, shared information with construction firms which were funding a clandestine blacklist of workers.</p> <p>In 2006, Mills joined the <a href=\"http://www.npcc.police.uk/NationalPolicing/NDEDIU/AboutNDEDIU.aspx\">National Extremism Tactical Co-ordination Unit which gave advice</a> to companies, universities and other organisations that were the objects of protests. </p> <p>He said that after he retired in 2011 after 30 years in the police, he wanted to pursue a career in academia, based on his work in the Metropolitan and Cambridgeshire forces. He became a part-time lecturer at Anglia Ruskin University. </p> <p>The dispute revolves around four statements that were released to the media by the GMB last year, to publicise demonstrations that they were organising across the country against blacklisting. </p> <p>In the statements, the GMB had said they were mounting the demonstrations \u201cto shame 63 construction industry managers named as blacklisters who have yet to come clean and apologise for their actions.\u201d</p> <p>One of the demonstrations was held at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/angliaruskinuniversity\">Anglia Ruskin University</a> as the GMB had said it wanted to \u201cshame Gordon Mills, an ex-Cambridgeshire policeman linked to blacklisting of 3,213 construction workers.\u201d</p> <p>The GMB had said Mills gave a presentation in November 2008 to the Consulting Association, a secret organisation funded by Britain\u2019s largest construction firms. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2009/mar/06/ian-kerr-data-protection\">Compiled in a quiet office: a database that kept union activists out of work</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Consulting Association was shut down in 2009 by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/information-commissioner\">Information Commissioner</a> who discovered <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2009/mar/06/ian-kerr-data-protection\">it had unlawfully compiled a confidential database on the political and employment activities of 3,213 workers. </a></p> <p>The construction firms <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2009/jul/16/companies-warning-trade-union-blacklist\">checked the names of workers applying for jobs through the database and those seemed to be troublesome were refused</a> employment.

  "<p>Be it a pool table in the office, beers on Friday or a nap room, the business world is constantly searching for the next psychological nudge to improve performance. Now, managers are turning to sports psychology to find the answers. This is the thinking behind <a href=\"http://planetk2.com/blog/2016/05/performance-fest-2016/\">Performance Fest</a>, a corporate away day set up by PlanetK2, a group of Team GB psychologists.</p> <p>The day\u2019s events ranged from Brazilian drumming to dance choreography to martial arts sessions. I sat down with Dr Chris Shambrook, a sports psychologist <a href=\"http://www.theargus.co.uk/news/9849745.Brighton_sports_psychologist_coached_Team_GB_s_first_gold_medallists/\">who has worked with the British rowing team for five consecutive Olympic Games</a> (a team that won three gold medals and two silvers at Rio 2016). Here, he explains the lessons that businesses can learn from great athletes.</p> <h2><strong>Get planning</strong></h2> <p>\u201cNothing in high performance is an accident. You\u2019re not going in and waiting to be surprised as to what happens,\u201d Shambrook says. Top-level athletes plan four years ahead, for the next Olympic cycle. They also plan what they are doing every week and every day.</p> <p>Team GB\u2019s rowers don\u2019t wait until after a race to evaluate their performance: a good plan beforehand sets out clear criteria to evaluate after a completed project. \u201cThen it\u2019s very easy for [the coaches] to say afterwards: \u2018How well did we do in each of the things that we set out to do?\u2019\u201d</p> <h2><strong>It\u2019s OK to move the goalposts</strong></h2> <p>Shambrook thinks targets are misused all the time: \u201cGoal-setting is used just because it\u2019s known to be good corporate practice, but if we just give people a hard time when they don\u2019t achieve a goal, that\u2019s not proper goal-setting \u2013 that\u2019s just poor practice.\u201d Instead, objectives should be set as motivators. \u201cIf you set a goal, you\u2019re able to target your energy towards something. So, motivationally, you know where to focus,\u201d he says.</p> <p>And it\u2019s OK to move the goalposts. In sport, \u201cthe right goal is about really committing to something that is going to be a feedback mechanism\u201d. If the targets set are not giving good feedback, change them.</p> <h2>Don\u2019t feel helpless</h2> <p>Wasting time and energy on aspects of your job that make you feel helpless or stressed is a massive demotivator. \u201cIf you look at people who aren\u2019t feeling engaged and motivated, ask them how out of control they feel,\u201d says Shambrook. The chances are the answer will be: \u201cA lot.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Don\u2019t let results get in the way</strong></h2> <p>The sporting world looks like it is totally results-obsessed. But the result only comes after long periods of training, preparation, reflection and repetition. Obsession with results hinders improvement in performance. \u201cPeople in business leave at the end of the day and think: \u2018How much did I get done on my to-do list?\u2019\u201d says Shambrook. \u201cAthletes and coaches leave and think: \u2018How well have I used today to get better at what I need to do?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>It doesn\u2019t stop there. In sport, even if a team doesn\u2019t win, there are usually positives to take from the event. In the end, luck may have played a part in the result, and coaches can still find value in the performance. If an exact target is not hit in business, don\u2019t view the entire project as a failure.</p> <h2><strong>Money is a motivator \u2013 to a point</strong></h2> <p>Most athletes aren\u2019t in it for the money \u2013 and once you get to the top levels you are likely to be earning enough for it to stop meaning as much. \u201cThere\u2019s lots of research that shows that, up to a point, money is a useful motivator \u2013 but after a while it stops having a useful impact,\u201d says Shambrook.</p> <p>So, what <em>does</em> work as an incentive? \u201cRewards that definitely highlight not only what people achieve but also how they achieved it.\u201d Praising specific attributes that contributed to a success can be a more effective motivational tool than cash.</p>",

Those who dare to post critical comments online are increasingly being tracked down and penalised. </p> <p>A <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/video-photos/photo-essay/2016/08/30/walking-minefield\">recent report by Human Rights Watch</a> described how local authorities retaliate against people who show dissatisfaction with the Chechen leadership and its policies. It found that the onslaught against dissent has intensified over the past 18 months, with even the mildest criticism on social media ruthlessly punished through unlawful, punitive detention, enforced disappearances, cruel and degrading treatment, death threats, threats against family members, and physical abuse of family members.</p> <p>This severe and sweeping repression by the local authorities is designed to remind the Chechen public of Kadyrov\u2019s total control, and to contain the flow of any negative information from Chechnya that could undermine Russia\u2019s support.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhWkogGsQrc\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/NhWkogGsQrc?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Inaeva\u2019s appearance on Grozny TV in December. </figcaption> </figure>   <p>As a result, few people in Chechnya go as far as Inaeva.

The video was picked up by internet users in Chechnya and Russia and widely shared online.</p> <p>Fearing punishment from the authorities, <a href=\"http://www.rferl.org/a/chechnya-whistle-blower-apology-kadyrov-instagram-video/27770664.html\">Dzhalaldinov fled to Dagestan and made sure that his sons also left Chechnya</a>. But in May, four weeks after Grozny TV broadcast a news segment featuring local people calling Dzhalaldinov a liar and a crook, local police came looking for his wife and their daughters, aged 17, 12 and 10.</p> <p>A dozen armed men in masks and camouflage uniforms forced their way into the house late at night, dragged Dzhalaldinov\u2019s wife and the children out of bed, and took them to the district police station. </p> <p>Leaving the younger girls alone in a room, police officers beat their mother and eldest sister, saying it was punishment for the trouble caused by the head of the family. A senior official allegedly fired a gun several times over the mother\u2019s head and choked her daughter, demanding that they persuade Dzhalaldinov to publicly apologise.</p> <p>After the interrogation, police officers drove the women to Chechnya\u2019s administrative border with Dagestan, ordering them to cross and never return. That night, their home was torched.</p> <p>A few weeks later, Grozny TV broadcast a video apology by Dzhalaldinov: \u201cI apologise. I made a mistake. I ask other people not to repeat my mistake \u2026 Now many will say I was threatened or coerced [to say this]. I make this speech voluntarily \u2026 Kadyrov rebuilt this [Kenkhi] village.\u201d </p> <p>He had been told by officials that if he publicly renounced his statement, he would be able to return to Chechnya with his family.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Kadyrov's Instagram\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;instagram-media&quot; data-instgrm-version=&quot;7&quot; style=&quot; background:#FFF; border:0; border-radius:3px; box-shadow:0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width:658px; padding:0; width:99.375%; width:-webkit-calc(100% - 2px); width:calc(100% - 2px);&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;padding:8px;&quot;&gt; &lt;div style=&quot; background:#F8F8F8; line-height:0; margin-top:40px; padding:28.125% 0; text-align:center; width:100%;&quot;&gt; &lt;div style=&quot; background:url(data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAACwAAAAsCAMAAAApWqozAAAABGdBTUEAALGPC/xhBQAAAAFzUkdCAK7OHOkAAAAMUExURczMzPf399fX1+bm5mzY9AMAAADiSURBVDjLvZXbEsMgCES5/P8/t9FuRVCRmU73JWlzosgSIIZURCjo/ad+EQJJB4Hv8BFt+IDpQoCx1wjOSBFhh2XssxEIYn3ulI/6MNReE07UIWJEv8UEOWDS88LY97kqyTliJKKtuYBbruAyVh5wOHiXmpi5we58Ek028czwyuQdLKPG1Bkb4NnM+VeAnfHqn1k4+GPT6uGQcvu2h2OVuIf/gWUFyy8OWEpdyZSa3aVCqpVoVvzZZ2VTnn2wU8qzVjDDetO90GSy9mVLqtgYSy231MxrY6I2gGqjrTY0L8fxCxfCBbhWrsYYAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC); display:block; height:44px; margin:0 auto -44px; position:relative; top:-22px; width:44px;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style=&quot; color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/BGCk4xrCRjF/&quot; style=&quot; color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px; text-decoration:none;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;A video posted by Ramzan Kadyrov (@kadyrov_95)&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;time style=&quot; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;&quot; datetime=&quot;2016-05-30T17:45:25+00:00&quot;&gt;May 30, 2016 at 10:45am PDT&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;script async defer src=&quot;//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> <figcaption>A video posted on Kadyrov\u2019s Instagram account that appears to show Dzhalaldinov apologising. </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Kadyrov then told his two millions followers on Instagram that \u201csome abnormal forces\u201d had tried to use this man \u201cto achieve their filthy, harmful objectives\u201d but luckily, he \u201cfound the strength and wisdom\u201d to realise his mistake and publicly admit it, so his apology was accepted.</p> <p>Even those who use monikers or talk in closed groups on social media face reprisals. Late last year, a 35-year-old faculty member from a university in Grozny, Khizir Ezhiev, was chatting with friends in a private group on Facebook. When someone mentioned Kadyrov\u2019s pilgrimage to Mecca, Ezhiev wrote: \u201cApparently, all sorts are welcome there these days.\u201d</p> <p>Weeks later, four men bundled Ezhiev into their vehicle and drove away. His body was found weeks later with multiple injuries. Authorities claimed he had fallen off a cliff.</p> <p>The day after Ezhiev was abducted, an unrelated video surfaced of a young man walking on a treadmill in his underwear and apologising to Kadyrov.</p> <p>\u201cI am Adam Dikaev from Avtury village,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWwKZqct8V4\">he said on camera</a>. \u201cThinking that no one can find me, I wrote on Instagram [under another name] what I should not have written. They found me and took my pants down. I realised I am nobody. From now on, Putin is my father, grandfather, and tsar \u2026\u201d<br></p> <p>His crime?

Clinical psychologist Dr Courtney Bancroft suggests creating a \u201cbuffer zone\u201d for bedtime. \u201cGet your head and body in a space where the brain is signalling it\u2019s OK to go to sleep and rest,\u201d she says.<br></p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Worrying about falling to sleep can make it even harder to nod off</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Dr Annemarie Luik, a researcher at the University of Oxford, specialising in solutions for insomnia, agrees that it helps to wind down at least an hour before bed, doing relaxing activities like reading, knitting or listening to music.

Bancroft tells her patients to write a worry log and schedule a time to deal with them. \u201cWe are much better equipped to problem solve during the day when our minds are at peak performance than in the middle of the night when our brains are sleepy. Reminding yourself of this can be extremely helpful and can put your mind at ease,\u201d she says.<br></p> <p>Luik recommends keeping a pen and notebook next to the bed to write down any worries. \u201cSay to yourself you can deal with it tomorrow. One bonus of writing it down is that you can\u2019t forget it anymore either, it is on your list,\u201d she says.<br></p> <h2><strong>Try mindfulness techniques</strong></h2> <p>Simple mindfulness exercises, like focusing on breathing can help with insomnia, says Kat Dunn, a writer and editor at <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.mind.org.uk/\">Mind</a>. \u201cKeep your focus on the present moment and relax ready to sleep again in the night,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Meadows agrees: \u201cNoticing things objectively and without judgment in the present moment \u2013 like the touch of your duvet on your toes or the gentle movement of air in and out your nose \u2013 can actually promote sleep,\u201d he says.<br></p> <p>Rest is the best bridge to sleep, so meditation, which helps the body rest, is worth trying, says Charlie Morley, Hay House author and teacher of mindfulness meditation.

When this happens, \u201cget out of bed and cool down your mind\u201d, he suggests.<br></p> <p>Luik recommends the 15-min rule. This involves getting out of bed if you have been awake for about 15 minutes and doing something relaxing in dimmed light in a different room. \u201cJust guess the 15 minutes, don\u2019t start looking at the clock,\u201d she adds.<br></p> <p>However, Meadows says staying in bed is fine if you practise a bit of mindfulness. \u201cGiving yourself permission to be awake allows natural sleep to emerge.\u201d<br></p> <h2><strong>Seek professional help</strong></h2> <p>\u201cIf you are experiencing severe sleep problems for a long time do seek treatment,\u201d says Luik.

  "<h2>Ride a Snooc, Le Grand Bornand, France</h2> <p>Hiking off into the wilderness and finding peace away from the pistes is one of the most rewarding things to do in the mountains. But learning how to ski in backcountry takes years, and can involve a lot of swearing and slapstick mishap. Now, thanks to a new invention called the Snooc, even those who can\u2019t ski or snowboard can go snow-touring off the beaten track. It functions as a pair of easy-to-use skis for walking uphill, then when it\u2019s time to head down, it quickly transforms into a toboggan for riding safely and enjoyably back to the resort, perhaps even with a few powder turns along the way. Le Grand Bornand is one of the first resorts to offer Snooc rental. <br>\u2022<a href=\"http://snooc.ski/try-the-snooc/\"> <em>snooc.ski</em></a><em>, two-hour lesson \u00a326<br></em><strong>Book it: </strong> <a href=\"http://www.peakretreats.co.uk/winter/ski-resorts/aravis-lake-annecy/le-grand-bornand/le-village-de-lessy\"><strong>Peak Retreats</strong></a><strong> has a week in a four-star self-catering apartment, based on five sharing, including Eurotunnel crossing, for \u00a3214pp</strong></p> <h2>Baseboarding, Whistler, Canada </h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"19eb4b8bed3a0f6ded67d5adce53b0e6907e4cf9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/19eb4b8bed3a0f6ded67d5adce53b0e6907e4cf9/0_662_3312_1987/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Baseboarding, Whistler Olympic Park, Canada\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Given that snowboarding, which is essentially surfing on snow, was invented over 40 years ago, it\u2019s surprising that it\u2019s taken so long for someone to introduce front-lying bodyboarding to the slopes.

Fat bikes are less easy to control than normal bikes, so aren\u2019t allowed on open ski slopes,but cross-country skiers weren\u2019t mad about bikes being ridden on their trails either. Lenzerheide in eastern Switzerland may have the answer. It has closed one ski slope to skiers and snowboarders and turned it into a fat bike piste.

The following October, the county authorities forcibly rounded up more than 100 street children, forced them into a lorry and dumped them 80 miles away in Malaba, a town on the Ugandan border. Most walked back to Eldoret.</p> <p>The killings began after that, activists say. Ex-Street has documented the deaths of 14 minors so far this year, including three boys shot dead as they ran from police and three more whose bodies were found days after they had been arrested. At least five more are missing after being taken into custody and another two \u2013 9-year-old Kevin Simuyu and David Kamau, eight, have not been seen since they were shot and wounded by police a fortnight after the raid on California Barracks.<br></p> <p>Some believe that the attacks on street children are ethnically motivated. Most are not members of the county\u2019s dominant Kalenjin community, the ethnic group of Kenya\u2019s powerful deputy president, William Ruto.</p> <p>The region around Eldoret has witnessed some of Kenya\u2019s worst ethnic violence, often because of politically-manipulated tensions over land ownership. In 1991, Kalenjin warriors impaled foetuses ripped from dying Kikuyu women on spears which were then placed on the side of the road leading into Eldoret, as anger over Kikuyu encroachment into the ancestral lands exploded.</p> <p>The violence reached a peak after a controversial election in 2007 saw Mwai Kibaki, a Kikuyu, re-elected president. At least 1,200 people were killed in the ensuing violence across Kenya, but the clashes were at their deadliest in and around Eldoret, where scores of Kikuyu women and children sheltering in a church were burned to death by Kalenjin fighters.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"08ea4ae841c1e0ad546f04b84d3bb633a6e5e60f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/08ea4ae841c1e0ad546f04b84d3bb633a6e5e60f/0_202_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A street in Eldoret, Kenya.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A street in Eldoret, Kenya.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Although the Kalenjin and Kikuyu are now reconciled and share power (President Uhuru Kenyatta is a Kikuyu), some local politicians and clergymen say the attacks on street children appear to be part of a campaign of intimidation designed to force non-Kalenjins to leave Eldoret.</p> <p>\u201cIf we don\u2019t stop the killing of street families, this will escalate,\u201d said Peter Chomba, a ruling party county legislator, who is Kikuyu. \u201cIf you look at what is happening, it is a pre-planned campaign. They profile professions drawn from certain communities and then attack them. What is happening is an attempt to claim this place for one community.\u201d</p> <p>Whatever the motive, few Kenyans would be particularly shocked to hear that the police were killing minors in Eldoret. Human rights groups have raised repeated concerns that extrajudicial killings have become part of police culture in Kenya. Reports of the execution of suspected Islamists, petty criminals and even human rights activists are becoming increasingly common. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/28/kenya-seaside-look-peaceful-murderous-war-al-shabaab\">Kenya\u2019s seaside looks peaceful, but a murderous war is being waged</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Last week Kenya\u2019s Daily Nation newspaper published a database documenting 122 police killings in the country so far this year.

He escaped, twice, thanks to the intervention of passersby.

Despite being enthusiastic and experienced, these women often find it difficult to get work because of barriers such as a lack of confidence and knowledge around how to fill in application forms.</p> <p>Gill Chapman, lead nurse for nursing and midwifery workforce, who heads the project at the trust, says: \u201cWithin our community, there are a number of people who are finding it difficult to access employment. They want to work within the trust but through the normal processes they\u2019ve not been successful.\u201d Nationwide, there is a high vacancy rate in nursing; Leeds is no exception and this scheme also helps the trust meets its staffing requirements. Chapman adds: \u201cIt\u2019s a win-win.\u201d</p> <p> Chapman insists that entry requirements for roles have not been compromised.

  "<p>A group of concerned EU citizens living in Britain are to launch a formal campaign for a new law to protect their rights post-Brexit.</p> <p>The 3 Million forum has been founded by a group of French people who want to cut through the \u201cxenophobic rhetoric\u201d and assert what they feel is their right to remain. </p> <p>They plan to lobby MPs for support for a new law to grant every EU citizen already settled in Britain a blanket right to permanent residency.</p> <p>Nicolas Hatton, a marketing executive who is spearheading the campaign, said he and other concerned French citizens decided they needed to lobby just like any industry sector to convey an urgent need for action. </p> <p>\u201cIt will be sometime before we know what a Brexit deal will look like, but we need something urgently to take the anxiety out of the equation for the 3 million EU citizens in this country,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Hatton, who has lived in the UK for 21 years and is an elected representative of the French overseas community in Britain, helped to set up the 3 Million forum after a meeting of more than 200 EU citizens in Bristol. </p> <p>\u201cThere was a lot of concern being expressed, but it was not channelled in any way so we decided to set up this group. We want to focus on the question of what is going to happen in the future and seek to protect our rights,\u201d he said. </p> <p>\u201cOur aim is to get to the point where we can get the government to pass a law to protect our rights.\u201d</p> <p>Like many EU citizens who have settled in the UK, Hatton has watched recent political developments with a growing sense of alarm and feels xenophobia will take root unless it is challenged. </p> <p>Immigration lawyers are advising many EU citizens who wish to stay in Britain beyond Brexit to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/01/home-office-prepares-for-rise-in-residency-applications-from-eu-migrants\">apply for permanent residence</a> in order to acquire a degree of protection in the event Theresa May proves unable to negotiate a continuation of reciprocal rights as part of the withdrawal agreement.</p> <p>There is no legal requirement to do so because all EU citizens currently have reciprocal rights to live, work, retire, draw a pension and access public services across the entire bloc, but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/13/zero-chance-eu-citizens-keep-same-rights-post-brexit-expert\">leading barristers have said there is \u201czero chance\u201d this will remain the case after Brexit</a>. They point out that the only rights protected under international law are those to own property and run a business.</p> <p>Those who have decided to apply for permanent residence say the process is a bureaucratic nightmare. They have to complete an 80-page application form and back it up with dozens of documents including original payslips, bank statements, P60s, tax papers and proof of identity. Applicants must also list all travel during their stay in Britain.</p> <p>\u201cI have had to list all trips outside the UK for the past six years. If I have been out of the country for more than six months in any one of those trips, they reset the clock,\u201d said David Lusseau, a professor of behavioural biology at the University of Aberdeen, who supports the campaign. </p> <p>\u201cI feel like a second-class citizen having to do this and my instinct is to tell them where to go, but I have to do this to protect my family,\u201d said Bruno Pollet, a French national living in Britain for 25 years. </p> <p>Hatton says the 80-page application form is not fit for purpose and the initial focus of the campaign will be to persuade the Home Office to simplify a process that was not designed for EU citizens.</p> <p>\u201cWhat we want is something that will give a blanket right to all EU citizens. We don\u2019t think this will happen before <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/02/theresa-may-great-repeal-bill-eu-british-law\">the great repeal act</a>, but we don\u2019t want to wait until Brexit day. That will be too late, so now is the time to lobby,\u201d he said. </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/Forum4EUcitizens/\">A closed Facebook group </a>has already attracted more than 3,000 followers and it hopes to spawn an active campaign across the country. </p> <p>\u201cWe want to get members in every constituency lobbying their MP. What you will see is a lot of companies and interest groups campaigning for something, but the difference is we are Europeans who are directly affected. We are not part of the establishment and we need our voice heard,\u201d said Hatton. </p>",
  "<p>I changed my mind about helping foreign journalists report inside Chechnya when I witnessed a reporter\u2019s abduction in the centre of the capital, Grozny.</p> <p>It was the beginning of 2016 and a group of journalists with cameras, obviously not local, were going into a cafe just as I was leaving it. Suddenly, several men in civilian clothing began to attack them. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/10/public-humiliation-chechen-leader-ramzan-kadyrov-strategy-control-social-media\">Public humiliation: Chechen leader's simple strategy to control social media</a> </p> </aside>  <p>One woman was shouting that she was a journalist from Moscow. She was screaming her name but not a single person, including me, dared to approach the men, their guns visible underneath their black clothes.</p> <p>The journalists were arrested, thrown into an unmarked car and driven away. </p> <p>I realised then that even helping outsiders tell the story of what is going on inside Chechnya has serious consequences. Foreign reporters will do their job and leave. But if they write a story that is critical of the young president, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/23/putins-closest-ally-and-his-biggest-liability\">Ramzan Kadyrov</a>, or his government, the first thing the police will do is track down the locals who helped them<strong>.</strong><br></p> <p>As a result, the purpose of journalism has completely changed. I became a journalist three years ago, at a time when students at the Chechen State University were being taught that they must become \u201csoldiers on the ideological front\u201d. </p> <p>We entered a world where the handful of media outlets allowed to operate produce nearly identical content, churning out \u201cnews\u201d on the opening of a school or a milk factory, or the president holding a football match, or yet another VIP delegation from Moscow or some Arab country visiting the capital.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"294499d9cb8f842e58cd7cf73ca2d20d6524a2bb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/294499d9cb8f842e58cd7cf73ca2d20d6524a2bb/0_187_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Akmad Kadyrov mosque in Grozny.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Akmad Kadyrov mosque in Grozny, named after the current leader\u2019s father.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tass/Barcroft Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>News editors now do not even look at material faintly critical of any government organisation. Simply suggesting a story on everyday problems encountered by people in Chechnya could attract suspicion from \u201ctrue patriots\u201d. The police could start monitoring your telephone calls and your Facebook, or you could be added to a blacklist. People who express an opinion different to that of the authorities are routinely subjected to public humiliation.</p> <p>On <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BApvJo8tBVe/\">Instagram</a>, in articles for state newspapers<a href=\"http://izvestia.ru/news/601935\"> including </a><a href=\"http://www.grozny-inform.ru/main.mhtml?Part=8&amp;PubID=67814\">Groznyi-Inform</a>, and in an interview with the state broadcaster,<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4JR3Vlr06c\"> Grozny TV</a>, Kadyrov and his staff have made intimidating statements about critical journalists, declaring them \u201ctraitors\u201d and \u201cenemies of the people\u201d helping the west \u201cwreak chaos in Russia\u201d.</p> <p>As a result, local media works according to one principle: \u201cDo not to make Kadyrov angry.\u201d </p> <p>In this climate of fear and suspicion, the detention and beating of journalists no longer surprises locals. At the beginning of this year, a bus carrying a group of reporters and activists was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/10/journalists-beaten-and-bus-torched-on-chechnya-tour-say-activists\">attacked and burnt.</a> Those responsible are yet to be found. </p> <p>Two months later, a journalist for Kavkazsky Uzel (Caucasian Knot) was ambushed on his way from his village to Chechnya. Zhalaudi Geriev, 23, was <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2016/09/06/russia-journalist-punished-chechnya-reporting\">dragged out of a shuttle bus and taken to a forest</a>. The assailants pulled a plastic bag over his head and tortured him. They forced him to sign a confession that he had been carrying drugs, and he was sentenced to more than three years in prison.</p> <p>Geriev\u2019s case is little mentioned in Grozny. The sentence was a warning to all doubters and dissenters, and it\u2019s effective: today, I do not know a single journalist here who would agree to work on a story that was anything other than positive about life in post-war Chechnya.</p> <p>Reporters are given an extra incentive to comply: during the annual TV industry party, Kadyrov gives out money, apartments, cars and other presents to dozens of journalists. For people whose salaries total between 10,000 and 25,000 roubles (\u00a3125 to \u00a3315), this is a significant gesture, and writers try to get noticed and impress the leadership by writing the best possible story about government policies.</p> <p>It\u2019s a simple system. Journalists, who have no hope of escaping the republic and fear being branded \u201cAmerica\u2019s henchman\u201d, know their job: to write exactly what Kadyrov wants.<br></p>",

She wrote hundreds of stories for the <em>New Yorker</em>, as well as 15 books of essays and memoir. She produced the best English translation of Brillat-Savarin\u2019s 1825 classic <em>The Physiology of Taste</em>, as well as a novel, a screenplay, a book for children and many travelogues. Other food writers would confine their writing to the recipes or the mundane details of a particular cuisine, but MFK Fisher used food as a metaphor. Inevitably, as she complained in a 1990 interview, her subject matter \u201ccaused serious writers and critics to dismiss me for many, many years. It was woman\u2019s stuff, a trifle.\u201d But she remained true to her self, described, in her 1943 volume, as <em>The Gastronomical Me</em>. Her critics eventually caught up. \u201cIn a properly run culture,\u201d wrote the <em>New York Times Book Review</em>, \u201cMary Frances Kennedy Fisher would be recognised as one of the great writers this country has produced in this century.\u201d</p> <p>Her first book,<em> Serve It Forth</em> (1937), made this declaration: \u201cif you have to eat to live, you may as well enjoy it.\u201d This theme was repeated in <em>Consider the Oyster </em>(1941): \u201cAn oyster leads a dreadful but exciting life. Indeed, his chance to live at all is slim, and if he should survive the arrows of his own outrageous fortune and in the two weeks of his carefree youth find a clean smooth place to fix on, the years afterwards are full of stress, passion and danger\u2026\u201d</p> <p>Fisher\u2019s embrace of the slow, sensual pleasures of the table was matched by her cool acceptance of sudden jeopardy and violence. One critic of <em>How to Cook a Wolf </em>noted \u201cthe faintly Gothic perversity that makes Mrs Fisher\u2019s literature unique\u201d. For Fisher, <em>How to Cook a Wolf</em> was \u201cabout living as decently as possible with the ration cards and blackouts of World War II\u201d. It was also a poignant farewell to the author\u2019s youthful exuberance:</p> <p>\u201cThere are very few men and women, I suspect, who cooked and marketed their way though the past war without losing for ever some of the nonchalant extravagance of the 1920s. They will feel, until their final days on earth, a kind of culinary caution: butter, no matter how unlimited, is a precious substance; meats, too, and eggs, and all the far brought spices of the world, take on a new significance, having once been so rare.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s in such passages that you can detect the strong affinities between Fisher and her British counterpart, Elizabeth David (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/aug/22/100-best-nonfiction-books-no-30-book-of-mediterranean-food-elizabeth-david\" title=\"\">No 30 in this series</a>). Even when the wolf was at the door, she was always a fierce advocate of a libertarian approach to cooking and eating. \u201cNow, of all times in our history,\u201d she declares, \u201cwe should be using our minds to live gracefully if we live at all.\u201d Fisher hated the tyranny of the American diet:</p> <p>\u201cIn our furious efforts to prove that all men are created equal we encourage our radios, our movies, above all our weekly and monthly magazines, to set up a fantastic ideal in the minds of family cooks, so that everywhere earnest eager women are whipping themselves and their budgets to the bone to provide three \u2018balanced\u2019 meals a day for their men and children.\u201d</p> <p>As well as polemical, <em>How to Cook a Wolf</em> is also subversive. The chapter \u201cHow to Catch the Wolf\u201d is a witty assault on the tyranny of \u201cthrift\u201d. And \u201cHow to Distribute Your Virtue\u201d is, frankly, plain saucy. To avoid accusations of self-indulgence, Fisher also has chapters such as \u201cHow to Boil Water\u201d, \u201cHow Not to Boil an Egg\u201d and \u201cHow to be Cheerful Through Starving\u201d. Her trademark sensuality is never far away: \u201cHow to Be Content With a Vegetable Love\u201d; \u201cHow to Have a Sleek Pelt\u201d and \u201cHow to Drink to the Wolf\u201d.</p> <p>The reviews of <em>How to Cook a Wolf </em>described it as \u201cirresistibly seductive\u201d, \u201ca book you can hardly wait to get your teeth into\u201d and \u201ca licence to dream\u201d. It\u2019s hard not to imagine that her critics were really describing MFK Fisher herself who, on the final page of How to Cook a Wolf, celebrated \u201cthe pleasures of the flesh\u201d.</p> <p>Fisher\u2019s credo was to live a full life. She had no time for prudence, especially at the table. In <em>An Alphabet for Gourmets</em> (1949) she wrote: \u201cA complete lack of caution is perhaps one of the true signs of a real gourmet: he has no need for it, being filled as he is with a God-given and intelligently self-cultivated sense of gastronomical freedom. He not only knows from everything admirable he has read that he will not like Irish whiskey with pineapple chilled in honey and vermouth, or a vintage Chambertin with poached lake perch; but every taste bud on both his actual and his spiritual palate wilts in revulsion at such thoughts.

But he denied he had assaulted women, whereas, he said, Bill Clinton had been \u201cso abusive to women\u201d.</li> <li><strong>Clinton did not respond to Trump\u2019s catalog </strong>of her husband\u2019s alleged assaults, apart to say it was inaccurate. \u201cWhen they go low, you go high,\u201d she said.</li> <li><strong>Clinton placed Trump\u2019s hot mic remarks in context</strong> with others \u2013 she listed his attack on the family of Humayan Khan, a US soldier killed in the Iraq war, his \u201cbirther\u201d attack on Barack Obama, his attack on a disabled reporter and his attack on an American federal judge of Mexican descent \u2013 to paint Trump as an unreformed bully. She said Trump \u201cowes the country an apology\u201d.</li> <li><strong>Trump projected intense hostility for Clinton</strong>. He repeatedly called her a liar, leered at her, scoffed, said she had accomplished nothing in her career. Physically, he loomed behind her as she spoke with audience members. He also told her if he were president, \u201cyou\u2019d be in jail\u201d. He pointed at her, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2016/oct/09/debate-live-fact-check-trump-tape-presidential-election-republican-critics?page=with:block-57fafaa2e4b0e4aaeaa8db62#block-57fafaa2e4b0e4aaeaa8db62\">said</a>, \u201cshe has tremendous hate in her heart\u201d.</li> <li><strong>\u201cI know you\u2019re into big diversion tonight,\u201d</strong> Clinton told Trump. \u201cAnything to avoid talking about your campaign and its explosion and how Republicans are leaving it.\u201d At least 36 elected Republicans had either rescinded endorsements of Trump or explicitly stated rejections of him in the wake of the 2005 video. </li> <li><strong>More than one snap analyst \u2013 for what that\u2019s worth </strong>\u2013 thought Trump had \u201cshored up his base\u201d of supporters by attacking Clinton over deleted emails, the 2012 Benghazi attack that killed four Americans, and other issues. Few asserted that he had broadened his appeal.</li> <li><strong>Twice Clinton said that Russia was seeking to influence </strong>the election, and not on her behalf, citing US intelligence officials who accused the Kremlin of attacks on Friday.</li> <li><strong>Trump said he disagreed with running mate</strong> Mike Pence\u2019s assertion that the US should consider military force to oppose Russian aggression in Syria. Pence tweeted congratulations after the debate.<br></li> <li><strong>Trump also said there\u2019s no Muslim ban plan any more, despite his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/dec/07/donald-trump-ban-all-muslims-entering-us-san-bernardino-shooting\">call for one</a> in December 2015</strong>. \u201cThe Muslim ban is something that in some form has morphed into extreme vetting.\u201d</li> <li><strong>A few times, Trump seemed to shock Clinton. </strong>He said that Capt Humayun Khan would still be alive if he, Trump, were president at the time \u2013 when George W Bush, a Republican, was commander-in-chief.</li> <li><strong>Trump admitted unapologetically</strong> that he had applied almost $1bn in personal losses to not pay federal income tax. \u201cOf course I do.\u201d</li> <li><strong>Trump staged a media event before the debate </strong>with three women who have accused Bill Clinton of sexual assault or rape and one woman, raped as a child, whose assailant Hillary Clinton defended, as ordered by a judge, as a 27-year-old lawyer.</li> <li><strong>Clinton was asked about a line from a WikiLeaks version</strong> of a purported paid speech in which she describe a president\u2019s need to have separate public and private faces. She said she was talking about Abraham Lincoln.</li> <li><strong>The candidates did not shake hands</strong> when they arrived at the town hall. Trump had the sniffles. And he complained a lot about the moderators letting Clinton talk more than him. A time clock count afterwards showed the time was split almost evenly.</li> </ul>",

  "<p>One otherwise normal childhood day, a bullet hole was discovered in our farmhouse\u2019s front window. It was a perfect-dime sized circle through the century-old glass. Since no one was there as a witness, we couldn\u2019t and won\u2019t ever prove a thing. </p> <p>It could have been a stray, said my mother, still clinging to wishful thinking if you ask me. It could have been there for months or even years; maybe it was from a stone or a marble from the kids next door. </p> <p>But the whole truth is our turn-of-the-century farmhouse, built by her grandfather, was doing double-duty as a law office. For as long as I can remember, our downstairs library, living and dining room had been converted into my parents\u2019 joint in-home law firm; Dad did criminal defence and Mom practiced family law, specifically divorces. </p> <p>Guess which one is more dangerous.</p> <p>The general consensus was that the bullet was retribution from a client\u2019s disgruntled ex-spouse. In a small town like ours, these people weren\u2019t rare. Once when I absent-mindedly dented a (very unforgiving) man\u2019s car in the local bank\u2019s parking lot, I smugly passed him my mother\u2019s card to follow up. \u201cThis is my ex-wife\u2019s lawyer,\u201d he said, his face long and white. He never called.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/oct/06/divorce-survival-guide-seven-truths-after-relationship-ends\">Seven things I wish I'd known before my divorce: an optimistic guide to the future</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As such, divorce was everywhere at our house. So was free legal advice: \u201cRosebud,\u201d said my mother only semi-seriously, \u201cevery time you walk down the aisle with a man, you need to ask yourself, <em>Is this the man I want my children spending every other weekend with?</em>\u201d Marital advice was equally plentiful. From my wise grandfather, an economics lesson I\u2019ve never forgotten: \u201cMarry for money and you\u2019ll earn every cent.\u201d </p> <p>But to us, it was all very normal. Hysterical clients routinely called the house at all hours of the night, but we were very happy. Since it would be immediately filled to the brim with domestic dramas, we never had an answering machine, which made staying out past curfew an easy breeze. When my friend\u2019s parents split, as most did over the years, my tween self would help the only way she knew how: \u201cCall my mom,\u201d I\u2019d suggest like a grownup. They always did.<br></p> <p>At the same time, and very confusingly, divorce was nowhere at all. Against whatever you might be thinking, my parents had been happily married for years. They still are. We joked that\u2019s because, should they ever split, Mom would take Dad to the cleaners. (They reassured us it would never happen, lest either be given custody of the kids.) Still, I had a recurring dream of my parents\u2019 divorce trial, my three brothers and I called as character witnesses on either side of the unfolding court case. I\u2019m not a child of divorce, per se, but tell my subconscious that.</p> <p>Nobody in the immediate family divorced \u2013 parents, grandparents, siblings, their kids, all are growing up and one by one tying the knot themselves. Yet every engagement is a shock to be wary of, each one met with uncertainty and cynicism and suspicion. All unions are would-be divorces, huge and messy mistakes-in-the-making. Especially mine.</p> <p>At 32, after six years with my lovely boyfriend, including five of co-habitation and two of home ownership, it was what my dad matter-of-factly called \u201ctime to legitimize\u201d. (He and my mother had taken nine years, which I believe is equivalent to 25 in the 1970s, but I digress.) They had discussed, I\u2019m sure, and deemed our union acceptable and advantageous to both parties. After everything and a bullet too, they wanted me to commit to the very institution that I\u2019d spent a whole lifetime watching fail.</p> <p>I was ripped into two, a part of me on either side of that long-held, semi-true statistic that one in two marriages will end in divorce. To say I had marriage-phobia is a laughable understatement. Reluctant to subscribe to any tradition, I had imagined and designed my own engagement ring, given it to him to give back to me. I did not want any surprises. Yet when he got down on one knee, things felt sudden. I felt distinctly unready. I said yes anyway. </p> <p>In the next few months, I had mounting anxieties, stomach aches and stress headaches, irrational doubts about the most mundane things. I zoomed in on every detail \u2013 an unnecessary shopping spree here, a mouldy cereal bowl there \u2013 wondering if this transgression in particular might ultimately prove divorce-worthy in the years to come. My capacity to dwell, of course, to be moody and unforgiving, would kill us just the same and much faster. That we\u2019ll fail and divorce, for some reason as yet unknown, was and is my greatest fear. </p> <p>There are a million pop culture examples of The One, of love at first sight, of \u201cjust knowing\u201d. This kind of blind faith is supposed to trump the rest and plop your marriage on to an elevated plane where you\u2019ll make it for sure. Only it\u2019s not true one bit. Nothing is for sure or forever, and every day is a negotiation. But since it\u2019s far less romantic, we don\u2019t hear those stories much. We aren\u2019t shown the daily grind of couples who have chosen each other, wisely if they\u2019re lucky, who constantly work at themselves and their marriages. For them, love isn\u2019t a vague feeling beyond words but indeed a binding contract to which you both subscribe. I will be here tomorrow, it says. </p> <p>Of that I have no doubt. And as for the rest, at least at my house, doubt is <em>good</em>. Doubt means you\u2019re looking carefully at the case at hand, that you\u2019re weighing the evidence on all sides. Doubt means you\u2019ve thought long and hard about this. Doubt means you can\u2019t be jinxed, because you\u2019re not that fickle to begin with.</p> <p>Still I know the odds. I could just as easily become like the hundreds, maybe thousands, of broken-hearted clients that sat sadly in the waiting room (where the bullet came through, though we didn\u2019t advertise that). Or I could be like Mom and Dad, still going to work together every day, and home together every night, holding hands as they discuss their cases.</p>",
  "<p>Conversations about the advancement of women at work are now so commonplace that it can seem like a foregone conclusion that, someday soon, women will have equal opportunities and pay. </p> <p>But then you start wading through the comments under news articles on gender diversity and you realise there is a very angry, resentful undertow from some (mostly men) who demonstrate a fear that when women win, men and families will lose.</p> <p>Women\u2019s empowerment advocate Julie McKay acknowledges the diversity movement hasn\u2019t always argued its case well \u2013 especially when it comes to that section of the community that fears it is being victimised and left behind. </p> <p>\u201cWe say things like \u2018diversity is good for business\u2019 and we, accidentally, move on and talk about other things \u2013 having mistakenly thought everyone in the room agrees with us,\u201d says McKay, the former executive director of UN Women Australia, who starts a new job as lead partner for diversity and inclusion at PwC when she finishes her parental leave in February 2017.</p> <p>McKay says the people who actively resist diversity probably don\u2019t have all the information. \u201cThey have either been shut out of the conversation or told their views are stupid or not valued.

Shelton was the victim in a 1975 rape case in which Hillary Clinton, in her capacity as a lawyer, was assigned by an Arkansas court to represent her alleged assailant. All four were subsequently Trump\u2019s guests in the debate hall.</p> <p>Both Jones and Willey have alleged inappropriate sexual conduct by Bill Clinton in the 1990s. Jones claimed in a civil law suit in 1994 that the then Arkansas governor propositioned her and exposed himself to her in a hotel room in 1991. Clinton denied the accusations. Jones\u2019s case was settled without admission of guilt, with Clinton paying her $850,000. </p> <p>Willey, a former White House aide, accused Clinton in 1998 on 60 Minutes that the president had sexually harassed her during a meeting in the Oval Office in 1993.

Through lawyers, Clinton denied the accusation.</p> <p>The women took turns in speaking, after Trump had praised their courage.

He even retweeted her tweets, a step rarely taken by the candidate who normally manually quotes tweets.</p> <p>Broaddrick alleges that Clinton raped her in a hotel room while violently biting her upper lip. Clinton has flatly denied the claims, which emerged publicly in 1999 during the investigation of the former president by the independent counsel Ken Starr. The year earlier, Broaddrick had filed a sworn affidavit saying that the allegations against Clinton were untrue. Starr ruled that Broaddrick\u2019s testimony about the incident was \u201cinconclusive\u201d and did not use it.

Taylor eventually took a plea bargain for a lesser charge. </p> <p>In her statement, Palmieri continued: \u201cHillary Clinton understands the opportunity in this town hall is to talk to voters on stage and in the audience about the issues that matter to them, and this stunt doesn\u2019t change that. </p> <p>\u201cIf Donald Trump doesn\u2019t see that, that\u2019s his loss.

  "<p>If the middle portion of the match was nothing special, the beginning and end of the National Women\u2019s Soccer League championship were replete with drama, as the Washington Spirit and Western New York Flash traded goals early on before the Flash claimed the title on penalties after scoring a last-gasp equalizer in extra time.</p> <p>The Spirit \u2013 leading 2-1 after Crystal Dunn scored her second of the game early in extra time \u2013 looked to be cruising to victory, their opponents a spent force. But one last, desperate punt into the penalty area led to a messy goal for Lynn Williams, the league MVP.</p> <p>The night only grew more shrouded in the surreal after that, as a as a succession of players you\u2019d have strongly expected to score missed from the penalty spot for both sides. In the end, Flash goalkeeper Sabrina D\u2019Angelo was the hero.</p> <p>The 23-year-old Canadian dropped her most valuable player of the game award as she walked into the press room, but her handling was more secure in the shoot-out, when she made three saves.</p> <p>\u201cWashington did play better than us but we kept fighting,\u201d she said. \u201cAs soon as [Williams] scored I had no doubt in my mind that we would get the job done.\u201d</p> <p>Paul Riley, the Flash\u2019s Liverpool-born head coach, was banned from the touchline after being ejected during a heated moment in the semi-final, but swiftly made his way from the stands to the pitch to celebrate with his players. He conceded that \u201cit wasn\u2019t one of our greatest performances\u201d but \u201cthis was a team of destiny for sure\u201d.</p> <p>That and reaping the benefits of repetition: Riley said that his team often practised being down a goal in the last five minutes in training, when he drills them in the fine art of \u201chumping the ball forward and hoping something happens\u201d.</p> <p>Something did, when it mattered most, even though the Spirit had impressively kept the Flash\u2019s formidable forwards quiet until the 124th minute, when Jessica McDonald crossed for Williams, who made the most of bad defending.</p> <p>\u201cTo give away a goal like that,\u201d said Spirit midfielder Christine Nairn, her voice cracking with emotion, \u201cit\u2019s hard to comprehend right now \u2026 This one\u2019s going to hurt for a while for sure.\u201d</p> <p>Jim Gabarra, in his first season as Spirit head coach, rightly said that \u201cfor most of the match we were the better side\u201d. And then, he added ruefully, \u201cour two best penalty kick takers, they get saved.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6ab207392b4fb63ba54364d7ce42d7151bd44319\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6ab207392b4fb63ba54364d7ce42d7151bd44319/0_63_1626_976/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sabrina D\u2019Angelo: \u2018I had no doubt in my mind that we would get the job done.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sabrina D\u2019Angelo: \u2018I had no doubt in my mind that we would get the job done.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Scott Halleran/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It was an improbable end to an unheralded match-up. You would have needed to be bold \u2013 or perhaps working for the statistics website <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/this-nwsl-season-has-been-nuts-heres-how-we-forecast-the-finish/\">FiveThirtyEight</a> \u2013 to have predicted a final between these teams in the early stages of the campaign.</p> <p>The Flash, seventh last year, profited from facing the hapless Boston Breakers four times in a 20-game season and only secured a playoff place on the final weekend of the of the regular season. </p> <p>But they beat the favored Portland Thorns in the semi-finals, 4-3 after extra time, with two goals from the 23-year-old Williams. It was only the Flash\u2019s second away win since 7 May.</p> <p>The Spirit, who finished second to Portland in the regular season, also needed extra time to reach the final at BBVA Compass Stadium in Houston, overcoming the Chicago Red Stars 2-1.</p> <p>The Flash\u2019s youth \u2013 seven members of Sunday\u2019s starting XI were under 25, with McCall Zerboni the senior player aged 29 \u2013 duly translated to a bustling and direct style that contrasted with the Spirit\u2019s more patient approach built on short passes.</p> <p>In the ninth minute, with observers still digesting the Spirit\u2019s surprise decision to start with three center backs, a Washington forward became the centre of attention. Dunn beat D\u2019Angelo to a bouncing long ball at the edge of the area and finished into the unguarded net from a tricky angle.</p> <p>The lead lasted less than five minutes. While Washington\u2019s defensive adjustment was seemingly made out of deference to the threat of Williams and McDonald, the league\u2019s most prolific duo, midfielder Sam Mewis is also a talent worthy of close attention. She collected the ball on the edge of the box, adroitly fashioned a shooting chance and beat goalkeeper Kelsey Wys with a low shot. Quite a way to celebrate her 24th birthday.</p> <p>Defender Caprice Dydasco was substituted with a left knee injury, forcing the Spirit\u2019s back line to adjust again, but Western New York did not take advantage. Williams had the most shots of any NWSL player during the regular season, with McDonald third, yet neither mustered an attempt in a first half that settled into a dour midfield battle in the southeast Texas sunshine, despite Dunn\u2019s dizzying runs.</p> <p>The 24-year-old made the US Olympic roster earlier this year. \u201cShe\u2019s special right now, doing very well,\u201d the US head coach, Jill Ellis, told reporters at half time before swatting away a question about suspended goalkeeper Hope Solo\u2019s future: \u201cI haven\u2019t even thought about it, to be honest,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Little was special about the second half, which saw the Flash look brighter in attack without creating many good chances as both sides struggled for coherence and Dunn\u2019s influence waned. McDonald did have a promising shooting opportunity but, strangely for a forward with 11 regular season goals, diffidently chose to pass and the ball was cleared.</p> <p>Extra time duly arrived before a crowd of 8,255. The match got the jolt it needed only 59 seconds into the restart as a lightning bolt of a shot from Dunn just inside the box beat D\u2019Angelo high to her left.</p> <p>Experience then told, as the Spirit comfortably preserved their lead and even looked like adding to it as the Flash faded, running out of ideas and energy. Yet there was one last twist during an inexplicably long-lived period of stoppage time.</p> <p>The Flash hoisted the ball into the box from the left wing and Wys came for the cross but was beaten to it by Williams \u2013 a likely candidate to score the unlikeliest of equalizers.</p> <p>Then came penalties, and D\u2019Angelo made three stops \u2013 from Ali Krieger, the US national team veteran; Tori Huster; and Canadian international Diana Matheson, a substitute \u2013 to render misses from Mewis and McDonald irrelevant. </p> <p>\u201cLuckily we got it done,\u201d said Riley. \u201cWe got it done\u201d.</p>"
