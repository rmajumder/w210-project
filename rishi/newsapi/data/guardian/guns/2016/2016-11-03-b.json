Claude Puel describes Inter as \u201ca great team with great players\u201d \u2013 though their 12th place in Serie A isn\u2019t overwhelmingly impressive \u2013 but says that given the Italian side sacked their manager, Frank de Boer, on Tuesday, \u201cit\u2019s difficult for us to prepare for this game because we don\u2019t know what to expect in terms of the profile, the spirit, the system of play\u201d. Funny that, as before the game against Burnley last month Puel said \u201csometimes it can be difficult to prepare\u201d, while ahead of the EFL Cup tie against Sunderland 10 days later he said \u201cit\u2019s a difficult game to prepare, because you don\u2019t know the Sunderland team\u201d. I think we can conclude that Puel quite frequently finds it difficult to prepare for stuff. Anyway, the team sheets already appear to be in, and the names upon them are thus:</p> <p><strong>Southampton:</strong> Forster, Yoshida, Rodriguez, Tadic, Romeu, Martina, Ward-Prowse, Van Dijk, Redmond, Hojbjerg, McQueen. <strong>Subs:</strong> Lewis, Clasie, Fonte, Davis, Austin, Boufal, Bertrand.<br><strong>Internazionale:</strong> Handanovic, Icardi, Ranocchia, Medel, Banega, Miranda, Gnoukouri, D\u2019Ambrosio, Perisic, Nagatomo, Candreva. <strong>Subs: </strong>Carrizo, Melo, Biabiany, Ansaldi, Santon, Eder, Murillo.<br><strong>Referee: </strong>Pawel Gil (Poland).</p> <p>Pawel Gil is a 40-year-old accountant. He has only taken charge of one previous game involving an English club side: Manchester City\u2019s 1-0 home win against Steaua Bucharest in August, when he didn\u2019t get his book out at any stage.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-581b4a33e4b07ceadb3a2109\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-03T14:36:12.250Z\">2.36pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Simon will be here shortly.</strong> In the meantime you can read about why James Ward-Prowse thinks this is such a huge game for the people of Southampton ...</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/nov/02/southampton-james-ward-prowse-internazionale\">Southampton\u2019s Ward-Prowse relishes \u2018great occasion\u2019 with Internazionale</a> </p> </aside> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-11-03T14:39:51.223Z\">at 2.39pm GMT</time></p>  </div>",

Even as we assist Saudi Arabia regarding the defence of their territorial integrity, we have and will continue to express our serious concerns about the conflict in Yemen and how it has been waged,\u201d a senior administration official said in an emailed statement. </p> <p>\u201cWe are aware of congressional concerns regarding the conflict in Yemen and we too remain gravely concerned by its high toll, including civilian casualties and damage to infrastructure caused by all sides of the conflict,\u201d a state department official said.</p> <p> \u201cWe continue to have internal policy discussions to ensure our limited support for the Saudi-led coalition is consistent with our foreign policy goals and values.\u201d</p> <p>According to <a href=\"http://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/rngs/USA-SAUDI-YEMEN/0100220E50F/USA-SAUDI-YEMEN%20DOC2.pdf\">documents</a> obtained by the Reuters news agency, the US provided the Saudis with a \u201cno-strike\u201d list of critical civilian infrastructure, and urged the coalition to avoid it in its air campaign. But it has continued to provide refueling and other logical support and argued that Saudi Arabia has a right to defend itself against missile attacks from Houthi rebels inside Yemen.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-saudi-yemen-idUSKCN12A0BQ\">Reuters revealed</a> that since the Saudi intervention in Yemen there has been concern among state department lawyers about the legal implications for the US. </p> <p>\u201cIt is important to the administration to keep the Saudis onside to ensure they did not screw up even more badly in Yemen as there was concern that if it went really badly it could rebound back on the Saudis,\u201d Jeremy Shapiro, a former state department official and research director at the European Council for Foreign Relations, said. The broader relationship with the Saudis is very important, and compared to the other things the Saudis ask for this is one of the easier ones.\u201d</p> <p>Shapiro said the argument over Washington\u2019s legal liability is largely an academic one as there is unlikely to be a court with jurisdiction over US actions in the conflict. The recognised Yemeni government supports the Saudi intervention on its behalf, and the US is not a member of the International Criminal Court. </p>",

Only one is still active. </p> <p>In 2013, the Australian Renewal Energy Agency (Arena) established an international geothermal expert group to review Australia\u2019s prospects for commercial geothermal energy generation. That group came to the conclusion that, despite more than $1bn worth of investment from the private sector and governments since the 1990s, the Australian geothermal energy sector faced significant technical hurdles, and the prospect of commercial viability before 2030 was slim.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/apr/13/heat-potential-latin-american-geothermal-power\">The heat beneath our feet: the potential of Latin American geothermal power</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Geothermal energy is harnessed in three main ways. The first is the simple hot spring beloved of tourists and health-seekers. There is even a specific term \u2013 balneotherapy \u2013 to describe the use of these for therapeutic benefits. These geothermally heated waters are also used to drive direct-use geothermal systems in places such as Perth, where 55C water is extracted from 500 to 1,200 metres underground and <a href=\"http://www.rockwater.com.au/services/geothermal/\" rel=\"nofollow\">used to heat water for swimming pools</a> or for space heating.</p> <p>The second option is a geothermal heat pump, like the one used to control the temperature at the <a href=\"http://www.ga.gov.au/about/facilities/building\" rel=\"nofollow\">Geosciences Australia building</a> in Canberra. This doesn\u2019t so much use geothermal energy as take advantage of the Earth\u2019s thermal mass to absorb heat during summer and release it during winter.</p> <p>The third option \u2013 and the one causing headaches for Australia\u2019s nascent geothermal energy industry \u2013 is geothermal electricity generation. The problem is not a lack of heat but rather how to economically tap into it.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re looking at heat that\u2019s effectively created by depth, and because we\u2019re doing this in sedimentary basin settings, three to four kilometres is usually the depth you need to get the temperatures required,\u201d says Dr Rowan Hansberry, a post-doctoral researcher at the <a href=\"https://www.adelaide.edu.au/geothermal/\" rel=\"nofollow\">South Australian centre for geothermal energy research</a>. </p> <p>In volcanically active Iceland, scalding hot water and steam rises through wells with minimum pumping. In Australia, accessing that subterranean heat means drilling at least two wells \u2013 one to pump down cold water at high pressure and another to extract the now-heated water \u2013 and hoping that the rock or substrate between the two wells is permeable enough or fractured enough to allow the water to pass through and collect heat on the way. </p> <p>This is the risky part of so-called enhanced geothermal energy. Geothermal companies don\u2019t know how permeable an area will be until they\u2019ve drilled the wells, which can cost $20m each. For Geodynamics Limited, <a href=\"http://arena.gov.au/project/cooper-basin-enhanced-geothermal-systems-heat-and-power-development/\" rel=\"nofollow\">it cost $144m</a> to find out that the wells drilled 4-5 kilometres into the Cooper Basin were not economically viable, at least in comparison to the alternatives, says Geodynamics\u2019 commercial manager, Gregory Wong.</p> <p>\u201cSolar photovoltaic is now so cheap that it\u2019s difficult for renewables which aren\u2019t currently commercially mature to chase solar photovoltaic down the cost curve,\u201d Wong says. \u201cEven if we continued to make improvements in our delivered cost of energy, the speed at which we can make improvements is nothing like the speed that solar PV has been reducing in cost, so we were getting further away from the cost of solar PV rather than closing the gap.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/may/29/sustainable-energy-iceland-geothermal-plant\">Sustainable energy: inside Iceland\u2019s geothermal power plant</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Enhanced geothermal energy is not impossible. The US energy department is actively pursuing enhanced geothermal energy with its <a href=\"http://energy.gov/eere/forge/forge-home\" rel=\"nofollow\">Frontier Observatory for Research in Geothermal Energy</a>, or FORGE R&amp;D, initiative, focusing on the factors that influence success in enhanced geothermal energy generation.</p> <p>Arena is now taking a similar approach, granting $450,000 to the University of Adelaide\u2019s South Australian centre for geothermal energy research to develop a map of geothermal structural permeability.</p> <p>One outcome of the international geothermal expert group\u2019s report was to highlight the fact that previous geothermal efforts had really just focused on finding subsurface heat but hadn\u2019t factored in the issue of permeability at those depths.</p> <p>\u201cThey had run into trouble with low flow rates out of wells and quickly decaying flow rates,\u201d Hansberry says. \u201cIf we can effectively map structural permeability well ahead of drilling, using existing data sets, we can effectively de-risk the drilling process and bring the cost down.\u201d</p> <p>To do this, the group is collecting existing data from previous drilling efforts \u2013 both for geothermal energy but also petroleum and mineral exploration and other subterranean endeavours \u2013 as well as data from seismic and geological studies to create a database of natural structural permeability data in four key basins.</p> <p>\u201cWhat we\u2019re looking at is, if we drill wells, are we going to get fluid consistently travelling through them at the right kind of residence times to heat up enough,\u201d Hansberry says.</p> <p>They\u2019re also road-testing the accuracy of the data by comparing their estimations of permeability with actual findings from some of the wells.</p> <p>Despite the hiccups faced so far, Hansberry is cautiously optimistic about the future of geothermal energy in Australia, pointing out that the heat is there but the biggest roadblock is our understanding of the geology.</p> <p>\u201cWe really need to de-risk that drilling, because it\u2019s far too expensive to go and drill a $150m well and then find out that we didn\u2019t understand the reservoir or we didn\u2019t understand the characteristics of what we were looking for.\u201d</p> <p><em>This article was amended on 8 November 2016 to reflect the fact that Arena was established in 2012 and inherited the 2010 project.</em></p>",

  "<p>Thousands had gathered in an outdoor field on the campus of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, braving the sweltering sun for hours ahead of what was likely Barack Obama\u2019s final visit to the area as president.</p> <p>With less than a week remaining until election day, Obama\u2019s speech campaigning for Hillary Clinton was marked by a palpable sense of urgency amid a tightening race. But as the US president delivered what has become his routine stump speech for Clinton on Wednesday \u2013 branding Donald Trump a threat to democracy and attacking the judgment of Republican lawmakers who support their nominee \u2013 he invoked a lesser known name before the fervent crowd.</p> <p>\u201cI want you think about a woman named named Grace Bell Hardison,\u201d Obama said.</p> <p>Hardison was a 100-year-old black woman who had lived in the same town in North Carolina her entire life. Last month, her voter registration was challenged in her home of Beaufort County in what officials called an effort to \u201cclear up\u201d the voting rolls. Of the list of <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://wnct.com/2016/10/18/106-beaufort-co-residents-have-voter-registration-challenged-weeks-before-election/\">138 purged voters</a> that included Hardison, 92 were black and registered Democrats. </p> <p>\u201cThat didn\u2019t happen by accident,\u201d Obama said. \u201cThere was a time when systematically denying black folks the right to vote was considered normal as well.\u201d</p> <p>Trump, he noted, was calling on supporters to monitor \u201ccertain areas\u201d at the polls. </p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re just out in public saying we\u2019re going to try and suppress the African American vote on election day, or the youth vote on election day.\u201d</p> <p>This was a seeming reference to <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-10-27/inside-the-trump-bunker-with-12-days-to-go\">a Bloomberg story</a> from last week in which an unnamed Trump official was quoted as saying: \u201cWe have three major voter suppression operations under way,\u201d aimed at idealistic white liberals, young women and African Americans.</p> <p>The critical battleground of North Carolina is in many ways the ground zero of concerns over access to the ballot among black voters. </p> <p>Republicans in the state have purged thousands of voters from the rolls, the majority of whom are black Democrats. The NAACP filed a lawsuit this week, stating that the practice of purging voter rolls up to 95 days before an election was a violation of federal law. The US justice department also issued a sharp warning to the election boards in the relevant counties of Beaufort, Moore and Cumberland.</p> <p>Penda Hair, an attorney representing the the North Carolina NAACP, said the counties in question were allowing \u201cindividual private vigilante residents\u201d to challenge voters based on mailings that were unregulated by the state. The private citizens were sending mailings that would come back as undeliverable, which they would then use to challenge the residence of the voters they wanted the county to purge from the rolls. </p> <p>To those in North Carolina, the pattern of purging voter rolls is reminiscent of efforts to curtail the black vote through strict voter ID laws struck down by a federal court earlier this year for targeting African Americans \u201cwith almost surgical precision\u201d. The supreme court denied a request in August to reinstate the law.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/08/state-factboxes/?id=NC\" data-alt=\"North Carolina\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/08/state-factboxes/?id=NC\">North Carolina</a> </figure>  <p>For Democrats, the issue threatens to dampen turnout among one of its core constituencies.

One of every three ballots cast in the county were by black voters, Clinton\u2019s campaign noted.</p> <p>Both Trump and Clinton returned to North Carolina on Thursday, while Obama took his pitch to Jacksonville, Florida, where early-voting returns pointing to an apparent loss of enthusiasm among black voters are fueling similar Democratic fears within that Trump could yet snatch victory in another crucial swing state.</p> <p>Exit polls from 2008 and 2012 showed 95% of Florida\u2019s black voters backing Obama. But they have not offered the same level of support for Clinton in the numbers expected, according to an analysis of early in-person voting data, angering a prominent African American Democratic congressman who said he had been \u201cscreaming for months\u201d for the Clinton campaign to spend more money on the black community in the state.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/08/state-factboxes/?id=FL\" data-alt=\"Florida\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/08/state-factboxes/?id=FL\">Florida</a> </figure>  <p>\u201cThey\u2019re not doing enough in the black community. I have been screaming for months about this and nothing changed and now look what\u2019s happening,\u201d said congressman Alcee Hastings, whose south Florida district incorporates almost all of the majority black precincts of Fort Lauderdale and West Palm Beach, told Politico.</p> <p>Clinton\u2019s staff has escalated its presence in the Sunshine State in the campaign\u2019s final days, with several appearances by the Democratic nominee as well as prominent surrogates in areas with significant black populations. They include Obama\u2019s appearance on Thursday in Duval County, where one in three registered voters is African American, and two addresses in three days by Clinton to overwhelmingly black crowds at a Baptist church and a civil rights memorial park in Fort Lauderdale, focused on themes such as reform of the criminal justice system and gun control.</p> <p>\u201cThe black vote is very important for Clinton\u2019s chances; the higher the turnout the better her chances are,\u201d said Matthew Pietryka, associate professor of political science at Florida State University.</p> <p>\u201cThey need to be rallying the troops and African Americans are historically and consistently strong supporters of Democrats,\u201d he said. \u201cMobilization through churches is particularly effective, so being short on time and with early voting underway, it\u2019s an effective way to get out the vote.\u201d</p> <p>The worry for Clinton, who has seen her four-point lead over Trump <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/fl/florida_trump_vs_clinton-5635.html\">in Real Clear Politics\u2019 Florida average of polls</a> turn into a dead heat in only 10 days, is reflected in a comparison of this year\u2019s early-voting returns so far with those from 2012.</p> <p>While the official state figures, analysed by elections expert Dan Smith of the University of Florida, do not show which candidate the voter supported, they indicate that only 16% of early in-person votes cast in Florida by Sunday night, after seven days, were by African American voters. In 2012, after only two days of early voting, the figure was 25%.</p> <p>Although the makeup of Florida\u2019s electorate has changed since 2012, Smith believes the lower than expected turnout \u2013 which matches a downturn in the early black vote in at least seven other states \u2013 is particularly worrying for Democrats in a state where recent polls suggested African American voters favoured Clinton over Trump by a 93 to 4 margin. Obama\u2019s victory over Romney in the state was by fewer than 75,000 votes and a 0.88 point margin.</p> <p>Henry Crespo, president of the Democratic Black Caucus of Florida, told the Guardian he was also concerned, noting that Obama\u2019s intensive ground strategy and black voter outreach paid dividends in 2012.</p> <p>\u201cWe are lagging based on some numbers of black early vote participation, so going into these areas is so important,\u201d he said. \u201cThe church has always been a bedrock of engaging people outside of other more traditional activities. That helps the word get out. That grandmother or that aunt or that granddad is a traditional churchgoer; if you engage that population they will ultimately engage their grandchildren, their nephews and so forth. It\u2019s a strategy that\u2019s a good approach given that we\u2019re lacking in certain areas.\u201d</p> <p>At a symbolic night rally on Tuesday at the Rev Samuel Delevoe Memorial Park, named for one of Fort Lauderdale\u2019s first black policemen who later became a civil rights leader, Clinton displayed no outward signs that she was concerned about the black vote, urging supporters: \u201cFor the next seven days focus on what is important. Don\u2019t get distracted, don\u2019t get diverted.\u201d</p> <p>For some black supporters in the crowd, however, the early voting figures were an alarm call. \u201cIt\u2019s something we\u2019re all concerned about, that\u2019s why we\u2019re all doing our best to get the word out, that we need to come together, stand together and move forward together,\u201d said Lakisha Smith, 43, a customer service representative who attended with a small group of friends and colleagues.</p>",

  "<p>Eddie Hearn has backed Dillian Whyte to become the next British fighter to win a version of the world heavyweight title as early as next year and says he is convinced that he is talented enough to beat the WBC champion Deontay Wilder and the former title holder Wladimir Klitschko.</p> <p>First off, however, Whyte must overcome the veteran Dereck Chisora, who is stubbornly eyeing another crack at a world title himself despite appearing on the slide at 32. As Chisora warned his opponent: \u201cI\u2019ve lost six fights and people wrote me off but I\u2019m like herpes.

  "<p>How can you tell if an artist means it in 2016? Independent pop has grown so referential that it can be hard to tell deference from critique. </p> <p>For a while, Melbourne group Client Liaison seemed an amusement belonging to the second category. They wear flamboyant curls and dress like an RSL Wham! cover band. Their music sounds like Video Hits circa 1989: club-indebted, fossilised chart pop both dreamy and assertive, aspirational and relaxed. <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/clientliaison/videos/1264616716934043/\">The video used to promote this debut album</a> is a laboured parody of 1980s corporate-chic, goading the amusement of a generation who thought American Psycho was funnier than it was alarming. </p> <p>So yeah, Diplomatic Immunity sounds a bit crap on paper. Like many of their contemporaries, Client Liaison trades in an outmoded pop idiom and, typically enough, that idiom originates from the late 1980s. It\u2019s a popular period to parody because it threw up the likes of Rick Astley, George Michael and hundreds of tracks from the Stock Aitken Waterman production line. This ilk can\u2019t help but evoke Reagan and Thatcher: the looming inevitability of immaculately groomed neoliberalism, the way it painted the world a peculiar shade of corporate blue. Chart pop of this era recalls these regimes, making it an attractive period for modern artists to revisit and repurpose.</p> <p>Sadly, it\u2019s no longer 1988 \u2013 and Client Liaison isn\u2019t really a group from the past. Opening track Canberra Won\u2019t Be Calling Tonight samples a 2014 exchange between the former immigration minister Scott Morrison and the Labor senator Kim Carr during <a href=\"http://www.radioaustralia.net.au/international/radio/program/pacific-beat/australian-immigration-minister-gives-little-away-to-senate-committee/1257582\">a Senate hearing</a> into withheld documents related to Operation Sovereign Borders.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"49e4f61872dca1664745f981313d21af9353f380\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/49e4f61872dca1664745f981313d21af9353f380/0_552_3840_4798/800.jpg\" alt=\"Monte Morgan and Harvey Miller, the core members of Client Liaison\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Monte Morgan and Harvey Miller, the core members of Client Liaison</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Remote Control Records</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Carr\u2019s pummelling of Morrison is deliberately foregrounded, but its presence at the beginning of the album seems to preface a direction the duo never really travels in. Instead, the present is kept at a safe distance throughout: the liner notes are festooned with drawings of Fosters cans, water coolers and giant wireless telephones, as well as a botched-up letter from former governor-general Bill Hayden granting the duo diplomatic immunity.</p> <p>Juxtaposed with its backdrop of a cheerful late 80s house, that Senate hearing sample is an interesting choice. In Australia, our 1980s were different \u2013 and with the benefit of hindsight, utopian. We operated under a prime minister still mythologised as an authentic schooner skolling alpha-bloke \u2013 indeed, one half of Client Liaison <a href=\"https://acclaimmag.com/music/after-dark-feature-interview-client-liaison/\">has described</a> Bob Hawke\u2019s famous beer skolling incident, perhaps in jest, as a big influence on the group\u2019s music. In the 1980s, at the height of our short-lived cultural export boom, we were somebody. We were Crocodile Dundee, Yahoo Serious, Kylie, Merv Hughes, Scott and Charlene. These are exemplars of our charm to many of the era.</p> <p>Client Liaison evokes that period relentlessly. Tracks such as Wild Life and A Foreign Affair \u2013 the latter featuring Tina Arena \u2013 bulge with a faintly sad optimism, an elusive hope borne of less complex times.</p> <p>Molding their songs from the soft focus ambience of late 80s club and house palettes, Client Liaison is capable of producing very beautiful pop music, suffused with a powerful combination of dancefloor vigour and bittersweet nostalgia. But the kitsch veneer can become distracting, even annoying. The duo\u2019s affectations threaten to bury the genuine, earnest pleasures these songs have to offer; to have to stop and wonder whether they\u2019re serious during a track like Home \u2013 a lusciously smooth jam recalling Pet Shop Boys\u2019 moodier material \u2013 makes it harder to love.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywMAAEIb5YE\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ywMAAEIb5YE?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p> And while there are no stinkers on Diplomatic Immunity, one begins to wonder whether Australia\u2019s independent music scene will ever tire of revisiting our past as salve for its present identity crisis \u2013 whether it be the antiquated pub rock of Bad Dreems, the new wave aping Shining Bird or the carefully channeled 1990s grunge of Violent Soho, to name just a few examples. Settler Australians may find little to love about themselves in the modern age, but this reflexive pillaging of the past for remnants of an uncompromised self does not bode well for our mental health, nor the longevity of our art. </p> <p>Of course, that may sound like a thoroughly neurotic hang up to you, in which case Diplomatic Immunity is among the best pop records Australia will get this year. Client Liaison is great without the retro window dressing, and a strange dilemma with it. </p> <p>Either way, the songs are undeniable. </p> <p><em>\u2022 Diplomatic Immunity is out on 4 November through Remote Control</em></p>",

May chose to delay, perhaps on the advice of Whitehall civil servants understandably anxious about the scale of the challenge of the negotiations.</p> <p>But by stringing out the process, while appearing to give MPs and the public as little information as possible about the government\u2019s stance, she has riled many in her own party.</p> <p>Meanwhile, by carrying out such a sweeping reshuffle when she arrived in No 10, she has peopled the back benches with articulate advocates of a different, more collegiate approach \u2013 such as those sacked in the reshuffle, including Nicky Morgan, Anna Soubry and George Osborne, who have all begun to flex their muscles.</p> <p>There have been other early indicators of a less-than-sure political touch, too: May blundered into a row with the Bank of England\u2019s governor, Mark Carney, by breaking the convention that politicians don\u2019t comment on monetary policy, expressing concerns in her conference speech she had concerns about quantitative easing.</p> <p>She struck a pose as the champion of the people against big business but watered down Cameron\u2019s planned obesity strategy so radically that even supermarkets said they would have liked tougher regulation.</p> <p>On Heathrow, she partially suspended cabinet collective responsibility and shelved the idea of an immediate vote for fear of the scale of opposition in her own party. She still lost an MP over it and then chose not to stand a candidate against him. It hardly looks like deft political management.</p> <p>And over a series of other questions: from Hinkley Point C to Amber Rudd\u2019s language on immigration; to the Orgreave non-inquiry; to the secret Nissan deal; somehow the political dots haven\u2019t quite joined up.</p> <p>Whitehall insiders say, despite May\u2019s loathing of Cameron\u2019s \u201cchumocracy\u201d, that key decisions are made by a tight clique of close allies and are not always subjected to the test of open, robust debate.</p> <p>If the supreme court upholds Thursday\u2019s ruling, No 10 has conceded that the \u201clogical conclusion\u201d will be to place a bill on triggering article 50 before both houses of parliament. But to have been dragged into doing so is not a great look. One pro-remain MP muttered darkly yesterday: \u201cAt best, she\u2019s been very badly advised.\u201d</p>",

He used to be a fine player. Darmian is another with a chance to seize, although Antonio Valencia has been one of United\u2019s most reliable performers so far this season. Pogba has presumably been kept in the starting lineup because the manager figures he needs as many games as possible to hone his role in the team. Rooney has been included to attract a bid in January (joke!) and Martial could do with getting his groove back. Central defence has the makings of a good sketch. Let\u2019s see what Fenebahce can do with it. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"145a8c076b8b98283af5c0af9264f8cfe7ca9d5d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/145a8c076b8b98283af5c0af9264f8cfe7ca9d5d/0_9_2293_1508/1000.jpg\" alt=\"David De Gea and Fenerbahce\u2019s Robin van Persie embrace before the match.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"658\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">David De Gea and Fenerbahce\u2019s Robin van Persie embrace before the match.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Boyers/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-11-03T17:41:49.148Z\">at 5.41pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-581b6df7e4b029b92ca4536d\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-03T17:04:34.811Z\">5.04pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Teams</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Fener</strong>: Volkan; Sener, Kjaer, Skrtel, Hasan Ali; Josef, Mehmet Topal, Alper; Lens, Sow, Sen</p> <p><em><strong>Subs</strong>: Fabiano, Van Persie, Koybasi, Emenike, Neustadter, Ucan, Stoch</em></p> <p><strong> United</strong>: De Gea; Darmian, Blind, Rojo, Shaw; Schneiderlin, Herrera, Pogba; Martial, Rooney, Rashford </p> <p><em><strong> Subs:</strong> Romero, Jones, Fellaini Mata, Mkhitaryan, Young, Ibrahimovic</em></p> <p><strong> Referee</strong>: M Mazic (Serbia)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"af108e9e8b0ce6dbbd37547770fd8c55ddb9fe57\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/af108e9e8b0ce6dbbd37547770fd8c55ddb9fe57/0_101_3851_2500/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Phil Jones is back on the United bench after a knee ligament injury.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"649\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Phil Jones is back on the United bench after a knee ligament injury.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Boyers/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-11-03T17:40:07.909Z\">at 5.40pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-581b3d20e4b0d073c27d116a\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-03T13:38:50.663Z\">1.38pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Preamble</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Hello and welcome to a dicey match for Manchester United. They strolled past Fenerbahce at Old Trafford a couple of weeks ago but the Turkish side are a different beast at home, as United know well thanks to previous defeats there. The last one was back in 2004 when United featured David Bellion, Liam Miller, Eric Djemba-Djemba and a seemingly hopeless defender called Gerard Piqu\u00e9. Undeterred by that precedent \u2013 because Sunday\u2019s Premier League trip to Swansea is more important - Jose Mourinho may omit several regular starters today, though he\u2019ll not be so cavalier as to include Memphis Depay, who\u2019s sitting on the naughty step back in Manchester. </p> <p>A win for United would not clinch qualification for the next round but would make it probable, and that is not to be sniffed at given that the Europa League could be their best chance of reaching next season\u2019s Champions League. You\u2019ll know today\u2019s lineup just as soon as we do, then we\u2019ll reconvene for further discussions. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/nov/02/memphis-depay-manchester-united-fenerbahce\">Memphis Depay\u2019s Manchester United future in doubt after Fenerbahce exclusion</a> </p> </aside> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-11-03T16:37:46.136Z\">at 4.37pm GMT</time></p>  </div>",

Cries of \u201cbetrayal\u201d and \u201ca war on democracy\u201d <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23brexit&amp;src=tyah\" title=\"\">swamp Twitter</a>, in a way that suggests that those who campaigned in the name of sovereignty are remarkably reluctant to accept what that sovereignty means. Now the high court has issued a short and forceful corrective that, for the sake of clarity, can be summarised like this: because parliament is sovereign, unrestrained executive power can only be used in matters where parliament has no say. Parliamentary sovereignty means that primary legislation, like the act that subordinated some UK law to Europe\u2019s in 1972, cannot be overturned just on the government\u2019s say so. Therefore the government cannot invoke article 50 without parliament\u2019s authority.</p> <p>Brexiters\u2019 cries of foul ignore the facts. Both sides accepted that the case was within the court\u2019s jurisdiction. They agreed too that it was a matter only of how, not if, article 50 should be invoked. This was no backdoor attempt to reverse the outcome of&#xa0;the referendum. There was no conspiracy. Rather, three of the most senior judges in England and Wales heard arguments on both sides from some of the best legal minds in the&#xa0;country and unanimously agreed that the law demanded parliament had a say.</p> <p>The decision was expressed with such force and clarity that it is hard to imagine a successful appeal. For that reason alone, the government is wrong to insist it is going to try anyway, a decision that will make it even harder to meet the prime minister\u2019s pledge to trigger article 50 by the end of March. That means a four-day hearing of the full court, currently eleven permanent justices. Scotland, Wales and possibly Northern Ireland are all likely to want to be involved, exacerbating division. And each session will be live-streamed in full view of global markets eager to trade on uncertainty.</p> <p>Instead of continuing an expensive and time-consuming fight in an attempt to seek legitimacy for riding roughshod over parliament, the government would be much wiser to do what it should have done from the start and ask for parliament\u2019s approval to start negotiations on the basis of a clear explanation of what it hopes to achieve. However, the overwhelming political question remains how to manage the consequences of the referendum in a way that heals rather than deepens differences, and in the context of the narrative of betrayal so eagerly fostered by some of her MPs and activists, the prime minister may believe it is better to be seen to fight all the way even if she ends up with the same result. Yet at some point soon, she must stand up to the insatiable zealots in the debate and confront them with her vision for Britain\u2019s future relationship with the EU, and she must do it in parliament.</p> <p>Meanwhile the government\u2019s business managers will be aghast. They know they will be unlikely to get away with a simple vote of both houses. It might appear the least-cost option, but while the high court\u2019s judgement is carefully non-prescriptive, it indicates that new legislation is necessary. If the government thinks differently, it risks another legal challenge. Yet getting a bill of this consequence through parliament, however short and apparently non-committal it is, conjures up a long vista of revolt and negotiation that is likely to extinguish hopes of any other legislative initiative for the rest of the session.</p> <p>But now, those MPs \u2013 a majority \u2013 who supported remain are handed the challenge of holding the government to account without feeding into the Brexiters\u2019 conspiracy theories. In particular, it is time for Labour, not least because it is the official opposition, to get on and agree a clear position. Some pro-remain MPs like Nick Clegg who has made much of the running in this debate would like a cross-party alliance around a demand for a second referendum to approve the final deal, and a commitment to staying in the single market. That may be hard for Jeremy Corbyn to accept. But, not least because an early election is back on the cards, he must as a matter of urgency set out what he does want, and how Labour will judge the government\u2019s approach. It is time for a&#xa0;strategy rather than a series of important but piecemeal demands. Parliament is back where it should be, at the heart of the debate. Now Labour must be in the thick of the contest, bold and principled in support of the&#xa0;national interest.</p>",

  "<p>One Olympic cycle can make a massive difference. In late autumn 2012, the World Cup at the Chris Hoy velodrome in Glasgow bookended a summer of golden glory for British cyclists in which Sir Bradley Wiggins had won the Tour de France for the first time, Mark Cavendish had worn the rainbow jersey to great effect, and the track events at the London Olympics had been dominated to the extent that the opposition were reduced to muttering darkly about \u201cspecial wheels\u201d.</p> <p>Four years on, Great Britain are again in Glasgow, where racing started on Thursday night with a team pursuit qualifying session for men and women but in a different context. The team are headless.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/nov/02/british-cycling-performance-director-job-advertisement\" title=\"\">post of performance director was advertised</a> this week, six months after Shane Sutton stepped down as the coach over allegations of \u201cinappropriate and discriminatory language\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/28/british-cycling-upholds-complaint-shane-sutton-jessica-varnish\" title=\"\">upheld a week ago by an inquiry</a>.</p> <p>An inquiry into the background to the Sutton saga is under way, and on Thursday night he indicated his intention to appeal. At the Rouleur Classic exhibition in London, he told the Press Association: \u201cI can categorically state I never made those comments I was originally alleged to have made. I\u2019m pretty sure people will be sitting back going \u2018well, he\u2019s going to appeal\u2019 \u2013 which is going to happen now. I will take it from there. I will produce the evidence. Everything comes out in the dirty washing. I am quite sure the evidence this time will prevail and I will win.\u201d</p> <p>The other architect of the 2012 triumphs, Sir Dave Brailsford \u2013 who left British Cycling in 2014 \u2013 is in a precarious position at Team Sky as UK Anti-Doping investigates the delivery of a package containing an undisclosed \u201cmedical product\u201d to the team.</p> <p>It is also likely the culture, media and sport parliamentary select committee will question British Cycling in December over therapeutic use exemptions after the revelation that Wiggins had an injection of the corticosteroid triamcinolone immediately before his 2012 Tour victory and on two other occasions close to major target events; the substance was taken within anti-doping rules after a TUE and no offence was committed, but criticism has been widespread.</p> <p>Finally, along with a new team head, the governing body is looking for a chief executive after Ian Drake announced he would leave in April next year.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/nov/02/british-cycling-performance-director-job-advertisement\">British Cycling seeks a new head committed to \u2018equality and diversity\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This looks like turmoil but there is one key constant: domination of the Olympic medal table. With 12 medals including six golds won in Rio by GB cyclists, Glasgow in 2016 is a case of <em>plus ca change, plus c\u2019est la m\u00eame chose</em> and the riders travelled north from Manchester this week knowing as in 2008, as in 2012, the results are very much on their side whatever else is going on.</p> <p>This explains why, for example, the team pursuit gold medallist Katie Archibald, the only member of the Olympic squad racing in Glasgow this weekend, feels insulated from recent events. \u201cWe are all on a high,\u201d she said. \u201cEvery British track cyclist at Rio won a medal. It\u2019s a big wave we can coast on for a while. The political dramas seem bizarre. As a rider you talk to your coach for the day\u2011to-day things and so you don\u2019t feel any effect. You end up reading about it in the press, reading the stories and so you see it as external. That\u2019s credit to the atmosphere at British Cycling \u2013 the riders aren\u2019t concerned by politics, they are concerned by training. Needing a new performance director doesn\u2019t bother me.\u201d</p> <p>This is home turf for Archibald, who comes from Milngavie on Glasgow\u2019s north-west outskirts. She concedes readily she is \u201cflying\u201d after winning the women\u2019s omnium and the individual pursuit at the European Championships in Paris and dominating the women\u2019s events at the recentLondon Six\u2011Day. \u201cI\u2019ve done every superstitious dance I can to hold that form for this weekend. After this I have to accept that [team pursuit] training will kick in again.\u201d</p> <p>The local crowd will get to see Archibald racing the scratch on Sunday night and the Madison on Saturday, a significant moment as the two-rider relay is a new if belated addition to the women\u2019s schedule and this is the first time a fully international field will contest the event. The weekend will also see the first running of an omnium at World Cup level under the new format, in which it is cut to one day and four endurance races, with a new discipline, the tempo race, appearing alongside the scratch, points and elimination.</p> <p>Even though her strongest event, the individual pursuit, has gone, Archibald has her sights on the omnium in the long term, in spite of her team-mate Laura Trott\u2019s dominance in the past five years: \u201cSince I\u2019ve been on my bike I\u2019ve wanted to be the best. [Saying] that is something people shy away from because journalists say they want to knock so-and-so off their throne, but it\u2019s something I will train for, that and the individual pursuit.\u201d</p> <p>Together with the team pursuiter Andy Tennant, the 22-year-old Archibald is, in terms of race experience, effectively the senior member of a youthful Great Britain team made up mainly of members of the under-23 academies. They have travelled without any up-and-coming women sprinters. Filling that gap will, no doubt, be on the to-do list of the next performance director but for the next three days racing should take precedence over politics.</p>",
  "<p>What a surprise, the great British consumer did not retreat into a bunker after the vote for Brexit in June. He and she kept on eating, drinking and buying houses as if nothing of great significance had happened. \u201cFor households, the signs of an economic slowdown are notable by their absence,\u201d admitted governor Mark Carney, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/03/bank-of-england-rate-cuts-2017-growth-forecast-inflation\">struggling to explain</a> why the Bank of England\u2019s forecast in August that short-term growth in the UK economy would come to a near standstill was wrong by an embarrassing margin.</p> <p>Sympathy for the forecasters should be limited. It is true that referendums, especially ones that lead to the defenestration of a prime minister, don\u2019t happen often. But, come on, it was hardly fanciful to think consumers might disregard, for a while, the dangers of an actual exit from the European Union if the event was pencilled in to happen only in 2019.</p> <p>Real incomes are still rising (for now) and experience suggests UK consumers tend to stay on the dancefloor until the music stops. Such behaviour is possibly imprudent in the face of a 20% fall in the exchange rate but most Britons, unlike Bank officials, do not spend their days modelling inflationary pass-through effects.</p> <p>Indeed, for homeowners with variable-rate mortgages, the first direct financial impact of the referendum was a small reduction in monthly payments after the quarter-point cut in Bank rate in August. Carney and co can take some small credit for a successful intervention but their short-term forecasting misjudgment remains severe. Wisely, the governor did not claim to have saved the nation from the gloom he predicted. The positives \u201care neither solely due, nor totally unrelated to\u201d the Bank\u2019s actions, was as far as he dared fudge it.</p> <p>If Threadneedle Street couldn\u2019t tell what lay around the next corner, should we trust its projections for 2017 and 2018? Actually, yes, we should. Those inflation models aren\u2019t perfect but it\u2019s not hard to predict what will happen when the pound is down by a fifth. Prices will rise. The Bank foresees a peak for inflation of 2.75% in mid-2018, which is lower than some in the City expect. But it will be quite enough to squeeze living standards. On that score, believe the Bank.</p> <h2>Pension Regulator\u2019s patience finally snaps </h2> <p>So much for \u201cthe light in the tunnel\u201d that Sir Philip Green claimed to spot as long ago as June in his negotiations with the Pensions Regulator over the deficit in the BHS fund. He was still seeing rays of optimism in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/18/sir-philip-green-hints-bhs-pension-deal-close-in-bid-to-save-knighthood\">his interview with ITV a few weeks ago</a> but the regulator told him to check his vision. \u201cWe are yet to receive a comprehensive and credible written proposal and have made clear what we require,\u201d it said, hinting that its patience was wearing thin.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"deb168c1820269b0895557d8ee5656dd697fb29b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/deb168c1820269b0895557d8ee5656dd697fb29b/0_0_1446_868/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sir Philip Green\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sir Philip Green said he would \u2018sort\u2019 the pension deficit out in 2014.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Reuters Tv/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Now it has snapped. The regulator <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/02/philip-green-may-be-forced-to-pay-money-into-bhs-pension-scheme\">has launched formal legal proceedings</a> against Green (plus a company controlled by his wife, and also against Dominic Chappell, the former bankrupt whose outfit bought BHS for \u00a31).</p> <p>Green suggests he can\u2019t understand the fuss. He says he\u2019s put forward \u201ca credible and substantial proposal, with evidence and bank confirmation of cash availability\u201d. The Topshop tycoon seems to have misunderstood how the process works. It is not for him to decide what counts as credible and substantial \u2013 that\u2019s the regulator\u2019s role.</p> <p>As far as we can tell, the dispute involves fundamental questions, like the size of the initial lump sum to cover the deficit. If so, the regulator is right to issue warning notices. Green first started talking about his plan to \u201csort\u201d the deficit back in 2014 when he (or, rather, his Monaco-based wife) still owned BHS. The farce has run too long already. It\u2019s now time to discover if the regulator\u2019s powers of compulsion are as strong as they ought to be.</p> <h2>FCA picks up baton dropped by CMA</h2> <p>The Competition and Markets Authority\u2019s proposals to enliven the banking sector were feeble, almost everybody agrees (apart from the report\u2019s authors, of course). Now, even the Financial Conduct Authority seems to have sided with the doubters. The City regulator <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/03/fca-banks-credit-overdraft-fees\">will study whether it should impose a cap on overdraft fees</a>, an idea the CMA rejected in its summer report.</p> <p>The two bodies perform different roles, so all sides can pretend politely that there is no fundamental disagreement. But, as the watchful Treasury select committee chair Andrew Tyrie says, it looks as if the FCA is picking up a baton dropped by the CMA. Indeed, the FCA\u2019s inquiry could quickly become a wider review of where else the CMA failed. That would be very welcome. </p>",

However, sources with knowledge of their situation said both men voiced their safety concerns internally but believed they were not being taken seriously enough and so took the decision no longer to work at the stadium.</p> <p>West Ham\u2019s opening matches at the stadium have been overshadowed by complaints that its layout and some of its policing and stewarding arrangements have been inadequate, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/26/west-ham-chelsea-efl-cup-match-report\" title=\"\">culminating in ugly scenes</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/oct/27/six-areas-of-contention-west-ham-united-london-stadium\" title=\"\">many supporters feeling in danger</a> at the EFL Cup game with Chelsea last week. Initial problems included police not having adequate radio signal around the stadium, and there are worries the stewarding operation is not experienced enough, as many of the 300 stewards who formerly worked for West Ham at the Boleyn Ground have not moved across to Stratford.</p> <p>On Tuesday the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/nov/01/sadiq-khan-mayor-london-west-ham-stadium-inquiry\" title=\"\">announced an inquiry into the financing</a> of the stadium, which has now cost \u00a3752m and been handed over to West Ham for a \u00a315m one-off payment and \u00a32.5m annually, which covers the whole operation and maintenance, including stewarding and policing. Khan\u2019s investigation is particularly focusing on the escalating cost of the retractable seating, constructed over the retained athletics track, which has risen from a projected \u00a3300,000 each time to as much as a projected \u00a38m.</p> <p>Baker, who became the official safety officer in November 2014, was in his post for Rugby World Cup and rugby league matches held last year, and for the <a href=\"http://www.raceofchampions.com/news/latest-news/london-to-stage-2015-race-of-champions-at-the-former-olympic-stadium/\" title=\"\">Race of Champions motor racing event</a> for which the seats over the track were retracted. The system now installed involves the seats being moved manually rather than hydraulically, and Baker is thought to have been concerned the track itself and parts of the lower tier had been damaged in the process. When the issue was not dealt with to his satisfaction, his concerns are said to have grown over Newham council\u2019s oversight role, and he resigned.</p> <p>Sharma, who was one of several deputy safety officers and worked at the London Stadium on a contract when fixtures and duties at Stoke City\u2019s bet365 Stadium permitted, took the role of safety officer at the AC/DC concert, the Guardian understands. He is said to have been unhappy about the levels of policing in the Olympic Park itself, the approach to the stadium and around it, and the management of the crowd when entering and leaving.</p> <p>Since 96 people died at Hillsborough in 1989 and the subsequent report by Lord Justice Taylor on safety, all major stadiums must be certified as safe according to strict statutory standards applied by the relevant local authority, and must have a full-time, qualified, designated safety officer. Newham council\u2019s position is not unique in being the legal safety licensing authority for a stadium in which it has an ownership, and such potential conflicts of interest have to be managed to ensure there is no compromise with safety.</p> <p>A Newham council spokeswoman said its co-ownership of the stadium \u201cin no way impacts on [our] role in monitoring safety which we take very seriously\u201d. The council\u2019s safety role, she said, is fulfilled by specialist, qualified officers, while its commercial interest in the stadium is managed by the ownership vehicle E20 which, she said, \u201coperates independently\u201d.</p> <p>West Ham and LS185, the contracted stadium operator for whom Baker and Sharma were working, stressed the safety of its arrangements and experience of the officers who replaced them. The stadium\u2019s head of safety and security, Steve Riley, is a former match commander at Chelsea and safety officer at Fulham, and he and the safety officer, Peter Smith, are former Metropolitan police officers. Graham Harris, who replaced Sharma as a deputy safety officer, previously worked for three years in safety and security management at Wembley stadium.</p> <p>The stadium owner E20, owned 35% by Newham council, 65% by the London Legacy Development Company \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/nov/03/london-stadium-chairman-david-edmonds-resigns-costs-investigation\" title=\"\">whose chairman, David Edmonds, resigned</a> on Thursday following Khan\u2019s announcement of an inquiry \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.whufc.com/News/Articles/2016/September/15-September/E20-confirm-Chris-Allison-CBE-appointment\" title=\"\">appointed the former Metropolitan police commissioner Chris Allison</a> in September to oversee safety and security, following the crowd problems at West Ham\u2019s first matches.</p> <p>A club spokesperson said: \u201cWest Ham United are satisfied with London Stadium\u2019s current safety team and their experience to manage the safety at our matches.\u201d</p> <p>The Sports Grounds Safety Authority, a government agency responsible for overseeing compliance with the law, sits on the London Stadium\u2019s safety advisory group, which is chaired by Newham council.

The next general election is now much more likely to be a verdict on Theresa May\u2019s Brexit stance, a prospect that ought to focus opposition party minds as well as the prime minister\u2019s. That election could now take place earlier than May had originally intended. A second vote on the eventual Brexit terms, either in parliament or even another referendum, is also more likely. It\u2019s even possible that Brexit itself just got a bit less inevitable. That\u2019s still a distant prospect, but maybe it\u2019s worth a little flutter.</p> <p>The judges have done something else. By asserting that the UK parliament has sovereignty over a treaty issue with domestic implications, the court was in fact merely restating a fundamental principle. The precedent on which the court drew went back to Sir Edward Coke in the early 17th century and to the bill of rights of 1688-89. This is why the ruling is unlikely to be overturned in the government\u2019s appeal to the supreme court. It may even be strengthened.</p> <p>That Thursday\u2019s ruling was needed at all is a reminder of how much in the British political and democratic system still needs fixing. On the one hand the judgment reopens the issue of the medieval prerogative powers that ministers continue to claim for themselves over Britain\u2019s place in an increasingly interconnected world. These powers have no place in an open 21st-century democracy.</p> <p>After Iraq, no prime minister can in practice take Britain to war without the authority of parliament. After this ruling, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/nov/03/high-court-brexit-ruling-what-does-it-all-mean\">no prime minister can secretly renegotiate</a> one of the most all-embracing treaties, the 1972 European Communities Act, ever made by the UK either.

If ever there were an example of the way referendums create at least as many problems and cause at least as much instability as they resolve, here it was.</p> <p>Parliament is far from perfect, but it is a lot better at making good, stabilising decisions than referendums, which give too much power to a biased and bad media of the kind we have here.

Parliamentary sovereignty is a phrase that is more used than understood, let alone exercised. If you need proof, look at the Brexiters\u2019 response to the court ruling. If there is one thing that united all wings of the leave campaign this year it was the belief that Britain should make its own decisions and \u201ctake back control\u201d.

  "<p>Last month I launched an historic action in the federal court of Australia against the National Archives of Australia, calling for the release of correspondence between the governor general Sir John Kerr and the Queen at the time of the dismissal of the Whitlam government.</p> <p>More than 40 years have passed since Kerr took that extraordinarily divisive step, and in that time the history of the dismissal has been fundamentally recast through archival revelations and posthumously released interviews.

We still have a long way to go and I encourage everyone to support this case and help us reclaim our history.<br></p> <p>This case is about more than just the immediate issue of ensuring public access to the palace letters, important though that is, it is also about ensuring the principle of public access to correspondence between the governor general and the monarch once and for all. Without such a case we would continue in the untenable situation for a democracy in which we do not control access to our own history.<br></p> <p>Of singular importance in the letters, should we succeed, will be to know exactly what Kerr told the Queen. Did he set out for her faithfully and completely all that he failed to reveal to the Australian public? Did Kerr tell the Queen for instance of his secret meetings and conversations with Mason; of his meetings with chief justice Sir Garfield Barwick in defiance of Whitlam\u2019s advice; of his secret telephone communications with Fraser which both men denied for decades?</p> <p>And did he tell the Queen of Whitlam\u2019s decision to call the half-Senate election which was to be announced in the House of Representatives on the afternoon of 11 November 1975? Did Kerr craft the same narrative for royal consumption that he established in his memoirs and his numerous apologia and which we now know, from material in his own papers, to be self-serving, specious and untrue?<br></p> <p>Malcolm Turnbull has said that he supports the release of the palace letters and that he does not believe they are \u201cpersonal\u201d. In an unedifying display of quasi-colonial royal deference Turnbull, an avowed republican, has proposed a formal approach to the Queen requesting that she release our own records. Instead of subjecting us to such an appalling spectacle of national humiliation, I suggest that the prime minister join with me in this action in our own courts and urge the national archives to release the palace letters.</p> <p>\u2022 Donations in support of the legal challenge can be made at <a href=\"https://chuffed.org/project/release-the-palace-letters\">https://chuffed.org/project/release-the-palace-letters</a>.

  "<p>Increasing numbers of people have been warming to the notion that Brexit may not have to mean Brexit after all. This was probably inevitable given that those who voted for it did so for a very wide range of reasons, and it is abundantly clear that the cabinet is about as unclear as the rest of us. The announcement that the UK government has lost its high court case about article 50 (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/nov/03/parliament-must-trigger-brexit-high-court-rules\" title=\"\">Report</a>, 3 November, theguardian.com) means that, subject to appeal, it will have to be debated in parliament. This presents a golden opportunity for MPs to throw a spanner in the works by refusing to vote for article 50 to be triggered without knowing precisely, or at least, generally, what Brexit will actually look like. When&#xa0;we know the awful truth I predict a stampede towards Brexit exit.</p> <p>Any arguments about this thwarting the will of the people needs to be shown up for the nonsense it is. It would not be thwarting the will of the 48% who voted against and, I suspect, a high proportion of those who voted to leave didn\u2019t vote for hard Brexit, having believed some of the lies of leading Brexiters. Perhaps we can still pull back from the brink if parliament is prepared to face the fury of Ukip and the Tory right, two groups that are increasingly difficult to tell apart.<br><strong>Alan Healey</strong><br><em>Bishops Castle, Shropshire</em></p> <p>\u2022 The high court decision is not about whether we stay in or leave the EU, it is about common sense. I have always been a reluctant remainer \u2013 not against Brexit as such, I simply believe that the decision was reached in a fatally flawed way, partly because the leave campaign never had to explain exactly what leave would mean. People were being asked to&#xa0;vote for a blind option.</p> <p>We can\u2019t turn back time and redo the referendum, but at least if there is a full debate in parliament we will get a proper discussion on the reasons for leaving and the options for the future. It is highly likely that parliament will vote to leave, but at least the decision will have been reached in something close to a proper process. This could make a big difference in healing the fractured and politically intolerant mood that has emerged in the country since the vote.<br><strong>Ken Abbott</strong><br><em>Portishead, Somerset</em></p> <p>\u2022 Claims that the high court ruling is an attempt to scupper Brexit altogether are ridiculous. In addition to committing the cardinal sin of defining a word using the word itself (\u201cBrexit means Brexit\u201d), the government has also made no sense when arguing against parliamentary ratification of article 50.</p> <p>Theresa May has stated, rather patronisingly, that any negotiator knows you should not show your hand to those on the other side of the table before negotiations have even begun. She is correct.</p> <p>However, it is not implicit that anyone but parliament is able to see our negotiating hand. Parliament is able to sit in private, meaning only MPs may be present and no media coverage may take place. This was done in 2001 when MPs debated the anti-terrorism, crime and security bill.</p> <p>Parliamentary involvement in Brexit will not reverse the referendum result, it will simply scrutinise the terms of withdrawal and it can be achieved without showing our hand to the EU.<br><strong>Gabriel Osborne</strong><br><em>Bristol</em></p> <p>\u2022 \u201cBrexit means Brexit\u201d is a meaningless and unhelpful phrase and today\u2019s high court judgment reminds us of this. Two words, one repeated, designed to make us forget the constitutional framework and legal process. Brexit (a consultative referendum) means (voted for by a narrow majority) Brexit (that we should leave the EU without further parliamentary scrutiny or consideration of the implications or constitutional foundations of the vote).</p> <p>Our constitution, despite being unwritten, is based in law. Parliament (not the government) decided to ask the public their opinion and parliament should decide what to do with this. The House of Lords must be given the chance to do its job too \u2013 if it exists at all surely it is for moments like this, to intervene and apply perspective in a situation when the government of the day is trying to do something deeply unconstitutional. And to ensure that the proper time and consideration is given to a decision with such significant consequences.</p> <p>The result of the referendum is causing divisions not just because of how deeply many people feel about the issues or that the result feels inconclusive, but because the referendum itself was not put in a robust constitutional framework, and as a result its consequences are open to debate.<br><strong>Kevin Olding</strong><br><em>London</em></p> <p>\u2022 Liam Fox and Dominic Raab don\u2019t seem to understand the high court\u2019s ruling. The nub of the matter is that the executive cannot by royal prerogative alter the rights that British citizens currently enjoy as members of the EU. The most important of these is the right to live and work freely in 28 European countries. If&#xa0;we leave the EU, Poles and Romanians will have that figure reduced from 28 to 27; British citizens meanwhile will have it reduced from 28 to 1.<br><strong>Charles Turner</strong><br><em>Associate professor of sociology, University of Warwick</em></p> <p>\u2022 What a lovely irony! Having spent months arguing for the return of British sovereignty, the Brexiters don\u2019t seem to like it much.<br><strong>Roy Boffy</strong><br><em>Sutton Coldfield, Birmingham</em></p> <p>\u2022 Whether you supported leave or remain, the decision of an unelected judge to prevent the prime minister from triggering article 50 is disgusting. Rarely has there been a clearer example of the establishment frustrating democracy and disrespecting the will (for good or ill) of the majority of the people.<br><strong>Tim Raymond</strong><br><em>Seabrook, Kent</em></p> <p>\u2022 If the government fails to overturn the decision to allow parliament a vote on article 50 in the supreme court, then they could always appeal to the European court\u2026<br><strong>Steve Flatley</strong><br><em>York </em></p> <p>\u2022 On 3 November 1774, Edmund Burke spoke as follows to the electors of Bristol:</p> <p>\u201cCertainly, gentlemen, it ought to be the happiness and glory of a representative to live in the strictest union, the closest correspondence, and the most unreserved communication with his constituents. Their wishes ought to have great weight with him; their opinion, high respect; their business, unremitted attention. It is his duty to sacrifice his repose, his pleasures, his satisfactions, to theirs; and above all, ever, and in all cases, to prefer their interest to his own. But his unbiassed opinion, his mature judgment, his enlightened conscience, he ought not to sacrifice to you, to any man, or to any set of men living. These he does not derive from your pleasure; no, nor from the law and the constitution. They are a trust from Providence, for the abuse of which he is deeply answerable. Your representative owes you, not his industry only, but his judgment; and he betrays, instead of serving you, if he sacrifices it to your opinion.\u201d<br><strong>Martin Thom</strong><br><em>Cambridge</em></p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Join the debate \u2013 email </em></strong><a href=\"mailto:guardian.letters@theguardian.com\" title=\"\"><strong><em>guardian.letters@theguardian.com</em></strong></a></p>",

It is not a decision taken lightly by me, nor by any Jew who suffered the loss of family members in the Holocaust. My grandparents, believing that the German people would see through Hitler and his thugs, chose to remain in Berlin. They were subsequently transported to Katowice in Poland, where they were slaughtered in a concentration camp.</p> <p>But that was then.

But I\u2019ve been told by the German embassy that I\u2019m not eligible to claim under this provision, as until 1953 only a German father could confer German citizenship, and I was born in 1946.

They followed that with one miraculously good record after another, and while people might disagree on where things started slipping, one could make a case for every album up to and including their 10th, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/mar/16/popandrock.shopping1\">New Adventures in Hi-Fi</a>, being a classic, and for much of their later work being unduly neglected.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"befa3746577a979aa0089c38431f324b3818305f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/befa3746577a979aa0089c38431f324b3818305f/0_250_2000_2000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Michael Stipe \u2013 and beard \u2013 in New York in 2016\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Michael Stipe \u2013 and beard \u2013 in New York in 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mireya Acierto/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Peter Buck, the guitarist who was the onstage rock\u2019n\u2019roller to Stipe\u2019s eccentric performance artist, knew from the minute they formed in 1980 \u2013 drummer Bill Berry making up the quartet \u2013 they had something remarkable in their chemistry. \u201cMichael and I had been writing songs, and Mike and Bill had played together in high school,\u201d he says down the phone \u2013 he didn\u2019t make it back to Athens. \u201cAnd we met and rehearsed, and at the end of the rehearsal we had six songs we\u2019d written. A couple of people came in, and one of them said: \u2018How long have you guys been playing together?\u2019 I said: \u2018About three-and-a-half-hours.\u2019 I\u2019m not saying we were great, but we had something, and it was the interplay of our ideas.\u201d</p> <p>If you look at it coldly, in fact, it is something of a miracle that REM could even exist \u2013 four young men, who happened to be in the same place at the same time, with a gift for combining perfectly: not just in the obvious ways, but also in how Mills\u2019s gift for counterharmony complemented Stipe (listen to the chorus of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0GFRcFm-aY\">It\u2019s the End of the World As We Know It)</a>, how Berry added yet more depth with his own harmonies, how Buck had a gift for guitar lines that sounded both timely and timeless. \u201cA very good band does hold true to the axiom: the whole is greater than the sum of the parts,\u201d Mills says. \u201cThe fact that we all met each other and formed a band is the mindblowing thing. It had to be these people, in that time, in that space, to make this happen.\u201d</p> <p>In another era, Stipe wouldn\u2019t have been a rock singer. Were he young now, he might have become a video artist, or a photographer, or some nonspecific creative type. But when rock\u2019n\u2019roll hit him in 1975, that was the obvious path for an unusual kid with an urge to make art: \u201cThat\u2019s when I thought: \u2018This is what I\u2019m gonna do.\u2019\u201d And even then, where many songwriters write because they have a burning urge to share something with the world, Stipe wrote songs for a less driven reason: \u201cI needed 12 songs for an album. And the guys would push me very hard. And I was the slowest. And I\u2019ll always be the slowest.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2229f5ee3fb55aff4c1fc2e28c4db1cb900ddb1d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2229f5ee3fb55aff4c1fc2e28c4db1cb900ddb1d/0_0_3300_1981/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The band backstage in 1984\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The band backstage in 1984.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paul Natkin/WireImage</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>You can hear that in Stipe\u2019s writing. Some REM lyrics are terrific. Some are really not very good. But what they had in their favour was Stipe\u2019s unique, oaky voice, one that could imbue pretty much any set of words with emotional force and deep resonance. Take <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rOiW_xY-kc\">Everybody Hurts</a>, a worldwide hit single so potentially platitudinous that it has become an X Factor staple: Stipe makes it sound like the most comforting and profound lyric in pop history.</p> <p>Out of Time, Stipe thinks, is where he started to write well. \u201cI had a pretty clear idea of what I was good at and how I could manifest that, but also the power of the word.\u201d He realised that \u201ca shitty nonsensical lyric\u201d could work in one song, but equally that he could deliver words that \u201cactually fucking resonated on a very deep level. And so <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CYitiDJPTE\">Country Feedback</a> resonated on a very deep level. I knew that instantly. It wrote itself. I began to realise around Document [in 1987] that I had skill and I honed it. In time it went from skill to art and my job was to forget everything and allow the instinct to take over, and that\u2019s when the great songs came. Losing My Religion was instinct, Country Feedback was instinct, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XRyEkOfQSg\">Me in Honey </a>\u2026\u201d At the time, Stipe said Out of Time was their first set of love songs. Not any more. \u201cI think I just said that. I needed a line. But they\u2019re not love songs, are they?\u201d</p> <p>It appears to gall him, still, that a lot of people remember Out of Time not for the great songs, but for the sugar-sweet bubblegum pastiche <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCQ0vDAbF7s\">Shiny Happy People</a> (\u201cI\u2019ve made my excuses over and over again and I\u2019ll go to The Hague with my excuses for that song\u201d), but it\u2019s him who brings it up, not me. And then he tries to rationalise it with an anecdote that involves James Franco making a TV series \u201cabout identical twins and the high jinks that happen\u201d, which reminded him of an Elvis Presley film about identical twins and, yes, their high jinks, about getting the name of that film wrong, but how the soundtrack to that film \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0057227/\">Kissin\u2019 Cousins</a> \u2013 was the first album he bought because he loved <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOF9lzGLz-8\">the title track</a>. \u201cIt\u2019s still a really good song. Anyway, that was Shiny Happy People.\u201d I try my best to look like I have some idea what he\u2019s talking about. \u201cI have great stories, but I\u2019m a terrible storyteller,\u201d he says, accurately.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rOiW_xY-kc\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/5rOiW_xY-kc?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Watch the video for Everybody Hurts.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Out of Time was released just as the first Gulf war got underway. It\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.remhq.com/news/25th-anniversary-reissue-of-out-of-time-due-out-november-18th-via-concord-bicycle/\">coming out again</a> at another troubled point in American life. It\u2019s a coincidence, but an odd one. \u201cWe still have a Gulf war going on,\u201d Buck observes. \u201cI\u2019m just so disgusted.\u201d Mills observes of Donald Trump that \u201che was bad enough as a private citizen, but he\u2019s much worse as a politician\u201d.</p> <p>Stipe is most damning. \u201cDonald Trump shouldn\u2019t have made it through the third week of the Republican clown car of candidates,\u201d he says. \u201cThe media jumped on him because he\u2019s a great reality TV star and we\u2019re watching the greatest reality TV show of all time unfold in real time through the American presidential election.\u201d That morning, Stipe says, his French boyfriend had told him how France needs to update the Fifth Republic. \u201cAmerica has never updated,\u201d he notes. \u201cWe\u2019re still working like the Bible or the Qur\u2019an, we\u2019re working off a set of rules from another era. We need to really seriously look at who we are and where we are and bring things up to speed.\u201d Or, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdC6thlCAlI\">as he sang on Cuyahoga 31 years ago</a>: \u201cLet\u2019s put our heads together / Start a new country up.\u201d</p> <p>REM\u2019s politics was something that defined them at the height of their fame. At the 1991 MTV video music awards, where the band won six awards, Stipe used the group\u2019s appearances to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMbYPDAaIA0\">strip off his T-shirts</a>, revealing a series of slogans \u2013 \u201cWear a condom\u201d, \u201cChoice\u201d, \u201cAlternative energy now\u201d, \u201cThe right to vote\u201d, \u201cHandgun control\u201d, \u201cLove knows no colours\u201d, \u201cRainforest\u201d. That was just the tip of the iceberg: Stipe, especially, always seemed to be talking up his favoured causes; it was something he felt was both a duty and a privilege, but it created pressures. \u201cThe hardest part was being put in the position of being \u2018the voice of a generation\u2019,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s not a pretty place to be. It\u2019s not easy. I tried. I did try to use the platform of being a public figure. But you find yourself sitting at a table, with someone saying: \u2018Describe to me the problems of global warming from a sub-Saharan perspective.\u2019 I\u2019m a pop star. That\u2019s not what I went to school for.\u201d</p> <p>When the group began, Buck had insisted on a series of guidelines \u2013 moral, ethical, personal, financial, aesthetic \u2013 that would steer them throughout their career. Some were fairly trivial \u2013 no leather onstage, so they didn\u2019t look like every other rock band. Some were crucial \u2013 sharing all songwriting credits equally, regardless of who wrote the song, so there would be no arguments about money down the line. Some of those guidelines are still in use \u2013 Buck tells me that earlier in the day we speak the group had turned down a multi-million-dollar offer to have their music soundtrack an advertising campaign (\u201cI don\u2019t want my children to see me being a whore\u201d). And it\u2019s still the case that any one of the members can veto any decision related to REM, as was the case throughout their career.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"eb47a5aae9d57f85ebcf652b3064458abfcdb528\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eb47a5aae9d57f85ebcf652b3064458abfcdb528/0_125_3032_1819/1000.jpg\" alt=\"REM at the 1991 MTV awards\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">REM, with Stipe in one of the slogan T-shirts he wore at the 1991 MTV awards.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: The LIFE Picture Collection/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>So who used the veto most often?</p> <p>\u201cI think Michael might have done it more, but as the face of the band, things affected him more than us,\u201d Mills says.</p> <p>I put that to Stipe. \u201cOoooh!\u201d His lips form a little moue, and he raps the table twice. \u201cWe had a run-in last week, me and Mike Mills,\u201d he says, and he laughs. \u201cAnd I gave in to his desires. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s the case. If he says it is, then he doesn\u2019t say things like that without a reason.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOff the top of my head, I\u2019d say Michael,\u201d Buck says. \u201cBut it might be me.\u201d</p> <p>I tell Buck that Stipe had seemed surprised when I said Mills had nominated him. \u201cHe shouldn\u2019t be. I would be fairly comfortable saying he and I would be pretty close to tied. I can rant for 10 minutes about why something is morally, ethically, culturally wrong. And Michael might just say: \u2018I don\u2019t wanna do that.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>The different members of REM took to their superstardom after Out of Time in different ways. Mills sounds as if he was utterly untroubled by it: \u201cNothing felt like it came on too fast, nothing felt like it was more than we could handle.\u201d (\u201cOf course he would,\u201d Stipe says. \u201cThat\u2019s his personality.\u201d) Buck professes to having thought \u201cit was all kind of bullshit. We just made a record \u2013 big deal. When we went around to do the next record, Automatic for the People, I just disappeared off the face of the earth. Grew a big beard and drove round in my car and flopped in motels for a year. So I never really had to confront the overwhelming nature of it until 1995 [when REM toured after six years off the road], which was mindblowing for all of us.\u201d</p> <p>Stipe, though, was the frontman, the one who had to stand in the headwind. \u201cThe face. Mike Mills called me Face. I was the recognisable one to the world at large.\u201d He relied on the other three to stop becoming, in his words, a monster. \u201cIf I believed everything that was said about me and all the adulation, anyone in that position would [become one],\u201d he says. And yet Stipe\u2019s insecurities plagued him. If a show wasn\u2019t sold out, he was horrified. \u201cIf I was going to put that much effort into it, and I did, I wanted to know that I had a rapt and captive audience. I would always, always look around and find the one person who was yawning or looking at their watch. You have to believe that what you\u2019re doing is so important that everybody is going to be absolutely and completely captivated and in the moment with you. And when you see that one person putting on their lipstick or checking their watch or talking to their girlfriend \u2026 wow.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYOKMUTTDdA\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/YYOKMUTTDdA?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Watch the video for Shiny Happy People</figcaption> </figure>   <p>He got increasingly fed up, too, with the portrayals of his public persona. He became bored with who he seemed to be, what he was saying. He wearied of being called \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/mar/06/michael-stipe-rem-collapse-interview\">enigmatic</a>\u201d by people trying to boil down his sometimes contrary, sometimes diffident personality into a single word. Recalling that causes him to reflect on his father, who shared similar traits. \u201cHis humour was really dry, and really smart,\u201d he says. \u201cHe reacted to things that he saw, and he reacted to them in a way that was hysterically funny. Most people didn\u2019t understand that. Or would take a day or two before going, \u2018Oh my God, that was really astute and hysterical.\u2019 I got a little bit of that. So the enigmatic thing I understand. But it became hideously close and I became really bored with myself, and I didn\u2019t think I had anything new to say. I\u2019d played that character. I didn\u2019t think I could do it again.\u201d</p> <p>Perhaps the one most affected was Bill Berry. He left the group in 1997, explaining simply that he wasn\u2019t enjoying it any longer. They continued without him for 14 years, in which it sometimes seemed they stumbled more than skipped. \u201cThe three-legged dog went through the meat grinder and ended up in \u2026 where\u2019s the place they grind up the bones and turn them into glue? The rendering factory,\u201d Stipe says.</p> <p>You might expect Mills, Berry\u2019s high-school friend, to have been the one who missed the drummer\u2019s presence most. He says not. \u201cI think it was harder on Peter, because Bill was the balance. Bill and Peter wanted more concision in the songs. Michael and I tended to elaborate and add more things.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe power dynamic shift that occurred between the three of us was so profound as to literally break up the band and put it back together and break it up and put it back together,\u201d Stipe says. </p> <p>\u201cNo one really wanted to listen to me,\u201d says Buck. \u201cWhich was fine. But no one really had a lot of set goals in mind either. Bill was a no-bullshit guy, and with him gone, it feels to me in retrospect that I was more aggressive than I should have been and everyone was pushing back not to have me bully them. We were all pushing in such different directions, and we were feeling such frustration and anger about it. I started backing away from the whole thing: I had to be talked out of the tree a couple of times, when I said: \u2018I don\u2019t want to do this any more.\u2019 After the 2005 tour, I was totally fed up and we just didn\u2019t talk for, I don\u2019t know, a year.\u201d</p> <p>Stipe remembers things being just as bad seven years earlier, when they made <a href=\"http://www.allmusic.com/album/up-mw0000040590\">Up</a>, their first album without Berry. \u201cWe made choices that were not great choices, because we simply weren\u2019t talking. That record really needed an editor, but we could not only not arrive at a decision, we couldn\u2019t be in the same room together. It was bad.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"905f82e6de3fc38fe5fde3d72f5a9a3c667e2fce\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/905f82e6de3fc38fe5fde3d72f5a9a3c667e2fce/0_84_4469_2682/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Live at the Milton Keynes Bowl in 1995\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Live at the Milton Keynes Bowl in 1995.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mick Hutson/Redferns</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>All three agree \u2013 they would, wouldn\u2019t they? \u2013 that REM were back on track by the time they called it a day in 2011. Their final two albums, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2008/mar/21/shopping.popandrock\">Accelerate</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/mar/03/rem-collapse-into-now-review\">Collapse Into Now</a>, seemed more in touch with what had made REM great in the first place than some of their immediate predecessors, and the three were able to part once again reconnected with what Buck describes as \u201ca deep and abiding friendship. It was nice to have nothing but the music and our friendship tying us together, as opposed to the music, the friendship, the contracts, the upcoming tour, the 300 employees we\u2019re hiring \u2013 all the other things that tend to get in the way of interpersonal relationships.\u201d</p> <p>REM gave Stipe something that nothing else ever has: adrenalin. \u201cIt\u2019s a very powerful drug,\u201d he say. \u201cAnd you have to wean yourself off it carefully. I still miss it. But, hopefully, you find other things to get excited about.\u201d Buck, for his part, longs for particular eras of the group\u2019s lifespan. \u201cI miss being in REM in 1983 and 1987. Which is to say, I miss being young and in the centre of my culture.\u201d</p> <p>What REM have left is a legacy, of both music and of how a band should comport itself, one you see replicated whenever a band with principles crosses over to a mass audience: Radiohead, for example, might consider how much they owe to REM. \u201cWe did a remarkable job of maintaining integrity throughout a very difficult period and in a difficult industry,\u201d Stipe says. \u201cWe forged a new path. We created a new way for people to look and approach this and not become an empty puppet or a dog and pony show.\u201d He pauses. \u201cWhat\u2019s the other part I\u2019m proud of?\u201d</p> <p>The records?</p> <p>Stipe looks up and laughs. \u201cYeah!\u201d</p> <p><em>The 25th anniversary deluxe edition of Out of Time is released on Universal on 18 November.

  "<p>The Bank of England has warned households to expect a sharp rise in inflation next year as the weak pound ramps up the costs of imports and squeezes family finances.</p> <p>Predicting rises in petrol prices and other goods that the UK buys in from abroad, the Bank said inflation would rise from 1.3% this year to 2.7% in 2017 and 2018, higher than in its last set of forecasts three months ago. In its new outlook, the monetary policy committee (MPC), led by the Bank\u2019s governor, Mark Carney, said it would take until 2020 for inflation to get back to the target of 2% set by the government.</p> <p>The new forecast was delivered as the Bank kept interest rates at a record low of 0.25% and dropped plans to cut them further in the near future, although the inflation warning was tempered with a projection that economic growth will be much stronger than previously forecast in the near-term. </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/06/brexit-pound-plunges-to-30-year-lows-as-eu-fears-bite-into-global-markets-again\">The pound tumbled to 30-year lows</a> in the wake of the vote to leave the EU and has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/12/pound-drops-further-after-davis-hints-uk-could-leave-single-market\">come under fresh pressure in recent weeks</a> over investor fears that the UK is heading for a hard Brexit deal that would leave it shut out of Europe\u2019s single market. The sharp depreciation has made UK exports more competitive <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/03/uk-services-costs-pound-inflation\">but imports more expensive</a> \u2013 prompting changes to inflation forecasts. </p> <p>Carney, who has been forced to fend off criticism that he was overly gloomy on the potential blow to the economy from a leave vote, said on Thursday that sterling\u2019s sharp fall made the Bank\u2019s usual balancing act more challenging. </p> <p>He described the UK as facing \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d and said the MPC was making a trade-off between keeping inflation in check and shoring up growth. For now, record-low interest rates and a big programme of electronic money printing, known as quantitative easing, was appropriate, he said.</p> <p>\u201cThe MPC is choosing a period of somewhat higher consumer price inflation in exchange for a more modest increase in unemployment. However, there are limits to the extent to which above-target inflation can be tolerated,\u201d Carney told a news conference.</p> <p>His comments about the Bank\u2019s sensitivity to inflation picking up were interpreted by investors as a signal that policymakers were in no hurry to consider cutting interest rates further. Another rate cut would likely put more pressure on the pound and further stoke price pressures in the economy.</p> <p>The pound, which had received a boost earlier in the day after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/nov/03/theresa-may-concedes-triggering-article-50-will-need-act-of-parliament\">the high court ruled that parliament should have a say over the triggering of article 50</a>, strengthened further after the Bank\u2019s statement. It rose against the dollar and euro as some economists said that 0.25% now marked the low point for interest rates and that the next move would probably be up.</p> <p>\u201cIf the relatively sanguine view presented in November\u2019s inflation report proves correct, then another interest rate cut now looks unlikely,\u201d said Paul Hollingsworth at the consultancy Capital Economics.</p> <p>\u201cGiven that we think that the economy will surprise the MPC on the upside, and that inflation may be a bit stronger too, we think that the next move in interest rates will be up, and perhaps sooner than most expect.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"47a65197f1d2173b45d0e871d440942360f7641e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/47a65197f1d2173b45d0e871d440942360f7641e/0_571_3604_2163/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mark Carney, Bank of England governor\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mark Carney said UK households had appeared to \u2018entirely look through Brexit-related uncertainties\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kirsty Wigglesworth/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/04/bank-of-england-cuts-uk-interest-rates\">Back in August</a>, when it reduced interest rates from 0.5% to 0.25%, the Bank had indicated it would support another interest rate cut to about 0.1% by the end of this year if the economy followed its predictions for a sharp slowdown. On Thursday it said that guidance had now \u201cexpired\u201d and it <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/nov/03/bank-of-england-growth-inflation-interest-rates-brexit-business-live\">revised up forecasts for economic growth</a> in the final months of this year and throughout 2017. </p> <p>That reflected a succession of business surveys and official data signalling that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/27/uk-economy-shrugs-off-brexit-uncertainty-with-05-growth\">households and companies have largely shrugged off the Brexit vote, for now,</a> although worries about the UK\u2019s longer-term prospects have dented businesses\u2019 investment plans. </p> <p>Carney commented that households had appeared to \u201centirely look through Brexit-related uncertainties\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cFor households, the signs of an economic slowdown are notable by their absence. Perceptions of job security remain strong. Wages are growing at around the same modest pace as at the start of the year. Credit is available and competitive. Confidence is solid,\u201d he said.</p> <p>But looking further ahead to 2018, the Bank said a squeeze on household incomes from higher inflation and uncertainty about the UK\u2019s future trading position would likely curb growth. Taking the near- and long-term forecasts together, the economic picture in three years\u2019 time was slightly worse than in August\u2019s outlook.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/nov/03/bank-of-england-growth-inflation-interest-rates-brexit-business-live\">Bank of England leaves interest rates unchanged and raises growth and inflation forecasts  \u2013 business live</a> </p> </aside>  <p></p> <p>The rate decision comes days after Carney was forced to end weeks of speculation about his future as governor by announcing he had agreed to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/31/mark-carney-extra-year-bank-of-england-governor\">stay on until Brexit negotiations with the EU have ended in 2019</a>.<br></p> <p>The move followed criticism from pro-Brexit campaigners and MPs unhappy at what they saw as the overpoliticisation of his role in the run-up to the EU referendum, when Carney warned a leave vote could tip the UK into recession.</p> <p>On Thursday, Carney said the independent central bank did not feel under any pressure from the government and batted away requests from reporters to further elaborate on his own career plans, saying: \u201cI think we\u2019ve had enough of that saga.\u201d</p> <p><br></p>",

Specifically, we forecast GDP growth to slow from 2.1% in 2016 to 1.1% in 2017, then improve only gradually to 1.3% in 2018 and 1.5% in 2019.

class=\"quoted\"> <p>The Bank of England abandoned plans for further cuts to interest rates as it conceded the economy had stood up to the shock of June\u2019s Brexit vote without the sharp slowdown Mark Carney and fellow policymakers had predicted.</p> <p>The Bank left rates at 0.25% as expected by investors and revised up forecasts for economic growth in the final months of this year and throughout 2017, compared with their outlook published in August. But they also warned that sterling\u2019s sharp fall would push up inflation more than previously thought. That in turn would squeeze household incomes and coupled with uncertainty about the UK\u2019s longer-term prospects outside the EU would stem economic growth in 2018. Taking the near and long-term forecasts together the economic picture in three years\u2019 time is slightly worse than in August\u2019s outlook.</p> <p>The forecasts accompanied a unanimous decision by the Bank\u2019s nine-strong monetary policy committee (MPC) to leave interest rates at 0.25%, where they had been cut to in August to shore up confidence after June\u2019s vote to leave the EU.</p> <p>In comments likely to be interpreted by financial markets as ruling out any more QE or interest rate cuts any time soon, the Bank also said it could respond \u201cin either direction\u201d to changes in the economic outlook and used minutes from its latest policy meeting to highlight how the weaker pound pushes up inflation. The Bank also said \u201cthere are limits to the extent to which above-target inflation can be tolerated.\u201d</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-581b2bd0e4b029b92ca451d9\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-03T12:23:36.660Z\">12.23pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>The Bank of England</strong> fears that the uncertainty over Brexit will push unemployment higher, from its current rate of 4.9%</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>[There is a ] risk that UK-based firms\u2019 access to EU markets could be materially reduced, which could restrain business activity and supply growth over a protracted period.</p> <p>The unemployment rate is projected to rise to around 5.5% by the middle of 2018 and to stay at around that level throughout 2019.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-581b2a02e4b029b92ca451ce\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-03T12:17:26.217Z\">12.17pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">BoE: UK is doing better than we expected</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>The Bank of England admits that the UK economy has outperformed its expectations in the three months since it slashed rates.</strong></p> <p>It says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In the three months since then, indicators of activity and business sentiment have recovered from their lows immediately following the referendum and the preliminary estimate of GDP growth in Q3 was above expectations [reminder: it was 0.5%, not 0.1%].</p> <p>These data suggest that the near-term outlook for activity is stronger than expected three months ago.

That could show the Consumer Prices Index smashing through the official 2% target next year. If that happens, how long will the Bank be prepared to ignore the rising cost of living?</p> <p>And of course, Carney can expect several questions about his decision to extend his term by an extra 12 months, to summer 2019.

I\u2019ve posted vast amounts of commentary on this already, but here is what it means in six key points.</p> <p><strong>1 - The court ruling is much more definitive than anyone expected. </strong>(See, for example, David Allen Green at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/nov/03/article-50-high-court-ruling-high-court-set-to-rule-on-whether-mps-should-vote-on-triggering-article-50-politics-live?page=with:block-581b301be4b0d073c27d112a#block-581b301be4b0d073c27d112a\">4.10pm.) </a>The government is appealing to the supreme court, but informed commentators seem to think it more likely than not that the government will lose again.</p> <p><strong>2 - Unless the government does win at the supreme court, parliament will get to legislate on invoking article 50.</strong> And that means a proper bill, passing through the Commons and the Lords, with MPs and peers getting the chance to amend it. Theresa May has been refusing to give parliament a vote on the terms of Brexit because, once power shifts from the hands of the executive to the legislature (see<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/nov/03/article-50-high-court-ruling-high-court-set-to-rule-on-whether-mps-should-vote-on-triggering-article-50-politics-live?page=with:block-581af486e4b0d073c27d0fb0#block-581af486e4b0d073c27d0fb0\"> 8.49am)</a>, the prime minister loses some control. The key point about today is that MPs and peers have, for the first time, got a strong chance of shaping the start of the Brexit process.</p> <p><strong>3 - The chances of Brexit being overturned are still very minimal.</strong> It is just about possible to conceive how the UK could stay in the EU (parliament votes to insert a second referendum clause into the article 50 Brexit bill, and some economic catastrophe results in a sharp change in public opinion by 2018) but you would be unwise to bet on it. Most MPs and peers who voted remain accept that the result of the referendum should be honoured.</p> <p><strong>4 - But the chances of Brexit being \u201csoft\u201d not \u201chard\u201d have increased significantly. </strong>There is a majority for a \u201csoft\u201d Brexit in parliament and, if there is a bill, it will now have the chance to exercise leverage.</p> <p><strong>5 - There is now a real possibility that Theresa May will not be able to trigger article 50 before the end of March. </strong>The government says it still intends to meet this deadline, but the need to legislate could lead to a delay.</p> <p><strong>6 - An early election, though by no means inevitable, now does look more likely than it did this time yesterday.</strong></p> <p>That\u2019s all from me for today. I had been intending to cover other stories, but I\u2019m afraid this one took over.</p> <p>Thanks for the comments.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-11-03T17:34:35.049Z\">at 5.34pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-581b6d57e4b029b92ca45368\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/henrymcdonald\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-03T17:03:33.973Z\">5.03pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The votes of Northern Ireland MPs in the House of Commons could prove critical if Theresa May and the government is forced to ask parliament to trigger article 50.</p> <p>All eight Democratic Unionist Party MPs are guaranteed to back Brexit in the Commons given that they were the only major political force in the Stormont Assembly to active back a leave vote in June\u2019s referendum.</p> <p>However, the position of the two Ulster Unionist MPs - Fermanagh/South Tyrone\u2019s Tom Elliott and Danny Kinahan in South Antrim - is interesting. In June UUP leader Mike Nesbitt called for a remain vote.</p> <p>The UUP has now switched position and said its MPs will back the government to allow for the referendum result to be implemented. The party will argue this is because the entire electorate of the UK has spoken in the referendum and it is their duty to back up that outcome in the Commons.</p> <p>The switch though may also be due to fears of being further outflanked by the DUP especially given a number of recent defections from the UUP to the Democratic Unionists. In essence the UUP is again moving to the right in order to slow down its decline vis a vis the DUP.</p> <p>All three SDLP MPs will definitely vote to block Brexit given that the party campaigned vigorously for remain and was involved in last week\u2019s failed legal action in the Belfast High Court to declare Brexit null and void in Northern Ireland only.</p> <p>Sinn Fein will not vote in the Commons because it boycotts the parliament although the party will come under fire accused of failing to add to the Remain voices in the chamber that could scupper Brexit.</p> <p>Yet it is the votes of the unionist bloc that will prove far more critical if and when the referendum result is tested in the House of Commons. Expect more demands from DUP first Minister Arlene Foster for special treatment for Northern Ireland (guaranteed post-Brexit farming subsidies for Ulster agriculture for instance) in order to bolster the government\u2019s numbers in a Brexit vote .... even one after a general election.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-581b6dc7e4b07ceadb3a2209\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-03T17:03:25.060Z\">5.03pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><em>Since you\u2019re here, we have a small favour to ask.

It was made unanimously by three experienced appeal judges, sitting exceptionally at first instance: they are the Lord Chief Justice, the Master of the Rolls and the leading public law judge at the court of appeal. It is reasoned and detailed. At one point, the court appears to hold that the government\u2019s case was too weak to win on its own terms, regardless of the claimants\u2019 case.</p> <p>Why did the government lose? It seems that the crucial issue is the impact on the rights of citizens. If the Article 50 <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/946c95fc-34bb-31f6-855f-ea21d58249c2\">notification is irrevocable</a> then the argument is that these rights will be removed automatically in due course. This cannot be done, other than by an Act of Parliament.</p> <p>The government could have side-stepped this difficulty by not accepting that the notification was irrevocable (and many, including Lord Kerr who wrote Article 50 of the Lisbon treaty, say a notification must be revocable). But it saw this legally sensible move as politically unacceptable. Looking at the judgment, the impression is that the government\u2019s concession on this crucial point determined the outcome of the case.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><a href=\"http://ftalphaville.ft.com/2016/11/03/2178734/after-the-high-courts-brexit-decision-forget-about-activating-article-50-in-march/\"><strong>Jolyon Maugham, the barrister and legal writer, says in a Financial Times article that if the government loses its appeal, Theresa May will not be able to trigger article 50 by the end of March as she hopes.</strong></a></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Imagine this. It is November 2018. The promised trade deals have failed to appear. Unemployment and inflation are on the rise.

Why make the decision now, with modest evidence, if you have the opportunity to make it later with more?</p> <p>These points will be debated in the Commons and they must also be debated in the Lords.</p> <p>And, in practical terms, it is difficult to contemplate that these steps \u2013 drafting a Bill, debating it in the Commons, voting on amendments, placing it before the House of Lords and then addressing amendments introduced by the Upper Chamber in the Commons again \u2013 can sensibly be taken after the result of the Supreme Court appeal is known but before March.</p> <p>So, whatever else the decision means, unless the Supreme Court overturns the High Court\u2019s decision, Theresa May\u2019s March deadline will be ancient history.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><a href=\"http://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/blog/14858/the-high-courts-ruling-v-the-governments-plan-to-trigger-article-50/\"><strong>Hannah White at the Institute of Government has a Q&amp;A on what the ruling means.</strong></a></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><strong>Will MPs and Lords vote to pass the bill?</strong></p> <p>This will of course come down to politics. Both the Commons and Lords have a majority of members who argued for the UK to remain a member of the EU. But politically, they may not wish to vote against the decision of UK voters taken through the referendum, particularly as most constituencies outside the Scotland, Northern Ireland and the major cities voted against remaining in the EU.</p> <p>Nonetheless, they will wish to ensure that the decision to trigger Article 50 receives an appropriate <a href=\"http://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/blog/14358/parliaments-role-in-the-brexit-negotiations/\">degree of parliamentary scrutiny</a>. Depending on how the bill is drafted \u2013 and it is likely to be very short \u2013 there may be moves to amend it to place conditions on the Government before it can trigger Article 50. These could take the form of timing or process requirements \u2013 for example, a requirement on the Government to provide Parliament with information about its negotiating position <a href=\"http://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/blog/14819/what-the-government-needs-to-demonstrate-before-it-pulls-the-article-50-trigger/\">before triggering Article 50</a>.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><a href=\"http://www.howtocrackanut.com/blog/2016/11/3/why-an-appeal-of-the-high-court-parliamentary-brexit\"><strong>Albert Sanchez-Graells, a law lecturer, says on his EU economic law blog that he thinks the appeal to the supreme court will lead to the European Court of Justice (or the Court of Justice of the European Union - CJEU) getting involved.</strong></a></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Now, in case of an appeal of the High Court\u2019s decision before the UKSC, in my opinion, the referral to the CJEU is legally unavoidable (I will not deal for now with arguments of judicial politics or pragmatic views on the UKSC\u2019s likely course of action). Even if the parties do not challenge or even raise to the UKSC\u2019s consideration the matter of the (ir)reversibility of and Article 50 notification, it is a logical given that the UKSC needs to take a stance (even if implicit) on this point in order to be able to rule on the case. If it quashes the High Court\u2019s decision, it needs to clarify the points of law which the High Court would have gotten wrong--one of which concerns the irrevocability of an Art 50 notification. if it upholds the High Court\u2019s decision, it is (implicitly) accepting the assumption that an Art 50 notification is irrevocable. Either way, the UKSC cannot escape a substantial (implicit) consideration of the interpretation of Article 50.</p> <p>In my view, this engages the UKSC\u2019s obligation to request a preliminary ruling from the CJEU under Article 267(3) TFEU and not doing so triggers a risk of infringement of EU law by the UK due to the acts (or omission, in this case) of its highest court.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong><a href=\"https://semipartisansam.com/2016/11/03/high-court-brexit-article-50-ruling-parliament-vote-leave-eu/\">Sam Hooper at Semi-Partisan Politics says leave campaigners should not worry too much about the judgment.</a></strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I don\u2019t really remember the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poll_Tax_Riots\">Poll Tax riots</a> toward the tail end of Thatcher\u2019s government.

I hope that this ruling will now give space to properly explore what Brexit actually means and the implications of such a momentous decision.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-581b3b6ee4b029b92ca45230\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-03T13:28:39.054Z\">1.28pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><em>Since you\u2019re here, we have a small favour to ask.

There is no basis for a further vote in parliament, other than to aid those seeking to block the path of democracy.</p> <p>Any attempts to row back on the referendum result will be met with anger and frustration by the British public.</p> <p>This is an unnecessary distraction, and this side-show must not be allowed to distract the UK Government from getting on with the job of negotiating a new relationship with our European neighbours.</p> </blockquote> <p>Plaid Cymru\u2019s Brexit spokesperson, <strong>Jonathan Edwards</strong>, welcomed the ruling.

The Government accepts that neither the European Union Referendum Act 2015 nor any other Act of Parliament confers on it statutory authority (as distinct from the Crown\u2019s prerogative power) to give notice under Article 50 [67-72, 76 and 105-108].</p> <h2> <em>Background</em></h2> <p>3 - On 1 January 1973 the United Kingdom joined what were then the European Communities, including the European Economic Community. Parliament passed the European Communities Act 1972 (1972 Act) to allow that to happen since it was a condition of membership that Community law should be given effect in the domestic law of the United Kingdom and primary legislation was required to achieve this [1 and 36-54]. The European Communities have now become the European Union.</p> <p>4 - Pursuant to the European Union Referendum Act 2015 a referendum was held on 23 June 2016 on the question whether the United Kingdom should leave or remain in the European Union. The answer given was that the UK should leave [2].</p> <p>5- The process for withdrawal is governed by Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union, which states that once a Member State gives notice to withdraw there is a two-year period in which to negotiate a withdrawal agreement. If no agreement is reached in this time then, subject only to agreement on an extension of time with the European Council acting unanimously, the EU Treaties shall cease to apply to that State. The Government accepts that a notice under Article 50 cannot be withdrawn once it has been given. It also accepts that Article 50 does not allow a conditional notice to be given: a notice cannot be qualified by stating that Parliament is required to approve any withdrawal agreement made in the course of Article 50 negotiations [9-17].</p> <p>6 - Therefore, once notice is given under Article 50, some rights under EU law as incorporated into domestic law by the 1972 Act would inevitably be lost once the Article 50 withdrawal process is completed [57-66].</p> <h2> <em>The constitutional principles</em></h2> <p>7 - The most fundamental rule of the UK\u2019s constitution is that Parliament is sovereign and can make and unmake any law it chooses. As an aspect of the sovereignty of Parliament it has been established for hundreds of years that the Crown \u2013 i.e. the Government of the day \u2013 cannot by exercise of prerogative powers override legislation enacted by Parliament. This principle is of critical importance and sets the context for the general rule on which the Government seeks to rely \u2013 that normally the conduct of international relations and the making and unmaking of treaties are taken to be matters falling within the scope of the Crown\u2019s prerogative powers. That general rule exists precisely because the exercise of such prerogative powers has no effect on domestic law, including as laid down by Parliament in legislation [18-36].</p> <p>8 - In the present case, however, the Government accepts, and indeed positively contends, that if notice is given under Article 50 it will inevitably have the effect of changing domestic law. Those elements of EU law which Parliament has made part of domestic law by enactment of the 1972 Act will in due course cease to have effect [76-80].</p> <p>9 - The central contention of the Government in the present case is that Parliament must be taken to have intended when it enacted the 1972 Act that the Crown would retain its prerogative power to effect a withdrawal from the Community Treaties (now the EU Treaties), and thereby intended that the Crown should have the power to choose whether EU law should continue to have effect in the domestic law of the UK or not [76-81].</p> <h2> <em>Conclusion</em></h2> <p>10 - The Court does not accept the argument put forward by the Government. There is nothing in the text of the 1972 Act to support it. In the judgment of the Court the argument is contrary both to the language used by Parliament in the 1972 Act and to the fundamental constitutional principles of the sovereignty of Parliament and the absence of any entitlement on the part of the Crown to change domestic law by the exercise of its prerogative powers [82-94, 97-104]. The Court expressly accepts the principal argument of the claimants [95-96].</p> <p>11 - For the reasons set out in the judgment, we decide that the Government does not have power under the Crown\u2019s prerogative to give notice pursuant to Article 50 for the UK to withdraw from the European Union.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-11-03T11:57:31.937Z\">at 11.57am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-581b1394e4b029b92ca45104\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-03T10:39:22.137Z\">10.39am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Downing Street has also said the government will appeal.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/jessicaelgot/status/794126273786298368\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Government says it is &quot;disappointed&quot; by court ruling on Article 50 and will appeal, expecting Supreme Court hearing on December 7</p>&mdash; Jessica Elgot (@jessicaelgot) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jessicaelgot/status/794126273786298368\">November 3, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-581b119ae4b029b92ca450fd\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-03T10:35:20.074Z\">10.35am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here is <a href=\"https://www.judiciary.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/summary-r-miller-v-secretary-of-state-for-exiting-the-eu-20161103.pdf\">the summary of the judgment (pdf).</a></p> <p>And here is its conclusion.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"939710052c8514fb2fd2fb6bf01fbdf181d28160\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/939710052c8514fb2fd2fb6bf01fbdf181d28160/0_0_716_293/500.jpg\" alt=\"Conclusion of summary of article 50 judgement\" width=\"500\" height=\"205\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Conclusion of summary of article 50 judgement</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Court service</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-581b11eae4b07ceadb3a1f99\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-03T10:33:24.611Z\">10.33am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">International trade secretary Liam Fox says government will appeal to supreme court</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>In the Commons<strong> Barry Gardiner</strong>, the shadow international trade secretary, asks <strong>Liam Fox</strong>, the international trade secretary, says the government should accept that the Commons will vote for article 50 to be triggered.

But there is increasing speculation in legal circles that the prime minister would not take the risk of being defeated a second time in the Supreme Court.</p> <p>That court would probably not deliver its ruling before January, leaving Theresa May with relatively little time to get legislation passed before her self-imposed deadline of 31 March.</p> <p>If she accepts the court\u2019s decision, she could introduce legislation next week.</p> <p>It\u2019s thought that a bill would be approved by MPs with little difficulty but might run into difficulties when it reaches the House of Lords. Critics of Brexit hope that delays in the Lords would encourage the government to think again.</p> <p>The more time there is for the bill to go through parliament, the less effective any delaying tactics would be.</p> <p>Just as Boris Johnson\u2019s policy on cake was \u201cpro having it and pro eating it\u201d, the prime minister might introduce legislation as well as pressing on with an appeal.

This is the film he doesn\u2019t want you to see. And here\u2019s why we think you should see it \u2026</p> <p>Ten years ago, when several residents whose homes are located on the picturesque sand dunes of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/23/donald-trump-faces-wall-of-opposition-as-he-returns-to-scotland\">Balmedie in Scotland</a> refused to sell their land to Trump for his new luxury golf course resort, the billionaire began a campaign of bullying and intimidation that continues to this day. Most well-known among these residents is farmer Michael Forbes, whose modest croft sits right in the middle of where Trump wanted to build \u201cthe greatest golf course in the world\u201d. Michael\u2019s mother Molly (now aged 92) lives in a caravan across the farmyard from her son. The home has a handmade carved sign on it, reading \u201cParadise\u201d. That was, until Trump arrived.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In 2010 I interviewed Michael Forbes on his fishing boat, and he mentioned in passing that they had no running water</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Trump\u2019s first attempt at being a great neighbour was to go on national television and slam the state of Michael Forbes\u2019s farm. The farm was \u201ca slum\u201d, and Michael \u201clived like a pig\u201d, fumed Trump. How could he possibly build his hotel for millionaires if the windows were to look out over \u201cthis horrible, horrible slum\u201d?</p> <p>The hotel was part of Trump\u2019s master plan for the Menie estate\u2019s shifting sand dunes that would create \u201c6,000 jobs\u201d, see the building of 1,500 houses and the construction of a skyscraper hotel. Trump promised to get \u201cAberdeen booming\u201d. His claims were lapped up by local politicians, eager to find an economic wand to wave for when North Sea oil runs dry. No problem if the residents refused to sell. Next up was his threat of eminent domain \u2013 or under UK law, compulsory purchase.</p> <p>So concerned was I at the lack of scrutiny of Trump\u2019s plan and the devastating effect it would have on people and the rare sand dunes where he wanted to build his gated golf resort that I began making my film, You\u2019ve Been Trumped.</p> <p>In the summer of 2010 I interviewed Michael Forbes on his salmon-fishing boat, and he mentioned in passing that they had no running water. Trump\u2019s workers had apparently cut through a pipe leading from the spring that serves the Forbes\u2019s well. The result was that Michael, his wife Sheila and Michael\u2019s mother, Molly, were without running water. This had been going on for a week. And what had Trump done about it? Nothing, according to the Forbes.</p> <p>I went immediately to speak to the man in charge of Trump\u2019s building work at the time to get the other side of the story. He confirmed that there was nobody trying to sort the problem out. He explained they had to \u201cassess it first\u201d so that it \u201cwould be a jewel of a system and sustain itself. It\u2019ll be the best water system he\u2019s ever had\u201d.</p> <p>A short time later I was arrested along with my producer Richard Phinney, and we were thrown into an Aberdeen police cell. There we sat for hours while the police \u2013 apparently acting as a private security force for Trump \u2013 dreamed up some ludicrous charge. The charges were eventually dropped, and the police issued an apology.

  "<p>There was a baseball game last night.</p> <p>There are three stories to tell about it, and they\u2019re stacked on top of each other, tottering, each bigger than the last and relying on the one below it to make sense. The first story: the Cubs took a 6-3 lead into the eighth inning of Game 7 of the World Series, and Aroldis Chapman blew it. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2016/nov/03/chicago-cubs-title-drought-american-sporting-folklore-world-series\">Then he won the game</a>.</p> <p>The protagonists of baseball stories are often pitchers; they\u2019re the ones who fundamentally act to begin play. Even the hitter standing at the plate merely gets the privilege of reacting first. But protagonism is not inherently heroic, and Chapman\u2019s was tainted appropriately; most everyone in the audience was rooting against him to some degree. Some wanted him to blow the lead. Others wanted him to do poorly enough that another Cubs pitcher would be brought in to take the save. Still others wanted Chapman to triumph completely, then walk off the mound and out of a Cubs uniform forever. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2016/nov/03/chicago-cubs-title-drought-american-sporting-folklore-world-series\">Chicago Cubs end most storied title drought in American sporting folklore | Bryan Armen Graham</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Some small portion of everyone\u2019s wishes came true. Chapman allowed three runs in the eighth to Brandon Guyer, Rajai Davis, and Coco Crisp to tie the game. Then he had to spend a half-inning in the dugout with his team-mates. He returned to the mound in the ninth having blown the biggest save of his career with the eyes of history on him, failed the people in the sport closest to him, and knowing he cannot satisfy that failure \u2013 tonight he will not be batting. All that is left for Chapman to do, then, is his best. His best was merely sufficient. Aroldis Chapman retired the side in order in the ninth and departed the game.</p> <p>He was only able to watch as Ben Zobrist, Anthony Rizzo, and pitchers Carl Edwards Jr and Mike Montgomery, secured the Cubs win in the tenth inning ... for him. Such are the oddities of baseball scoring that Chapman will go down in the record books as the winning pitcher in the game Chicago broke the curse. And he will always know what that means, because all of us know will always know what that means: in the most important game of his career, his best was only good enough to blow a save instead of lose outright \u2013 and after that, it was in the hands of the people around him. All he could do was trust and hope, because he was powerless.</p> <p>This might sound like it\u2019s intended as some form of either absolution or comeuppance for <a href=\"http://sports.yahoo.com/news/aroldis-chapman-s-girlfriend-alleged-he--choked--her--according-to-police-report-023629095.html\">the domestic violence incident involving Chapman</a> last December. It\u2019s not and it never could be, but there\u2019s a reason it sounds that way: a man with extraordinary abilities being humbled by hubris in a moment of triumph is a very, very old story. In the fictional version, the hubris would be the some moral imperfection on the pitcher\u2019s part, and his fall would be delivered not by a bolt of lightning from the gods but through the pitcher\u2019s manager, who over-relied on him and sapped his tremendous gifts when they were needed most. That fall is intensely personal \u2013 his team-mates go on to win the game and their place in history \u2013 and he is left with the symbolic scar of his \u201cwin\u201d in the history books. This is a story of justice and punishment, and it feels right because everyone more or less got what the story thought they deserved in the end. And in that specific sense, the story of Chapman resolved in the best way possible.</p> <p>Yet resolution has no moral quality. There is no true punishment to be found for Chapman, the man, in throwing a baseball poorly; likewise, there would have been no absolution to be found for him in throwing a baseball well. But the story itself? The story is perfect. The final half-hour of last night\u2019s baseball game was one of the best contained dramas that American sports have ever told.</p> <p>Then, above that first story, there is the second story: after defeating the Giants and the Dodgers handily in the first two rounds of the postseason \u2013 never facing elimination against either, and only trailing once \u2013 the Cubs went to the brink of elimination against the Cleveland Indians and came back from a 3-1 World Series deficit to win the championship. One might prefer to add \u201cat home\u201d to the end of that sentence (blame the Commissioner Emeritus for that one), but otherwise this is the greatest way to win a World Series. Unlike the 3-0 comeback, where first one team wins all the games and then the other does, throwing in an early win in Game 2 keeps the front of the series engaging, rather than feeling like a let down that\u2019s only redeemed when the real danger of elimination looms. Just as Chapman\u2019s story is completely different if the Cubs aren\u2019t right to trust his talent so completely, the Cubs\u2019 story this postseason is completely different if they\u2019re not actually the best team in baseball. Chapman gives up runs, but he still touches triple digits on the fastball. The Cubs lose games, but they still look not just like they belong, but like they can win.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fc85688516a6792e67e68ba6af714b0a711063e9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fc85688516a6792e67e68ba6af714b0a711063e9/0_131_4722_2833/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ben Zobrist celebrates after helping the Cubs to victory\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ben Zobrist celebrates after helping the Cubs to victory.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matt Slocum/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>That\u2019s because these Cubs can win, of course; they can win an almost arbitrary number of times. The Chicago Cubs won three games in a row 22 times this year. The most times a team could possibly win three games in a row in a standard MLB season \u2013 speaking mathematically, not practically \u2013 is 54. What does that mean though, really? Well, it means they won more games than the Minnesota Twins won all year just in virtual sweeps.</p> <p>The regular season doesn\u2019t predict the playoffs, but it does contextualize them, and the context of reporters marveling about how loose the Chicago clubhouse was after Game 4 was this: the Cubs had spent around half of the year winning three games in a row over and over and over again, and nobody\u2019s definition of impossible includes something they\u2019ve done 20 times since they last paid their taxes. (Two of those three-game win streaks came before 15 April.)</p> <p>At the same time, winning three games in a row <em>on command</em> remains the daunting statistical task it\u2019s always been \u2013 and that gives us our real conflict, because the Cubs\u2019 opponent in the second story isn\u2019t the Indians or the Dodgers or the Giants, but sequence and consequence, force and pressure: can they do something they\u2019ve done all year long right now, on demand, in order to save their season?</p> <p>The answer was comprehensive. Their first win was tense, their second win was convincing, and their third was one of the best games of the era, if not <em>the</em> best. It is particularly fitting that while the winning blows were struck by the veterans Ben Zobrist and Miguel Montero, while the actual scoring runners were Albert Almora and Anthony Rizzo \u2013 Zobrist and Montero\u2019s entire careers were redefined by those two moments last night. They will never do anything in the game of baseball more important than that. They never <em>could</em> do anything in the game of baseball more important than that. It\u2019s a moment for men near the end of their careers, not at the beginning.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/nov/03/bill-murray-chicago-cubs-obama-white-house\">Bill Murray basks in 'beautiful' victory as Obama invites Cubs to White House</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And also fitting is that Kris Bryant, who will likely win the National League Most Valuable Player Award, momentarily faded into the background in that final sequence to let two veteran free agent signings, the promising first-round pick who hasn\u2019t yet made his mark (running for the promising first-round pick who just returned from destroying his knee), and the prodigal son from the Chicago front office\u2019s previous relationship combine for the winning runs over multiple plays. The second story, after all, is an epic, not a morality tale, and epics concern the virtues and failings of many people.</p> <p>These Chicago Cubs could not have been anyone, but they could have been many people, and they were. They are special, but they are not unique. Their roster was made the same way as rosters have been made before it and will be made after it; theirs was better than some that have won the World Series, and it was worse than others. Theo Epstein is no god, Jed Hoyer is not his son and between them they have no prophets. No star or sign or sigil brought the Cubs to this World Series. And to accept that now, at the ending, is to also accept that there was no star or sign or sigil that kept the Cubs away. </p> <p>The third and final story sits above the second story and the first, and it is the story of a curse. It has <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_the_Billy_Goat\">nothing to do with goats</a>. It has nothing to do with the Wrigley family, an angry tavern owner, or the World Series. It has nothing to do with the Chicago Cubs. It has nothing to do with baseball. It certainly has nothing to do with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Bartman_incident\">Steve Bartman</a>.</p> <p>This World Series, this one in particular, is so meaningful and so important is because at some point, the fact that the Cubs had not won a World Series in many years became a terrifyingly powerful thing. It became the birthmark of entire generations of Midwestern sports fans; its predictive force went from theoretical to that of a cultural law of gravity. Putting a Cubs hat on a fictional character or a Cubs mug in his hand <em>meant something</em>, and not that the character was from Chicago. A fictional Cubs team wins the World Series in the 1993 film <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0107985/\">Rookie of the Year</a>, but almost no one remembers that because the movie cuts straight from the last day of the season to the first day of spring \u2013 still living in the immense shadow of the real story of the Cubs, even in another world.</p> <p>And all it required was the passing of generations and the workings of the real world. The generations of Cubs fans that were born and then died between 1908 and last night don\u2019t resonate the way that they do because they didn\u2019t get to see some sports championship. They resonate because time is running out on our dreams, too.</p> <p>Last night that third story, that century-old monster that gathered so much weight over the years that it was a wonder it didn\u2019t crack the surface of the Earth and drag Wrigleyville with it right down into hell, ended. It ended perfectly and forever. Never again will the story of the Chicago Cubs and their 108-year long World Championship drought again hold such court in the vastness of the American cultural mind.</p> <p>The curse this story concerns is this: it\u2019s morning now, Cubs fans, and nothing for all the rest of your days will be like last night. Some things will be better. Some will last longer. Some may honestly make you happier \u2013 far happier. But last night you touched a storybook as it closed perfectly, and felt something older and bigger than yourselves conclude in perhaps the rarest of things man has been responsible for in our long and sordid history: an authentic, earned happy ending.</p> <p>Touching that mystery once is enough, I imagine, and those who missed their chance last night have long odds to live to see another. And it\u2019ll feel good to be the top dog in the Central for a change. It\u2019s surprising how easy that transition is, as the new story starts. The Cubs win the World Series. The year is almost over. The Cleveland Indians will go into next season without having won a World Series since 1948. Time is always running out.</p>",
  "<p>There\u2019s a case to be made that the theories about Westworld are more interesting than the actual show. As you will likely already know, the new HBO drama is about a near-future theme park where robots simulate characters from the wild west and human guests pay to beat the bots, shag the bots and slit their throats. The guests aren\u2019t troubled by inflicting such horrors on their victims because hey, they\u2019re just robots. But then those very same robots start forming memories and, let me tell you, they\u2019re not remembering the good stuff.</p> <p> This week <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/oct/31/westworld-hbo-villains-ai-robots\">Sasha Frere Jones</a> has written persuasively on the limits of such a dramatic conceit. It\u2019s difficult to identify with robots, for example. And if those robots were to develop \u201cconsciousness\u201d, could we really empathise with human characters so wantonly slicing them up? Generally speaking, these two qualities \u2013 characters you can identify with, a sense of who the \u2018good guys\u2019 are \u2013 are fundamental to a successful drama. But what if they weren\u2019t?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/oct/31/westworld-hbo-villains-ai-robots\">The Good, the Meh and the Ugly: are Westworld's villains firing blanks?</a> </p> </aside>  <p> An alternate way of looking at the series can be found by visiting the <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/westworld/\">Westworld subreddit</a>. Going there makes me feel like William from the TV show \u2013 a naif both repulsed and intimidated by what he finds in the park. In r/westworld I found a community who loved every minute of Westworld, and on terms almost entirely different to my own. Among the many many posts were user-made maps, annotated clips of footage, status updates on every character. There were also theories. Lots and lots of theories.</p> <p> The theories that fans have come up with are becoming more of a talking point than the show itself. Is William actually Ed Harris\u2019s Man in Black, but on an alternative timeline? Is the park\u2019s apparently human employee Bernard actually a robot? Is Anthony Hopkins\u2019 park owner, Robert Ford, also a robot or, if not, actually his long-deceased business partner Arnold?

Theorising about the outcome of a series has been common at least since Lost lost its way (a drama, like Westworld, created by JJ Abrams\u2019 production company Bad Robot). But watching the way redditors have shaped discussion and may in fact have made it more interesting than it would have been otherwise, I came up with my own theory. In not too distant a future, there\u2019ll be TV series that ask the fans to tell the story.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/oct/31/westworld-recap-episode-five-hold-on-to-your-hats-its-dolores-the-lawless\">Westworld recap: episode five \u2013 hold on to your hats! It's Dolores the lawless</a> </p> </aside>  <p> Just to be clear, I don\u2019t think Westworld is such a show. I think there are some hints being dropped, some red herrings left and some non-sequiturs thrown in for added bamboozlement. I also think there are holes in the heart of this drama which viewers are rushing to fill. But it doesn\u2019t take much of a flight of fancy to imagine a show similar to Westworld where intention was removed from the creator and handed to its audience.</p> <p> As well as a lot of theorising, there\u2019s been a fair bit of thinkpiecing around Westworld, a cottage industry I am proud to join here. One such piece on the AV Club this week mused on the ways the Man in Black is like a video game player. The park in Westworld is itself like a game, the author <a href=\"http://www.avclub.com/article/westworlds-man-black-isnt-villainhes-video-game-ne-244745\">Matt Gerardi</a> said, where guests can put themselves at the heart of an adventure without incurring any real-life consequences. In this game, the Man in Black is a type of player known as a \u201cspeedrunner\u201d (someone who knows the game inside out and whose only remaining pleasure is to take the whole thing apart).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"319cd0ef1212ea9f9dd53ef972c11ec6e09aafa6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/319cd0ef1212ea9f9dd53ef972c11ec6e09aafa6/0_77_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"There are holes in the heart of this drama which viewers are rushing to fill \u2026 Anthony Hopkins as Dr Robert Ford in Westworld.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">There are holes in the heart of this drama which viewers are rushing to fill \u2026 Anthony Hopkins as Dr Robert Ford in Westworld.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: HBO</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p> Speedrunners are often derided in gaming culture, but Gerardi says that\u2019s unfair. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with looking for meaning in a creation you love,\u201d he writes. \u201cWhether it\u2019s Westworld, the show; Westworld, the cheesy 1973 movie; or Westworld, the living video game. To imply that dismantling a game and yearning for a deeper meaning in it are acts of disrespect is to discount what games are, what games can be, and how much they mean to the people who love them. What\u2019s more human than the pursuit of truth, meaning and the unseeable forces that make a world work? These are the things that make the game worth playing, again and again and again.\u201d</p> <p>In this description of a character in Westworld, I think Gerardi has done a good job of describing its fandom. Through their unofficial memorabilia and complex theorising, fans of Westworld are trying to find meaning. That the meaning may well not be there is to some extent not the point. It\u2019s about the pursuit, the looking. Fans get their enjoyment as much from the formulation of theory as its validation. After all, most theories turn out to be rubbish. But if it doesn\u2019t prove right, just come up with another one, again and again and again.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"44b30f11f4d13069eb27a9ab569dd468bd6f7246\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/44b30f11f4d13069eb27a9ab569dd468bd6f7246/0_0_5760_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Going to the Westworld subreddit makes me feel like William from the show \u2013 a naif both repulsed and intimidated by what he finds.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Going to the Westworld subreddit makes me feel like William from the show \u2013 a naif both repulsed and intimidated by what he finds.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: HBO</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p> You might be able to tell that this brave new mode is not my preferred way of engaging with drama. I enjoy them not so much for what they hide as what they show. My favourite serial of late has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/mr-robot\">Mr Robot</a>, the almost virtuoso creation of producer (and director and writer) Sam Esmail, who cedes control to no one. Mr Robot has its tricks (you often share the same delusions as unreliable narrator Elliott) but it\u2019s compelling because of the way it explores a number of 21st-century themes; from alienation and self-doubt to privacy and gender. When Elliot meets his schoolfriend and nemesis Angela in a subway train, you see how their characters have led them to where they are and define how they will progress in future. While I can infer my own meanings from what is said, there are limits and they are narrow. There is some form of messaging from creator to viewer.</p> <p> But what I\u2019m realising is that this doesn\u2019t have to be the case. There are a lot of people out there who like to shape the narrative themselves, to choose their own adventure. They want to find their own meaning in a TV show. And TV could give them what they want. Not just in vague, focus-grouped ways, either, but by drafting a story vague and dextrous enough to react to the latest theorising. A story that was there to build theories up, knock them down, then turn everything on its head at a moment\u2019s notice and force the theorists to start again. This isn\u2019t drama as I understand it, indeed it is more of a game. It\u2019s also a game that runs a real risk of serving up an unsatisfactory ending. But if the pleasure is in the journey not the destination, would that really matter?</p>",

Then we get some yahoo who thinks going on a \u2018recent holiday to Peru\u2019 is entirely normal behaviour and worth unashamedly sharing with us. The game\u2019s gone. It\u2019s well and truly gone\u201d \u2013 John Mackay.</p> <p>\u201cIsn\u2019t there an obvious solution to the poppy fiasco for the FA? It should commission a custom strip with <a href=\"http://www.ppu.org.uk/whitepoppy/index.html\">white poppies</a> embroidered into the material of the shirt. If anyone were to notice it against the similar coloured background, no one could object to a symbol even less partizan than the supposedly divisive red version, warmongers and despots excepted. But even if Fifa did align itself with that group, the FA could avoid sanction by denying all knowledge and blaming the kit designers.

  "<p>Three senior judges ruled on Thursday that the British government does not have the authority to proceed with the UK\u2019s exit from the European Union without the approval of parliament. A legal challenge to the prime minister\u2019s power to trigger article 50, the clause that formally begins Brexit, has proved controversial since being launched in the aftermath of the EU referendum vote earlier this year.</p> <p>The government said the decision to leave the EU was taken by the public in the referendum on 23 June and that its executive powers, under the royal prerogative, were sufficient to give notice to the EU on behalf of the cabinet. But this was challenged by the claimants who said that the referendum was merely consultative and only parliament had the power to decide.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/nov/03/-three-judges-mps-vote-brexit-article-50-high-court\">Who are the judges who ruled that MPs should vote on Brexit?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>One of two main claimants who led the challenge, Gina Miller, a businesswoman and philanthropist, said at the outset that the case was not an attempt to overturn the referendum decision. Miller said the intention was to \u201canswer a fundamental legal question about the powers that can be used by the prime minister and whether they can side-step parliament\u201d.</p> <h2><strong>Can the ruling stop Brexit?</strong></h2> <p>Almost certainly not. But it does make the position much more confused. MPs are talking of the high court triggering a constitutional crisis without any indication of how to get out of it. </p> <p>It also risks driving an even bigger wedge between leavers and remainers, particularly since the leavers are likely to interpret this as one more desperate attempt by the Metropolitan liberal elite to thwart the will of the people (a suspicion that is going to shape the thinking of a lot of MPs).</p> <p>The government has said it will appeal against the decision and it has permission to go straight to the supreme court, which has set aside time for what might be a four-day hearing starting on 7 December . All 11 of the justices in position will sit \u2013 the biggest court ever assembled \u2013 to decide on a matter that goes to the heart of the UK\u2019s unwritten constitution.</p> <p>The supreme court will be extremely sensitive to public opinion about the role of the court, and whether it is making decisions that are more political than judicial. However both sides, government as well as the petitioners, accept that it is a proper matter for the courts to decide, whatever the Brexiteers are shouting about declaring war on democracy. </p> <h2><strong>Will the government appeal?</strong></h2> <p>Although both Downing Street and Liam Fox, the international trade secretary, have said it will, there are plenty of voices counselling against. The high court\u2019s ruling was comprehensively in favour of parliament and against invoking Article 50 using prerogative powers. Appealing will just add to the delay. But there are politics at play here that may yet make no 10 feel they must fight all the way.</p> <h2>How will parliament be consulted?</h2> <p>The biggest question of all. Is a straight yes or no vote \u2013 a kind of parliamentary referendum \u2013 enough? Technically, that is possible. The risk \u2013 some say the likelihood \u2013 is that if government tried to bounce parliament into that kind of snap judgement, it would be vulnerable to another legal action. </p> <p>Some sources are already indicating it will be legislation, as the judges appear to suggest is necessary. The people who brought the case argued that it would be constitutionally impossible to change the law of Britain (as of course leaving the EU would, massively) without an act of parliament.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/nov/03/parliament-must-trigger-brexit-high-court-rules\">Setback for Theresa May as high court says MPs must approve Brexit</a> </p> </aside>  <p>If there has to be a whole new bill that goes to the Commons and Lords stage by stage, it will be a long and (for the government) dangerous fight. If it\u2019s just yes or no, the vote could happen quickly - and probably within Theresa May\u2019s previously stated timetable of triggering article 50 by the end of March.</p> <h2>How would MPs vote on article 50?</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video element--supporting\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/nov/03/victorious-gina-miller-reacts-to-article-50-ruling-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/5ajhf\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2868360\"            data-video-name=\"Victorious Gina Miller reacts to article 50 ruling: 'this case was about process, not politics' \u2013\u00a0video\"            data-video-provider=\"AP\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-581b16e4e4b07ceadb3a1fb4\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/11/03/161103Winnerclean_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/11/03/161103Winnerclean.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/11/03/161103Winnerclean_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/nov/03/victorious-gina-miller-reacts-to-article-50-ruling-video\">Victorious Gina Miller reacts to article 50 ruling: \u2018this case was about process, not politics\u2019 \u2013 video</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>That\u2019s not clear. Most MPs supported remain, but most represent constituencies that voted leave. This will go right to the heart of how the British constitution works: whether MPs should vote according to the wishes of their constituents or in their best judgement (leaving the electorate to decide whether to keep them in a job at the next election).</p> <p>Having said that, leave was the majority view in nearly 70% of Labour seats for example, so it would probably be electoral suicide for the party\u2019s MPs to rebel (or perhaps even abstain). Such a move could open the gates to Ukip.</p> <h2>Does it make an early general election more likely?</h2> <p>Yes, it must. That is one thing that MPs could possibly do to sort out the conflict between what they think is in the national interest and what their voters want. Although it is hard to think of a single Labour MP who would fancy the idea right now - and it would take a two-thirds majority in the Commons to trigger an early election under the Fixed Term Parliaments Act. </p>",
  "<p>Remember when the Glazer brothers took control of Manchester United back in 2005? They borrowed \u00a3660m to acquire the club, then saddled it with the debt they used to finance the acquisition. In other words, the club paid for its own purchase. At the time, it sounded to many like some dubious newfangled financial mechanism. Dubious it was. But not new. The church was at it long before football was invented.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/biography/Albert-German-cardinal-margrave-of-Brandenburg-and-elector-of-Mainz\" title=\"\">Albert of Brandenburg</a> borrowed tens of thousands of ducats from the banker <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jakob_Fugger\" title=\"\">Jacob Fugger</a> to buy various ecclesiastical titles and bishoprics from the pope, and then raised the money to repay the loan by selling bits of paper that promised the buyer time off purgatory. Like others before him, he turned the church\u2019s promise of salvation into a way of making money, much of which was being funnelled to Rome to rebuild St Peter\u2019s Basilica. It was a ploy that would make <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/02/philip-green-may-be-forced-to-pay-money-into-bhs-pension-scheme\" title=\"\">Philip Green</a> blush, but established practice in the Roman church of the early 16th century. Batteries of nuns would be paid to pray for the soul of some wealthy dead aristocrat. Gifts to the church were encouraged as useful collateral in the hereafter. The whole business model of the Roman church was premised on selling salvation as if it were soap powder, often in order to finance extravagant building projects.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/luther_martin.shtml\" title=\"\">Martin Luther</a> was an unknown monk in an ecclesiastical backwater before he wrote Albert a letter of protest. People in the pews were being ripped off. And worse still, the church was twisting authentic Christian theology for financial gain. Salvation wasn\u2019t for the church to buy and sell. First, it was free. And second, it was entirely the gift of God. The letter was sent on 31 October 1517, and, as legend has it, nailed to the door of All Saints, Wittenberg. So this week we have entered the 500th year since the Reformation, the greatest and most far-reaching social protest movement of them all. With Luther\u2019s terse 95&#xa0;point letter, Protestantism was born.</p> <p>Had Albert ignored Luther\u2019s 95 theses probably nothing much would have happened. But he pushed back, escalating the conflict to head office in Rome and pressuring Luther\u2019s monastic order to silence his preaching. They wanted him squashed, but protest feeds off opposition. And Luther had the astonishing courage of the true believer, indifferent to the danger he was in, and far ahead of his time in appreciating the power of technology to encourage popular resistance.</p> <p>The printing press was his social media and he used it to devastating effect, continually taking the piss out of the papacy, unafraid to use vulgarity as a means of making serious points. And within a few years, widespread revolution broke out against the totalitarian theology of the Roman death star. The church would fracture, never again to claim such temporal power. And hallelujah&#xa0;for&#xa0;that. Luther\u2019s protest was the mother of all protest movements. And easily the most successful.</p> <p>Earlier this week, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/31/catholics-lutherans-joint-declaration-pope-francis-christian-sweden\" title=\"\">Pope Francis met leaders of the Lutheran church to \u201cmend\u201d history</a>, \u201crecognising error and seeking forgiveness.\u201d Despite the reactionary instincts brought back by the counter-Reformation \u2013 the empire strikes back \u2013 the Catholic church has accepted much of Luther\u2019s teaching. His theology was just an intensification of that of Saint Augustine, after all. And the current pope has something of the reformer about him. Within months of his enthronement he was castigating another German bishop for his lavish spending on church property, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/24/world/europe/vatican-suspends-german-bishop-known-for-spending.html\" title=\"\">including a $20,000 bathtub</a>.</p> <p>But it\u2019s not just about the money. It\u2019s more about the control and centralisation of access to God. What Protestants made clear was that there are no human gatekeepers to the divine. You don\u2019t have to go via the church. There are no penny-in-the-slot turnstiles to the almighty. Just get down on your knees and hope for the best. This simple insight changed the world. Some see it as responsible for secularisation and western individualism. Others as the call for a&#xa0;permanent and continual revolution against the forces of oppression. And&#xa0;a reminder that no human being \u2013 whatever their religion \u2013 should claim an authority that is properly left to God, and God alone.</p>",
  "<p>If you need a distraction ahead of Tuesday\u2019s potentially cataclysmic US election, imagine a world in which all Britons and Americans knew about each other came from popular TV drama imports.</p> <p>US viewers would envisage a place in the iron grip of a monarch with presidential powers over law and war (Victoria and, from tomorrow, The Crown), who rules with the help of the aristocracy (Downton Abbey) and cerebral super-detectives (Sherlock). </p> <p>Brits would imagine over there to be overrun with doctors (ER, House), cops (NYPD Blue), lawyers (The Good Wife, LA Law) and flatmates (Friends) who have a standup\u2019s knack for one-liners. Such savvy chat even comes from the chemistry teachers turned drug barons (Breaking Bad) and the pathologists (Dexter) who are secret serial killers.</p> <p>The TV overview of Britain that Americans are given is nostalgically positive, while the image of Americans transmitted in the UK perhaps exaggerates the sense of humour of the average citizen.</p> <p>But in documentaries made about the other country, a very different picture emerges. American factual TV largely ignores Britain (and most other countries), except for reports on Princess Diana and her sons or profiles of showbiz hit-Brits such as Adele. </p> <p>Failing to return the compliment, British docs about the US tend to represent America as what the novelist Saul Bellow called in 1990 (adopting a phrase from Wyndham Lewis) \u201cthe moronic inferno\u201d. Such films \u2013 representing an attitude that ranges from \u201cOnly in America!\u201d to, at its most extreme, \u201cEven in America!\u201d \u2013 show a nation of morbidly obese racist evangelical Christians, waving a weapon in one hand and voting for Ronald Reagan or George W Bush \u2013 or now Donald Trump \u2013 with the other.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"6fcdbd3b01b1aa5096852fd3b2f6ee1fe08de1a1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6fcdbd3b01b1aa5096852fd3b2f6ee1fe08de1a1/120_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Eye-popping \u2026 Jadin, aged 9 fires a gun in a firing range as his mum Courtney films him.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Eye-popping \u2026 Jadin, aged nine, fires a gun in a firing range as his mum Courtney films him.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rogan Product/Channel 4</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On the eve of what will bring either the Trump presidency, or four years of resentment from his thwarted fans, comes another trio of examples of this. Two of them compete in the 9pm slot tonight \u2013 The Conspiracy Files: The Trump Dossier (BBC2) and The Gun Shop (Channel 4) \u2013 while the third-party candidate is American High School (iPlayer).</p> <p>Although one aim of documentary is to explain a foreign culture to outsiders, The Gun Shop presents an aspect of America that, however good the film, will remain inexplicable to most outsiders. Shot at Freedom Firearms, a weapon-and-ammunition store in Battle Creek, Michigan, it works for a Channel 4 audience as weirdo TV. In the most eye-popping scene, a mother films proudly as her nine-year-old son has his first gun lesson at the shop\u2019s firing range.</p> <p>But far more than most offerings on the topic, this film sometimes twists its pointing finger to scratch its chin. Customers\u2019 backstories show them to be not merely gung-ho, but traumatised. The mum of the son with the gun was the victim of an armed car jacking, while other first-time gun buyers are shown to have been motivated by a random mass shooting nearby or the killing of an African-American driver by police. </p> <p>That man was shot after telling police he had a gun, so tooling up could be seen as a poor insurer of personal safety.

I had to check twice that it really is him behind the cigar and that perfect cut-glass accent.</p> <p>Above all, it\u2019s an opportunity to gawp at Foy\u2019s unendingly expressive eyes as the weight of the entire world comes to rest on her slight, pale shoulders. As the young Princess Elizabeth she steals the show, and that takes some doing when you\u2019re playing opposite Smith as a flop-haired Prince Philip. \u201cNice hat,\u201d he grins at a Nairobi tribesman sporting an enormous headdress, showing early signs of the booby we know and love today.

Clinton has emphasized her commitment to such issues since launching her campaign, and also focused on raising the minimum wage, an issue inextricably tied to gender in that women make up two-thirds of minimum wage earners.</p> <p>Jess O\u2019Connell, the executive director of Emily\u2019s List, said Trump was simply vocalizing in politically incorrect terms what Republicans have long advocated in more veiled language.</p> <p>\u201cSingle women are afraid the Republicans are going to turn back the clocks on them,\u201d O\u2019Connell said. \u201cIgnoring the gender gap in wages or wanting to punish women for having an abortion shows a real lack of understanding about women and their lives today.</p> <p>\u201cThis is when women\u2019s voices are going to be heard.\u201d</p> <p><br></p>",
  "<p>A professional US poker player has lost his appeal against a London casino over winnings of \u00a37.7m due to his use of \u201cedge-sorting\u201d, a gambling technique that involves exploiting design irregularities on the backs of cards.</p> <p>Phil Ivey, 39, had challenged a 2014 high court decision to dismiss his case against Genting Casinos UK, which owns Crockfords Club in Mayfair. After successfully playing a version of baccarat known as Punto Banco at the casino two years earlier, Ivey was told his winnings would be wired to him and he left for home in Las Vegas, but it never arrived. Instead, his stake money of \u00a31m was returned to him.</p> <p> Genting, which owns more than 40 casinos in the UK, said edge-sorting, which Ivey used to gain a competitive advantage, was not a legitimate strategy and the casino had no liability to him.</p> <p>The tactic allows players to predict whether a card may be high or low \u2013 and therefore beneficial to their hand \u2013 by finding tiny irregularities in the back of each card. </p> <p>The manufacturing process in some decks of cards causes tiny differences on the edges of playing cards. Some cards printed for the Genting Group have this characteristic, as the machine that cuts them leaves a pattern \u2013 a white circle broken by two curved lines \u2013 that is more pronounced on some cards than others.</p> <p>Genting claimed that Ivey\u2019s exploitation of the printing differences defeated the essential premise of the game of baccarat, thereby invalidating the gaming contract at best, or cheating at worst.</p> <p>The casino\u2019s chosen manufacturer, Angel Co Ltd, says this is not a defect and is within a contractually specified tolerance of up to 0.3mm.<br></p> <p> </p> <p> On Thursday in the court of appeal, Lady Justice Arden said it was common ground that there was an implied term in the contract not to cheat and the meaning of cheating for that purpose was to be determined in accordance with the Gambling Act 2005.</p> <p>\u201cIn my judgment, this section provides that a party may cheat within the meaning of this section without dishonesty or intention to deceive: depending on the circumstances it may be enough that he simply interferes with the process of the game,\u201d Arden said. \u201cOn that basis, the fact that the appellant did not regard himself as cheating is not determinative.\u201d</p> <p> There was no doubt, Arden added, that the actions of Ivey and another gambler, Cheung Yin Sun, interfered with the process by which Crockfords played the game. \u201cIt is for the court to determine whether the interference was of such a quality as to constitute cheating. In my judgment it had that quality.</p> <p> \u201cIn particular the actions which Mr Ivey took or caused to be taken had a substantial effect on the odds in the game and Crockfords were not aware of this at the relevant time. In these circumstances, no lower standard applied in this case because Mr Ivey was an advantage player who was in an adversarial position with the casino.\u201d</p> <p> Ivey has maintained that he did nothing more than exploit Crockfords\u2019 failure to protect themselves against a player of his ability. \u201cI was upset as I had played an honest game and won fairly. My integrity is infinitely more important to me than a big win,\u201d he said.</p> <p> Arden and Lord Justice Tomlinson dismissed the appeal but the third member of the panel, Lady Justice Sharp, allowed it, saying that the trial judge, Mr Justice Mitting, was wrong to construe the issue of \u201ccheat\u201d in the way that he did.</p> <p> Mitting had said the fact that Ivey was genuinely convinced he did not cheat and the practice commanded considerable support from others was not determinative of whether it amounted to cheating. He added that Ivey had gained himself an advantage and did so by using a croupier as his innocent agent or tool.</p> <p> In the judge\u2019s view, this was \u201ccheating for the purpose of civil law\u201d.</p> <p>After the ruling, the Genting UK president and chief operating officer, Paul Willcock, said the company was \u201cobviously very happy with the decision\u201d.</p> <p>But Ivey said the decision made no sense to him. \u201cThe trial judge said that I was not dishonest and the three appeal judges agreed, but somehow the decision has gone against me. Can someone tell me how you can have honest cheating?\u201d he said.</p> <p> The poker player\u2019s lawyer, Matthew Dowd, said: \u201cThe court of appeal\u2019s decision leaves the law totally unclear as to what constitutes cheating at gambling.</p> <p> \u201cFour judges have looked at this issue now and none of them have been able to agree on the correct interpretation of section 42 of the Gambling Act.</p> <p> \u201cIt is essential that the law is clarified and, in light of today\u2019s decision, we are seeking permission to appeal to the supreme court.\u201d</p> <p>Ivey has also been embroiled in a legal battle over edge-sorting with an Atlantic City casino. Last month, a US district judge ruled that while Ivey and Sun didn\u2019t cheat, they were liable for breach of contract when they used the technique to win $9.6m.</p>",
  "<p>Fifty-four years later, one might suppose that the famous dress came on to the stage of its own accord, as if it had life as well as destiny. But yes, in 1962, there was a warm body inside it. This was 19 May 1962, and Marilyn Monroe was bringing happy birthday wishes to the president of the United States. She was 10 days early: the actual birthday of John F Kennedy, his 45th, would not be until 29 May. So what? The Democratic party wanted to have a super fundraiser at Madison Square Garden in New York City, so they needed not just JFK himself, but a hook and bait. The birthday was a pretext until the breathy song, \u201cHappy birthday, Mr President ...\u201d</p> <p>That was Marilyn Monroe. But did the Dems ask her or did the president himself arrange it? Sometimes a president can be an instrument in his own PR. Marilyn would be 36 on 1 June, which would prove to be her last birthday. On 5 August, she was found dead in her bed in Brentwood with just a sheet around her.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqolSvoWNck\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/EqolSvoWNck?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Happy Birthday Mr President feels so directed an incident, you have to wonder who was running the show. Was it Peter Lawford, the president\u2019s brother-in-law, who seems to have been the onstage host for the event, dapper in his tux, looking off into the wings, waiting for a bright light, calling for her but she never shows, until at last he can welcome \u201cthe late Marilyn Monroe\u201d \u2013 does he hear what he\u2019s saying?</p> <p>Or was it Marilyn\u2019s own doing? There is a thought now, decades later, that says she was the victim of her time, that she was a wistful actor who wanted to play Chekhov or O\u2019Neill. But still, you have to note how, time and again, hanging on to what was called her career, she did these far-fetched things that catered to male dreams \u2013 such as playing Sugar Kane in Some Like it Hot, kissing Tony Curtis and being the dumb blond in a dirty joke for us.</p> <p>You can say that only demonstrates her victimhood and makes her wishing more wistful. But then you have to see the plain delight with which she did these preposterous things, these moments, as if she could not resist or do without the comfort that came with the gasps and the whistles at Madison Square Garden when she came into the platinum light, shrugged off her wrap and stood there, with her massed blonde waves jutting off to one side, like the control on tower an aircraft carrier, in a dress that could have been painted on her. And she did not seem like the hesitant neurotic of fame and constant lateness when she broke into the birthday song. Just take a look. She seems happy, and an actress is hired to give us some sort of good feeling. This is maybe her greatest moment \u2013 the most reckless \u2013 and she knows it, even if the summer of 1962 is her hell.</p> <p>That dress didn\u2019t just happen. It was the work of Jean Louis. Born in France in 1907, he had come to the US as a fashion designer and then got into the movies. He did work for the Duchess of Windsor, and he also created the black satin dress worn by Rita Hayworth in Gilda (1946). Hayworth does a restrained striptease (drawing off her elbow-length gloves) in the Put the Blame on Mame number, which was thought daring in its day. After the war, a pressure grew in movies (it was censorship fighting desire) in which we were asked to imagine what a woman would look like without clothes. It was as if there was a cultural blooming that had to break out of its sheath.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8749e0b45810439cf78aef06eb200075d6597ae0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8749e0b45810439cf78aef06eb200075d6597ae0/0_180_2048_1229/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The dress on display at Christie\u2019s in Los Angeles, in 1999.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The dress on display at Christie\u2019s in Los Angeles, in 1999.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Scott Nelson/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Louis was an important figure in that history: he also did the black bathing suit that Deborah Kerr wears on an Hawaiian beach in From Here to Eternity, when she\u2019s rolling in the surf with Burt Lancaster. That scene looks charming now, but in 1953 it was close to the outrage audiences were urging. There was a silly British gangster film in 1960, Too Hot to Handle, where Jayne Mansfield wore such a dress, and about which the story was promoted that the movie was so risque a few extra sequins had had to be painted on to the film to protect (or fetishise) Jayne\u2019s nipples. But the Happy Birthday Mr President dress was the climax of this quest.</p> <p>That summer was a frenzied time for Marilyn, and there are signs of how far she yearned to break out of not just a dress, but every setup that imprisoned her. Twentieth Century Fox put her in a new picture, Something\u2019s Got to Give, for which she shot a promotional nude swimming scene \u2013 though censorship would not have allowed the sequence. It was as if she was breaking out already. Her illnesses or her anxieties slowed the film but then she took that unexpected excursion to New York to sing to JFK \u2013 and seemed camera-ready. Fox fired her and replaced her with Lee Remick.</p> <p>That swimming pool scene and a silent screen test she had done with George Cukor are the most radiant and eloquent things she ever put on moving film. And in the same summer, with Bert Stern, she shot some semi-nude still pictures \u2013 this became the famous \u201clast sitting\u201d where <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/53035820@N02/sets/72157629529716033/\">she seems to look like a would-be Kennedy or a plaintive beauty</a> more appealing for being freed from so many stereotypes.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d32b595c6c7fbaee12aaa8b8d49253e13ccf65de\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d32b595c6c7fbaee12aaa8b8d49253e13ccf65de/0_0_1500_1098/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Marilyn Monroe still wearing the dress, with Steve Smith, Kennedy\u2019s brother-in-law, at a reception at Madison Square Garden.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"732\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Marilyn Monroe still wearing the dress, with Steve Smith, Kennedy\u2019s brother-in-law, at a reception at Madison Square Garden.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cecil Stoughton/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There were also stories of a terrible weekend at the Cal-Neva Lodge, on the borders of California and Nevada, where Marilyn was passed around a circle of powerful men. The details are not clear, but you do not really want clarity. She was dead in just over a week, and that death (ahead of JFK\u2019s) <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-1299496/Marilyn-Monroes-weekend--told-time-eyewitnesss-account-row-Frank-Sinatra-friends-fear-signed-death-warrant.html\">would have so many stories told about it that we\u2019ll never know</a>.</p> <p>The dress remains, and I daresay it has provenance, although we are accustomed to be wary with such relics. Every now and then, people buy the Rosebud sled from Citizen Kane, amid mounting suspicion that there were several sleds. Why not? It was a movie, not a life in Colorado.</p> <p>The dress itself, with all its inserted rhinestones, was said to have cost $12,000 in 1962. In 1999, it was sold for $1.3m (then \u00a3790,000), <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/sep/07/marilyn-monroes-happy-birthday-mr-president-dress-for-sale\">and now it is up for auction again, with some other Monroe mementoes</a>. Should it be purchased by the Smithsonian, or will some Trump-like figure buy it, to wonder if any woman he knows would fit in it? The dress must be cold now \u2013 it\u2019s likely kept in a temperature-controlled vault \u2013 to guard against decay or disintegration. But one night in May 1962 it would have been the object of farcical preparation and infinite imagining. And for a few moments at least, it was warm.</p>",

It cannot without the intervention of parliament confer rights on individuals or deprive individuals of rights.\u201d</p> <p>At one point the judgment dismisses arguments deployed by lawyers for the government \u2013 about whether rights within the EU were conferred by act of parliament or international treaty \u2013 as being \u201cdivorced from reality\u201d.</p> <p>The judges said: \u201cThe reality is that parliament knew and intended that enactment of the European Communities Act 1972 would provide the foundation acquisition by British citizens of rights under EU law which they could enforce in other member states.</p> <p>They added that \u201cthe claimants are entitled to say that it would be surprising if they could be removed simply through action by the crown under its prerogative powers\u201d.</p> <p>They concluded: \u201cIn our judgment, the clear and necessary implication from these provisions taken separately and cumulatively is that parliament intended EU rights to have effect in domestic law and that this effect should not be capable of being undone or overridden by action taken by the crown in exercise of its prerogative powers.\u201d</p> <p>Part of the judges\u2019 reasoning was based on legal precedents dating back to the 13th century, in particular the Case of Proclamations. That case involved merchants who were prevented from working in London by proclamation of Henry IV which was found to be in breach of a parliamentary act dating back to 1297. Parliament triumphed and the crown had to withdraw its ban.</p> <ul> <li><em>Producing in-depth, thoughtful, well-reported journalism is difficult and expensive - but supporting us isn\u2019t.

  "<p>The future of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/ukip\" title=\"\">Ukip</a> has never looked more uncertain. After a tumultuous period that eventually delivered everything that the party wanted \u2013 first a referendum on the country\u2019s continued EU membership, then a national vote for Brexit \u2013 the self-anointed \u201cpeople\u2019s army\u201d has entered full-blown crisis mode.

There is no doubt that much will depend on whoever is elected to become its new leader. The party is currently in the midst of a fresh leadership election which, after the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/31/raheem-kassam-pulls-out-of-ukip-leadership-contest\" title=\"\">withdrawal of Farage\u2019s former chief of staff</a>, Raheem Kassam, is now essentially between two figures \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/23/ukip-paul-nuttall-suzanne-evans-stand-for-leadership\" title=\"\">Paul Nuttall and Evans</a>. Peter Whittle, Ukip\u2019s member of the London Assembly, is also standing and is respected among activists \u2013 but his chances of victory are considered slim.</p> <p>Nuttall and Evans represent different wings of the party and would each take Ukip down a very different path. Evans is seen by some in Ukip and the media as a competent performer but she lacks widespread support among grassroots members and, given her southern focus and general style, is unlikely to widen Ukip\u2019s appeal in those all-important northern Labour areas. Furthermore, her path to the leadership will be made more difficult by her party critics, who claim that Evans has repeatedly plotted against Farage and wants to abandon Ukip\u2019s position as a genuinely radical alternative to the Westminster parties. They have a point. In the age of Brexit, it is difficult to imagine a centre-leaning Ukip picking up many votes.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Should Nuttall win, then he will turn Ukip\u2019s cannons toward the 44 Labour seats where his party is in second place</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>This leaves Nuttall, an MEP from the north-west, a Liverpudlian, political historian and long-term ally of Farage who, for many years, was groomed to become his successor. Nuttall was one of the first in Ukip to talk about the electoral potential that lay hidden in Labour seats, and trudged through the streets of Oldham with Farage during a parliamentary byelection in 2011 when the two hatched a plan to take Labour areas more seriously. This was actually an important moment in the history of British politics. Ukip finished in fourth place, saving its deposit, and placing ahead of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/bnp\" title=\"\">the BNP</a>, which was still occupying minds.</p> <p>The result convinced the two men of the need to throw more effort into Labour territory, a decision that would have a real impact over the next five years, on Labour and Britain more generally. But Nuttall has also assiduously cultivated his networks among local Ukip branches and former leaders. It is telling, for instance, that during the current contest he has received endorsements from both the original generation of Ukippers \u2013 including former leader Jeffrey Titford \u2013 as well as much of the current group of Ukip MEPs. He is generally seen as a safe pair of hands, and is a strong speaker and a competent media performer, though some wonder whether he can match the charisma and political instincts of his mentor.</p> <p>Should Nuttall win, then it could be argued that Ukip has a chance to sustain its presence on the political landscape. Despite its severe internal problems, in the <a href=\"http://www.ukpolitical.info/General_election_polls.htm\" title=\"\">national opinion polls</a> the party continues to average over 10%. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/22/general-election-labour-crisis-jeremy-corbyn\" title=\"\">Jeremy Corbyn</a>\u2019s dismal ratings, combined with rising anxiety among leavers over the direction of Brexit, also offer clear opportunities to a radical populist party that defines itself as against the London establishment. Such openings are magnified by new research which suggests that at least 67% of the leave vote consists of voters who in <a href=\"http://www.britishelectionstudy.com/bes-impact/are-leave-voters-mainly-ukip-by-jonathan-mellon-and-geoffrey-evans/#.WBoxTZOLSi4\" title=\"\">recent years flirted with supporting Ukip</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"57394802f3687aa077f050e525f90ff6cd2c70f8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/57394802f3687aa077f050e525f90ff6cd2c70f8/38_21_4522_2715/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Suzanne Evans\u2019s critics claim she wants to abandon Ukip\u2019s position as a genuinely radical alternative to the Westminster parties.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Suzanne Evans\u2019s critics claim she wants to abandon Ukip\u2019s position as a genuinely radical alternative to the Westminster parties.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ray Tang/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Such statistics appear to support those like Banks and Kassam who argue that Ukip\u2019s future should not be as a moderate centrist alternative, but rather a Westminster-bashing, anti-immigration and Brexit-focused populist revolt. Throw in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/18/inflation-rise-uk-living-standards\" title=\"\">increased inflation</a> next year and the possibility of a fresh economic crisis, and it is possible to see other openings around the issue of social and economic inequality, especially among those white, working-class and left-behind Britons who are already aware of the Ukip brand.</p> <p>Yet while there will remain demand, much will depend upon supply, and whether or not the party can finally resolve its seemingly endless internal problems. Should Nuttall win the contest, as the betting markets expect, then he will undoubtedly turn Ukip\u2019s cannons directly toward the 44 Labour seats where his party is currently nestled in second place. A fresh set of local elections in the spring of 2017 also offer opportunities to gun after Labour votes in Wales, as well as try to sustain a strong presence in those southern Conservative heartlands (although given the posturing of Theresa May, this side of the Ukip coalition may be more difficult to retain).</p> <p>But Nuttall will also need to tread incredibly carefully. Despite Nuttall framing himself as the \u201cunity candidate\u201d, both Banks and younger activists like Kassam say he remains too closely aligned to Farage\u2019s critics, notably Hamilton. They want to see him purge those who have fallen out with their leader.</p> <p>Should Nuttall refuse, then he may find that he is unable to keep Banks, Kassam and, ultimately, Farage on side, and thus be prevented from using all of the resources that have essentially motored Ukip forwards. Should he agree, then he may find himself reigniting the infighting that has already caused so much turmoil. Either way, while there remains clear space for Ukip, or a party like Ukip, whoever is elected leader will almost certainly face a baptism of fire as they struggle to keep the various factions satisfied.</p>",

They reach merchant websites in many different ways: via general search engines, specialist search services, merchant platforms, social-media sites, and online ads served by various companies. </p> <p>\u201cAnd of course merchants are reaching consumers directly like never before. On the mobile web \u2013 and more than half of Europe\u2019s Internet traffic is mobile these days \u2013 dedicated apps are the most common way for consumers to shop.\u201d</p> <p>Adjoining the EC\u2019s updated charges, European competition commissioner, Margrethe Vestager, said the commission\u2019s preliminary investigation into Google Shopping revealed that Google had \u201cunduly favoured its own comparison shopping service in its general search result pages\u201d, meaning that \u201cconsumers may not see the most relevant results to their search queries\u201d.</p> <p>A Google spokesperson said: \u201cWe remain confident that these claims lack evidence and are wrong on the facts, the law, and the economics. The surest signs of dynamic competition in any market are low prices, abundant choices, and constant innovation \u2014 and that\u2019s a great description of shopping on the internet today.\u201d</p> <p>Google also responded to the charges made against its advertising services, Adsense for Search, which places contextual, text-based ads near and around search results.</p> <p>A Google spokesperson said: \u201cOur text ads help websites generate income and have always faced strong competition from other ad formats, so we disagree with the Commission\u2019s assessment. Nevertheless, even before the Statement of Objections was filed, we changed practices the Commission takes issue with, so we hope to resolve this case quickly.\u201d</p> <p>The EC originally <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/apr/15/google-faces-antitrust-action-from-eu-competition-watchdog\">filed charges in April 2015</a>, receiving a response from Google later that year.

  "<p>It\u2019s almost six months since Sadiq Khan became London mayor and opinion polls suggest that Londoners are <a href=\"http://www.standard.co.uk/news/mayor/sadiq-khan-given-poll-boost-after-first-two-months-in-office-a3292706.html\">pleased with him</a> so far. He\u2019s had a high public profile, addressing the capital\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.cityam.com/252475/london-security-six-things-sadiq-khan-considering-tackle\">security concerns</a>, making friends with <a href=\"http://www.politico.eu/article/sadiq-khan-backs-hillary-clinton/\">Hillary Clinton</a> and even being <a href=\"http://www.standard.co.uk/comment/comment/sarah-sands-sadiq-khan-has-shown-he-s-the-mayor-our-city-needs-now-a3337981.html\">lauded by the Evening Standard</a>. Khan has allied with London business groups and others to lobby national government for infrastructure investment and stronger devolved powers. Brexit, which he and most London voters opposed, has added <a href=\"https://www.london.gov.uk/press-releases/mayoral/mayor-sends-welcome-message-to-the-world\">edge and urgency</a> to this campaign. He\u2019s also made starts on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/14/londoners-overwhelmingly-back-sadiq-khans-air-pollution-crackdown\">tackling London\u2019s harmful air quality</a>, sizing up <a href=\"http://www.standard.co.uk/news/london/sadiq-khans-social-integration-chief-matthew-ryder-wants-londoners-to-live-side-by-side-a3340791.html\">barriers to social inclusion</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/davehillblog/2016/sep/23/sadiq-khans-new-tfl-boards-first-meeting-hopping-inclusive-and-refreshed\">recalibrating Transport for London</a> to meet some of his bolder policy goals.</p> <p>But his biggest challenge is what is now routinely called the London housing crisis. This is the issue Londoners are most concerned about. Accordingly, Khan dubbed the <a href=\"http://davehill.typepad.com/double_q_books/2016/08/one.html\">mayoral election</a> a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/davehillblog/2015/sep/30/sadiq-khan-london-mayoral-race-is-referendum-on-tory-housing-policy\">housing policy referendum</a>. A large part of his approach to this complex policy area will be trying to increase the delivery of homes that are affordable for people on low and middle incomes. Khan has so far not set a target for the absolute number of what he calls \u201cgenuinely affordable\u201d homes to be built in his four-year term, but he has committed to a long term goal of 50% of all new London dwellings meeting that definition. How well is he doing so far? What progress is he making towards honouring other housing pledges in <a href=\"http://www.sadiq.london/homes_for_londoners_manifesto\">his manifesto</a>?</p> <p>A lot of the work on housing has been hard graft behind the scenes. There is a widely shared view that Khan\u2019s deputy for housing and residential development, <a href=\"https://www.london.gov.uk/people/mayoral/james-murray\">James Murray</a>, has applied himself to the vast task with an energy, an intelligence and a political will that was lacking in Boris Johnson\u2019s time as mayor. He has been nurturing the broad consensus that unless London makes a better job of building the kinds of homes it and its people most need, everyone stands to lose - including the rest of the country. The goodwill of housing associations, boroughs of all political complexions, employers and commercial property developers has been sought. A dinner Murray had with new <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/housing-network/2016/jul/19/a-quick-guide-to-new-housing-and-planning-minister-gavin-barwell\">housing minister Gavin Barwell</a>, who is also <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/people/gavin-barwell\">minister for London</a> and MP for a <a href=\"http://www.gavinbarwell.com/\">marginal London constituency</a>, appears to have gone swimmingly.</p> <p>Khan has repeatedly stressed that altering the London housing equation so that it generates better results won\u2019t happen quickly or easily. Sooner or later, though, Londoners will want to start seeing solid results. What follows is a round-up of Khan\u2019s housing policy progress so far and some pointers to important things to come.</p> <h2>A trade-off with property developers</h2> <p>Later this year, after the government\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/autumn-statement-2016-date-confirmed\">autumn public spending statement on 23 November</a>, City Hall will issue its long-brewing <a href=\"https://www.london.gov.uk/what-we-do/planning/implementing-london-plan/supplementary-planning-guidance\">supplementary planning guidance</a> (SPG) designed to encourage higher \u201caffordable\u201d housing yields from planning deals struck between boroughs and property developers across the city. Like it or not, London depends heavily on private sector companies to finance and deliver buildings it needs - including much of its affordable housing. Inviting them to take a hike might get you a round of applause but, the ways things are now, won\u2019t help put roofs over people\u2019s heads.</p> <p>Khan\u2019s SPG will effectively offer developers an incentive to ensure that the proportion of affordable homes agreed for larger schemes meets a minimum level, expected to be 35%. London mayors have considerable powers to intervene in planning arrangements being worked out at borough level. The SPG will show Khan willing to give a fair wind to plans enshrining the desired percentage, but take a long, hard look at those that don\u2019t. The trade-off is that developers will benefit from the certainty this approach provides \u2013 they may have mastered the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/davehillblog/2014/oct/16/earls-court-questions-of-viability\">dark arts of viability</a>, but the attendant aggravation costs them time and money too. The SPG will also set out what types of home called \u201caffordable\u201d by national government meet Khan\u2019s more stringent definition of being \u201cgenuinely\u201d so.</p> <h2><strong>Increasing \u201caffordable\u201d supply with public money</strong></h2> <p>Khan has spent some of what\u2019s left of the <a href=\"https://www.london.gov.uk/what-we-do/housing-and-land/increasing-housing-supply/mayor%E2%80%99s-housing-covenant-2015-18-programme\">\u00a31.25bn provided to Boris Johnson for 2015-2018</a> to increase the \u201caffordable\u201d housing component of housing planned for the <a href=\"http://www.insidehousing.co.uk/khan-intervenes-to-increase-affordable-housing-on-old-oak-site/7016350.article\">first section of the vast Old Oak and Park Royal regeneration project</a> in west London (whose overall stewardship under Johnson he\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.standard.co.uk/news/london/old-oak-common-regeneration-is-branded-a-mess-in-sadiq-khan-review-a3383996.html\">described</a> as \u201ca mess\u201d). He will soon produce a successor to <a href=\"https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/the_mayors_housing_covenant_2015-18_programme_prospectus.pdf\">Johnson\u2019s funding prospectus</a>, outlining to housing associations and boroughs what it will take for them to secure grants from him. This will be published following the autumn statement. City Hall is lobbying for further funding for affordable homes. </p> <h2><strong>Building \u201caffordable\u201d homes on public land</strong></h2> <p>Prior to Khan\u2019s election, Transport for London (TfL) had named a panel of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/davehillblog/2016/feb/04/transport-for-london-names-partner-companies-for-land-development-drive\">developer partners</a> to work with on jointly profiting from building on over <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/davehillblog/2015/oct/20/transport-for-london-picks-first-300-acres-for-property-development-drive\">300 acres</a> on 75 sites in its large land portfolio. Its prime objective was to make as much money as it could for the city\u2019s transport systems. Khan, though, wants an overall <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-35465056\">50% of homes built on these sites </a>to be \u201cgenuinely affordable\u201d. His manifesto<a href=\"http://www.sadiq.london/homes_for_londoners_manifesto\"> specified</a> that these would be part-buy, part-rent shared ownership dwellings prioritised for first-time buyers who\u2019ve been renting for five years, especially in Outer London. It is another key strand of his drive to increase affordable housing supply.</p> <p>Since the election, Khan has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/davehillblog/2016/aug/23/london-housing-tfl-land-set-for-affordable-homes-as-sadiq-khan-picks-expert-team\">put in place</a> arrangements for 200 out of 400 homes he wants built on TfL land at Kidbrooke station to meet his requirements and urged the transport body to prioritise some of its smaller sites elsewhere. An <a href=\"https://www.london.gov.uk/press-releases/mayoral/mayor-fast-tracks-more-land-for-affordable-homes\">announcement</a> earlier this week concerned two of these. One is called Landmark Court near London Bridge station, which has been lined up for more than 100 homes, of which \u201cat least 35%\u201d will be affordable. The other is called Fenwick South, which is actually owned by Lambeth Council. The building of 55 social rented homes already planned for it as part of the agreement that will extend the Northern Line into Nine Elms will now begin early next year - sooner than expected. TfL will be responsible for delivering the homes, which will be owned and managed by Lambeth.</p> <h2><strong>A best practice guide for estate regeneration</strong> </h2> <p>Another way Khan could increase the supply of affordable homes would be by helping boroughs to add to the number on council-owned housing estates. Recent <a href=\"http://www.centreforlondon.org/publication/estate-densification/\">research</a> has emphasised that many of the biggest Inner London estates have already been rebuilt or replaced, but that the potential exists to \u201cdensify\u201d others to the tune of an estimated 4,000 to 8,000 homes a year. The problem is that such \u201cregenerations\u201d have the potential to be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/davehillblog/2016/oct/10/london-housing-improving-the-theory-and-practice-of-densifying-estates\">contentious, contested and to go very wrong</a> \u2013 not least for people living on them. One positive route through this difficult terrain is to find ways of \u201cdensifying\u201d without extensive demolition and temporary rehousing, with current residents directly benefiting from the results. When he was Islington Council\u2019s housing lead, James Murray <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/davehillblog/2015/aug/07/estate-regeneration-the-king-square-solution\">firmly favoured</a> the latter approach. A \u201cbest practice\u201d document, setting out the mayor\u2019s principles for getting estate regeneration right, is expected to be published by the end of this month.</p> <h2><strong>Introducing the London Living Rent </strong></h2> <p>Khan\u2019s plan to bring in a new private sector tenure with rents set at one third of average local household incomes \u2013 thereby fitting his definition of \u201cgenuinely affordable\u201d - was a major element of his housing manifesto. In September, he <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-37405991\">said</a> London households typically earning between \u00a335,000 and \u00a345,000 a year - which would cover couples each earning substantially less than the average London incomes - would qualify for <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-37405991\">these new homes</a> and be able to rent a two-bedroom flat for less than \u00a31,000 per month, compared with the London average of \u00a31,450. Subsequent <a href=\"https://www.london.gov.uk/what-we-do/housing-and-land/renting/london-living-rent#acc-i-41302\">published details</a> indicate that the eligible household income range could be as wide as \u00a325,000 to \u00a360,000, depending on the area of London. </p> <p>The mayor\u2019s intention is that this <a href=\"http://londonist.com/2016/09/mayor-announces-london-living-rent-to-help-blunt-the-housing-crisis\">new form of tenure</a> would enable tenants to save for mortgage deposits and <a href=\"http://www.insidehousing.co.uk/london-living-rent-confirmed-as-homeownership-product/7016863.article\">move on to home ownership</a>. It best described as \u201crent-indexing\u201d rather than rent controlled according to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f432c7aa-16bd-11e6-b197-a4af20d5575e\">one housing expert</a>, though at City Hall they prefer to describe it as a form of rent regulation applied to a specific type of affordable home. Housing providers have said they would be able to supply London Living Rent properties, though some political debate has centred on how far they\u2019d be affordable to renters earning the London Living Wage. The tenure period under <a href=\"https://www.london.gov.uk/what-we-do/housing-and-land/renting/london-living-rent#acc-i-41303\">London Living Rent terms</a> will be \u201cgenerally of up to five years\u201d, says City Hall. Hackney Council, which is eager to help young, middle income residents remain in the borough as well as sustaining its social housing delivery, has pledged to be the first to see 500 London Living Rent homes built. It is thought that the very first London Living Rent homes could start to be built next year.</p> <h2><strong>Understanding the impacts of foreign buyers</strong></h2> <p>Much blame for London\u2019s high housing costs is routinely aimed at foreign buyers investing in absurdly expensive \u201cprime central\u201d flats, but the true impacts of such finance and the use to which resulting properties are put are varied and unclear. Khan is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/davehillblog/2016/nov/01/london-housing-sadiq-khan-research-brief-recognises-need-for-overseas-investors\">commissioning independent research</a> into the phenomenon, hoping to get a fuller picture so that housing policy can be developed accordingly. Significantly, the remit for this research recognises that, for good or ill, overseas buyers continue to play a big part in enabling development in London to happen. Khan wants the final report delivered next spring.</p> <h2>Lessening the ill-effects of the Housing and Planning Act</h2> <p>During the <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/zac-versus-sadiq.html?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\">mayoral election campaign</a>, Khan\u2019s Conservative rival Zac Goldsmith made much of an amendment to a piece of legislation that even fellow Tories thought very bad for London and which Goldsmith claimed would enable the forced sale of council homes to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/davehillblog/2016/jan/11/what-will-zac-goldsmiths-2-for-1-housing-bill-amendment-achieve\">result</a> in twice as many \u201caffordable\u201d homes being built in the capital as would be lost. But the true impact of the Act in London cannot be fully assessed until its accompanying regulations are published, interpreting the various elements that leave room for discretion. The EU referendum and its turbulent aftermath have meant progress on this task has been slow. The appointment of Gavin Barwell as housing minister (see above) and his <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2016/09/13/government-edging-away-from-home-ownership-focus-says-housing-mi/\">suggestion</a> of a shift away from controversial \u201cstarter homes\u201d, thought largely useless as an \u201caffordable\u2019 product in London, towards supporting a wider range of relatively low cost homes, including for rent, have raised <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/housing-network/2016/oct/05/conservative-party-conference-hope-housing-crisis\">tentative hopes</a> that the worst aspects of the Act as they could affect the capital might be reduced.</p> <h2>Protecting the green belt</h2> <p>Housing supply <a href=\"http://www.ippr.org/major-programmes/london-housing-commission\">analysis</a> <a href=\"http://england.shelter.org.uk/professional_resources/policy_and_research/policy_library/policy_library_folder/report_when_brownfield_isnt_enough\">published</a> during the election campaign <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/davehillblog/2016/mar/29/which-london-mayor-candidate-will-fix-the-capitals-housing-crisis\">underlined</a> how difficult it will be to increase the number of homes built in London to the overall 50,000 a year it is generally held to need - a figure Khan has acknowledged but not committed to - without boroughs bringing forward some of their green belt land for building on. But the issue is politically explosive and Khan has gone to considerable lengths not to ignite it, both <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/davehillblog/2016/apr/23/london-mayor-race-zac-goldsmith-is-being-slippery-about-the-green-belt\">during the campaign</a> and since, <a href=\"https://www.london.gov.uk/press-releases/mayoral/sadiq-khan-pledges-support-for-green-belt\">making much</a> of his rejection of Tory Bromley Council\u2019s plans for a football stadium and flats to go on green belt land in Chislehurst.</p> <h2>A not-for-profit lettings agency</h2> <p>In his <a href=\"http://www.sadiq.london/homes_for_londoners_manifesto\">manifesto</a>, Khan promised to set up \u201ca London-wide, not-for-profit lettings agency for good landlords, building on the work that councils have started, and ending rip-off fees for renters\u201d. Word is that work has begun on this at City Hall, but it is at an early stage. </p> <h2>Stopping \u201caffordable rent\u201d conversions</h2> <p>A policy introduced by the Tory-led coalition government encouraged housing associations and councils to convert social rented homes to new, more expensive \u201caffordable rent\u201d tenures when they became vacant and were re-let to new people on waiting lists (with the strain often taken by housing benefit, the bill for which the government is actually trying to reduce). This was <a href=\"http://blog.shelter.org.uk/2014/12/does-affordable-rent-really-mean-the-end-of-social-housing/\">correctly seen</a> as a threat to social housing numbers at a time when more, not fewer, are needed. Khan, committed to protecting social housing in London as \u201ca vital asset\u201d, has moved to block these conversions. City Hall says that under Boris Johnson\u2019s\u2019s 2011-2015 affordable homes programme, a total of 19,000 were approved (see \u201cnotes to editors\u201d <a href=\"https://www.london.gov.uk/press-releases/mayoral/mayor-launches-london-living-rent-for-new-homes\">here</a>) with 14,000 of those now completed. The rate of conversions has slowed recently, but Khan <a href=\"https://www.london.gov.uk/press-releases/mayoral/mayor-launches-london-living-rent-for-new-homes\">says</a> he will work with housing associations through his affordable homes programme to put an end to them. </p> <h2>Homes for Londoners team</h2> <p>Khan promised to set up a \u201cnew and powerful team at the heart of City Hall\u201d to pull together all the mayor\u2019s housing powers and resources and \u201cbreak the homebuilding logjam\u201d. So far, a Homes of Londoners governance board has been formed, chaired by Khan - it will meet for the first time next month, after the autumn statement - a \u201cskills and capacity audit\u201d is underway and an in-house team of experts on development viability is being assembled with a view to making the provisions of the supplementary planning guidance stick (read more on that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/davehillblog/2016/aug/23/london-housing-tfl-land-set-for-affordable-homes-as-sadiq-khan-picks-expert-team\">here</a>). Perhaps the \u201cHomes for Londoners\u201d title is best understood as a banner flying above various forms of co-ordinated action. </p> <h2>Preparing for a new London Plan and housing strategy</h2> <p>Mayoral housing policy has to be in line with those enshrined in the London Plan, the name given to the mayor\u2019s statutory \u201cspatial development strategy\u201d for the capital. The current London Plan is Boris Johnson\u2019s. That doesn\u2019t mean Khan is totally hamstrung by it, but it does mean he needs to put it through a <a href=\"https://www.london.gov.uk/what-we-do/planning/london-plan/london-plan-full-review\">full review</a> which will result in a new version in up to three years\u2019 time. That review is underway with the launch of a consultation document called <a href=\"https://www.london.gov.uk/get-involved/have-your-say/all-consultations/city-all-londoners\">A City for All Londoners</a>. In this, Khan sets out the challenges posed by the capital\u2019s rapid growth and some of the ways he hopes to meet them, including in housing. Themes include some of those mentioned above and homelessness, including rough sleeping. The mayor will also be producing a specific housing strategy to replace Johnson\u2019s. It will come out some time next year. </p> <h2>Summary</h2> <p>The essential difference between Khan\u2019s approach to housing policy and that of his Tory predecessor is that the Labour mayor is, as you\u2019d expect, taking a more interventionist approach to shaping and regulating the huge, unruly beast that is the London housing market. He appears to be demonstrating far greater drive for getting more homes across the \u201cgenuinely affordable\u201d spectrum built. His mayoral team and City Hall officers are of a high calibre and have demonstrated the pragmatic, consensus-building approach that is fundamental to mayors getting things done. </p> <p>London\u2019s housing problems might be characterised as a combination of its booming successes over more than two decades and a consequence of successive national governments\u2019 inadequate responses to the failure of the market to respond in the right way to its demands. Housing shortages and other problems aren\u2019t new to London, and the current ones are beyond the power of any mayor to completely solve alone. But the hope is that Khan can provide strong, successful examples of how to make a start. </p>",
  "<p>A 160-year-old problem at the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/national-portrait-gallery\">National Portrait Gallery</a> will be fixed if it manages to raise \u00a3300,000 from the public to buy an unfinished portrait of the Duke of Wellington.</p> <p>The gallery on Thursday launched an appeal to help buy the portrait that would fill a significant hole in its collection \u2013 the lack of a significant depiction of one of British history\u2019s most important figures.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been seeking to remedy this gap since our founding in 1856,\u201d said the gallery\u2019s director, Nicholas Cullinan. \u201cThis has long been identified as a crucial omission in our collection.\u201d</p> <p>The gallery has been offered the chance to buy <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/feb/26/rarely-seen-painting-wellington-national-portrait-gallery-exhibition\">Sir Thomas Lawrence\u2019s unfinished portrait of Wellington, known as the Jersey portrait</a>, for \u00a31.3m. </p> <p>With a donation of \u00a3350,000 from the Art Fund and using its own funds, \u00a31m of the total has already been raised.

This is the one above all others that we wanted to pursue,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The portrait was commissioned a year after Wellington became prime minister by his friend and admirer Sarah Villiers, the Countess of Jersey, a leading society hostess and well-known gossip whose nickname was Silence.</p> <p>Lawrence died in 1830, leaving the portrait unfinished, although Lady Jersey could have had the artist\u2019s studio complete it had she wanted. It was a deliberate decision not to.</p> <p>There has been speculation that Lady Jersey, and Wellington, a serial philanderer, were more than just good friends. The historian Andrew Roberts said: \u201cFrankly, from what I know about Wellington and his love life, unless you can write it off, it is safer to assume he did sleep with whoever we are talking about.\u201d</p> <p>Roberts said Wellington was an extraordinary figure who was one of the greatest generals in British history. He remains the only person to go through the entire declension of the British peerage, beginning as the honourable Arthur Wellesley, before becoming Sir Arthur, Baron Wellington, Viscount Wellington, Earl of Wellington, Marquis of Wellington and, finally, Duke of Wellington.</p> <p>Roberts said the Lawrence portrait was a powerful one: \u201cYou can see in the face, this man is utterly driven, utterly competent, completely in control of his environment.\u201d</p> <p>The campaign to buy the portrait was backed by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/dan-snow\">the historian Dan Snow</a>. \u201cThe \u2018Iron Duke\u2019 is one of the towering figures of British history,\u201d he said. \u201cHe never lost a battle, reshaped Europe and dominated Britain until his death. </p> <p>\u201cHis career and legacy are intimately involved with the development of the United Kingdom. Now, more than 200 years after his most famous victory at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/may/15/battle-waterloo-news-aggregation-journalism-brian-cathcart\">the Battle of Waterloo</a>, it\u2019s time we helped the National Portrait Gallery win the day.\u201d</p> <p>The gallery tried unsuccessfully to buy another Lawrence portrait of Wellington about a decade ago.</p> <p>The present portrait was passed through Lady Jersey\u2019s family until <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.sothebys.com/en/auctions/ecatalogue/2013/old-master-british-paintings-evening-l13036/lot.42.html\">it came to the market in 2013 and was bought by the private collector</a> now offering it to the National Portrait Gallery.

A two party system does not work and the system in general will never work.

And before I could slap him, he explained to me about his inflatable, and we've been friends ever since.</p></div> </div> </div>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-581b3ff1e4b029b92ca45256\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-03T13:47:49.749Z\">1.47pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/16004776\">parsivalmontde</a> asks:</p> <p><em>Peaches, do you have a hard, nutty interior underneath your soft outer shell?</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-comment\" data-canonical-url=\"https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/86755293\">  <div class=\"d2-comment-embedded\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Comment\"> <div class=\"d2-left-col\"> <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/16901669\" title=\"View PeachesWebchat\u2019s profile\"> <img class=\"d2-avatar\" src=\"https://avatar.guim.co.uk/user/16901669\" height=\"40\" width=\"40\" alt=\"User avatar for PeachesWebchat\"> </a> <span class=\"d2-badge d2-badge-contributor d2-hidetext\" title=\"Guardian contributor\" itemprop=\"jobTitle\">Guardian contributor</span> </div> <div class=\"d2-right-col\"> <div itemscope itemprop=\"author\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"> <a class=\"d2-username\" href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/16901669\" title=\"View PeachesWebchat\u2019s profile\" itemprop=\"url\"> <span itemprop=\"givenName\">PeachesWebchat</span> </a> </div> <div class=\"d2-permalink\"> <a class=\"d2-datetime\" href=\"https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/86755293\" title=\"Link to this comment\" itemprop=\"datePublished\">03 November 2016 1:36pm</a> </div> <div class=\"d2-body\" itemprop=\"text\"><p>I do have a fuzzy outer layer...</p></div> </div> </div>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-581b3fbfe4b029b92ca45255\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-03T13:47:09.787Z\">1.47pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/12867743\">camillandersen</a> asks:</p> <p><em>Can you confirm your moniker came from a Nina Simone song: Four Women?

So rejoice, Daniel Hannan: the judges have heeded your earnest plea to make parliament supreme. Put out the bunting, Michael Gove: your insistence that Westminster be the ultimate arbiter of our national affairs has been given the judicial seal of approval. Let all those who spent the spring trumpeting the glory of England, hailing it as the mother of parliaments, now celebrate their victory.</p> <p>Except, of course, they won\u2019t. Those who campaigned for leave in the name of wresting power from Brussels to Westminster went strangely quiet when it came to the question decided by the court today: who has the power to trigger article 50? Suddenly they found that parliament was not quite so sacred or central \u2013 that some things were best left to ministers to decide. Well, the judges have called out that hypocrisy. They have decided that the Brexiteers should have to comply with their own logic \u2013 and bow to parliament.</p> <p>Does that mean, as Nigel Farage has said he fears, that a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Nigel_Farage/status/794123280613576705\">\u201cbetrayal\u201d</a> is imminent \u2013 that parliament might opt for a \u201chalf Brexit\u201d, as the former Ukip leader put it, or even that it might halt Brexit altogether? You can see why that\u2019s a possibility: the remain camp still has a majority in the Commons, when you add up not just Labour, the SNP and the Liberal Democrats but also the estimated <a href=\"http://www.conservativehome.com/parliament/2016/06/europe-how-conservative-mps-break-down-1-over-half-those-backing-remain-are-on-the-payroll.html\">185 Tory MPs</a> who wanted to stay in the EU. If they all united and voted as they did on 23 June, they could block Brexit tomorrow.</p> <p>They won\u2019t do that. Too many would regard it as a constitutional offence to go against the public\u2019s verdict delivered in the referendum. Others have a more practical fear of contradicting the wishes of their own local electorate, anxious they would pay the price with their own seats.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/nov/03/-three-judges-mps-vote-brexit-article-50-high-court\">Who are the judges who ruled that MPs should vote on Brexit?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But that fear will only fully kick in if Theresa May presents them with a straight, up-or-down choice: a one-line motion to trigger article 50 or not. If the choice is any less stark than that, if May proposes detailed legislation \u2013 then that would give anti-Brexit MPs plenty of wriggle room. They could say that while the public voted to leave, they did not vote for this <em>kind</em> of leave. That would give the remain majority in parliament the chance to slow things down and demand a much softer Brexit.</p> <p>Two other factors could prove decisive. The coherence of Labour in parliament now matters. If the party can get its act together and unite around, say, the demand that Britain remains a member of the single market then it will have real muscle. The early signs were not encouraging: recall that the first public figure to demand the immediate triggering of article 50 was Jeremy Corbyn, hours after the vote. But Keir Starmer and others have set a good lead: Labour needs to press the case against hard Brexit strongly and coherently.</p> <p>The other thing to remember is that parliament is not just the Commons. The Lords will have a say too. Unelected peers thwarting the will of the people may look like a democratic outrage. But Gove, Hannan and the rest can hardly complain. The Lords are an ancient part of our parliament. And parliament \u2013 as they never stopped reminding us \u2013 is sovereign.</p> <h2><br></h2> <h2><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/dreda-say-mitchell\">Dreda Say Mitchell</a>: If MPs attempt to overturn Brexit, public trust will fall even further</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"bdb343f7a8b22b4a0654e0a0103e302df9c85862\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bdb343f7a8b22b4a0654e0a0103e302df9c85862/0_0_280_280/280.png\" alt=\"Dreda Say Mitchell.\" width=\"280\" height=\"280\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>For those of us who voted leave in order to ensure that it\u2019s our MPs who make political decisions in this country, this morning\u2019s ruling in the high court is a nice irony.

And there\u2019s no doubt that MPs have the right to cancel Brexit if they choose to do so.</p> <p>But I would advise them to use their power respectfully and wisely. The reputation of the political classes in this country is already very low, and any attempt to overturn the referendum result is likely to send it down even further with baleful consequences.</p> <p>Whether it\u2019ll make any difference in the long run is a moot point. There are powerful vested interests in the UK already at work to get the ballot overturned or render it meaningless. There are equally powerful interests in the EU itself who are willing to help them out. Personally, I wouldn\u2019t bet against them succeeding. As the French, Dutch, Irish and Greeks have discovered, referendums in the EU are flexible friends. But that will leave a pertinent question \u2013 do votes actually count for anything in Europe these days, or are they merely glorified opinion polls?</p> <h2><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/tim-farron\">Tim Farron</a>: the public must get a say on the final Brexit deal</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"9edeb4fe8da31b16ea7f8937dba86cfab3cd812e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9edeb4fe8da31b16ea7f8937dba86cfab3cd812e/0_0_280_280/280.png\" alt=\"Tim Farron.\" width=\"280\" height=\"280\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Given the Conservative party\u2019s long-standing commitment to the principles of parliamentary representative democracy, it is disappointing that today\u2019s decision had to be made in the court. Ironically, a failure to consult elected representatives of the public on the terms of the negotiation package would undermine the very principles that David Davis, Boris Johnson and Liam Fox have championed. Hopefully, this will provide some much-needed clarity on what has been a completely chaotic showing from the government so far.</p> <p>It will be vital that parliament now works productively together to get the best possible negotiating deal to take to Europe. Given the strict two-year timetable of exiting the EU once article 50 is triggered, it is critical that the government now lays out its negotiations to parliament, before such a vote is held. So far, May\u2019s team have been all over the place when it comes to prioritising what is best for Britain, and it\u2019s time they pull their socks up and start taking this seriously.</p> <p>Ultimately, the British people voted for a departure but not for a destination, which is why what really matters is allowing them to vote again on the final deal, giving them the chance to say no to an irresponsible hard Brexit that risks our economy and our jobs.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/schonajolly\">Schona Jolly</a>: The government\u2019s appeal is unlikely to succeed</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1ee3e2419e7c657a03a5cc47d5b0b563dff525c5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1ee3e2419e7c657a03a5cc47d5b0b563dff525c5/0_0_4534_2721/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Prime minister Theresa May.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Prime minister Theresa May.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: WPA Pool/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The government has announced that it will appeal against a judgment by a UK court that restores sovereignty to the UK parliament to legislate for the UK\u2019s legal landscape.

Now parliament must save us | Polly Toynbee</a> </p> </aside>  <p>During three days of legal argument, the writing was on the wall for the government when it was forced to make the significant concession that article 50 is both unconditional and irrevocable. That might be true politically, but it is at least open to challenge legally. The irony of the government\u2019s appeal is that it now opens up the Pandora\u2019s box of whether the article 50 question on irreversibility can be answered only by the European court of justice. If so, what sort of delay will that entail?</p> <p>In my view, the government has poor prospects of succeeding in the supreme court. The high court\u2019s key reasoning is that the government \u201ccannot without the intervention of parliament confer rights on individuals or deprive individuals of rights\u201d. There is no answer to this. The removal of the ability to seek authoritative rulings of the European court, for example, is but one material change in our law, and it may have a profound impact on fundamental and social rights. So, too, other major rights merely \u201cglossed over\u201d by the government\u2019s arguments. I don\u2019t see a comeback to the various fatal gaps in the government\u2019s reasoning, which the court found to be flawed.</p> <p>The most fundamental rule of UK constitutional law is that parliament is sovereign, and that legislation enacted by both Houses of Parliament is supreme. If \u201cBrexit means Brexit\u201d, the court has confirmed that only parliament can trigger it. Both Houses of Parliament now need to stand up for the national interest and demand accountability from the executive, and for their constituents. The courts have done their bit for the rule of law.

Those who wanted to leave the EU campaigned on the basis of parliamentary sovereignty, so it would have been completely inconceivable for the executive to overreach its prerogative powers and trigger article 50 without any form of parliamentary scrutiny or approval.</p> <p>Parliament specifically legislated to hold an advisory, non-binding referendum, so it is now important that the government puts its plans before parliament so that MPs can scrutinise these plans before the decision on triggering article 50 and beginning the Brexit process.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/anand-menon\">Anand Menon</a>: This ruling won\u2019t halt Brexit, but further legitimise it</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"bc4d46cd6524dc3287ebe6e313a238590feac88e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bc4d46cd6524dc3287ebe6e313a238590feac88e/0_0_280_280/280.png\" alt=\"Anand Menon.\" width=\"280\" height=\"280\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Keep calm, everyone.

There will be no scope to modulate what is on the table.</p> <p>And this is as it should be. It\u2019s not as if politics was held in high regard before the referendum. I shudder to think what would happen if, following a unique democratic moment that mobilised the population in a way even elections fail to, a parliament that had approved the legislation providing for the vote decided to overturn it because it had come up with the \u201cwrong\u201d answer.</p> <p>And so to the final irony. The chances are this ruling will not halt Brexit, but further legitimise it. A judgment hailed by remainers will, ultimately, serve merely to place a parliamentary stamp of approval on an outcome they oppose.</p>",
  "<p>Hugo Lloris has said Tottenham Hotspur need a \u201cmiracle\u201d to qualify for the Champions League knockout rounds, after the disaster that was the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/nov/02/tottenham-bayer-leverkusen-champions-league-match-report\" title=\"\">1-0 defeat against Bayer Leverkusen</a> at Wembley on Wednesday night, and he accepted they would enter the north London derby against Arsenal on Sunday at a low ebb.</p> <p>The club captain was unusually vocal in his criticism of the team\u2019s collective efforts, which he said were the antithesis of those that had got them into Europe\u2019s elite competition in the first place. Lloris even suggested that the players had not fully grasped the importance of the occasion against Bayer.</p> <p>The defeat left Tottenham with four points in Group&#xa0;E, two behind Leverkusen and four short of the leaders, Monaco. They continue to control their destiny and they will advance if they win their remaining ties \u2013 away against Monaco and at home against CSKA Moscow.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/nov/03/tottenham-manager-mauricio-pochettino-wembley-defeat\">Mauricio Pochettino \u2018embarrassed\u2019 by Tottenham Hotspur\u2019s Wembley form</a> </p> </aside>  <p>However, anything less and they would have to rely on other results going their way and it is an illustration of the precarious nature of their situation that, if they did no more than draw in Monaco, they would be out if Leverkusen were to win at CSKA.</p> <p>\u201cWe cannot be in a worse situation,\u201d Lloris said. \u201cAfter a game like Leverkusen, we need to question ourselves. We need to learn about the Champions League. We worked a lot last season to get into the Champions League and we cannot waste everything. We need to be ready for the next two games and try to get the miracle.</p> <p>\u201cThe Leverkusen game was very important and I did not feel we were aware of that. Leverkusen did not play a great game. They were just well organised and had some chances, because we made too many mistakes. We need to learn quickly.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to think that we have already slipped out of this competition. We need to believe. It\u2019s true that we cannot be in a worse situation but that\u2019s football and, sometimes, you need to create a miracle. Before we think about the last game against CSKA, we need to think about Monaco, because it\u2019s maybe our last chance to believe in the qualification. It\u2019s very clear and very easy. We have two more games and we have to win the next game.\u201d</p> <p>The spectre of the derby at the Emirates Stadium looms large and Lloris did not hide from the fact that Tottenham had \u201clost a bit of confidence\u201d. Since their excellent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/02/tottenham-hotspur-manchester-city-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">2-0 home win against Manchester City</a> on 2&#xa0;October, they have failed to win in six matches, drawing four and losing two. They have scored only three goals during the sequence. Lloris stressed the need to refocus and pick up.</p> <p>\u201cIt is difficult to accept that kind of performance from us,\u201d Lloris said. \u201cIt was difficult to recognise the team. We are very aggressive and very calm under pressure, but against Leverkusen it was completely the opposite. We need to learn quickly because there is a big game on Sunday.</p> <p>\u201cWe will be back in a Premier League game in a great stadium, with a good pitch. We need to enjoy that kind of moment and stay united. I hope we are aware that the kind of game against Arsenal is a big opportunity for everyone to enjoy football, share a great moment of football with the fans and try to make them proud of us.</p> <p>\u201cIn football, you can win; you can lose. The most important thing is the feeling and the attitude that you show on the pitch. To be honest, the feeling was very bad [against Leverkusen]. It\u2019s difficult to accept that performance and it was the same case against Monaco [in the 2-1 defeat at Wembley in September].</p> <p>\u201cThe team used to be consistent in terms of performance and we\u2019re not used to losing.

  "<p>The current buildup of forces by Nato and Russia in eastern Europe is frighteningly reminiscent of the military escalation before the first world war.

State ceremonies are held at which well-drilled soldiers solemnly practise the rites of remembrance and members of the royal family, together with politicians past and present, line up to lay wreaths.</p> <p>Yet, despite the extensive recent retelling of the history of the 1914 war and detailed analysis of its causes, governments appear to have learned nothing.

The poppy represented mourning and regret, and served as a pledge that war must never happen again.</p> <p>Arguably this original meaning became subverted. By the 1930s, those alarmed at the militarism that had become associated with the Cenotaph rituals started wearing <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_poppy\">white poppies</a> to reinforce the peace pledge. By 1939, the world was at war again. Another generation signed up, though this time reluctantly, knowing they had to defeat an unprecedented evil, unleashed by the unresolved issues of the first world war that was spreading across Europe.</p> <p>When remembrance customs continued after 1945, they were little changed \u2013 except that on the war memorials up and down the country, a new list of names had been added.</p> <p>Over the decades, as the memory of both wars began to fade, the the poppy began to take on a subtle new meaning. To many people it had become a patriotic duty to wear one, a symbol of pride in the sacrifices of the armed services.

This would need to be done with care so as not to offend those to whom the current traditions are meaningful, but at the same time refocus the solemn national recollection of, and gratitude towards, those who have died.</p> <p>I would suggest several changes to the central Cenotaph service, which could be reflected in local ceremonies.</p> <p>First, that only the Queen, and not politicians, should lay a wreath. This would be on behalf of the nation and the commonwealth. Second, that a simple religious service be held following the two-minute silence. That no troops formally line up in uniform, there is no martial music and no gun fired. Third, that at the end of the service a line of victims of war, such as injured service men, widows, displaced civilians and refugees files past the cenotaph in silence.</p> <p>It would be appropriate too if next year the annual <a href=\"http://www.britishlegion.org.uk/remembrance/remembrance-events/festival-of-remembrance-2016/\">Festival of Remembrance</a> at the Royal Albert Hall be held for the last time.</p> <p>It should not be necessary for a charity to collect money to meet the medical and social needs of those who served in the military. This should be the responsibility of taxpayers. But until the government acknowledges this entire responsibility, poppies will still need to be sold to raise funds. Once the ethos of remembrance is refocused more people will again be able to wear a poppy in conscience, and hopefully the red flower of Flanders Field will once again serve as a pledge of peace.</p>",
  "<p>American audiences were so confused by the Edinburgh patois spoken by the cast of the original Trainspotting movie that <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/trainspotting-made-easy-for-americans-1349197.html\">producers famously re-dubbed the opening 20 minutes of an early US cut</a> to make it easier to understand. Thanks to the rather strange decision to title the sequel T2, filmgoers this time around are more likely to be left baffled when Arnold Schwarzenegger\u2019s red-eyed cyborg singularly fails to turn up and avert the machine apocalypse. </p> <p>At least there are plenty of other familiar faces in Danny Boyle\u2019s long-awaited return to the story of Rent Boy, Spud, Sick Boy and Begbie. Ewan McGregor, Ewen Bremner, Jonny Lee Miller and Robert Carlyle are all back, and there\u2019s even a prominent spot in the trailer for Kelly Macdonald\u2019s Diane Coulston, whose youthful reveal gave Renton such a shock all those years ago. But does this second, belated dose of Trainspotting course through the veins with all the glorious, destructive potency of the 1996 film? Or has somebody given us a weakened measure this time around? Here are five takeaways from the first full-length trailer.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e048406aa06deddeb81b9e660e4c1acf13e69c71\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e048406aa06deddeb81b9e660e4c1acf13e69c71/0_245_4928_2956/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Danny Boyle, left, and Ewan Bremner filming T2 earlier this year.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Choosing life \u2013 or nostalgia? \u2026 Danny Boyle, left, and Ewan Bremner filming T2 earlier this year.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jeff J Mitchell/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>1. Not all of the original cast have been using their moisturiser</h2> <p>Boyle joked back in 2008 that Trainspotting 2 would happen when actors such as McGregor and Miller had aged a little. \u201cThe problem is, they don\u2019t look any different at the moment from when Trainspotting was made,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.digitalspy.com/movies/news/a136783/boyle-discusses-trainspotting-sequel/\">he told the AV Club</a>. \u201cActors stay suspended in that timeless moment where they\u2019re moisturising and looking after themselves and making sure they keep fit and healthy, because it\u2019s their work, it\u2019s their future employment. But when time ravages them, we will be waiting for them.\u201d</p> <p>McGregor and Miller have clearly been looking after themselves, the latter in particular an impressively svelte 43. But Carlyle, to be fair always a decade older than his peers, could be 60 as Begbie despite the throwback Madchester-era fisherman\u2019s hat. And the years do not seem to have treated Bremner\u2019s hangdog, eternally gawping Spud well at all. </p> <h2>2. Renton is still choosing life, while Boyle has opted for nostalgia</h2> <p>The movie itself may yet be a different proposition, but this first full-length trailer is clearly on a mission to rekindle the passions of those who adored the first Trainspotting. McGregor is still harping on about lifestyle choices, but this time it\u2019s our reliance on social media and porn that\u2019s getting his goat. The sonic stun-gun that is Underworld\u2019s Born Slippy gets a run out, and there\u2019s a sense that Boyle will be doing his level best to recapture the wired, kinetic intensity of the original, complete with phantasmagorical segues and those sudden, thrilling instances of extreme violence.</p> <h2>3. Rent Boy\u2019s drug of choice this time around is something expensive and miscellaneous</h2> <p>Despite all its horrors \u2013 baby Dawn\u2019s death will always haunt our dreams \u2013 there was something genuinely life-affirming about the original Trainspotting. Boyle\u2019s electrifying vision of the culture clash between Thatcher\u2019s decaying, icy-hearted 80s Britain and the hopeful storm of the coming 90s rave era. Heroin\u2019s washed-out nihilism versus ecstasy\u2019s spiky hedonism.</p> <p>Surely to have anything like the same impact, part two will need to document a similar shift in the zeitgeist. But are we living in less interesting times? Boyle seems to be politely pointing out that, in 2016, drugs just aren\u2019t what they used to be. In any case, aren\u2019t our beloved gang of Edinburgh reprobates a bit old to be sniffing ersatz cocaine in their mid-40s?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6eba6a5c9e1cec377e6022b517698ec7d86e3771\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6eba6a5c9e1cec377e6022b517698ec7d86e3771/0_4_3469_2081/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ewen Bremner, Ewan McGregor and Robert Carlyle in the original Trainspotting\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ewen Bremner, Ewan McGregor and Robert Carlyle in the original Trainspotting</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/POLYGRAM FILMED ENTERTAI/Sportsphoto Ltd./Allstar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>4. It\u2019s not clear how much Porno we\u2019re expected to consume</h2> <p>Irvine Welsh\u2019s 2002 follow-up novel to Trainspotting centres on Renton\u2019s return to Edinburgh after a decade away running a nightclub in Amsterdam \u2013 a distinctly 90s pastime. Boyle has said he will only loosely adapt the original book, which makes sense as the porn industry backdrop that worked reasonably well in 2002 has since been swept away by the rise of free sites. But perhaps traces of Porno remain, as the young woman seen smiling winsomely at Renton might well be student turned amateur porn star Nikki Fuller-Smith \u2013 always one of Welsh\u2019s most unwieldy creations \u2013 from the original novel. </p> <h2>5. Begbie is still angry </h2> <p>Whether Porno\u2019s sex industry backdrop has been retained or not, Boyle has clearly kept the storyline surrounding Francis \u201cFranco\u201d Begbie\u2019s return home after years in prison, and there\u2019s a strong suggestion that the now-ageing thug hasn\u2019t forgiven Rent Boy for ripping him off all those years ago. Speaking of which, Sick Boy greets his old pal with a measure of relative bonhomie, given he was also a victim of that entirely reasonable betrayal. But beneath the snakelike charm, one suspects Miller\u2019s blonde barman might just be even more dangerous to our hero\u2019s hopes of making it to the final credits.</p>",

Also they are both Asian.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/aug/20/people-just-do-nothing-kurupt-fm-ibiza\">People Just Do Nothing: 'We're the Beatles of Brentford'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Or at least they are in the new short film Donald Mohammed Trump. Starring PJDN\u2019s Asim Chaudhry, it\u2019s a surreal satire that follows US politics\u2019 favourite grabber of genitalia as he\u2019s 20 minutes late to go onstage at a rally. The crowd are ready: they\u2019ve been pre-filled with a paranoid hatred of other cultures (they even demanded Bruce Springsteen\u2019s birth certificate after Born in the USA played). But there\u2019s a slight problem: their leader has inexplicably turned into a man of Asian appearance \u2013 not ideal for a politician with a reputation for whipping up a spot of Islamophobic hatred.</p> <p>\u201cI just loved the idea of making Trump face up to the reality of the things he preaches,\u201d says Chaudhry. In the film, Donald M Trump is hastily caked in quick-fix makeup, put in a wig and shoved onstage. His supporters do not react kindly. \u201cWhen you incite hatred, it never leads to beautiful things, does it? It always leads to violence.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDRgdMWenwc\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/IDRgdMWenwc?wmode=opaque\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>It\u2019s not the demonisation of Trump you might expect, though. This is partly because Chaudhry was told not to do an impersonation: \u201cI\u2019d watched hours and hours of Trump to get the accent right, then the director goes: \u2018Don\u2019t. I want you to be human\u2019.\u201d But mainly because it\u2019s more about the politics than the man; Chaudhry\u2019s portrayal leaves Trump seeming less like a monster than a puppet of dark forces beyond his control. \u201cThe message really is about the agenda,\u201d he explains. \u201cIt is about Trump, but only because he\u2019s the latest person preaching this stuff.\u201d This Trump isn\u2019t a Machiavellian villain; he\u2019s a fool with no idea what he\u2019s unleashing.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/feb/14/pop-culture-make-us-president-donald-trump-biff-back-to-the-future\">From Back to the Future's Biff to Donald Trump: how pop culture can make a president</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Playing him was still scary, though. And there\u2019s something deeply unsettling about the monumental makeover that let a 30-year-old Asian man play a 70-year old bequiffed caucasian. \u201cI looked like a monster!\u201d laughs Chaudhry. \u201cI couldn\u2019t leave the green room because I didn\u2019t want to scare kids.\u201d Not least because he bears a fair similarity to a certain ex-Mayor of London. \u201cI look exactly like Boris from behind!

But the Muslim ban is ridiculous. How would he even enforce it? Like, I\u2019m not a practicing Muslim but my mum is. How\u2019s that gonna work at the border?\u201d he sighs. \u201cUltimately though, I\u2019m worried about all the hatred.

  "<p>The story goes that when the German revolution of 1918 failed to abolish capitalism, Marxist intellectuals, centred around the <a href=\"http://www.goethe.de/wis/fut/prj/for/soz/en1214051.htm\" title=\"\">Institute of&#xa0;Social Research in Frankfurt</a>, decided to achieve their aims by other means. They would infiltrate the universities, there to disseminate doubt in authority, family, nation, high culture and capitalism. Stuart Jeffries begins his popular history of the <a href=\"http://www.iep.utm.edu/frankfur/\" title=\"\">Frankfurt school</a> with this strange version of its origins, favoured by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/anders-behring-breivik\" title=\"\">Anders Breivik</a> and the Daily Telegraph. As Jeffries puts it: \u201cIt was as if the proletariat had been found wanting and so had to be replaced as revolutionary agent by critical theorists.\u201d</p> <p><em>Grand Hotel Abyss</em> \u2013 taking its name from the more hardline Marxist philosopher Georg Luk\u00e1cs\u2019s derisive term for the Frankfurt school \u2013 attempts something rather daring. It sets out to be an easily accessible, funny history of one of the more formidable intellectual movements of the 20th century. This could be foolhardy, as some of the key concepts of the Frankfurt school are notoriously intractable, but unlike many of their successors in \u201ctheory\u201d, the Frankfurt thinkers \u2013 at various times, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/apr/01/negative-dialectics-frankfurt-school-adorno\" title=\"\">Theodor Adorno</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/video/2013/jul/23/max-horkheimer-critique-instrumental-reason-video\" title=\"\">Max Horkheimer</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2015/sep/26/walter-benjamins-legacy-75-years-on\" title=\"\">Walter Benjamin</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/feb/20/wantedanerichfrommparty\" title=\"\">Erich Fromm</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/apr/15/frankfurt-school-herbert-marcuse\" title=\"\">Herbert Marcuse</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jul/16/jurgen-habermas-eu-greece-debt-deal\" title=\"\">J\u00fcrgen Habermas</a> \u2013 were lucid writers, enemies of the portentous jargon of existentialism and phenomenology. However, you can be sure that Adorno \u2013 or, as he occasionally called himself, \u201cHektor Rottweiler\u201d, or \u201cHippo King\u201d \u2013 wouldn\u2019t have approved of Jeffries\u2019 jaunty writing style.</p> <p>This book is a group biography, which starts with the Jewish bourgeois childhoods shared by most of the school\u2019s protagonists, leading to some speculation about Oedipal motivations. This extends even to the manner in which the Institute of Social Research was formed, in the early 1920s. In Jeffries\u2019 telling, it was a gift from the world\u2019s largest grain trader, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermann_Weil\" title=\"\">Hermann Weil</a>, to his son, Felix. Although it had close links early on with the <a href=\"http://\" title=\"\">Marx-Engels Institute in Moscow</a>, there was a decision to avoid the controversial name \u201cInstitute of Marxism\u201d. The Institute for&#xa0;Social Research was a compromise choice, which didn\u2019t stop it being nicknamed \u201cCafe Marx\u201d.</p> <p>The school\u2019s early work, dominated by sociologist <a href=\"https://thecharnelhouse.org/2014/11/05/on-the-work-of-friedrich-pollock/\" title=\"\">Friedrich Pollock</a> and economist <a href=\"https://www.marxists.org/archive/grossman/\" title=\"\">Henryk Grossman</a>, was devoted to unsurprising socialist subjects such as \u201cinternational trade unions, strikes, sabotage\u201d. Jeffries sketches Frankfurt in the 20s, caught between the progressive Weimar era and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/sep/25/blitzed-norman-ohler-adolf-hitler-nazi-drug-abuse-interview\" title=\"\">the horrors that would follow</a>. The&#xa0;home of IG Farben and centre for modernist social housing, it would later become one of the major hubs of the Third Reich; Zyklon B was devised there. Franz Roeckle, the architect of the stripped classical HQ for this Jewish Marxist thinktank, was later a&#xa0;committed Nazi and murderer.</p> <p>The institute, with its private funding, stayed aloof both from the Social Democratic and Communist parties. \u201cAlready in 1923,\u201d when the organisation was formed, Jeffries tells us, \u201cGerman Marxism resembled the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WboggjN_G-4\" title=\"\">Judean People\u2019s movements in Monty Python\u2019s <em>Life of Brian</em></a>.\u201d Or not \u2013 given that it was divided into two mass parties with hundreds of thousands of members and millions of voters, a division based on genuine political differences. This moment indicates quite nicely the problems with this book: there\u2019s nothing inappropriate about pop cultural references, as readers of Adorno and Horkheimer\u2019s <em>Dialectic of Enlightenment</em> will appreciate \u2013 that book shifts from Immanuel Kant to Donald Duck and back. But it helps if they actually elucidate the point being made.</p> <p>Oddly, given how populist it is \u2013 an easy, witty, pacy read \u2013 <em>Grand Hotel Abyss</em> is weakest precisely on popular culture and the institute\u2019s engagement with it. This shift came when Horkheimer became the presiding force at&#xa0;the end of the 20s, moving it from political economy to, in&#xa0;his words, \u201claw, customs, fashion, public opinion, sports, leisure activities, lifestyle, etc\u201d. This is cultural Marxism as we know it.</p> <p>Mostly, however, Jeffries reproduces the standard idea of the institute standing in lofty judgment over mass culture, something that has long been questioned in studies such as Esther Leslie\u2019s <em>Hollywood Flatlands </em>or Frederick J Schwartz\u2019s <em>Blind Spots</em>. The&#xa0;two figures that were occasional residents in the grand hotel, Benjamin and Marcuse, are given their due as enduring influences on the new left and on student movements; but Horkheimer and Adorno remain the forbidding hotel managers.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"23e981b5c93067205ddfd801ec46ae5e2f0715ae\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/23e981b5c93067205ddfd801ec46ae5e2f0715ae/0_0_1067_696/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Heidelberg, 1964: Horkheimer, left, shakes hands with Adorno, as Habermas runs his hand through his hair in the background.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"652\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Heidelberg, 1964: Horkheimer, left, shakes hands with Adorno, as Habermas runs his hand through his hair in the background.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jeremy J. Shapiro</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Horkheimer once contended that \u201cthose who cannot speak of capitalism should keep silent on fascism\u201d; Jeffries misunderstands this as a comparison between capitalism and fascism, but he does trace very well the way in which the Frankfurt school and its thinkers were decisively affected by nazism, war and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/holocaust\" title=\"\">Holocaust</a>. Though the institute\u2019s inner circle escaped, eventually to California, Benjamin killed himself on the Spanish border, in fear of capture by the Gestapo. Some members even worked for the nascent CIA during the war.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Jeffries traces very well how the Frankfurt school was decisively affected by nazism, war and the Holocaust</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The institute had never had an official line on the USSR, but although some members, such as Grossman, and&#xa0;associates such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2013/apr/29/frankfurt-school-ernst-bloch-principle-of-hope\" title=\"\">Ernst Bloch</a> and Hanns Eisler, would go over to East Germany after 1945, most returned to the rebuilt school in the West. Jeffries is&#xa0;smart in outlining the compromises they made in the process. Adorno and Horkheimer claimed that they would have \u201clong since been killed\u201d had they opted for the GDR. Jeffries makes clear, though, that Horkheimer enforced, first on Benjamin in the late 30s, and later on the young Habermas in the 50s, a regime of mild censorship, coded language, subject avoidance and \u201cAesopian language\u201d that closely resembled the means by which critical Marxists such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/jul/22/philosophy-1968-the-year-of-revolt\" title=\"\">Leszek Ko\u0142akowski</a> or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/dec/01/christa-wolf\" title=\"\">Christa Wolf</a> survived within the eastern bloc.</p> <p>Their reaction to the emergence in the 60s of an explicitly Marxist new left was ambiguous. Horkheimer was horrified, and committed himself to the American struggle against North Vietnam, while Adorno shifted from embracing the student movement to moving suddenly against it, calling the cops on an occupation, which elicited the famous \u201c<em>Busenaktion</em>\u201d when students bared their breasts at him. He&#xa0;died soon afterwards.</p> <p>Marcuse\u2019s attitude was different. Already, work such as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eros_and_Civilization\" title=\"\"><em>Eros and Civilisation</em></a> showed a utopian optimism that contrasted with the sombre tone of Adorno\u2019s late writing; and when the student movement arrived, he told Adorno: \u201cI am willing to come to terms with patricide, even though it hurts sometimes.\u201d One of his students was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2014/dec/14/angela-davis-there-is-an-unbroken-line-of-police-violence-in-the-us-that-takes-us-all-the-way-back-to-the-days-of-slavery\" title=\"\">Angela Davis</a>, who is interviewed for the&#xa0;book; she tells Jeffries her writing on such singers as Ma Rainey, Bessie Smith and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/billie-holiday\" title=\"\">Billie Holiday</a> was influenced by Marcuse\u2019s \u201cnotions of art as a semi-autonomous zone or another dimension where utopias could be imagined\u201d.</p> <p>From there, though, the temperature drops, as Habermas brings the institute closer to mainstream liberalism, favouring strong institutions and the rule of law. \u201cOnly an academic,\u201d Jeffries notes, \u201ccould find \u2018constitutional patriotism\u2019 inspiring.\u201d The Frankfurt school, which began as a means of spreading revolutionary values, or so its critics \u2013 and some of its supporters \u2013 would contend, became committed to the defence of European order.

Thanks for them all. Read more about how our weekly readers recommend series works at the end of the piece.</strong></p> <p>What \u201cthe west\u201d is depends on where you\u2019re standing. For America\u2019s original colonisers, the west was the east: they were said to have came from Siberia around 20,000 years ago and surprisingly quickly took over the entire land mass. Over the next few centuries, stuff happened ... eventually the smallpox European explorers brought with them travelled faster than they could, and their explorations uncovered mostly empty towns and villages.</p> <p>But we begin with <strong>Louie Gonnie,</strong> an artist who, in memory of those Native Americans who survived, <a href=\"http://www.canyonrecords.com/shop/index.php?app=cms&amp;ns=display&amp;ref=AP_LouieGonnie\">describes his descendancy as from the Zuni people</a>, and his <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLvYp0vNEGY\">4 Peyote Songs</a>. <br></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3Yv36aUktyRVhABwR9Kwz0ZzFAG7mqZW\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/videoseries?wmode=opaque&list=PL3Yv36aUktyRVhABwR9Kwz0ZzFAG7mqZW\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>The YouTube list.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>The prairie in western folk song <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jDV6rD7UCg8\">Home on the Range</a> has become an almost mythical place, defined by a song which has shifted its relevance with each singer who has recorded it (this version is by <strong>Neil Young</strong>, but there are dozens). But its lyrics seem to encapsulate a dream, and maybe each singer is describing their own dream, their imagination of a perfect America, a perfectly possible one in which nature lives peacefully alongside prosperous man.</p> <p>After the mythology, the fantasy; a myth within a myth. Here is a Wild West that never existed then any more than Roy Rodgers\u2019 dude ranch outfits. However, a hyper-energetic, thigh-slapping, buckskin-clad tomboy <strong>Doris Day</strong> is a perfectly acceptable image. Unconsciously sexy \u2013 yeah right \u2013 she sings and dances brilliantly, with a level of comedic timing and naughty posturing that few could aspire to in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_xmujSyxkU\">The Deadwood Stage</a>, from Calamity Jane.</p> <p>In<strong> Jimmie Rodgers</strong>\u2019 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qEIBmGZxAhg\">Blue Yodel No. 1</a>, up next, we have one of the most influential figures in western music. Between the late 1920s and early 1930s he recorded incessantly, literally dozens of songs. Tuberculosis won in the end, at the young age of 35, which is a kind of irony considering he relied on a powerful vocal style that could project over some strongarm guitar playing</p> <p> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gtJkeXAMt0\">Shenandoah</a> is a river in the eastern states of Virginia and West Virginia, but in this <strong>Paul Robeson</strong> song the protagonist is working on the Missouri river, west of the Mississippi, while dreaming of home. The song has a long and profound history, apparently most likely referring to early fur trappers using the river road to bring their collections back to what passed for civilisation. They were often away for years \u2013 in this case, seven.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"c033de9453d903e4a0ce058a5d11cfb531d91929\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c033de9453d903e4a0ce058a5d11cfb531d91929/0_0_2048_854/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Trapper country\" width=\"1000\" height=\"417\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Trapper country.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Evere/REX/Shutterstock/Everett/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Whilst on the subject of trappers, they weren\u2019t all as pretty as Robert Redford in <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0068762/\">Jeremiah Johnson</a>.

We think of the cowboy as simply herding cattle, or sitting by his campfire, doing a fairly straightforward job. But there must have been some frightening times; the vagaries of the weather, wild animals, and the dark lonely nights when the shifting shadows conjured up images a man doesn\u2019t want to think about.</p> <p>Bobby Troup wanted to be a songwriter, so he drove across America to California to stake his claim. Once there he checked off on a map all of the towns he and his wife had driven through on their 10-day journey. Before he knew it, he\u2019d written a standard \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tg2EbJy-9dc\">Route 66</a>.

  "<p>Rob Savours is looking forward to his big 60th birthday party later this month. He\u2019s not long back from a Mediterranean cruise and, what with his photography, gym sessions, coffee mornings and one-day-a-week job at a local factory, life is pretty full. Most importantly, though, it\u2019s a life he chooses for himself with the help of support workers, who ensure that his learning disability is no barrier to him exercising choice and control.<br></p> <p>\u201cI say what I want to do, and when I want to do it, and the staff will take me out,\u201d says Savours, who shares a house in Gorseinon, Swansea, with three other people with learning disabilities. \u201cWhere I was before I didn\u2019t have much of a social life. Now I have a good social life.\u201d</p> <p>Christian Cowap, who helps support Savours, says the key to his satisfaction and wellbeing is that he is treated as an individual who happens to have a disability. \u201cIt\u2019s about being open and honest, allowing him to take risks, to make mistakes, but enabling him to be a person in his own right. We\u2019re all of us going to come to a brick wall sooner or later, when we need a little bit of help, and we should treat others as we would want to be treated ourselves.\u201d</p> <p>Cowap is a support manager with <a href=\"https://www.communitylives.co.uk\">Community Lives Consortium</a> (CLC), a not-for-profit social enterprise that uses co-operative principles in its decision-making and management. The 300 people with care needs that it supports, most of whom have learning disabilities, are treated as partners in the way it operates. In the words of chief executive Rick Wilson, it is \u201da company run by people\u201d.</p> <p>The example of CLC is held up by the Welsh government as the kind of venture it wants to foster under a three-year programme, <a href=\"http://www.everyonesbusiness.coop/en/2016/02/29/care-to-co-operate-our-new-social-care-project/\">Care to Co-operate</a>, which aims to develop the role of co-operatives, social enterprises and consortia in the care system. The programme, being run by the Wales Co-Op Training and Development Centre, reflects growing interest in the potential of not-for-profit care co-operatives.</p> <p>According to the Co-ops UK network, there are 88 co-operatives in the UK delivering adult social care, with a combined annual turnover of almost \u00a3100m. Only 33 of these are in England, however, where they represent less than 1% of the total market.</p> <p>\u201cCo-ops are still happening, but very much at the margin of the system,\u201d admits James Wright, Co-Ops UK\u2019s policy offier. \u201cBut a lot of the most interesting and hopeful stuff is to be found around the margins at the moment, rather than at the centre.\u201d</p> <p>In a new appraisal of the care system, the Co-operative Party, the political arm of the co-operative movement, argues that the dominant for-profit model of care provision has impaired quality, undermined pay and conditions and reduced cost-effectiveness. By contrast, a co-operative approach would empower both people who need care and care workers, reduce profit \u201cleakage\u201d from the system and help create a sector fit for the demands of the ageing population.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/social-care-network/2016/nov/02/social-care-threat-level-reaches-new-high\">Social care threat level reaches new high</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cIt is care recipients, their families and care workers who know how to create a care system that will deliver consistently high-quality care,\u201d says the party\u2019s report, <a href=\"https://party.coop/wp-content/blogs.dir/5/files/2016/09/taking-care-FINAL-web.pdf\">Taking Care</a>. \u201cThey should be allowed to lead the care sector.\u201d</p> <p>Wilson and CLC have been saying the same for years. The consortium was set up in 1989, initially as the West Glamorgan Housing Consortium, and it now employs some 770 staff to provide care and support to disabled people under contract to either Swansea or Neath Port Talbot councils.</p> <p>Could it grow farther afield? Wilson says it is \u201cprobably not\u201d interested in breaking into fresh territory \u2013 at least geographically. \u201cWhat we are interested in is breaking into new areas of capital and resources for change, supporting social care to become more efficient. There is increasing demand for care, but declining resources to meet that demand. If we rely on financial capital to do so, we are going to be pushed into a race to the bottom. So where do we find those other capitals?</p> <p>\u201cWhen you give the people you support a sense of ownership, they get quite skilled at knowing when things are not what they shouild be. They push us to use our resources ever more wisely.\u201d</p> <p>Of the 207 consortium members of CLC, 65 are people who receive support. Its 12-strong board of management includes two people who are supported, two family members (one of whom is chair) and two staff. Staff turnover is low by the standards of the sector: average length of stay is eight years and some staff have been with the consortium more than 20 years.</p> <p>\u201cWe call it \u2018social care\u2019 but in what way is it actually social?\u201d Wilson asks. \u201cWe are trying to think of it as \u2018social social care\u2019, not just enabling and supporting people to live together or in close proximity, but to do so in a way that uses their mutual skills, interests and ambitions.\u201d</p> <p>While CLC\u2019s history mirrors that of a number of care co-ops established 20-30 years ago, another group has emerged more recently as spin-outs from local authorities. Typical of these is <a href=\"http://www.leadinglives.org.uk\">Leading Lives</a> (LL), created in 2012 as a social enterprise and employee-owned co-operative from the former learning disabilty service of Suffok county council.</p> <p>A total of 390 staff transferred from the council on protected terms and conditions. Such has been the success of the venture that LL now employs 565 people, having taken over services provided by two other organisations, and has been making a surplus from day one for reinvestment \u2013 into annual staff bonuses (\u00a350 or \u00a3100 a time) and small grants to local community groups, amounting to \u00a375,000 and counting.</p> <p>Tony Carr, managing director, scoffs at any suggestion that LL has enjoyed preferential treatment from the county council. Although the co-op was awarded an initial three-year contract for services, when it came to re-tender it had to cut its price by 17% to win a two-year extension. Back-office costs have been reduced by 29% and staff recruited since 2012 are on inferior pension arrangements to those transferred across, and on different conditions, although Carr says their pay is \u201cpretty much the same\u201d.</p> <p>Growth has taken LL into new areas of work, with older people, those with physical disabilities and young people in transition from children\u2019s services, but the great majority of its 1,500 \u201ccustomers\u201d have learning disabilities. The organisation has also started to work in north-east Essex.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/social-care-network/2016/nov/01/the-three-conversations-model-turning-away-from-long-term-care\">The 'three conversations' model: turning away from long-term care</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Like CLC, it has a 12-strong board. But board members are all employees, nine of them elected, and external expertise is brought in at the top level only as and when required.</p> <p>Does that slow up decision-making and inhibit change? Far from it, says Carr. \u201cHaving spent 30 years in a local authority environment before this, I would say it\u2019s pretty nimble. The board meets once a month, but if we need an urgent decision we can call an extraordinary meeting. In four years we have done that twice. I can get a decision on the day if I really need to. I think that\u2019s quite agile.\u201d</p> <p>Carr believes co-ops could play a bigger role in the care sector, but sees them as only one model in an increasingly mixed economy. James Wright at Co-ops UK is equally measured in his expectations, looking to \u201creinsert\u201d a co-operative approach in some services that were outsourced direct to the private sector in the 1980s, 1990s and 2000s.</p> <p>\u201cPeople are desperately trying to find new ways of making the system work,\u201d says Wright. \u201cWe are part of that. And we are also part of getting the voluntary sector to operate in a more community-focused way. There is a lot of thinking going on, but such is the scale of the crisis that we do need to see more urgency.\u201d</p> <h2>Co-operative commissioning </h2> <p>Part of the transformation of care and health services in Plymouth was adoption of \u201cco-operative commissioning\u201d \u2013 the arrangement of services in association with care providers and those receiving care.</p> <p>Plymouth council described the practice as \u201can approach that puts citizens and outcomes at the centre of commissioning and creates stronger relationships between key stakeholders. [It] looks beyond cost and \u2018value for money\u2019 to put greater emphasis on the social costs and benefits of different ways to run services.\u201d</p> <p>The council\u2019s pioneering work is highlighted by the Co-operative Party in its report Taking Care. And although political control of the authority switched in May, its new Conservative leader, Ian Bowyer, insists it remains \u201cfully committed to co-operative commissioning principles\u201d.</p> <p>Bowyer says: \u201cAlthough we are not part of the co-operative councils network, this does not have any impact on our work around health and social care commissioning.\u201d</p> <h2>Care and Share Associates: \u2018Giving people a stake taps into their creativity\u2019</h2> <p>One of the biggest social care co-ops traces its origins back to the 1970s, when there was a burst of enthusiasm for workers\u2019 control in many sectors of the economy.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.casaltd.com/\">Care and Share Associates (Casa)</a>, which provides homecare across the north of England, was set up in 2004 but grew out of <a href=\"http://www.sunderlandhomecare.co.uk/\">Sunderland Home Care Associates (SHCA)</a>, which in turn came from Sunderlandia, a pioneering building co-operative set up in 1973.</p> <p>One of Casa\u2019s founders, Margaret Elliott, was married to a bricklayer who worked for Sunderlandia. She had the idea for a women\u2019s co-operative, Little Women, which opened first a food shop and nursery in 1976 and then, in 1983, a home help agency. A decade later, SHCA won its first council homecare contract.</p> <p>Although Elliott was instrumental in establishing Casa, which is based in Newcastle upon Tyne, SHCA has remained separate and continues to operate successfully. But Casa has grown from scratch to employ more than 850 people, who are also its owners; it provides 20,000 hours of care a week in the north-east, north-west and Leeds and has an annual turnover of \u00a314m.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve tapped into people\u2019s natural creativity and commitment by giving them a stake in their business,\u201d says Guy Turnbull, Casa\u2019s managing director and co-founder.</p> <p>The co-op sets recruits from, and invests in, low-income communities and has a strong track record of helping people break out of long-term unemployment, Turnbull says. Training is provided by the Casa Academy and employees are guaranteed a minimum 16 hours\u2019 work a week, holiday and sick pay and, after six months\u2019 probation, a profit share.</p> <p>Not that there is much profit to be made in the care market at the moment. \u201cWe\u2019re hardly making anything currently,\u201d Turnbull admits, \u201cbut because we don\u2019t have external shareholders, and we\u2019re backed by [social investor] Big Issue Invest, we don\u2019t have to make a 10% return like others do.\u201d DB</p>",
  "<p>The One Nation leader, Pauline Hanson, has issued a cryptic statement encouraging her Senate colleague Rod Culleton \u201cto make an informed decision on his future\u201d.<br></p> <p>Hanson issued the statement after a day of confusion about whether Culleton intended to vote in the Senate once parliament resumes next week despite facing the prospect of a high court proceeding to determine whether he is eligible to sit in parliament.</p> <p>The One Nation leader has been on the road in Queensland this week and on Thursday night issued a statement saying she had finalised briefings on Culleton\u2019s legal position.</p> <p>The government this week said it would ask the Senate <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/nov/02/challenge-election-one-nation-senator-rod-culleton\">to refer the question of Culleton\u2019s eligibility to the high court</a>. His eligibility to sit as a senator is being challenged by Bruce Bell, a former associate who claims that since Culleton had a larceny conviction at the July election, he was disqualified from being chosen by the voters in the 2016 election.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/03/will-it-be-such-a-loss-if-bob-day-and-rod-culleton-disappear-from-parliament\">Will it be such a loss if Bob Day and Rod Culleton disappear from parliament? | Richard Ackland</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Hanson said in the statement she had received advice from the clerk of the Senate that \u201cuntil a senator is declared not to be a senator, then section 23 of the constitution provides for each senator to have one vote\u201d.</p> <p>She said previous cases similar to Culleton\u2019s indicated he had a few options available to him, including taking a leave of absence, or staying on in the chamber and voting in divisions.</p> <p>Hanson noted that this was \u201cnot an easy time for Senator Culleton and his family and I have encouraged him to make an informed decision on his future\u201d.</p> <p>Hanson\u2019s statement follows a confusing 48 hours where Culleton indicated he would not vote on contentious government legislation, including two industrial relations bills, until his legal position was resolved.</p> <p>Then on Thursday, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/nov/03/rodney-culleton-asks-brandis-for-guarantee-he-can-keep-voting-in-senate\">he appeared to backtrack on that position</a>. Hanson\u2019s office told Guardian Australia Culleton had asked the attorney general, George Brandis, for a written commitment that if he casts votes in the Senate he will face no further legal challenge.</p> <p>The spokesman said Culleton wanted the confirmation in writing \u201cto ensure his vote remains within the law, so he can vote on the Australian Building and Construction Commission and Registered Organisations Commission legislation without further legal ramifications\u201d.</p> <p>A spokeswoman for Culleton later denied he had asked for a guarantee from Brandis that he would not face further legal challenge if he voted.<br></p> <p>The spokeswoman said Culleton was preparing to write to the clerk and president of the Senate seeking advice about his eligibility to vote.</p> <p>The issue was discussed by Culleton and Hanson on Wednesday night. Culleton\u2019s spokeswoman told Guardian Australia on Thursday the conversation \u201cremains confidential\u201d. She said no decision had been made about whether or not he would vote in the Senate in the coming weeks.</p> <p>The government signalled early on Thursday it may not bring on the two industrial bills for a vote in the final sitting weeks of the year, which kick off next week.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/01/bob-day-resigns-senate-effective-immediately\">resignation of Bob Day</a>, the Family First senator, and Culleton\u2019s initial suggestion that he may sit out votes, has thrown the government\u2019s carefully planned legislative program into chaos.</p> <p>Mitch Fifield, the manager for government business in the Senate, told ABC on Thursday morning the government was \u201cabsolutely committed\u201d to the Australian Building and Construction Commission bill <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/nov/03/senate-wrangles-to-delay-industrial-relations-bills-mitch-fifield-signals\">but he also refused to commit to bring it to a vote this year.</a></p> <p>The prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, told reporters in Sydney the government\u2019s agenda was not in chaos. Laughing at the suggestion, Turnbull said: \u201cSeriously, there are two crossbenchers whose eligibility will be considered by the high court. The rest of the crossbench are unaffected.\u201d</p> <p>He said the votes would be brought on when the Coalition had a good prospect of success. Turnbull said the government would bring on the bills \u201cwhen we believe there is a majority that will support it and on terms that we will accept\u201d. </p>",

  "<p>Even by world record standards, it sets a high bar for human performance. Next month in Las Vegas a chess player named Timur Gareyev plans to take on nearly 50 opponents at once. But that is not the hard part. While his challengers will play the games as normal, Gareyev himself will be blindfolded.</p> <p>The 28-year-old already stands out in the rarefied world of blindfold chess. He has a fondness for bright clothes, a hairstyle that morphs from mane to mohican, and he gets his kicks from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2010/aug/06/base-jumping-why-do-it\">Base jumping</a>. He has proved himself a contender, too. In a 10-hour chess marathon in 2013, Gareyev played 33 games in his head simultaneously. He won 29 and lost none. The skill has become his brand: he calls himself the Blindfold King.<br></p> <p>But Gareyev\u2019s prowess has drawn interest from beyond the chess-playing community. In the hope of understanding how he and others like him can perform such mental feats, researchers at the University of California in Los Angeles called him in for memory tests and brain scans. They now have their first results.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7d82171cc56b7539dfd0e9858032f926d3f5b71c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7d82171cc56b7539dfd0e9858032f926d3f5b71c/0_0_630_713/442.jpg\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2016-10-13 at 10.12.35\" width=\"442\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Standard memory tests showed nothing exceptional. However, brain scans suggest that Gareyev\u2019s visual network is more highly connected to other brain parts than usual</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jesse Rissman</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThe ability to play a game of chess with your eyes closed is not a far reach for most accomplished players,\u201d said Jesse Rissman, who runs a memory lab at UCLA. \u201cBut the thing that\u2019s so remarkable about Timur and a few other individuals is the number of games they can keep active at once. To me it is simply astonishing.\u201d<br></p> <p>Gareyev learned to play chess in Tashkent when he was six years old. Tutored by his grandfather, he entered his first tournament aged eight and soon became obsessed with competitions. At 16, he was crowned Asia\u2019s youngest ever chess grandmaster. He moved to the US soon after, where his obsession switched to poker, but as a student he still helped the University of Texas in Brownsville win its first national chess championship. In 2013, Gareyev was ranked the third best chess player in the US.<br></p> <p>To the uninitiated, blindfold chess seems to call for superhuman skill. But displays of the feat, also known as <em>sans voir</em>, go back centuries. The first recorded game in Europe played out in 13th-century Florence. In 1947, the Argentinian grandmaster Miguel Najdorf played 45 simultaneous games in his mind. He won 39 times in the 24-hour session and was reportedly unable to sleep for three days afterwards. For the Blindfold King\u2019s crown to sit more comfortably, he must beat the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/dec/30/chess-marc-lang-blindfold\">record 46 games</a> played at once by the German Marc Lang in 2011.<br></p> <p>Accomplished players can learn to play blind even without realising it. The nature of the game is to run through possible moves in the mind to see how they play out. From this, regular players develop a memory for the patterns the pieces make, the defences and attacks. \u201cYou recreate it in your mind,\u201d said Gareyev. \u2018A lot of players are capable of doing what I\u2019m doing.\u201d<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e48240caead4e7e541a0f4556c3d7d9f4271a88e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e48240caead4e7e541a0f4556c3d7d9f4271a88e/0_0_704_787/447.jpg\" alt=\"unnamed\" width=\"447\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The scans also found much greater than average communication between parts of Gareyev\u2019s brain that make up what is called the frontoparietal control network - used in almost every complex task</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jesse Rissman</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The real mental challenge comes from playing multiple games at once in the head. Not only must the positions of each piece on every board be memorised, they must be recalled faithfully when needed, updated with each player\u2019s moves, and then reliably stored again, so the brain can move on to the next board. Gareyev said that to remember each board, he must be focused and deliberate. \u201cIf I skip from one board to another too quickly, when I come back to it, it\u2019s not perfect and at times I\u2019ll mess up.\u201d First moves can be tough to remember because they are often so humdrum: a pawn in front of the king or queen advances two squares. But the end games are taxing too, as exhaustion sets in. When Gareyev is tired, his recall can get patchy. He sometimes makes moves based on only a fragmented memory of the pieces\u2019 positions.<br></p> <p>To train for the record attempt, Gareyev has been on a chess tour that builds in a hefty schedule of exercise and yoga backed up with healthy eating. Next week, he will play ten games blindfolded at the Society for Neuroscience meeting in San Diego. At the same conference, Rissman\u2019s team will unveil the latest results from their tests on the player.<br></p> <p>The scientists first had Gareyev perform some standard memory tests. These assessed his ability to hold numbers, pictures and words in mind. One classic test measures how many numbers a person can repeat, both forwards and backwards, soon after hearing them. Most people manage about seven. \u201cHe was not exceptional on any of these standard tests,\u201d said Rissman. \u201cWe didn\u2019t find anything other than playing chess that he seems to be supremely gifted at.\u201d<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"325e213e541a18a5ed06f83bc23229f9e34c4c94\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/325e213e541a18a5ed06f83bc23229f9e34c4c94/0_0_1862_1320/1000.jpg\" alt=\"This figure shows the functional connectivity between nodes in Gareyev\u2019s brain during a resting state.

With Gareyev lying down in the machine, Rissman looked at how well connected the various regions of the chess player\u2019s brain were. Though tentative and as yet unpublished, the scans found much greater than average communication between parts of Gareyev\u2019s brain that make up what is called the frontoparietal control network. Of 63 people scanned alongside the chess player, only one or two scored more highly on the measure. \u201cYou use this network in almost any complex task. It helps you to allocate attention, keep rules in mind, and work out whether you should be responding or not,\u201d said Rissman.<br></p> <p>It was not the only hint of something special in Gareyev\u2019s brain. The scans also suggest that Gareyev\u2019s visual network is more highly connected to other brain parts than usual. If confirmed in further work, the areas of his brain that process visual images - such as chess boards - may have stronger links to other brain regions, and so be more powerful than normal. While the analyses are not finalised yet, they may hold the first clues to Gareyev\u2019s extraordinary ability.<br></p> <p>For the world record attempt, a blindfolded Gareyev hopes to play 47 games at once in about 16 hours. He will need to win 80% to claim the title. \u201cI don\u2019t worry too much about the winning percentage, that\u2019s never been an issue for me,\u201d he said. \u201cThe most important part of blindfold chess for me is that I have found the one thing that I can fully dedicate myself to. I miss having an obsession.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>I am getting my son a new laptop for Christmas. My budget is around \u00a3500. He is adamant that he wants a 15in HP laptop \u2013 he won\u2019t be lugging it anywhere \u2013 but I\u2019ve also been looking at Dell and Asus ZenBooks. My question is: Can I future-proof my purchase to take him through his GCSEs to A-levels, or should I just go for an entry-level laptop with the view of replacing it in a couple of years?</p> <p>His usage will be mostly be Microsoft Office, web browsing and watching YouTube videos. From my headache-inducing searches of various forums and guides, I think my basic requirements would be a Core i5, 8GB and SSD (solid-state drive) storage. <strong>Marie</strong></p> <p>Hardly any of today\u2019s laptops are upgradeable, and the number gets smaller all the time. When laptops cost \u00a32,000 to \u00a34,000, it makes sense to provide upgrade options. When they cost around \u00a3150 to \u00a3600, people generally replace them rather than upgrade them. People also replace smartphones, fitness bands, digital watches, compact digital cameras and other gadgets in the same price range.</p> <p>The people who are buying high-priced laptops are usually looking for the best possible performance for gaming, video editing, computer-aided design and similar applications. They want to be able to upgrade their systems every year or so to improve performance and save time, which usually saves money. Typical upgrades include more memory, better graphics cards and bigger SSDs (solid-state drives).</p> <p>Corporate IT departments may also look for upgradeable laptops because they are simpler to maintain. Large companies will buy hundreds or even thousands of identical machines because it means they don\u2019t have to stock a lot of spares to do running repairs. They can also cannibalise broken machines to keep their fleets running. The <a href=\"http://www.zdnet.com/article/review-the-new-dell-latitude-e5470-is-a-great-laptop-for-windows-7-pro-users/\">Dell Latitude E5470</a>, which I reviewed at ZDNet.com, is a good example, but it\u2019s out of your price range.</p> <p>Consumer laptops are designed to be thinner, lighter and cheaper, so memory and storage chips are often soldered directly to the motherboard. They don\u2019t have removable backs or \u201caccess hatches\u201d because companies don\u2019t want users messing around inside.</p> <p>If you want to know if a laptop can be upgraded, try two things. First, check <a href=\"http://uk.crucial.com/gbr/en\">Crucial\u2019s website</a> to see if it offers memory or SSD upgrades for that specific model. Second, search for and download the laptop\u2019s service manual in PDF format. This will describe how to change parts that are changeable.</p> <h2>Meet Clevo</h2> <p>One exception is <a href=\"http://forum.notebookreview.com/threads/clevo-guide-v3-0-faq-and-reseller-info-read-before-posting.592609/\">Clevo</a>, which makes laptops that can be assembled and customised by resellers such as PC Specialist Ltd in the UK. (Sager sells Clevo laptops under its own brand name.) Many Clevo buyers are gamers looking for high-end specs, or techie Linux users, but you could get a 15.6in <a href=\"https://www.pcspecialist.co.uk/notebooks/ultraNoteIII-15/\">Clevo UltraNote III</a> within your budget.</p> <p>The base UltraNote III costs \u00a3357 with an Intel Celeron processor and 2GB of memory. Upgrading to an Intel Core i5-6200U, 8GB of memory and 120GB Samsung 750 SSD, while downgrading the optical drive to a read/write DVD, pushes the price up to \u00a3528. Upgrading the standard 1366 x 768-pixel screen to a much better 1920 x 1080-pixel IPS screen would add \u00a335.</p> <p>In sum, you can get an upgradeable laptop with the spec you want for \u00a3563, which is a bit more than your budget, but includes a three-year warranty. You could get it under budget by switching to a Core i3-6100U, which brings it down to \u00a3461.</p> <p>The UltraNote III can handle a Core i7-6500U processor, 16GB of memory, a 2TB SSD and a Blu-ray writer, so there are plenty of upgrade options, though you should discuss these with PC Specialist before buying.</p> <p>But your son is not going to need any upgrades, unless he starts doing some serious gaming or video-editing. Windows 10 and Microsoft Office (available free to most students) are relatively lightweight programs, and today\u2019s processors have no problems playing videos.</p> <h2>Desktop PCs and all-in-ones</h2> <p>If you don\u2019t actually need portability, do you have room for a desktop PC or an all-in-one? Desktop tower systems are far easier to upgrade or repair than laptops. You can easily change your desktop PC\u2019s screen, upgrade the graphics card, add numerous drives, or even change the motherboard and/or the processor.</p> <p>Tower systems are usually faster because the processor doesn\u2019t have to run in a confined space or use low power to extend battery life. They also last longer: I bought my last desktops in 2005 and 2011, and I expect the latter to last at least another three years or more.</p> <p>All-in-ones also have ergonomic advantages over laptops, and bigger screens, though most of them are not easy to upgrade. See my earlier answer, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/2016/oct/20/which-all-in-one-pc-should-i-buy-for-home-use\">which all-in-one PC should I buy for home use?</a></p> <h2>HP laptop choice</h2> <p>The laptop that most closely matches your request is the 15.6in <a href=\"http://www.pcworld.co.uk/gbuk/computing/laptops/laptops/hp-pavilion-15-au074sa-15-6-laptop-silver-10146646-pdt.html\">HP Pavilion 15-au074sa</a>, which is going for \u00a3479.99 at Currys PC World, though you may be able to find it elsewhere. This has a Core i5-6200U, 8GB of memory and a 256GB SSD. Its main drawback is its limited 1366 x 768-pixel screen, though it\u2019s not untypical for this class of machine.</p> <p>The Pavilion 15-au074sa isn\u2019t upgradeable, but you probably won\u2019t need to upgrade it. Many university students and business users still have laptops with 4GB of memory and conventional hard drives, and very few users have more than 8GB. Many casual users only have 2GB.</p> <p>Somebody who spends \u00a3999.99 on a 13.3in HP Spectre x360 will also get a Core i5-6200U, 8GB of memory and 256GB SSD, although the Spectre has other advantages. For example, it has a much better 1920 x 1080-pixel IPS touch screen, and a tougher, thinner and more stylish design. What it won\u2019t do is run Microsoft Word noticeably faster.</p> <p>Whether your HP Pavilion 15 will need replacing has less to do with the specification than its durability, and how well it\u2019s looked after. Careless kids can destroy a laptop such as this in a year, by repeatedly picking it up by the screen \u2013 which breaks the hinges \u2013 or dropping it on a hard floor. If properly cared for, a Core i5 laptop should survive A-levels and university use.</p> <h2>Cheaper options</h2> <p>There are, obviously, lots of cheaper options. For some examples, see my recent answer, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/2016/sep/01/which-laptop-should-i-buy-my-youtube-friendly-14-year-old\">Which laptop should I buy my YouTube-friendly 14-year-old?</a> Cheap laptops typically have much slower processors, only 4GB of memory and rotating hard drives, so they are not necessarily better value. However, a machine such as an Asus X540LA with a Core i3-5005U, 4GB of memory and 1TB hard drive (<a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/ASUS-Notebook-i3-5005U-Processor-Windows/dp/B01HIWOJYK/\">\u00a3305</a>) would be powerful enough for most students.</p> <p>If you want to consider a disposable entry-level option, look at the <a href=\"http://www.johnlewis.com/hp-pavilion-x2-detachable-laptop-intel-atom-2gb-ram-64gb-emmc-10-1-touch-screen-with-free-ms-office-mobile-sunset-red/p2491743\">HP Pavilion x2</a> detachable. This has a quad-core Intel Atom Z8300, 2GB of memory and 64GB of eMMC Flash memory for \u00a3219.95. Try to avoid models with 32GB of storage because Windows 10 is probably going to be re-installed twice a year.</p> <p>The Pavilion x2 is an ultra-portable that doubles as a 10in tablet, has a usable keyboard and feels durable for the price. It\u2019s my first thought when anyone asks for a cheap computer for a child.</p> <p>Have you got a question? Email it to Ask.Jack@theguardian.com</p>",
  "<p>Hundreds of descendants of Jewish refugees, who fled to Britain to escape Nazi persecution, are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/30/uk-descendants-of-jewish-refugees-seek-german-citizenship-after-brexit-vote\" title=\"\">investigating the possibility of becoming German citizens</a> in the wake of the Brexit vote. Under the legislation that states that any descendants of people persecuted by the Nazis are eligible for German citizenship, authorities report a twentyfold upsurge in inquiries. I am one of those who would be eligible. My Jewish family was all but destroyed by the Nazi regime bar my Opa (grandfather), who was sent to England by his parents as a 16 year old, never to see his family again.</p> <p>And I, like many people my age, was devastated by the result of the EU referendum. If someone had told me the day after the Brexit vote that there was a way of accessing EU citizenship, I would have jumped at the chance. But yet, the very idea of taking on German identity feels wrong to me.</p> <p>It\u2019s difficult. Should I take advantage of what is essentially reparation for anyone persecuted under the Nazi regime and their descendants? It would feel like betraying the remnants of Jewish identity that my family holds on to. I have always rejected any notion of being German. When asked about my background I have described myself as \u201cpart-English part-Jewish\u201d, despite my family living in Germany for centuries. The barbaric treatment the German state inflicted upon my relatives and the actions of the Nazi regime removed any positive association or connection to the country for me.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/30/uk-descendants-of-jewish-refugees-seek-german-citizenship-after-brexit-vote\">Descendants of Jewish refugees seek German citizenship after Brexit vote</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Opa, despite his choice to use the German name, continued to have a difficult relationship with Germany throughout his life. He would not teach his children German as the language evoked too much pain. He anglicised his name, took on a British identity and abandoned any connection to Germany. In the first few decades after his arrival in Britain it was unthinkable that his family would take on German citizenship. Opa\u2019s views did soften slowly over time, and being made a freeman of the city of Frankfurt, where he grew up, was an important step in the rehabilitation process. Yet Germany remained a place where everything he held dear as a child was lost. He never forgot that, and nor did we.</p> <p>Of course, I do understand that modern-day Germany must be separated from the Nazi regime. This summer I visited Frankfurt and did not feel the resentment towards the city that I expected, partly due the numerous efforts of the city to commemorate the Holocaust and its once-flourishing Jewish community. However, as I sat looking at the house my great-grandfather, great-grandmother and great uncle were deported from, I realised that despite all the city and the country had to offer, it would always remain to me the place that attempted to exterminate my family.</p> <p>Of course, being part of the EU is tempting for a 20-year-old student like me. Freedom of movement around Europe, potential future employment across EU states, and furthering my education in Europe would all be up for grabs. Surely, I would be foolish to close that door?</p> <p>And yet a nagging feeling of guilt persists. I do not have any family members alive who experienced the Nazi regime to provide advice. Perhaps they would want me to take advantage of this gesture of reconciliation. But what if they felt betrayed? I had perhaps underestimated what a raw issue the Holocaust remains for me. The feelings of anger and grief are overwhelming and inescapable when the Holocaust is mentioned.</p> <p>Germany\u2019s willingness to accept hundreds of thousands of Syrian refugees reminds me how far the country has come in a relatively short period. Its open policy, especially compared with Britain\u2019s, warms me to the idea of joining these new residents. It is another example of post-unification Germany doing all it can to make up for the horrors of the past. However, while it promises progress, it does not undo the fundamental reservations I hold.</p> <p>Of course, I am not suggesting that anyone who does choose to \u201cbecome German\u201d is betraying their Jewish roots \u2013 this is a very personal dilemma. And I am conscious that rejecting this opportunity is partly allowing the past to shape my future. But, in the words of historian Dalia Ofer, the Holocaust is a history of \u201cthe past that does not pass\u201d. I cannot move past the Holocaust, and signing up for a German passport would suggest otherwise.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>Comments will be switched on shortly after 11am</em></p>",

  "<p>On the northern edge of the sprawling Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex, the bright lights of a beloved Texas Friday night tradition burn as bright as they\u2019ve always done. In the town of Celina, high school football games remain an intimate experience, almost as if plucked from the pages of Friday Night Lights, Buzz Bissinger\u2019s book that spawned famous film and TV adaptations.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2016/oct/28/nfl-football-tv-ratings-drop\">Mediocrity on turf: the NFL is stumbling, but will it recover?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cWhen you enter the current Bobcat field, you\u2019re right there on the field,\u201d says Rudy Weems. Like many born and raised in Celina, Weems relates the Celina high school football heritage:a jointly held record of eight state championships \u2013 incredible for a town of its small size. The 50-year-old father of three played for the Celina Bobcats in the early 1980s. In adulthood, he volunteered as a coach. His two sons, aged 28 and 19, followed him into the program. Here, football knits the community together.</p> <p>But Weems is also aware of Celina\u2019s ballooning population. Currently figured to be around 11,000, it\u2019s expected to reach 100,000 within 10 years, according to one projection. That\u2019s up from just 6,000 in 2010.</p> <p>\u201cThe growth is coming to Celina, we know that,\u201d says Weems. \u201cHowever, it\u2019s still a small-town feel. People are moving from the south \u2013 Frisco, Plano, McKinney, Allen. We\u2019re still moving that way, but once you enter the town, you still get the feel of a small town. We know it\u2019s growing, and along with it comes a lot of politics and a lot of changes.\u201d</p> <p>In the middle of the change from small town to booming Dallas suburb is football. Celina could end up with more than one high school and therefore more than one football team, a division of the local talent pool that would vex some. But a more immediate question is over the future need for a new stadium to house the existing team and its swelling fanbase. The current 3,800-capacity Bobcat Stadium, regularly packed, might soon be unable to cope with demand.</p> <p>These are interesting times for high school football stadiums in Texas. Nearby McKinney recently approved the construction of a new $70m, 12,000-seat stadium to be shared by the city\u2019s three high schools. That followed hard on the heels of a $60m, 18,000-capacity venue for neighboring Allen \u2013 which has one high school \u2013 completed in 2012. Local media have called the sprouting of expensive stadiums among rival school districts in affluent suburbs an arms race. The adjacent Frisco, meanwhile, entered a partnership with the Dallas Cowboys for its schools to play in the NFL team\u2019s new indoor practice facility built in the city. The Frisco independent school district is chipping in $30m so area kids can run out at The Ford Center at The Star, capacity 12,000.</p> <p>Critics argue the money could be better spent elsewhere in the education system. The defenders say the cash isn\u2019t taken away from pots protected for schooling.</p> <p>\u201cYes, there is this concept that \u2018we want the best for our students,\u2019\u201d says Lee Ancona, a University of North Texas lecturer in health promotion and recreation, who spent more than 30 years coaching high school football in Texas. \u201cPeople pay more taxes and are willing to support these stadiums and facilities that from the outside looking in look terribly grandiose or overdone to some degree. But I haven\u2019t heard any apologies. People aren\u2019t apologizing for having good facilities for their students, and obviously especially for athletes.\u201d </p> <p>In the 2015-16 school year, school districts budgeted 2.75% of their funds for extracurricular activities, according to the Texas education agency. \u201cAcademics always have a much, much greater share of the budget than do sports,\u201d a spokesperson told the Guardian.</p> <p>Perched on the precipice is Celina. It lies somewhere at the intersection between small rural town and DFW\u2019s fast approaching conurbation, explains Bill Elliott, the Bobcats head coach and the Celina school district\u2019s athletic director. A new stadium is a definite part of their future but just what shape it takes is another matter.</p> <p>Elliott doesn\u2019t grudge Allen and McKinney their new stadiums: he sees them as a boon for their communities \u2013 and revenue generators. Kids from smaller towns like his look forward to the opportunity to play in them. Elliott says the impact of these pricey arenas leads to scaled-down improvements further down the food chain.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen it both ways. When I came here we had a grass field, a rock parking lot. Now we\u2019ve got a nice paved one and we\u2019ve got a turf field. We were one of the first small schools in the area to get a turf field. And now you see in the smaller schools we play, they\u2019ve all got turf fields now. It\u2019s just more cost-effective. It flows down. I think it\u2019s the same thing with stadiums. As these communities, these outlying communities, grow, that same thing is going to flow down to them.\u201d</p> <p>Across the state, new stadiums are sprouting. And it\u2019s not confined to the affluent suburbs of major cities like Dallas and Houston.</p> <p>Take the recently opened new stadium in Whitney, a rural town between Fort Worth and Waco. The local school district produced a new 3,000-seat, $6.4m venue. Wildcat Stadium serves Whitney High, classed as a 3A school in the classification system governing Texas high school sports. (McKinney, Allen and Frisco operate at the 6A level; Celina at 4A. The system \u2013 ranging from 1A up to 6A \u2013 is based on school enrollment numbers, with 3A schools bearing between 229 and 479 students.) Among other amenities, the new site features a video board and a media room replete with a 100-inch projection screen and 55-inch monitors.</p> <p>Since 1996, some 60 bonds have been issued by ISDs in Texas school districts, with at least the partial purpose of building a new stadium or renovating existing athletic facilities.</p> <p>The funding of public education in Texas is controversial, with local property tax revenues a major contributor of the money. A so-called Robin Hood law stipulates that property-wealthy districts share their property tax wealth with districts considered property poor.</p> <p>However, in most cases new stadiums are funded by bonds approved at the ballot box by voters living within the relevant school district. And as tax money used to repay these bonds is exempt from wealth equalization, school districts are free to use this local money for the construction of new facilities at the discretion of local voters. Robin Hood does not apply.</p> <p>That can have interesting consequences. In 2012, Carthage, a small town in east Texas, added a 1,200 sq ft, $750,000 video scoreboard to its then four-year-old stadium. The purchase was hailed as a way of keeping locally raised money within the district from which it was drawn.</p> <p>Some point to Dallas-Fort Worth suburb of Southlake as the progenitor of the surge in high school mega-stadiums with eye-watering price tags. In 2001, the city spent $15.3m on Dragon Stadium. Bob McSpadden, an expert on the more than 1,200 high school stadiums in Texas, says the famous Ratliff Stadium in Odessa, of Friday Night Lights fame, was causing a stir in the 1980s. \u201cThat stadium was outrageous at $5.6m in 1982,\u201d he explains.</p> <p>Not all bond packages that include stadiums pass muster for local voters. McSpadden, who grew up in Odessa, points to a new mega-stadium currently under construction in his current home of Katy, a suburb of Houston, as evidence.</p> <p>\u201cA lot of these stadiums do not pass the vote. The one here in Katy failed once. Ratliff Stadium back in the 80s failed three times before it was passed. But it wasn\u2019t over the money; it was over the location.\u201d The 12,000-seat Katy stadium finally passed at the end of 2014, a year after being rejected at the ballot box. Like many of these bonds, it was part of a greater $748m package that also included allotments for the construction of new schools. The stadium portion: $58m, a figure that later rose to $62.5m.</p> <p>Other high school stadiums with big price tags get less attention. Channelview, another Houston suburb, got a new 8,000-seat venue costing $27m in 2012. Clear Creek, also in the Houston area, saw a $42m, 10,000 arena approved in 2013. Sometimes there are standalone outlays for flashy accessories that draw some scrutiny. The board of Waxahachie school district recently approved the purchase of a $500,000 digital scoreboard for its Lumpkins Stadium. Nevertheless, there was a word of caution from the school superintendent, who identified the scoreboard as a luxury item, reminding members the \u201cdistrict is not a rich district.\u201d</p> <p>Some argue the stadiums provide lucrative revenues streams \u2013 scoreboards, for example, could be attractive to advertisers. Particularly in the south, the popularity of high school football is immense. Texas might be considered the epicenter.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s kind of a mirror image of college in a way,\u201d says Mark Conrad, an expert in sports business at Fordham University. \u201cWhere the colleges have gone to 30 years ago, you\u2019re beginning to see power conferences or power schools in high school.\u201d</p> <p>Others can\u2019t afford to focus too much on athletics. The troubled Dallas school district and its string of inner-city schools is one. There, says the school district\u2019s athletic director Gil Garza, they are preoccupied with improving education attainment levels.</p> <p>\u201cWe have nine stadiums, one that I would say is a mini-monster like the others,\u201d he explains. \u201cKincaide Stadium, which seats about 12,000. It\u2019s nice, but it\u2019s not anywhere near what you see in Allen, Frisco or McKinney or even some of the other districts. Having said that, there\u2019s eight more that are not. The overlying thought in our process is to try to make them as nice and modern as we can. Because kids look at those facilities. They see what other communities have and say: \u2018Well, why can\u2019t we have that?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>The answer, says Garza, comes down to his school district\u2019s sheer size, large portfolio of facilities and its focus on academics. \u201cBecause sometimes we come to school and our kids are behind,\u201d he adds. \u201cA lot of people in our communities would rather see that than see $25m, $40m stadiums.\u201d</p> <p>Back in Celina, head coach Elliott contemplates the creeping growth around town with a wary eye.</p> <p>Bobcat Stadium, which dates to the 1930s, got a remodel in 2004 when capacity was doubled to 3,800 and the turf field was put in. But the prospect of the growth putting the intimate Friday night experience of yore on borrowed time lingers.</p> <p>\u201cOne of my big goals is to maintain the culture and tradition that Celina has,\u201d says Elliott. \u201cBecause Celina is one of the last few places around the metroplex that really is a true Friday Night Lights-type feeling. The whole town shuts down. The stadium is packed out and people are standing around the edges several people deep. It\u2019s a special place to play football and I\u2019d hate to lose that some day. Whenever we do build a new stadium that\u2019s something I want to build into it \u2013 that same feeling we have here at Bobcat field.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>Once a week, troubled children in Plymouth battling emotional problems can slip out of lessons and speak to a mental health professional \u2013 at their own school.</p> <p>Teams of mental health staff started working across 27 secondary schools in September as part of an early-intervention scheme aimed at supporting city youngsters when they need help. Backed up by counsellors, the teams offer a wide-ranging package of support including talking therapies and play therapy.</p> <p>The \u00a31.2m project, one of the first of its kind, comes at a time of growing concern over children\u2019s mental health. Figures revealed last month by the Guardian showed that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/oct/03/quarter-of-a-million-children-receiving-mental-health-care-in-england\">almost 250,000 under-19s in England are receiving NHS mental health care</a>. The Plymouth scheme aims to build resilience in youngsters before problems escalate.</p> <p>The scheme stems from a partnership between schools, the city council and the local NHS, in the form of child and adolescent mental health services and the Northern, Eastern and Western Devon clinical commissioning group (CCG). They have pooled their budgets to co-commission the schools service from a range of providers.</p> <p>Developed in consultation with young people and parents, the initiative is the latest product of a quiet revolution in Plymouth that is integrating a range of services with the aim of improving the local population\u2019s health and wellbeing.</p> <p>In April last year, the council and CCG set up an integrated finance system for wellbeing, covering a large range of services including not just health and social care, but also leisure, housing and education. It was a radical move by the city\u2019s debt-laden health and care system and, as its leaders say, one that benefitted from flying \u201cunder the radar\u201d of central government: by not being part of any national integration programmes, the city agencies can follow their ambitions in their own way and at their own pace.</p> <p>What distinguishes Plymouth\u2019s integration journey are the barriers that have been faced and overcome. The CCG is not \u201cco-terminous\u201d with the council \u2013 in other words, it has different boundaries \u2013 and it has been in severe financial distress, with one of the worst records for hospital discharge in the country. The council, meanwhile, has undergone political upheaval \u2013 Labour lost control last year to a Conservative/Ukip alliance.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/social-care-network/2016/nov/01/the-three-conversations-model-turning-away-from-long-term-care\">The 'three conversations' model: turning away from long-term care</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Yet demand for services is soaring \u2013 the city\u2019s population of 261,000 is expected to pass 300,000 by 2031 \u2013 and it was a determination to find new ways of working that prompted the setting up of the cradle-to-grave, integrated fund, as well as the creation of Livewell South West, an integrated community health and adult social care provider.</p> <p>The result has been significant and encouraging improvements in services in the first year, with joint and co-located teams carrying out single assessments of people\u2019s needs and a reduction in hospital stays. However, the ambitions go much further.</p> <p>\u201cPlymouth has been in Torbay\u2019s shadow for too long,\u201d says Gerry Clough, chief operating officer at the CCG, referring to neighbouring Torbay\u2019s reputation for integrating health and social care. \u201cThere was a feeling we wanted to do something on integration. We have adopted the slogan \u2018one system, one budget\u2019 \u2013 the right care, at the right time at the right place.</p> <p>\u201cWhat is distinct about Plymouth is that we started a programme of integration of health and wellbeing and didn\u2019t want to limit it. We have widened it as much as possible.</p> <p>\u201cWe are not a \u2018pioneer\u2019 or \u2018vanguard\u2019, which means we have been off the radar. This has allowed us to retain local control and ambition and meant we have had nobody measuring what we are doing and nobody to report to.\u201d</p> <p>By pooling resources, the council and the CCG created a net integrated fund of \u00a3483m \u2013 cash that could be spent on four aims: improving health and wellbeing outcomes; reducing health inequalities; improving people\u2019s experience of care; and improving the sustainability of health and wellbeing. This meant setting up an integrated commissioning board and creating Livewell South West, which, in turn, necessitated the transfer of more than 170 council staff.</p> <p>In the first 12 months, services were changed dramatically, as money was directed into new models of care and support. The city\u2019s urgent-care system was transformed (see below) and new initiatives were launched to support people with chronic illnesses, avoid unnecessary hospital admissions and help them continue living independently for as long as possible. Dementia diagnoses rose 12% and dementia-friendly services were opened across the city.</p> <p>A special \u201cplace of safety\u201d was set up for vulnerable adults and children who would previously have ended up in custody, while an \u201cearly-help gateway\u201d for children and young people brought quicker assessment of need.</p> <p>With integration entering its second year, change continues apace. Following the launch of mental health support in Plymouth\u2019s schools, there are now plans to reduce the number of children in care by offering more early help to families.</p> <p>However, there is a recognition that effective change doesn\u2019t happen overnight. Carol Burgoyne, the council\u2019s strategic director for people, says: \u201cIt really takes time to change the way of doing things. We are tackling some really challenging topics \u2013 like how we deliver emotional and health wellbeing of young people. It is important to get things right, which can take extra time, and involves the co-design of services.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/social-care-network/2016/nov/02/children-with-positive-care-experience-outperform-at-school\">Children with positive care experience outperform at school</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThe fact that we delivered an integrated budget in our first year is incredible and is thanks to the sheer commitment of staff.

Yet he says that the journey is only just beginning.</p> <p>\u201cHospital discharge procedures have shown a steady improvement, with the area going from having one of the worst records for delayed discharge to just below average. This has been achieved without extra funding, but through recycling money and creating integrated discharge teams.</p> <p>\u201cThere is still more to be done, but there is a huge amount of creative thinking. What has happened has been remarkable. I have spent most of my life talking about meeting short-term targets.

Staffed by a multi-disciplinary health and social care team, the GP-led unit offers a range of onsite investigations, from X-rays to full blood screening, as well as intravenous rehydration, oxygen therapy and access to mobility equipment and aids for daily living. </p> <p>With eight beds, eight treatment chairs and high- and low-observation areas, the clinic \u2013 set up on the principle of \u201ckeeping care closer to home\u201d \u2013 is open seven days a week and can offer treatment for up to 72 hours.</p> <p>It is just one of a number of Livewell South West urgent care services aimed at supporting people with acute conditions to stay in their own homes and prevent inappropriate emergency hospital admissions. Other services include a community crisis response team - a multi-disciplinary squad that offers access to physiotherapy, occupational therapy and social work to people in their own homes \u2013 and an acute care team, which carries out tests and medical investigations for diagnosis in the home and can provide intravenous therapy.</p> <p>For patients such as Willis, who has a recent history of falls and walks with a frame, the Robin hub offers a calm and reassuring environment. Many of its patients are old and may, like her, be seen after a fall. </p> <p>As if to prove that the hub is not about diverting people from hospital at all costs, it emerges that Willis does need hospital treatment \u2013 but for a skin infection, not the fall \u2013 and she is admitted to Derriford hospital, where she stays for a fortnight before being discharged to Mount Gould district hospital for rehabilitation. </p> <p>Now back in her bungalow in Plympton, where she has lived on her own for five years, Willis has nothing but praise for the care she received. \u201cWhat happened was a bit of a shock, but all the staff at Robin were very helpful,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was very relaxing. People from the home recovery team are now coming in to see how I am doing. I am hoping that with some physio I can get back to walking with two sticks.\u201d </p>",
  "<p>Spanish parents are revolting \u2013<a href=\"https://www.thelocal.es/20160923/spanish-parents-to-go-on-strike-over-too-much-homework\"> against homework</a>. The <a href=\"https://www.ceapa.es/\">CEAPA</a> (which represents 12,000 parent/teacher organisations) is organising protests against what it claims is too much homework set by schools. A recent survey revealed that 82% of parents asked believed it was too much or excessive. Over half thought it harmed family life. And with a few caveats, I couldn\u2019t agree more with their complaint.</p> <p>Interestingly, compared with other countries, the <em>estudiantes</em> have it relatively easy. In 2014, the OECD <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?hl=en-GB&amp;q=http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/education/does-homework-perpetuate-inequities-in-education_5jxrhqhtx2xt-en;jsessionid%3Dhjxarhpuvlpj.x-oecd-live-02&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1478191236150000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGO1pOD064FyvUeDn-Fqeqf0x7i4w\">recorded</a> average weekly homework assigned to 15-year-old students across various countries, and it turns out Spanish students don\u2019t know how lucky they are, with a mere 6.5 hours. Finnish pupils dodge the bullet with a skinny 2.8 hours. Shanghai clobbers its students with 13.8 hours (so they know what it feels like to be a teacher, I imagine). The UK doles out a comparatively palatable 4.9 hours. Given that <a href=\"http://www.oecd.org/pisa/\">Programme for International Student Assessment</a> chart-toppers Finland and Shanghai appear at either end of this survey, there doesn\u2019t appear to be a clear link between length of homework set and systemic grade outcomes.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/09/theresa-may-grammar-school-selection-middle-class\">Theresa May\u2019s grammar school nostalgia is heartfelt - but wrong | Jonathan Freedland</a> </p> </aside>  <p>So what does the research say about it? A 2001 <a href=\"https://www.nfer.ac.uk/publications/HWK01/HWK01.pdf\">meta-study</a> by the National Foundation for Educational Research concluded that there was \u201ca positive relationship between time spent and outcomes at secondary level\u201d but \u201cevidence at primary level is inconsistent\u201d. And even at secondary, homework \u201cexplains only a small amount of variance in pupils\u2019 achievement\u201d. More recently John Hattie\u2019s seminal <a href=\"https://headguruteacher.com/2012/10/21/homework-what-does-the-hattie-research-actually-say/\">Visible Learning study</a> concluded that homework overall had an effect size of 0.29 \u2013 in other words, a very small impact. He too noted a difference between the effect on young pupils (0.15, minuscule) and older children (0.64, significant). Other studies <a href=\"http://classtap.pbworks.com/f/Does+Homework+Improve+Achievement.pdf\">concur</a>. So if there is at least some utility, are the Spanish parents right to rebel?</p> <p>Si. Because there is a huge variance between the effect different types of homework have on students. And homework differs from classwork in many ways. It\u2019s normally done independently of supervision; it requires that the task is understood, and that all resources to complete the task (from IT to prior, understood knowledge) are availableThe student needs uninterrupted time and space to finish it, and the qualities of character to complete it. Obviously, mileage varies enormously in all of these categories. In a classroom you can attempt to create a controlled environment where conditions are optimised for everyone\u2019s benefit. But setting homework is an act of faith about what will return; a boomerang thrown into the darkness.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1cd0a207cad2b2d9766f76d8881ecae19c30c16e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1cd0a207cad2b2d9766f76d8881ecae19c30c16e/0_117_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Girl doing homework\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Homework by candlelight in San Cristobal, Venezuela.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Carlos Eduardo Ramirez/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Plus, some homework is useful, and some is not. One thing that amazed me when I entered teaching was how much homework appeared to be entirely mad, and set for little purpose beyond bureaucracy. Writing a poem about how you felt about litter was one of my favourites, but there were countless other examples. Writing a letter from Jesus about what it was like to be on the cross. Making \u201cwanted\u201d posters for Mr Hyde for English teachers. Colouring in the Great Fire of London for history. Writing scripts for roleplays about Greek medicine. Building volcanoes out of papier mache for geography. I mean, come on. These kind of activities indicate a purposelessness that we need to say goodbye to for ever in teaching. Set meaningful homework, or not at all. It\u2019s their time you\u2019re wasting.</p> <p>For example, asking pupils to read independently is great, and useful at most ages, although by itself it won\u2019t help someone struggling with the basics. It demonstrates what is called the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_effect\">Matthew effect</a>: to those that already have, shall be given. In other words it\u2019s the children with poor background knowledge or difficult home environments who benefit least from it, and the most fortunate who get any effect at all. Which isn\u2019t an argument against homework, but a reminder that when you set it, you have to be aware of the different impacts it can have.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/nov/03/my-son-works-until-midnight-parents-around-the-world-on-homework\">'My son works until midnight': parents around the world on homework</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Of course the teacher\u2019s lens is important here too: homework produces marking. And if you set it, the student deserves constructive feedback. But if you see 200+ children as a secondary humanities teacher every week, weekly marking becomes a Sisyphean task. Even flicking and ticking the toils of that number of pupils becomes an extra day out of your week. And the effect of such minimal feedback is microscopic at best. Given that this might burn anything up to 25% of your notional working life, it\u2019s heart-breaking, not to mention pointless.</p> <p>Finally, the parents\u2019 view: homework steals family time that doesn\u2019t get refunded elsewhere in the week. And that is indisputably true, and the theft is compounded when the return is so small in general. Those few hours between getting home and closing your eyes are precious to the inter-family relationship. If you\u2019re going to steal any of that, you better be damn sure that the reward is greater than the loss. And for a lot of homework, for a lot of children, it just doesn\u2019t add up. <em>Abajo el sistema opresor</em> \u2013 down with the oppressor \u2013 as they say in Spain.</p>",

It\u2019s like a game of Soldier of frigging Fortune, complete with metal-guitar solo, one of the most chilling moments in a chilling film.</p> <p>Possibly even worse is Rankin explaining that what normally happens in these cases is that you get three weeks of administrative leave while they investigate the incident, then you return to work and get a medal for a valorous act if that is appropriate, which it usually is. \u201cThree weeks and a medal,\u201d he says with a little smile.

On a subsequent trip to New York, I saw it everywhere there, too. Cacio e pepe has fully entered the collective psyche of foodies. It is part of the restaurant zeitgeist. It has become a trend.\u201d</p> <p>Trendy for good reason: beautiful in its three-ingredient simplicity, cheap and quick to put together \u2013 but very easy to get wrong. As<a href=\"https://racheleats.wordpress.com/2014/11/26/best-shown/\"> Rachel Roddy notes</a>, there is a fine line between clump and cream, and making a smooth sauce from dry cheese and water is a skill that needs to be learned, as I realised on my first, second and seventh attempts. Once you\u2019ve mastered it, however,<em> </em>cacio e pepe is a dish for life; one that can be knocked up in minutes with the most basic of store cupboard ingredients.

Tonnarelli is great if you can find it (spaghetti alla chitarra is similar, and slightly more widely available in the UK), but for the common or garden non-Roman, spaghetti will do just fine. Although the flavour works, I don\u2019t find the wholemeal sort smooth enough for this particular dish, and testers agree they prefer the more robust texture of dry pasta with such strong flavours.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.seriouseats.com/2016/02/spaghetti-cacio-e-pepe-roman-snack-pasta.html\">J Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt of the website Serious Eats</a> breaks with ancient tradition by cooking the pasta in the bare minimum of water in order to concentrate the starch which, in this case, will help to thicken the sauce. Though I might be smitten by Jupiter himself for such heresy, the theory makes sense \u2013 and, as long as you stir the noodles occasionally during cooking, they don\u2019t seem to suffer for lack of space.</p> <h2>The pepper</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cab6b3ec16264b5df2ba3f5e0a380c45f8101d13\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cab6b3ec16264b5df2ba3f5e0a380c45f8101d13/0_0_3024_1814/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rachel Roddy\u2019s cacio e pepe.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rachel Roddy\u2019s cacio e pepe.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Again, as with carbonara, this should be added in quantity \u2013 Roddy toasts the peppercorns before crushing, which brings out their flavour beautifully.

L\u00f3pez-Alt is not alone in combining sauce and spaghetti in a cool pan, as opposed to that the pasta was cooked in, in order to control the temperature better, although unless you\u2019re very slow, you shouldn\u2019t need to reheat it afterwards, as he suggests.</p> <p>Katie Parla and Kristina Gill, authors of Tasting Rome, who <a href=\"http://www.splendidtable.org/recipes/leonardo-vignoli-s-cacio-e-pepe\">share a recipe</a> from chef Leonardo Vignoli, whisk the cheese and water together to make a paste before adding the pasta, as do Baccanelli and Barreca, while Roddy and Boswell both prefer to stir in the noodles and cheese at the same time. This latter method seems fraught with danger for the amateur; I\u2019m definitely not co-ordinated enough to vigorously beat pasta with one hand while adding cheese with the other, so the staggered approach works better for me.</p> <p>Perhaps the most helpful advice I read on the subject is Roddy\u2019s admission: \u201cWith dishes like this, it is all about practice, about trying, possibly failing and trying again in order to discover how much pasta, cooking water, how much cheese and pepper, how vigorous is vigorous. In short, finding your way of doing things.\u201d How saucy you want it, how peppery, how bouncy the pasta, how sharp the cheese.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Fortunately, it\u2019s a happy subject for experimentation; even my worst failures were wolfed down. Cheese, pasta and pepper; really, it\u2019s hard to go wrong.</p> <h2>Perfect cacio e pepe</h2> <p><strong><em>(Serves 2)</em><br></strong><strong>2 tsp black peppercorns<br></strong><strong>200g spaghetti (or pici, or tonarelli, if you can find them)<br></strong><strong>80g pecorino romano, at room temperature, finely grated</strong></p> <p>Toast the peppercorns in a very hot, dry pan until fragrant, then roughly crush.</p> <p>Bring a wide shallow pan of well-salted water to the boil, then add the pasta; it should be covered but not by much. Stir occasionally during cooking and, five minutes into the cooking time, scoop out 250ml water into a wide bowl to allow it to cool slightly.</p> <p>Drain the pasta and leave it to cool for a minute. Meanwhile, put the cheese and most of the pepper in a large, heavy bowl or pan and beat in some of the pasta water very gradually to make first a paste, and then a sauce the consistency of bechamel. Add the pasta and toss furiously while adding enough of the water (you shouldn\u2019t need it all) to make a sauce that coats each strand. Don\u2019t worry if it takes a while to come together \u2013 keep beating and it should happen. </p> <p>Divide between warm bowls, sprinkle over a little more pepper, and serve immediately.</p> <p><strong>Cacio e pepe: old favourite, new love or hipster fad?

At the time it was called the Bert Kelly Research Centre, where there were some ultra-conservative outfits as tenants, including Cory Bernardi\u2019s Conservative Leadership Foundation, the Samuel Griffith Society (dedicated to upholding the constitution!), the Australian Taxpayers\u2019 Alliance and Menzies House, plus Family First. Books by the likes of David Flint and Ian Plimer were launched from the Fullarton Road property.</p> <p>Bert Kelly, a free trade Liberal member of parliament from 1958 to 1977 and the original author of the Financial Review\u2019s Modest Member column, would be turning in his grave if he knew what was being carried on in his name. </p> <p>It was from here in 2010 that Day set about rebuilding Family First, which at that stage looked like the political arm of the Assemblies of God parishioners in Adelaide. His aim was to remodel the party along the same organisational lines as his Homestead Homes business \u2013 ie, Builder Bob in charge of everything, which might have something to do with the current mess.</p> <p>There were other hairy issues in the party\u2019s post-Steve Fielding era, with attempted preference deals between Family First and the Australian Sex party, and tweets from a Queensland Family First member <a href=\"http://m.theage.com.au/federal-election/sex-debt-and-heads-that-roll-a-family-saga-of-biblical-proportions-20100814-12489.html\">equating gay marriage to \u201clegalising child abuse\u201d. </a></p> <p>The party had racked up $200,000 in debts, including money owned to members of Family First\u2019s executive committee. Up to that point the party\u2019s main financial backer was Peter Harris, <a href=\"http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/business/sa-business-journal/west-lakes-apartment-developer-falls-into-receivership-with-877-million-debts/story-e6fredel-1225997522890\">whose building development companies went into liquidation</a> in 2010-11.</p> <p>The dangers of Family First depending on property developers was a lesson that should have been learned in 2010, which proves once again that the godly are not possessed of special insights. While Day has been comfortably warming a Senate seat the customers of companies he controls have been complaining about shoddy workmanship and semi-completed homes.</p> <p>Day says he would \u201crelish the opportunity to get to the high court\u201d and is clinging to Garfield Barwick\u2019s 1975 interpretation in Webster\u2019s case of <a href=\"http://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Senate/Powers_practice_n_procedures/~/link.aspx?_id=074367F0015D42C2B005207F5642376A&amp;_z=z#chapter-01_part-04_44\">s.44(v) of the constitution. </a></p> <p>As he was fond of doing with the Tax Act, Barwick constructed the constitutional protection so narrowly as to make it useless. He found that a family company of Senator James Webster (Nat. Vic), which had been contracted to supply timber to the government was not in breach of section 44(v) because they were not standing contracts, rather arrangements to supply from time to time.</p> <p>This seems to fly in the face of the <a href=\"http://www.aec.gov.au/about_aec/Publications/Backgrounders/s44-constitution.htm\">purpose of the parliamentary eligibility provision of the constitution</a> which is designed to disqualify candidates whose conflicts of loyalty risk affecting their performance. </p> <p>Day was actually in the <a href=\"https://jade.io/article/475980\">high court this year</a> in a doomed challenge to the new Senate voting amendments. It led the then solicitor general, Justin Gleeson, to remark to Chief Justice Robert French that Day\u2019s challenge to the law effectively was also a challenge to the process by which he was elected to the Senate in 2013. <a href=\"http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/other/HCATrans/2016/73.html  http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/other/HCATrans/2016/73.html  http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/other/HCATrans/2016/73.html\">Here\u2019s Gleeson in March 2016</a> at a preliminary round in the high court: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>They [the submissions] have the rather startling proposition that Senator Day is, in fact, not Senator Day, he is Mr Day. He has been sitting invalidly in the Senate for the last three years. No legislation has validly been passed by the Senate. Now, why \u2013 I will call him Senator Day \u2013 would leave it until, as it were, five minutes to midnight before this election to bring before this court three arguments which impugn his own position as a senator has been left totally unexplained.</p> </blockquote> <p>To press the point, the chief justice asked Day\u2019s counsel, Peter King: \u201cBut do you accept that you are challenging the validity of a process of voting in Senate elections which has been in place for many years, long before the current amendment?\u201d</p> <p>In other words, the solicitor general and the chief justice were of the view at that point that the logical extension of Day\u2019s argument was that he was ineligible to sit from the moment he was elected in September 2013. These are not the same grounds for ineligibility that are now in contention, but nonetheless show that Day had long been confused about his entitlement to sit as a senator. </p> <p>As for Rod Culleton, if he does appear in the high court it promises to be memorable. <a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-opinion/decoding-15-quotes-from-one-nation-senator-rod-culletons-hilarious-press-conference-20161102-gsgjee.html\">He told the media yesterday</a> in the hokey, blokey, bush-wacking tone of One Nation: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I\u2019m not sure whether I\u2019m gonna participate in any high court jurisdiction and if I do I\u2019ll simply go down, shear a sheep and take the belly fleece and stick it over my head and represent myself, because I\u2019m a true Australian standing up for the Australian people.</p> </blockquote> <p>Oi, oi, oi. </p>",
  "<p>When I worked as an adviser to the Afghanistan government, even the smallest of infrastructure projects became politicised and overshadowed by corruption. <br></p> <p>When the ministry wanted to provide clean water to villagers, it was sometimes only possible if private companies belonging to local power brokers \u2013 usually MPs, district administrators or police chiefs \u2013 were given the construction contracts. If they didn\u2019t win the bid, they would take their share through extortion. Sometimes, the ministry\u2019s facilitating partners lost their machinery, or found them on fire while working on our road projects because they hadn\u2019t paid a bribe to the armed groups that controlled the project area. </p> <p>My ministry, the ministry of rural development, was the most important arm of government. We were involved in nearly 35,000 of the roughly 40,000 villages across the country. In the process, we provided around 70% of Afghans with vital infrastructure, such as midwife clinics, schools, waterworks, bridges, roads, women\u2019s training centres, or solar power projects. This was genuinely important work for genuinely needy people \u2013 and yet it was often disrupted by the corruption of the political class, who would, one way or another, find a way of getting their hands on the money. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d9c2f164649feb99fd4a15d6e3deca958c5215dc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d9c2f164649feb99fd4a15d6e3deca958c5215dc/0_0_5616_3744/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A Kyrgyz man installs solar panels that charge car batteries to provide electricity, mainly for light bulbs and radios, Wakhan, Afghanistan.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Kyrgyz man installs solar panels that charge car batteries to provide electricity, mainly for light bulbs and radios, Wakhan, Afghanistan.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matthieu Paley/Getty Images/National Geographic Magazines</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And where was the money was coming from? It came from the pockets of the taxpayers in EU, UK, US, Canada, and Australia.</p> <p>I have since left Afghanistan, but I was recently reminded of my former life when European leaders gathered in Brussels to give $3bn (\u00a32.45bn) to Afghanistan. The UK alone announced \u00a3750m in aid for the coming three years. As a former government official, and a former UN staffer in Afghanistan, I have concerns about how this money will be spent. What safeguards are in place to ensure that the money benefits Afghans? Will a farmer in a remote village benefit from these donations after they seep through various corrupted layers of government? Will it help a deported asylum seeker to build a new life? I worry that Europe has given the Afghan government a blank cheque.</p> <p>The current political elite in Afghanistan took power 15 years ago after international coalition forces toppled the Taliban regime. Since then, the world has poured hundreds of billions of dollars to Afghanistan. Most of what was pledged was meant to bring peace, stability, build and rebuild institutions that would work for all Afghans after so many years of wars and devastation. Instead, much of that money has been wasted. You could even argue that the dangers posed by Isis and the Taliban, who now control more land than at any point since the <a>2001 western</a> intervention, are ultimately less damaging than the country\u2019s corruption.</p> <p>Afghanistan was ranked 166 out of 168 countries on <a href=\"http://www.transparency.org/cpi2015\">Transparency International\u2019s corruption perception 2015 index</a>. Government has often become a self-serving means of enriching the political class. Several politicians have built up business empires that overshadow any attempts to bring about positive change to people\u2019s lives. The political elites have ethnocentric agendas, exacerbate tribal rivalries and political intolerance, erode political will, and increase impunity for the powerful.</p> <p>The donor community has allowed this dynamic to emerge. Donors do highlight Afghanistan\u2019s corruption epidemic. But they never link their aid to any kind of genuinely effective scrutiny, and as result they have ultimately failed to hold the Afghan government to account for how they spend the donors\u2019 money.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jun/16/kabul-bank-afghanistan-financial-scandal\">Kabul Bank scandal </a>was an obvious example. It saw $850m (\u00a3700m) lost to fraud at Afghanistan\u2019s biggest bank, and was described by US officials as \u201cthe biggest per capita fraud in history\u201d. The bank\u2019s shareholders were mostly from the country\u2019s political elite, and included cabinet ministers, MPs, and warlords. The bank\u2019s executives spent $160m (\u00a3130m) alone on 35 luxury villas in Dubai, many of which were registered in the names of shareholders. But those to blame for this massive money laundering have ultimately proved untouchable. Khalilullah Ferozi, the former executive of the bank, was <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-21666689\">sentenced</a> to five years in prison. But last year he was released in order to sign a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/05/afghan-government-signs-huge-property-deal-shamed-ex-banker\">multimillion property deal</a> with the Afghan government. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c59ff97997291c7a927f7d2fc04b65d906f22784\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c59ff97997291c7a927f7d2fc04b65d906f22784/0_0_3381_2476/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An Afghan man prepares tea for refugees displaced by Kunduz fighting between Afghan forces and Taliban insurgents, at a makeshift camp in the outskirts of Kabul.

Since corruption goes unpunished Afghans feel betrayed by their leaders, and insurgents have fed off this disappointment.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Shah Marai/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This kind of corruption indirectly exacerbates Afghanistan\u2019s conflict. Since corruption consistently goes unpunished, Afghans feel betrayed by their leaders \u2013 and insurgents have in turn fed off this widespread sense of disappointment. The enemy sees a vacuum to fill. Just last week, Taliban insurgents attacked Kunduz \u2013 the last stronghold lost by the Taliban in 2001. This is the second time in two months that the Taliban have attacked Kunduz \u2013 they first briefly seized it last August.</p> <p>Despite all this, Europe\u2019s aid is only conditional on Afghanistan agreeing to re-admit all refugees deported from Europe. This is a condition that will do nothing to stop corruption, and do everything to endanger ordinary Afghans, who will be sent back to a war zone. According to the recent <a href=\"http://unama.unmissions.org/afghanistan-record-level-civilian-casualties-sustained-first-half-2016-un-report\">United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan</a> report on Afghanistan, 5,166 civilians were killed during just the first six months of this year. And between 2009 and June 2016, civilian casualties reached 63,934. Another report shows that half of Afghanistan\u2019s territory experiences war and violence on a daily basis.</p> <p>So shouldn\u2019t Europe\u2019s aid be conditional on something other than deportations? The money will definitely be wasted unless donor countries encourage the Afghan government to implement a real anti-corruption strategy that is supported by law. It must be conditional on fighting corruption \u2013 and the Afghan government should also show the political will to end impunity for corrupt officials. In order to create an effective and transparent government in Kabul, the donors who pledge their taxpayers\u2019 money should draw specific red lines for spending this pledged money.

  "<p>It\u2019s traditional in November to write about the gender pay gap \u2013 I\u2019ve spent the past three years doing just that. But this year, when I set out to discover whether women in tech are earning considerably less than their male peers, I was struck by something else. New research from US survey salary company Paysa shows that the first hurdle the tech world needs to overcome isn\u2019t paying women fairly, it\u2019s getting them into the company in the first place. </p> <p>Paysa <a href=\"https://www.paysa.com/blog/2016/08/29/alls-fair-in-tech-and-money/\">reviewed the pay of 1,143 job roles</a> at 63 companies, a number that should have given it enough data to review the gender pay gap. However, of those 1,143 roles only 50 had close to an equal number of men and women doing them and, unsurprisingly, these jobs were in areas such as HR or administration. When all job roles were taken into consideration, women made up just 26% of the tech industry. So before companies can begin to analyse whether or not they are paid fairly, they have to ask themselves why they are finding it so hard to get women through the door in the first place.<br></p> <p>The standard response is that it\u2019s not the hiring companies\u2019 fault. They pass the blame on to universities: if more women took computer science degrees there would be more women in tech. Universities pass the blame on to schools: not enough girls take Stem (science, technology, engineering and maths) subjects. And schools pass the blame on to parents and society: more girls would take Stem subjects if only their parents would stop buying them dolls for Christmas and advertising agencies didn\u2019t assume all scientists were male.<br></p> <p>The truth is we\u2019re all to blame for the lack of girls leaving school with a desire to work in the technology industry, but the industry could certainly do more to help. As Meta Brown puts it in a <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/metabrown/#79345ebe5d5d\">column for Forbes</a>, the tech industry has got worse at bringing women into the fold. In the 1960s, nobody left university able to code. Those courses didn\u2019t exist, so tech companies would hire smart people and train them. They invested in their staff from the get-go. Since there was no need to have a particular background to get into the industry, it attracted a wider range of people, not just in terms of gender but also backgrounds, interests and experiences. Today, it\u2019s the same people from the same universities who have done the same degrees.<br></p> <p>This bland recruitment strategy isn\u2019t just bad for gender diversity, it\u2019s bad for innovation. When you have a group of people whose life experiences all echo each other\u2019s, you run the risk of them designing products exclusively for themselves and others like them. Perhaps if Apple had a slightly more diverse workforce it would have realised that a <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/2015/09/finally-youll-able-track-period-ios/\">period tracker</a> would have made a good part of the health app, or that <a href=\"http://bossip.com/1137485/race-matters-new-apple-watch-malfunctions-on-people-with-dark-skin-but-heres-why/\">testing the iWatch on different skin colours</a> before it launched might have been a good idea.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/sep/08/code-like-a-girl-if-you-can-learn-to-read-music-you-can-learn-to-program\">Code like a girl: if you can learn to read music, you can learn to program</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Claiming that there aren\u2019t enough women in tech because there aren\u2019t enough of them taking computer science degrees is just laziness on the behalf of companies. We know that the number of women taking these degrees is falling as they are turned off by the idea of becoming developers.</p> <p> And it\u2019s not got anything to do with the job itself. It\u2019s a problem that stems from a lack of role models, a culture that\u2019s more boys\u2019 club than gender equality and a lack of interest in innovative hiring from the top of the organisation. If you want more women to have \u201cdeveloper\u201d at the top of their career choices as they finish their A-levels, then everyone in the tech industry needs to make it a more female-friendly career.<br></p> <p>Nearly every week I\u2019m sent a press release about a new scheme that has been set up to get more women into tech. There are clubs that target young girls and bring role models into school. There are programmes that retrain stay-at-home mothers, helping them get back into the workplace. And there are numerous groups, networks and roundtables that try to support women already working in the industry. The key point of all these is that they are started and run by women. Occasionally, a few men will turn up to events or step forward to champion a programme that a woman in their organisation has thought up, but they are in the minority and their impact is minimal.<br></p> <p>Getting more women into technology faces the same problem that getting equal pay through every industry does: men are scared that it will negatively impact them so they fail to support it. Instead, they behave as all scared humans do and protect their own, whether that\u2019s people of the same gender, or those who went to the same university or who like the same pizza. What nobody talks about is that paying women more hasn\u2019t resulted in men being paid less. There is room for everybody, whether they look like you or not. We just have to open the doors.<br></p> <p><strong>Looking for a job?

  "<p>Ever wondered what your favourite beer sounds like?

In 2014, he published an abstract arguing that <a href=\"http://flavourjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/2044-7248-4-3\" rel=\"nofollow\">sound is the forgotten flavour sense</a>. In this he mentions several studies that show the connection, such as one in which crispier bacon was rated tastier by participants and another in which crunchier crisps were seen as fresher.</p> <p>Spence says that food and drinks businesses could use the connection between sound and taste to their advantage. They could, for example, play high music to bring out sweet tastes and low music to emphasise sour tastes.<br></p> <p>Jesse Dunford Wood, owner of <a href=\"http://parlourkensal.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Parlour</a> restaurant in Kensal Green, London, created a theatrical dining experience, partly inspired by Spence\u2019s research. At each of Dunford Wood\u2019s <a href=\"https://trulyexperiences.com/uk/chefs-table-at-parlour.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Chef\u2019s Table</a> events , which he runs every Tuesday to Sunday evening at Parlour, he serves six guests 10 or more seasonal meals. Then comes the musical finale: for the last course, each guest is fitted with wireless headphones while Dunford Wood constructs an elaborate 20 piece dessert in front of them.<br></p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s like a silent disco,\u201d says Dunford Wood. \u201cMusic is very carefully considered in order to enhance the taste experience.\u201d Wood begins by squirting sauces on to a long strip of foil that acts as a communal substitute for plates, while guests listen to classical music including Rimsky-Korsakov\u2019s Flight of the Bumblebee and Strauss\u2019s<em> </em>Also Sprach Zarathustra, used in the film 2001: A Space Odyssey.<br></p> <p>The playlist then moves on to well-known hits, chosen to fit with the ingredients being used, for example, Dunford Wood times a spoonful of sugar to land in front of the guests while Julie Andrews\u2019s classic hit is played. \u201cIt\u2019s a journey of music playing on different emotions to build suspense,\u201d he says. While Gene Wilder sings Pure Imagination smoke rises around the puddings.<br></p> <p>Parlour has 30 staff, but Dunford Wood tries to do most of the serving himself at the Chef\u2019s Table. This gives him the chance to get to know who he\u2019s serving. He sometimes tailors the music to suit different groups of customers as he learns more about them.<br></p> <p>Once Dunford Wood has finished, the headphone\u2019s are taken away from the guests. By this point the playlist should have built anticipation for what they are about to eat. \u201cIt\u2019s a performance,\u201d he explains.<br></p> <p>At the <a href=\"http://edinburghbeerfactory.co.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Edinburgh Beer Factory</a>, a brewer with a cafe-bar that also offers brewery tours, music is essential to brand identity. The business\u2019s name is a nod to Manchester\u2019s Factory Records, which released albums by bands such as Joy Division and New Order. Music videos from these artists are played in the cafe-bar.<br></p> <p>Kirsty Dunsmore, co-founder, says: \u201cWe\u2019re trying to get people to rethink lager [the Factory\u2019s main product]; see it as more stylish. We\u2019ve found its visual representation and musical context can help reframe that and make the customer enjoy it more.\u201d One artist whose music Dunsmore thinks goes really well with the beer is David Bowie. \u201cWe see ourselves as embracing the best elements from the old and new, big and small brewing. David Bowie is in that mould.

The temple was held under siege and the couple who were due to marry were forced to cancel their nuptials. <br></p> <p> Among those trying to keep the peace that day was the 79-year-old Green party councillor Janet Alty, who was questioned under caution for allegedly calling one protester a terrorist. No further action was taken against Alty. Those who run the temple say protests have become an unfortunate recurrence during the wedding season.</p> <p> Eventually the disrupted wedding did take place under a shroud of secrecy the following Monday, but the protest has sent shockwaves through the close-knit community.<br></p> <p>When an interfaith marriage now takes place, the temple is forced to hire security guards to protect couples and their families. To avoid trouble, some couples are choosing to get married on weekdays, which are less likely to be disrupted.</p> <p>Five weeks after that last protest, the Guardian was invited along to the temple for Friday\u2019s secret wedding.<br></p> <p>The bride is a follower of Jainism, an ancient Indian religion similar to Buddhism, and her groom is a Sikh. The couple do not want to be identified for fear of repercussions.</p> <p>At the temple, volunteers cook sabzi and chapattis in the kitchen, preparing to feed the forty or so people of every faith who will walk through its doors to attend the wedding.<br></p> <p>Upstairs, in one of the prayer rooms, the couple \u2013 both 29-year-old professionals - and their relatives are anxious.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"716f132760e695f1283595ef9e35c0beeca59ae5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/716f132760e695f1283595ef9e35c0beeca59ae5/0_374_5616_3370/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Gurdwara Sahib Leamington Spa &amp; Warwick.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Gurdwara Sahib Leamington Spa &amp; Warwick.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ben Gurr/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p> The bride says she received a phone call that morning and was told her wedding would have to be a day sooner than planned, for her own safety.</p> <p>\u201cWe have been educated here and are moderate and should be free to marry whomever we wish,\u201d she says. \u201cI had to rush up from London \u2013 this is no way to be.

Singh, 77, says because of his moderate outlook he has received repeated threats from the group online and in person and has even had a brick thrown through his window. </p> <p>He was present at the temple on the morning of the protest on 11 September. He said the protesters arrived at the temple at 6.30am, forcing their way past hired security guards into the main atrium. The couple were warned and did not attend. Armed police eventually cleared the protesters, all of whom were arrested on suspicion of aggravated trespass.<br></p> <p> Warwickshire police said no further action would be taken against 50 of the 55 people arrested. A 28-year-old man from Coventry was given a caution for religiously aggravated criminal damage. A 39-year-old from Birmingham and two men aged 33 and 36 from Coventry have been re-bailed until the end of November.<em> </em>No further action was taken against a 31-year-old from Oldbury. </p> <p> The protests had been organised by a group called Sikh Youth UK and were part of an increasingly active youth movement within the community. </p> <p>Deepa Singh, who describes himself as a Sikh Youth UK co-ordinator, said the group had thousands of members including teachers, barristers and accountants. Others estimate membership to be in the low hundreds. <br></p> <p> Another member, Shamsher Singh, previously told the Guardian: \u201cMore and more young people are becoming interested in the true interpretation of what it means to be Sikh.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1f8b0cf797e06d82ff00c604933d89103b09dfc5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1f8b0cf797e06d82ff00c604933d89103b09dfc5/0_349_5585_3349/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The prayer hall at the Gurdwara Sahib temple in Leamington Spa, Warwickshire.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The prayer hall at the Gurdwara Sahib temple in Leamington Spa, Warwickshire.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ben Gurr/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p> \u201cThe elder generation arrived [in the UK] and fitted their faith round the need to assimilate, survive and to get work.

He claims that they have strong links to the Sikh Council, an organisation set up in 2010 to deal with issues affecting the Sikh community in Britain and Europe. The council denies any affiliation with the group, and say they have no involvement in the organisation of protests.</p> <p> Shortly after the Sikh Council was formed, it issued an edict saying weddings between Sikhs and non-Sikhs could not take place in temples, arguing that the Sikh wedding ceremony, Anand Karaj, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-34043575\">should be reserved only for Sikhs</a>.</p> <p> Marrying people of other faiths is acceptable, they say, but conducting that marriage in a Sikh temple is not. Non-Sikhs can only be involved if they accept the Sikh faith and change their name to include Singh or Kaur, the council insists.</p> <p>Around 10 of the estimated 360 Sikh temples in the UK are thought to be affiliated to the council. However, many in the Sikh community are wholly opposed to these rules, saying Sikhism is a faith of acceptance and equality.</p> <p> Mota Singh believes there has been a \u201ccultural change\u201d where young British-born Sikhs are \u201cattracted by fundamentalism \u2026 They stick together and they want their own societies which exclude other groups.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/15/the-guardian-view-on-interfaith-marriage-a-human-right\">The Guardian view on interfaith marriage: a human right | Editorial</a> </p> </aside>  <p> \u201cThey are different to their parents \u2013 the first generation immigrants \u2013 who wanted to integrate.

These guys were far more scary than football hooligans,\u201d he said. \u201cThey were foul-mouthed and intimidating and I have never experienced anything like this.\u201d</p> <p> Other temples across the country have been less robust under pressure from the protests groups and no longer hold interfaith marriages. But the temple committee in Leamington is adamant that they will continue. \u201cOn the face of it what they are protesting is against mixed marriage \u2013 but it is deeper than that,\u201d said the temple trustee Jaswant Singh Virdee. \u201cThey want to control the temple with their own people and with their own extremist views.</p> <p> \u201cIt is seems these protests apply only to England.

  "<h2><strong>Winning tip: Helper, Utah</strong><br></h2> <p>Helper is an old mining town 100 miles or so from Salt Lake City. It had been in decline for years but a steady flow of artists who can\u2019t afford SLC prices are moving in. The old, run-down cinema still displays a poster of the last film shown in the 1960s. Its rich history of immigration and mining, plus its Butch Cassidy links, is reflected in the fascinating contents of its antique shops. The residents were pleased and perplexed to have an English couple turn up in town. We heard stories of the town\u2019s past from a retired actor carrying his three white poodles who had moved in a decade ago from LA. He told of the huge increase in the town\u2019s population when miners came down from the mountains at the weekends, the bars and bordellos doing great business. The town is a sort of living museum and anyone interested in American culture would delight in spending time here, chatting with real characters full of stories and legends. Go before this place disappears.

Airlines are expected to have plans in place to cope with setbacks \u2013 such as bad weather or technical problems \u2013 considered an inherent part of flying. Crew sickness would certainly seem to qualify, as standby staff should be available.</p> <p>Finnair insists its \u201cback-up system is fully able to cover normal levels of absences\u201d, but adds: \u201cDuring the day in question there was an exceptional peak in sickness. We tried to recruit from day offs, but weren\u2019t successful.\u201d</p> <p>The Finnish Consumer Disputes Board, to whom you then turned, agreed the situation was \u201cexceptional\u201d.</p> <p>However, Kevin Clarke of Bott &amp; Co, specialists in aviation law, says: \u201cFinnair is essentially arguing that staff falling ill is not part and parcel of running the airline. This does not stand up to scrutiny; in any industry it is inevitable that employees will fall unexpectedly ill at some point.\u201d</p> <p>It took on your case free of charge and, seven months on, has won \u00a3601 compensation, minus \u00a3122 court fees. This is, of course, is no real compensation for your emotional and financial losses.</p> <p>Even when flight delays do qualify for compensation, airlines are not liable for any consequential losses so always buy comprehensive travel insurance and read the small print.</p> <p>Meanwhile, you will hopefully have lodged a separate claim to the airline for your damaged luggage.</p> <p><strong>If you need help email Anna Tims at </strong><a href=\"mailto:your.problems@observer.co.uk\"><strong>your.problems@observer.co.uk </strong></a><strong>or write to Your Problems, The Observer, Kings Place, 90 York Way, London N1 9GU.

  "<p>An invasive flatworm from Brazil that poses a threat to soil health and wildlife has made its way to mainland Britain.</p> <p>A 4.5cm Obama flatworm (<em>Obama nungara</em>) \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/09/barack-obama-parasitic-flatworm-name-honor\">not linked to the US president</a> but named after the Brazilian Tupi words for leaf (oba) and animal (ma) \u2013 was discovered this summer crawling out of a Heuchera plant imported from the Netherlands at a garden centre in Oxfordshire. </p> <p>Conservationists say this is the \u201csmoking gun\u201d which provides the direct link between the \u201cvirtually uncontrolled\u201d trade in pot plants and the spread of invasive species.</p> <p>The worm, which has a broad, flattened, leaf-shaped body and can grow up to 7cm long, was first found in Europe on Guernsey in 2008 but has spread to France, Italy and Spain. It was only <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obama_nungara#cite_note-AP2014-1\">described as a new species</a> last year. </p> <p>Populations of New Zealand and Australian flatworms are already established in the UK and there are <a href=\"https://peerj.com/articles/430/\">at least 18 flatworms</a> that have been introduced in Europe, including the New Guinea flatworm, listed as one of the <a href=\"http://www.iflscience.com/environment/new-guinea-flatworm-one-worst-known-invasive-species-found-us/\">100 worst invasive alien species</a> in the world.</p> <p>Flatworms prey on earthworms and land snails, and in areas where they have already colonised the soil they have <a href=\"http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10530-012-0309-7\">reduced some earthworm populations by 20%</a>. </p> <p>These invertebrates are considered essential for soil health as they aerate and fertilise the earth, maintain its structure and support plant growth. Fewer invertebrates would also have an impact higher up the food chain, while the resulting poorer quality soil could have knock-on effects on everything from flooding - making the soil less able to absorb water - to farming - where crops would be harder to grow. </p> <p>\u201cThe importation of pot plants into the UK is bringing with it an avalanche of harmful and unwanted species.

The police reaction to the miners\u2019 union picketing was excessive.

There were no deaths at Orgreave. There was violence on both sides. But the arrested miners were tried and acquitted. That some suffered through being bailed is sadly true of thousands of innocent citizens every year.</p> <p>Why does Burnham suddenly want an inquiry into Orgreave? Back in 2005 he was a junior minister at the very Home Office he now wants to put on trial. There was no inquiry then. Could it be that Burnham was part of Tony Blair\u2019s New Labour establishment, eager to forget the taint of Scargillism, whereas <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/09/andy-burnham-selected-labours-candidate-manchester-mayor\" title=\"\">he now wants to be mayor of Manchester</a>?</p> <p>Orgreave was miserable for those involved, but pit closures are history. The miners were victims of that history, as were workers at the same time in dockyards, steel foundries and newspapers. Protest was understandable and probably inevitable. But does Burnham really want to go back to subsidising dirty coal? Public policy \u2013 and resources \u2013 should surely go into helping the stranded, demoralised communities left behind.

The brisk inquiries familiar in the 1950s and 1960s lasted on average three months. By the 1990s this had tripled to 10 months.

Meanwhile, victims\u2019 hopes of compensation are inflated \u2013 and postponed \u2013 as lawyers pump up each line of inquiry and costs soar. Is&#xa0;it really sensible to starve a desperately under-resourced care service for this circus?</p> <p>It seems no longer to matter how long these inquiries take.

Chilcot lost credibility by being absurdly indulgent of Downing Street officials.

A few do, such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/1999/feb/17/guardiansocietysupplement4\" title=\"\">Scarman on riot policing</a>, but most tell us little more than we already know: that public services operate under stress, must take risks and can sometimes fail. Inquiries seldom acknowledge risk, because risk is not a concept known to law.</p> <p>Trial and error is part of the relationship between ministers and officials. It is a trial and error that should be vulnerable to constant scrutiny by parliament, the courts and the media, not delegated to some passing judge. As for the past, there should be some statute of limitation. History is for historians.

  "<p>On 12 May 2014, just after 5.15pm, two well-dressed, middle-aged women walked purposefully up the ramp of a footbridge over the Bernesga river in the historic city of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le%C3%B3n,_Spain\">Le\u00f3n</a> in north-western Spain. First came Isabel Carrasco, the most powerful politician in the city, who was heading to the local headquarters of the conservative People\u2019s party (PP). A minibus was waiting to take her to an election campaign rally with Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy. After numerous corruption scandals, his party was tanking in the polls, and he needed the support of one of his most successful vote-winners. At barely 5ft tall and 59 years old, Carrasco was a bold and colourful dresser. She was wearing a purple jacket with pink cuffs, black Chlo\u00e9 jeans and fuchsia platform shoes.</p> <p>The woman who walked up the gentle arc of the bridge a few metres behind Carrasco was overdressed for a sunny afternoon \u2013 in a designer parka, baseball cap and leather gloves \u2013 but seemed otherwise unremarkable to Pedro Mielgo, a retired police officer who passed them both. Perhaps that is why, when the first shot rang out, he thought it was a firework.</p> <p>When Mielgo looked back, however, he could see Carrasco sprawled on the ground. The other woman was leaning over her, a pistol in her gloved hand. She fired three more shots at Carrasco\u2019s head \u2013 which bounced violently against the ground \u2013 and then turned around. After putting the gun in a shoulder bag, the woman pulled a scarf over her mouth and walked calmly past Mielgo before heading towards the centre of this placid and charming provincial city.</p> <p>The assassin quickly melted into the sluggish afternoon street life of Le\u00f3n, crossing the narrow riverside park and turning into a street of four-storey apartment blocks with shops and bars at ground level. Mielgo followed at a discreet distance, phoning the police as he went. He lost her by the Col\u00f3n market, but then rounded the corner of the Gran V\u00eda de San Marcos and saw a woman who \u2013 although she was now wearing a white jacket \u2013 he thought he recognised as the killer.</p> <p>Mielgo waved down a passing police car. By now, the woman had got into the passenger seat of a parked, silver-grey Mercedes SLK 200 sports car, although there was no one in the driver\u2019s seat. \u201cThat\u2019s her. Be careful, she has a gun,\u201d he shouted. The police officers approached the car and asked the woman for her identity card, which revealed that she was 58-year-old Montserrat Gonz\u00e1lez. Moments later, a younger woman approached them, explaining that she was Gonz\u00e1lez\u2019s 34-year-old daughter, Triana Mart\u00ednez. Triana said her mother had been with her the whole afternoon.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2016/dec/02/the-shocking-of-spains-most-flamboyant-politician-podcast\">The shocking murder of Spain\u2019s most flamboyant politician \u2013 podcast</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A quick search of the car turned up no weapon. The home address on the back of the women\u2019s identity cards was the Plaza de los Marqueses in the hilltop town of Astorga, 30 miles away. That square is best known as home to the city\u2019s police headquarters. The women explained that the police station was their registered home, since Gonz\u00e1lez\u2019s husband, Pablo Mart\u00ednez, was Astorga\u2019s chief of police. Mart\u00ednez was one of the half-dozen most senior officers in Le\u00f3n province. Despite this strange twist, Montserrat and Triana were immediately taken to Le\u00f3n\u2019s main police station for questioning as murder suspects.</p> <p>While Mielgo was following the mysterious killer, Le\u00f3n\u2019s emergency services were dealing with something they had no experience of \u2013 a cold-blooded assassination in the middle of the day in a public place. Carrasco had been shot in the back and, as she slid to the ground, grabbed hold of the bridge\u2019s handrail, twisting to see her attacker. Two more .32 calibre bullets had then been fired into her head, killing her instantly.</p> <p>The victim, who presided over the powerful provincial government, or <em>diputaci\u00f3n</em>, from her office in a cloistered 16th-century bishop\u2019s palace, was known to everyone in Le\u00f3n. The murder had been committed at one of the most dramatic sites in the city. \u201cIt was almost like a ceremonial killing,\u201d recalled \u00c1ngela Dom\u00ednguez, the former editor of the local edition of El Mundo newspaper. Emergency service radio recordings reveal one shocked ambulanceman blurting out a phrase that many would have recognised: \u201cShe\u2019s the one who had 12 jobs, and 12 salaries!\u201d It was a reference to the number of official and semi-official posts Carrasco had accumulated during her five years as <em>diputaci\u00f3n </em>president. With her multiple jobs, incomes and perks, she had become a symbol of how politicians were milking public funds while other Spaniards struggled to cope with the recession that had devastated the country since the 2008 financial crisis. In a country with 25% unemployment, here was a woman with 12 jobs.</p> <p>Many people in Le\u00f3n recall exactly what they were doing when they heard the news. Miguel \u00c1ngel Zamora, a reporter at the Diario de Le\u00f3n, was talking to a policeman after his car had been damaged by another vehicle. \u201cI heard the victim\u2019s name over his radio. I couldn\u2019t believe it,\u201d he told me. He rang his news editors, who thought he must have got it wrong. Confirmation arrived with the first photographs. A sheet covered the corpse, but the loud, fuchsia shoes were instantly recognisable. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/may/14/woman-confesses-killing-spanish-politician-isabel-carrasco\">Isabel Carrasco</a>, the woman known as the \u201cMargaret Thatcher of Le\u00f3n\u201d, was dead.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b8d02df0ef46ee594634ab8d9842dc09b8ad6a2a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b8d02df0ef46ee594634ab8d9842dc09b8ad6a2a/0_0_2500_1667/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Police stand next to the body of Isabel Carrasco at the crime scene.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Police stand next to the body of Isabel Carrasco at the crime scene.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Carlos Campillo/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Not everyone was dismayed by the assassination. \u201cThere was shock, but not much sadness. You didn\u2019t hear people saying: \u2018Poor her\u2019,\u201d said Zamora. The list of her enemies was so long, some joked, that the police would never find the killer. It had sometimes been said that the only way to unseat Carrasco would be to murder her. Nobody had meant it seriously, but now it seemed that someone had taken it that way.</p> <p>By the time of her death, and despite her party\u2019s repeated successes at elections in Le\u00f3n, Carrasco had become one of the most controversial and feared politicians in Spain. In her lifetime, people had gossiped viciously about her, often looking over their shoulder to make sure they were not overheard. Some saw her as a sort of praying mantis, seducing and devouring her victims, or as a despot who delighted in destroying her enemies. And as Le\u00f3n and the rest of Spain slipped ever deeper into recession and angry pessimism after 2008, resentment towards her had grown.</p> <p>Carrasco could be vulgar. \u201cI remember having to explain to her in a restaurant that you can\u2019t just pick your teeth with a yoghurt top in public,\u201d said one friend who asked to remain anonymous. She was constantly in and out of cosmetic surgery clinics and was unabashed about it \u2013 showing off the stitches and scars behind her ears while proclaiming that \u201cthe time comes when we all have to do this\u201d. When she became head of Le\u00f3n\u2019s <em>diputaci\u00f3n</em>, she refused to follow tradition by hanging her predecessor\u2019s portrait in the palace\u2019s cloisters. Instead, she became the first to hang her own picture.</p> <p>Carrasco had come a long way. She was a railwayman\u2019s daughter, raised down the tracks from Le\u00f3n in a small, poor village called Campo y Santib\u00e1\u00f1ez. She was part of a generation of Spaniards who entered adulthood just as the country was leaving behind the right-wing Catholic dictatorship of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/francisco-franco\">General Franco</a> and embracing democracy, progress and optimism. Women, who had previously needed their husband\u2019s signature to open a bank account and could not legally get a divorce before 1981, were finally free to pursue their ambitions outside the home. Yet such opportunities were still largely restricted to those born into privilege. Carrasco was from a humble background, but she was clever and pushy. She studied law and passed the ferociously competitive civil service exams, to become one of Spain\u2019s youngest tax inspectors. As a young woman, her energy and charisma were already legendary, as was her temper. \u201cI even remember her being angry on her wedding day,\u201d a childhood friend recalled.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>She was young, uninhibited, clever and capable. It was like planting a bomb in a world full of men</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>A brief marriage produced a daughter, Loreto, when Carrasco was 25, before she left her husband and began a rapid rise through the PP. In 1987, at the age of 32, she became the provincial delegate of the regional government of Castilla y Le\u00f3n. \u201cLe\u00f3n had never seen a woman in power,\u201d Susana Vergara, a local journalist, told me. \u201cShe was young, uninhibited, clever and capable. It was like planting a bomb in a world full of men.\u201d</p> <p>In 1991, Carrasco returned to the tax office to run the team investigating large companies and wealthy individuals. When one well-off Le\u00f3n family protested against the fines levied on them and insulted Carrasco personally, the fines were tripled. Carrasco enjoyed power, and knew how to impose it on others. \u201cShe could walk into a meeting full of men, and five minutes later be completely in charge,\u201d said her friend (and lawyer) Carlos Rivera. He saw her as a gutsy, capable woman set on taming a city traditionally run by conservative men. \u201cShe was quick, impatient, fast-talking and liked to win.\u201d</p> <p>Local party leaders were impressed, and in 1995, Carrasco returned to politics as the finance minister in the regional government of Castilla y Le\u00f3n. Eight years later, she became a senator in Madrid. Finally, in 2007, she was appointed head of Le\u00f3n\u2019s <em>diputaci\u00f3n</em> \u2013 a powerful position that gave her control over a budget of \u20ac130m.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"2ae68c7958862f31a2b126e7bc74a5fcc226e1ad\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2ae68c7958862f31a2b126e7bc74a5fcc226e1ad/0_0_1944_2664/730.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018I\u2019m a free woman\u2019 \u2026 Isabel Carrasco in 2013.\" width=\"730\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I\u2019m a free woman\u2019 \u2026 Isabel Carrasco in 2013.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: J. Casares/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The press had taken to Carrasco when she first appeared in Le\u00f3n, though her brash, open manner shocked some people. She refused to bow to expectations about how a woman should dress, speak or behave. \u201cI once heard her say loudly at a public event: \u2018I\u2019ll got to bed with whoever I want, because I\u2019m a free woman,\u2019\u201d recalled Vergara. Everybody in Le\u00f3n recalls one photograph in particular, when Carrasco turned up to a 2003 campaign event wearing a diamante choker that spelled out the word \u201cSEX\u201d. If they did not like it, Carrasco seemed to be saying, that was their problem. \u201cThey can suck my pussy!\u201d was one of the cruder phrases occasionally heard ringing around the <em>diputaci\u00f3n</em> palace when Carrasco was angry, which was frequently the case.</p> <p>When she took office in July 2007, Carrasco\u2019s first target was the cosy and corrupt business community that dominated Le\u00f3n. She waded into this world with reformist glee, according to Rivera. \u201cHer biggest enemy was the business community of Le\u00f3n. To them, she had three defects. She was a woman, she was clever and she didn\u2019t forgive people who stole.\u201d</p> <p>Yet Carrasco\u2019s efforts to curtail corruption were only ever partial, and constrained by her own love of power. Speculative, get-rich-quick deals involving real-estate developers, local politicians and savings banks helped push Spain into its dramatic double-dip recession in 2008. Even today, the country\u2019s GDP has yet to return to pre-crash levels. At Le\u00f3n\u2019s local savings bank, Caja Espa\u00f1a, the board \u2013 many of them politicians, with Carrasco as vice-president \u2013 handed out risky loans to fellow directors in 2008, including the bank\u2019s president. When the loans were not repaid, the bank lost \u20ac60m. Had she lived, Carrasco would, like the rest of the board, now be under criminal investigation.</p> <p>Rather than take people to court, Carrasco built dossiers that gave her power over them. \u201cWhenever we broke a scandal in the paper, I would go to see her, and she would open a drawer full of files and say: \u2018Is that all you have on them? You don\u2019t know half of it,\u2019\u201d said her friend \u00c1ngela Dom\u00ednguez.</p> <p>Carrasco was also a formal suspect in the irregular hiring of 40 clerks who were given jobs for life at the <em>diputaci\u00f3n</em> in 2007, shortly after she arrived. Many of those handed the jobs \u2013 after getting such impossibly high marks in the exams that the local ombudsman concluded they must have seen the questions first \u2013 had links to politicians. The only surprising thing about the story was just how blatant the cheating seemed to be.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s how <em>diputaci\u00f3nes</em> work in cities like Le\u00f3n,\u201d says Rosa Seijas, a temporary clerk who sat the exams and sued after failing to win a place. \u201cI remember the first time I worked there [as a temp], people kept asking me: \u2018Who do you belong to?\u2019\u201d The implication was that she owed her job to one of the local politicians.</p> <p>Rivera claimed the scandal of the 40 clerks, which was eventually thrown out of court on a technicality, caught the newly appointed Carrasco by surprise. She had regretted letting it go through and set about cleaning up the regional government. \u201cAll cronyism came to an end,\u201d he said. There were angry meetings at which Carrasco demanded to know who had put whom on the list. As Carrasco accumulated power, she made what Rivera calls \u201cintimate enemies\u201d inside her own party. She did not bargain or take prisoners. Le\u00f3n\u2019s power brokers never forgave her.</p> <p>Over time, her style became as bullying and confrontational as that of her worst male predecessors and rivals. She would bawl and swear at her subordinates, humiliate her staff in public and squash journalists or political rivals who dared challenge her. \u201cShe hated it if you got ahead of her,\u201d admitted Rivera. \u201cAnd she was rudest when she got lost on a subject.\u201d But that happened rarely, and she respected anyone who stood up to her. Friends found her loyal, but admit she could come across as hard and cold. \u201cShe didn\u2019t show affection or approval in a normal way,\u201d said Rivera.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/may/14/woman-confesses-killing-spanish-politician-isabel-carrasco\">Woman 'confesses to killing Spanish politician Isabel Carrasco'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In the province\u2019s villages \u2013 where she felt most at home, and to which she allocated significant public funds for infrastructure projects \u2013 people loved her. In the city, apart from among a group of faithful friends, Carrasco was increasingly feared and scorned, even by fellow members of her party. She did not build teams, because she distrusted people and thought she could do better by herself. She governed with imperious disdain, expecting others to rubber-stamp her decisions.</p> <p>She grew more and more paranoid about her enemies, both inside and outside the PP. She took on posts that previous <em>diputaci\u00f3n </em>presidents had delegated to others \u2013 hence her \u201c12 jobs\u201d (she actually held 13), on the boards of local institutions or presiding over public-private consortia such as the city\u2019s airport and tourism board. Most had attendance pay or perks attached. Yet no one was ever able to pin corruption charges on Carrasco. For some, that is proof that, whatever her failings, she was first and foremost a dedicated public servant. Others claim she was simply too clever to get caught. At the time of her death, she was being investigated for only one alleged infraction \u2013 of claiming twice for mileage. By the standards of Spanish politics, that is a minor offence.</p> <p>Although her notoriety was concentrated within the province of Le\u00f3n, Carrasco\u2019s murder was headline news across Spain. A solemn funeral was held at <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le%C3%B3n_Cathedral\">Le\u00f3n\u2019s 13th-century Santa Mar\u00eda cathedral</a>, known as the \u201chouse of light\u201d for its spectacular gothic stained-glass windows. Prime Minister Rajoy and his socialist predecessor, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/jose-luis-zapatero\">Jos\u00e9 Luis Rodr\u00edguez Zapatero</a>, both of whom had lived in Le\u00f3n as children, were among the mourners. Jes\u00fas Ramos, an architect and one of Carrasco\u2019s most intimate friends, stood at the door awaiting the coffin. \u201cShe was one of the most honest and loyal people I have known,\u201d he told me. Her 33-year-old daughter, Loreto, and Carrasco\u2019s live-in boyfriend of over a decade, Jes\u00fas L\u00f3pez, were inconsolable.</p> <p>Some days later, graffiti appeared on the concrete tiles of the footbridge, almost in the exact spot that had been stained by Carrasco\u2019s blood. \u201c<em>Aqu\u00ed muri\u00f3 un bicho</em>,\u201d it read. \u201cAn animal died here.\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Montserrat Gonz\u00e1lez and her daughter, Triana Mart\u00ednez, were unlikely murder suspects. Triana\u2019s father was a senior policeman. Her mother was a 58-year-old housewife who wore Hugo Boss and drove a Mercedes sports car. Slight and pale, Montserrat looked younger than her years. Both women were also members of the PP and had become familiar faces at party conferences, rallies and the annual Christmas dinners at the 16th-century monastery of San Marcos, which had been converted into Le\u00f3n\u2019s classiest hotel. Perhaps most shocking of all was that Triana had been one of Carrasco\u2019s protegees.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"c2742f0a467d4800ce141124ca94c1d5f3c3f83d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c2742f0a467d4800ce141124ca94c1d5f3c3f83d/0_0_4288_2848/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Montserrat Gonz\u00e1lez in court in January 2016.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"664\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Montserrat Gonz\u00e1lez in court in January 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: J Casares/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Mother and daughter had always been close. \u201cThey are one and the same,\u201d said a friend, Julia Rodr\u00edguez. \u201cWhatever one thinks, the other one thinks. If Montserrat says something then Triana says: \u2018Exactly Mama, you\u2019re right.\u2019\u201d Friends joked that Triana\u2019s husband \u2013 when she found one \u2013 could expect to share his marriage bed with his mother-in-law.</p> <p>Montserrat\u2019s life had long revolved around Triana, who attended a private school and acquired a degree of small-town sophistication that her mother \u2013 raised in a country village \u2013 could never match. Triana Mart\u00ednez was a brilliant, if spoiled, schoolchild. \u201cShe always had top grades,\u201d her father, Pablo Mart\u00ednez, told me when we met in Gij\u00f3n, the Atlantic port city where Triana grew up.</p> <p>Mart\u00ednez seems to have played a relatively minor role in Triana\u2019s childhood \u2013 either excluded by her tight bond with her mother or, as he told me, because he worked so hard. In 2003, he and Montserrat moved to Astorga, where he had been appointed police chief. He was delighted with the move, but Montserrat disliked the town. Local people thought she had delusions of grandeur. \u201cShe never greeted people in the street,\u201d said Jacinto Bardal, a local PP councillor.</p> <p>Triana had left home<strong> </strong>to study telecommunications engineering at university in Santander, 200 miles away, and when she did an Erasmus year at Ulm in southern Germany, her mother visited frequently. After graduation, Triana moved to Le\u00f3n, to the delight of her mother, who would eventually move into Triana\u2019s apartment.</p> <p>The pair shared a fascination with luxury that was mostly beyond their means, and could be seen together window-shopping, or trying perfumes and brand-name clothes. Montserrat acquired expensive bags and boots, though friends wondered where she got the money. One year, she and Triana took a holiday at Villa Padierna \u2013 a five-star spa hotel in Marbella which had hosted, among others, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/michelleobama\">Michelle Obama</a>. \u201cThey are fantasists, who want the finest things in life,\u201d said Julia Rodr\u00edguez, who went on holiday to Prague with them while Triana was a student, but found them more interested in their hotel and its little luxuries than the city.</p> <p>Triana had come to Le\u00f3n in search of a job. Spain\u2019s economy was still booming and in June 2007 she began working on telecommunications projects at the <a href=\"http://www.spain.info/en_GB/que-quieres/arte/monumentos/leon/palacio_de_los_guzmanes.html\">Palacio de los Guzmanes</a> \u2013 the<strong> </strong><em>diputaci\u00f3n</em><strong> </strong>headquarters, where visitors are greeted by a mounted medieval knight in armour. She had been given a contact by her friends in the PP, which helped her secure the first of a series of temporary contracts. Fellow workers remember her as cheerful and competent, if a little superior.</p> <p>When Isabel Carrasco took over as president the following month, she soon became Triana\u2019s friend and protector. She called Triana at all hours, even requiring her to go to her apartment to help install cable TV. Carrasco, in turn, used her influence at the tax office to resolve Montserrat\u2019s problems with her imported Mercedes.</p> <p>The ambitious young woman felt like Carrasco\u2019s protege and began to dream of two things. First, she wanted a job for life at the <em>diputaci\u00f3n</em>, of the kind enjoyed by established civil servants. A recent poll by the AXA Foundation showed that this is the career ambition for a quarter of Spanish students. Second, and against her father\u2019s wishes, Triana wanted a parallel career in politics. She was popular with senior PP officials and, since candidates for elections in Spain must find patrons to put them on the lists presented by each party, well-placed.</p> <p>By December 2009, Triana\u2019s future was looking bright. She was a PP candidate for councillor in Astorga, and that month Carrasco decided to turn her job into a permanent position. This required the <em>diputaci\u00f3n </em>to set exams, which are obligatory for any permanent public job. Anyone could apply, but Triana expected the preferential treatment given to favourites.</p> <p>Suddenly, however, Carrasco and Triana fell out. Triana would later claim that this was the result of a scene allegedly played out on the sofa at Carrasco\u2019s apartment in January 2010. \u201cShe came up close to smell my perfume, and then she kissed me on the mouth \u2026 I was scared, but she tried to touch me and put her arm around me to stop me moving away,\u201d Triana testified later in court. \u201cI managed to get away and say that I was leaving.\u201d Carrasco\u2019s friends vigorously deny this. \u201cShe had no sexual interest in women,\u201d said Ramos.</p> <p>The two women also argued at work later that year, according to some witnesses, with Carrasco warning Triana that she could either be an ally or an enemy. When exams for the new job were finally held, Triana sent an urgent text message to Carrasco. \u201cSorry to bother you, but the exam is tomorrow and I need your help to pass,\u201d it read. In other words, she was asking for the exam questions \u2013 but there was no reply. Instead, a second candidate appeared from out of town and was supposedly seen wandering off with the examiner. Triana filmed them with her phone, but did not formally challenge the appointment when the job was handed to her rival. Like many other people, Montserrat was convinced that Carrasco had brought in another candidate with the intention of denying her daughter the job. It was early 2011; Spain had fallen into a catastrophic recession three years earlier and unemployment was now 24%. Triana was out of favour, and out of work.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"c038320216bb158e1fdc811163cfb03144ffddc2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c038320216bb158e1fdc811163cfb03144ffddc2/0_0_3600_2352/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Triana Mart\u00ednez during the trial.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"653\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Triana Mart\u00ednez during the trial.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: J Casares/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Carrasco then pursued her daughter with blind hatred, Montserrat later claimed, blocking her attempt to take up a council seat in Astorga after another councillor resigned, demanding the return of \u20ac11,000 allegedly overpaid to Triana by the <em>diputaci\u00f3n </em>and getting the tax office to send claims totalling \u20ac6,000. She was convinced Carrasco also prevented her daughter finding work elsewhere in the city.</p> <p>Triana became clinically depressed, and lost weight. Her father advised her to leave Le\u00f3n and take her skills elsewhere. \u201cBut she wanted to be near her mother,\u201d he told me. \u201cThat was her priority.\u201d So Montserrat moved in with her daughter. Her husband, who stayed behind in Astorga, did not complain. He insists that his wife and daughter barely spoke to him about Carrasco. \u201cThat was something between the two of them,\u201d he said.</p> <p>A year before the murder, Montserrat approached Carrasco at a party and called her a \u201cshameless daughter of a whore\u201d. \u201cWhat are you doing to my daughter?\u201d she demanded. The normally sweet-natured Triana had also lost her temper when told by local councillor Bardal that she could not stand as a PP candidate again. She and her father, she said, would make sure the PP lost the next local election. Carrasco complained that Triana was turning out to be \u201cwicked and rebellious, though the mother is worse\u201d. By this time, Montserrat had decided Carrasco had to die. \u201cIt was my daughter, or her,\u201d she said later. \u201cBad weeds must be torn out.\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Police were under intense pressure to solve one of Spain\u2019s most shocking recent murders quickly and efficiently. The victim was a senior politician from the country\u2019s ruling party and television news shows \u2013 enjoying a respite from corruption scandals and unemployment \u2013 were speculating wildly. The alleged perpetrators, meanwhile, were part of the wider police family and needed careful treatment. Le\u00f3n was not used to being at the centre of national events. It had a force of experienced investigators headed by the capable new <em>comisaria provincial</em>, Mar\u00eda Marcos \u2013 but two veteran detectives were also sent from the bigger city of Burgos. It was they who interviewed Montserrat and Triana the following morning.</p> <p>The footbridge and the spot where Montserrat had been arrested were only 500 metres apart, yet trawling through rubbish bins and dredging the river bed produced nothing. All they had was Mielgo\u2019s eyewitness report and, in the boot of the Mercedes, they had found a Hugo Boss parka that resembled the one seen on the murderer.</p> <p>The evidence, however, soon built up against Montserrat. A search of the Le\u00f3n apartment revealed that she owned a small pistol \u2013 not the one used in the crime \u2013 and an array of ammunition, including .32 calibre bullets. She also had two-thirds of a kilo of marijuana. A photograph found on a laptop showed a smiling Montserrat and her daughter beside a towering cannabis plant. This was one of several that grew beside the chicken run in her own mother\u2019s village backyard. The police chief\u2019s wife, it turned out, was an enthusiastic consumer and cultivator of cannabis.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The murder had been committed at one of the most dramatic spots in the city. It was like a ceremonial killing</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It did not take long for Montserrat to confess. She must have known, in any case, that forensic tests would prove that she had recently fired a weapon. She had acted alone and out of hatred, she claimed. She would explain everything if they promised to release her daughter.</p> <p>Montserrat claimed that she had heard many tales from her husband about the Gij\u00f3n underworld and that she knew where to get hold of a pistol in that city. She had bought one from a drug trafficker and rapist who, conveniently, had since been murdered. She had been trying to kill Carrasco for more than a year, frequently waiting outside her apartment building with a pistol in her pocket, but had stopped after a neighbour became suspicious and confronted her. On the day of the murder, she had walked past the building again and, she said, got lucky. Carrasco was, unusually, on her own. They knew the rest. And she was not sorry.</p> <p>The murder weapon was finally discovered late on the day after the crime. A 39-year-old municipal police officer, Raquel Gago, rang a colleague to say she had seen a suspicious bag hidden among the mess on the back seat of her own car. It must have been placed there, she said, by Triana Mart\u00ednez. Inside the bag, police found a snub-nosed .32 calibre Taurus pistol with its identity numbers filed off.</p> <p>Gago was, apart from Montserrat, Triana\u2019s best friend. She had stopped by their flat for coffee after lunch on the day of the murder. The policewoman had seen her friend again some 10 minutes after the shooting, when Triana walked past her as she chatted to a traffic warden beside her parked Volkswagen Golf. Triana had asked if she could leave something in the car while she went to buy fruit, but never came back.</p> <p>Police began to suspect that Montserrat had had an accomplice as she plotted what was meant to be a perfect crime: her own daughter. Triana now had to explain how she got hold of the weapon \u2013 and disposed of it \u2013 so quickly.</p> <p>Triana told investigators that she thought she had quashed her mother\u2019s fantasy of killing Carrasco long before. On the day of the murder her mother had called her, hysterical, saying she had sighted Carrasco and planned to shoot her. Triana had told her to stop and then ran towards the bridge. She arrived in time to see her mother walking back into town and throwing a bag down the garage ramp of an apartment block. They did not speak, but Triana realised that the bag might contain a gun, and so retrieved it. She had then bumped into Gago, put it in her car and gone on to find her mother being arrested.</p> <p>\u201cThat was when she called me,\u201d her father \u2013 an outwardly modest, conservative man with a policeman\u2019s trademark inscrutability \u2013 told me later. \u201cIt was like being immersed in cold water and then having an electric charge shot through me.\u201d Lying to protect your own family \u2013 even in a court of law \u2013 is not a crime in Spain. Triana claimed that, believing her mother had used her father\u2019s gun, she had lied in order to protect both her parents.</p> <p>Investigators were not convinced. They had found a search for pistols on Triana\u2019s laptop and notebook jottings on guns that were for sale in her handwriting. Even Gago\u2019s story did not add up. Why had it taken her 30 hours to report that the murder suspect had placed something in her car? The case was strange enough already, but when the police officer was formally accused of conspiracy, it become even more bizarre.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"18dafc705af9e3620e84ace6f681d8a32e714a62\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/18dafc705af9e3620e84ace6f681d8a32e714a62/0_0_3000_2000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Carrasco\u2019s funeral in the Santa Mar\u00eda cathedral in Le\u00f3n, May 2014.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Carrasco\u2019s funeral in the Santa Mar\u00eda cathedral in Le\u00f3n, May 2014.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Montserrat claimed the police had promised that, if she confessed, her daughter could walk free. But that did not happen. By the time mother and daughter went to trial for murder in Le\u00f3n\u2019s central court in January 2016 \u2013 with snow on the hills and a damp, penetrating chill on the streets \u2013 both women had spent 20 months on remand in jail. (Gago, facing the same charges, had been bailed.)</p> <p>Formally, the nine-person jury had to decide on the guilt or innocence of the three women (with Montserrat now claiming temporary insanity). But the victim\u2019s own guilt was also being debated, with public opinion as the jury. Le\u00f3n itself had already turned its back on Carrasco. Few people attended the events commemorating the first anniversary of her death. The local PP, now run by what Rivera called her \u201cintimate enemies\u201d, tried to pretend that she never existed. \u201cDuring her life she provoked terror and panic,\u201d explained Susana Mart\u00edn, a local journalist who interviewed Montserrat and Triana in jail. \u201cBut now she still provokes fear.\u201d</p> <p>Both mother and daughter appeared convinced that Triana would be found not guilty. They were wrong. The judge gave Montserrat and Triana sentences of 22 and 20 years, but when Mart\u00edn visited them in prison a few months later they had not lost their capacity for fantasy. They were sure that Triana would be released on appeal, and even asked the journalist to wait to take photographs until then. \u201cI am an engineer,\u201d Triana scoffed. \u201cWhat kind of a genius plans a murder in the middle of Le\u00f3n at five in the afternoon?\u201d Yet that appeal failed and, like Gago (who was deemed an accomplice and handed a 12-year sentence), they now await a final supreme court decision. Montserrat, who is also appealing, remains unrepentant. \u201cI just want to get out so I can tell everyone the truth about Carrasco,\u201d she told Mart\u00edn.</p> <p>Spain\u2019s first Twitter hate-crime arrest was that of a 19-year-old student in Valencia who greeted Carrasco\u2019s death with the tweet: \u201cThat\u2019s the way! Kill them all.\u201d The applause that greeted the murder in certain quarters owed much to the mindset of Spaniards who were fed up with politicians lining their pockets while they themselves scrabbled for jobs, had homes repossessed or coped with dramatic falls in income, according to \u00c1ngela Dom\u00ednguez. Carrasco\u2019s tyrannical reputation \u2013 and the corruption rumours \u2013 had helped make her a target. \u201cPart of society saw it as an almost necessary ritual,\u201d she said. \u201cThere is a shared responsibility.\u201d</p> <p>Although people in Le\u00f3n complained privately about Carrasco, few had dared to confront her. Perhaps they feared that, without a pistol in their hand, they were always bound to lose. Rosa Seijas, who sued over the fixed exam system, sees a cowed society that has accepted cronyism as inevitable. \u201cEveryone complains, but nobody does anything,\u201d she said. \u201cThey just say that this is the way things work. In fact, all they want is to find a way to get their own offspring a civil service job.\u201d Carrasco\u2019s architect friend, Jes\u00fas Ramos, says that the poisoned atmosphere in Le\u00f3n reflected what he calls Spain\u2019s \u201cfamilist\u201d society \u2013 where a weak welfare state provides no real safety net. \u201cHere, your family looks after you,\u201d he said. That makes cronyism inevitable, even virtuous. In this case, it primed a mother to kill.</p> <p>The woman who pulled the trigger, however, acted out of revenge for her daughter, hurt pride and frustrated grandeur \u2013 not from moral or political indignation. After all, her daughter\u2019s desire to land a job for life, funded by taxpayers, through rigged exams was a further example of corruption. An assassin who drives a Mercedes and wears Hugo Boss does not represent the jobless rage of Spain\u2019s new poor. If anything, she represents a society where the corrupt distribution of public wealth is so widespread that some feel they have a right to demand their share \u2013 and, in this case, if they do not get it, a right to kill for it.</p> <p>\u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gdnlongread\">@gdnlongread</a>, or sign up to the Long Read weekly email <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2015/jul/20/sign-up-to-the-long-read-email\">here</a>.<br></p> <p>\u2022 Producing in-depth, thoughtful, well-reported journalism like the Long Read is difficult and expensive \u2013 but supporting us isn\u2019t.

Legal and ethics experts contacted by the Associated Press said the government lobbyist should be subject to the same ethics rules as rank-and-file state employees, which generally prohibit such double-dipping. A separate prohibition against moonlighting bans Indiana state employees from accepting outside employment or undertaking activities that are not compatible with their public duties, would impair their independence or judgment, or pose a likely conflict of interest.</p> <p>The governor\u2019s office said Pitcock is exempt from most such rules because the Pence administration treats Pitcock as an independent contractor. It considers his contract for \u201cprofessional services\u201d different than contracts for \u201cpersonal\u201d services, which treat contractors as employees.</p> <p>Pence defended the arrangement late Wednesday. \u201cThe arrangement that the state of Indiana has with a firm in Washington DC has been a great, great success for our state,\u201d he told television station KDVR in Denver in an interview. \u201cThat individual and his team have worked very effectively advocating Indiana\u2019s interest.

An <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/us/general_election_trump_vs_clinton-5491.html\">average of six different polls</a> shows that Clinton is now just 1.7 percentage points ahead of Trump. But there\u2019s still a lot of variation \u2013 one poll finds that Clinton is three points ahead, another finds that she is six points <em>behind </em>Trump. Both surveys were conducted after news that the justice department had obtained a warrant to investigate an aide to Clinton\u2019s emails, before which her lead was already shrinking.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"81b2cb4ef2ea7948f9e4f887bec8e8776aa309df\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/81b2cb4ef2ea7948f9e4f887bec8e8776aa309df/0_101_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A polling station worker helps a woman as she votes during early voting in Chicago.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A polling station worker helps a woman as she votes during early voting in Chicago.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joshua Lott/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>That variation between polls isn\u2019t surprising \u2013 it can be explained by the fact that different polls speak to different people. For example, the LA Times poll which has consistently found that Trump has more national support, includes one <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/13/upshot/how-one-19-year-old-illinois-man-is-distorting-national-polling-averages.html\">19-year-old black male</a> respondent who consistently said he\u2019ll vote for the Republican nominee. That one individual has a disproportionate impact because of a statistical process called <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/video/2016/jun/01/political-polls-bad-for-democracy-heres-why-video\">weighting</a> (where one respondent can end up representing hundreds of thousands of voters).</p> <p>So, are current polls a good reflection of what will happen on election day? Historically, the answer is \u201cnot bad\u201d, although they will probably be a much better indicator by the morning of 8 November rather than now. Clinton\u2019s email scandal will probably go down in US political history as an \u201c<a href=\"http://politicaldictionary.com/words/october-surprise/\">October surprise</a>\u201d, a last-minute news event that can cause a shift in public opinion. Those surprises \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/01/us/october-surprises-dont-necessarily-sway-elections-or-occur-in-october.html\">which have included Lyndon Johnson\u2019s announcement of a halt in the bombing of North Vietnam in 1968, and the news of a drunk-driving charge for George W Bush in 2000</a> \u2013 typically don\u2019t affect final outcomes all that much though, as the chart below shows. It compares polling a week before from election day and the morning of with the final voting outcome.</p> <p>The only snag is the electoral college system. In 2000, it wasn\u2019t just ABC and the Washington Post that predicted a Bush win \u2013 polling averages also showed the Republican <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-much-do-october-surprises-move-the-polls/\">three points</a> ahead of Al Gore. Though both candidates ended up with 48% of the popular vote, that\u2019s only after rounding. The actual result was Gore-Bush, <a href=\"http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/national.php?f=0&amp;year=2000\">48.4%-47.9%</a>. Bush ultimately became president because the distribution of those votes worked in his favour \u2013 he collected 271 of the 538 electoral college votes (270 are needed to win).</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/02/election-polls-hillary-clinton-donald-trump-october-surprise\">Clinton's 'October surprise' helps Trump in polls \u2013 but will it affect election day?</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-581a672ce4b07ceadb3a1cbb\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/nicky-woolf\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-02T22:23:12.872Z\">10.23pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>A white nationalist has apologized for robocalls in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/utah\">Utah</a> calling independent presidential candidate Evan McMullin a \u201ccloset homosexual\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dbaf826e0a147ea78e74a9ab5880fa57afb67f7c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dbaf826e0a147ea78e74a9ab5880fa57afb67f7c/0_0_4800_2881/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Evan McMullin.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Evan McMullin.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rick Bowmer/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>William Daniel Johnson is a Los Angeles-based lawyer and self-described white nationalist who was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/10/donald-trump-white-nationalist-delegate-database-error\">originally meant to be a delegate for Donald Trump</a> at the Republican national convention.</p> <p>On Monday, Johnson announced that he was putting out an automated call to Utah voters attacking McMullin, an independent conservative candidate who has become the <a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/2016/10/19/independent-presidential-candidate-evan-mcmullin-leads-in-utah--new-poll.html\">unexpected frontrunner</a> in the heavily Mormon state, according to recent polls.</p> <p>\u201cMy name is William Johnson.

It was the highest-rated Game 6 since the New York Yankees\u2019 2009 clincher against Philadelphia drew a 13.4/22 and the most-watched since Cleveland\u2019s win at Florida in 1997 was seen by 23.7 million.</p> <p>The game drew 425,000 for Spanish-language coverage on Fox Deportes and 151,000 for digital coverage on Fox Sports Go, for a total audience of 24 million.</p> <p>This year\u2019s Series entered Game 7 averaging an 11.3/20 and 20 million viewers, the most watched since Boston\u2019s four-game sweep of St. Louis in 2004.</p> <p>The rating is the percentage of television households tuned to a program, and the share is the percentage showing a broadcast among those homes with TVs on at the time.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-581a79cee4b0d073c27d0dd4\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-02T23:45:15.622Z\">11.45pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Email</strong></p> <p>Here\u2019s a little numerology from reader Mark Wagner.

Remember Clayton Kershaw in Game 5 of the NLDS coming out of the bullpen to get the last two outs of the clinching game for the Dodgers? It feels like about four months ago. Both managers tonight have that same dilemma but in different ways.</p> <p>Cleveland\u2019s Terry Francona has a reasonably-rested ace reliever Andrew Miller to use tonight if he needs. Francona gave no indication about how long he will pitch Miller \u2013 if at all \u2013 but he talked about how he has brought Miller into games in the fifth inning in the past and left open the idea that he would again in this game.</p> <p>Cubs manager Joe Maddon talked to Game 5 starter Jon Lester after last night\u2019s game and suggested that Lester could pitch at least an inning or two if the Cubs needed him.</p> <p>\u201cJon\u2019s able,\u201d Maddon said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to put him into a dirty inning, I don\u2019t think that would be appropriate. But being that it\u2019s on his regular workout day, he\u2019s probably got a solid two in him.\u201d<br></p> <p>Maddon also said he did not regret using his closer Aroldis Chapman for long stretches in the last two games, potentially weakening Chapman\u2019s effectiveness.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s about winning now,\u201d Maddon said. \u201cYesterday that was a real clear-cut decision for me, how to work (the 7<sup>th</sup> inning when Chapman came in) the threat there was that had we not done it then Aroldis would have had a mores stressful 1- 1 2/3 innings in the eighth and ninth.\u201d</p> <p>END - David here again...</p> <p>It\u2019s interesting about Lester - and remember, his entering the game also means a switch at catcher, a move that means less in the American League.

The airwaves were buzzing all day long about a possible formula for Francona - four innings from starter Corey Kluber, three from Andrew Miller and two from Allen. That\u2019s a best case scenario of course, and is likely if the Indians manage to get on top of Cubs starter Kyle Hendricks. </p> <p>Just a quick note about his benching of Tyler Naquin - in an era of cagey coaches and managers, it was refreshing to hear his candid comments, where he said that he was \u201cpressing a little bit. During the regular season you might kind of let him get through it, but with one game left and with [Corey] Kluber pitching, we\u2019re trying to put a premium on catching the ball.\u201d</p> <p>But that\u2019s just Tito, a tremendous managerial talent, who also is also cool enough let the world in on how he fell asleep eating pretzels and peanut butter last night, waking up now and then to take another bite. </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-581a70a2e4b0d073c27d0db9\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-02T23:18:32.697Z\">11.18pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>A big night ahead...</strong></p> <p>David Lengel here...</p> <p>If a certain iconic baseball broadcaster were writing this live blog, perhaps he would start off with \u201cHello everybody and a very pleasant evening to you wherever you may be.\u201d </p> <p>And actually, it\u2019s much more than a pleasant evening, or morning or afternoon for baseball fans, and that\u2019s because we\u2019re about an hour away from what is unquestionably the most highly anticipated finish to a season in recent memory. </p> <p>Personally speaking, I\u2019ve been jumping out of my skin all day long waiting for first pitch, waiting to watch what happens right along with what will be a mammoth global baseball audience. </p> <p>It\u2019s perhaps less pleasant for fans of the Chicago Cubs and the Cleveland Indians: their supporters have been tortured for decades, and are agonizing about what may or may not happen right up until the very end of one of their age-old title droughts.

The Diamondbacks\u2019 Curt Schilling against the Yankees\u2019 Roger Clemens in 2001 and the Royals\u2019 Bret Saberhagen against the Cardinals\u2019 John Tudor in 1985.</p> <p>Both pitchers spoke with the media before last night\u2019s Game 6. Here are some excerpts:</p> <h2>Corey Kluber</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"92c661024efc09710acdbadf515f291b0011e1cb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/92c661024efc09710acdbadf515f291b0011e1cb/0_73_2147_1289/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Corey Kluber starts for Cleveland tonight.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Corey Kluber starts for Cleveland tonight.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jerry Lai/USA Today Sports</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Given this has been your first postseason experience, how valuable do you think this month has been for you just in terms of overall development even moving forward?</strong></p> <p><strong>Kluber</strong>: I think first and foremost it\u2019s been a blast. I think that we\u2019ve all really enjoyed ourselves. I think we can take a lot from the way we approached it, and not treating it more than just each game is another game and trying to go out and win that day. Not trying to look too far ahead or things like that. I think there\u2019s value to taking that approach throughout the course of a season, too.</p> <p><strong>For years and years, the regular routine was to have starters pitch on three days\u2019 rest, and then in seven days it became four days. For you, what is the difference now that you\u2019ve come back once on three days and might do it again tomorrow?</strong></p> <p><strong>Kluber</strong>: I mean, I guess for me personally I spend a little more time doing the different methods of recovery and stuff like that that we have available to us.</p> <p>But I still get in the same amount of work in between, it\u2019s just a little bit more condensed. I haven\u2019t, for me personally, I haven\u2019t found much of a difference yet in the way I feel when I go out there on three days\u2019 rest as opposed to four. And I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s just doing the extra recovery stuff to where you get as close to normal as you can possibly get. But that\u2019s really the only difference for me is spending more time trying to recover on those three days instead of having four days to do it.</p> <p><strong>All season long you knew when you were going to pitch, and tomorrow obviously you don\u2019t know if you\u2019re going to pitch. So what is your mental frame thinking about tomorrow as of right now?</strong></p> <p><strong>Kluber</strong>: I mean, doing all my work in between the last start, and if it gets to tomorrow, that start. In doing all my work it was the same trying to get myself prepared. I\u2019ll be rooting as hard as anybody for us to win tonight. But I think that my mindset was I\u2019d rather be prepared and not have to pitch than try to will us to not get to a Game 7 and then not be ready when it comes.</p> <h2>Kyle Hendricks</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3934c814c91622ae71377a6f490547d04e7400a5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3934c814c91622ae71377a6f490547d04e7400a5/0_0_4096_2282/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kyle Hendricks is on the mound for Chicago.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"557\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kyle Hendricks is on the mound for Chicago.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tannen Maury/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Kyle, knock on wood, there\u2019s a Game 7 for you tomorrow, what would it mean? It\u2019s the ultimate in baseball to pitch a Game 7.</strong></p> <p><strong>Hendricks</strong>: Exactly, this is the ultimate dream. You dream of getting to the World Series, winning the World Series. When you\u2019re out in your backyard as a kid, playing Little League at the field with your friends, this is the moment you dream about, Game 7, 3-2, two outs, something like that, bottom of the 9th. But it\u2019s always Game 7 of the World Series.</p> <p>So when we get there tomorrow, I\u2019m just going to embrace the opportunity like I have the rest of this postseason, honestly. Approach it like any other game, simple thoughts, the same old thing.</p> <p><strong>You have a guy on your team who won a Game 7 in 2002 and won a Game 6 three years ago in John Lackey. Has he imparted any wisdom on you about how to handle tomorrow?</strong></p> <p><strong>Hendricks</strong>: Not particularly in regards to tomorrow, but I\u2019ve learned so much from John already. I think the way he approaches every single game, you know, I think that\u2019s what prepares him for those big games and that\u2019s what I\u2019ve learned watching him, and I\u2019ve tried to implement some of that into my routine, just taking that same ruthless approach, every day, every single start, even the regular season. So that when you get to these big moments, it\u2019s basically like it has been the whole year, I think.</p> <p><strong>What\u2019s your take on a team having a guy starting games 1, 4, and 7 and Kluber in particular?</strong></p> <p><strong>Hendricks</strong>: You know, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s too many guys that could do it to start, so obviously he\u2019s a special guy. But Kluber, you can just see it. The way he takes to the mound, he\u2019s always locked in. He has a very, very good mental approach from what you can see from the outside, keeping things simple, just trying to execute pitches.</p> <p>Like I said, there\u2019s not many guys in this league that could do that. I think it speaks volumes to him as a pitcher and what he can do.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-11-02T19:26:09.531Z\">at 7.26pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-581a247de4b0d073c27d0c18\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-02T17:46:05.628Z\">5.46pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Hello and welcome</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong><em>Game seven</em>.</strong> It\u2019s been said they\u2019re the two greatest words in sports \u2013 besides, perhaps, <em>free beer</em> or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/gallery/2015/apr/06/meat-cheese-and-lots-of-calories-mlb-stadium-foods-in-pictures?CMP=share_btn_tw&amp;page=with:img-12#img-12\"><em>brunch burger</em></a> \u2013 a one-off crucible where the winners through the years have been minted as legends and the losers cruelly fitted with goat horns.</p> <p>Tonight the Chicago Cubs and Cleveland Indians will face off in the seventh game of a World Series that\u2019s deadlocked at three games apiece.

  "<p>Mel Gibson isn\u2019t the sort of film-maker who uses spoonfuls of sugar to help the medicine go down. The director of grisly meditations Braveheart, The Passion of the Christ, Apocalypto and now Hacksaw Ridge is more the kind to pour a bottle of spirits into an open wound, then throw a match on it.<br></p> <p>Gibson is terrific at painting blood-stained moving pictures of humans caught in primitive horrors that trigger profound repercussions \u2013 from the end of the Mayan civilisation, to Jesus hanging from a cross. He also exhibits great skill geographically orienting audiences, finding visual clarity in chaos. </p> <p>That\u2019s a talent Gibson picked up as an actor from his first feature film director, George Miller. The Mad Max creator has a remarkably linear approach to configuring spatial arrangements: audiences understand at all times where they are in the relation to people and objects on screen, no matter what bedlam the characters are in the thick of. </p> <p>It rubbed off on Miller\u2019s actor-cum-director-in-his-own-right apprentice. As Hugo Weaving, on the press circuit for Gibson\u2019s hardboiled second world war action-drama Hacksaw Ridge, put it: \u201cHe\u2019s describing an infinitely chaotic world. And yet the storytelling capabilities of Mel are so extraordinary that he can, bullet to bullet, let you know as a viewer where you are in this film now, even on the battlefield.\u201d </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c0d38a0a96b09b6bec60d85b71599cac89d2d0bd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c0d38a0a96b09b6bec60d85b71599cac89d2d0bd/0_0_1969_1313/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mel Gibson on the set of Hacksaw Ridge.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018The storytelling capabilities of Mel are so extraordinary\u2019: Hugo Weaving on Mel Gibson.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Rogers</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The fog, smoke and stink of war put Gibson\u2019s behind-the-camera skills through the wringer. The director comes out firing. Every film, as they say, is a tough fight to make. But occasionally you feel pain practically weeping from the screen. You can in Hacksaw Ridge, as you could in The Passion of the Christ. These are in-your-face movies. </p> <p>But Rachel Griffiths, paired with Weaving for the interview (despite making the film in Australia, Gibson granted no interviews to local media), doesn\u2019t find Gibson\u2019s films confrontational per se.</p> <p>\u201cI think they\u2019re incredibly kinesthetic,\u201d she says. \u201cMaybe some people find that confrontational. I don\u2019t find them politically confrontational. In their proposition \u2013 in their moral proposition \u2013 they\u2019re not confrontational. I just think they\u2019re extraordinarily physical and visceral, and I think they\u2019re kind of like going on a ride. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/sep/04/hacksaw-ridge-review-mel-gibson-finds-a-conscience-in-gruesome-war-story\">Hacksaw Ridge review \u2013 Mel Gibson finds a conscience in gruesome war story</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cWhen you\u2019re getting on a Mel Gibson ride it is a rollercoaster.

For this one, the description resonates. Desmond simply will not touch a weapon. He faces ridicule, and much worse, from fellow soldiers while training at home, and has to fight tooth-and-nail to go to war unarmed. </p> <p>Hacksaw Ridge is a repudiation of the argument that ends justify means. The protagonist, like Gibson, is also religious: a devout Seventh Day Adventist. </p> <p>\u201cThere are religious images within it,\u201d Weaving says, \u201cbut to me it\u2019s more interesting to see this film as about a man who has very strong faith and a very strong ideal. Very strong sense of what he will and won\u2019t do. And how holding on to that belief \u2013 whatever that belief is \u2013 is the thing that propels the movie ... In this circumstance, in war, killing is \u2013 come on man, that\u2019s what everybody does! But I believe killing is wrong in any circumstance, says our hero. And that\u2019s what makes the film interesting.\u201d</p> <p>Griffiths compares Hacksaw Ridge\u2019s messages to the \u201cfor the greater good\u201d-style arguments that tend to be made about contentious issues. </p> <p>\u201cWe all know torture\u2019s wrong.

  "<p>People who immigrate to the UK do not take jobs from local workers, George Osborne has said.</p> <p>The former chancellor said the hard data did not back up the claim that immigration meant lost jobs to British workers, contradicting the prime minister who told the Conservative party conference last month that she sided with people who had lost jobs \u201cbecause of low-skilled immigration\u201d.</p> <p>Theresa May said: \u201cIf you\u2019re one of those people who lost their job, who stayed in work but on reduced hours, took a pay cut as household bills rocketed, or \u2013 and I know a lot of people don\u2019t like to admit this \u2013 someone who finds themselves out of work or on lower wages because of low-skilled immigration, life simply doesn\u2019t seem fair \u2026 So change has got to come.\u201d</p> <p>Speaking to an audience of academics and journalists at the London School of Economics on Wednesday, Osborne said: \u201cWe are actually close to full employment in this country. So I think this sort of argument that, somehow, the immigrants are taking jobs that are leaving a load of people unemployed in Britain doesn\u2019t really stack up.\u201d</p> <p>He did, however, say that many of the jobs that people could find were not of sufficient quality and that the skills possessed by the British workforce could be improved, adding that a skills shortage had been \u201cbig challenge and problem \u2026 for many decades\u201d.</p> <p>But Osborne said the data showed the UK\u2019s employment rate to be one of the highest in the world\u201d, while its rate of unemployment was \u201cthe lowest its been since 1971. So, I don\u2019t really buy the argument that there\u2019s a big pool of British people who don\u2019t have jobs, who need jobs. I\u2019m all for trying to improve the quality of people\u2019s jobs and, actually, the most recent data showed that the incomes of the poorest 5% were rising at 6% a year, which is, I would say, an achievement.\u201d</p> <p>A <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/20/reality-check-are-eu-migrants-really-taking-british-jobs\">recent study</a> found evidence that migrants from within the EU did not take jobs from people already living in Britain and that there was little evidence of wage depression, even in the lowest-paid jobs.<br></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/mar/06/report-foreign-migrants-british-workers-jobs-immigration\">Other research</a> has suggested there is little evidence that migrants from outside the EU put workers already in the UK out of jobs in times of economic growth, though there was some evidence of displacement during the recession.</p>",

We apologise for the hurt caused by agencies acting in the name of the Catholic church.\u201d</p> <p>The documentary, Britain\u2019s Adoption Scandal: Breaking the Silence, relates the stories of several women whose babies were given up for adoption over the 30-year period. Adoption reached a peak in 1968, when more than 16,000 babies born to unmarried mothers were handed over to new families.</p> <p>Some women in the programme said they were offered no alternative to adoption and were sometimes mistreated.

She said: \u201cI have always put great faith in the church and the goodwill to put the wrongs of the past right. I hope and believe that his Holiness Pope Francis joins me in the fight to help the thousands of mothers and children who need closure on their own stories.\u201d</p> <p>In 2011, the <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/religion/8660249/Australias-Roman-Catholic-Church-apologises-for-forced-adoptions.html\">Catholic church in Australia apologised</a> for the forced adoption of 150,000 babies in Catholic-run hospitals.<br></p> <p>In Britain, religious institutions ran 150 mother-and-baby homes in the postwar years. St Pelagia\u2019s home for destitute girls in Highgate, north London, founded by an order of nuns, organised the adoption of thousands of babies before it closed in 1971. Young women were obliged to work in the laundry in return for their keep. In 1976, the main responsibility for handling adoptions was moved from voluntary organisations, which were mainly religious, to local authorities.<br></p> <p>Carolynn Gallwey, of Bhatt Murphy Solicitors, is one of a team of lawyers demanding an inquiry into the handling of adoptions up to 1976. \u201cThese women \u2026 are entitled to have their experiences recognised, and the only way to that is through a public inquiry,\u201d she said.<br></p> <p>The Catholic Children\u2019s Society \u2013 called the Crusade of Rescue until 1985 \u2013 pointed to different social attitudes in the postwar decades. \u201cWhen you look back to the 1940s, 50s and 60s, in society in general and in terms of government policy, there was very little support for unmarried mothers, or mothers who were married but had a child by a different man,\u201d said chief executive Rosemary Keenan. \u201cSociety\u2019s attitudes have changed.</p> <p>\u201cFrom looking back at our records from sample years, we estimate that 75% of mothers that came to our organisation kept their babies. But it would have been difficult for them because of the values of wider society. Most women were in a very desperate situation and would have felt pressure from many sources.\u201d<br></p> <p>The Crusade of Rescue had lobbied for a change in law to allow adopted children and birth mothers to discover details about the circumstances of the adoption, she said. Since 1975, adopted children have had the legal right to obtain their birth and adoption records.</p> <p>Responding to the account by one of the women featured in the television documentary, the Salvation Army said: \u201cWe sincerely sympathise with Margaret\u2019s painful memories and can only confirm that her experiences would be different today.\u201d<br></p> <p>C of E organisations involved in adoption had also helped adopted children trace their birth mothers, according to a spokesperson. Many of the postwar organisations no longer existed, but current independent organisations \u201clinked to but outside the structures of the Church of England still work for the best interests of children and have helped in tracing mothers and children.\u201d<br></p> <p><em>Britain\u2019s Adoption Scandal: Breaking the Silence will be broadcast on ITV at 9pm on Wednesday 9 November</em></p>",
  "<p>The number of children who are homeless and in temporary accommodation this Christmas will hit an eight-year year high of more than 120,000, according to analysis by a leading housing charity.</p> <p>Shelter said the figure was the highest since 2007 when 133,000 children were in temporary accommodation, and 12% up on a year ago. </p> <p>\u201cBecause of the rising cost and shortage of housing, coupled with budget cuts, councils are finding it difficult to find suitable, settled homes for families,\u201d it said in its Desperate to Escape report. \u201cConsequently, more and more families are stuck in temporary accommodation, unable to move on.\u201d</p> <p>The charity added together government data for England, Scotland and Wales for the second quarter of 2016. It said 121,455 children were in temporary housing across the country, of whom 12,903 were in emergency accommodation, including B&amp;Bs and hostels. The latter figure was more than doubled the 5,731 recorded five years ago. Other types of temporary accommodation include houses and flats offered by councils while they find permanent lodgings for people they have accepted as homeless.<br></p> <p>Alongside its analysis, Shelter conducted interviews with 25 families in emergency B&amp;Bs, hostels or sofa-surfing, about half of whom had been in that situation for longer than six months. the charity found that more than two-thirds felt their children\u2019s mental and emotional health had been badly affected by their situation.<br></p> <p>The families gave accounts of children becoming anxious, isolated from their friends and struggling to sleep. Half of the parents questioned said their children\u2019s development had been negatively affected by their housing situation.</p> <p>Every family lived in a single room without any space for the children to play, and more than half of parents also had to share a bed with their children. More than three-quarters of families said they felt their accommodation was unsafe, with the worst accounts involving exposure to drug abuse and fighting, and strangers sleeping in the corridors.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"256949767ca11a64a9653295f2284fc89ab56d16\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/256949767ca11a64a9653295f2284fc89ab56d16/0_40_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A homeless person\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rising rents in the private sector have put councils under pressure to find homes for residents who have been accepted as homeless.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jonathan Brady/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Shelter was set up in 1966, shortly after Ken Loach\u2019s seminal film Cathy Come Home was screened by the BBC. Campbell Robb, the charity\u2019s chief executive, said 50 years on too many families still needed Shelter\u2019s help.<br></p> <p>He said: \u201cAlmost daily we hear from parents desperate to escape the single cramped room of a B&amp;B or hostel that they find themselves struggling to raise their children in. Imagine having to eat all of your meals on the floor, share a bed with the rest of your family, or being too frightened to leave your room at night \u2013 these are things no parent wants their child to endure.\u201d</p> <p>Glenn Hodges has been living in a room in a hostel with his 10-year-old son, Cam, since February. \u201cI thought it would be only a couple of months but it has been eight,\u201d he said. The room has a kitchenette, but they share the bathroom with other people. </p> <p>The rent is \u00a3700 a month, some of which is met by housing benefit, but Hodges said his contribution had made it hard to save up for alternative housing. \u201cYou have no privacy and no security. You can\u2019t relax,\u201d he said. \u201cThey come round every day and check the room.\u201d<br></p> <p>The hostel rules say residents cannot have overnight guests, so Hodges has been unable to let his other two children stay. And life has been difficult for Cam. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t have his own room to express himself. He can\u2019t have his friends over,\u201d Hodges said. </p> <p>Hodges said Christmas at the hostel was \u201cnot something to look forward to\u201d, but that he had managed to find somewhere else to live and would move out this weekend. \u201cBut there will be plenty of other families here who will still be here at Christmas,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Rising rents in the private sector have put councils under pressure to find homes for residents who have been accepted as homeless. In some parts of the country, councils are housing people in accommodation outside of the local area to reduce their use of B&amp;BS. Recently, <a href=\"http://www.mklabour.org.uk/tackling_housing_crisis_october_2016\">Milton Keynes council took on 110 flats in Luton to avoid having to house people in B&amp;Bs</a> after a 96% increase in the number of families in temporary accommodation.</p>",
  "<p>Marine investigators are calling for the wearing of lifejackets to be a legal requirement on commercial trawlers after a spate of deaths at sea.</p> <p><a href=\"http:// https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/marine-accident-investigation-branch \">The Marine Accident Investigation Branch </a> took the unusual step of recommending legislation as it released reports into four of the nine commercial fishing deaths so far this year. </p> <p>CI Steve Clinch, who heads the branch, said: \u201cThe MAIB rarely recommends the introduction of new legislation to solve safety problems, but the rate that commercial fishermen are losing their lives due to drowning shows no sign of reducing. </p> <p>\u201cThis has been a particularly bad year: the MAIB has investigated the deaths of nine commercial fishermen, and today [Thursday] is publishing three reports covering the deaths of four. All four might well have survived had they been wearing a lifejacket when they entered the water.\u201d</p> <p>Clinch said in the cold waters around the UK survival time can be measured in minutes unless a lifejacket is being worn. </p> <p>\u201cHowever, this message is not getting home despite a three-year campaign that has seen almost every commercial fisherman in the UK receive a free lifejacket,.</p> <p>\u201cEvidence from other countries shows that education campaigns alone have little effect on behaviour, but when backed by legislation the change is both significant and sustained,\u201d said Clinch, adding that all trawler crew members should wear lifejackets when working on deck at sea. </p> <p>Those who have died this year include <a href=\"http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/father-son-named-fishermen-board-11266630\">father and son Gareth and Daniel Willington, </a>whose boat Harvester grounded on rocks off Pembrokeshire, south-west Wales, in April. Daniel\u2019s body remains missing. </p> <p>The MAIB report says a likely scenario is that one of the men became entangled in a rope; the other went to his aid and both fell overboard. It adds: \u201cNeither crew member wore a personal flotation device [PFD], significantly lowering their chances of survival.\u201d</p> <p>In the same month <a href=\"https://www.thecourier.co.uk/fp/news/scotland/157690/photo-of-fisherman-missing-overboard-off-orkney-coast-released/ \">Craig Reid </a>fell from the stern of a fishing vessel called Apollo as its trawl net was being hauled in heavy seas north-west of Orkney. The water temperature was 9C. Crewmates flung a lifebuoy to him but he could not cling on to it. His body was found months later. The report says Reid was young and fit but could not survive in the cold water.</p> <p>The report adds: \u201cMAIB analysis of many similar accidents shows that in UK waters a person who falls overboard, without a lifejacket, typically loses the ability to help themselves within 10 minutes of entering the water.\u201d </p> <p>In October 2015 Gerard Gillies <a href=\"https://www.pressandjournal.co.uk/fp/news/islands/715173/tributes-paid-to-fisherman-killed-after-falling-overboard/ \">was lost overboard from the Annie T </a>in the Sound of Mingulay, at the southern edge of the Western Isles of Scotland. He is thought to have had a heart attack.</p> <p>Three working lifejackets \u2013 which had been supplied to the trawler\u2019s crew free of charge by the Scottish Fishing Federation \u2013 were still in their original packaging and had never been used. </p> <p>According to the MAIB, the likelihood of surviving an overboard incident is five times greater if a lifejacket is worn. </p> <p>By law, lifejackets have to be worn in certain circumstances in Ireland, France, Norway, Belgium, Spain, Portugal and Iceland.</p> <p>Many fishermen resist wearing lifejackets because they feel they restrict their movement as they work on deck or are uncomfortable. Some argue they can be dangerous if they snag on equipment.</p>"
