  "<p>Fatoumatah Bah is cornered. Sitting in front of a tinsel-ringed mirror in Miskaa Salon, her head is bent forward, two women at work braiding twists into her hair. She will be stuck in the chair for at least three hours.</p> <p>It is a good moment to pounce. Fatoumatah Kamara, 20, an apprentice hairdresser in a matching skirt and blouse and glinting cherry earrings, sidles up to Bah. She starts to make conversation.</p> <p>At first, it is the usual hairdresser chatter. What rain we\u2019ve been having, eh? Where are you from? What are you up to this weekend? This is the 20-year-old accountancy student\u2019s second visit to the salon in Guinea\u2019s capital, Conakry.</p> <p>Soon Kamara\u2019s questions become more personal. Does Bah have a husband? A boyfriend? Then she goes in for the kill. Does she know there are ways of avoiding getting pregnant?</p> <p>With every manicure, pedicure and hairdo at the Miskaa Salon, clients receive a free treatment: a great deal of contraceptive advice.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/datablog/2016/mar/08/contraception-and-family-planning-around-the-world-interactive\">Contraception and family planning around the world \u2013 interactive</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Five salons across Conakry have been dispensing family planning advice since 2012, and they have been so successful that the project \u2013 the brainchild of <a href=\"https://www.jhpiego.org/\">Jhpiego</a>, a health organisation associated with Johns Hopkins University in the US \u2013 is about to be extended to salons in Guinea\u2019s seven major cities.</p> <p>In Guinea, which has one of the lowest rates of modern contraceptive use in the world, women have an average of five children. According to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/datablog/2016/mar/08/contraception-and-family-planning-around-the-world-interactive\">UN figures</a>, in 2015 only 7.5% of married or cohabiting women use some form of contraception.</p> <p>A lot of effort has gone into teaching women in rural Guinea about family planning, but not so much in urban areas. A salon is an excellent place to reach them, so long as it is the right kind of salon.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s better to go where they do braids because that\u2019s what women traditionally want,\u201d says Yolande Hyjazi, Jhpiego\u2019s director in Guinea. \u201cA woman who\u2019s straightening or washing her hair has more money and more access to information.\u201d</p> <p>Across town from Miskaa, Jumelle Coiffure is trying to turn around clients as fast as possible, largely because the room is impossibly cramped. Jumelle is owned by 32-year-old twins Tata Sylla, wearing a short black and bright green wig, and her sister Mbalia, with long, heavy braids.</p> <p>\u201cThere were a lot of young women getting pregnant around here when they didn\u2019t want to, with lots of kids running after them, and I thought it would be good to teach them how to avoid that. Even my apprentices were getting pregnant,\u201d says Mbalia, making up Aminata Kouma\u2019s face just inside the salon door. Outside, a dozen girls huddle under the dripping overhang of the salon\u2019s tin roof, filing fingernails and tugging at each other\u2019s hair.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"302fe655c9bb3a56b3286e02e66788d8fd29aa41\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/302fe655c9bb3a56b3286e02e66788d8fd29aa41/0_0_5760_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An apprentice hairdresser at the Jumelle salon in Conakry shows a client different family planning methods\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An apprentice hairdresser at the Jumelle salon in Conakry shows a client different family planning methods.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kate Holt</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Kouma, 35, says she first heard about family planning at Jumelle.</p> <p>\u201cI never knew about this before coming here \u2013 they taught me how,\u201d she said. \u201cI got the injection, and since then I\u2019ve been able to control the number of children I have. I already have four and I don\u2019t want any more. My husband can\u2019t afford it, school fees are so high. There\u2019s too much suffering here. I\u2019m a housemaid, but I\u2019m out of work.\u201d</p> <p>Each salon has an army of apprentices, some of whom have worked in them for years, to cope with the intensity of the work and the number of clients. Jhpiego deliberately chose very popular salons to reach as many people as possible, and trained some of their apprentices as community health workers, to explain how to use exclusive breastfeeding to prevent pregnancy, talk about implants, sell pills and write referrals. They earn half the sale price for any pills and condoms they sell.</p> <p>The trial started in 2013, but everything had to stop for the Ebola outbreak. Like all health organisations, Jhpiego had to turn its efforts to fighting Ebola. In any case, women were not going to the salon.</p> <p>It is now back in full swing, though, and tailors\u2019 shops are the next target. \u201cThere are women that wait around all day for their dresses, trying them on,\u201d Hyjazi said. \u201cPeople are being social, hanging around. But in the tailors\u2019 shops we also have a lot of young men. Reaching men is important.\u201d</p> <p>The idea is that clients of both establishments will talk to their friends, and word will spread.</p> <p>At Miskaa, a large wedding party is getting ready.</p> <p>Apprentice hairdressers cluster around each client, carefully painting on long, black eyebrows, blow-drying hair straight, and making minute adjustments to towering, shiny headwraps.</p> <p>Kamara, pointing at her laminated booklet, has just finished explaining how to use a string of beads to track fertility. But it isn\u2019t new to Bah.</p> <p>\u201cI go on Google, I go on YouTube, I find information,\u201d she says. \u201cBut not everybody is a student like me.\u201d</p> <p>She knew about condoms and pills, but not the other methods Kamara talks about. Young people have far more access to information than previous generations, and sex is slowly becoming something that is more talked about.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"295c820aa05c9e111175a709f78a898c0d849c14\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/295c820aa05c9e111175a709f78a898c0d849c14/0_0_5760_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Young men who have come to Conakry\u2019s Miskaa Salon for cut price condoms are shown how to use them correctly by apprentice hairdresser Nene Diakit\u00e9.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Young men who have come to Miskaa Salon for cut price condoms are shown how to use them correctly by apprentice hairdresser Nene Diakit\u00e9.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kate Holt</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Traditionally, a Guinean woman would space out her children by leaving her husband and going back to her mother\u2019s house for a few years, every time she had a baby.</p> <p>\u201cNow no one is using abstinence, so everyone is using contraceptives, but no one is talking about it,\u201d Hyjazi says. \u201cMany people think that if a women is using contraceptives, it\u2019s because she has another partner. There\u2019s not a lot of open communication \u2013 even between a husband and wife using them. Many women will use the pill without telling their husbands.\u201d</p> <p>One thing is unlikely to change, though, and according to Hyjazi, it is skewing the statistics, because people doing surveys do not always do them in private. \u201cIf a woman is asked if she\u2019s using contraceptives and her mother or mother-in-law is there, she\u2019ll never say yes.\u201d</p> <p>The wedding party is almost ready. Kamara looks over each woman carefully before opening the door for them. In a few hours, they have become more glamorous and, thanks to Kamara, more contraceptive-savvy.</p> <p>\u201cI like making women beautiful \u2013 that\u2019s why I work here,\u201d says Kamara, already looking around for her next quarry.</p>",
  "<p>Voters could face more stringent identity checks and police cordons around polling stations, as part of a crackdown on electoral fraud recommended by Eric Pickles in a government-commissioned report.</p> <p>The former communities secretary was asked by David Cameron last year to examine how safeguards could be toughened up, after revelations of electoral malpractice in Tower Hamlets, east London, led to the removal of the mayor, Lutfur Rahman.</p> <p>In his report, presented to Theresa May, who has retained him as \u201canti-corruption champion\u201d, Pickles warns that unless the government makes it harder to fiddle the system, Britain\u2019s reputation for democracy could be undermined.</p> <p>\u201cOur nation has a proud heritage as the \u2018mother of parliaments\u2019, yet the worrying and covert spread of electoral fraud and state of denial by some bodies threatens that good reputation. It is time to take action to take on the electoral crooks and defend Britain\u2019s free and fair elections.\u201d</p> <p>As communities secretary, Pickles sent commissioners into Tower Hamlets when the allegations of fraud emerged. His report makes 50 recommendations, including calling for pilot schemes under which voters would be asked to bring identification with them to polling stations.</p> <p>\u201cA driving licence, passport or utility bills would not seem unreasonable to establish identity. The government may wish to pilot different methods. But the present system is unsatisfactory; perfection must not get in the way of a practical solution,\u201d it says.</p> <p>With intimidation of the public on their way to cast their votes one of the issues identified in Tower Hamlets, Pickles also says returning officers, who oversee elections, and the police, should be given powers to establish <em tabindex=\"-1\">cordons sanitaires</em> around polling stations where particular problems are identified.</p> <p>He argues that rules on the use of postal votes, which have previously been identified as ripe for fraud, should be toughened up \u2013 with party activists no longer allowed to handle them, for example, and an end to the possibility of applying for a permanent postal vote.</p> <p>Rahman was found guilty of multiple charges of corruption and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/apr/23/tower-hamlets-mayor-lutfur-rahman-found-guilty-of-electoral\">kicked out of office last year</a>. He and his allies were found to have used vote-rigging and religious intimidation through local imams to return him to power.</p> <p>Backers of the Bangladeshi-born Rahman initially dismissed the claims against him as racism; and Pickles says in future, concerns about damaging community relations must not be an excuse for failing to investigate allegations of fraud.</p> <p>\u201cThere are sometimes challenging issues over divisive community politics, but this is no excuse for failing to enforce British law and protect the integrity of our democratic process. The law must be applied equally and fairly to everyone,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The report cites evidence that pressure was put on vulnerable members of some minority ethnic communities to vote in accordance with the will of elders. \u201cThere were concerns that influence and intimidation within households may not be reported, and that state institutions had turned a blind eye to such behaviour because of \u2018politically correct\u2019 over-sensitivities about ethnicity and religion,\u201d it says.</p> <p>Pickles would like to see the National Crime Agency, which looks at organised crime, be given a remit to examine complex cases of electoral fraud.<br></p> <p>The report also condemns the Electoral Commission, the government-backed body that scrutinises polls, for straying beyond its remit. \u201cThe Electoral Commission continues to act as a commentator and lobbyist on both policy and law. Yet government should not be lobbying government. It would be clearer for electoral law and electoral policy to be determined by the Cabinet Office, subject to parliamentary scrutiny and approval.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump laid out their competing visions for the US economy in the past week, with varying degrees of detail and some surprising overlap. But the bulk of each speech was spent on the differences: Trump embraced more tenets of Republican orthodoxy and Clinton made pledges that progressives would be comforted to hear.<br></p> <h2>Tax cuts v the \u2018 Buffett rule\u2019</h2> <p>Trump proposed tax cuts for all Americans, though the terms would disproportionately benefit wealthy people. The conservative-leaning Tax Foundation found that tax revenue would fall by $2.4 tn over the first decade, and <a href=\"http://taxfoundation.org/article/details-and-analysis-2016-house-republican-tax-reform-plan\">the top 1% of Americans would make 5.3% more money </a>under the Republican plan, which would consolidate seven tax brackets into three, of 12%, 25% and 33%. Trump\u2019s new plan accepts more common Republican proposals; his <a href=\"https://www.donaldjtrump.com/positions/tax-reform\">old plan </a> would have cut the top rate to 25%. The Tax Policy Center <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/analysis-of-trumps-tax-plan-shows-big-cuts-in-taxes-federal-revenue-1450807194\">estimated</a> his plan would reduce revenue by $9.5tn over a decade and increase the deficit by 80% by 2036.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/11/hillary-clinton-infrastructure-economy-jobs-trade-deals\">Clinton: Trump's economic plan will benefit rich, mine will create 10m jobs</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Clinton, in contrast, has backed an expanded version of a proposal by billionaire investor Warren Buffett to tax the ultrarich. She proposed a \u201cfair share surcharge\u201d that would place an extra tax on people who make more than $5m a year, in an effort to close loopholes that often mean millionaires pay lower effective rates than middle-class families.</p> <h2>Corporate tax cuts v a carrot and stick</h2> <p>Corporate profits have by and large<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/05/business/economy/corporate-profits-grow-ever-larger-as-slice-of-economy-as-wages-slide.html\"> increased over the past 15 years </a>while <a href=\"http://www.epi.org/publication/understanding-the-historic-divergence-between-productivity-and-a-typical-workers-pay-why-it-matters-and-why-its-real/\">wages have stagnated</a>. Trump\u2019s plan entails a cut to the corporate tax rate, to 15% from 35%, which he argues will entice companies to return to or stay in the United States to invest and create jobs. He has also often told crowds that he will threaten companies who want to move overseas with <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/may/01/ted-cruz/donald-trumps-economic-agenda-imposing-massive-tax/\">extremely high tariffs</a>.</p> <p>Clinton offered both benefits and threats. She said she would simplify taxes for small businesses and offer tax credits to companies that share profits with employees. Her campaign has laid out <a href=\"https://www.hillaryclinton.com/briefing/h/2016-02-12-hillary-clintons-breaking-every-barrier-agenda-revitalizing-the-economy-in-communities-left-behind/\">similar benefits </a>for companies that invest in the US. But Clinton also threatened an \u201cexit tax\u201d for companies that want to move overseas, close the <a href=\"http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/briefing-book/what-carried-interest-and-how-should-it-be-taxed\">carried-interest loophole</a> and strengthen financial regulators, such as the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.</p> <h2>Repealing regulations v clean energy funds</h2> <p>In another nod toward conventional Republican ideas, Trump said he would place a moratorium on any new regulations, and he has frequently blamed environmental safety rules on the decline of the coal industry, whose market has been <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2013/04/08/study-the-coal-industry-is-in-far-more-trouble-than-anyone-realizes/\">hugely taken over by natural gas companies</a>.</p> <p>Clinton took the common Democratic path and proposed new investment in clean energy and research. She gave no real specifics in her speech but her campaign has proposed a \u201cclean energy challenge\u201d that would \u201cpartner\u201d the federal government with local counterparts to reduce pollution and invest in clean energy infrastructure.</p> <h2>Infrastructure funding</h2> <p>Clinton promised $250bn in federal infrastructure funding and a $25bn \u201cnational infrastructure bank\u201d to create jobs and rehabilitate things such as the country\u2019s roads, airports, water and electrical grids . Barack Obama <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/02/us/obama-urges-funding-for-infrastructure-projects.html\">struggled for years</a> to pass major infrastructure funding through Congress, until he finally managed to convince lawmakers to back <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/12/a-major-infrastructure-bill-clears-congress/418827/\">a five-year, $305bn plan</a> last December. Clinton has said that higher taxes on the richest and corporations would offset the spending, and gave a few specifics about her plans, including expanded broadband internet around the US.</p> <p>Trump spoke at length about deteriorating conditions of American infrastructure in his speech, and has said at many rallies that he wants to reinvest in utilities and transportation at home. But in his speech in Detroit he only spoke of infrastructure vaguely, saying: \u201cWe will build the next generation of roads, bridges, railways, tunnels, seaports and airports that our country deserves.\u201d </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/11/donald-trump-obama-founder-isis-most-valuable-player\">Trump reiterates he literally believes Barack Obama is the 'founder of Isis'</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>Trade deals and tariffs</h2> <p>Both Clinton and Trump said they would renegotiate trade deals they deem unfavorable to the US. But while the Republican has said he would start from scratch on deals, and possibly impose tariffs as high as 45% on imports from foreign companies, the Democrat said she would specifically stop \u201cany trade deal that kills jobs or holds down wages, including the Trans Pacific Partnership\u201d.</p> <p>She also said she would appoint \u201ca chief trade prosecutor, triple the number of enforcement officers, and when countries break the rules we won\u2019t hesitate to impose targeted tariffs\u201d \u2013 a less protectionist stance than Trump, yet sharing some of his philosophy about penalties directed at foreign corporations.</p> <h2>The \u2018death tax\u2019</h2> <p>Trump called for the repeal of the estate tax, a fine levied on wealthy inheritors that <a href=\"http://www.cbpp.org/research/ten-facts-you-should-know-about-the-federal-estate-tax\">affects about 0.2% of all Americans</a>, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, as the tax exempts the first $5.45m a person inherits. Clinton would leave the estate tax as law.</p> <h2>Families and childcare</h2> <p>Trump called for \u201callowing parents to fully deduct the average cost of childcare spending from their taxes\u201d, which would benefit most families with moderate to significant childcare costs but not low-income families, who would have the least to deduct, and who by definition, pay less in federal income taxes. His campaign has said he also supports a \u201ccredit to stay-at-home caregivers\u201d and an exemption on childcare expenses from half of payroll taxes.</p> <p>Clinton has proposed tax credits, subsidized childcare and increased pay for childcare workers \u2013 expensive proposals that she says will be offset by increased taxes and closed loopholes. She said she wants to limit the cost of childcare to 10% of family income, and to expand social security.</p> <h2>Higher education</h2> <p>Trump has largely ignored the issue of higher education, though he has bemoaned the high debts that many young Americans shoulder. In his speech, he merely said: \u201clikewise, our education reforms will help parents send their kids to a school of their choice,\u201d an allusion to supporting the repeal of federal education standards at the grade and high school levels. His party\u2019s official platform supports privatizing student loans, saying: \u201cthe federal government should not be in the business of originating student loans\u201d.</p> <p>Clinton said she would \u201cliberate millions of people who already have student debt by making it easier to refinance and pay what you owe as a portion of your income\u201d. She also advocated for federal support for trade schools and \u201chigh-quality union training programs\u201d, and tax credits to companies that offer paid apprenticeships.</p> <p>Earlier this summer her campaign<a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/onpolitics/2016/07/06/hillary-clinton-college-tuition-sanders/86745342/\"> compromised with Bernie Sanders</a>, and agreed to support a plan that would eliminate tuition costs for four-year state colleges, for families who make less than $125,000 a year.</p>",

Cycling road races turn on the whims of the peloton or the mechanical sturdiness of one\u2019s bike. Any of the top 15 fencers can medal on a given day.<br></p> <p>This is not one of those events. The all-around is akin to weightlifting, in which only a handful of athletes will even attempt a medal-winning performance. Difficulty is a big part of the scoring, so if you\u2019re only the 12th-best gymnast in the world, you have to hit all your own routines while hoping the seven to eight people trying more difficult routines flop on the mat.</p> <p>The top non-American gymnast in qualifying was from the home country \u2013 Brazil\u2019s Rebeca Andrade. She\u2019ll have a legitimate shot at the podium, but the two Russians behind her, Seda Tutkhalian and Aliya Mustafina, are capable as well. </p> <p>But this is, in the most literal sense, the Americans\u2019 event to lose. Consider the qualifying score: Simone Biles 62.366, Aly Raisman 60.607, Andrade 58.732. Those are larger margins than they appear \u2013 the gap from third to 30th was smaller than gap from first to third. </p> <p>If you\u2019re in the United States and don\u2019t want the results spoiled before you see them on NBC tonight, you\u2019ll have to stop reading now. Better yet, just open up the live stream in another browser window. Choose the general \u201cwomen\u2019s all-around final\u201d stream to get the lively commentary \u2013 not the same stuff you\u2019ll hear tonight on NBC, but some entertaining and informative former Olympians Jonathan Horton and Courtney Kupets Carter.

  "<p><em>Update: Facebook and Adblock have taken turns unblocking and reblocking ads on the social network. This is likely to continue until one of them cries uncle. Check back with us in a month or two for more updates. (Just kidding.)</em><br></p> <p>Two days ago, Facebook announced it had implemented changes to its site <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/aug/09/facebook-adblockers-desktop-browser\">that would thwart ad blockers</a>. Users who wanted to enjoy the world\u2019s largest social network would continue to pay by seeing ads keyed to their Likes and web-browsing habits. </p> <p>Now popular browser plugin Adblock Plus has returned fire, issuing a filter update that restores its commercial-killing powers to the world of Zuckerberg. </p> <p>Game on.</p> <p>In <a href=\"https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2016/08/a-new-way-to-control-the-ads-you-see-on-facebook-and-an-update-on-ad-blocking/\">a blog post dated 9 August,</a> Facebook vice-president Andrew Bosworth announced that ad blockers would no longer make \u201csponsored posts\u201d disappear on desktop and laptop computers. However, in an apparently magnanimous gesture, Facebook would allow users <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/ads/preferences\">more control over the types of ads</a> they would see. </p> <p>Said Bosworth:<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> If you don\u2019t want to see ads about a certain interest like travel or cats, you can remove the interest from your ad preferences. We also heard that people want to be able to stop seeing ads from businesses or organizations who have added them to their customer lists, and so we are adding tools that allow people to do this.</p> </blockquote> <p>Adblock Plus vowed its community of ad-loathing users would not take those changes sitting down. In a blog post on Thursday, it announced <a href=\"https://adblockplus.org/blog/fb-reblock-ad-blocking-community-finds-workaround-to-facebook\">an update to its filters that would restore the plugin\u2019s ad-blocking powers</a> to the world\u2019s biggest social network. Users can either update the plug in by clicking a button or manually add the filter code to the software.</p> <p>According to the Adblock blog:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>As many of you know, the filter lists that \u2018tell\u2019 Adblock Plus what to block are in fact the product of a global community of web citizens. This time that community seems to have gotten the better of even a giant like Facebook.</p> </blockquote> <p>Facebook claims the Adblock plugin also blocks non-advertising posts from users\u2019 friends. <br></p> <p> \u201cWe\u2019re disappointed that ad blocking companies are punishing people on Facebook as these new attempts don\u2019t just block ads but also posts from friends and Pages,\u201d says a Facebook spokesperson. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a good experience for people and we plan to address the issue. Ad blockers are a blunt instrument, which is why we\u2019ve instead focused on building tools like ad preferences to put control in people\u2019s hands.\u201d </p> <p>The social network also takes exception to Adblock\u2019s policy of taking money from some of the web\u2019s largest advertisers \u2013 including Google \u2013 to \u201cwhitelist\u201d adverts that follow its guidelines for \u201cacceptable ads\u201d. (This setting is turned on by default, but can be changed by people who wish to see no ads at all.)</p> <p>One of the rules advertisers must follow is that \u201cads must not disrupt the user\u2019s natural reading flow\u201d, and be placed to the side, above or below the \u201cprimary content\u201d. Another is that ads can be clearly distinguished from non-ad content. </p> <p>Sponsored content features prominently in the center of Facebook\u2019s newsfeed, which would hamper the network\u2019s ability to adhere to those guidelines, if it chose to.</p> <p>An estimated <a href=\"https://pagefair.com/blog/2015/ad-blocking-report/\">198 million netizens use some form of ad blocker</a>, according to Page Fair. That number is expected to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/may/17/adblockers-us-growth-remove-12bn-advertising-2020\">triple over the next five years. </a> </p> <p>Adblock is under no illusions that its respite from Facebook\u2019s ire will be anything more than temporary.</p> <p>\u201c[T]his sort of back-and-forth battle between the open source ad-blocking community and circumventers has been going on since ad-blocking was invented; so it\u2019s very possible that Facebook will write some code that will render the filter useless \u2013 at any time ... But for this round of the cat-and-mouse contest, looks like the mouse won.\u201d</p>",

Smith says he does not need to be a mind reader because Corbyn had opposed the EU for 30 years.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>During the referendum you seemed to have undergone a Damascene conversion.</p> </blockquote> <h2>Gender equality</h2> <p>Labour have just selected four men as candidates for regional mayoral elections next May and both candidates were quizzed on what the party could do to ensure greater gender equality. </p> <p>Particularly, both were asked if there should have been some all women shortlists for the mayoral selection processes. </p> <p>Corbyn says he believes it was not the leader\u2019s job to decide on AWS for regional mayors, which should be up to the local party.</p> <p>Smith, however, said he as party leader would have insisted on at least one all women shortlist. </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The party leader should have insist on one of those [mayoralties], at least, being an all woman shortlist.</p> </blockquote> <h2>Leadership</h2> <p>Smith\u2019s key argument in areas where both men seemed to agree in principle was about leadership and the electibility of the party. </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>All of the policies we want to put in place all of the principles we hold dear are worth nought because we will not be able to translate any of that into power.</p> </blockquote> <p>Corbyn, whose team have launched a rebuttal website this evening to challenge claims he is not successful electorally, said Smith was ignoring the huge surge in membership under his leadership. </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Owen, our party is a strong party, our party is a big party, our campaigning abilities are immense if we work together on those campaign.</p> </blockquote> <p>But Smith said the current tactics were reminiscent of the time the party was out of power for 18 years. </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We\u2019ve had mass rallies, we\u2019ve had a big party and we\u2019ve lost successive elections. We know how this one ends, Jeremy, and it doesn\u2019t end well for the working people of Britain. It\u2019s not about the t-shirts we wear and the badges on our lapels.</p> </blockquote> <p>\u201cI think people should wear the t-shirs they want to,\u201d responded Corbyn, calmly.</p> <h2>Defence</h2> <p>Corbyn says we must have a foreign policy \u201cbased on human rights, international law, so we become known as a force that is determined to make sure the universal declaration is enforced in all places\u201d.</p> <p>He says he would aim to eventually lower defence spending, below the 2% of GDP that Nato asks its members to spend. Later, in a discussion about whether he would ever support military action, Corbyn said he would never rule out the possibility, but said there had to be better checks and balances.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The Chilcott report makes pretty sobering reading.. how we ended up in a war we knew was questionably legal.. We have to have a different, less aggressive foreign policy.</p> </blockquote> <p>Smith says he would maintain 2%. </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We live in a more volatile world... when I see the prospect of Donald Trump in power in America, when I see Vladimir Putin in charge in Russia, I don\u2019t think now is a time for Britain to shirk its responsibilities.</p> </blockquote> <p>That\u2019s all from me tonight, thank you for reading and for your comments. </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57acdc48e4b0fe7550974ec5\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/frances-perraudin\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-11T20:17:45.525Z\">9.17pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>My colleague Frances Perraudin has been chatting to supporters and audience members both before and after the debate.

So far police have no information to suggest that Driver was working with any accomplices. </p> <p>Police refused to say where the taxi was heading.  Driver had asked the cab to take him to a shopping mall in London, located near the city\u2019s main bus and train stations.</p> <p> \u201cIf he had gotten out of that residence before we got there, the scenario would have ended a lot differently. I\u2019m positive of that,\u201d Strachan said.<br></p> <p>Authorities in Canada first flagged Driver in 2014. He was arrested in June of last year after communicating with prominent Isis supporters in the UK and US. Concerned that Driver might be a threat to public safety, a provincial court imposed several conditions on him, including a ban on possessing firearms and explosives and from accessing social media as well as reporting twice a month to the RCMP. </p> <p>His lawyer, Leonard Tailleur, said he was shocked to hear of Wednesday\u2019s events. \u201cHe was a very passive individual.

  "<p>It wasn\u2019t until my young daughter asked why Sam Newman was calling me and the rest of The Outer Sanctum\u2019s podcasters \u201cexcrement\u201d on national television that the full impact of our role in the Eddie McGuire\u2013Caroline Wilson controversy struck me. This followed the drowning \u201cjoke\u201d made by McGuire during the Triple M coverage of the MND Big Freeze. </p> <p>As one sixth of the all-female podcast (comprising Kate Seear, Felicity Race, Lucy Race, Emma Race, and Alicia Sometimes and myself) that broke the story the weekend before The Footy Show aired, I\u2019d been largely bemused by the furore that followed. There were six of us, for a start, and we\u2019d become fast friends over the months that led to the formation of The Outer Sanctum, cemented more recently by the almost out-of-body experience of being part of a viral media storm. We had each other\u2019s back. We checked in and supported each other throughout the ensuing chaos, sharing the media responsibilities and personal missives that flooded in \u2013 the interviews, the Twitter feed, the barrage of emails and Facebook messages \u2013 divvying them up according to whose work and family commitments at that moment were manageable, and whose were not. It had been a team effort from start to finish and reminded me, again, how resilient and rewarding this collaboration had been.<br></p> <p>But seeing Sam Newman\u2019s comments through the eyes of my 12-year-old daughter was confronting and unexpectedly upsetting. My daughter was horrified, but also confused. In her world, adults don\u2019t speak like that about other people \u2013 but here was a man, a total stranger, calling her mother a piece of shit. On national television. </p> <p>I quickly turned Sam Newman and his \u201cperfumed excrement\u201d monologue off. But it shook me. It shook us all.</p> <p>I will not pretend that The Outer Sanctum team were ever fans of The Footy Show. As a podcast that focuses on AFL, we feel an obligation to be across the mainstream and independent footy media, and although the ratings have slumped over the years, The Footy Show still attracts big-name players and has a prominent place on prime-time TV \u2013 albeit an unwarranted one, considering the ratings and the casual disregard for football content. (Particularly when you consider the long-running, thoughtful and entertaining Marngrook Footy Show<em> </em>broadcast on NITV.)</p> <p>We view The Footy Show as a necessary evil, and so we take turns watching it. Whoever performs this task generally suffers for the first 20 or 30 minutes, before they are free to turn it off. Duty performed, job done. </p> <p>That was how we felt about the show <em>before</em> Sam Newman called us \u201csecond-tier\u201d media, and perfumed excrement. For the record, this is what he said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> If you search for a cause to fit a narrative that you are peddling, eventually you will convince yourself that you have stumbled onto something, as most of the cowardly excrement have.</p> <p> Those excrement who have weighed into this, I would like to mention their names but as no one reads, watches or listens to them because they are in second-tier media outlets I won\u2019t bother.</p> <p> But if you spray a piece of excrement with perfume or put aftershave on a piece of excrement, at the end of the day it is still a piece of excrement.</p> </blockquote> <p> That night, as the team became aware of his comments, we turned to our phones, checking in with each other, registering our shock and disbelief \u2013 and also the predictability. We were treading on privileged and typically all-male turf, and the incumbents were unlikely to roll over without a fight. So we SMSed and DMed a flurry of reassurances, missives and, thankfully, jokes, because that was what had brought us together in the first place. The thing that had forged this powerful bond: laughter. Even in the height of the madness we could make each other laugh \u2013 and I remember thinking, thank God there are six of us. </p> <p>But I also worried that Erin Riley, <a href=\"http://erinriley.com.au/archives/2912\">whose blog about our podcast</a> had sent the social media world into overdrive, was operating under her own name. This made her a wider, more vulnerable target for the indolent trolls who wouldn\u2019t deign to investigate who The Outer Sanctum members actually were. As it turned out, ever the professional, Erin refused to kowtow to the abuse, conducting interviews on mainstream and independent media, and delving deeper into the issue in follow-up articles despite an onslaught of personalised attacks. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2580fb63eff382b3498e79a19cdcdc2b601179fd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2580fb63eff382b3498e79a19cdcdc2b601179fd/0_172_4394_2635/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Broadcaster Eddie McGuire\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Eddie McGuire participates in the Freeze MND slide at the Melbourne Cricket Ground on 13 June.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Adam Trafford/AFL Media/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A week earlier, when we recorded the now infamous Episode 14, the prospect of coming under the belligerent gaze of an angry Sam Newman wasn\u2019t even on our radar. The week had been unlike any other for The Outer Sanctum \u2013 for all women, I\u2019d wager, but for entirely different reasons. That Wednesday, the AFL launched the inaugural women\u2019s league, an event we\u2019d watched live with genuine excitement and anticipation. Finally, <em>finally</em>, we were seeing the AFL acknowledge the importance of women\u2019s footy \u2013 not just to the women who play, the girls who want to, or even those never allowed to, but also, significantly, its importance for the future of the AFL (I\u2019d argue, for the future of sport in this nation).</p> <p>It was long overdue, but it was happening \u2013 and the momentum was building. The AFL community seemed genuinely pumped about this development, which was why we\u2019d deemed it the focus of this episode. That is, until our planning meeting that morning. </p> <p>Every week, half an hour before we record the show, we gather at Lucy Race\u2019s house to discuss the issues we want to include in the day\u2019s episode. On this day, Kate Seear, our sixth member, had work commitments, and we were joking about how the show would be shorter without (the ever thoughtful and articulate) Dr Seear around. Then Lucy showed us the MSN article criticising the comments about Caroline Wilson made by Eddie McGuire, Danny Frawley and James Brayshaw, and there was a decided shift in the room.</p> <p>In case you haven\u2019t seen or heard them yet:</p> <p><strong> McGuire:</strong> In fact I reckon we should start the campaign for a one-person slide next year. Caroline Wilson. And I\u2019ll put in 10 grand straight away \u2013 make it 20. [laughter] And if she stays under, 50. [laughter] What do you reckon guys? Who else is up there? I know you\u2019re in JB?</p> <p><strong> James Brayshaw:</strong> No, yep. Straight in.</p> <p><strong> Danny Frawley:</strong> I\u2019ll be in amongst it Ed.</p> <p><strong> McGuire:</strong> Is Duck there?</p> <p><strong> Wayne Carey:</strong> Yes, I\u2019m here mate.</p> <p><strong> McGuire: </strong>Duck\u2019s in. Danny\u2019s in \u2013 already spoken up.</p> <p><strong> Frawley:</strong> Yeah I\u2019m in Ed.</p> <p><strong> McGuire:</strong> I could do an auction here today.</p> <p><strong> Frawley:</strong> I\u2019ll actually jump in and make sure she doesn\u2019t \u2013 I\u2019ll hold her under, Ed.</p> <p><strong> McGuire:</strong> I reckon we could charge ten thousand for everyone to stand around the outside and bomb her.</p> <p><strong> Damien Barrett:</strong> I\u2019m on Caro\u2019s side now, Ed. I\u2019m on Caro\u2019s side these days, Ed.</p> <p> [indecipherable]</p> <p><strong> McGuire: </strong>She\u2019ll burn you like everyone else, mate. She\u2019s like the black widow. She just sucks you in and gets you and you start talking to her and then <em>bang</em>! She gets you.</p> <p><strong> Brayshaw:</strong> If you ran that auction from down there, I reckon you\u2019d start grabbing some bids out of the seats too. There\u2019d be money piling in everywhere</p> <p><strong> McGuire:</strong> It\u2019ll be magnificent. I think we should do that next year. It\u2019s all good for footy.</p> <p><strong> Brayshaw: </strong>Bloody oath.</p> <p>We decided, unanimously, that we\u2019d talk about McGuire\u2019s comments on the show. This was exactly the kind of issue that The Outer Sanctum team cared about most deeply \u2013 our <em>raison d\u2019\u00eatre</em>. The only question that arose, the only hesitation in covering it, was whether it had actually happened, because we could find no other coverage of the comments anywhere else. It seemed impossible that such provocative and controversial language from high-profile personalities \u2013 commentators of the game, but also two club presidents \u2013 could slip by the mainstream media unreported. But we investigated, established their veracity, and included it in our run sheet.</p> <p>Importantly, we didn\u2019t open with this story. We were reluctant to dampen the excitement we all felt around the women\u2019s league announcement, the glow of seeing women in AFL guernseys featured in an AFL broadcast still warm on our cheeks. But we also understood the Triple M incident could not pass unchecked.</p> <p>We went into some detail about which clubs secured teams, the surprises, the disappointments, as well as the individuals involved in the process, which led, quite naturally, to the comments Eddie McGuire had made about Caroline Wilson. If you <a href=\"http://www.outersanctum.com.au/#!Podcast-14/zzlhx/576242f70cf235a69b2369e6\">listen to our podcast, you can hear a slight tremor in Lucy\u2019s voice</a> as she describes the language he used. We all felt shaken by it. Confronted and offended, but also hurt. </p> <p> It is worth listening all the way through the Triple M segment. Too often ignored is that, after the commentary team leaves McGuire, you can hear Wayne Carey quickly remove himself from the \u201cteam bid\u201d, the moment he understood what had just transpired: \u201cJust to clarify, when he [Eddie] said, \u2018Duck, are you in?\u2019 I thought he meant would I go down the slide\u2026 [I\u2019m] not in on the bid on Caroline.\u201d</p> <p> If Carey, a former footballer who has previously been accused of violence against women, and has on one occasion been convicted of indecent assault, could identify the toxicity of the \u201cbanter\u201d, then surely it should have been obvious to a media-savvy, highly influential broadcasting professional like McGuire.</p> <p>In our discussion, each of us had concerns with the content, the tone and the generally ugly stacks-on mentality of the segment. We expressed surprise and disappointment that the commentary \u201cwas disrespectful to\u201d a very worthy event \u2013 a Motor Neurone Disease awareness campaign \u2013 as well as at the hypocrisy that McGuire and company would \u201cfall over themselves\u201d to help Geelong footballer Jimmy Bartel raise awareness around family violence in his excellent #FaceUpToDV campaign, and yet joke about drowning a female colleague. </p> <p>We were particularly concerned that it had the potential to ruin what was a momentous week for women\u2019s footy. We finished the episode with an interview with Bridget Barker, who had headed North Melbourne\u2019s (unsuccessful) bid for a women\u2019s team. The podcast went live the next day, Friday. On Saturday night, Erin Riley, a listener of The Outer Sanctum, contacted us about the McGuire comments and our take on it, then put together her article headlined <a href=\"http://erinriley.com.au/archives/2912\">Eddie McGuire, Caroline Wilson, and violence against women: the AFL must act</a>, which promptly went viral. Social media backed the blog and the podcast via Twitter and, with the support of fellow podcasters at The Footy Gospel, as well as encouragement and advice from Fairfax journalist and excellent human Andrew Stafford, by Monday it was front-page news and the central conversation point for mainstream and social media around the country. There were reports as far flung as the United Kingdom, and as it was only a couple of weeks out from the federal election, questions about McGuire\u2019s comments even permeated the prime minister\u2019s campaign.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"734ae95ca5a1c5587f62a2f5bcb19a0364dcc3dc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/734ae95ca5a1c5587f62a2f5bcb19a0364dcc3dc/0_77_2469_1481/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Eddie McGuire leaves Collingwood football club\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Eddie McGuire leaves the Collingwood\u2019s headquarters on Tuesday, 20 June, having been backed to continue as the club\u2019s president.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tracey Nearmy/AAP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p> For the most part, commentators recognised that the comments were out of order, and understood they represented a larger, more complex social issue surrounding casual sexism and the evidential correlation between misogynistic language and violence against women. However, there was also a significant proportion of the community who criticised Caroline Wilson for \u201cbringing it on herself\u201d, due to the robustness of her particular style of journalism. Journalism, it must be noted, that has won awards and broken stories that have changed the sport, arguably forever. </p> <p>When you unpack this criticism \u2013 the scale of it, the language employed and the vitriol underlying it \u2013 it provides yet another example of the consistently gendered response saved for female journalists. This point has played out in many forums over the years, but most recently, and most relevant to the Australian media landscape, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/apr/12/the-dark-side-of-guardian-comments\">was the research carried out by The<em> </em>Guardian into the nature of its own comments thread</a>, which demonstrated, categorically, \u201cthat articles written by women attract more abuse and dismissive trolling than those written by men, regardless of what the article is about\u201d.</p> <p>In an even clearer demonstration of how to miss the point, much of the attention, when it finally came, focused on the personalities involved. That Eddie McGuire and, to a lesser degree, <a href=\"http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/sport/afl/its-time-for-eddie-mcguire-to-go/news-story/a411fb1c4dc5a2ca2b48dced8af5ae4a\">Danny Frawley</a>, had form in using divisive and problematic language in the past only aggravated the situation, as too many claimed the problem lies with McGuire, Frawley, and Brayshaw, or even Triple M, rather than the system and society itself. At one point, the entire debate seemed stuck on whether these men should be removed from their posts \u2013 as if that would present some kind of solution \u2013 rather than acknowledging that the issue is bigger than any of these individuals, and more complex. Indeed, that it reaches beyond footy, beyond sport, extending well into the reaches of broader society \u2013 including the media itself.</p> <p>This point was exemplified by the ever predictable Murdoch columnist Andrew Bolt, who demonstrated the pervasiveness of the very issue at play when he <a href=\"http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/opinion/andrew-bolt/andrew-bolt-lets-call-out-the-real-sexists-in-eddie-mcguire-drowning-scandal-emirates/news-story/dff7780d16e045e1720caaf0ccda7a55\">referred to the women of The Outer Sanctum and Erin Riley as \u201cmummy bloggers\u201d</a>, opining that <em>our</em> commentary was sexist itself: \u201cthe outrage machine \u2013 the likes of Rosie Batty, the huffpuffing <em>Age</em> and the mummy bloggers \u2013 are making far too much of McGuire\u2019s joke\u2026\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMummy blogger\u201d is itself a deeply problematic and loaded term, reflecting a sexist view that carries with it an accusation of amateurism and inferiority due to gender and the (incorrect) presumption that women of a certain age are invariably mothers and therefore <em>not</em> professional. Moreover, though, his comments indicate a total lack of research \u2013 the very foundation of quality journalism. Rather than uncovering whom \u201cthe outrage machine\u201d might comprise, he simply writes us off as aspirants and amateurs, gendering this dismissiveness to boot. What is the likelihood that Bolt would refer to six men producing a podcast about AFL as \u201cdaddy bloggers\u201d? Further, it echoes the implication underlying Sam Newman\u2019s \u201csecond-tier media\u201d and \u201cexcrement\u201d attack, that only certain people are entitled to speak (first-tier media?) and that those people already control the microphone.</p> <p>For the record, the \u201cmummy bloggers\u201d Bolt refused to rate include award-winning broadcaster, producer and entrepreneur <a href=\"https://twitter.com/emsyanna?lang=en\">Emma Race</a>, who has more than 15 years\u2019 experience in commercial and community radio and TV. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/aliciasometimes?lang=en\">Alicia Sometimes</a> is a poet, writer and broadcaster who has produced and presented media across commercial and community networks for almost two decades, most recently co-editing an anthology of footy stories featuring some of Australia\u2019s most highly regarded writers and thinkers. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/FelicityCG?lang=en\">Felicity Race</a> and Lucy Race jointly run a business and each have more than a decade\u2019s experience in marketing and communications, respectively. Academic and practising lawyer Dr Kate Seear\u2019s curriculum vitae would fill pages \u2013 suffice to say, she is an expert in the intersections between drug and alcohol use, gender, family violence and the law, and had (incidentally) spent the days before the podcast broadcast reading the Royal Commission on Family Violence\u2019s 1,900-page report for an academic paper she was co-authoring on the subject.</p> <p>Guests of The Outer Sanctum have included, among others, award-winning sports journalist Sam Lane; first out (male) AFL footballer and LGBTIQ activist Jason Ball; federal sex discrimination commissioner Kate Jenkins; Marngrook Footy Show panellist and Indigenous activist Shelley Ware; the first female AFL club president, Peggy O\u2019Neal; Bulldogs vice-president Dr Susan Alberti; the AFL\u2019s first female goal umpire to officiate a grand final, Chelsea Roffey; and, as a direct result of this controversy, an extended conversation with Caroline Wilson, which we included in the follow-up episode.</p> <p>Also, none of us blog. </p> <p><a href=\"http://erinriley.com.au/home\">Erin Riley</a>, whose post about the issue went viral, is a highly regarded journalist who has written for Guardian Australia, The Age<em>,</em> Sydney Morning Herald, and The Drum, among others, and has written widely about sport, politics and gender. At least she could, in fairness, be referred to as a blogger, given she also writes a blog. But based on that definition, so too could Andrew Bolt. (The circularity and hypocrisy of Bolt\u2019s argument is truly dizzying.)</p> <p>While none of us had the slightest notion of the scale of controversy our podcast would engender, when we first formed The Outer Sanctum we knew it would give voice to stories not ordinarily heard. The point was to have fun while creating a safe and welcoming space for everyone; but mostly, we wanted to discuss the issues that matter to us, as women, as parents, as people \u2013 though always, ultimately, as fans of the game. </p> <p>This was our position prior to that first episode, and remains our position today.</p> <p>Incredibly, the effect of the episode and the ensuing fallout seems to be lasting. In the immediate aftermath of the story, the Victoria Police released a memo reminding members of the power of language and the role it plays in enabling a culture of violence. Holden reconsidered its sponsorship of the Collingwood Football Club, deciding in the end to redirect a significant portion of the funds to support women\u2019s football at Collingwood. In response to Newman\u2019s comments, there are reports that Nissan\u2019s sponsorship of The Footy Show is in doubt, and the AFL has invited anti-violence advocates Our Watch to present at the next AFL presidents and CEOs\u2019 meeting on the prevention of violence against women and children. The invitation referred directly to the McGuire comments, which, according to commissioner Mike Fitzpatrick, \u201cshow how much more work there is to be done\u201d. The Richmond Football Club players took it upon themselves to boycott Triple M\u2019s coverage that week and McGuire publicly apologised \u201cunreservedly\u201d, and to Caroline Wilson privately (albeit after some delay and on a third attempt), before taking an extended leave of absence from the media. As a result, reporter Sarah Jones debuted as anchor for Fox Footy.</p> <p>Perhaps more poignant, though, are the countless anecdotes shared by people we know and people we don\u2019t about how they\u2019re rethinking the way they address each other, and how they use language. People who are asking questions and seeking feedback in the hope of ensuring that what they want to say reflects what is actually heard. This, more than anything, is the measure of how far we\u2019ve come. At the very least, I hope it will mean I never again have to explain to my daughter why a complete stranger would call her mum perfumed excrement on national television.</p> <p><em>This essay was published in partnership with <a href=\"https://griffithreview.com/\">Griffith Review</a> to coincide with the <a href=\"https://griffithreview.com/editions/our-sporting-life/\">Our sporting life edition</a></em></p>",
  "<p>This endearing if unabashedly hokey biopic recounts the uplifting story of Mohammed Assaf (played as a child by angelic Kais Attalah; as an adult by a more angular Tawfeek Barhom).

His journey, as they like to call it on shows like this, was a rocky one, full of the hardship and heartbreak you\u2019d expect.

He is listening to the criminal and not the victims. If he is paying money to this man, it is an even bigger mistake because they are rewarding him, since it will encourage others to try blackmail. It is a very dangerous precedent. It will encourage others to do the same.\u201d</p> <p>Jodran agreed at the end of January to reopen the oil terminals after his meeting with Kobler, who was the mediator of the deal.</p> <p>Despite its official-sounding title, the Petroleum Facilities Guard (PFG) is seen by the head of the oil corporation as little more than a militia and extortion racket. The PFG had been demanding back payments in return for reopening the three oil terminals under his control.</p> <p>\u201cJodran has been responsible overall for the loss of $100bn in revenue so he has been responsible for almost all the problems in the country \u2013 the devaluation of the dinar\u2019s value, the 400% inflation, the lack of food, the long queues in front of the banks, the lack of medicine in the hospitals,\u201d said Sanalla. </p> <p>\u201cLibyans rely on oil. It represents 98% of the revenue of the government, and this man holds the country hostage for three years so he and his allies can control the National Oil Corporation. He is a curse on the country</p> <p>\u201cI am not a politician, nor a diplomat, I am an engineer, but I have told Kobler [he has] have contaminated the name of the UN inside Libya.\u201d</p> <p>Despite being assured that the deal did not include any improper payments, Sanalla said the precise details needed to be published. \u201cIf there was a deal, all the payments should be transparent and under the control of the legitimate monitoring bodies in the Libyan state,\u201d he said. \u201cOil terminals must be reopened without any payoff and only through official channels.\u201d</p> <p>The controversy shows that, although the recent focus in Libya has been on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/02/us-bombing-libya-isis-strongholds-vicious-cycle\">the US-backed liberation of Sirte from Islamic State control</a>, the political battle to reunite the divided country and revive oil production, the lifeblood of the Libyan economy, remains critical.</p> <p>The country is dogged by rivalry between the UN-backed government in Tripoli and its rival in the east \u2013 as well as numerous other militia and tribal rivalries. \u201cThere are factions that block oil production in the oil fields, vandals that threaten to destroy or metre the flow of oil through valves along the pipelines, and militia that blockade the oil ports of the Libyan crescent,\u201d Sanalla said. </p> <p>He said he was working with all the groups to try to end the blockades but that required a wider political agreement about how the revenues will be distributed.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7521bdeb85df9d993c65272665ff77595a0b5fcc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7521bdeb85df9d993c65272665ff77595a0b5fcc/0_239_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Smoke\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Smoke rises after an airstrike as Libyan forces allied with the UN-backed government fought Islamic State for Sirte.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Before the country descended into chaos, Libya was producing 1.6m barrels a day and Sanalla had planned to produce 2.1m barrels a day by 2017. Storage capacity at the ports should be 6m barrels but violence has seen that figure fall to only 750,000.</p> <p>The oil chief\u2019s revived plans, dependent on the restoration of security, the reopening of closed oil fields in the west and government investment, could see production rise from 216,000 barrels per day (bpd) to 500,000 per day by the end of the month and then 900,000 by the end of the year. </p> <p>Without a minimum of 800,000 bpd, Libya is unlikely to be able to pay salaries, invest in much-needed infrastructure or maintain its economy.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/02/us-bombing-libya-isis-strongholds-vicious-cycle\">The US is bombing Libya again. It's a too-familiar vicious cycle | Trevor Timm</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Sanalla warned that the apparent fall of Sirte may mean displaced Islamic State forces would seek to sabotage thinly guarded oil installations in the rest of the country. \u201cWe do not know where they will go but they have attacked the oil fields before. It is a concern.\u201d</p> <p>He is equally concerned that the PFG and their Libyan National Army rivals may fight for control of the Zueitina oil terminal, one of the three central ports controlled by the PFG. \u201cThere are 4m barrels in that area and, if there is a fire in that area, there will be a disaster. I am urging everyone to keep the area safe.\u201d Six western governments issued a statement on Wednesday urging all sides to avoid a battle for the terminal. </p> <p>For the longer term, Sanalla is working on a range of security plans for the oil fields, including one in which an inner circle is protected by a force run by the private oil companies and the outer circle controlled by a revamped PFG. Another option is to use a revamped army, but that requires a political reconciliation so a single government can operate.</p> <p>\u201cMy frustration is that this country can be, and was, so wealthy. The country has descended into poverty and we cannot send money to the treasury. The deficit last year was 40bn dinars \u2013 all because of the oil blockade designed to support one militia or another.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 15 August 2016 to correct the first name of the head of the UN\u2019s mission in Libya, Martin Kobler.</p>",

The suit demands unspecified compensatory damages.</p> <p>According to the complaint, Phillip \u201cproduced a pistol, put his right index finger on the trigger, and drove the barrel into Vincent\u2019s knee cap\u201d during a car trip to check on volunteers in Greenville, South Carolina in February:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Phillip pushed the barrel into Vincent\u2019s knee. The barrel\u2019s pressure crinkled Vincent\u2019s blue jeans. Phillip ominously stared sidewise at Vincent while driving the Jeep down the road and the barrel into Vincent. Vincent froze. Phillip\u2019s gun was loaded and the safety was off. A bump in the road would likely result in a bullet hole, and worse, in Vincent\u2019s knee.</p> </blockquote> <p>Bordini\u2019s suit said that he reported the incident to the campaign\u2019s western North Carolina regional director, who said that the same thing had happened to him. Next, Bordini said, he informed the Trump campaign\u2019s national field director, and later had a phone conversation with then-campaign manager Corey Lewandowski - neither of whom, Bordini said, did anything.</p> <p>Phillip left the campaign last week.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57ac947fe4b0f231200d9f27\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-11T15:24:10.263Z\">4.24pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>A <a href=\"http://www.publicpolicypolling.com/pdf/2015/PPP_Release_SC_81116.pdf\">new poll from Public Policy Polling</a> shows Donald Trump leading Hillary Clinton in blood-red South Carolina by a mere two points, another indication that the Republican nominee\u2019s campaign is in serious trouble.</p> <p>Trump leads Clinton 41% to 39%, with Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson pulling 5% and Green candidate Jill Stein at 2%.

Everything matched up with the matrix, I followed the protocols I was supposed to, and everything was supported by the matrix. There was a constant pressure on the island to downgrade the severity of incidents.\u201d</p> <p>Gunn <a href=\"https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2016/06/07/Sub_068.pdf\">raised his concerns about downgrading in a submission</a> to an Australian <a href=\"http://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Committees/Senate/Regional_processing_Nauru\">Senate committee inquiry into conditions and circumstances in detention on Nauru</a>. </p> <p>In its response to his concerns in the Senate Wilson Security\u2019s executive general manager, south Pacific, John Rogers, wrote: \u201c<a href=\"https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2016/06/07/Sub_068_Response_by_Wilson_Security_(1).pdf\">Wilson Security ensures that all incident reporting is carried out in strict accordance with the relevant guideline</a>.

They de-escalate to majors, and the majors de-escalate to minors, and there\u2019s a whole number of incidents that de-escalate to no particular incident, so they\u2019re not classified as anything at all. All along the line, incidents are de-escalated for the purpose \u2026 of avoiding extremely heavy fines under their contract.\u201d</p> <p>Stevenson said the de-escalation served to play down the suffering on the island. \u201cThe way that the documents are reported can minimise. There are only some cases where you can\u2019t minimise: if somebody dies, if somebody\u2019s burned themselves to the point where they\u2019re almost dead, if somebody\u2019s hanged themselves to the point where there is continuing harm, some things you can\u2019t find a way to minimise, but a lot of things you can.\u201d</p> <p>The situation on Nauru and in Australia\u2019s other offshore processing centre, Manus Island in Papua New Guinea, was worse than the incident reports reveal, Stevenson said. \u201cThe documents tell a story but they don\u2019t tell, in lots of respects, how something led to [an incident], what happens after it, and they don\u2019t reflect the actual severity sometimes. I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s a blatant failure to report, but I think there is a minimisation about those reports.\u201d</p> <p>A spokeswoman for Wilson Security said: \u201cWilson Security strictly follows the incident reporting guidelines set by the department of immigration and border protection to ensure the correct grading of incident reports filed by all service providers. Strict protocols are followed in the event that the rating of any incident report is being considered for amendment, which is only done in consultation with other service providers. </p> <p>\u201cWilson Security categorically rejects any allegation that incident reports are systemically downgraded in breach of the incident reporting guidelines, and notes that incident reports are also regularly upgraded if required.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/membership/2016/aug/11/if-you-value-guardian-australias-coverage-of-immigration-and-detention-please-help-fund-it\">If you value Guardian Australia\u2019s coverage of immigration and detention, please help fund it | Kath Viner</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A spokesperson for the Department of Immigration and Border Protection said allegations were reported in line with the incident reporting classification framework: \u201cA mechanism for reclassification is completely appropriate.</p> <p>\u201cThe classification of particular incidents can and does change over time \u2013 this is not inconsistent with our published statement. Reclassification of incident reports shows that we take each claim very seriously and act upon these with all due diligence.\u201d</p> <p>Wilson Security previously told the Senate inquiry into conditions at Nauru that it was responsible for the control room that records incidents at the detention centre.</p> <p>But months after the inquiry, Wilson Security was permitted to continue to downgrade incident reports being reported by other private contractors. The result was \u2013 as Stevenson has outlined \u2013 a sanitised set of incident reports that in some cases do not correspond with the seriousness of the events on the ground.<br></p> <p>It is unclear why the practice was allowed to continue until September 2015.

In late 2015, Deliveroo had a heavy recruitment drive on campus looking for cycle couriers, and the job seemed to offer everything I needed: flexible hours I could fit around my degree; no prior experience requirement; and most importantly, above-minimum-wage pay. Over the past nine months, these promises have faded one by one, and this week couriers heard that Deliveroo would be enforcing a new contract that would decimate our income. </p> <p>A day working for Deliveroo doesn\u2019t start at 9 and end at 5; you begin at 11.30am, work until 1.30pm, then start again at 5.30 until 9.30pm. For many, it makes no sense to go home during the afternoon hiatus, so they continue to work off the clock, meaning they don\u2019t receive the \u00a37 hourly rate. If you see a Deliveroo courier between the hours of 2pm and 5pm, it could well be they\u2019re working for as little as \u00a33 or \u00a34 an hour.</p> <p>My zone, where I collect and deliver orders, is Marylebone, Mayfair and Soho. Other zones are huge \u2013 I have a friend in Putney who regularly cycles three or four miles to a restaurant, then just as many more miles to the customer. Under the new contract, he could earn as little as \u00a33.75 an hour. This is made possible by our being technically \u201cself employed\u201d, which also means that in the event of an accident or injury, we\u2019re completely alone and have no access to legal help or sick pay.</p> <p>Deliveroo couriers are a diverse bunch \u2013 we\u2019re full-time, part-time, students, graduates, uneducated, and we\u2019re from all over the world.

  "<p>It was once sacrilege to argue against specialists in the Test team. Bits and pieces/multi-dimensional cricketers were for one-day cricket while genuine all\u2011rounders at Test level were as rare as shooting stars.</p> <p>Yet now there are obviously too many specialists in the England side. Look at the one-dimensional cricketers at the top of the order, Alex Hales, James Vince, despite bowling 24 balls in Test cricket, and Gary Ballance, who has propelled two overs, are there simply to score runs and then field as best they can. And they are struggling in their specialist subject.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/11/england-pakistan-fourth-test-day-one-match-report\">England make early breakthrough after Pakistan restrict them to 328 all out</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Go further down the lineup and the business of run-scoring seems more straightforward, albeit against a slightly older ball. That was the case again on Thursday. Jonny Bairstow at six, Moeen Ali, a magnificent seven, and Chris Woakes at eight hauled England out of a potentially embarrassing situation: 110 for five became 328 all out.</p> <p>This is a familiar pattern, of concern since England are becoming dependent on a late-innings rally, and it gives rise to continuing debate about how they should line up.</p> <p>Surely the one easy conclusion is that when Ben Stokes, another all-rounder \u2013 yes, he justifies that description as do the aforementioned trio \u2013 returns to fitness he should replace one of the specialist batsmen rather than a bowler?</p> <p>But there are other issues relating to the best balance of an England team, which is evolving so encouragingly without being reassuringly consistent. How best to maximise the talents of Bairstow and Moeen in particular? Are they batting in the right place? Is it mere superstition-blinkered conservatism or solid common sense to leave them where they are or should they be promoted?</p> <p>The nettle was grasped with Joe Root. He has been elevated to No3 and a double century later it seems a good idea to have one of the best batsmen at three to dictate the flow of the game. There was no need to fear that change.</p> <p>Moeen\u2019s situation may be easier to assess than Bairstow\u2019s. Since the Lord\u2019s match, when he naively declared English batsmen should use their feet to Yasir Shah before gallivanting down the wicket the following day, only to swish at fresh air, Moeen has batted superbly against Pakistan and especially so against their leg-spinner.</p> <p>This much is certain: Moeen should never be relegated to No8 again for England. At seven he has a phenomenal record. After another silky contribution at The Oval he is averaging 106 in 10 Test innings at seven. It is tempting to leave him there. He has a bit more time to acclimatise before being surrounded by the tail yet he is able to bat without inhibition, partly because he is at seven, more significantly because he has another role as a spin bowler. There will often be a confusion with Moeen since he is a better batsman than a bowler but there is no doubt that he warrants a place in the team.</p> <p>Bairstow\u2019s situation is odder. The usual source of agonising over batsmen/wicketkeepers is along these lines: how much does the business of keeping limit the ability and energy to score runs? But in Bairstow\u2019s case the opposite is true.</p> <p>The figures suggest that at this stage of his career Bairstow bats much better when playing as a wicketkeeper. He averages 59 as an all-rounder (in 14 matches), 28 as a specialist batsman (in 17 Tests).</p> <p>Contrast that with two great players who wrestled \u2013 along with their selectors \u2013 with the dilemma of whether to play as a specialist or an all-rounder. Alec Stewart, whose preference would have been to play for England as a pure batsman at the top of the order, averaged 46 in that role (in 51 of his 133 Tests), but 34 as a keeper; Kumar Sangakkara averaged 66 for Sri Lanka as a specialist (in 86 of his 134 Tests) and 40 when keeping.</p> <p>But Bairstow, who has been prolific with the bat for England this year, actively wants to keep wicket. Admittedly his figures could be misleading; the low average as a specialist coincides with his first phase as an England player; he was still acclimatising. But the difference is so stark that it must be significant.</p> <p>Having a dual role \u2013 as demonstrated over the years by Ian Botham, Freddie Flintoff or Adam Gilchrist, whose best tally of runs in a calendar year has been surpassed by Bairstow in this game \u2013 can be liberating when at the crease. There is a freedom to give full rein to the inclination to attack and that is when Bairstow is at his most dangerous. Unlike Sangakkara he likes the insurance of a dual role; unlike Stewart he is not a top-order batsman; even without the gloves No5 would be plenty high enough for him.</p> <p>Hence the obvious way forward must be to allow Bairstow to continue keeping provided he is doing that job competently.</p> <p>There was also a cameo from Woakes at The Oval, which illustrated the freedom of the all-rounder neatly. He hit eight boundaries in his 45, mostly sweetly timed drives and glides through the off side. These are the type of strokes that James Vince agonises over when playing Test cricket. He can play them; but he sometimes nicks them and now he is not so sure.</p> <p>By contrast Woakes, liberated by his all-rounder status and his run of brilliant form, does not think twice about what to do. At the moment he just trusts his instincts and the ball races away.</p>",
  "<p>Tata Steel is increasingly confident about securing a rescue deal for its UK business and the Port Talbot steelworks in Wales, after talks with the business secretary and the Pensions Regulator.</p> <p>Approximately 11,000 jobs are at risk after Tata Steel threatened to pull out of the UK. However, a senior source close to the process said an agreement to secure the future of Tata Steel UK and<a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/11/tata-steel-financial-aid-pledge-remains-despite-scrapping-of-sale\"> Port Talbot</a> was \u201cnearly there\u201d, although it might not be finalised until the final quarter of the year.</p> <p>Negotiations to save the business are complicated. Tata Steel shelved plans to sell its UK operations after David Cameron\u2019s government offered hundreds of millions of pounds of financial support and indicated it was ready to change the law so the company could restructure its pension scheme, which has a deficit of \u00a3700m. </p> <p>Tata Steel now plans to<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/08/tata-stops-port-talbot-plant-sale-as-talks-begin-with-german-steel-group\"> merge its European operations, including the UK business, with ThyssenKrupp</a>. It will also sell its speciality steels business and its pipe mills, which are based in northern England and employ about 2,000 people.</p> <p>However, Tata Steel and ThyssenKrupp will include the UK operations in the tie-up only if the pension scheme can be restructured and the package of support from the government \u2013 which includes loans on commercial terms worth up to \u00a31bn \u2013 can be secured. This has been complicated by the EU referendum and the change of prime minister.</p> <p>Greg Clark, the business secretary, held positive talks with the Tata chairman, Cyrus Mistry, in India on Wednesday. Clark\u2019s predecessor, Sajid Javid, had pledged to help Tata Steel UK and Theresa May\u2019s government is understood to be supportive of the plan.</p> <p>\u201cThey are following the same route as previous,\u201d the source said. \u201cThe sentiment is the same.\u201d</p> <p>Talks with ThyssenKrupp are understood to be progressing well. The German conglomerate said on Thursday the EU referendum would not impact on the potential deal, but had slowed the progress of talks.</p> <p>Guido Kerkhoff, ThyssenKrupp\u2019s finance director, said: \u201cBrexit is something that definitely effects us on the timeline. For the discussion, it\u2019s actually neutral.\u201d </p> <p>He declined to say when the talks were likely to be completed, adding: \u201cSometimes one has to live with uncertainty.\u201d</p> <p>Tata Steel is in talks with the Pensions Regulator about the British Steel pension scheme, which was inherited by the Indian company when it bought Corus for \u00a36.2bn in 2007. The scheme has 130,000 members, liabilities of \u00a315bn and a deficit of \u00a3700m.</p> <p>Tata Steel is examining various options to restructure the pension scheme and lower the deficit. It is understood that the options no longer include the government changing the law so that the inflation-based annual increase in benefits is connected to the lower consumer price index, rather than the retail price index. </p> <p>The law change was backed by Javid, despite concerns from the Department for Work and Pensions and the Pension Protection Fund that it could create a dangerous precedent.</p> <p>A restructuring of the scheme could involve Tata Steel pumping money into it in return for a change in workers\u2019 benefits.</p> <p>A spokesperson for the Pensions Regulator said: \u201cWe continue to engage with the trustees, employer and government on the issues facing the British Steel pension scheme. We will only comment in more detail if and when it is appropriate to do so.\u201d</p> <p>The government said it was committed to finding a \u201clong-term viable future\u201d for the steel industry in the UK.</p> <p>A spokesperson for the new Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, created by May, said: \u201cThis is a difficult time for steel workers in Port Talbot and across the UK. The government is committed to helping the steel industry secure a long-term viable future in the UK.\u201d </p> <p>Trade union leaders have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/20/business-secretary-greg-clark-crisis-talks-tata-steel-bosses-unions\">grown frustrated at the time it has taken Tata Steel to resolve the future of its UK business</a>. The Indian company <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/29/tata-set-to-announce-sale-of-uk-steel-business-port-talbot\">first warned that the future of Tata Steel UK was being reviewed in March</a>. This led to heavy criticism of the government for not doing enough to support the industry. Javid was in Australia with his daughter when Tata Steel made the announcement.</p> <p>Tata Steel then invited bids for the business. It <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/09/tata-steel-seven-bidders-uk-operations\">eventually shortlisted seven proposals</a>, including a management buyout and a bid from the energy tycoon Sanjeev Gupta. However, the government\u2019s pledge to provide<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/21/government-take-stake-tata-steel-british-plants\"> hundreds of millions of pounds of financial aid </a>encouraged Tata Steel to reconsider its position and the bids were dismissed as unattractive.</p> <p>Tata Steel\u2019s drive to rebuild the UK business has become less urgent because the pressure on the steel industry has eased. Earlier this year Tata Steel was losing more than \u00a31m a day in the UK, with an influx of cheap steel from China driving down prices.</p> <p>However, steel prices have risen since March. The fall in the value of sterling also means that Tata Steel\u2019s exports have become more attractive and it is more expensive for Chinese companies to import steel into the UK.</p> <p>A Tata Steel spokesman said: \u201cWe remain committed to achieving the best possible outcome for our UK business. Our aim remains to find a sustainable future for our UK business. There are a number of options which we are pursuing to achieve that.\u201d<br><br></p>",

In 1984 the study Black and White Britain was published by the Policy Studies Institute. The author, Colin Brown, is now my husband. He found that though vastly fewer Asian women than black or white women were in the workforce, among those Asian women in employment only 18% were Muslim. Today eight Muslim women are in parliament, and several are peers. More British Muslim women than men are getting degrees.</p> <p>I am a part-time professor at Middlesex University, where many of my students are feisty young Muslim women. One of them, Saira (not her real name), told me recently: \u201cMy mother can\u2019t read or write. They got her married at 12, when she was a child. But she pushed me and my five sisters, stopped my father arranging our marriages. She is like a lioness.\u201d Sharmin was a young, incredibly bright Bangladeshi mum in Bethnal Green. I used to teach her English. After her husband left her and married a younger wife, she enrolled at a further education college. She is now a social worker.</p> <p>Some Muslim leaders have been calling for these transformative developments for a very long time. Back in 1924, our worldwide imam, the Aga Khan, instructed his believers to educate daughters because they would then go on to raise educated children and, in time, prepare congregations for a future they could not even imagine.As a child in the 60s, I remember the first time I saw women doctors in our mosque surgery in Kampala, Uganda, and teachers clip-clopping in high heels in our schools.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Women who sound 'British' and believe they are, turn up at interviews where visceral hostility comes at them</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>According to the parliamentary report, \u201cthe impact of Islamophobia should not be underestimated\u201d and there is now a \u201cchill factor\u201d stopping women applying for jobs and promotion.

That is a remarkable figure. Yet just when things were getting better, they got worse. Attitudes towards migrants, minorities and refugees have noticeably hardened since Ukip and other rightwing politicians moved from the fringes to the heart of British politics.</p> <p>Jihadi terror cells undeniably have some support from British Muslims.

Since the late 60s, when the first race relations laws were passed, most white Brits accepted the need to protect minorities against discrimination. Not any more, it seems. The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commission_for_Racial_Equality\">Commission for Racial Equality</a> was abolished a decade ago and its notional replacement, the Equality and Human Rights Commission, is moribund. Race equality has been kicked off the agenda while racism goes up.</p> <p>However, the report\u2019s authors are completely right when they say the discrimination Muslim women experience \u201cis exacerbated by the pressures that some women feel from parts of their communities to fulfil a more traditional role\u201d. It\u2019s clear that self-segregation is increasing within some communities. <a href=\"http://www.farhathashmi.com/profile-section/dr-farhat-hashmi-at-a-glance/\">Farhat Hashmi</a>, who gained her PhD from Glasgow University, is one of the most influential internet female proselytisers.

This, I fear, is where we fall flat. Weaver believes strongly that anti-discrimination measures need to go hand in hand with a reform of cultural, parental and religious practices and beliefs.</p> <p>The parliamentary report recognises that both discrimination and internal oppression keep Muslim women in their airless, hopeless places. Governments can tackle the first, but who in a liberal society would dare challenge the second?</p>",

The MEK, which was listed as a terrorist organisation by the US and Europe for many years, is still hugely unpopular in Iran because of its terror campaign after the revolution. It has become a cult-like group, condemned by the UN for its treatment of its own members. <br></p> <p>In the audio recording, Montazeri tells his audience that he believes the authorities had a plan to execute political prisoners for a few years and found a good excuse in the wake of the incursion. Montazeri\u2019s own son, Mohammad, was a \u201cmartyr\u201d of the 1979 revolution, whose assassination the ayatollah blamed on the MEK. Not all the people killed in 1988 were MEK supporters and most were in jail for some time. <br></p> <p>The ayatollah says he felt compelled to speak out because otherwise he would not have an answer on the \u201cjudgment day\u201d. \u201cI haven\u2019t been able to sleep and every night it occupies my mind for two to three hours \u2026 what do you have to tell to the families?\u201d <br></p> <p>Later in the recording, Montazeri insinuates that the number of people executed since the revolution outnumbered those put to death by the deposed Shah.

I am opposed even to a single person being executed.\u201d</p> <p>Although execution of dissidents was rife in Iran in the 1980s, the 1988 summer executions were on a different scale. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/amnesty-international\">Amnesty International</a> estimates the number of people put to death in that summer alone to be about 4,500, although others talk of bigger numbers. <br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/11/homa-hoodfar-detention-iran-unjust-unislamic\">The detention of Homa Hoodfar is unjust and unIslamic.

I even bought a T-shirt. But what struck me most was the place\u2019s air of dusty decline, and the sense that Trotsky\u2019s legacy was now almost irrelevant.</p> <p>But now look: 76 years after his death, the adopted surname of Lev Bronstein is <a href=\"https://twitter.com/paul__johnson/status/763485059022225408\" title=\"\">on the front page of the Guardian</a>.

The answer involves 80 years of arcane history, and&#xa0;a baffling soup of splinter groups and cliques, from the International Marxist Group and the Workers Revolutionary party, to the Socialist Workers party and&#xa0;the Revolutionary Socialist League.&#xa0;We have not space to list them all here; neither would most people have the mental appetite.</p> <p>Suffice to say that a great deal of the current fuss goes back to <a href=\"http://www.militant.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Militant</a> \u2013 aka the Militant tendency \u2013 which initially took root in Merseyside, and whose people began to join the Labour party in the early 1960s. Twenty or so years later, buoyed by the fact that many local Labour parties were moribund and inward-looking and some people wanted a much more energetic politics, they had a lot going for them: their own newspaper, a clandestine organisation inside Labour, and two MPs, as well as control of Liverpool city council (whose most vocal figurehead was the legendary <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DegsyHatton\" title=\"\">Derek Hatton</a>, a man who eventually became involved in <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/personalfinance/fameandfortune/3129837/Fame-and-Fortune-Derek-Hatton-the-militant-capitalist.html\" title=\"\">the great proletarian pastime of property development</a>). Most of this was secured via \u201centryism\u201d, which goes back to one of Trotsky\u2019s tactical feints in the 1930s, whereby he <a href=\"http://www.bolshevik.org/1917/no9/no09frnt.html\" title=\"\">urged his followers in France</a> to cease operating as a separate political unit, and quietly crowd into the mainstream Socialist party.</p> <p>The practice of Trotskyist politics has long been built around the idea of the \u201ctransitional demand\u201d, a rather cynical manoeuvre whereby you encourage people to agitate for this or that \u2013 a hugely increased minimum wage, perhaps, or the end of all immigration controls \u2013 knowing full well it is unattainable within the current order of things, but that when the impossibility becomes apparent, the workers will belatedly wake up. In other words, the herd gets whipped up into a frenzy about something you know it won\u2019t get, while you smugly sit things out, hoping that if everything aligns correctly, another crack will appear in the great bourgeois edifice. For non-Trots, what this kind of game entails is obvious: in tandem with the aforementioned entryism, it means you never know quite what you are dealing with.</p> <p>I know this feeling well. Back in 1986, brimming with the socialist passions I had partly soaked up from such musicians as Billy Bragg and Paul Weller, I co-founded a branch of the Labour party\u2019s youth wing in the well-known socialist hotbed of Tatton \u2013 then represented by the soon to be disgraced <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/10/neil-hamilton-disgraced-mp-celebrity-political-comeback-ukip\" title=\"\">MP Neil Hamilton</a>, and these days the adopted home turf of George Osborne. But the Labour Party Young Socialists, as it was known, was then controlled by Militant, and soon enough a few of their troops popped up in the constituency, quickly gaining control of the branch and the two seats it was granted on the local Labour general management committee. God knows what they were thinking: today Wilmslow, Knutsford and Northwich; tomorrow the world?</p> <p>What happened to me in the interim was grim: repeatedly being accused of \u201cnot knowing my history\u201d (true: I was 16) and becoming so miserable about a mixture of unpleasant behaviour and ulterior motives that one night I got home from yet another meeting and burst into tears. That was me done: after a last blast of activism in a nearby constituency where Militant was apparently not active, I jacked in the Labour party for the best part of 15 years.</p> <p>Such was a very small manifestation of a brief but grim phase of Labour history. But if it\u2019s all once again relevant, so might be one of its subplots: the fact that while the party leadership was rounding on Militant (who would eventually reappear as the Socialist party), among the people who opposed its chasing-out was Corbyn.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m50rq6BgQg\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/5m50rq6BgQg?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>The Labour party moves against Militant, 1985</figcaption> </figure>   <p>The details are in a freshly published edition of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/apr/28/militant-michael-crick-review-jeremy-corbyn-labour-party\" title=\"\">Michael Crick\u2019s book Militant</a>: the fact that as expulsions began, Corbyn struck a loud note of common cause from his part of the Labour left (\u201cIf expulsions are in order for Militant, they should apply to us too\u201d), and was even the \u201cprovisional convenor\u201d of something called the Defeat the Witch-Hunt campaign. His stance reflected the position of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/aug/15/jeremy-corbyn-world-supporters-mentors-influences\" title=\"\">his guru Tony Benn</a>, who cleaved to the old maxim \u201cNo&#xa0;enemies on the left\u201d. Beyond an official insistence that the Socialist party remains a \u201cproscribed organisation\u201d, the extent to which the Labour leader still believes in such things is rather unclear: we may soon see, I suppose.</p> <p>There is something noble about the fact that the Trotskyists are still here. They may even have gone through their own New Labour-esque process of revision and reform: the Militants I knew always assured me that their revolutionary plan was based on nothing less than the nationalisation of the top 200 companies, but I see from the <a href=\"http://www.socialistparty.org.uk/main/Home\" title=\"\">Socialist party website </a>that this has now been reduced to a modest 150.</p> <p>Aside from all that, the Militant founder and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/10/leader-expelled-leftwing-group-militant-peter-taaffe-readmission-labour-corbyn\" title=\"\">big cheese Peter Taaffe reckons</a> not just that he has a good chance of soon <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/10/leader-expelled-leftwing-group-militant-peter-taaffe-readmission-labour-corbyn\" title=\"\">being readmitted to the party</a> that chucked him out all those years ago, but that when it comes to the Corbyn insurgency, \u201cThe lava of this revolution is still hot\u201d (tssss!) and that the new leader\u2019s adversaries will not \u201cstop the winds of history as they\u2019re developing at the moment\u201d. On the face if it, then, he is now a paid-up Corbynite. Or maybe it\u2019s just more \u201ctransitional\u201d mischief. That\u2019s the thing about Trotskyists: you can never tell.</p>",

Let\u2019s play a lunchtime game. No, not the JD Wetherspoon Challenge; we\u2019ll do that at tea. This is the patented Guardian Cricket Nerd Challenge. Your first task is to name three captains who infamously chose to field first in a Test match. Easy: Nasser Hussain (Brisbane 2002), Ricky Ponting (Edgbaston 2005), Mohammad Azharuddin (Lord\u2019s 1990) and tens of others. </p> <p>Your second task is name three captains who infamously chose to <em>bat</em> first n a Test. Not such a smart guy now, are ya? Batting first was normative behaviour for so long that, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/jul/18/the-spin-england-south-africa\">short of choosing to bat in Johannesburg \u201999 conditions</a>, a captain is never really criticised for having first dig. Michael Clarke\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/743967.html\">series-turning decision to bat at Edgbaston</a> last summer is nowhere near as notorious as Ponting\u2019s on the same ground in 2005.</p> <p>It is what it is what it is, but it is changing ever so slowly and there has been a relative outcry about Alastair Cook\u2019s decision to bat first on an Oval greentop. It was a conservative if understandable decision, the kind you make when you a 2-1 up with one to play. England went to lunch on 92 for four, a consequence of some sloppy strokes as much as the pitch, and have plenty of work to do. Early impression are that this fine series, probably the best we\u2019ve seen in this country since 2005, is going to end with a cracker.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57ac69f8e4b0fe7550974c79\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-11T12:06:41.137Z\">1.06pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Well that was fun, wasn\u2019t it?</strong> England made all the early running, going at over four an over despite the slightly unfortunate loss of Hales, before Wahab Riaz came on and forced them on to the back foot with a ferocious spell of fast, wicket-taking bowling.

The appointment of Jones Day to scrutinise BHS <a href=\"http://news.sky.com/story/top-law-firm-to-scrutinise-ex-bhs-directors-10531739\">was first reported by Sky News</a>.</p> <p>BHS collapsed into administration in April, putting 11,000 jobs at risk and leaving a pension deficit of \u00a3571m. The last of the company\u2019s 164 shops will close on 20 August, while its flagship store on Oxford Street in London will close this weekend.</p> <p>The demise of BHS is being investigated by the Insolvency Service, the Pensions Regulator and the Financial Reporting Council. The Serious Fraud Office is also examining whether there are grounds to launch a criminal investigation.</p> <p>A parliamentary investigation into the collapse of BHS, led by Labour MPs Frank Field and Iain Wright, accused Green of representing the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/25/bhs-demise-sir-philip-green-reputation-torn-apart-in-damning-report\">\u201cunacceptable face of capitalism\u201d</a>.</p> <p>Green and other investors collected<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/25/bhs-philip-green-family-millions-administration-arcadia\"> \u00a3586m in dividends</a>, rent and interest during his family\u2019s 15-year ownership of BHS. He sold the retailer for \u00a31 in March 2015 to Chappell, a serial bankrupt. Chappell\u2019s consortium, Retail Acquisitions, extracted another \u00a317m from BHS before it collapsed this year.</p> <p>FRP was brought in as the second administrator to BHS by the Pension Protection Fund, the company\u2019s biggest creditor. The PPF did not publicly explain why it wanted another administrator to work with Duff &amp; Phelps, which was initially appointed. However, Chappell claimed to MPs that Duff &amp; Phelps were Green\u2019s \u201cponies\u201d and \u201cdo exactly what Philip tells them to do\u201d. Green denied this. </p> <p>Duff &amp; Phelps said in its reports to creditors, published in June, that it had identified transactions within BHS that required further investigation.</p> <p>\u201cDuring our preliminary investigations there are a number of transactions that on the face of it may require investigation. Additional information is required to understand the true nature of the transactions,\u201d it said.</p> <p>The chief executive of BHS, Darren Topp, told MPs that Chappell had his<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jun/08/bhs-inquiry-hears-of-theft-and-death-threats-in-dramatic-day-of-testimony\"> \u201cfingers in the till\u201d</a> during his ownership of BHS. In their report, MPs said Green and Chappell had overseen the \u201csystematic plunder\u201d of BHS.</p> <p>Chappell has claimed that all payments made to Retail Acquisitions were contractually agreed, while Green has said that significantly more was invested in BHS than taken out while he was in charge.</p>",
  "<p>Donald Trump refused to back down from his false claim that Barack Obama was \u201cthe founder of Isis\u201d on Thursday, insisting: \u201cHe was the founder ... The way he got out of Iraq was the founding of Isis.\u201d<br></p> <p>The Republican presidential candidate was speaking to conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt, who had attempted to reframe <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/11/donald-trump-calls-barack-obama-the-founder-of-isis\">his remark</a>, telling him: \u201cI know what you meant \u2013 you meant that he created the vacuum, he lost the peace.\u201d </p> <p>But Trump disagreed. \u201cNo, I meant that he\u2019s the founder of Isis, I do,\u201d he said. \u201cHe was the most valuable player \u2013 I gave him the most valuable player award. I give her too, by the way,\u201d he added of his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton. </p> <p>Trump did acknowledge that the root of his argument was that if Obama \u201chad done things properly, you wouldn\u2019t have had Isis\u201d, but he repeated: \u201cTherefore, he was the founder of Isis.\u201d </p> <p>And he doggedly pursued that line of thought in a later speech to homebuilders in Miami on Thursday, now suggesting it was Clinton who would be given \u201cthe most valuable player award\u201d by Islamic State. \u201cHer only competition is Barack Obama,\u201d he said, adding of Clinton: \u201cOh boy, is Isis hoping for her.\u201d </p> <p>Trump\u2019s remarks about Isis came while he is still dealing with backlash from his hint that gun rights supporters might attack Clinton, something that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/10/trump-assassination-remark-clinton-second-amendment\">seemed to cause genuine shock</a> in a country that has grown used to Trump pushing the boundaries of appropriate political discourse. On Thursday, Patti Davis, the daughter of late Republican former president Ronald Reagan, joined his critics to lambast him for what she called a \u201cglib and horrifying comment\u201d. </p> <p>\u201cI am the daughter of a man who was shot by someone who got his inspiration from a movie, someone who believed if he killed the president the actress from that movie would notice him,\u201d she said, referring to the attempted assassination of Reagan by John Hinckley in 1981. </p> <p>Trump\u2019s remark about Clinton, she said, \u201cwas heard by the person sitting alone in a room, locked in his own dark fantasies, who sees unbridled violence as a way to make his mark in the world, and is just looking for ideas. Yes, Mr Trump, words matter. But then you know that, which makes this all even more horrifying.\u201d</p> <p>Trump first claimed Obama was \u201cthe founder of Isis\u201d on Wednesday night at a rally in Sunrise, Florida.</p> <p>\u201cIsis is honoring President Obama,\u201d Trump said of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/isis\">Islamic State</a>. \u201cHe is the founder of Isis.

Anyone willing to sink so low, so often should never be allowed to serve as our commander-in-chief.\u201d</p> <p>Since July\u2019s Republican convention, Clinton has taken a firm lead in the polls as Trump has struggled from controversy to controversy, pursuing a feud with the Muslim family of a dead US army captain and suggesting Russia publish any of Clinton\u2019s missing emails it has hacked, before this week\u2019s inflammatory remarks. The Democratic candidate is 7.9 points ahead in the latest polling average <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/us/general_election_trump_vs_clinton-5491.html\">compiled by Real Clear Politics</a>.</p> <p>On Thursday, <a href=\"http://time.com/4447527/donald-trump-republican-national-committee/\">Time magazine claimed</a> that Republican National Committee chair Reince Priebus had told Trump that if he did not manage to right his campaign, the party might abandon support for his presidential bid and focus instead on Republicans running for Congress elsewhere in the country.</p> <p>Quoting two anonymous party officials familiar with the conversation, Time said Priebus had told Trump that internal polling suggested he was on track to lose the election and that he would have been better off heading to his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida for a break than hitting the trail after the convention.</p> <p>Trump dismissed the story. \u201cReince Priebus is a terrific guy,\u201d he told Time. \u201cHe never said that.\u201d</p> <p>Clinton was attempting to shift the focus to the economy on Thursday with a speech in Detroit. She intended to try to make the case that Trump\u2019s policies would benefit him and his wealthy friends, and to characterize his plans as an update of \u201ctrickle-down economics\u201d. </p> <p>Her speech was in part a response to one given by Trump in the beleaguered Rust Belt city <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/08/donald-trump-tax-plan-business-income-middle-class\">on Monday</a>, when he proposed dramatically slashing taxes, reducing income tax brackets from seven levels to three \u2013 of 12%, 25% and 33% \u2013 and eliminating income taxes for individuals who earn less than $25,000 annually, or $50,000 for a married couple. </p> <p>That speech had been intended to reboot his flagging campaign, but was soon overtaken by the controversy over his \u201csecond amendment people\u201d comments, which in turn gave way to Wednesday\u2019s remarks about Obama and Isis. </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/republicans\">Republicans</a> have long sought to blame the turmoil in the Middle East on the Obama administration\u2019s foreign policy, often criticizing the president for underestimating the threat Isis poses. But Trump has routinely gone a step further by stating directly that Obama is sympathetic to terrorists. Immediately after the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/18/orlando-nightlcub-shooting-pulse-florida-attack-timeline\">12 June mass shooting</a> at an LGBT nightclub in Orlando, Florida, which left 49 dead and 53 injured, Trump said cryptically that Obama \u201cdoesn\u2019t get it or he gets it better than anybody understands\u201d. </p> <p>In his speech on Wednesday, the former reality TV star pointedly chose several times to repeat the president\u2019s full name, Barack Hussein Obama.</p> <p>The origins of Isis trace back to the aftermath of the US invasion of Iraq in 2003. The group has been deemed an offshoot of al-Qaida, which carried out the attacks on 9/11. Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the Jordanian militant terrorist viewed as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/10/how-isis-crippled-al-qaida\">the founder of Isis</a>, was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/jun/08/iraq.alqaida\">killed in a US airstrike</a> in Baghdad in 2006.</p> <p>Although Isis has expanded rapidly during Obama\u2019s tenure, seizing in particular on the Syrian civil war, the administration has also made gains in its military campaign against the extremist group. US army Lt Gen Sean MacFarland said on Wednesday an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/11/isis-ranks-dwindle-to-15000-amid-retreat-on-all-fronts-claims-pentagon\">estimated 45,000 fighters</a> linked to Isis had been killed in the two years since the US-led military coalition against the network was launched.</p> <p>Trump has not articulated a clear strategy against Isis, other than to threaten a ruthless bombing campaign and continuously push his proposal to ban Muslim immigration from the US.</p>",

  "<p>What happens when God wants to retire? Although the emperor of Japan is no longer a deity, there was a time, not so long ago, when the country\u2019s imperial rulers were believed to govern earthly affairs and those of heaven. The current emperor, Akihito, is very much human and has no desire to be a god \u2013 although Japan\u2019s ruling Liberal Democratic party, led by prime minister Shinzo Abe, would like to restore Japan\u2019s pre-war constitution and to return the emperor to god-like status.</p> <p>That is not something the 82-year-old emperor desires either for himself or his successors. In his highly unusual <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/08/japans-emperor-akihito-health-abdication-rare-tv-address\" title=\"\">speech to the Japanese people</a>, he obliquely indicated his desire to relinquish the throne while still alive and referred to himself as \u201ca symbol of the state\u201d no fewer than seven times.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/08/japans-emperor-akihito-health-abdication-rare-tv-address\">Japan's Emperor Akihito says health is failing and hints at abdication</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A pacifist who opposes the return to a pre-war militaristic nation, Akihito, who came to the throne in 1989, believes firmly in the war-renouncing constitution imposed by the allies in 1947, as does his beloved wife, empress Michiko. His 2013 birthday press conference spelled it out quite clearly. \u201cAfter the war, Japan was occupied by the allied forces, and based on peace and democracy as values to be upheld, established the constitution of Japan, undertook various reforms and built the foundation of Japan that we know today. I have profound gratitude for the efforts made by the Japanese people at the time who helped reconstruct and improve the country devastated by the war. I also feel that we must not forget the help extended to us in those days by Americans with an understanding of Japan and Japanese culture.\u201d It\u2019s a message that the ascending right wing in Japan finds unpleasant.</p> <p>Akihito has a clear disdain for the reinstatement of state shinto. The official religion until 1945 was used by the Japanese government to promote belief in the divinity of the emperor and&#xa0;became the justification for conducting Japan\u2019s imperial expansion in the 1930s. The emperor\u2019s words were infallible; the Yamato race was superior. During the second world war millions of Japanese soldiers died and killed in the name of emperor Hirohito.</p> <p>But the son of Hirohito has no truck&#xa0;with forced patriotism. Mark Austin, a Scottish journalist in Tokyo who was employed by the Yomiuri, a rightwing newspaper that is also the biggest in Japan, wrote in a post on social media: \u201cAt a press conference on his 68th birthday in 2001, [Akihito] referred to his Korean ancestry, shattering a long taboo, and at a spring garden party three years later, he mildly, but to devastating effect, admonished a functionary of the Tokyo municipal board of education who informed him he\u2019d been touring schools to make sure all teachers were standing up for the national anthem, and singing it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"1a4b403f70f44d3df81ca6f64c5637ce719dfa52\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1a4b403f70f44d3df81ca6f64c5637ce719dfa52/0_174_2031_2426/837.jpg\" alt=\"The Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe: \u2018Abdication and the debate and legal revision it would require stands in the way of Abe\u2019s burning desire to make state shinto a centrepiece of civil society again.\u2019\" width=\"837\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe: \u2018Abdication and the debate and legal revision it would require stands in the way of Abe\u2019s burning desire to make state shinto a centrepiece of civil society again.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jiji Press/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201c\u2018It is not good if it is forced,\u2019 he said.</p> <p>\u201cThe lickspittle functionary bowed deeply.</p> <p>\u201cThe encounter created a stir.\u201d</p> <p>His compassionate work for social causes and his hands-on approach to comforting survivors of disasters, meanwhile, have endeared him to the people. After the 2011 earthquake and nuclear disaster, he&#xa0;visited survivors who were temporarily housed in a gym. He got down on his knees on the floor of the gym to speak with them as equals. He later gave an official address to Japan, calling on the people to work together to overcome the tragedy. The only other time an emperor had made an official address to the nation was on 15 August 1945, when Hirohito told his subjects that Japan was going to surrender.</p> <p>The emperor and his wife have also made a point of looking after poor people, disabled people and even the Korean-Japanese or Zainichi \u2013 many of whom arrived in Japan as slave labour and are routinely blamed for economic woes and openly harassed. The new governor of Tokyo, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/31/tokyo-elects-first-female-governor\" title=\"\">Yuriko Koike</a>, along&#xa0;with several other cabinet ministers handpicked by Abe, have been&#xa0;associated with Zaitokukai, a political group accused of inciting hostility towards all foreigners, and Korean-Japanese in particular.</p> <p>Akihito\u2019s compassion and humility are, by contrast, much appreciated by the people, with most polls showing that 80% or more believe he should be allowed to abdicate the throne.</p> <p>Public support for his desire to abdicate may, as Devin Stewart \u2013 an expert on modern Japan at the <a href=\"https://www.carnegiecouncil.org/index.html\" title=\"\">Carnegie Council</a> \u2013 has noted, reflect much broader social changes. \u201cJapan is gradually becoming a more flexible and individualistic, less traditional society. Paradoxically, that also means that people feel they should be able to spend more time with their families (a traditional value) as well as more time pursuing hobbies and being rested and healthy.\u201d</p> <p>Under the current law Akihito has&#xa0;to&#xa0;carry on until he dies, and constitutional constraints mean that he&#xa0;can\u2019t ask directly for changes in the law, he can only hint.</p> <p>After a lifetime of selfless service and of battling illness and frailty, the emperor is, in effect, asking for some mercy and compassion for himself and his family. What cruel despot could possibly deny him the rest and retirement he deserves? The current prime minister might. Abdication and the debate and legal revision it would require stands in the way of Abe\u2019s burning desire to alter the constitution, limit civil liberties and make state shinto a centrepiece of civil society again.</p> <p>Akihito\u2019s words about the duty of&#xa0;being a good emperor are, in my opinion, his own way&#xa0;of reminding Japan\u2019s leaders to think less about themselves \u2013 and more&#xa0;about the welfare of the people. It\u2019s a lesson the prime minister could certainly learn.</p> <p>\u201cI ascended to the throne approximately 28 years ago,\u201d Akihito eloquently explained, \u201cand during these years, I have spent my days together with the people of Japan, sharing much of the joys as well as the sorrows that have happened in our country. I have considered that the first and foremost duty of the emperor is to pray for peace and happiness of all the people. At the same time, I also believe that in some cases it is essential to stand by the people, listen to their voices, and be close to them in their thoughts.\u201d</p> <p>If prime minister Abe really cares about the peace and happiness of the Japanese people, he might actually listen to the will of the people and the wishes of the man he worships as a god.</p>",
  "<p>The BHS scandal is far from over, in fact it may only just be starting. The flagship store on Oxford Street in London is pulling down its shutters for the final time this weekend and the last of the retail chain\u2019s 164 outlets around the country will all be closed by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/23/all-bhs-stores-to-shut-down-by-20-august\">following Saturday</a>.</p> <p>However, the news that Jones Day has been brought in to investigate the conduct of BHS\u2019s directors in the run-up to its collapse shows that questions remain unanswered.</p> <p>Jones Day has been brought in by FRP Advisory, the joint administrator to BHS. It is standard practice for an administrator to bring in a law firm to help with an insolvency process, but this appointment stands out for two reasons. </p> <p>Firstly, FRP was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jun/22/pension-fund-wants-new-insolvency-experts-to-investigate-bhs-collapse\">only appointed as the second administrator in June</a> because the Pension Protection Fund \u2013 the biggest creditor to BHS \u2013 wanted a second opinion alongside the initial administrator Duff &amp; Phelps. Secondly, Jones Day is a heavyweight US law firm. FRP could have brought in a less prestigious law firm to just help it tick a few boxes, but it has chosen the outfit that is a leading an internal investigation into the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jun/22/volkswagen-handling-emissions-scandal-shambles-investors-agm-german-carmaker\">diesel emissions scandal at Volkswagen</a>.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/25/bhs-demise-sir-philip-green-reputation-torn-apart-in-damning-report\">parliamentary report into the collapse of BHS</a>, led by the Labour MPs Frank Field and Iain Wright, provided an impressive and detailed account of how the 88-year-old retailer was brought to its knees. It heavily criticised Sir Philip Green, the former owner of BHS, accusing him of plundering the company for his own financial gain. Field has subsequently described the billionaire tycoon as \u201cevil\u201d and asked the Serious Fraud Office to look into whether money was illegally moved around to make Dominic Chappell, who led the consortium that bought BHS from Green, look a credible buyer.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/08/sir-philip-green-told-do-right-thing-bhs-pension-deficit\">Sir Philip Green told to 'do the right thing' and plug BHS pension deficit</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Green clearly has a moral obligation, potentially a legal one too, to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/06/bhs-pension-deficit-sir-philip-green-sort-it\">fill the \u00a3571m blackhole in BHS\u2019s pension scheme. </a> However, Field\u2019s war of words with Green must not stop the mismanagement of BHS under Chappell from being thoroughly investigation.</p> <p>While the SFO and the Insolvency Service, which is also looking into BHS, will inevitably look into Chappell\u2019s acquisition of the retailer for \u00a31 from Green in March 2015, there are more questions about what happened in the following 13 months.</p> <p>These questions include: how did Chappell\u2019s consortium Retail Acquisitions extract at least \u00a317m from BHS while it owned the retailer? Did Retail Acquisitions breach contractual agreements with Green by taking money from the sale of BHS property? Was BHS money used to pay off the mortgage on Chappell\u2019s family home? Why did Chappell move \u00a31.5m from BHS into the unconnected BHS Sweden just days before it collapsed?</p> <p>The appointment of Jones Day will help to find the answers.</p> <h2>Minimum wage</h2> <p>The government on Thursday unveiled its new list of the companies failing to pay the minimum wage by trumpeting it as the \u201clargest ever\u201d. But the naming and shaming of so many offenders should not be celebrated; it is shameful.</p> <p>There are 198 employers on the list, including some recognisable names such as Greene King, Poundstretcher, and Brighton &amp; Hove Albion Football Club. </p> <p>Sports Direct is not on the latest list, but founder Mike Ashley has<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jun/07/sports-direct-agrees-back-pay-deal-with-hmrc-minimum-wage\"> admitted it is under investigation by HMRC </a>for failing to pay staff the minimum wage. </p> <p>The retailer\u2019s latest annual report shows that staff turnover at the company rose to 22% last year. That is three times the national average and means that one in five at Sports Direct left the business in just 12 months.</p> <p>This suggests that staff are prepared to act if they are unhappy with their job. However, not all workers have the option of another job or the confidence to leave their position. </p> <p>The government must do more than simply name-and-shame or fine offenders. Company directors should be made personally responsible for paying their staff properly and face criminal charges if they don\u2019t. It is not difficult to ensure that staff are being paid.</p> <h2>Virgin Media and Southampton</h2> <p>The Premier League football season starts on Saturday after an extraordinary summer of spending, capped by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/09/manchester-united-sign-paul-pogba-93-million-juventus\">Manchester United signing Paul Pogba for a world record fee of \u20ac110m (\u00a393.2m)</a> just four years after letting him leave for \u00a3800,000.</p> <p>But in the parallel economic world of the Premier League, an interesting sponsorship agreement has been struck that will hopefully be a blueprint for the future.</p> <p>As part of its deal to sponsor Southampton, Virgin Media will subsidise tickets for away fans travelling to the south coast football club. This means ticket prices will be capped at \u00a320.</p> <p>The move has been welcomed by the Football Supporters\u2019 Federation, which is behind a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/oct/02/twentys-plenty-premier-league-football-supporters-federation-ticket-prices\">\u201cTwenty\u2019s Plenty\u201d</a> campaign to lower football ticket prices for travelling fans.</p> <p>The tie-up between Southampton and Virgin Media is evidence that the vast amounts of money flowing into football can be used to help supporters.

  "<p>Refugees moving to Germany may in future have to give police permission to search their social media accounts for suspicious posts, the interior minister has announced.<br></p> <p>Presenting a raft of anti-terror measures at a press conference on Thursday, Thomas de Maizi\u00e8re announced that border police would pilot a scheme whereby refugees resettled in Germany under the deal between Turkey and the EU would have to hand over their smartphones for security checks if they did not have passports.</p> <p>\u201cIf you want to come to Germany, we have to make safety checks on you. And to make safety checks, we will ask you to show us your Facebook contacts from the last few months, which are public in principle anyway,\u201d he said. However, De Maizi\u00e8re admitted that it remained to be seen whether the time and cost would justify the effort.</p> <p>The scheme points to a growing frustration with traditional means of establishing a person\u2019s identity at border crossings. \u201cWe frequently encounter cases where refugees often don\u2019t carry identity documents, but do nearly all carry their smartphones,\u201d the minister said.</p> <p>The system whereby refugees are fingerprinted upon registering in the EU has also proven fallible, De Maizi\u00e8re said. In the case of the 16-year-old who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/18/about-20-people-injured-in-axe-attack-on-train-in-germany\">attacked a group of people</a> on a train near W\u00fcrzburg, a fingerprint had been taken, but it could not be matched with the <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/home-affairs/what-we-do/policies/asylum/identification-of-applicants/index_en.htm\">Europe-wide Eurodac database</a>.</p> <p>Smartphones, by contrast, are valuable tools for many refugees, allowing them to stay in touch with friends and relatives, and gather potentially lifesaving information.</p> <p>Earlier this week, German police arrested a Syrian asylum seeker suspected of planning to carry out an attack at the start of the Bundesliga football season. According to S\u00fcdwestrundfunk radio channel, photos showing fighting in Syria had been found on the suspect\u2019s phone and computer, although it was unclear whether he had taken them himself.</p> <p>Authorities in Denmark, Norway, Sweden and the Netherlands routinely take and examine mobile phones to help establish a refugee\u2019s identity if they have no formal documents with them when they enter the country. </p> <p>Danish immigration law authorises officials to temporarily confiscate phones if the devices are \u201cpresumed to be of importance in establishing a foreigner\u2019s identity\u201d. The provision predates a raft of tougher immigration controls introduced in Denmark earlier this year, including one that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/12/denmark-to-force-refugees-to-give-up-valuables-under-proposed-asylum-law\">allows police to seize</a> migrants\u2019 cash and some valuables to help pay for their accommodation. </p> <p><a href=\"http://politiken.dk/udland/fokus_int/Flygtningestroem/ECE3069835/politiet-tager-asylboerns-mobiler-ved-ankomst/\">Speaking to Politiken newspaper</a>, Richard Osterlund la Cour, a police spokesman, said: \u201cIf you come to the country and say you are from Syria, but have nothing but your face to prove it, your mobile phone is the best way to determine if you are telling the truth.\u201d</p> <p>The Danish practice made headlines earlier this year when a <a href=\"http://politiken.dk/udland/fokus_int/Flygtningestroem/ECE3069891/15-aarig-jeg-vil-bare-gerne-i-kontakt-med-min-familie/\">Politiken investigation revealed</a> that immigration officers had confiscated the mobile phones of 55 unaccompanied migrant children, with many having to wait up to a month for them to be returned. <br></p> <p>The pilot scheme is one of a number of anti-terror measures that De Maizi\u00e8re proposed after a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/26/germany-bavaria-police-attacks-munich-ansbach-wurzburg\">spate of violent attacks</a> in southern Germany at the start of August, which have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/29/one-eye-on-the-emergency-exit-the-anxious-mood-in-germany-and-france\">raised security fears</a> in the country.</p> <p>Other measures include increasing the number of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/25/germany-boosts-police-presence-warns-acts-of-terror-ansbach\">police and surveillance staff</a>, speeding up the deportation of foreign criminals and revoking German citizenship from dual nationals if they have been found fighting for militant groups abroad. De Maizi\u00e8re said he would explore ways of using recognition software for surveillance in public spaces and discuss ways in which to make it easier for doctors to tip off authorities about potential terror risks.</p> <p>The minister crucially distanced himself from calls to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/10/german-minister-to-propose-ban-on-full-face-veils-in-wake-of-attacks\">ban the full face veil</a> for women and abolish dual citizenship. The proposals are thought to be part of a <a href=\"http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-germany-security-idUKKCN10L0PW\">27-point Berlin declaration</a> set to be presented to the public on 18 August by Christian Democrat state interior ministers, some of whom are holding regional elections next month.</p> <p>De Maizi\u00e8re insisted the declaration, details of which were leaked to the press on Wednesday, had been merely a draft and he considered some of the more controversial measures to be problematic. \u201cYou cannot ban everything that you disapprove of. And I disapprove of the wearing of the burqa,\u201d he said.</p> <p>A report produced by the Bundestag\u2019s scientific service, and circulated among German MPs, points out than a move to ban the full-face veil would most likely be incompatible with the German constitution and likely to be rejected by the constitutional court.</p>",
  "<p>Donald Trump\u2019s golf resort in Aberdeenshire has admitted it failed to comply with strict data protection laws after not registering with the UK\u2019s privacy watchdog, the Guardian can reveal.</p> <p>The Information Commissioner\u2019s Office contacted staff at the \u00a330m resort near Aberdeen, Scotland, after it confirmed it was not registered under the Data Protection Act despite operating an extensive CCTV system and handling data on thousands of golfers and guests, its staff and suppliers.</p> <p>The resort insisted the failure was a \u201cclerical error\u201d, but the ICO is now being urged to launch a full investigation by residents, opposition politicians at Holyrood, and the film-maker Anthony Baxter, who directed You\u2019ve Been Trumped.

Of three cameras visible in its maintenance compound, one points directly at the access road to the home of David Milne, one of Trump\u2019s fiercest critics, who lives in a former coastguard station overlooking the course, and his neighbour Susie Munro, another opponent. As of last week, there was no visible sign warning visitors that CCTV was being used.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s critics fear the resort could use its CCTV systems to track their and guests\u2019 movements, even though Scotland\u2019s robust right to roam law entitles the public have a legal right to walk across the resort. Trump\u2019s staff vigorously denied using CCTV covertly. </p> <p>In a statement responding to questions from the Guardian about its use of CCTV cameras and storage of confidential data, Trump International Golf Course Scotland said: \u201cWe take the security of our employees and guests\u2019 personal data very seriously and comply with all aspects of the Data Protection Act. A clerical oversight has just been brought to our attention which is now being rectified.\u201d <br></p> <p>Asked about allegations that CCTV was used to track legitimate activity by the public on or next to the course, the company said: \u201cAs a public facility open to all, Trump International has CCTV cameras located at its entrance and around the public buildings within the estate, for the safety and security of its members, guests and staff.</p> <p>\u201cThe company has no need for cameras outwith those areas and has never had any cause to supply CCTV footage in any criminal proceedings.

Their treatment by the police, including being thrown against a car, was featured in the film.</p> <p>A rambler called Rohan Beyts, a retired social worker active in the Tripping Up Trump campaign group, was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/sep/12/film-makers-arrested-donald-trump-scottish-golf-resort\">charged</a> under the Civic Government (Scotland) Act for allegedly urinating in the dunes while she was out walking on the course with a fellow campaigner, Sue Edwards, in April.</p> <p><a href=\"https://theferret.scot/woman-charged-peeing-trump-golf-course/\">Beyts was told by police that she had been filmed by Trump staff</a> using their mobile phones ducking down behind a dune. As she and Edwards walked off the course, a photographer believed to work for a local paper jumped out of a car and photographed them.</p> <p>Beyts said prosecutors advised her in a statutory warning letter that the unproven charges would be put on record. She has refused to admit the charges and challenged the decision to issue a warning letter. \u201cI find it very uncomfortable,\u201d she said last week. \u201cWe always thought we were being watched. When they were building the course, every time we set foot on it [there were] security guards there instantly.\u201d</p> <p>Milne said the resort\u2019s failure to register under the DPA was \u201csymptomatic of the [resort\u2019s] entire approach to UK legislation\u201d. It had repeatedly built on the course without getting planning permission, only applying after buildings, walls or two flagpoles were in place.</p> <p>\u201cAn ICO investigation is required because of the track record of the organisation, because of the way it has harassed and attempted to intimidate both those who live on or near the estate and those who walk on to it,\u201d Milne said. \u201cThe ICO needs to investigate because it has done so elsewhere, when similar things have happened. It should be one law for all.\u201d</p> <p>Baxter, who was not prosecuted for allegedly threatening Trump staff during his filming \u2013 a charge he disputed \u2013 said he had made a subject access request under the Data Protection Act asking for all the information the company holds on him.</p> <p>\u201cI have on a number of occasions filmed around and near the Trump links property and am concerned that my image may have been captured on numerous occasions and I am concerned also how these images are being stored and used,\u201d he said. <br></p> <ul> <li>This article was amended on 11 August to replace a picture showing Trump\u2019s other golf course in Scotland.</li> </ul>",

Particularly relevant in light of Jess Phillips\u2019s comments today, the union notes that women are in the majority among its membership.</p> <p>In response to the news, Corbyn said: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I am proud to have the support of Unison members. Their incredible work, against the backdrop of cuts, privatisation and outsourcing of public services, keeps the services we all rely on running - from the NHS to local government.</p> <p>We need a Labour Party that gives them a voice - that halts and reverses the cuts, privatisation, and outsourcing that are ripping Britain\u2019s communities and services apart. </p> <p>The next Labour government will create a million new jobs and build a million new homes - and we will end the public sector pay cap overnight. In the NHS and across the public sector, we will push back against outsourcing and privatisation, and invest properly in staff and infrastructure. Our plan to rebuild and transform Britain so that no one and nowhere is left behind will restore dignity, jobs and quality to our public services.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57ac763de4b0fe7550974cc4\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-11T13:01:50.848Z\">2.01pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The court of appeal is just about to get going again after its lunchtime recess. In the meantime, Jess Phillips, the Labour MP, who has been vocal about her opposition to Corbyn and what she believes is male-domination in the Labour party, has written for the Guardian about the lack of female candidates for forthcoming mayoral elections. </p> <p>Phillips accuses Corbyn of placing more importance on securing jobs for his \u201cbrothers in arms\u201d than advancing the cause of women and says he failed to respond to her attempts to discuss the issue with him. She says: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>People tell me I should just get behind Jeremy, work with him. On this, I tried. I would have gladly organised events in the regions for women members and councillors. I would have gone with Jeremy, stood shoulder to shoulder on platforms, encouraged women to give it a go, and offered tips and mentoring about being a representative and standing for selection. I was willing to work hard to do something that would have made Jeremy look good.</p> <p>I\u2019m left disappointed and deflated again. I don\u2019t know why Jeremy didn\u2019t answer. I don\u2019t know why his office ignored my advances. They never ignored me before and haven\u2019t since. He told me he was a feminist. I suppose feminism is out of the window when your brothers in arms want the jobs.

The NEC is afforded by the rule book sufficiently broad powers that it can actually override the rules framework in a particular case, if it so wishes. </p> <p>\u201cThey are the guardian of the constitution.

The case will be heard by Lord Justice Beatson, sitting with Lady Justice Macur and Lord Justice Sales. </p> <p>There has been speculation that Labour general secretary, Iain McNicol, could face being ousted if the party loses its appeal as divisions within the party deepen still further. </p> <p>Tonight, Corbyn and his challenger, Owen Smith will go head to head in Gateshead, for the second hustings of the leadership race, which will give both men the chance to spell out their policy platforms. </p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-08-11T11:48:42.789Z\">at 12.48pm BST</time></p>  </div>",
  "<p>In a GP surgery in a Welsh village, Dr Helen Ash is delivering bad news: terminal illness, two months to live, everyone\u2019s worst nightmare. And this is how the doctor (played by the always excellent Romola Garai) dispatches the information to her traumatised patient. \u201cYou left it too late,\u201d she says, brusque, bored and wearing her coat. \u201cThe signs were there.\u201d </p> <p>The patient calls her a \u201cheartless cow\u201d and informs her that everyone in the village thinks she is \u201ccold\u201d, which is a bit like saying Donald Trump is self-absorbed. In the first moments of Matthew Broughton\u2019s taut and visceral nine-part conspiracy thriller (<a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b07mxgxl\">Tracks</a>, BBC Radio 4) our minds are made up. Dr Helen Ash is awful. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/live/2015/sep/11/romola-garai-webchat-measure-for-measure-young-vic\">Romola Garai webchat \u2013 your questions answered on motherhood, feminism and Sandra Bullock</a> </p> </aside>  <p>She is also the heroine, and we next encounter her at the scene of a plane crash, pulling bodies from the wreckage and soothing the dying. Now she is plucky, capable, compassionate. And the plot has thickened. Helen was on her way to the airport to meet her estranged father who had left a JJ Abrams-esque message on her voicemail saying that \u201cto go forwards we must go backwards\u201d. And lo, as is the law of all post-Abrams thriller series, the action dutifully shuttles between the crash, which is as graphic as radio gets, and Helen\u2019s numbed account of it to the police.</p> <p>Turns out her father, whom she had never met, was on the plane\u2026 or was he? All the tropes are here: the twisty time structure, the plane crash that appears to be a set up, characters who are hiding something, a medical conference somehow connecting all these disparate people, and a shadowy organisation called Mayflower. Predictable, but gripping nonetheless. </p> <p>And some of the writing is lovely: spare, elegant and unforced. Like Helen\u2019s description of the plane \u201crippling up the earth\u201d and how \u201cone of the wings took out a herd of cows\u201d.

Even after showing such bravery, she is awful, saying to her husband when he comes to collect her from the police station, \u201cI don\u2019t love you any more.\u201d To which he replies, \u201cYou say that all the time.\u201d To which she snaps, \u201cShut up.\u201d Yet, and this is to Garai\u2019s credit, she is not wholly unlikable.<br></p> <p>This intriguing opener was called The Nervus Vagus, but only towards the end did we learn what this is: the most complex nerve descending from our brains that \u201cholds us together and connects us to ourselves\u201d.

The actor, who turned 40 last month, is wearing a black leather jacket over a grey vest, grey jeans and trainers. She has long chestnut hair, which she gathers periodically into an improvised ponytail, and freckles on her nose.</p> <p>In The Artist, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/may/25/berenice-bejo-the-past-artist-interview\">Oscar-winning homage to the silent era</a>, she was Peppy Miller, a movie extra who rose to the top faster than bubbles in champagne. The camera fell unambiguously in love with Bejo, and millions of cinemagoers followed suit. Bejo was already married to the film\u2019s writer-director, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/michel-hazanavicius\">Michel Hazanavicius</a>; the couple live with their two children, a son of eight and a daughter who is almost five, as well as Hazanavicius\u2019s daughters, aged 18 and 12, from his previous marriage. They met in 2005 while shooting the spoof <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYobrwvSs9Q\">OSS 117: Cairo, Nest of Spies</a>, starring <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/shortcuts/2012/jan/24/french-adore-jean-dujardin\">Jean Dujardin</a>, later to be the star of The Artist, as a suave, moronic secret agent.

Western ignorance and insensitivity were the targets. Even so, could the film be made now? She gives a gasp. \u201cIt\u2019s funny you ask that. I was wondering also. I will ask Michel tonight what he thinks. I\u2019m not sure.\u201d</p> <p>OSS 117 opened in April 2006, just two months after the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo published an anti-fundamentalist cartoon of a sorrowful Muhammad saying: <a href=\"http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/AimeeParLesCons.jpg\">\u201c<em>Cest dur d\u2019\u00eatre aim\u00e9 par des cons</em>\u201d (\u201cIt\u2019s hard being loved by jerks\u201d)</a>. \u201cPeople asked me when OSS 117 was released: \u2018Are you not scared?\u2019\u201d she recalls. \u201cI thought, \u2018Have you even seen the film?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Hazanavicius caused controversy when he wrote a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/nov/19/letter-to-isis-michel-hazanavicius-the-artist-director-sex-explicit\">defiant open letter to Islamic State after the 13 November attacks in Paris</a>. \u201cHere in France, what we love is life,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAnd the pleasures that go with it. For us, between being born and dying as late as possible, the main idea is to fuck, laugh, eat, play, fuck, drink, read, take a nap, fuck, talk, eat, argue, paint, fuck, take a walk \u2026 read, fuck, give, fuck, sleep, watch movies, scratch our balls, fart to make our friends laugh, but above all to fuck, and eventually get a nice little handjob.\u201d He showed it to his wife in advance. \u201cI was, like: \u2018Hey, you\u2019re fucking a lot!\u2019\u201d she laughs.</p> <p>She suggested he post it on Facebook. \u201cWe didn\u2019t think it would spread all around the world.\u201d After the disbelief, fear set in. Then after a few days we said: \u2018Islamic State might have something to do other than shoot us and our children.\u2019\u201d The family lives not far from the Bataclan theatre, which was the main focus of the attacks.</p> <p>\u201cTwo days after it happened, we were out having dinner in those streets. Two days after that, we were at the theatre. I said to Michel: \u2018Do we just keep going?\u2019 He said: \u2018We have to.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Will there be any more letters? \u201cIf he wants to write another one, we would post it. We cannot live with fear in our bodies. That\u2019s not my character. I can\u2019t stop living.\u201d</p> <p>At times like these she thinks of her parents. Her father was a film-maker who specialised in Bu\u00f1uel-esque comedies; her mother trained as a lawyer. They fled <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/may/17/jorge-rafael-videla\">Jorge Rafael Videla\u2019s dictatorship in Argentina</a> in the late 1970s and moved with Bejo, her sister and their two step-siblings from Buenos Aires to Paris. She was three at the time. \u201cThey survived. I keep going because that\u2019s the way I\u2019ve been taught.\u201d</p> <p>The similarities between the family she came from and the one she has created for herself are striking. Both contain two children from earlier relationships and two from the present one. And I can\u2019t be the first journalist to point out that her father and her husband are both film-makers. \u201cAlso, my dad\u2019s name is Miguel and sometimes I say his name when I mean Michel.\u201d That\u2019s almost too Freudian. \u201cI know,\u201d she sighs. \u201cYou cannot marry your dad, so you marry the closest thing to him.\u201d</p> <p>Though it was The Artist in 2011 that brought Bejo international success, she had been acting for more than a decade, including the likeable medieval romp <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YbwIcZmhSk\">A Knight\u2019s Tale, with Heath Ledger, in 2001</a>. One of her favourite roles, she says, was in Most Promising Young Actress, a French comedy from 2000, in which she played a girl who rejects her father\u2019s hairdressing business to pursue an acting career. It can\u2019t be a coincidence that she singles out this story of dads and daughters, especially since its director, G\u00e9rard Jugnot, also played her on-screen father. The roles of parent, film-maker and husband are forever merging in her life.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"47fa6c9b4c54091c7317a577a7afcc84c7e7847d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/47fa6c9b4c54091c7317a577a7afcc84c7e7847d/0_236_4096_2458/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Berenice Bejo and Abdul Khalim Mamutsiev in The Search\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Berenice Bejo and Abdul Khalim Mamutsiev in The Search.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>She is currently midway through shooting the comedy Redoubtable, her fourth collaboration with her husband. And \u2013 what do you know? \u2013 this one is about a director. Not just any director: Jean-Luc Godard, played by Louis Garrel. \u201cIt\u2019s set around 1968,\u201d explains Bejo, who plays a friend of Godard\u2019s. \u201cHe had just made La Chinoise, which wasn\u2019t well received. People said: \u2018Why don\u2019t you make another Le M\u00e9pris?\u2019\u201d Not unlike what happened when she and Hazanavicius followed The Artist in 2014 with <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TeHf_c94tFA\">The Search</a>, an unloved drama set in war-torn Chechnya. \u201cRedoubtable is about Godard but there are moments when I can see it is about Michel, too,\u201d she says fondly. \u201cPeople ask him, \u2018When are you going to do another comedy with Jean Dujardin?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>In the space of three years, Bejo and Hazanavicius experienced the extremes of critical and public reaction. She describes in escalating steps the realisation that The Artist was becoming a phenomenon. First, Harvey Weinstein bought the movie. \u201cI didn\u2019t really know what that meant. Michel said it was a good sign.\u201d</p> <p>Then there was the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/may/16/cannes-2011-the-artist-michael-footnote-review\">rapturous premiere at Cannes</a>. \u201cWe were like, \u2018Oh cool. Maybe more than 10 people will see this one.\u201d It was when the film bagged 10 Oscar nominations, including one for Bejo herself, that she thought: \u201cThis is big.\u201d (It later won five, including best picture, best director and best actor, as well as six Baftas and three Golden Globes.) But it was never about prizes for her. \u201cThe exciting thing is what happens after. What sort of movies will you be able to make? What comes next?\u201d</p> <p>She answers by using her hand to mime a nose-diving plane. \u201cIt\u2019s great to get everything. It doesn\u2019t feel so great to get nothing.\u201d For every cheer that greeted The Artist at Cannes, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/may/21/the-search-cannes-review-berenice-bejo\">The Search received a boo</a>. Hazanavicius had lost his knack for visual precision and eloquence, but it felt also as if the couple were being punished for their change of direction. \u201cIn each case, it was too much. Too much love and then too much hate. The Artist was not the best film of its year, and The Search was not the worst. You realise you\u2019re in the middle of something that has nothing to do with you.\u201d</p> <p>It all came back to her earlier this year as she read the coverage from Cannes of Sean Penn\u2019s new film, The Last Face, which was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/may/20/the-last-face-review-sean-penn-charlize-theron-crass-romance-cannes\">similarly mocked for its earnestness</a>. \u201cHe said: \u2018I\u2019m sad because now I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m going to be able to sell my film.\u2019 I thought, \u2018Well, Sean, you won\u2019t. You\u2019re not going to be able to do anything with it because you got booed. Sorry.

  "<p>Last week, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2016/aug/04/how-legitimate-marriages-have-become-home-office-honey-traps\" title=\"\">in this column</a>, I recounted James\u2019s story. Preparing to get married at my church, and having received a letter from the register office to the effect that it accepted it wasn\u2019t a sham marriage, he had nonetheless been taken from his bed early one morning by the Home Office. James (not his real name) having got into the system through his marriage licence application, the Home Office\u2019s wedding gift was to lock him up&#xa0;for overstaying his visa. And when it unceremoniously grabbed him, it didn\u2019t say where it was taking him \u2013 it turned out to be the Verne immigration removal centre, in Portland, Dorset. On Wednesday, I went to see him.</p> <p>This, in itself, is unusual. On average, detainees receive about two visits a month in immigration removal centres. In the Verne, the average is 0.2 visits a month. The place is so far away from the cities from which many of the inmates have been taken, and from which their family, friends and solicitors have to travel, it has been dubbed Britain\u2019s loneliest migrant centre. From London, it\u2019s a three-hour train journey, then about an hour on the bus to the Isle of Portland, then a marathon climb, rising nearly 500ft to the imposing stone gate, built by convict labour in the 19th century. Thomas Hardy called Portland \u201cthe Gibraltar of Wessex\u201d. The view from the top of the road is magnificent. The glorious Chesil beach stretches out beneath you. The sun glistens off Weymouth bay. It was in these waters that Ben Ainslie won Olympic gold for sailing back in 2012. The whole place is full of pink staycation Brits with rubber rings and fish and chips.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2016/aug/04/how-legitimate-marriages-have-become-home-office-honey-traps\">How legitimate marriages have become Home Office honey traps | Giles Fraser | Loose canon</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But James has never seen the view, not once. Despite the fact that the Verne is the highest thing for miles, the windows look out onto more walls and barbed wire. In here you could be anywhere, and nowhere. We meet in the visitors\u2019 centre. Some couples stare at each other, not knowing what to say. Others make do without privacy to touch each other as best they can. Kids scribble in their colouring books. There is a broken table-football game and a vending machine. There were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/apr/04/suicide-attempts-uk-immigration-removal-centres-all-time-high-home-office-figures\" title=\"\">393&#xa0;recorded suicide attempts at immigration removal centres</a> in 2015, up 11% from the year before. On average, more than one a day.</p> <p>I could tell that the shy and softly spoken James was frightened by the place. Some of the inmates are considerably more boisterous than he is. Some have histories of violence. For all his time in this country, since he came here as a student, James has never troubled the law. He is ridiculously out of place in what is, to all intents and purposes, a prison. And a prison with indefinite detention. He hasn\u2019t been sleeping well, he&#xa0;says, but the guards are nice.</p> <p>I find visiting difficult and am not always very good at it. When in hospital myself, I generally hate people coming to see me, staying too long, inventing small talk, me not being able to get away from them. I think I\u2019d shrivel up and die if a well-intentioned chaplain popped by for a cheery word. But the only thing worse than people coming to see you is them not coming to see you.</p> <p>James and I speak a bit about his legal case, but we could have done that on the phone (the policy is to take away their mobile phones and replace them with the prison\u2019s own, which do not have in-built cameras). I agree to post surety for him when he goes to court. We discuss the wedding plans \u2013 what a place to be choosing hymns. At least it doesn\u2019t look like he is being bundled onto a plane, thank God. We have a hug.</p> <p>The real challenge with visiting is having the antennae sensitive enough to pick up what the other person wants from you. Sometimes they want an emissary from home with a bit of gentle gossip. Sometimes they want that conversation everyone has been avoiding. Sometimes they want another person to pray with. It can feel very exposed going to see someone empty handed, without particular things to discuss. But mostly, people just want someone else to be there, listening, giving a damn. That easy.

Previously, they received \u00a37 an hour, plus \u00a31 for each delivery, across London, while workers outside the capital were paid slightly less.</p> <p>Deliveroo, which raised $275m (\u00a3212m) from investors this month, said it would roll out the pay terms from next week and claimed that couriers had responded positively in early trials.</p> <p>\u201cWhat we have seen from previous trials that we have been running in other parts of London is that riders have reacted positively to the trial, and fees rise to more than twice what they were over a lunch or dinner, compared to the old payment model,\u201d it said.</p> <p>A photo published on Twitter on Thursday morning appeared to show a protest by Deliveroo couriers in West Hampstead, north-west London. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Tweet showing Deliveroo riders in Hampstead\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-partner=&quot;tweetdeck&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;About 50 &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Deliveroo&quot;&gt;@Deliveroo&lt;/a&gt; drivers tooting down &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/whampstead?src=hash&quot;&gt;#whampstead&lt;/a&gt; high street.

Some have suggested that the new structure will make it hard for them to earn as much as they took home while on hourly pay rates.</p> <p>Outside London, one rider said he and his co-workers had been given 48 hours\u2019 notice of a meeting telling them that they would be part of a trial starting this week.</p> <p>He said he could see why the hourly rate was being dropped. \u201cI have been sat in my city doing nothing waiting for orders and so they are paying me for nothing,\u201d the driver said.</p> <p>However, he expressed concerns over whether the structure would pay as well as Deliveroo claimed and said the removal of schedules for workers, which determine the timing of delivery shifts, would have an impact.</p> <p>\u201cThey said they had data from an area similar to mine where they had trialled this and gave an average delivery time,\u201d the driver said. \u201cHowever, this only included picking up and doing the delivery, and not the time spent cycling/driving back to the \u2018zone centre\u2019, where all the restaurants are.</p> <p>\u201cThey are getting rid of the staff schedule and instead you can log in whenever you want; this means that at peak times there will obviously be more people logging in and therefore fewer orders per driver.\u201d</p> <p>In a statement, Deliveroo said: \u201cAfter feedback from our rider surveys, we learnt that the most important thing to our riders about the job is flexibility. We\u2019ve designed this trial to enhance flexibility, allowing riders to work whenever they want by logging on and off as desired.</p> <p>\u201cThe 2.2km size of each delivery zone has been designed with delivery distance and time in mind. Following extensive testing, this zone size was found to be the optimum size for ensuring that riders can complete 2-3 orders an hour safely and with plenty of time, while still receiving fees of more than \u00a310 per hour across the lunch and dinner times our riders work.\u201d<br></p> <p>The company said that the trial was designed to \u201cbetter reflect the way that riders work with us\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cAlong with this increased flexibility, we\u2019ve seen average hourly fees for riders in previous trials rise to more than 2.1 times the previous payment model at our busiest times,\u201d Deliveroo said.</p> <p>Earlier this year, a Deliveroo worker told the Guardian the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/jun/15/he-truth-about-working-for-deliveroo-uber-and-the-on-demand-economy\">most he had made</a> was \u00a332 in a three-hour shift and that customers did not tend to pay tips on top of this. </p> <p>Riders for Deliveroo were asked to sign contracts banning them <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2016/jul/25/deliveroo-workers-contracts-ban-access-to-employment-tribunals\">from taking claims</a> over their employment status to court.

  "<p>The 1820s is often seen as the moment when an <a href=\"http://www.cambridge.org/gb/academic/subjects/history/history-ideas-and-intellectual-history/taming-chance\">enthusiasm</a> for numbers started to take hold. Ever since, there has been a growing impulse to understand people through statistics, giving rise to an <a href=\"http://press.princeton.edu/titles/853.html\">explosion</a> or <a href=\"http://www.cambridge.org/gb/academic/subjects/history/history-ideas-and-intellectual-history/taming-chance\">avalanche</a> of systems for social measurement, facilitated by what Theodor Porter memorably described as a <a href=\"http://press.princeton.edu/titles/5653.html\">trust in numbers</a>.<br></p> <p>Over almost 200 years, our lives have been measured with <a href=\"https://www.opendemocracy.net/ourkingdom/david-beer/when-%D4special-measures%D5-become-ordinary\">increasing intensity</a>: from household, health, mortality and crime data, to Fitbits, smartphone apps, performance and consumer analytics. When thinking about the role of metrics today, it is still common to turn to notions of trust, faith and objectivity to understand how numbers shape our lives. We tend to think of metrics as being powerful because of their apparent trustworthiness. But do we really trust numbers? Perhaps a better question to ask would be whether we need to trust numbers for them to exercise power over us?</p> <p>We can see how numbers might provide us with objective and accurate accounts of the world. For example, we might, if we were inclined, ask how much the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-32531942\">sea is worth</a>? And we would get an answer. Valuing the sea is an extreme example of calculative thinking, but the same could be said for many parts of social life.</p> <p>We know the world through numbers. Numbers are immediate. Numbers are seen to be authoritative and legitimate because of their perceived innate objectivity. But is this still the case? The recent <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/reality-check/2016/may/23/does-the-eu-really-cost-the-uk-350m-a-week\">EU referendum</a> saw various numbers contested, distrusted and cherry-picked. When there are such high profile debates over the validity of numbers, can they still be seen as objective?</p> <p>There is a growing sense in British politics that numbers can be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2016/may/16/lies-damned-lies-and-brexit-statistics\">mobilised or manipulated to promote certain agendas</a>. This is perhaps linked to a more general <a href=\"http://europe.newsweek.com/trump-gove-both-trash-experts-476291?rm=eu\">scepticism towards experts</a>. With the escalating use of metrics across all areas of our lives, we have seen the power of numbers shifting from being about faith to being about persuasion. It is no longer what numerical measures tell us, but what metrics <em>tell us to do</em>.</p> <p>When we look at the way that numbers are used, we see increasingly calculative modes of reasoning deployed in our workplaces, in our consumer behaviour, and in determining whether schools, hospitals, universities, countries are failing or succeeding. A similar logic applies to the way that we quantify our bodies, lifestyles and friendships.</p> <p>Everything can be captured in proxy form by metrics: from our <a href=\"http://www.talentmetrics.io/\">talent</a> and <a href=\"https://www.versobooks.com/books/2162-the-happiness-industry\">emotions</a>, to our <a href=\"https://www.allbusiness.com/slideshow/16-simple-ways-to-track-and-measure-employee-productivity-16799830-1.html\">productivity</a>, <a href=\"https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/teaching-excellence-framework-tef-everything-you-need-to-know\">teaching skills</a>, <a href=\"http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2015/11/25/being-trained-by-twitter-stats/\">networking ability</a>, <a href=\"http://uk.pcmag.com/apps/42450/guide/the-25-best-fitness-apps-for-2016\">fitness</a>, and so on. As I write this piece, there is a discussion on the radio about whether it is possible to measure uncertainty and confidence in the economy through the <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/pmi.asp\">purchase manager\u2019s index</a>. </p> <p>Metrics don\u2019t just measure; they also produce. They are used to establish and cement ideals, against which we are then ranked or compared. Everything from our sleep patterns and calorie burns, to our riskiness, credit worthiness or market share. Numbers cajole us into choices and behaviours: how to work, how to live, how to consume.</p> <p>Today then, it is not so much about trust in numbers as it is about the use of metrics to persuade and push. It is about the emotional response we have to metrics and their <a href=\"http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2015/07/22/seeing-data-how-people-engage-with-data-visualisations/\">visualisations</a>, as well as to the technical or calculative insights that they bring. We may well know that some metrics are misrepresentations, and we may not trust them, but they can nonetheless provoke behaviours and be used to discipline and govern choices.</p> <p>This applies also to the world of universities and research, where <a href=\"https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings\">rankings and league tables</a> become material realities that contribute to student, staff and funder choices. We know that if we were to look carefully, the logic of a given league table will dissolve in our hands, yet it remains powerful in framing our understandings, choices and notions of status.</p> <p>A <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbctrust/our_work/editorial_standards/impartiality/statistics\">BBC Trust review</a> this week, chaired by Dame Jil Matheson, urged the broadcaster to do more to explain competing statistical claims in its coverage. But next time we are reflecting on the reliability of a given number or ranking, we should think not only about whether we trust it, but of how it may persuade us to do certain things. Where we lack trust, we might try to game certain metrics or subvert them, but even then their persuasive power is still guiding us. </p> <p>Even where our faith or trust in numbers might have been eroded, the persuasive power of metrics appears to be escalating. Metrics don\u2019t need our trust in order to be a powerful presence in our lives; they just need our attention.<br></p> <p><em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/davidgbeer?lang=en-gb\">David Beer</a> is reader in sociology at the University of York.

  "<p>When Adil El Arbi and Bilall Fallah first read Dirk Bracke\u2019s novel Black, they sarcastically joked that it would be their \u201cticket to Hollywood\u201d, never imagining that such a thing was possible. As second-generation Moroccan-Belgians, they found that Black and its sequel \u2013 a sort of West Side Story set in the immigrant suburbs of Brussels \u2013 spoke to them. But as Arab teenagers seeking to break into Belgium\u2019s tiny, overwhelmingly white film industry, the odds were stacked against them. Especially as it turned out someone else was already making a film of the book. Added to which, at the time, El Arbi and Fallah were in their first year at film school, which they duly flunked.</p> <p>And yet, 10 years later, here they are, on a blindingly sunny rooftop in downtown Los Angeles, thanks to Black \u2013 <a href=\"http://black-themovie.com/en/\">which, of course, they ended up making after all</a>. It\u2019s difficult to imagine two more disparate places in the popular imagination than Hollywood and Molenbeek \u2013 the Belgian suburb where Black was shot, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/16/radicalisation-molenbeek-terrorist-brussels-belgian\">now synonymous with Islamist terrorism</a>. All of which makes their journey one of the most astonishing in recent cinema.</p> <p>Yet far from being culture-shocked, the pair seem completely at home. Fallah is even wearing an LA Dodgers baseball cap back-to-front. They have only been here three months, but between their street style, their Americanised English and the way they converse in tandem like a rap duo, you would never guess they were foreigners.</p> <p>As they re-enact the moment they got the call from Hollywood, they look and sound just like locals.</p> <p>Fallah: \u201cI was in my apartment [in Brussels], around midnight. I looked on my phone and it said \u2018Beverly Hills\u2019. What the fuck? \u2018Hello, it\u2019s Daniel Rappaport from Management 360.\u2019 I was, like, \u2018Is this for real?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>El Arbi: \u201cWe were like: \u2018Oh shit! American voice! Cool!\u2019\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/nov/13/black-film-gang-drama-brussels-cinema-belgium-riot-police\">Riots break out at cinema showing acclaimed teen street gang drama</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Fallah: \u201cThen they asked us what kind of movies we wanted to make. We said, \u2018Big shit! Gladiator or Star Wars.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>El Arbi: \u201cThey said come to LA. We said, \u2018We got no money y\u2019all.\u2019 So they came over to Brussels for 24 hours, we made a deal, then it was Toronto [film festival].\u201d</p> <p>Fallah: \u201cIn Toronto, that was the first taste we got of Hollywood. We saw big actors like Idris Elba and Naomi Watts. It was, like, \u2018Holy shit, it\u2019s becoming real.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s about to get realer. They are about to begin shooting in South Central LA: a pilot for the FX network for a series on the city\u2019s 1980s crack cocaine epidemic. Titled Snowfall, it is being produced by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jul/29/john-singleton-police-brutality-black-people-slavery-racism-oscar\">the legendary John Singleton, director of 1990s classic Boyz N the Hood</a> \u2013 a movie Bilall and El Arbi cite as one of their inspirations. Snowfall could almost be Boyz N the Hood the series, it seems. Other reference points they cite include The Wire and The Shield.</p> <p>In their round of Hollywood meetings, they also talked with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/aug/09/jerry-bruckheimer-lone-ranger\">uber-producer Jerry Bruckheimer, the man behind Pirates of the Caribbean, Top Gun and innumerable other hits</a>. \u201cWe asked him: \u2018Hey! Can we do Bad Boys 3?\u2019\u201d says El Arbi. \u201cHe said: \u2018There\u2019s a director already on that.\u2019 He doesn\u2019t talk a lot.\u201d But Bruckheimer did ask them to direct Beverly Hills Cop 4, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/may/08/beverly-hills-cop-4-pulled-from-release-schedule\">Eddie Murphy\u2019s long-stalled comeback vehicle</a>, which is now set for release next year. They haven\u2019t met Murphy yet, but apparently he personally approved them. \u201cSo that\u2019s already a big-ass honour,\u201d says Fallah.</p> <p>El Arbi: \u201cWe can\u2019t say too much but it\u2019s not an accident that they chose us. It\u2019s more Detroit than Beverly Hills, that\u2019s the general idea.\u201d</p> <p>Fallah: \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a comedy, obviously, but it\u2019s going to also be edgy and harsh and real.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"48f89feb3bdfc5cc9bffe4d5916d50852480fd68\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/48f89feb3bdfc5cc9bffe4d5916d50852480fd68/483_451_1286_771/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bilall Fallah, left, and Adil El Arbi: \u2018They said come to LA.

Black, which went on to win the Discovery award at Toronto, hinges on the romance between a Moroccan petty criminal and a recently arrived Congolese girl, which sparks a war between their respective gangs, the 1080 and the Black Bronx. It\u2019s a stylish, technically slick movie, full of dynamic camera moves and scored by a blend of Belgian hip-hop and north African beats (plus a local cover of Amy Winehouse\u2019s Back to Black). Yet it depicts an all-too-believable landscape of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/nov/13/black-film-gang-drama-brussels-cinema-belgium-riot-police\">gang violence, criminality, discrimination, deprivation and rape</a>.</p> <p>Black\u2019s closest equivalent, and an influence the film-makers readily acknowledge, would be Mathieu Kassovitz\u2019s La Haine, which pulled off a similar trick of capturing both the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/may/03/la-haine-film-sequel-20-years-on-france\">youthful energy and the circumscribed prospects of Europe\u2019s immigrant margins</a>, treading a fine line between commercial entertainment and gritty realism. \u201cThat [La Haine] was 1995,\u201d says El Arbi, \u201cand when you look around, nothing\u2019s really changed. It\u2019s actually worse.\u201d Ironically, Black has been banned in France, he points out. \u201cThey said the overall atmosphere and theme of the movie doesn\u2019t match with the political climate of the country.\u201d</p> <p>El Arbi and Fallah make no apologies for wanting to make a commercially minded movie rather than a sombre social-realist drama. \u201cThis should be told to as many people as possible,\u201d says El Arbi, \u201ceven though it\u2019s a really harsh kind of story. If you\u2019re gonna do social commentary and not have cinematic value to it, then not a lot of people are going to see it.\u201d</p> <p>But there\u2019s a palpable authenticity to Black. The story unfolds in subway stations and housing estates, primarily in Molenbeek and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2013/nov/03/brussels-matonge-quarter-belgium\">Matonge, respectively the north-African Arab and sub-Saharan African</a> (primarily Congolese) districts of Brussels. The movie was shot on the streets and cast from them, too. And to the directors\u2019 credit, there\u2019s barely a false note in the performances, particularly from the two leads, Martha Canga Antonio and Aboubakr Bensaihi.</p> <p>Fallah: \u201cYou don\u2019t have Moroccan or black actors. Certainly not between 15 and 21 years old. So, out of necessity, we had to go into the streets and into schools and on social media to find those actors.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZh33h7eBBU\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/CZh33h7eBBU?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>El Arbi: \u201cBelgian cinema really is white. You go to casting agencies and acting schools \u2013 everybody\u2019s white. We got together 400 people and selected the 16 best.\u201d</p> <p>Fallah: \u201cAnd for every character, there was a lot of choice. There\u2019s so much talent walking around.\u201d</p> <p>How did they get such good performances out of them?</p> <p>El Arbi: \u201cThe thing we said to every person was, \u2018Did you ever lie to your mother to go out? Or lie to your teacher?\u2019 And then they knew, \u2018Ah, OK. Actors are liars!\u2019\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s clear that the directors know this landscape intimately. Growing up in Belgium (El Arbi is 30, Fallah 28), they experienced the same prejudices and disadvantages their young cast face today. \u201cAntwerp was really one of the most racist cities in Europe,\u201d says Fallah, who grew up there. \u201cIt was the golden age of the Flemish Block, the racist party which won every fucking election during the 1990s. The only reason they never had power is because all the other parties had to club together and form a group against them.\u201d He went to a predominantly white, Catholic school. \u201cIn the beginning, you don\u2019t realise you\u2019re different. You think you\u2019re all the same, but after 9/11 happened, you came to school and everybody was, like, \u2018Are you happy now?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>El Arbi, who grew up in Brussels, also remembers that time. \u201cWe knew back then, it was gonna be a suckass 10 years for us. We didn\u2019t imagine 15 years later it would be even worse.\u201d</p> <p>Fallah and El Arbi both have family in Molenbeek. Both are saddened at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/15/molenbeek-the-brussels-borough-in-the-spotlight-after-paris-attacks\">the district\u2019s current infamy as \u201cjihadi central\u201d</a>, owing to the fact that many of those responsible for Islamist attacks across Europe hailed from there. Belgium\u2019s policy of \u201cghettoising\u201d its immigrant communities in discrete areas is part of the problem, they say. They describe Molenbeek as \u201ca different country\u201d. The stores are all Moroccan; only Arabic or French are heard on the streets. It\u2019s similar with Matonge. \u201cIt\u2019s like visiting Africa,\u201d says Fallah. \u201cBut if you go one street to the right, you\u2019re in a different world. That\u2019s typically Brussels.\u201d The only white faces we see in Black are those of police officers.</p> <p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t take people into society, you create a little bubble that doesn\u2019t interact with the real world, then you create those monsters,\u201d he says. \u201cEven if probably 90% of the people there are just normal people working and struggling.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"aba43f90644060c064596ccfb4d519877e1023a7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aba43f90644060c064596ccfb4d519877e1023a7/0_29_850_510/500.jpg\" alt=\"El Arbi and Fallah on set of Black.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">El Arbi and Fallah on set of Black.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Johan Voets</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThere\u2019s no trust,\u201d El Arbi adds, \u201cIt\u2019s not inclusive. The people that were in charge said, \u2018We\u2019re not gonna help you, but we\u2019re not gonna bother you either. That is the most deadly combination ever. If you just let things happen, it\u2019s gonna be tough for good people to do good stuff and it\u2019s gonna be easy for evil people to do the evil stuff.\u201d</p> <p>Black exposes more than one faultline running through Europe as a whole and Belgium in particular. On top of Islamophobia and racial discrimination (although tensions between Moroccan and Congolese communities are relatively rare in real life, they point out), the country is riven by a giant cultural divide: between the northern, Dutch-speaking Flemish community and the southern, French-speaking community. Thus, there\u2019s an extra layer of social nuance in terms of language, El Arbi explains. \u201cIf you talk French on the streets with your buddies, then you\u2019re cool, but if you talk Flemish, then you\u2019re a sellout. Flemish is the language of the rich people.\u201d By the time Black adds in generational and gender divides, you are left wondering how Belgian society holds together at all.</p> <p>Fallah: \u201cBelgium doesn\u2019t have an identity. You don\u2019t have a big history like France or Holland. Belgium is a young country.\u201d</p> <p>El Arbi: \u201cIt\u2019s like a buffer, made by the UK and Germany.\u201d</p> <p>Fallah: \u201cIt\u2019s artificial. It\u2019s two worlds in one that they want to keep together.\u201d</p> <p>El Arbi: \u201cAnd when you\u2019re 15 and young, you want to have an identity. You want something clear. Blacks, Moroccans, they\u2019ll never feel 100% Belgian. Even Belgians don\u2019t feel 100% Belgian. But drop them in Morocco or Congo, they will never be 100% either. So a gang or an extremist organisation can say: \u2018Come with us. You will have a name. You will be something. You are 1080 or Black Bronx \u2013 or Isis.\u201d</p> <p>The two film-makers formed their own gang at film school, being not just the only two non-white students but also the only ones with unashamedly commercial ambitions. Not that they don\u2019t worship the likes of Jean-Luc Godard, Michael Haneke and Lars Von Trier as well, they hasten to add.</p> <p>El Arbi: \u201cIt was pre-hipster, but they were hipsters doing hipster movies \u2013 poetic bullshit that you don\u2019t understand with no action in it, no conflict either, no ending. Just one character struggling with himself, and some water, some cryptic dialogue, some closeup shaky shit. Oh man!\u201d</p> <p>Fallah: \u201cWe were the only two Moroccans, but we were also the only two who wanted to go to Hollywood, and we referenced, like, Steven Spielberg ...\u201d</p> <p>El Arbi: \u201c... Jerry Bruckheimer. That was, like, the big \u2018no\u2019 word. You don\u2019t mention Jerry Bruckheimer\u2019s name there. That\u2019s why we clicked together so well.\u201d</p> <p>Fallah: \u201cIt was us against the world.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"be0f6226aa537d93b89593386e4d84592246f35f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/be0f6226aa537d93b89593386e4d84592246f35f/57_0_1685_1011/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Still from Black.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Still from Black.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Johan Voets/PR Company Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>They did find some allies, though. Their mentor at film school was Micha\u00ebl Roskam, director of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/jan/31/bullhead-review\">Oscar-nominated Bullhead</a> (which first brought <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/oct/28/matthias-schoenaerts-rust-bone-interview\">actor Matthias Schoenaerts to attention</a>). When they failed their first year (\u201cWe were making war movies, comedy shit, it didn\u2019t really work out,\u201d says Fallah), Roskam suggested they make movies more connected to their own backgrounds and identities. They won a prize with one of their first short films: funding to make another short. Instead, they used the money \u2013 \u20ac120,000 (\u00a3100,000) \u2013 to make a feature: Image, a thriller, again set in Molenbeek. It was a commercial success, though they describe it more as a \u201cpractice run\u201d.</p> <p>Another crucial ally was Hans Herbots, an established Belgian film-maker. He was the one who was already making Black, the movie. On the strength of Image, and their personal connection to the subject matter, Herbots generously suggested that they direct Black instead of him, El Arbi explains. \u201cAlso I think he was thinking: \u2018Fuck! A month in the hood in Molenbeek and me a white guy from Antwerp.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>When El Arbi and Fallah step into South Central a few days hence, they won\u2019t feel quite so intimidated. They can\u2019t believe how smoothly everything happens here in Hollywood, compared with Belgium. They had sleepless nights on Black wondering if enough extras would turn up the next day, says El Arbi. \u201cHere, it\u2019s like: \u2018You need 100 extras? All right. And they\u2019ll be there, in 1983 period clothing and hairstyles, period cars on the streets, the LAPD closing the roads. In Belgium, the cops give you authorisation to shoot and that\u2019s it. If there\u2019s a gang member coming to threaten you with a knife, which happened on the first day in Matonge, they will not be there.\u201d</p> <p>As with Black, though, the most important thing is the permission of the neighbourhoods where the real, often harrowing history they are recreating took place not so long ago. They have made efforts to include the communities where they are shooting, discussing and explaining the project, sometimes via \u201cgang liaison\u201d intermediaries. \u201cYou gotta have the streets on your side,\u201d says El Arbi. \u201cThese are their stories.\u201d</p> <p>The response has been broadly supportive, they say, even if locals don\u2019t always know what to make of them. \u201cThey\u2019re like, \u2018Where you from?\u2019\u201d says El Arbi. \u201cWe say Belgium and Morocco. They\u2019re like Morocco ... Africa!\u201d He holds out a silver pendant around his neck in the shape of Africa. They\u2019re honorary boyz in the hood. Perhaps they haven\u2019t come such a long way after all.</p> <p>El Arbi and Fallah haven\u2019t forgotten where they come from yet, they say. They are planning to make another movie there, after Snowfall and Beverly Hills Cop 4. But they also talk of shooting in Morocco, in Japan, of creating their own big-budget Hollywood science-fiction franchise. What were once dreams are now more like plans. And given their career trajectory so far, who is to say any of them are unrealistic?</p> <p><em>\u2022 </em><em>Black is released in UK cinemas and on VOD platforms</em><em> on 19 August</em></p>",
  "<p>Boiler Room\u2019s recent broadcast from Nigeria \u2013 which we\u2019re revisiting on Guardian Music today \u2013 broke new ground. It was the first time a show had been live-streamed from a Lagos nightclub to the world. With the club\u2019s own Wi-Fi connection offering a flickering, untrustworthy signal, the stream was facilitated by chaining multiple mobile sim cards together, giving enough bandwidth to upload a few hours of high-quality video. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--thumbnail\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/article-embeds/BoilerRoom/embed.html\" data-alt=\"Boiler Room\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/article-embeds/BoilerRoom/embed.html\">Boiler Room</a> </figure>  <p>That was apt. Where once it could take days, even months, for a song to travel from being a hit in Lagos to being a hit in Abuja (let alone to travel to being a hit in London or New York), the global spread of the current <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/jan/19/the-rise-of-afrobeats\">Afrobeats</a> scene has been helped in huge amount by two things: the increasing speed and availability of broadband in Lagos and the sudden proliferation of smartphone technology, which has brought computing power to the pockets of billions. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Giggs\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;position:relative; padding-bottom:calc(56.25% + 100px);&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot; https://boilerroom.tv/recording/giggs-lagos/?embedded=true&amp;minimal=false&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;position:absolute;top: 0px;left:0px;width:100%; height:100%;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> <figcaption>Giggs performs for Boiler Room in Nigeria </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cSocial media is the be all and end all out here,\u201d yells Teni Zaccheaus, over the noise at the <a href=\"https://boilerroom.tv/gateways-nigeria/\">Boiler Room</a> show. He\u2019s here as manager of DRB, a rising Afrobeats duo who are performing their mix of poppy R&amp;B, deep Nigerian melodies and bass-heavy hip-hop to the admiring home crowd. </p> <p>\u201cOver the last two years, data has become so much more accessible, even on people\u2019s not-so-smart phones. You can buy music, download music, it\u2019s made a big difference. Tweeting, Snapchat, SoundCloud, all of it \u2013 Nigerians are heavy users of the internet. It\u2019s insane how quickly songs can travel now.\u201d</p> <p>To make his point, he pulls out his phone and shows his WhatsApp account. It is constantly popping off with artists sending new music, promoters firing over party invites, and group chats dedicated to who is going where later that evening. \u201cIn Nigeria, WhatsApp is huge, the biggest form of communication. It\u2019s taken over from BlackBerry Messenger. Not everyone has iMessenger but everyone has WhatsApp \u2013 for business, for groups. I used a WhatsApp group to promote this show. Everyone\u2019s talking on it.\u201d </p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Mr Eazi performs for Boiler Room in Nigeria\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;position:relative; padding-bottom:calc(56.25% + 100px);&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://boilerroom.tv/recording/mr-eazi/?embedded=true&amp;minimal=false&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;position:absolute;top: 0px;left:0px;width:100%; height:100%;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> <figcaption>Mr Eazi performs for Boiler Room in Nigeria</figcaption> </figure> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/30/africa-a-day-in-the-digital-life\">A day in the digital life of Africa</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Artists are now creating groups to disseminate their brands, and using them to fire out emoji-spattered messages announcing new videos, exclusive downloads, clothing ranges and party invites, and almost completely ignoring traditional media in the process. Print media covering the new music scene is nearly nonexistent, and DJs on radio stations such as Beat FM \u2013 Lagos\u2019s current top station for breaking new homegrown talent \u2013 are as likely to hear a new track through a WhatsApp message or on a Snapchat loop as they are through any sort of standard promo campaign. </p> <p>In a country where mobile phones are far more affordable than laptops or tablets, it\u2019s inevitable that new social media, specifically platforms designed for phones, should take hold so quickly. While the story of artists taking control of their careers using social media has become well known in the UK, the speed with which Nigerians have adopted the technology \u2013 and the way this has networked the country\u2019s diaspora \u2013 is already having wider effects.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"500ee19ac7d5941b8bb75efdff946ae407201f05\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/500ee19ac7d5941b8bb75efdff946ae407201f05/0_0_2055_3000/685.jpg\" alt=\"Falz at the 2016 BET awards - where he won best new international act.\" width=\"685\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Falz at the 2016 BET awards \u2013 where he won best new international act.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Livingston/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p> Teni points out that Nigerian rapper Folarin Falana, otherwise known as Falz, has <a href=\"http://buzznigeria.com/falz-wins-bet-awards/\">just won the 2016 BET award for best new international act</a>. Falz is signed to his own independent label, Bahd Guys Records, and has almost no presence outside Nigeria (until he won the award, at least), and yet he beat, among others, the UK act Section Boyz, who have recently been performing with such American A-listers as Drake and Chris Brown. With the award being decided by a public vote, Falz was able to mobilise a huge Nigerian following via WhatsApp, communicating to the Nigerian diaspora as much as his local fans. It seems unlikely that Falz\u2019s award will be the last time that the influence of this network will be seen. </p> <p>Inevitably, as this increase in mobile technology disseminates Nigerian music to a worldwide audience, it also brings music into Nigeria from around the world \u2013 particularly the US and UK. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/may/12/skepta-konnichiwa-review-boy-better-know-album-of-the-week\">Skepta</a> is currently massive in Lagos, as his sellout Christmas show in the city proved, and the clubs are as likely to be playing the latest trap beats from Atlanta as they are anything produced in a local studio. As a result, the sound is hybridising, taking on elements of grime and trap and fusing them into Lagosian styles with a rapidity that had previously been absent. </p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen,\u201d concludes Teni. \u201cBut everybody is getting that outside view of what\u2019s going on in the rest of the world. It\u2019s changing the sound here. Everything\u2019s getting very exciting right now.\u201d</p>",
  "<h2>XIA, XIA GOT FLOORED</h2> <p>Generally speaking, when the owner of a club is on Twitter and actually engages with the great unwashed keyboard jabbers out there, only bad can come of it. They will almost inevitably get themselves involved with some sort of highly unedifying slanging match, will say something stupid or, even worse, actually listen to the opinions being belched incoherently at them. Still, sometimes it can provide amusement for the rest of us, and new Aston Villa owner Tony Xia could not have timed his foray on to the world wide web better.</p> <p>On Wednesday afternoon Xia took part in an official Twitter Q&amp;A, the sort of thing where usually only the most banal queries are answered in the most banal and uncontroversial manner possible, so as to give the impression of communicating with the people without actually saying anything of note. That\u2019s the plan, anyway. But in answer to the question \u201cwhere do you see Villa in five years\u2019 time?\u201d posed by an unwitting chap named Sam, Xia answered: \u201cThe top club in Europe with the highest number of fans all over the world.\u201d</p> <p>Cut to a few hours later, and his Villa side, featuring a number of players with years of top-flight experience (admittedly, experience of being no good there, but still), found themselves on the ugly end of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/10/league-cup-efl-burton-liverpool-luton-leeds-qpr\">a thorough 3-1 hosing by Luton</a> in the Milk Cup. Following up their opening weekend Championship defeat to Sheffield Wednesday, Villa found themselves flapping and floundering, their season having started with all the gusto and vim of an overcooked flan. Sitcom writers could not have crafted the whole thing better. Needless to say, Xia wasn\u2019t quite as chirpy after the game, locating the nearest moving bus and firmly chucking an indeterminate number of his underperforming players under it. \u201cEven we agreed to take the LC match as checking game, some players are not worth being given chance,\u201d he howled.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/10/league-cup-efl-burton-liverpool-luton-leeds-qpr\">EFL Cup roundup and draw: Aston Villa knocked out by League Two Luton</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Still, it\u2019s good to see manager Bobby Di Matteo has got a handle on things and has used his years of experience in the game to pinpoint exactly how they conceded three goals to a League Two side. \u201cWe will have to make sure we defend better,\u201d he sagely mused, possibly while swilling a glass of brandy, and sitting in a high-backed leather chair in front of a bookcase full of Football for Dummies tomes. \u201cWe do create chances at the other end but to win games you need to defend,\u201d he continued. Pick holes in that one if you can.</p> <p>In some respects it\u2019s quite nice that the owner of a club is setting high targets for his team. Aim for the stars, and even if you miss, at least you tried. Better to die on your feet than live on your knees and all that. And as these things usually come in threes, you can insert your own meaningless platitude about the benefits of positivity here. Ambition is good, trying is good, self-improvement is good. But perhaps you should maybe think twice about predicting your team, currently in the second tier and with Aly Cissokho remaining a first-choice player, will usurp Barcelona, Real Madrid and Bayern Munich within half a decade, particularly when your own manager doesn\u2019t exactly share your optimism. \u201cIt\u2019s a house that needs to be knocked down and started afresh,\u201d was Di Matteo\u2019s chipper assessment of the state of things when he arrived, a more realistic if a little gloomier prediction of what the immediate future holds at Villa Park. Xia seems to be asking his employees to knock down a two-bed semi and throw the Burj Khalifa up in its place, and be bloody quick about it too. So sure, be optimistic, aim high, be ambitious. Just try not to make yourself look like a complete clanker in the process.</p> <h2>QUOTE OF THE DAY</h2> <p>\u201cMost of you who are on my FB page are aware of the work that I do tackling racism and the work I do for Show Racism A Red Card.

While she made fun of Trump on the stump for <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/hillary-clinton-jokes-donald-trumps-economic-speech-written/story?id=41214000\">having</a> \u201ca dozen or so economic advisers he just named: hedge fund guys, billionaire guys, six guys named Steve, apparently,\u201d she is living in a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/20/hillary-clinton-goldman-sachs-vampire-squid-wall-street\">glass house funded by Goldman Sachs</a> and should be throwing no stones. We\u2019ll see whether she does in the big economic policy speech she is due to give on Thursday. <br></p> <p>They\u2019re not named Steve, but Clinton\u2019s been courting endorsements from billionaires Meg Whitman, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2015/12/16/warren-buffett-endorses-hillary-clinton-and-calls-for-higher-taxes-on-wealthy/?_r=0\">Warren Buffett</a> and Michael Bloomberg. Her own son-in-law is a <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/23/business/dealbook/for-clintons-a-hedge-fund-in-the-family.html\">\u201chedge fund guy\u201d,</a> and the Wall Street Journal <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/hedge-fund-money-48-5-million-for-hillary-clinton-19-000-for-donald-trump-1469784601\">reported</a> that \u201chedge fund money has vastly favored Clinton over Trump\u201d to the tidy sum of $122m. Being bothered by what this portends for our economic future this is not a vote for Trump.</p> <p>And though Trump hinting to his supporters that they might want to use the second amendment to possibly assassinate Clinton or justices of the supreme court is disgusting, let\u2019s not forget Clinton saying in May 2008 that she had to stay in that primary <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/24/us/politics/24clinton.html\">because</a> \u201cBobby Kennedy was assassinated in June in California\u201d and, ho hum, you never know what might happen to presumptive nominee Barack Obama.</p> <p>I bring this all up not to draw parallels between Clinton and Trump. She is clearly the more capable person suited to preside over this corrupt, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/09/baltimore-police-department-justice-department-investigation-findings\">perpetually and criminally violent</a> enterprise known as the United States of America. But let\u2019s not act like Clinton is a dove when it comes to matters of life and death.</p> <p>She has <a href=\"http://www.esquire.com/news-politics/politics/news/a47517/hillary-clinton-john-negroponte-endorsement/\">embraced</a> the endorsement of neocon John Negroponte and is even reportedly courting the endorsement of Henry Kissinger. As secretary of state, Clinton controversially supported not designating the 2009 ouster of Honduran president Manuel Zelaya as a <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2016/04/19/hillary-clintons-dodgy-answers-on-honduras-coup/?utm_term=.594728650351\">coup</a> , even though he was woken up by armed soldiers and <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/world/la-fg-clinton-honduras-coup-20160501-story.html\">forced</a> onto a plane and out of his country in his pajamas. She has since <a href=\"http://www.democracynow.org/2016/3/11/before_her_assassination_berta_caceres_singled\">defended</a> her role in that situation, which has led to hell for women, children and environmentalists, including the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/04/world/americas/berta-caceres-indigenous-activist-is-killed-in-honduras.html\">assassination</a> of indigenous activist Berta C\u00e1ceres. And as senator, Clinton <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/apr/11/bernie-sanders-hillary-clinton-iraq-war-vote-presidential-campaign\">supported</a> the Iraq war, a vote which helped lead to the death of US army captain Humayun Khan.</p> <p>Captain Khan\u2019s parents have valiantly and admirably taken on Trump and his ugly Islamophobia. But turning a critical lens on the presidential candidate who supported the war that killed their son does not equate supporting her opponent.</p> <p>So if you\u2019re in what can broadly called the left, you a few have choices how to spend the next three months. You can scream \u201cYaaaaaaas, I\u2019m with her!\u201d and do your part to elect Clinton without thought or critique. That\u2019s fine if her positions on war and economics don\u2019t bother you, and there is value in shutting down Trump\u2019s malarkey as quickly as possible.</p> <p>But there is something perhaps more valuable in withholding your support and not giving it away too early, if at all. As James Thindwa <a href=\"http://inthesetimes.com/article/19361/the-black-establishments-blank-check-for-hillary\">wrote</a> of the Congressional Black Caucus, the \u201crush by black leadership to endorse Clinton was an unforced strategic blunder\u201d. Instead of \u201crobustly challenging both Clinton and Sanders on racial justice issues [during the primaries] \u2013 as Black Lives Matter activists did,\u201d the CBC \u201ccould have sent a strong message to a party that takes black Americans\u2019 support for granted, fails to deliver real solutions and too often patronizes them\u201d.</p> <p>The CBC would likely have gotten far better economic policies backing Sanders; and, as Trump\u2019s implosion has made clear, Sanders would have been a contender. Instead, the CBC backed Clinton too soon and now has to take whatever crumbs it gets from the Clinton trough as she wields America\u2019s racist id incarnate like a cudgel as the only alternative. (And the CBC will get pushed away as Clinton welcomes Wall Street, warmongers and wealthy Republicans to pay for a place at that trough.)</p> <p>You can critique Clinton and vote for a third party for any reason. American sovereignty lies in the individual, and our votes are never owed to anybody. However, Trump is shaping up as the Republican Walter Mondale, and could lose badly. At the same time, Clinton will still have very safe margins in large states that are not battlegrounds like New York and California. This means 2016 will be an especially safe year to vote dissent, because millions of people unhappy with Clinton in safely blue (or even safely red) states can vote for a third party without increasing Trump\u2019s odds. </p> <p>Finally, you can critique Clinton ... and still vote for Clinton. This is possible! I love my friends and family (and, on a good day, myself), but I am still very critical of all of us. Criticism doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t love us. Furthermore, politicians are not even our friends. As citizens, we should keep politicians working for our interests and our respect by critiquing them with a level of scrutiny the power we are entrusting them with demands.</p>",
  "<p>To the set of the latest Fast &amp; Furious, the multibillion-dollar movie franchise that any psychiatrist will tell you makes Clarkson-era Top Gear look relaxed about the size of its penis. If you have ever wondered <a href=\"http://www.cinemablend.com/new/10-Best-Fast-Furious-Car-Stunts-Ranked-By-Greatness-70667.html?story_page=9\">what it\u2019s like to jump from one Dubai skyscraper to another in a car</a> \u2013 and more importantly, what it means about your relationship with your mother \u2013 this is the hot metal cinematic experience for you. And, yes, obviously I\u2019ve watched them all.</p> <p>But that\u2019s not important right now, because there is beef on the set of its newest iteration, Fast 8. Chances are your response to that is: \u201cUm, yes? The movie stars Vin Diesel, The Rock, Jason Statham, Ludacris, Scott Eastwood \u2026 Self-evidently there is beef. It is a beef farm. Or rather, a mechanically recovered beef processing plant, where you would probably rather not partake of the wares on offer.\u201d</p> <p>Yet wait \u2013 because I\u2019m not talking about that kind of beef. This is the other beef: aggro beef, conflict beef, the kind of beef where franchise star <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BI25NjMDPWv/\">The Rock posts a late-night, lengthy social media rant</a> this week, and it isn\u2019t just a stream of tenuously coherent hashtags like #30repsaminute #projectburn #justbringit #bloodsweat&amp;respect #crushthefear #betterneverstops #bringonthegreat. (Actually, the last two are the most recent official slogans for Team GB \u2013 I believe they use The Rock\u2019s discarded workout tweets as their official branding agency.)</p> <p>And so to The Rock\u2019s 95 Theses. Beneath a short clip of him throwing some chap against a wall, he began by saluting the movie\u2019s crew and \u201cmy female co-stars\u201d. \u201cMy male co-stars however are a different story,\u201d he went on. \u201cSome conduct themselves as stand up men and true professionals, while others don\u2019t. The ones that don\u2019t are too chicken shit to do anything about it anyway. Candy asses.\u201d</p> <p>Oof. As Bismarck once pointed out, those who like sausages and enjoy the Fast &amp; Furious franchise should never see either being made. But there was more, including an insight into The Rock\u2019s process for which Inside the Actors Studio would kill. \u201cWhen you watch this movie next April,\u201d The Rock revealed, \u201cand it seems like I\u2019m not acting in some of these scenes and my blood is legit boiling \u2013 you\u2019re right.\u201d Clearly, cinematic historians will come to view this post as the Hearts of Darkness to Fast 8\u2019s Apocalypse Now. In the meantime, I hope The Rock takes a crumb of comfort from the fact that he is in a line of work where he is able to channel his raging desire to throw people into a wall into the role of a raging man who throws people into a wall.</p> <p>More pressingly, though, what of said co-workers? If anything, the international media have underplayed the outburst, reporting simply that it \u201csent shockwaves round the world\u201d, and declaring that The Rock\u2019s fellow Fast 8 stars were furious that \u201cthey are all suspects\u201d. Quite. There were still several days of filming left. They didn\u2019t know whether it was their ass being watched for signs of candy. I can\u2019t even imagine the strain of living in that type of paranoia-inducing closed environment, let alone shooting a scene where a car has to headbutt a Chinook, and you daren\u2019t even ask what your motivation for screaming NOOOOOOOOOO is, in case you\u2019re being scoped. That set can have been nothing less than the panopticon of candyassery.</p> <p>Consequently, some of The Rock\u2019s co-stars broke early and in ways that were painful to watch. Tyrese Gibson was so anxious not to be identified as the candy ass that he posted a film of The Rock singing to his young daughter <a href=\"https://uk.movies.yahoo.com/fast-8-tyrese-gibson-has-never-had-a-problem-210401130.html\">accompanied by the observation:</a> \u201cA man wouldn\u2019t be singing with his heart and soul to another man\u2019s little angel if he had a problem with her dad.\u201d I literally can\u2019t think of a more candy-assed reaction. But Tyrese didn\u2019t seem to be the candy ass in question.</p> <p>After a couple of days of fevered speculation, reports finally zeroed in on the candy ass in question \u2013 and, would you believe, it is said to be none other than Vin Diesel himself.</p> <p>Clearly, this is a lot to take in. This, after all, is Vin Diesel \u2013 real name Mark Sinclair \u2013 who, from the get-go, selected the pretend surname Diesel over something flashy like Vin Petrol or Vin Gasoline. That sent a humble message. It suggested he was hard-working, might retain his value better over time, but mainly represented a sensible, cheaper choice for the economically minded auteur. And I\u2019d like to think Vin\u2019s canon has borne that out.</p> <p>But now \u2013 well, has there been a higher-camp movie feud in years? On screen, these tattooed hardmen may square up tit-to-tit, a stack-heeled Diesel in the honorary Bruce Willis vest that hasn\u2019t been washed since Die Hard, and The Rock in some sort of wired-up gilet that says: \u201cI\u2019m a law-enforcement operative who understands that sometimes rules have to be broken.\u201d (Incidentally, given the height difference between the two, I\u2019m not sure how the eye-to-eye contact is achieved. In Hollywood days of yore, some short actors used to stand on steps to tower over their female co-stars, but Alan Ladd made the Boy on a Dolphin crew dig a hole for Sophia Loren to stand in. Is Vin on a box or is The Rock in a hole? I\u2019d appreciate someone from the set getting in touch to clarify.) Anyway, off-screen the story is surely different. The pair are \u2013 how to put this kindly? \u2013 actors. The powerful suspicion must be that were Vin and The Rock to have a real-life fight in a pub car park, it would just be two men screaming: \u201cNot the face! NOT THE FACE!\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/lostinshowbiz/2015/aug/20/the-rock-is-taking-a-money-spinning-disney-ride-dwayne-johnson\">All aboard! The Rock is taking a money-spinning Disney ride</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As for where we are now \u2026 The Rock has since posted a wrap message in which he explains: \u201cLike with any team \u2013 that\u2019s a family \u2013 there\u2019s gonna be conflict. Family is gonna have differences of opinion and fundamental core beliefs \u2026 And like any family, we get better from it. At the end of the day me and #F8 co-stars all agree on the most important thing: Delivering an incredible movie to the world.\u201d A moving reminder that, ultimately, it is about the art we leave behind.</p> <p>Still, it\u2019s not at all clear whether there has been some kind of formal F8 peace process \u2013 perhaps UN ass inspectors were given access to the set to confirm that no viable candy existed. Perhaps some kind of candy-ass decommissioning process took place, supervised by a retired Canadian general. All we know is that Vin Diesel took instant leave of the set after he wrapped with a valedictory address to the movie\u2019s cast and crew, in which he announced: \u201cDaddy\u2019s gone.\u201d</p> <p>Mmm. As indicated from the start, it is an ongoing scandal that Sigmund Freud isn\u2019t given a pre-title credit in this thing. I believe he was still listed as \u201cAssistant to Mr Diesel\u201d in Fast &amp; Furious 7, but in light of this developing story his estate MUST insist that changes for 8.</p>",
  "<p>Rio 2016 organisers said they would urgently look into a claim by a prominent International Olympic Committee member that an ambulance destined for the injured New Zealand sevens player Sonny Bill Williams got lost for an hour and a half.</p> <p>John Coates, the Australian IOC vice-president who first raised concerns over Brazil\u2019s readiness for the Games in 2014, said Rio 2016 was the \u201cmost difficult\u201d ever organised amid ongoing concern over empty seats in venues, stray bullets and logistical challenges.</p> <p>Williams sustained a ruptured achilles tendon during the second half of New Zealand\u2019s 14-12 defeat against Japan on Tuesday, but after being removed from the field had to wait for an ambulance, according to Coates.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s still difficult,\u2019\u2019 Coates told the Daily Telegraph in Australia. \u201cEvery morning we have a meeting with the IOC president and vice-presidents and each of the federations and Olympic committees and we also meet with the organising committee.</p> <p>\u201cBut transport, there\u2019s still incidents.

Luckily it was an achillies and not concussion.\u2019\u2019</p> <p>Coates said it had been a testing Olympics. \u201cIt\u2019s been very difficult, the most difficult Games we have ever encountered in terms of political and economic background,\u201d he told the BBC. \u201cSeven years ago when Rio were selected they were on the verge of being a top five GDP [gross domestic product] nation in the world. They\u2019re 74th now and it\u2019s been a struggle.\u201d</p> <p>In 2014, Coates caused controversy when he said preparations for Rio were behind schedule and the \u201cworst ever\u201d.

A review of the availability of first aid kits is being carried out. Military have changed their plans and increased their presence in the area,\u201d the spokesman said.</p> <p>\u201cEveryone on the scene has confirmed again and again that it was a stone, thrown by a teenager or a kid. Every single bus is now escorted by a military vehicle. A report is being made available. Security is our main concern and our main mission.

The athletes and the horses are safe and the military has adopted new plans as a result of these new incidents,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to keep people safe and we have every reason to believe the efforts of the army will be successful.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2016/aug/11/rio-olympics-2016-day-six-swimming-rowing-cycling-rugby-sevens-live\">Rio Olympics 2016: Poland pip British pair to rowing gold in thriller \u2013 live!</a> </p> </aside>",
  "<p>A <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/09/baltimore-police-department-justice-department-investigation-findings\">scathing report released</a> on Wednesday by the US Department of Justice found that Baltimore police officers regularly engage in unlawful, egregious conduct.</p> <p>The primary findings of the report focused on widespread racial bias in the patterns or practices of Baltimore police department, but there\u2019s another strain of allegations: gender-based bias and mistreatment.</p> <p>The justice department documented numerous instances in its report of hostility toward alleged sexual assault victims, callous treatment of female suspects, public strip-searches and even allegations of sex in exchange for immunity. </p> <p>\u201cThey treat us differently, they call us bitches, whores, prostitutes, tricks,\u201d one of the women who gave testimony to the DoJ but wished to remain anonymous for fear of retaliation said of treatment by police.</p> <p>The DoJ, however, did not deem its findings widespread enough to find that the police department as a whole engaged in \u201cgender-biased policing in violation of federal law\u201d.</p> <p>The DoJ cites a disturbing email between a police officer and a prosecutor \u201cin which they openly expressed their contempt for and disbelief of a woman who had reported a sexual assault: the prosecutor wrote that \u2018this case is crazy \u2026 I am not excited about charging it. This victim seems like a conniving little whore. (pardon my language).\u2019; the BPD officer replied, \u201cLmao! I feel the same.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cUnfortunately, we were not made aware of these assertions and we do not know the author of this email,\u201d a spokesperson for the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s office said. \u201cIf we did, we would take appropriate action for such insensitivity. We denounce any survivor of sexual assault being referred to as a \u2018whore\u2019 or any other derogatory term.\u201d</p> <p>The report also notes that \u201cin their interviews of women reporting sexual assault, for example, BPD detectives ask questions such as \u2018Why are you messing this guy\u2019s life up?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe were also troubled by statements of BPD detectives suggesting an undue skepticism of reports of sexual assault,\u201d the report reads, citing a statement made by a detective to police officers and victim advocates at a party. \u201cIn homicide, there are real victims; all our cases are bullshit.\u201d</p> <p>According to the report, \u201cgender bias may be affecting BPD\u2019s handling of sexual assault cases\u201d. Investigators found that \u201cBPD seriously and systematically under-investigates reports of sexual assault, and the sexual assault investigations it does conduct are marked by practices that significantly compromise the effectiveness and impartiality of its response to sexual assault.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"66d270147d22493f6e96017c31a53b5ed34f0ffd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/66d270147d22493f6e96017c31a53b5ed34f0ffd/0_183_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Baltimore\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Baltimore police commissioner Kevin Davis and Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake during a press conference on the justice department report.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Win McNamee/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The report refers to a 2010 Baltimore Sun investigation that showed the department was dismissing rape complaints at five times the national average. The report notes that, though the number of cases considered \u201cunfounded\u201d have fallen, many more remain \u201copen\u201d, often indefinitely. This \u201cfailure to remedy its procedures for collecting and reviewing data about sexual assault\u201d results in practices \u201cincluding interrogating rape victims, questioning women in the emergency room, threatening to hook up women reporting sexual assault to lie detectors, and not informing victims about the status of their cases\u201d, the report said.</p> <p>\u201cBPD\u2019s response to reports of sexual assault is, overall, grossly inadequate,\u201d the report reads. </p> <p>In some cases cited by the DoJ, the assault itself was performed by an officer. According to the report, one woman informed BPD investigators that she met with a certain officer and engaged in sexual activities in the officer\u2019s patrol car once every other week \u201cin exchange for US currency or immunity from arrest\u201d.</p> <p>The DoJ called the activity \u201ccriminal\u201d and \u201can abuse of power\u201d, but the department administratively closed the case without interviewing either the officer or witnesses. Then a \u201cCrime Stoppers\u201d tip reported that the same officer was \u201chaving sex in a patrol vehicle\u201d with a woman involved in the sex trade and was eventually allowed to resign, without ever facing charges, when a neighboring police department made even more allegations against him and his phone records revealed sexually explicit text messages with \u201cother women who numbers were linked to online profiles for sex trade services\u201d.</p> <p>The report mentions that gender bias is particularly strong against women with particular vulnerabilities, including those in the sex trade. The report does not elaborate on treatment of sex workers, but in hours of taped interviews with current or former sex workers submitted to the DoJ, women told similar stories of sexual coercion and alleged that officers discarded their complaints altogether. These women made the reports anonymously and the identities of the officers allegedly involved could not be confirmed.</p> <p>\u201cThey don\u2019t do their job it\u2019s like we\u2019re just trash, like something to be thrown away like whatever happens to us happens to us and they join in with the noise,\u201d said one African American woman not identified in the tapes, obtained by the Guardian. \u201cAnd that\u2019s how you\u2019re made to feel like the only way you\u2019re going to survive out there in the streets with the police is you just got to do what they want you to do or take the abuse and the neglect they give you to keep you from being locked up.\u201d</p> <p> Several of these people said they did not make formal complaints to the city, because they did not want to give their name, although they felt safer providing information to the DoJ.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s hard for the women to speak out because they fear retaliation,\u201d said Jacqueline Robarge, of Power Inside, who conducted the recorded interviews and provided them to the DoJ. </p> <p>Robarge said the sex workers she deals with face both sex and race discrimination, exacerbating their experience with police. </p> <p>\u201cIf we put all of that together it\u2019s not about sex work or rape reporting but how black women are treated when they have one social stigma standing in the way of proper treatment by police,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Kalima Young, a lecturer at Towson University who researches race and gender-based trauma, said the report errs in not looking at gender and race together.</p> <p>\u201cThere seems to be a desire to put blinders on,\u201d she said. \u201cThe way the report says they are disproportionately targeting African Americans acts as if by default those African Americans are black males and not black women and not trans women not LBT folks.\u201d</p> <p>The report found that many of the civil rights violations against African Americans stemmed from the \u201czero tolerance\u201d policies of the late 1990s and early 2000s, where officers were rewarded for \u201cclearing corners.\u201d African American women are even more vulnerable to charges like loitering, trespassing, and disorderly conduct, Robarge said.</p> <p>\u201cFor a woman to be at a bus stop in an area that may have some sort of prostitution or drug addiction just being at that bus stop makes you suspect. So they will come and accuse women of loitering...and they could get charged with prostitution from there. It\u2019s an additional way that women can be criminalized,\u201d she said. </p> <p>\u201cIf you look at the conversation [in the report] on transgendered women, just walking down the street as a transgendered woman means you can be stopped for any reason.\u201d</p> <p>The report also found that transgender individuals deal with bias that is \u201cdegrading and dehumanizing\u201d which makes them \u201cafraid to report crime to law enforcement\u201d.</p> <p>One trans woman cited in the report told an officer that she identified as female and yet was repeatedly referred to as \u201cthat\u201d by officers.</p> <p>According to the DoJ, numerous residents, regardless of sex, gender, or age, complained of BPD officers \u201cjumping out\u201d of police vehicles and strip-searching individuals on public streets.</p> <p>In one instance where a formal complaint to the department was sustained \u201cofficers in BPD\u2019s Eastern District publicly strip-searched a woman following a routine traffic stop for a missing headlight.

Her treatment violates principles of intellectual freedom, justice and fairness that are central to the Islamic system of morality.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>As a Muslim thinker and a guardian of the faith, I must plead for the swift release of this respected scholar</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Born in Iran and now a Canadian and Irish citizen, Hoodfar is a senior anthropologist who has devoted her academic career to studying the family as well as the duties and rights of women in various Muslim contexts. A renowned scholar, she has taught at Concordia University in Montreal for the past three decades. Her research on Muslim women\u2019s struggles \u2013 both in the Middle East and in the west \u2013 is balanced and characterised by respect for those about whom she writes.</p> <p>Her extensive work on Muslim women living in the west and their veiling strategies has been a particularly important contribution to challenging colonial images of the Muslim veil, while at the same time helping to address Islamophobia in the west. Since she is neither a political activist nor part of any political movement opposing the government of Iran, she never hesitated to visit the Islamic republic to see family or conduct historical research.</p> <p>While Tehran\u2019s prosecutor <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/iran-indicts-dual-nationals-including-a-us-businessman-but-wont-say-for-what/2016/07/11/ad6b0b96-4775-11e6-90a8-fb84201e0645_story.html\" title=\"\">recently announced indictments</a> against Hoodfar \u2013 along with several other dual nationals \u2013 the charges she faces remain unknown.

Her research poses no threat to Iran\u2019s government or its people, and her arrest is deeply disturbing for anyone who values academic freedom and independent scholarship.</p> <p>What is more, Hoodfar\u2019s treatment contradicts Islamic legal principles. In an Islamic system of criminal justice, the accused are innocent until proved guilty, and are entitled to certain rights including access to counsel and an adequate defence, freedom from torture or inhumane treatment, and a fair and speedy trial. Iranian law also recognises these principles, yet despite the fact that no court has found her guilty, Hoodfar is being treated like a criminal and denied her basic, God-given rights.</p> <p>In a country like Iran \u2013 one founded upon Islamic principles \u2013 I expect core Islamic teachings such as justice and truthfulness to be observed in the treatment of citizens. Indeed, we read in the Qur\u2019an: \u201cGod commands justice and fair dealing \u2026\u201d (Qur\u2019an 16:90); while in another verse we read: \u201cO you who believe! Have fear of God, and be among the truthful\u201d (Qur\u2019an 9:119). Since an Islamic government that sins against the Quranic ethos undermines the faith of the believing community and harms the reputation of Islam, I find myself obliged \u2013 as a Muslim thinker and a guardian of the faith \u2013 to plead for the swift release of this respected scholar. The academic community are united in their outrage over her arrest and are <a href=\"http://www.homahoodfar.org/\" title=\"\">asking for her to be released immediately</a>. I add my voice to theirs, and plead for the Islamic Republic of Iran to free Homa Hoodfar.</p>",

  "<p>The Drug Enforcement Agency will not remove marijuana from the Schedule I drugs list, its head Chuck Rosenberg has announced, despite a bipartisan group of state legislators calling for it.</p> <p>Rosenberg\u2019s decision was relied heavily on <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2016/08/10/489509471/dea-rejects-attempt-to-loosen-federal-restrictions-on-marijuana\">a report</a> by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) that marijuana has \u201cno currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States\u201d and is subject to abuse \u2013 the standard for<strong> </strong><a href=\"https://www.dea.gov/druginfo/ds.shtml\">Schedule I drugs</a> as defined by the <a href=\"http://www.fda.gov/regulatoryinformation/legislation/ucm148726.htm\">US Controlled Substances Act</a></p> <p>The move came with <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/11/science/obama-administration-set-to-remove-barrier-to-marijuana-research.html?_r=1\">one caveat</a>: the DEA will allow universities to apply to grow marijuana for research purposes. Currently, only the University of Mississippi is licensed to do so, which scientists say limits their ability to research the medical uses of marijuana. The FDA and DEA claimed that the lack of scientific data on medical marijuana motivated their decision not to change marijuana\u2019s Schedule I classification.</p> <p>\u201cIf our understanding of the science changes,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/politics-government/white-house/article94998397.html\">said Rosenberg</a>, \u201cthat could very well drive a new decision.\u201d</p> <p>Dr Igor Grant, the director of the Center for Medicinal Cannabis Research at the University of California San Diego School of Medicine \u2013 one of the main recipients of federal funds for cannabis research \u2013 hailed the loosening of one restriction on research. \u201cActions that reduce obstacles to conducting serious, rigorous science regarding the use of cannabis to treat diseases is a good thing,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is significant evidence that cannabis possesses therapeutic value, and it is worthy of continued, even accelerated, investigation and development.\u201d</p> <p>But marijuana advocates say that the federal government is simply ignoring the results of scientific research performed despite the current limits on growing marijuana for the purpose of studying its medical uses.</p> <p>\u201cPresident Obama always said he would let science \u2013 and not ideology \u2013 dictate policy,\u201d Tom Angell, the chairman on Marijuana Majority, said in a statement. \u201cBut in this case, his administration is upholding a failed drug war approach instead of looking at real, existing evidence that marijuana has medical value.\u201d</p> <p>Paul Armentano, the deputy director of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws (Norml), agreed. \u201cWhile this announcement is a significant step toward better facilitating and expanding clinical investigations into cannabis\u2019 therapeutic efficacy,\u201d he said, \u201c<a href=\"http://norml.org/library/recent-research-on-medical-marijuana\">ample scientific evidence already exists</a> to remove cannabis from its Schedule I classification and to acknowledge its relative safety compared to other scheduled substances, like opioids, and unscheduled substances, such as alcohol.\u201d</p> <p>Both men called for congressional action to change the federal regulation of cannabis in a way that would allow states to regulate marijuana as they see fit.</p> <p>The ability of states to legalize marijuana \u2013 for medical or recreational use \u2013 without interference from the federal government is a key issue in many states. Federal law has <a href=\"http://reason.com/blog/2011/06/30/white-house-overrides-2009-mem\">infamously</a> been used to prosecute marijuana growers and dispensaries in states that legalized cannabis, despite <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/blog/memorandum-selected-united-state-attorneys-investigations-and-prosecutions-states\">a 2009 memo</a> from the Obama justice department suggesting that targeting medical marijuana users and suppliers should be a low priority for law enforcement. (The guidance was <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/oip/legacy/2014/07/23/dag-guidance-2011-for-medical-marijuana-use.pdf\">\u201cclarified\u201d in 2011</a> to suggest that significant marijuana businesses even in states where it was legal were not exempt from criminal scrutiny.) In 2013, the justice department <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/obama-administration-will-not-preempt-state-marijuana-laws--for-now/2013/08/29/b725bfd8-10bd-11e3-8cdd-bcdc09410972_story.html\">announced</a> it would not seek to override recreational use laws in Washington and Colorado by prosecuting all producers and sellers, as long as laws were put into place to prevent the movement of marijuana across state lines and keep it out of the hands of children.</p> <p>But as long as marijuana remains classified as a Schedule I drug, this guidance can be overturned. And because federal banking laws prohibit financial services companies from doing business with companies engaged in illegal activity \u2013 which the sale of marijuana still is at the federal level \u2013 nothing short of a reclassification can provide more safety and stability for marijuana-related businesses in the long term.</p> <p>That was the thinking behind the <a href=\"http://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/politics-government/white-house/article94998397.html\"> 2011 petition</a> by Washington state governor Christine Gregoire and then Rhode Island governor Lincoln Chafee, which the DEA announced on Wednesday that it would deny. And, just hours before that<strong> </strong>announcement, the National Conference of State Legislatures (NCLS) adopted a resolution that means the organization will, under its bylaws, \u201clobby the Congress, the White House and federal agencies\u201d to change marijuana\u2019s designation under the law. Schedule I is the strictest designation under the federal law. Among those drugs listed in the less restrictive Schedule II are methamphetamine and opium.</p> <p>Oregon state representative Ann Lininger, who introduced the resolution, explained that, since 25 states plus the District of Columbia and Guam have legalized marijuana under some circumstances \u2013 be it for medical or recreational use \u2013 the continuing classification of marijuana as a Schedule I substance creates both risks for businesses in states that have deemed it legal and difficulties for states seeking to regulate a growing industry.</p> <p>\u201cThere are 5,000 legal cannabis businesses in the United States\u201d said Lininger, a Democrat. \u201cAnd they don\u2019t have reliable access to banking services.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt creates a public safety risk,\u201d she said, because the classification of marijuana means that banks and other federally regulated financial services companies cannot do business with dispensaries. That, in turn, necessitates that all marijuana businesses operate strictly in cash, which often leads to robberies and muggings. Besides, which, she said, \u201cthere\u2019s an inability to track sales for oversight and regulation,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd it probably affects tax compliance.\u201d</p> <p>The resolution notes that \u201cthe federal Bank Secrecy Act and its implementing regulations impose substantial administrative and operational burdens, compliance risk and regulatory risk that serve as a barrier\u201d to financial services companies wishing to do business with legal marijuana companies, and that the <a href=\"https://www.fincen.gov/statutes_regs/guidance/pdf/FIN-2014-G001.pdf\">2014 \u201cclarification\u201d memo</a> issued by the Department of Treasury\u2019s financial crimes enforcement network \u201cis inadequate to create a regulatory environment as it does not change applicable federal laws, imposes significant compliance burdens and is subject to change at any time\u201d \u2013 including with a new administration in the White House.</p> <p>\u201cStates should have to ability to chart their own way forward on cannabis regulation, outside of federal oversight,\u201d Lininger said, calling it a states\u2019 rights issue that had led many legislators of a more conservative bent on marijuana policy to support the resolution. </p> <p>The National Conference of State Legislatures, which is made up of member state legislatures and legislator participants, serves as both a research and advocacy organization for the interests of state legislatures, as determined by a bipartisan plurality of participants. The resolution process determines the organization\u2019s priorities in <a href=\"http://www.ncsl.org/aboutus.aspx\">its efforts </a>\u201cto fight unwarranted federal preemption of state laws, unfunded mandates and federal legislation that threatens state authority and autonomy\u201d.</p>",

The work is part of the Walk Again Project that unites 100 scientists from 25 countries.</p> <p>The study parallels other approaches to spinal cord injury: there are hopes of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/video/2012/nov/20/paralysed-dog-nose-cells-video\">stem cell therapy</a> that could make possible natural repairs to the nervous system, and of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/apr/13/brain-implant-paralysed-man-regain-partial-control-hand-neural-bypass\">electronic implants</a> that might bypass a spinal cord injury to transmit the brain\u2019s message to the muscles. </p> <p>The Brazilian trial was originally intended as a test of the third approach: robotic aids driven by brainpower. The scientists gave an example of what they thought possible in 2014 when Juan Pinto, a 25-year-old paraplegic, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/apr/01/mind-controlled-robotic-suit-exoskeleton-world-cup-2014\">used a brain-controlled robotic exoskeleton to kick a football</a> during the opening ceremony of the World Cup in Sao Paulo. </p> <p>The exoskeleton technology existed.

They fitted patients with electrodes that could register electroencephalogram signals from the brain. Then they asked the patients to \u201cthink\u201d about moving their legs. None of them could do so: the motor cortex of the brain has a pronounced apparatus for representing movement, and the patients could \u201cthink\u201d hand movements, but the leg connection had been wiped clean. </p> <p>None of the patients in the experiment had benefited from any traditional rehabilitation before they joined the project. And none of the eight could control any movement below the level of the spinal cord injury.</p> <p>The next stage was to introduce VR, and off-the-shelf walking devices now used in physical therapy centres for the injured, as well as overhead harnesses to get the patients accustomed to making a link between movement and thinking about movement. The experimenters fed back the sensation of walking to a pressure pad on the patient\u2019s forearm, and used a VR avatar, to help give the patient the illusion of walking, and then the distinctive sensations of walking over grass or sand. </p> <p> </p> <p>Gradually, and at different rates, they began to experience voluntary muscle function below the injury. They went from a total absence of touch sensation to the capacity to sense pain, pressure and vibration, though not temperature. Gastrointestinal function improved, and those who spent most time upright and walking saw the most improvement in bowel control. Men reported experiencing erections. All had been diagnosed as cases of complete paralysis. Since the training, some of them have now been reclassified as partially paralysed.</p> <p> None yet can walk unaided, but one has progressed to walking \u2013 without any help from a therapist \u2013 with crutches and braces from hip to ankle to support the legs. The research paper describes results after the first 10 months of the study. But the training continues, and there is more yet to be published.</p> <p>\u201cWe are already thinking about ways of disseminating this protocol with more affordable technology,\u201d Nicolelis said. </p> <p>\u201cIf you remember your first cellphone, it looked like a brick, and now I am talking to you from a tiny little cellphone in Brazil, so things have evolved very quickly. I think that at the moment we can show clinical benefits. There are about 25 million people in the world paralysed just with spinal cord injuries and when you receive a diagnosis of being a complete paraplegic people usually don\u2019t do anything any more to you. They just try to get you adapted to life in a wheelchair.\u201d</p>",

But Tom, an engineer in London, thinks the only way for the franchise system to work is to have genuine competition on every route.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We need to ensure there is a choice of operators on every route. Market forces will only work if there is a choice of which operator to travel with.</p> <p>With transport the customer cannot choose their destination, so has to buy a ticket from just one company. The current franchise system just creates insta-monopolies as far as the customer is concerned. Customers should be able to choose which company to travel with. <br></p> <p>It should be the government\u2019s job to run what cannot be a competitive service (Network Rail), and the Franchise\u2019s job to compete to provide the best service on that service.</p> <p>For example, Deutsche Bahn should compete with Virgin for customers on the West Coast Mainline. Or, if Southern decides to cancel 300 trains, then Virgin should be free to pick up the slack. <br></p> </blockquote> <p>Mark Wilson, who lives in Streatham in south London, and thus within Southern\u2019s area, makes a similar point about competition.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Privatisation works when there is competition. Energy suppliers, TV broadcasters, airlines, banks, etc, may not be perfect but when customers are able to switch providers, there is at least a disincentive to improve or provide a satisfactory service.<br></p> <p>With passenger rail, there is no competition; if I want to travel from Streatham Common to Clapham Junction there is one rail line. My alternatives are other modes of transport (bus, bike, taxi) - that means there is no competition and no option for passengers to choose another provider if they are dissatisfied. It would be impossible to add multiple millions of miles of extra track to create this necessary competition.</p> <p>Therefore, any service where there is a monopoly not by design but by physical limitations should be run by the Government or a publicly-owned body to protect the consumers\u2019 rights. Whether this is renationalisation or mutualisation is by-the-by; we just want to get the service we are paying for.<br></p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-08-11T12:55:32.489Z\">at 1.55pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57ac7260e4b0f231200d9e57\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/james-walsh\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-11T12:42:05.880Z\">1.42pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>And here\u2019s an interesting comment on the byzantine foreign ownership behind many of Britain\u2019s train operating companies.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-comment\" data-canonical-url=\"https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/80974999\">  <div class=\"d2-comment-embedded\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Comment\"> <div class=\"d2-left-col\"> <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/4752510\" title=\"View jezheywood\u2019s profile\"> <img class=\"d2-avatar\" src=\"https://avatar.guim.co.uk/user/4752510\" height=\"40\" width=\"40\" alt=\"User avatar for jezheywood\"> </a> </div> <div class=\"d2-right-col\"> <div itemscope itemprop=\"author\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"> <a class=\"d2-username\" href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/4752510\" title=\"View jezheywood\u2019s profile\" itemprop=\"url\"> <span itemprop=\"givenName\">jezheywood</span> </a> </div> <div class=\"d2-permalink\"> <a class=\"d2-datetime\" href=\"https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/80974999\" title=\"Link to this comment\" itemprop=\"datePublished\">11 August 2016 1:01pm</a> </div> <div class=\"d2-body\" itemprop=\"text\"><p>The railways are nationalised, in a way.

Even during strikes it was better than the UK service.</p> <p>It's subsidised, my UK friends said, so I looked into it. Yes it was, but if the subsidy was removed ticket prices would still be half those of the UK. I looked some more. </p> <p>1. It's publicly owned. More than that it is a proud public service trying to improve How it serves the public every day. </p> <p>2. It's integrated. Timetables, buses, trams, metros and trains all work together to ensure fast connections and smooth journeys.</p> <p>3. It improves constantly. Every year in Paris, bus routes were tweaked, say to go to a new hospital, and new lines/stations/escalators were added.</p> <p>4. There is a plan. In fact for the Paris region there is a 20+ year improvement plan that keeps being updated. It's public so you can comment and ask for tweaks.</p> <p>5. But most importantly, in France, doing things for the public is understood to be a good thing, to be done as efficiently as possible, for the lowest possible price, with all government skills to be brought to bear on it. No, it's not always perfect, but they are at least trying.<br /> <br />In the UK, it feels as though this &quot;public' service has been sold to the rentier classes to extract as much money as possible from the travelling public for the absolute minimum effort. There is no shame when things go wrong, with everyone else being blamed but the company operating it. </p> <p>I am left wondering what the British government thinks it is there for, if not to ensure that the country's infrastructure actually works and British citizens have a decent standard of living?</p></div> </div> </div>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9d8c125a716394be06aa7f642c8266917bbeb3c6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9d8c125a716394be06aa7f642c8266917bbeb3c6/0_0_4256_2554/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Paris Metro.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Paris Metro.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Martin Bureau/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-comment\" data-canonical-url=\"https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/80977158\">  <div class=\"d2-comment-embedded\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Comment\"> <div class=\"d2-left-col\"> <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/14951312\" title=\"View Iridate\u2019s profile\"> <img class=\"d2-avatar\" src=\"https://avatar.guim.co.uk/user/14951312\" height=\"40\" width=\"40\" alt=\"User avatar for Iridate\"> </a> </div> <div class=\"d2-right-col\"> <div itemscope itemprop=\"author\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"> <a class=\"d2-username\" href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/14951312\" title=\"View Iridate\u2019s profile\" itemprop=\"url\"> <span itemprop=\"givenName\">Iridate</span> </a> </div> <div class=\"d2-permalink\"> <a class=\"d2-datetime\" href=\"https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/80977158\" title=\"Link to this comment\" itemprop=\"datePublished\">11 August 2016 1:29pm</a> </div> <div class=\"d2-body\" itemprop=\"text\"><p>To speak in a language that the &quot;captains of industry&quot; on here will understand.

I have worked in the industry under both a nationalised system under BR, a privatised passenger company and presently a freight company. A centralised national system operates far more effectively for obvious reasons. Train Operating Companies are given huge taxpayer subsidies and run trains on the nationalised Network Rail which provide infrastructure improvements and maintenance paid for by the taxpayer. <br></p> <p>Any profit is then creamed off by the franchise holder which is often a foreign multinational company. This money does not circulate within the British economy but probably helps to fund employment or investments outside the UK or even worse make the wealthy wealthier. In my personal experience the number one motive for profit often conflicts with the costs of operational safety systems. The entire UK railway industry should be nationalised as a good deal for the taxpayer and above all to end the conflict between public safety and profit. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57ac6c1de4b024cdec3d68fa\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/james-walsh\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-11T12:16:00.010Z\">1.16pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>We\u2019ve had a response <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/live/2016/aug/11/should-our-rail-services-be-renationalised-live-debate?page=with:block-57ac60ede4b0fe7550974c41#block-57ac60ede4b0fe7550974c41\">to an earlier reader contribution</a> from Ross Easton at Network Rail.

Now it is happening to Southern/GTR: the ticket office closures and conductor reforms were imposed by the DfT when the franchise was renewed in summer 2015; and as Peter Wilkinson of DfT put it, anyone who disagreed with those reforms could \u201cget the hell out of his industry\u201d. <br></p> <p>The irony is that if Southern was truly privatised, it would have the flexibility to meaningfully negotiate with the unions and make concessions - as it is, because the reforms are contractual obligations, they can offer nothing significant without the government agreeing to modify the contract. Nationalisation, under a Conservative administration, would result in these \u2018reforms\u2019 being inflicted across the British rail network. That isn\u2019t to dismiss the concept of nationalisation - in the long-term, I believe nationalisation of the rail industry is potentially beneficial. But simplistic advocacy of the concept as a panacaea for our current ills, without really understanding the background to the current situation, or considering the potential pitfalls, does nothing to advance the idea as a viable possibility. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57ac66d6e4b024cdec3d68d8\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/guardian-readers\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-11T11:53:55.485Z\">12.53pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Do we need controls over prices?</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>An interesting comment from one person below the line:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-comment\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/live/2016/aug/11/should-our-rail-services-be-renationalised-live-debate#comment-80974051\">  <div class=\"d2-comment-embedded\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Comment\"> <div class=\"d2-left-col\"> <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/10859336\" title=\"View AlexEvs\u2019s profile\"> <img class=\"d2-avatar\" src=\"https://avatar.guim.co.uk/user/10859336\" height=\"40\" width=\"40\" alt=\"User avatar for AlexEvs\"> </a> </div> <div class=\"d2-right-col\"> <div itemscope itemprop=\"author\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"> <a class=\"d2-username\" href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/10859336\" title=\"View AlexEvs\u2019s profile\" itemprop=\"url\"> <span itemprop=\"givenName\">AlexEvs</span> </a> </div> <div class=\"d2-permalink\"> <a class=\"d2-datetime\" href=\"https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/80974051\" title=\"Link to this comment\" itemprop=\"datePublished\">11 August 2016 12:49pm</a> </div> <div class=\"d2-body\" itemprop=\"text\"><p>Another long suffering Southern commuter here. The main issue is the model of Southerns franchise - a listed company (with the associated responsibilities to provide a return to shareholders) having no control over ticket prices, so it's only method of providing increased returns is by slashing costs. This has been done by methods such as removing trolley services (almost overnight, last year) and not employing enough drivers (and relying on overtime to fill their rosters). They are an awful company who hold their passengers in contempt.</p> <p>On the other hand there is the inevitable march of progress. Thameslink run DOO trains on the same line without any negative implications. Ultimately, the next generation of trains after this may well be driverless. The RMT is anti-progress, and their action is only about protecting jobs or roles that will become obsolete. It happens in every industry. For them to dress this dispute up as being safety focused is utter crap - their short notice sickness driving short notice cancellations has made the trains/platforms/concourses incredibly dangerous through overcrowding - some of the scenes inside carriages with broken down air conditioning and packed to the rafters give lie to the RMT's claimed motivations. They are an awful union that hold Southerns passengers in contempt.</p> <p>Therefore neither protagonist has the solution here - and as other readers have mentioned the nationalised Network Rail is another basket case. I'm not sure what the solution is, but something needs to be done...I assume along the lines of other rail franchises where they have control over pricing etc rather than just running a service for a fee.</p></div> </div> </div>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57ac60f5e4b024cdec3d68b3\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/christianwolmar\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-11T11:34:30.786Z\">12.34pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Privatisation was a terrible idea, but renationalisation is not a panacea</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Rail privatisation was a terrible idea. It caused a series of accidents in the short-term, which fortunately have now been dealt with by added safety measures. Additionally, in the long-term it resulted in hugely increased costs and profits for a private sector that took no risk and made little investment. However, renationalisation is not a panacea that will bring about massively reduced fares and more punctual trains. Network Rail is already in the state sector in any case and bringing the rest under government ownership will take time. No government would attempt to buy back the rolling stock which is leased out to the train operators. That is simply uneconomic. Overtime, more trains could be ordered direct by the government or its agencies but as carriages last 30 years or so it will be a long time before these can be all in the public sector.</p> <p>In terms of train operations, the issue is more complex. It was a mistake to separate operations and infrastructure as, traditionally, the two are so interconnected. Bringing back franchises in-house and gradually recreating an integrated railway would be a good idea. However, as these franchises are likely to have many years to run when a new government takes over, renationalisation will remain an aspiration rather than a reality. There will be benefits in terms of efficiency by bringing together operations and infrastructure, and no longer having to pay profits to the private sector, but these will be fairly marginal. There are many other transport policies which a Labour government should focus on.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57ac60ede4b0fe7550974c41\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/james-walsh\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-11T11:28:08.475Z\">12.28pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">'Renationalising the operating companies is a red herring'</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>A counterpoint view from Bridgitte Lin, a passenger - or customer, if you prefer - from Retford.<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The railways are already nationalised and have been since 2003.

GTR, Southern\u2019s contractors, are in most ways agents of Whitehall. They have to give all the ticket money direct to the government and are just paid a fee. Even the delay payments to passengers are paid by the department for transport. This may not be nationalisation but it certainly isn\u2019t privatisation either. Every detail of the service has to be agreed with officials. It was Whitehall\u2019s terror of the rail unions that led to the bone-headed inflexible response to the April strike (causing the current mess).</p> <p>The problem with either nationalisation or this kind of privatisation is that they both lead to centralised inflexibility and disdain for passengers.</p> <p>It leads to poor labour relations and neither seems to lead to any kind of responsiveness. Or imagination come to that.</p> <p>Is there another way? My own preference would be for a wider group of potential franchisees, which were transparent enough for users to influence, and for everyone to see clearly where resources are going. Some of those bidders ought to be mutually owned, preferably by their staff (in a similar way to Waitrose or Welsh Water). They could hardly do a worse job than now. Staff have proved themselves in the recent crisis dealing with furious passengers, unsafe platforms and no information with courage and imagination. It\u2019s time we harnessed that for the wider railway.</p> <p><em>David Boyle is the author of Cancelled, a book about the Southern crisis.</em></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-08-11T12:13:17.102Z\">at 1.13pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57ac44fee4b0fe7550974ba3\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/sarah-marsh\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-11T10:21:41.802Z\">11.21am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Welcome to our debate</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>It\u2019s been a week when the state of Britain\u2019s fragmented rail network has again been on the agenda, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/09/southern-rail-strike-war-of-words-heats-up-on-second-day\">strikes on Southern and a planned one on Virgin East Coast services</a>.

Even before this passengers on southern trains have complained of weeks of delays, cancellations and a reduced timetable amid staff shortages. So, what\u2019s going on with our rail services and how can it be improved?</p> <p>Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has a solution: renationalisation. Corbyn said the \u201cmisery\u201d that those travelling to London on southern rail have faced makes a \u201cvery good case\u201d for a change of ownership.</p> <p>\u201cI want to see Southern back in public ownership. I don\u2019t believe it\u2019s fulfilling its obligations under the franchise it was given, \u201c Corbyn said.</p> <p> He has also argued that rail renationalisation would bring to an end \u201crip-off\u201d fares, arguing that with regional transport authorities would focus on the interests of travellers over profits.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"621071099c86c11abe807131bf511916dffc576b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/621071099c86c11abe807131bf511916dffc576b/0_0_3788_3096/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Southern tail protestor\" width=\"1000\" height=\"817\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>However, others claim that private expertise allows for our rail services to be run more effectively, with improvements in customer service and ease of booking. <br></p> <p>Some argue that the answer is longer franchises. South West Trains, operating out of Waterloo and owned by Stagecoach, has arguably benefited from being the longest-running franchise. <br></p> <p>But with <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/minister-defends-british-train-tickets-being-more-expensive-than-ones-on-the-continent-10460110.html\">fares rising above the rate of inflation</a> because of the cost of massive upgrades in track and stations which for years were starved of investment, there remains public appetite for major change. Still: if fares were to fall, money would have to come from somewhere, and Theresa May\u2019s government seems unlikely to instigate such radical changes to the network. </p> <p>What do you think?

To the uninitiated in the history and chemistry of the party, the split might look puzzling. Smith says he\u2019ll spend \u00a3200bn and build a zillion homes, the Corbyn camp doubles the stake and raises it again to \u00a3500bn and a gazillion homes. Corbyn until this contest had few policies beyond an amorphous \u201canti-austerity\u201d, so when Smith put flesh on the bones with strings of new policies, he jolted Corbyn into producing some too. The great divide is less visible to the uninitiated \u2013 Corbyn\u2019s incompetence in the basics of opposition as the country faces nation-threatening Brexit decisions.</p> <p>Whether or not the entire 515,000-strong Labour membership gets to vote, the practicalities have become near impossible.

Local officers are volunteers, expected to vet all new members, maybe 500, by Friday to check they are who they say they are on the electoral register, and not members of rival parties.</p> <p>This election should now be delayed until after the party conference, with speeches there from both candidates. An appalling state of chaos? Yes, but that\u2019s likely to be Labour\u2019s fate for the foreseeable future. If there is indeed a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/10/leader-expelled-leftwing-group-militant-peter-taaffe-readmission-labour-corbyn\">chance of the leftwing group Militant being allowed back in</a>, its leader Peter Taaffe a toxic blast from the past, then battle lines are even more clearly drawn between those who see Labour as a rebellion \u2013 where Corbyn has spent his entire political life \u2013 and those who know its mission is to seek power to govern.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s clear I\u2019m the underdog,\u201d says Owen Smith candidly. His team thinks the trend is in their direction, cheered by the vote of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/10/gmb-union-backs-owen-smith-labour-leader\">grassroots GMB union membership</a> in his favour. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/08/labour-must-allow-all-members-leadership-vote-court-rules\">Corbyn\u2019s supporters sweeping the board in the national executive committee elections</a> is not as bad it looks, they say, as Eddie Izzard siphoned off some of the votes and they say phone-bank calls to members are more encouraging. But this feels like whistling in the dark.</p> <p>The bitter truth is that in the current climate, the case for social democracy sounds dull, compared with great far-leftist rallies. The Corbyn believers have the best of it, buoyed by pure conviction. Faced with the roiling upsurge of left- and rightwing passions, social democrats across Europe and the US fail to inspire. Like Hillary Clinton, the 172 Labour MPs refusing to back Corbyn are accused of being boring, mediocre, weak material for the 140-character blast of politics now.</p> <p>What a miserable role to be the realist pricking the balloons of those free spirits. To argue for the necessity of winning is to be a cynical compromiser. Those Labour MPs are seen as greedy power-grubbers hanging on to their seats at all costs, as current polling suggests some 90 will lose theirs. That\u2019s not their personal tragedy: it means <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/11/labour-heading-for-catastrophic-defeat-says-former-corbyn-aide-neale-coleman\">Labour in parliament will be so depleted</a> that it can never pass a single amendment to whatever an untrammelled Tory government wants to do. Nothing will matter more to the country\u2019s future than the Brexit decisions ahead. Theresa May would be mad not to seize her honeymoon moment to sweep those seats from Labour before those bitter decisions must be taken.</p> <p>How much easier to go with the romance of the impossible, in the warm embrace of like-minded dreamers. Those I most admire are those on the left, who started out with Corbyn, who have now seen the disaster ahead. Those who know that abandoning all hope of power is to abandon those who benefit most from a Labour government that the party exists to champion. The bookies give Corbyn an 18% chance of being the next prime minister. That matches the pollsters\u2019 finding that only <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/jeremy-corbyn-says-labour-leadership-campaign-responsible-for-partys-poor-poll-rating_uk_57a3227ee4b02c0180841f89\">18% think he would make the better prime minister</a>, against 52% for Theresa May, as 2.5 million of the too few who voted Labour last year now <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/theresa-may-jeremy-corbyn-comres-poll-labour-tories-prime-minister-who-would-be-better-voters-a7141171.html\">say May would be the better leader</a>.</p> <p>However much this Labour self-slaughter feels like a reprise of the 1980s, there will be no split, learning from that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jan/26/labour-party-split-sdp-candidate\">failed SDP attempt</a>. The electoral system that binds Ken Clarke in the same grip as Liam Fox must force Labour\u2019s irreconcilables to stick together. Until our monstrous electoral system is reformed to free people to form parties that better reflect voters\u2019 wishes, the two old parties must remain as bitterly dysfunctional factions locked in a deadly electoral embrace by first-past-the-post.</p> <p>Labour realists talk of the long haul. How long? Another three or four elections? If Corbyn crashes in a general election, he may stay, or another only slightly more electable may take his place. There is no point is looking for silver linings, and lights at the end of this tunnel look far away. A pall of gloom hangs over the party\u2019s MPs as they watch the whoops and thrills of Corbyn rallies, signifying nothing. Labour\u2019s apparently \u201chuge\u201d new membership is only a homeopathic drop in the ocean of the great electorate out there.</p> <p>A new stoicism has descended on them: they will stay resolutely on the back benches, fighting their hardest against every damned Tory act of meanness to the poor, gifts to the rich and shrinking of the public realm, knowing they themselves may not be the ones that see their party back to power. But they know democracy always rights itself in the end. And there is still just a chance that Owen Smith could win, an outside chance.</p>",

The most common conviction was for drunk driving, followed by miscellaneous assaults and simple traffic offenses.</p> \n<p>This comes as Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) claims it has narrowed the criteria it used under a started in 2008 called Secure Communities that contributed to a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jan/23/democrats-call-on-obama-to-end-deportation-raids-on-women-and-children\">record number of deportations under Barack Obama</a>. Under the program, federal officials ask local jails to hold undocumented immigrants they arrest in custody so that they can be transferred to federal immigration detention centers. </p> \n<p>In November 2014, Homeland Security director Jeh Johnson said a new program called the Priority Enforcement Program (PEP) would focus on \u201ccriminal aliens\u201d convicted of felonies or several misdemeanor offenses. In fact, the most recent data shows ICE now targets people with no criminal record at a slightly higher rate than before.</p> \n<p>ICE said it could not comment on an analysis performed by an external organization. But spokeswoman Sarah Rodriquez said the agency \u201ccontinues to make significant strides \u2026 through PEP to ensure a common-sense approach that focuses enforcement resources on convicted criminals and individuals who threaten public safety and national security\u201d.</p> \n<p>The agency says it also tries to consider \u201cimportant community policing needs\u201d. But here too, it may be be falling short. </p> \n<p>\u201cThe policies they are implementing are not keeping anyone secure,\u201d said Maria Sotomayor, an undocumented immigrant who lives in Philadelphia, and who met with Johnson in May when he tried unsuccessfully to convince the city to implement the PEP program, which would have ended its \u201csanctuary city\u201d policy that keeps ICE and police separate. </p> \n<p>\u201cI told him that because of these detainers, an immigrant who is a victim of a crime will think many times before calling the police to make a report because we could get picked up too,\u201d recalled Sotomayor.</p> \n<p>Before PEP was officially implemented last year, at least 377 local law enforcement agencies were refusing to honor some or all requests to hold immigrants in detention from ICE. The agency says 17 of the 25 jurisdictions with the highest number of declined detainers are now participating in the program.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"5a66255a-cc79-416b-9f19-99ad578f5f5a\" data-atom-type=\"explainer\"> \n  <div>\n   -\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Meanwhile, immigration advocates have sued to obtain more details how the PEP program actually differs from its predecessor. </p> \n<p>\u201cWe suspect this PEP program was just a name change,\u201d said Jessica Bansel, legal director of the National Day Laborers Organizing Network. </p> \n<p>For example, while ICE can now ask local jails to simply inform them when an immigrant is in custody, not to detain them, Bansel noted the agency also has two new detainer forms that are specifically designed to request custody of a person who recently entered the country illegally, but has not been convicted of a crime and is not a security risk. </p> \n<p>\u201cThis sort of makes the whole thing a joke,\u201d said Bansel.</p>",

The improved offer values the retailer at \u00a3610.4m. </p> <p>Steinhoff\u2019s chief executive, Markus Jooste, also made clear that the offer was \u201cfinal\u201d and would not be increased.

Steinhoff already owns Harveys and Bensons for Beds in the UK.</p> <p>Last month, it emerged that rebel investor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/14/steinhoff-may-need-to-increase-offer-for-poundland\">Elliott Capital Advisors had taken control of a 13.2% stake</a> in Poundland.

Steinhoff, whose biggest shareholder is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/aug/27/christo-wiese-south-african-billionaire-prepares-for-move-to-uk\">Christo Wiese, who also owns stakes in New Look, Iceland and Virgin Active</a> through the Brait investment vehicle, already owns 23.6% of Poundland\u2019s shares so it would be possible to block its bid with a 19.1% stake \u2013 25% of the remainder. </p> <p>Because schemes of arrangement only take into account those who vote, either by proxy or at a special court meeting, if some shareholders choose not to vote at all, Elliott\u2019s stake could already be large enough to derail the takeover.</p> <p>\u201cThe 5p rise in the Steinhoff bid for Poundland is a pretty modest victory for shareholder activism,\u201d said independent retail analyst Nick Bubb, who suggested the small increase in the offer price would mean Elliott would \u201cbarely make it a profit\u201d for its efforts. Elliott declined to comment.</p> <p>Poundland\u2019s chairman, Darren Shapland, said the deal offered shareholders the chance to cash in their shares at \u201can improved price and on an enhanced premium to Poundland\u2019s undisturbed share price\u201d. </p> <p>\u201cSteinhoff continues to share our vision for the growth and expansion of Poundland and, as such, we believe they are a suitable and appropriate partner for our colleagues, suppliers and stakeholders,\u201d he said. </p> <p>At noon on Thursday, Poundland shares were down 2.5p at 221.5p.</p>",

As a result, it is crucial that DfID has central systems in place for staff to classify, rate, escalate and monitor these risks with confidence, said Dr Alison Evans, Icai\u2019s chief commissioner and the report\u2019s author.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got so many different ways that food aid, for example, can end up in the wrong hands,\u201d said Evans. \u201cYou have to have more than one strategy for working out where that asset ends up.\u201d</p> <p>Unlike most other donors, DfID decentralises its fiduciary risk management to country offices, where the staff responsible for programmes are known as \u201csenior responsible owners\u201d. Evans said this focuses attention on the changing risk environment, encouraging personnel to implement management systems autonomously and work with local partners to control fiduciary risk more effectively.</p> <p>But there is a downside. Because DfID lacks a clear, overarching risk-management system, and country offices categorise and rate risks themselves, there is a huge variation in how risks are defined and assessed across the department\u2019s work in conflict areas.

DfID was given a \u201cgreen-amber\u201d rating, indicating that its fiduciary risk management in conflict-affected states, though mostly satisfactory, required urgent attention in some areas.<br></p> <p>A number of senior staff expressed concern about the frequency with which decision-making was driven by \u201creputational considerations\u201d rather than fiduciary risk itself, said Evans.</p> <p>\u201cHow do you manage that political tension? We found that to be a very live discussion, particularly in environments where DfID is trying to work with local partners, or where DfID is working in unfamiliar territory, of which Syria is a good example,\u201d she said. Staff can be torn between working with a smaller, local partner (which can mean a higher fiduciary risk) or a larger (potentially lower risk) private sector partner. Fearful of the \u201creputational risk of a possible loss or diversion of aid funds\u201d, the larger partner is often chosen, despite a <a href=\"https://www.odi.org/projects/2696-localising-aid-budget-support-southern-actors\">2013 report by the Overseas Development Institute showing that local aid frequently delivers equal, or greater, development returns</a>.</p> <p>\u201cThere is not a long track record for this,\u201d added Evans. \u201cHow far DfID goes in working with these organisations, and how quickly, is a matter of balancing both fiduciary and reputational risk \u2026 [But] there is a certain concern that DfID is putting a lot of its eggs in particular baskets with certain contractors.\u201d This narrowed the pool of potential suppliers and possibly reduced value for money, said Evans.</p> <p>DfID\u2019s dependence on taxpayers\u2019 money meant it was up to staff to protect and spend that money as effectively as possible, said a DfID spokesman, making the department likely to \u201cerr on the side of caution\u201d in assessing risks. He added: \u201cThere are of course challenges to providing life-saving aid in some of the most difficult and dangerous places in the world, including disasters and war zones, which is precisely why we have such a rigorous system of checks and measures in place.\u201d </p> <p>The report found DfID to be at its most effective when using technological innovations to manage fiduciary risk, particularly in countries where access is limited. In Somalia, where the department has only a limited presence in the capital, Mogadishu, and is instead required to work primarily out of the Nairobi office, using third parties to deliver assets, tracking technology has been deployed to follow money and assets in real time. A similar programme, tracking pharmaceuticals, was used in DRC.</p> <p>\u201cThat seemed to show to us how [DfID\u2019s] decentralised system really plays up to its strengths,\u201d said Evans. \u201cWe feel DfID could do a better job spreading this experience across its portfolio and learning how it might be applied in other contexts.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>Once Kate Downing and her husband Steve did the math, it was obvious that if they wanted to raise a family, staying in Palo Alto, California, was not an option. Although Steve, 33, works as a software engineer at a nearby Silicon Valley technology company and Kate, 31, is a product attorney at another tech firm, the cost of owning a home near their jobs has simply become too steep for them.</p> <p>If they wanted to purchase their current house \u2013 which they rent with another couple for $6,200 a month total \u2013 it would cost $2.7m plus monthly mortgage and tax payments of $12,177, adding up to more than $146,000 a year.</p> <p>Instead, the couple will soon relocate 45 miles south to Santa Cruz, a city by the beach where they can afford to purchase a home and eventually raise children.</p> <p>The Downings\u2019 housing struggle in the northern California region that is home to many of the world\u2019s wealthiest tech companies carries a special irony due to Kate\u2019s second job: up until this week, she served as a planning and transportation commissioner for Palo Alto \u2013 a position in which she pushed city officials to build more housing and pass pro-development policies that could help solve the growing affordability crisis.</p> <p>Kate vented her frustrations about the dangerous housing shortage in Silicon Valley in a Wednesday post on <a href=\"https://medium.com/@katevershovdowning/letter-of-resignation-from-the-palo-alto-planning-and-transportation-commission-f7b6facd94f5#.4hm5t0cqb\">Medium</a> announcing her formal resignation from the Palo Alto planning and transportation commission.</p> <p>The letter, which has spread on social media, sheds light on a harsh reality of the intensifying housing crunch that the California tech boom has greatly exacerbated in recent years.

Also, the number of people travelling the migrant route across the Mediterranean to Italy has increased again.\u201d</p> <p>While the fence is supposed to be a temporary measure, fears that the crisis could be prolonged were heightened when the government <a href=\"http://svet24.si/clanek/novice/slovenija/56b907d375320/razkrivami-vlada-tajno-kopici-nove-zaloge-rezilne-zice\">signalled its intent</a> to fence its entire 670km border with Croatia in December. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/08/migrant_fence_construction/giv-31075nIzY9ZYGDh2C/\" data-alt=\"Border fence location\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/08/migrant_fence_construction/giv-31075nIzY9ZYGDh2C/\">Border fence location</a> </figure>  <p> Researchers from the University of Ljubljana report of several tonnes of razor wire being stockpiled in the open at military barracks near the Croatian border, ready to be unfurled at short notice. </p> <p>Its deployment could be fast-tracked by an amendment to the state border control law that is currently being debated.

Stretches of the barrier are already covered by vegetation or seasonally submerged by the 292 km-long Kolpa river, which straddles the two countries\u2019 border.</p> <p> Many of the deer are thought to have strayed into the fence while foraging. Once snagged, they propel themselves further into the concertina wire in a bid to escape, only tangling themselves further before eventually dying from blood loss, or exhaustion. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"19dad072edfb341f038bd1e5e375608eaf250d34\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/19dad072edfb341f038bd1e5e375608eaf250d34/0_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A dead deer on a campsite in Radenci in Slovenia\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A dead deer snagged on the fence in Radenci in Slovenia.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Martin Lindic</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p> Zrinka Domazetovi\u0107, head of biodiversity in Croatia\u2019s environment ministry, said that: \u201cwhen an animal is tangled in wire, you see it right away. Other impacts, which can have an even more detrimental impact on wildlife, cannot be so easily seen.\u201d</p> <p> Conservation scientists say that the greatest threat to wildlife comes from two-metre-high panel fences which are increasingly being used along the barrier\u2019s route to mollify public opposition to the razor wire.</p> <p>New and as yet unpublished research by Slaven Reljic, one of the PLOS Biology paper\u2019s authors, suggests that hemming in the region\u2019s 1,500 bears for longer than a decade would assure their irreversible decline.</p> <p>\u201cIn Croatia the annual bear-hunting quota is set at 10-15% [of the entire population] and in Slovenia it can reach almost 20%,\u201d he said. \u201cIf the two populations are closed in, neither will be sustainable.\u201d</p> <p>The picture is further darkened by a \u201ctrophy-hunting\u201d trend towards killing the largest bears \u2013 older males which command the highest prices. That results in a disruptive competition between juvenile bears which struggle to take their place, Reljic says.</p> <p>But hunters\u2019 associations in both countries may play an important role in conserving the bear populations they depend upon, according to regional academics. As well as monitoring the animals, many hunters detain poachers, build gates in the border fence and even lure animals back from the razor wire with food dispersals.</p> <p>This is vital work because, as Domazetovi\u0107 puts it, \u201cbears and wolves don\u2019t understand political borders\u201d. One collared bear, named after Slaven Reljic, crossed the national boundary three times last year in a six month period.</p> <p></p> <p></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"3b9f6802369b084138fbce4f149d9835c24da6b5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3b9f6802369b084138fbce4f149d9835c24da6b5/0_307_4928_2957/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Zdenka \u0160tucin, a judge from Ljubljana who opposes the fence\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Zdenka \u0160tucin, a judge from Ljubljana who opposes the fence.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Arthur Neslen/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Hostility to the fence is widespread in the Upper Kolpa valley where the rampart snakes through.

Peter Madronic, a young campsite worker, said the refugees were too \u201cculturally different\u201d from Croats to be integrated.</p> <p> \u201cMost people think that the fence is useless or senseless but I have a lot of contact with the police and they told me that migrants trying to cross the border here can be returned if we have a fence,\u201d he said. \u201cWithout it, they cannot.\u201d</p> <p>Another Croatian campsite owner, Martin Lindi\u0107, whose land in Radenci borders the fence, said that the structure was absurd, as humans could bypass it by crossing a local bridge.</p> <p> \u201cWhen the military forces came here and began fixing the fence, it felt like some kind of military occupation was starting,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople got organised and we cut the concertina wire during a demonstration against the fence.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"86c2042977b458dd8324c52125cbb67e4135779c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/86c2042977b458dd8324c52125cbb67e4135779c/240_0_3600_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A deer that had been caught in the fence.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A deer that had been caught in the fence.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Martin Lindic</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The authorities removed sections of the razor wire in the protest\u2019s aftermath. More fencing was removed after a Croatian complaint to Brussels that it breached the birds and habitats directive.</p> <p>A spokesperson for the European commission said that the Slovenian government\u2019s activities were being \u201cmonitored closely\u201d. A European court case could follow. </p> <p>Since the days of the former Yugoslavia, the beautiful hilly landscape has been a popular tourist site for rafting, canoeing, kayaking and fishing. Dragan Arih, a ranger in Croatia\u2019s Risnjak national park, said that extending the barrier to his forest would be \u201cterrible, awful, catastrophic\u201d.</p> <p> \u201cThe animal migrations would be stopped and when the Kolpa floods \u2013 as it did last year \u2013 the wire would be claimed by the river and then you have another problem for the fish \u2013 and for the tourists.\u201d</p> <p> The president of the Fara tourist authority, Dr Stanko Nikolic, an 85-year-old physician from Belgrade who moved to Slovenia half a century ago, said that there had been a 50% decline in regional tourism revenues since the wall was built.</p> <p> The valley was once a borderless frontier for rural Croats and Slovenes who felt more in common with each other than with their capital cities.</p> <p> \u201cThere are still a lot of contacts between people on both sides of the river,\u201d Nikolic said. \u201cThey want to remove this \u2018temporary\u2019 fence. If it becomes permanent, I\u2019m afraid that our common life will collapse into two fragments.\u201d</p> <p> The fence had already caused the deaths of \u201cseveral dozens\u201d of local animals, he added. Such estimates though, are contested. A new survey by the Slovenian hunting association, the Slovenian government\u2019s accredited monitor, will say that only around 15 animals, have died on the wire so far, mostly red deer.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"56017eac1586e6328600a7c03696609d163fa36d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/56017eac1586e6328600a7c03696609d163fa36d/0_0_3000_2000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Croatian and Slovenian people protest against the border fence in December 2015\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Croatian and Slovenian people protest against the border fence in December 2015.

Igor Barbara, secretary of the Croatian hunting lodge, said that seven red deer had been killed in the 10km stretch of fence bordering his hunting ground alone. He had found others with razor lacerations, floating dead in the river.</p> <p> Lindi\u0107 cited another 10 deer killed on his small section of the barrier. He also claimed to have seen several retreats by animals which had become enmeshed in razor snarls. A bear had also been entangled before escaping, he said. </p> <p> \u201cI think that about 100 animals have died from entanglement on the fence,\u201d Lindi\u0107 told the Guardian.</p>",

Works of nonfiction literature, such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/28/samar-yazbek-syria-the-crossing-interview\">The Crossing</a> by Samar Yazbek and <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Burning-Country-Syrians-Revolution-War/dp/0745336221\">Burning Country: Syrians in Revolution and War</a> by Robin Yassin-Kassab and Leila al-Shami, have been published around the world, revealing the Syria beyond the headlines. And in 2016 alone, Syrian documentary and design featured in an abecedarium at New York\u2019s MoMA, the British Museum has collected works by Sulafa Hijazi, Al Shaab Alsori Aref Tareekh. And Comic4Syria for a new archive, and in September Avo Kaprealian\u2019s film <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ltp0IyUpXEY\">Houses Without Doors</a>, about living in besieged Aleppo, will premiere at the <a href=\"https://www.ica.org.uk/whats-on/season/safar-film-festival\">Safar film festival</a> in London. Dissident Syrian creatives, once hidden and far away, are now as close as the internet \u2013 or even the gallery or cinema down the road from you. </p> <p>So, in a time when Syria\u2019s creative output is more accessible than ever, the west should not dismiss it as something threatening or alien \u2013 these are the voices that we should be listening to, as we consider Syria\u2019s future.</p>",

  "<h2><strong>Monday</strong></h2> <p>I\u2019m shadowing the junior doctors, whom we will replace on Wednesday. It feels very alien to answer calls with \u201cFY1 doctor here\u201d after being a medical student for so long. Given the recent events in the NHS over the past year regarding the junior doctors\u2019 contract, my morale towards starting my first job is low. Today I am working on the wards along with another junior doctor. It is not too busy and we get to go home at 5.30pm. I spare a thought for our colleagues on other wards, who do not make it home until 7pm or 8pm.</p> <h2> Tuesday</h2> <p> There are normally three FY1s on call but due to sickness and annual leave there are just two of us. A lot of patients are anxious as we do not yet know what is wrong with them, when they can go home or if they need an operation. To make things worse, there are not enough slots for all of them to have their CT scans done today. </p> <p> In the afternoon, I get a bleep from my registrar, asking me to come and assist in theatre. Later, my colleague and I are handed an ECG from a patient with chest pain and he goes to assess if she\u2019s had a small heart attack. I offer to finish some more jobs for him as he is very busy with this sick patient. It has been a long day but I have felt appreciated by all members of staff I have worked with, and I am a little less nervous about tomorrow.</p> <h2> Wednesday</h2> <p> The stabilisers are off. It is the first day I am officially an FY1, along with 28 others in the hospital. My anxiety is eased by my supportive registrars who emphasise that I can call them whenever I have questions. In the midst of a high-pressure moment, I accidentally prick my finger with a needle while taking blood. Not only am I embarrassed, I have to go to occupational health and I feel guilty about leaving my colleagues with one less doctor for 45 minutes. The to-do list keeps growing so I stay an extra hour to avoid handing over too many jobs to the evening on-call team.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/feb/05/the-secret-junior-doctors-diary-after-40-minutes-of-chest-compressions-we-stop\">The secret junior doctor's diary: 'After 40 minutes of chest compressions, we stop'</a> </p> </aside>  <h2> Thursday</h2> <p> The night on-call FY1 hands over a very sick patient on the ward as soon as I arrive. Today tests our teamwork and delegation skills, as our sick patient requires discussions with various other departments and we are all nervous about approaching senior doctors whom we are not familiar with. While we review the patient, her family arrives and my colleague and I update them on their relative\u2019s situation. As I go to inform another patient that he needs to be started on a drip to correct some abnormal blood results, he is upset to learn he cannot go home today and I, too, wish he could be at home, without the endless intrusion of doctors and nurses.</p> <h2> Friday</h2> <p> As I am on a week of night shifts from Monday, I have today off. I may not physically be at the hospital but I can\u2019t stop thinking about one of my unwell patients from yesterday. I take some time at home to update my online portfolio, which is a requirement for us to progress past this year and in our careers. I can\u2019t help texting my colleague to check on the patient from yesterday. I am happy when she replies to tell me he is much better and even walking around the ward. </p> <p>Before Monday, the NHS had been sold to me as an overstretched, uncaring and outdated body. It may be busy, and there may be a very steep learning curve, but I have genuinely enjoyed my first week. Among other things, the level of support I have received from my peers as well as my seniors has restored my faith in our healthcare system, and I would urge everyone to take the sensational headlines about its failures with a pinch of salt.</p> <p></p> <p><em>If you would like to contribute to our <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/healthcare-network/series/blood-sweat-and-tears\">Blood, sweat and tears series</a> which is about memorable moments in a healthcare career, please read our <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/healthcare-network/2015/jul/14/healthcare-workers-tell-us-about-memorable-experience\">guidelines</a> and get in touch by emailing <a href=\"mailto:sarah.johnson@theguardian.com\">sarah.johnson@theguardian.com</a>.</em></p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/healthcare-professionals/?CMP=dis-166\">Join the Healthcare Professionals Network</a> to read more pieces like this.

  "<p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <blockquote> <p><em>Since Windows Mail is going out, what would you recommend for another free email server? What about Gmail? I have Windows 10. Thanks,</em> <strong>Laurel</strong></p> </blockquote> <p>I answered <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/2016/jun/02/microsoft-killing-windows-live-mail-what-should-i-do-hotmail-msn-outlook\">a topical question about Microsoft\u2019s changes to Windows Live Mail</a>, which I fondly imagined answered everybody\u2019s questions. The result was roughly three dozen confused emails. I\u2019ve tried to cover most of the points raised, but apologise for picking on Laurel. She sent the shortest question, not, by a long way, the most confused one.</p> <p>Most of the confusion is Microsoft\u2019s fault. Once upon a time, it wanted people to use Windows Live Mail to collect mail from its Windows Live email service. Well, it should be easy if they both had the same name, right? Now it wants people to use Outlook (a Windows or smartphone app) or Outlook (a Microsoft Office program) to collect their email from outlook.com (a mail service), which is even more confusing. It\u2019s no wonder people get them mixed up.</p> <p>In fact, no version of Windows Mail is going away, and nobody needs to change to a different email service. Even Windows Live Mail 2012 is still available, though it doesn\u2019t follow Microsoft\u2019s modern finger-friendly style, and the Windows Live Essentials suite is being phased out.</p> <p>Yes, you may need to change your email settings, but ONLY if you use Windows Live Mail 2012 (the PC email program) with a Microsoft email service such as Hotmail, Live, or outlook.com.</p> <p>If you use Windows Live Mail 2012 with any other email service \u2013 for example, if you have a BT, Virgin, Comcast, Yahoo, Gmail or other email address \u2013 then you don\u2019t need to change anything. You are not affected. This does not concern you.</p> <h2><strong>How we got here</strong></h2> <p>Microsoft started this mess by writing to people who used Windows Live Mail with Microsoft email accounts to say that Windows Live Mail would stop working by 30 June 2016. It was moving all the Microsoft Hotmail and Live Mail accounts to a new version of outlook.com, which Windows Live Mail would not support. Microsoft said users could switch to Outlook, the free email app, or Outlook, the Microsoft Office email program, which it offered free for one year.</p> <p>My answer said that people with Hotmail and Live Mail email addresses could still use Windows Live Mail 2012 with outlook.com if they changed the settings to use the IMAP mail protocol.</p> <p>Well, the deadline has gone, and there\u2019s at least one case where Windows Live Mail 2012 is still working unchanged after an upgrade to Windows 10. I know this because my wife has an old Hotmail.co.uk address, and I\u2019m still waiting for her Windows Live Mail to break.</p> <p>If yours has broken, you will get Server error 3219 and Windows Live Mail error 0x8DE00005, and you will be unable to send or receive messages. This means your mail service has been moved to a new outlook.com server, and you will have to change your email settings manually, or switch to a different email program.</p> <p>Some people changed the settings in Windows Live Mail 2012 to work with the IMAP protocol, as I suggested in June. However, one reader \u2013 Gerry from Sweden \u2013 says this has stopped working: he can receive email but not send it.</p> <p>If you\u2019re in a similar position, with non-working email, the best answer is to change the settings to POP3. Helpful reader Terry Hewitt recently wrote in to say that Microsoft had enabled POP3, so you just have to log on to <a href=\"https://www.outlook.com/\">outlook.com</a> (the website) and turn it on.</p> <p>To do this, click the cogwheel, select Options, and click \u201cPOP and IMAP\u201d in the left hand menu (see photo). Click Yes to \u201cLet devices and apps use POP\u201d but don\u2019t allow them to delete messages. Save your changes and hit the back arrow.</p> <p>After enabling POP3, open Windows Live Mail 2012, create a new account for your old email address, and check the box that says \u201cManually configure server settings\u201d. For \u201cIncoming server information\u201d select POP with the server address pop-mail.outlook.com and Port: 995 with a secure connection (SSL). For the \u201cOutgoing server information\u201d use smtp-mail.outlook.com and Port: 25, or Port: 587 if 25 is blocked. These settings work for me with a hotmail.com address and Windows Live Mail 2012 running in Windows 10.</p> <h2><strong>Where\u2019s the problem?</strong></h2> <p>If you have an email problem, it could be in the mail server on the internet, which receives and stores your email, or in the email program on your PC, which collects it from the server. Here\u2019s a brief guide to which does what.</p> <p>First, the email service provides your email address and hosts your inbox. Most consumer email addresses include the name of the mail service. Examples include gmail.com, yahoo.com, fastmail.com and any local variations such as hotmail.co.uk. (Laurel: Gmail is a great alternative email service, if you don\u2019t mind changing your email address.)</p> <p>Second, an email client program collects your emails from the server, and sends any replies. Nowadays you can access most email services directly, via a web browser, so you don\u2019t have to use a program to do it. However, many people prefer to use client programs, which can handle two or more email services at the same time. They can also provide more powerful sorting, filing and back-up options, and they work even when you are not online. They may be faster, too.</p> <p>Email client programs include Windows Live Mail, Microsoft Office Outlook, Mailbird, eM Client, Mozilla Thunderbird, Pine and many more. You can use whichever you like. Most popular email clients already know the settings for most popular email servers, though sometimes you may have to enter them manually.</p> <p>Third, there\u2019s the operating system, which doesn\u2019t matter. As long as you use a standard client program, email services don\u2019t care which OS you use.</p> <p>Almost everybody uses email, so almost every major operating system comes with a usable email client. This includes Windows, macOS (Mac OS X), Linux, Apple iOS, Google Android and so on. Of course, if you don\u2019t like the bundled email client, you can usually download an alternative.</p> <p>PC manufacturers used to ship Windows Live Mail as the client program on machines running Windows 7, and now they ship the Outlook mail app with Windows 10. But Windows Live Mail still runs perfectly well on Windows 8.x and 10, so you can still use it: you just have to <a href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/17779/download-windows-essentials\">download it</a>.</p> <p>If you have a copy of the Outlook program from Microsoft Office 2007, 2010 or later, that will also work on all supported versions of Windows.</p> <p>However, if you log on to Windows 10 with a Microsoft Account, the Outlook mail app will check your email automatically even if you don\u2019t tell it to. It will also show details of new emails in the Mail tile in Windows 10\u2019s Start menu, without downloading them. The built-in Outlook mail app is therefore the easiest way to start using email in Windows 10, but it\u2019s not compulsory. You can use whatever you like.</p> <p>Either way, if you\u2019re going to write in with an email question, please distinguish between Windows Live (the email service) and Windows Live Mail 2012 (the email program); and between outlook.com (the email service), Outlook (the Windows app) and Microsoft Office Outlook (the email program). It saves time in the long run.</p> <p><strong><em>Have you got another question for Jack? Email it to <a href=\"mailto:Ask.Jack@theguardian.com\">Ask.Jack@theguardian.com</a></em></strong></p>",

Jay Z released a song called Spiritual, along with a quote from the 19th-century abolitionist Frederick Douglass: \u201cWhere justice is denied, where poverty is enforced, where ignorance prevails, and where any one class is made to feel that society is an organised conspiracy to oppress, rob and degrade them, neither persons nor property will be safe.\u201d</p> <p>Beyonc\u00e9 said in a statement posted online: \u201cWe don\u2019t need sympathy.

  "<p>A few miles from his home in south Birmingham, four-year-old Nicholas Bolton is due to start a special needs school for autistic children in September. His mum, Rosalind, and dad, Francis, not only love the school but knew he\u2019d be safe getting there: funded by Birmingham city council, the school minibus has special seats, harnesses and trained guides.</p> <p>But as an insight into what parents of disabled children are currently experiencing up and down the country, last month Rosalind was informed that Nicholas \u2013 who is non-verbal, incontinent, struggles to control his body and can\u2019t understand instructions \u2013 would not be granted specialist transport to school. Instead, the council would assist with travel by offering a free bus pass.</p> <p>\u201cIt took me a while to process it,\u201d Rosalind admits. \u201cI wasn\u2019t sure they could actually be suggesting it.\u201d</p> <p>But they were. The council wanted Nicholas to use a regular bus: not only a standard school bus unsafe for disabled children but \u2013 for a little boy who becomes distressed near strangers \u2013 a public bus alongside commuters, shoppers and students. Because there\u2019s no bus that goes directly to Nicholas\u2019s school, he\u2019d have to take two separate buses, changing midway. Morning and afternoon, an hour there and back in normal traffic. \u201cThat journey would be overwhelming agony for him,\u201d Rosalind says.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It\u2019s like the council saying they haven\u2019t got the money so they\u2019re going to stop collecting the rubbish</p> <footer> <cite></cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Talking to other parents, Rosalind quickly discovered that Nicholas wasn\u2019t alone. Every other disabled child starting at his school this year was being refused specialist transport too. And the more she dug, she found this was happening all over Birmingham.</p> <p>One friend with an autistic child at another school across the city has just been told the entire reception class won\u2019t have specialist transport, Rosalind says. The council, she explains, are \u201ctrying to dress this up\u201d to parents as a way to help their children be independent.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019d love them to go to the local school on their scooters and when they\u2019re older get the bus to senior school with their mates. That is never going to happen, and the council knows it,\u201d she says. \u201cBy \u2018independent\u2019, they mean independent of the council.\u201d</p> <p>In the current climate, independence for severely disabled children is a budget cut by another name. Travel Assist, the part of Birmingham city council that provides transport services, has been told it must find \u00a32.8m, a local councillor informed parents, according to Rosalind. When approached for comment, Colin Diamond, director for education at Birmingham city council, tells me the council has received \u201csignificant grant cuts from central government and these have affected all parts of the council, including Travel Assist\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s like them saying they haven\u2019t got the money so they\u2019re going to stop collecting the rubbish,\u201d Rosalind says.</p> <p>The law states that a child with a disability that would prevent them walking to their nearest suitable school must get free transport help regardless of distance (non-disabled children must live more than three miles from their school to be eligible). But <a href=\"http://www.cafamily.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Contact a Family</a>, a charity that supports families with disabled children, tells me some local authorities are now trying to cut corners to save money. They regularly hear from families whose child is clearly eligible for school transport but have been refused help.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/28/universal-credit-payments-delays-loans\">The farce and the agony of trying to get universal credit payments | Frances Ryan</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The result is parents who are already exhausted, faced with shrinking services, left living in a logistical nightmare. Without safe transport for Nicholas, Rosalind, who works in utility regulation, would need to drive her son to school in the morning, get to the office, leave to collect Nicholas in the afternoon, and get his 18-month-old sister to and from childcare.</p> <p>\u201cMy husband has epilepsy so he can\u2019t drive,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ve worked out I\u2019d be left with about four and half hours at work. I\u2019d have to quit my job.\u201d</p> <p>Childminders or after-school clubs \u2013 typically untrained to look after disabled children \u2013 aren\u2019t an option for families like Nicholas\u2019s. There used to be a specialist after-school club at Nicholas\u2019s school. \u201cThat funding\u2019s been withdrawn now,\u201d Rosalind says.</p> <p>A few days after we last spoke, Rosalind emails with good news: following an official appeal to the council, Nicholas has been told he\u2019s eligible for a place on the specialist minibus. Rosalind is relieved but hesitant. \u201cI feel like it\u2019s a battle we\u2019re going to have every year,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd there\u2019s all these other parents who are still going through this now.\u201d</p> <p>She tells me about a single mum at Nicholas\u2019s school who\u2019s already struggling with money but, without transport for her autistic child, would have to give up her one remaining job. Another friend with two autistic children was planning to get back into nursing part time, she says, but now doesn\u2019t think she\u2019ll ever be able to work again.</p> <p>Diamond says the council will \u201calways endeavour to ensure support for getting children to school is safe and cost effective, and enables children to be as independent as possible. Any parent or carer who feels the assistance provided is not appropriate is able to appeal.\u201d</p> <p>But with only a few weeks until the start of term, Rosalind worries other families won\u2019t have time to appeal before their child needs to start school. \u201cThe council is seeing disabled children as an easy target,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s just horrible.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Thermomix is under investigation by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission over safety complaints and reports it imposed confidentiality requirements on consumers seeking compensation for faulty products.</p> <p>The ACCC began the investigation in March, two months before the consumer group Choice <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/may/12/thermomix-products-reponsible-for-45-injuries-says-consumer-group-choice\">filed a mass incident report</a> detailing 87 complaints about faulty products.

  "<p>A southern American classic, the red velvet has <a href=\"http://www.foodtimeline.org/foodcakes.html#redvelvet\">its origins</a> in the 19th century, when cakes as soft and fine as that fancy fabric were the height of culinary fashion. And although the colouring came much later \u2013 <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/14/dining/red-velvet-cake-from-gimmick-to-american-classic.html\">variously said</a> to stem from the faint reddish hue that results from a collision of alkaline bicarbonate of soda with acidic cocoa, or the \u201cred\u201d brown sugar sometimes used \u2013 by the mid-20th century, it had become the cake\u2019s calling card. One early recipe, printed in Texas\u2019s Amarillo Globe-Times in the summer of 1960, calls for four tablespoons of food dye.</p> <p>Mississippi native and Saveur magazine food editor Ben Mims <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.saveur.com/article/Kitchen/Sweet-Southern-Dreams\">explains the red velvet\u2019s attraction</a>: \u201cThe deep crimson cake against the luminous white frosting is pure Southern drama.

But we were missing the point; while a red velvet cake should taste of cocoa, vanilla and buttermilk, it is chiefly distinctive for its soft, silky texture and aggressive crimson colour. If you don\u2019t want a red cake, you should probably make something else. If you want something for tea that could stop traffic, read on.</p> <h2>The batter</h2> <p>That fine, silky texture should be smooth rather than fluffy; moist, but never dense. For a really soft, tender crumb, there needs to be a higher proportion of fat than in your standard sponge, and that fat should be butter. I try vegetable shortening, as suggested in Carolyn A Knutsen\u2019s recipe, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1977/04/25/archives/de-gustibus-red-velvet-cake-returns-tomato-paste-lingers-on.html?_r=0\">published in the New York Times in 1977</a>, and a mixture of vegetable oil and butter, as pastry chef <a href=\"http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2012/01/let-them-eat-natural-red-velvet-cake-recipe.html\">Maria del Mar Sacasa</a> recommends on the Serious Eats website, but neither comes close for flavour.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"02966e1e89cabf9f55ac6b15bd1add53d3d21a84\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/02966e1e89cabf9f55ac6b15bd1add53d3d21a84/0_0_3648_2736/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Carolyn A Knutsen\u2019s red velvet cake.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Carolyn A Knutsen\u2019s red velvet cake.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The distinctive tang of red velvet is part of its attraction, and most recipes get this from a combination of buttermilk and vinegar. These acidic ingredients not only help to balance the richness of the butter, but react with bicarbonate of soda to create bubbles, further aerating the batter. <a href=\"http://www.myrecipes.com/recipe/red-velvet-layer-cake\">Southern Living</a> chooses sour cream over buttermilk, but my testers find the cake too fudgey and dense, \u201calmost like a brownie\u201d. It turns out you <em>can</em> add too much fat.<br></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.saveur.com/article/Recipes/Red-Velvet-Cake-1000089787\">Mims</a> uses baking powder rather than straight bicarbonate of soda; an odd decision given that baking powder already contains acid and, in theory, should have no need of any more, which might be why his cake has a slightly odd flavour. That said, my panel come out strongly in favour of del Mar Sacasa\u2019s cake for texture, which uses both \u2013 it\u2019s lighter than the others, without being at all dry, so I\u2019m going to take the bare bones of my recipe from her.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"576f3e6ae51806de56ea246d8d60613185d04853\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/576f3e6ae51806de56ea246d8d60613185d04853/0_0_3648_2736/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cook\u2019s Country\u2019s red velvet cake.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cook\u2019s Country\u2019s red velvet cake.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>The colour</h2> <p>With the velvet part of the recipe sorted, it\u2019s time to turn my attention to the red bit, which proves more problematic. The first three I make are definitely brown velvet cakes, which sounds like something you might take to a 70s-themed party. I realise belatedly that the natural food colourings I\u2019ve used are not what the industry might term \u201cbake stable\u201d, so I apologise to <a href=\"https://www.americastestkitchen.com/search?q=red+velvet+cake\">Cooks Country magazine</a> and Knutsen for their sad-looking cakes.</p> <p>The colour of Del Mar Sacasa\u2019s cake, however, is entirely deliberate; she\u2019s not a fan of \u201cthose bright carmine cupcakes peddled by overhyped bakeries\u201d, which she describes as \u201cdry, stale and lacking in flavour and substance\u201d. For some reason, this translates into a refusal to use food colourings; instead she goes for pureed beetroot and red wine, which gives her cake a warm reddish brown colour. It tastes delicious, but I don\u2019t really get the point. If I wanted a red wine and chocolate cake, I\u2019d make one.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"39005518257ff7c25b24afccc0f48a455b32bf3a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/39005518257ff7c25b24afccc0f48a455b32bf3a/0_0_3648_2736/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Maria del Mar Sacasa\u2019s red velvet cake.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Maria del Mar Sacasa\u2019s red velvet cake.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A red velvet cake should be unapologetically, showstoppingly gaudy \u2013 the baked equivalent of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/dolly-parton\">Dolly Parton</a>. And for that, I\u2019m afraid, you need artificial colourings of the sort used by the pros \u2013 they\u2019re <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.souschef.co.uk/intense-red-colour.html#feefo\">easily available online</a>, or from specialist baking suppliers. If you\u2019d prefer to avoid them, I\u2019d dispense with any kind of colouring \u2013 beetroot adds its own flavour, and this is not the kind of cake that would consider \u201cearthy\u201d a compliment.</p> <p>You also need to keep the rest of the batter as pale as possible, which rules out Del Mar Sacasa\u2019s dark brown sugar, or indeed Knutsen\u2019s generous hand with the cocoa. A hint of chocolate, and a hint of vanilla, is all that\u2019s required; Del Mar Sacasa adds almond extract, too, but again, this falls into the nice-but-not-red-velvet category.</p> <p>A word about the cocoa: most recipes call for \u201cDutch process\u201d powder, which has been <a href=\"http://www.seriouseats.com/2014/08/difference-dutch-process-natural-cocoa-powder-substitute.html\">treated to neutralise some of the acidity</a> (which means that it won\u2019t react with the bicarbonate of soda to make the cake red, though given the amount of colouring they use, this is neither here nor there). In Europe, almost all cocoa is treated in this way so, if you\u2019re based here, this isn\u2019t something you need to worry about. If not, check the packaging.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"19c8ceea0ad70bf02ff01dfe167c27e0850e3894\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/19c8ceea0ad70bf02ff01dfe167c27e0850e3894/0_937_2736_1849/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Southern Living\u2019s red velvet cake.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"676\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Southern Living\u2019s red velvet cake.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>The icing</h2> <p>Sorry, \u201cfrosting\u201d.

In Mims and Del Mar Sacasa\u2019s versions, it really does melt in the mouth. It\u2019s a bit more work than cream cheese, but well worth it. The latter flavours hers with more wine and blood orange juice and zest (not that I could find a fresh blood orange in August), but plain vanilla is more traditional.</p> <p>Knutsen gives a recipe for an even more curious icing that puzzles me still \u2013 butter, egg yolks and sugar are whisked together over a gentle heat until thickened, and then mixed with raisins and pecans to give a kind of chewy toffee which can be spread, with some difficulty, over the delicate cake beneath. It\u2019s delicious\u2026 but it doesn\u2019t feel much like icing.

The authorities are saying that\u2019s where they\u2019re headed, so we\u2019re hopeful.\u201d</p> <p>When the service goes in to public beta at the end of the year, Amiqus will also feature a rough guide to how much a particular case will typically cost to take to court. This is based on the team\u2019s experience of similar cases.</p> <p>While access to this legal information will be free, the app will point interested parties to mediators from whom it will receive a commission for any business the app generates. Murray intends to add further areas of law to the app. </p> <h2>Free the law</h2> <p>In the US, the <a href=\"https://free.law/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Free Law</a> project is more advanced than Amiqus. The initiative is the result of legal analytics company <a href=\"https://www.ravellaw.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ravel Law</a> combining its data interrogation tools with Harvard Law School library to get North American case law scanned and made searchable online. Ravel Law co-founder Nik Reed says the project was born out of a frustration that while some elements of government, such as the <a href=\"https://open.whitehouse.gov/\" rel=\"nofollow\">White House</a>, were starting to become open, the justice system was not one.</p> <p>\u201cOpen government holds a lot of promise but as a lawyer I knew the law was years behind a lot of departments,\u201d Reed says.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s ok if you\u2019re a judge or studying at a top law school, you can go to the library and look up case law for every state, but for the average person, there\u2019s no way you\u2019re going to be able to find out what the law thinks of any situation you may have. That has to be wrong.\u201d</p> <h2>Publishing for free</h2> <p>For Reed the real issue is that some states had allowed their court judgment data to be put online by third-party publishers but they usually charged for access to rulings. He believed this was unfair because, by definition, the law of the land and the way it is interpreted by a judge should be free for all citizens to access. That is when the idea struck to approach the one place he knew had every court case ruling for the whole of the US: the Harvard Law School library.</p> <p>\u201cThey were incredibly excited about the proposed project to get case law made openly available because they could see the law belongs to us all,\u201d he says.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media-network/2016/may/04/data-londoners-fitness-olympic-park-tfl-strava\">Can data help a million Londoners get fit?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cSo we devised a way that each state\u2019s case law books could be guillotined at the spine by a clever machine so we can scan each page and get it online. We mend them straight afterwards, of course. Each court case is scanned in one at a time. We\u2019ve got 40m pages to get through. It takes around a week to scan in half a million pages, so we\u2019re working on releasing one state at a time.\u201d</p> <p>New York was the first state to go live on the system last November. California, Delaware, Massachusetts, New Jersey and Texas have all since followed, and Illinois is expected to be next.</p> <p>The business plan for Ravel Law is that while anyone can go online and search for case law surrounding their query, lawyers are able to pay for an extra service which interrogates the data further. This enables a lawyer to search for how a particular judge views various aspects of the law.</p> <p>\u201cLawyers are prepared to get a little extra help to know more about how a judge they\u2019re up before has decided similar cases in the past,\u201d Reed says. <br></p> <p>\u201cThe public\u2019s use of the system is more about seeing where they stand in the eyes of the law and it\u2019s usually used to avoid going to court. A typical case is a guy I chatted to recently who didn\u2019t think he was liable to some charges he was being asked to pay at the end of his tenancy. So he looked up similar case law on our system and printed off the documents to prove to his landlord that he was correct and the final bill was amended without the pair having to go to court.\u201d</p> <h2>Free data, but costly, advice</h2> <p> </p> <p>If a person has a complaint against a reasonable person or company, the Free Law initiative and the Amiqus app can offer legal information so both sides can see what the law states and how judges interpret that law, and hopefully prevent court action. However, neither services can do anything about the high cost of legal advice and representation that could ultimately put someone off taking their grievance to court, no matter how right they are to do so.</p> <p><strong><em>To get weekly news analysis, job alerts and event notifications direct to your inbox, </em></strong><a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/media/\"><strong><em>sign up free for Media &amp; Tech Network membership</em></strong></a><strong><em>.</em></strong><br></p> <p><em>All Guardian Media &amp; Tech Network content is editorially independent except for pieces labelled \u201cPaid for by\u201d \u2013 find out more </em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sponsored-content\"><em>here</em></a><em>.</em></p>",

These were supposed to be filled in by athletes and include anthropometric information (e.g. measurements of the body) as well as details of athletes\u2019 families, background, basic medical history, and so on. Response rates were low, and so the committee set up an at-Games team of physiologists to take measurements and x-rays and do ergonomic research. In the end systematic data from about 2000 athletes was collected (about half the total number of competitors that year).</p> <h2>A heritage to benefit the health of future generations?</h2> <p>Despite the poor returns and reluctance of athletes to take part, sports scientists were not discouraged, and after the Rome Games two \u2013 Dr Joseph B Wolffe, a heart specialist based in the USA, and Dr Giuseppe La Cava, an Italian sports doctor \u2013 <a href=\"http://europepmc.org/abstract/med/14099077\">came up with a new scheme they called the Olympic Medical Archives</a>. This was a variation on the yellow/blue cards, except that the information collected would be deposited in a single archive, hosted by the IOC, and updated every four years regardless of whether an athlete competed in the Olympics or not \u2013 that is, ex-sportspeople would be traced and followed up every four years, even after they stopped competing. Participants would be awarded with a certificate, a lapel pin, and the warm glow of knowing they were contributing to scientific progress.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f5a0258f14c2d8b3c453ad62dd4a305f44858ad8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f5a0258f14c2d8b3c453ad62dd4a305f44858ad8/0_498_2670_1603/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Black and white photo.

The forms were massive: seeking basic demographic information, full length photographs, questionnaires about lifestyle and habits, a 22-question \u201cpsychologic evaluation\u201d (which asked questions like \u201cwould you want to be known as\u2026 favourite to win [or] Dark Horse\u201d), and extra gynaecological questions for female competitors. The results of blood and urine analysis, of ECG tests, and X-rays all had to be included in the three-part booklet, and returned to the OMA.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjBpbvhi6XOAhUG0RQKHSTZBLQQFggeMAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fbjsm.bmj.com%2Fcontent%2F2%2F1%2F25.full.pdf&amp;usg=AFQjCNG2RG-xv12OCEk1APEWQDgkTPvmlw&amp;sig2=UB-olXSzGVSJMNfv3ViUbg&amp;bvm=bv.128617741,d.d24\">The British Olympic team made a valiant attempt to fill in the forms</a>, returning one for 86 of their 203 competitors, although this cost them around \u00a3150 in administrative fees alone (not including the cost of tests, examinations and x-rays, which were mostly provided for free by private healthcare services). \u00a3150 was about the cost of sending a single athlete to the Rome Games, so this was a non-trivial expense. In poorer countries, or those with fewer biomedical facilities, the forms were simply impossible to complete. In all, only 1121 forms were returned in 1964, out of 5,151 athletes competing.</p> <p>Wolff remained determined to make this work, because he believed it would create data that <a href=\"http://library.la84.org/OlympicInformationCenter/OlympicReview/1976/ore101/ore101t.pdf\">could answer crucial questions not just about sport and performance, but about everyday health</a>. <a href=\"https://www.ucl.ac.uk/chinahealth/newsx/10-09-2010\">In his words</a>: \u201c[t]he causes and treatment of disease have been studied through the centuries.

The British team \u2013 which had produced one of the largest returns in 1964 \u2013 decided not to participate because Mexico already required significant medical preparation (vaccines and training for altitude) which was taking up the athlete\u2019s patience. Added to this was the sudden death of Wolffe in 1967, which seems to have put an end to the project. Although athletes were studied physiologically at the Mexico City Games, no mention was made of the OMA scheme in the official report of the Games.</p> <h2>The secrets of sporting success</h2> <p>The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munich_massacre\">tragedy at the 1972 Munich Games</a>, with the kidnap and murder of eleven members of the Israeli team, led to a tightening of security at subsequent Olympic events; this meant restrictions on the personnel that could travel with teams, and made it much harder for scientists to attend as part of a study or survey project. Distrust had always been a problem for the physiological surveys (not all countries had participated even in the yellow/blue card scheme). In 1980, although the Moscow organising committee set up a \u201cphysiological testing station\u201d, British athletes were warned via their official handbook not to attend without checking with their team doctor first. The dream of gathering data to benefit \u201cthe whole of mankind\u201d as part of a collaborative, shared, scientific project, got lost in the reality of international sports; too expensive, too time consuming, and too open.</p> <p><em>Vanessa Heggie is the author of <a href=\"http://www.manchesteruniversitypress.co.uk/9780719091285/\">A History of British Sports Medicine</a>, published by Manchester University Press (hardback 2011, paperback 2013).</em><br></p>",

It is to use one\u2019s own life, one\u2019s own emotions and experiences, to stand in for someone else.

It\u2019s part of your life.\u201d</p> <p>Whereas screen actors have to summon that once, perhaps for a few takes in a row, stage actors have to do so night after night after night.

Tom Mothersdale [who played the torturer Tinker] found he had this underlying rage.\u201d<br></p> <p>\u201cThe process of training or rehearsing is really good at getting you inside the world of a play, inside the mind of a writer or the psyche of a character, but there\u2019s nothing about dropping it,\u201d Terry points out. Several studies have shown that actors are particularly susceptible to mental health issues.</p> <p>There are different schools of thought on acting and emotion. Some, from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2012/apr/17/modern-drama-konstantin-stanislavsky\">Constantin Stanislavski</a> to Lee Strasberg, stress the equivalence of actor and character, pushing performers to replicate the emotional states they are representing. Others, Diderot first, then Vsevolod Meyerhold and <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/wednesdays-book-true-and-false-heresy-and-common-sense-for-the-actor-by-david-mamet-faber-pounds-999-1158544.html\">David Mamet</a>, advocate detachment: a kind of \u201cjust do it\u201d approach.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"2d00a393b12ec37f044d8c43db0482a7d2a5e2f6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2d00a393b12ec37f044d8c43db0482a7d2a5e2f6/0_0_1914_2888/663.jpg\" alt=\"Just do it \u2026 David Mamet.\" width=\"663\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Just do it \u2026 David Mamet.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: International/Rex Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Dutch psychologist <a href=\"https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=kbcGfeaYfQ4C&amp;pg=PA8&amp;lpg=PA8&amp;dq=elly+konijn&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Y5zHQygha5&amp;sig=sKHdzt7dUFm6ssQTtKieP-CthSw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj9jLO1wKLOAhXGLMAKHX9GDN0Q6AEIZTAO\">Elly Konijn</a> has looked into this. Her research proved that, although actors (even method actors) don\u2019t experience the same emotions as their characters, they do undergo heightened emotions \u2013 largely as a result of being on stage in front of an audience with a job to do. It\u2019s a highwire act, live performance, the psychological stresses of which one medical study has likened to \u201ca small car crash\u201d. That might explain the adrenaline rush actors feel immediately after coming off stage, and the strange hangover that can come the next day.</p> <p>There\u2019s a curious duality in this, a kind of split-consciousness, as if actor and character coexist in performance. \u201cIt\u2019s an interesting state,\u201d says Ben Miles. \u201cOn the one hand, you\u2019re behaving, psychologically and physically, like someone else. At the same time, it\u2019s you doing it.\u201d To be seen and heard, actors have to remain aware of their situation, yet they have to give in to it as well. \u201cIt\u2019s a sort of trance-like state \u2013 I don\u2019t mean running around boggle-eyed and dribbling, but a mix of control and complete surrender.\u201d</p> <p>Even if their feelings aren\u2019t equivalent, actors are nonetheless indivisible from their parts. They can\u2019t escape themselves on stage. Hence the old saying: there are as many Hamlets as there are actors. Each brings something of themselves to every role. \u201cWe\u2019re all capable of being many different things,\u201d Terry says. \u201cWhat happens is that you\u2019ll access those bits of you that fit.\u201d</p> <p>There is, therefore, an element of self-discovery in playing somebody else. For Terry, it means \u201cunearthing bits of yourself, and depending on how near the surface or how dormant they are, that determines whether it\u2019s painful or not\u201d. Actors rarely open up about these things, certainly not outside of rehearsal rooms. It can be a very private process: whatever gets you into a role. \u201cIt\u2019s never self-indulgent, though. You\u2019re never using it as therapy.\u201d</p> <p>That act of entwining, of identifying with a character, cuts both ways. Just as the actor puts themselves into a part, so that part can creep into the actor. When we speak, Terry is in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/jun/23/henry-v-review-open-air-theatre-regents-park\">Henry V mode</a> and, uncharacteristically, she has found herself pulling rank. When her director brought a drill sergeant into rehearsals to put the cast through their paces, she resisted. \u201cI went: \u2018Absolutely not. You\u2019re not shouting at me for two hours.\u2019\u201d In a writers\u2019 meeting a few days later, she found herself pitching idea after idea about conflict. \u201cThey were like: \u2018You\u2019re doing Henry V, aren\u2019t you?\u2019 You only clock what\u2019s happening to you gradually.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"eff48ec537518a39b2f0b6693c602d2962418758\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eff48ec537518a39b2f0b6693c602d2962418758/80_194_3161_1897/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kate Fleetwood in Macbeth.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">As Lady Macbeth, Fleetwood wrung the blood from her hands almost 300 times.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>That can unlock things for the good. Henry has forced Terry to take ownership of authority, something she says she naturally shies away from, while playing Titania unlocked some newfound sexuality. \u201cI don\u2019t live my life like a sexy woman, but my partner pointed out that it\u2019s in me. If I chose to, I could.\u201d Acting, then, can be liberating; a way of playing out other versions of yourself, almost rehearsing for life. After finding herself typecast as victims, Terry pushed for assertive, assured roles; it was a way of discovering \u201cwhat it means to take responsibility for your own identity. That can be incredibly empowering. Once you put a part down, you come to crave being that person again.\u201d</p> <p>All this means that actors carry characters around with them \u2013 sometimes for years. Miles still catches himself thinking of Thomas Cromwell, <em>as </em>Thomas Cromwell, a year after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/jan/09/wolf-hall-bring-bodies-swan\">Wolf Hall</a> ended, while Terry occasionally finds herself caught off-guard when her life echoes something she has lived out on stage \u2013 a chance phrase or a fleeting look. \u201cQuite a few times, I\u2019ve flinched in recognition.\u201d</p> <p>For Fleetwood, it is more controlled: her past characters lying dormant, their mental and emotional states ingrained through repetition. \u201cYou can turn it on and off,\u201d she says. \u201cI can be sat in traffic and take 30 seconds to check someone\u2019s still in there. It\u2019s bizarre.\u201d</p>",

The cataclysmic nature of its sudden loss \u2013 as opposed to abandonment, or transformation over time, or devastation by enemy force \u2013 served not only to stop the remaining inhabitants literally in their tracks, but to conserve traces of their lives, and very bodies, as if frozen in time.</p> <p>Between the rows of terracotta pots and assorted amphorae that are packed into the forum\u2019s granary in the manner of an ancient lost property office, a figure crouches in palpable despair, its hands raised in a bid to cover its face. Although arranged much like the empty vessels on either side, this ghoulish form embodies human remains discovered by Amedeo Maiuri, Pompeii\u2019s chief archaeologist from 1924 to 1961.<br></p> <p>Following a technique pioneered by the director of excavations in the 1860s, Giuseppe Fiorelli, Maiuri\u2019s team poured plaster into the void left by the body in the hardened volcanic ash. The resulting cast is commonly known as the \u201cmuleteer\u201d, or mule man, after the skeleton of a mule or donkey found nearby. For Maiuri, he was \u201clike a beggar on the church steps \u2026 A tragic figure from one of Dante\u2019s circles of hell.\u201d<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"e822ef18708b49c487b6cfcfc523aa56089b6e60\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e822ef18708b49c487b6cfcfc523aa56089b6e60/0_196_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tourists look at a body cast during their visit the archeological site of Pompeii\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018A tragic figure from one of Dante\u2019s circles of hell\u2019: a body cast at Pompeii.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Roberto Salomone/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Today, visitors show their sympathy for this pitiful, hunched Pompeian by throwing loose change into a fountain bowl that has been placed invitingly at his side.<br></p> <p>The urge to share our humanity with the mule man signals the enduring immediacy and emotive power of the hundred or so plaster casts made since the 19th century: the lost city\u2019s living dead. It doesn\u2019t matter that we might be looking at a reproduction. As we peer through railings and dusty cabinets at the slightly twisted body of a tiny toddler or the contorted form of a dog, still struggling to break free from its collar and chain as it was subsumed by the lethal surge, history seems to play out in front of our eyes.<br></p> <p>Thus Pompeii has the power to \u201cturn people on to the Romans\u201d, says the renowned classicist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/mary-beard\">Mary Beard</a>. Her <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/pompeii-9.html\">bestselling book</a> and television documentaries (her second on Pompeii, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b072nxtm\">New Secrets Revealed</a>, was screened earlier this year) demonstrate how scholarly research and scientific analysis such as CT scanning are busting stereotypes and enriching understanding of daily life in the town \u2013 which was less a city, as Beard points out, and more a <a href=\"http://www.visitsaffronwalden.gov.uk/\">Saffron Walden</a> of the Roman world. It was a prosperous yet provincial colony of the empire, with a population of somewhere between 10,000-20,000, of which around 1,150 bodies have been found.</p> <p>For the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/pompei79?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">archaeologist Sophie Hay</a>, it is not simply the state of preservation that makes Pompeii so special, but the new light she and fellow researchers are helping to shed on the everyday experiences of non-elite Romans \u2013 soldiers, street traders, slaves \u2013 and even those who came before the Romans. In Pompeii, the ordinary is extraordinary: old loaves of bread burned to a crust; disturbingly familiar-looking surgical tools.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"023152006e26cd0a60ad121c435a6c44ed72915a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/023152006e26cd0a60ad121c435a6c44ed72915a/0_0_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Plastic sheets cover the remains of a house in Pompeii.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Plastic sheets cover the remains of a house in Pompeii.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alessandro Bianchi/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Walking in the grooves made by Pompeians and their carts in the streets, we find the ancients speaking to each other loudly and clearly, from the mosaic doormat spelling out <em>Cave canem</em> (Beware of the dog) to the graffiti they scratched on the walls: \u201cAntiochus hung out here with his girlfriend Cithera\u201d; \u201cI screwed the barmaid\u201d; \u201cEpaphra, you are bald!\u201d<br></p> <p>A proverb inscribed on a wall of the basilica \u2013 \u201cA small problem gets larger if you ignore it\u201d \u2013 looks prophetic with the volcano looming in the background.

But they let the NBA all-stars know that if they\u2019re able to leverage this undeniable team spirit and manic intensity into a gold medal game appearance, it\u2019s going to be a bar fight.</p> <p>There will be joyless individuals out there who tell you that even this was only possible because the US team arrived without the three best players in the world and just had an off night. Those same people will also probably scold you for playing Pokemon Go and enjoying Fast and Furious films. But how about this: this US team <em>does</em> have 12 of the best 15 players in the world.

Never.\u201d</p> <p>She said that the banned substance found in her urine, octopamine, could occur naturally after eating seafood. She said that when failed the drugs test, during competition in Costa Rica in spring 2014, she was breastfeeding her third child and was taking no medication at the time. \u201cAny mother knows that if you breastfeed you can\u2019t take anything,\u201d she told the Guardian.</p> <p>As for the alleged seafood link, she said: \u201cWe proved this, the microbiology, everything.

If somebody think that somebody take, then he take also. Because if you are clean you think everybody is clean. I don\u2019t believe when I hear that somebody have problem with doping, I don\u2019t believe. I think there has been some mistake, because I don\u2019t believe that somebody take this.

It\u2019s a schlep around the Grumari circuit, the 25 kilometre loop which featured in both road races and has two fairly stiff climbs (not to be confused with the VIsta Chinesa Circuit, whereAnnemiek van Vleuten, VIncenzo Nibali, Geraint Thomas and Sergio Henao all crashed on the descent). Pooley looked more than at home on the Grumari on Sunday as she gave the peloton a good tow around it. <br><br>In the men\u2019s time trial, Chris Froome and Thomas go for Team GB, the latter a late entrant after the high rate of attrition in the road race having left a few vacancies in the starting line-up.

I\u2019ll save the superlatives for those on the ground enjoying writing on it late into the night. </p> <p>But (I dig this stat) it now makes Phelps the 39th most successful country in the history of the Olympics. Cop that.</p> <p>And it\u2019s a longevity story as well. He first competed in the pet event at Sydney in 2000, coming fifth as a 15 year old lad. That was 5804 days ago. Or just short of 15 years and 11 months, if that\u2019s how your brain works. Think about what you were doing then.

  "<p>Most employers will at some point have to confront allegations of bullying at work. Putting procedures in place as well as managing difficult conversations with the individuals involved is beneficial, not just in the short-term by resolving conflicts, but also by helping create a more harmonious workplace. </p> <p>Employers can be hit by serious financial, legal and reputational issues if they fail to deal properly with allegations of bullying, from discrimination claims under the Equality Act (if related to a protected characteristic such as sex or age) to claims for breach of contract, constructive dismissal and negligence (if the bullying has caused a psychiatric injury to the individual).</p> <p>An obvious starting point is understanding what bullying is \u2013 but that\u2019s not as simple as it might sound. Bullying does not have a legal definition. The Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service (Acas) does, however, provide useful guidance in its publication <a href=\"http://www.acas.org.uk/media/pdf/o/c/Bullying-and-harassment-at-work-a-guide-for-employees.pdf\">Bullying and Harassment at Work</a> (pdf). It defines bullying as \u201coffensive, intimidating, malicious or insulting behaviour, an abuse or misuse of power through means that undermine, humiliate, denigrate or injure the recipient.\u201d </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>To prevent issues gathering momentum, employers should ensure individuals are treated fairly throughout an investigation</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Harassment, although typically associated with acts of bullying, is a legally separate concept. It is defined as behaviour that causes alarm or distress on more than one occasion in the <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1997/40/contents\">Protection from Harassment Act 1997</a>, and in the <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/15/section/26\">Equality Act 2010</a> as \u201cunwanted conduct related to a relevant protected characteristic, which has the purpose or effect of violating an individual\u2019s dignity or creating an intimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating or offensive environment for that individual\u201d.</p> <p>For example, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/aug/10/half-of-women-uk-have-been-sexually-harassed-at-work-tuc-study-everyday-sexism?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other\">researchers from the Trades Union Congress and the Everyday Sexism Project</a> this week found that 52% of women had experienced unwanted behaviour at work including groping, sexual advances and inappropriate jokes. Among women and girls aged 16-24, the proportion reporting sexual harassment rose to 63%.</p> <p>Employers will naturally want to take a zero-tolerance approach when it comes to tackling this kind of behaviour. However, to prevent issues gathering momentum, you should ensure individuals are treated fairly throughout an investigation. </p> <p>So how can employers handle bullying allegations appropriately?</p> <h2>Have a bullying and harassment policy</h2> <p>A policy stating what behaviour is unacceptable can be helpful when it comes to bullying allegations. Make sure it\u2019s clear, detailed, well-publicised in the office and defines what constitutes bullying and harassment. These terms are quite broad so it\u2019s best to cover a variety of behaviours and to include specific examples.</p> <p>The policy should illustrate what process the organisation will take when dealing with allegations \u2013 how an employee can raise a complaint, how it will be investigated and how unacceptable behaviour will be handled (you can use the company\u2019s equal opportunities and grievance policies to detail this).</p> <h2>Be clear you will handle concerns sensitively</h2> <p>Knowing that an employer will deal with an employee\u2019s concerns sensitively will encourage those who might be too afraid to come forward. It is not always possible to give an absolute assurance about confidentiality, so it is important to be clear with anyone involved in a bullying investigation on what they can expect. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/nov/17/workplace-bullying-cost-uk-acas\">You\u2019re fired! How to get rid of workplace bullying | Stefan Stern</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Anonymised statements can be useful in easing an individual\u2019s worries about their complaints being raised with the accused individual, who will have a right to understand the nature of the complaints against them and to defend themselves. </p> <p>It\u2019s also crucial to impress upon everyone involved that they should keep matters confidential and that victimisation or retaliation will not be tolerated (bearing in mind that even if a complaint of discrimination is not upheld, retaliation could of itself give rise to a claim). An employer should also make sure to keep all involved up to date on progress, understanding that, for reasons of confidentiality, the complainant might not be entitled to know the specific actions taken against the perpetrator.</p> <h2>Handle the difficult conversations appropriately</h2> <p>These can be difficult conversations so it is best to nip the situation in the bud. You can ease a victim\u2019s stressful situation by being sympathetic and talking to them on a human level. This can make it easier further down the line for the complainant and the accused.<br></p> <p>Depending on the circumstances, an informal approach could be the best way to encourage an employee to speak about bullying and allow the accused to speak from their perspective. A formal process can be a daunting prospect for an individual who may already feel isolated and vulnerable.</p> <h2>Offer support</h2> <p>Managing relationships should be an employer\u2019s priority. Throughout the investigation, employers should offer support to all individuals involved. Mediation can be a great way of healing a relationship between two employees and confidential counselling can offer external support for those finding the situation particularly difficult. </p> <p>Often it\u2019s also worthwhile focusing on the solution rather than the precise details of the rights and wrongs of the complaint. Sometimes an effective way forward can be simple, such as changing someone\u2019s duties or work location. </p> <p>Staff turnover, absence, employee performance and morale can all be negatively affected if bullying in the workplace is not tackled appropriately. That\u2019s why it is important that employers make it their priority to manage allegations properly and adhere to any legal obligations. This can make these trickier situations easier and help contribute to a more supportive and positive atmosphere in the workplace.</p> <p><em>Keely Rushmore is a senior associate in the employment team at SA Law.</em></p> <p><strong>Looking for a job?

  "<p>Scottish grouse moor owners have been warned they face much tougher regulation after an inquiry was launched into the disappearance of legally protected golden eagles in the Highlands.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/apr/14/englands-last-golden-eagle-feared-dead\">England's last golden eagle feared dead</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Roseanna Cunningham, the Scottish environment secretary, ordered the review after eight golden eagles vanished in an area of the Monadhliath mountains known for its grouse shooting, south of Inverness.</p> <p>The eight eagles, which had all been satellite-tagged as part of long-running efforts by conservationists to monitor their struggling populations, disappeared in the last five years; the eighth bird, called Brodie, vanished in early July. </p> <p>The warnings came as the shooting industry prepares to celebrate the Glorious 12th this weekend, the traditional start in August of the grouse shooting season, leading to accusations from the industry the disclosures were timed for maximum effect. </p> <p>Conservationists including specialists at Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH), the government\u2019s agency, have long suspected golden eagles are failing to breed in ideal territories in the Highlands, Perthshire and the Borders because of systematic persecution by gamekeepers.</p> <p>The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds Scotland said the latest disappearance added to its fears that these eagles and their transmitters were being destroyed after the birds were shot, trapped or poisoned. </p> <p>None of the missing birds or their tags has been found, said Ian Thomson, its head of investigations, but the close cluster of cases stretched coincidence. There were repeated proven cases of golden eagles being shot or trapped over recent years. </p> <p>\u201cGiven the reliability of the transmitters, the chance of so many birds disappearing over such a short timescale without some kind of human interference is so small as to be negligible,\u201d Thomson said. \u201cThe pattern we see here is consistent with the birds having been killed and the transmitters destroyed.\u201d</p> <p>Cunningham has asked SNH to analyse data gathered on around 90 tagged golden eagles to establish whether there were any clear, suspicious patterns. The latest reports were \u201cvery disturbing and disappointing,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cGrouse moor management does help species such as curlew and golden plover as well as generating much-needed rural employment and income but this cannot be at any price,\u201d Cunningham added.</p> <p>\u201cThe public rightly expects all businesses in Scotland to obey the law. Let me be clear: grouse shooting is no exception. As previously stated, the Scottish government is prepared to introduce further regulation of shooting businesses if necessary. It will be unfortunate if the activities of a few bring further regulation on the whole sector, but that is the risk those who defy the law and defy public opinion are running.\u201d</p> <p>Tim Baynes, director of the Scottish Moorland Group, which represents grouse moor managers and insists it enthusiastically supports bird-of-prey conservation, said he was deeply suspicious about the RSPB\u2019s motives and its conclusions. \u201cThere is no clear evidence of the golden eagles having even died in the Monadhliath area, let alone having been \u2018persecuted\u2019 on grouse moors as the RSPB is alleging,\u201d Baynes said.</p> <p>\u201cIt is now over a month since the disappearance of this latest eagle and it would have been in everyone\u2019s interests if the matter had been raised immediately. There are other explanations for satellite tags stopping working. </p> <p>\u201cWhere there is not a police investigation, as in these cases, contact should be made with local land managers who are often in the best position to help with information. Regrettably, the RSPB has not done this and it is not the first time. The RSPB would appear to be more interested in generating anti-shooting publicity on the eve of the grouse shooting season.\u201d</p>",

Many AC/DC fans are unaware of the singer\u2019s origins and as we approach the recently unveiled, life-size bronze statue, I am already making a mental list of friends I want to bring here.</p> <p>We have arranged to meet John Crawford, chairman of the annual <a href=\"http://bit.ly/2avxN2N\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bonfest</a>, which raises funds for the local <a href=\"http://dd8music.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">DD8</a> youth music group, run by Graham Galloway.

Bon is now honoured with a plaque along with other Kirriemuir notables: Peter Pan creator JM Barrie, geologist Charles Lyell, mountaineer Sir Hugh Munro (who created the famous list of mountains over 3,000ft) and the Cameron traditional music dynasty.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a712bbbc9d921d6df3ff6ac52ebc3a3b8f6aee56\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a712bbbc9d921d6df3ff6ac52ebc3a3b8f6aee56/0_73_5023_3014/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Bon Scott statue, with one of the band\u2019s younger fans.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Bon Scott statue, with one of the band\u2019s younger fans</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jannica Honey/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIt\u2019s been a slow process,\u201d says Galloway, who is cheered by the local minister\u2019s favourable sermon \u2013 given to coincide with inauguration of the statue of the Highway To Hell composer.</p> <p>Graham takes us on a tour of understated Bon locations, which are guaranteed to satisfy the AC/DC trainspotter.</p> <p>The former Scott bakery is now occupied by an embroidery and garment printing shop, where a school photo of Bon shares window space with various articles of clothing including a packet of Sox Inna Box. Nearby, the Star Rock sweet shop, established in 1833, devotes a small section to a basket filled with AC/DC rock. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ed86f0a7095eff684de8fb7c7bd861cead0c264d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ed86f0a7095eff684de8fb7c7bd861cead0c264d/0_127_5023_3014/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A window display at the former Scott bakery.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A window display at the former Scott bakery</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jannica Honey/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Although the erstwhile family home is down a gated cul de sac, a modern housing development on the edge of town has been named Bon Scott Place.

  "<p>Two divergent conclusions can be drawn from Australia\u2019s 10-point loss to Team USA at the Carioca Arena in Rio de Janeiro. For buoyant Australians, the Boomers\u2019 <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-08-11/boomers-match-it-with-usa-in-basketball-epic/7719274\">\u201cepic\u201d</a> group stage performance against the undisputed favourites was a crowning achievement in itself. Australia became the first team to lead the United States after the opening half of an Olympic basketball game since 2004, and pushed their fancied opponents until the final buzzer. </p> <p>But basketball games are not won at half-time, and Andrew Bogut\u2019s post-match comments were telling. \u201cWe still lost the game, it doesn\u2019t mean anything,\u201d explained the imposing centre. \u201cThere\u2019s no small victories.\u201d That attitude shows how far the Australian men\u2019s national team has come.</p> <p> When Australia and the United States last met at London 2012, the Boomers <a href=\"http://www.theaustralian.com.au/sport/us-dream-team-defeats-aussie-boomers-119-86-in-quarter-final/story-fne3ajoz-1226446516540\">\u201cbattled bravely\u201d</a> to a 119-86 defeat.

But while their female counterparts the Opals have been on the podium at ever Olympics since 1996, the same year Longley won the NBA alongside Michael Jordan, the Boomers have struggled in international competition. A Round of 16 exit to Turkey at the 2014 Fiba World Cup was just the latest in a long line of disappointments. A concrete return on investment for the considerable public funding received by Basketball Australia\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/oct/31/inside-australias-basketball-talent-factory\">much-vaunted youth program</a> is long overdue.</p> <p> Before departing for Rio, the word from players and staff was simple. \u201cWith this group there\u2019s that little bit of a sense that it\u2019s time \u2013 we need to do something special on the world stage,\u201d coach Andrej Lemanis <a href=\"http://www.espn.com.au/olympics/basketball/story/_/id/17075647/boomers-do-special-world-stage-coach-andrej-lemanis-says\">admitted</a>. Despite an <a href=\"http://pickandroll.com.au/leaking-roof-cancels-boomers-lithuania-warmup-game/\">interrupted preparation</a>, the Boomers opened their campaign with comprehensive wins over European heavyweights France and Serbia. Fast-flowing attacking basketball and impervious defence saw the 12-man rotation excel at both ends of the court.</p> <p> Led by a 30-point showing from Canberra-born Patty Mills and 11 Matthew Dellavedova assists, the Australians went toe-to-toe with Team USA on Wednesday evening in Brazil. Although they may have proven their credentials as a genuine medal contender, they still lost a game that appeared eminently winnable. The American\u2019s 39% shooting from the field presented the Boomers with a golden opportunity, which a lack of depth and Carmelo Anthony\u2019s final quarter streak prevented them from grasping.</p> <p> Yet the performance by Lemanis\u2019 team does of course augur well with the medal rounds fast approaching. Mills, Bogut and Dellavedova \u2013 each of whom has claimed an NBA championship ring in the past three seasons \u2013 offer a strong core, while 36-year-old David Andersen is demonstrating the value of his ample experience.</p> <p> It is always tempting to ask the \u201cwhat if\u201d questions following a tight loss, and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jul/19/as-olympic-medals-beckon-australias-basketball-future-has-never-been-brighter\">absence of young prospects Dante Exum, Ben Simmons and Thon Maker</a> have left Australia\u2019s bench thin on top-level talent. Equally, though, the Boomers\u2019 opponents were no <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1992_United_States_men%27s_Olympic_basketball_team\">Dream Team</a>.

Now politics holds us back | Alex Wodak</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Harm reduction is usually associated with illicit drugs. But long before there was harm reduction for illicit drugs, there was already harm reduction for alcohol. Alcohol policy wonks in the 1970s used to speak of \u201cmaking the world safe for drunks\u201d. They knew that, like the poor, some hopelessly intoxicated people in public places would always be with us. The idea behind this slogan was, for example, separating drunken pedestrians from speeding traffic. Of course energetic efforts to reduce the frequency and severity of public drunkenness still continued.</p> <p>In 1970, the Victorian parliament made the wearing of seat belts compulsory for drivers and front-seat passengers, the first such legislation in the world. Concerns about the high proportion of road crashes due to drunk driving and the difficulties of reducing such deaths prompted the introduction of this legislation. Seat belt critics argued that drivers would inevitably compensate for their increased safety by just driving faster and more recklessly. Studies showed that the net reduction in crashes, deaths, serious injuries and financial savings was huge.</p> <p>As a young doctor, I quickly became converted to public health harm reduction interventions when shown a scale model of a new wing being constructed at the Alfred Hospital in Melbourne in 1971. The wing had been designed before seat belt legislation had been approved and was being built after seat belts were compulsory. Many beds initially reserved for treating people with complex fractured skulls had now been made redundant and were now available for treating other conditions. I remember the vigorous debate about the introduction of car seat belts.</p> <p>Much like other harm reduction debates, the conflict continued after seat belts had been introduced, eventually dying away long after studies showed clearly the huge savings in deaths, injuries, hospital beds and health care costs.</p> <p>The idea of risk compensation runs through every debate about harm reduction. The notion is that all of us accept a certain amount of risk. If our exposure to risk is decreased, the risk compensation hypothesis suggests that we then increase our risky behaviour to return our overall risk level back to an equilibrium position. Sometimes we actually do increase an unwanted and risky behavior because of a reduced risk exposure. For this reason, it is very important that harm reduction policies are always carefully evaluated after being introduced to make sure that the benefits exceed the negatives.</p> <p>In the 1980s, my colleagues and I were desperate to establish a pilot needle syringe program. Our concern was that Australia was at risk of severe health, social and economic costs from spread of HIV among and from people who inject drugs ending up with a possible generalized epidemic. This concern was widely shared. But all sorts of groundless concerns were raised about needle syringe programs. Could we prove that this wouldn\u2019t send the wrong message? Would drug use start earlier, become more frequent or last longer? Would the sky fall in? </p> <p>My colleagues and I had to resort to civil disobedience \u2013 starting the pilot program ourselves \u2013 to ensure that a needle and syringe policy was implemented before a generalised HIV epidemic occurred. An independent study commissioned by the commonwealth department of health a quarter century later found that between 2000 and 2009, needle syringe programs in Australia had cost $243m but had prevented an estimated 32,050 HIV and 96,667 hepatitis C new infections and saved the economy between $2.48 and $5.85bn.</p> <p>In the 1999, my colleagues and I again had to resort to civil disobedience to ensure that a medically supervised injecting centre was established in Kings Cross \u2013 we started an illegal medically supervised injecting centre in the Wayside Chapel. </p> <p>That year, 1,116 young Australians died of a heroin overdose with 10% of these deaths occurring within 2km of Kings Cross. A dozen independent evaluations of the centre have been strongly positive and found nothing more than insignificant negatives. When he retired, NSW premier Bob Carr said that establishing the centre was one of his ten proudest achievements. Yet fifteen years later, it\u2019s still the only Drug Consumption Room (DCR) in the country. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/dec/01/if-we-want-to-stop-drug-related-deaths-at-festivals-we-need-a-new-strategy\">If we want to stop drug-related deaths at festivals, we need a new strategy | Bill O'Loughlin</a> </p> </aside>  <p>When we suggest that future DCRs should adapt to the changed patterns of drug use and be able to accommodate people who inhale ice, the criticism starts all over again.</p> <p>We follow the same pattern with all the other debates about harm reduction including medicinal cannabis, pill testing, regulation of recreational cannabis, and e-cigarettes: evidence of benefits is minimised while harms and risks are exaggerated.</p> <p>A senate committee in 1977 referred to the \u201cdrug problem problem\u201d, meaning the lamentable quality of the debate about drug policy.

  "<p>A 20-year-old Virginia man seeking an \u201caudience\u201d with Donald Trump used large suction cups to scale the outside of Trump Tower on Wednesday for three hours, reaching the 21st floor before being hauled through a window by police.</p> <p>The climber \u2013 a young, white male with long brown hair and muttonchops \u2013 wore a backpack and used a harness and rope stirrups to fasten himself to the side of the 58-story Manhattan skyscraper, above Fifth Avenue.</p> <p>The man used four suction cup-like devices, each with ropes attached for him to stand on. The building\u2019s windows were apparently too dirty for the cups to attach to, as he frequently stopped to clean the windows before attempting to attach to them.</p> <p>Police officers smashed windows and broke through a ventilation duct in an attempt to block his progress. Officers also lowered themselves toward him using a window washer\u2019s platform.</p> <p>For a long time, the climber played a slow-motion cat-and-mouse game with officers, eluding them by methodically working his way across the facade and the angled corners of the building. The chase ended dramatically just after 6.30pm.</p> <p>As a crowd gasped on the street below, two officers leaning far out of a window frame where the glass was removed grabbed the climber\u2019s arm and backpack, and in a flash yanked him from his dangling stirrups. He went through the opening head first, his legs pointed skyward.</p> <p>Police had deployed large, inflated crash pads at the scene, but it was unclear whether they were positioned close enough to where the man was climbing to offer any protection if he fell.</p> <p>He was speaking with officers through the holes cut in the side of the building. When would-be rescuers smashed a window above him, he ducked to avoid big shards of glass that fell.</p> <p>They collectively inhaled as he was pulled inside. \u201cI\u2019m so disappointed,\u201d a young man said. Others sadly lamented that they missed it.</p> <p>Police blocked off much of 56th Street, the south side of the tower, where the man was climbing. The crowds pressed together in the heat and humidity and spilled onto Madison Avenue. With smartphones and cameras raised, they documented the strange occurrence on Snapchat, Twitter and Facebook Live. In offices nearby, some watched from the windows.</p> <p>\u201cI gotta get this shit on camera. This is hilarious,\u201d one man said. Others wondered if the climber \u2013 whom many were calling Steve \u2013 was getting tired. Another yelled \u201cMake America great again\u201d. Others offered their own theories on why the man was doing this. \u201cIt\u2019s gotta be a protest,\u201d a man said.</p> <p>Some disagreed. \u201cI think it\u2019s just a daredevil,\u201d said Carolyn Gatchell, a nurse from New Hampshire. \u201cI think it\u2019s ironic because it\u2019s a Trump building. I\u2019m anxious to see what he has to say about it.\u201d Gatchell and her husband, Bill, in town on vacation, were at the Empire State building when they saw helicopters near Trump Tower so they headed down to check out what was going on. \u201cI think it\u2019s innocent \u2013 not a terrorist or anything,\u201d Bill added of the climbers\u2019 motivation.</p> <p>The day before, police said, the climber posted a video on YouTube entitled: Message to Mr Trump (why I climbed your tower). </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sP493LmSJrE\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/sP493LmSJrE?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>\u201cI am an independent researcher seeking a private audience with you to discuss an important matter. I guarantee that it\u2019s in your interest to honor this request,\u201d he said in the video. \u201cBelieve me, if my purpose was not significant, I would not risk my life pursuing it. The reason I climbed your tower is to get your attention. If I had sought this via conventional means, I would be much less likely to have success because you are a busy man with many responsibilities.\u201d </p> <p>NYPD assistant chief William Aubrey said the man, who was not named by police, told officers the same thing after he was safely inside the building. </p> <p>\u201cAt no time did he express that he wanted to hurt anybody,\u201d Aubrey added. </p> <p>The tower is headquarters to Trump\u2019s Republican presidential campaign and his business empire. Trump also lives there, though he was in Virginia on Wednesday afternoon and was headed to Florida for an evening event.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4a0b454b2e40ea59e871d1fdc9c163aae6de7ae5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4a0b454b2e40ea59e871d1fdc9c163aae6de7ae5/0_163_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Officers from the NYPD watch as a man climbs the outside of Trump Tower in New York.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Officers from the NYPD watch as a man climbs the outside of Trump Tower in New York.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lucas Jackson/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Kathy, a Trump supporter from Sunnyside, was visiting a friend nearby when she saw the crowds.

She was relieved to find out that he was away . \u201cPeople want to be around him,\u201d she said of Trump. \u201cThey will glom onto anything like him. Look how much attention this guy is getting.\u201d</p> <p>About 20 police officers funneled curious onlookers out of the street so cars could pass unhindered down Madison Avenue.

  "<p>They put a scare into the US basketball team that no one imagined was possible. For most of the game, Australia taunted the best collection of NBA players in the world, throwing up jumpers, shaking the rim with dunks and sending a message that America might not be as mighty as they thought they were.</p> <p>In the end, the flying jump shots of Patty Mills and David Anderson would fall heartbreakingly short. David would not slay Goliath. The Australians who had tormented the US for more than three quarters had no answer to the 31 points of Carmelo Anthony and 19 from Kyrie Irving. They would not conjure the dark memories of the US\u2019s 2004 Athens failures. They fought to the end and lost 98-88.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2016/aug/10/olympic-mens-basketball-rio-2016-australia-usa-live\">Olympic men's basketball: Australia 88-98 USA \u2013 as it happened</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And so died the impossible dream, at least for now. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to take small moral victories,\u201d center Andrew Bogut said. \u201cThis was the best team in the world, we are better than them and we thought we should have been in a position to grind out an even closer game. We\u2019re disappointed, we lost.\u201d</p> <p>And yet they had come so close. If only they hadn\u2019t missed so many layups in the second half. If only a few passes hadn\u2019t gone wide and rolled out of bounds. The mistakes Australia made were of their own impatience. They played fearlessly against a team most fear.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s good for us, it makes us tougher, it makes us harder so the next time we meet them we play even better,\u201d Anderson said. \u201cFor us it was putting everything out there, putting it all out there. We just didn\u2019t finish it off.\u201d</p> <p>No one had thought the US could lose in this tournament. In fact, the question wasn\u2019t so much if the Americans could fall in the Olympics; it was if a team could stay within 25 points. After complete destructions of China and Venezuela in the first two games of Group A play, it seemed the US was poised to rumble through Rio with massive wins every night. Few expected Australia to be the team to challenge the Americans. The favorites were teams like Spain, Argentina and France, not Australia. What Australia did bring, however, and the US might not have understood, was a plucky aggressiveness, a simple yet effective offense of screens and rolls and a solid front court led by Andrew Bogut, Joe Ingles and Aron Baynes. </p> <p>They would not be intimidated the way other countries have been and for more than three quarters they bamboozled the American team, throwing the biggest scare into the US since their last Olympic defeat to Argentina on 27 August, 2004. That was the year America lost to Puerto Rico and resolved to build an Olympic monster that would never again lose in this event.</p> <p>The US players and coaches had made a big deal about their defense after their two earlier games, boasting about the work that Minnesota Timberwolves coach Tom Thibodeau \u2013 an American assistant coach \u2013 had put in with them in the weeks before the Olympics. Several players said they took defense to be their \u201cidentity\u201d and praised him for forcing them to play with a renewed frenzy. Mike Krzyzewski, the head coach, had boasted that while it may be hard to get a team of great players unaccustomed to working together to learn a half-court offense, they could easily bond by played a frenetic defense.</p> <p>And yet in the first half Australia decimated the American defense. No make that, Australia shredded their defense. Over and over the Australians ran the pick-and-rolls that had carried them through their first two games of the Olympics. Over and over their big men set screens, opening layups for their guards. On a few occasions they were able to pop a their centers free for alley oops.</p> <p>\u201cAustralia has played the best basketball in the Olympics,\u201d said Krzyzewski, who likened the style of play on Wednesday to \u201cdriving in the left (the fast lane in the US) without any speed limit\u201d.</p> <p>The sold out crowd in the small arena stirred. Was it really possible that the mighty US, so loaded with superstars, who were winning their games in slaughters, could actually lose an Olympics game in this seemingly new era of USA basketball? Would it really be this collection of NBA backups and role players who would be the ones to vanquish the indomitable Americans?</p> <p>By halftime the statistics were sobering. Australia had made an eye-popping 70% of their two-point baskets. Just as startling were the 63% of three pointers that had hit, most of them coming from Mills who finished with 30. They built leads of 36-31 and 46-39 before heading into the half up 54-49. It was the first time the Americans had trailed in an Olympic game in 12 years.</p> <p>The only thing that seemed to work in the first half for the US was their outside shooting. Most of these baskets coming from Anthony, the one holdover from those bleak days in the early 2000s when Larry Brown\u2019s name brought scorn and USA basketball vowed to build the right kind of team with coaches who could handle big NBA stars.</p> <p>The US stormed back at the start of the second half to tie the game at 54-54, but this mostly came on a series of missed layups and turnovers by Australia. By the end of the third quarter with the US clutching to a three-point lead that Australia wasn\u2019t going away. It just wasn\u2019t enough, not against a team as deep as the US.</p> <p>\u201cYou prefer to win in blowouts but sometimes it doesn\u2019t work that way,\u201d Thibodeau said after the game. \u201cWe had to fight through it. We have to fight different ways to win games.\u201d</p> <p>Still, who could have imagined the US wold have to scramble to survive?</p>",
