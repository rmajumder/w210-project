  "<p>Efforts to curb global corruption risk being seriously hindered by the UK\u2019s failure to persuade its overseas territories to improve their transparency, a high-level report by British MPs warns today.</p> <p>Accusing the UK government of missing an opportunity to build on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2016/may/12/david-cameron-london-anti-corruption-summit-live\">a major anti-corruption summit</a> that took place in London in May, it calls on Britain to persuade the territories to create public registers of beneficial ownership.</p> <p>A lack of transparency in the entities \u2013 nominally still under the UK\u2019s auspices, but in practice self-ruled and sometimes operating as controversial tax havens \u2013 will continue to damage Britain\u2019s reputation as a leader on anti-corruption, according to the <a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/international-development-committee/\">House of Commons International Development Committee</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a

countries curb tax loss, claim NGOs</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Attempts by Britain\u2019s Department for International Development (DfID) to reduce corruption in developing countries are in danger of being undermined by a lack of policy coherence and the pursuit of different policies by other sections of government, the MPs warn.</p> <p>While commending the UK for showing leadership in the past six years, it adds that the scale of the challenges when it comes to tackling corruption have been underlined by revelations such as those contained in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/series/panama-papers\">Panama Papers</a>, an unprecedented leak of millions of documents showing the myriad ways in which the rich can exploit secretive offshore tax regimes.</p> <p>\u201cIt is essential that momentum is not lost in the wake of the decision to leave the European Union, when laws, regulations and trading arrangements are reviewed,\u201d says the report, which adds that the UK government must consider the ramifications of Brexit on EU provisions designed to curb corruption.</p> <p>As much as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/oct/05/oecd-hopes-reforms-will-end-era-of-aggressive-tax-avoidance\">$240bn (\u00a3195bn) in tax revenue is lost each year</a> due to tax avoidance, according to OECD estimates, with developing countries hit the hardest.</p> <p>The report asks the British government to reconsider whether the best forum for its pursuit of discussions and decisions on international tax matters should actually be the OECD, whose membership is mainly composed of developed countries and which it accused of \u201cnot adequately reflecting the needs of the poorest countries\u201d.</p> <p>The MPs say it is clear from the evidence they received that companies and individuals in the UK as well as in Britain\u2019s crown dependencies and overseas territories \u201cplay a major role in facilitating global corruption\u201d.</p> <p>By way of example, they quote the evidence of Professor Paul Heywood, an anti-corruption expert at the University of Nottingham, who told the committee the role of banks and the City of London \u201cin allowing corrupt money to flow should not be underestimated\u201d.</p> <p>It also notes that approximately half of the companies \u2013 more than 113,000 in total \u2013 that featured in the files released as part of the Panama Papers revelations were registered in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/british-virgin-islands\">the British Virgin Islands, a UK overseas territory.</a></p> <p>In other findings, it says the registration of large numbers of major oil, gas and mining companies in the UK mean that the British government could play an important role in rooting out the corruption that impacted on resource-rich developing states such as Nigeria.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a

level of commitment.<br></p> <p>The report comes after a cross-party group of British MPs <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/06/multinationals-to-publicly-declare-country-by-country-profits-and-tax-caroline-flint\">claimed a victory last week for corporate tax transparency</a> following the government\u2019s acceptance of a legal amendment to legislation that could force multinationals to publicly declare where they do business and the tax they pay.</p> <p>The amendment to the finance bill allows, but does not commit, the government to publication of country-by-country reports produced by multinationals.</p> <p>The committee\u2019s chair, Labour MP Stephen Twigg, says it has previously called on the UK government to get its own house in order, and this remains the case. </p> <p>\u201cMinisters must address the role of some UK companies and individuals in facilitating global corruption, including the vast amounts of money laundered through the UK,\u201d he adds.</p> <p>\u201cHuge amounts of money are lost every year through illegal tax evasion, money laundering and bribery. The people most at risk from this scourge are the world\u2019s poorest, who lose out on education, healthcare and infrastructure \u2013 not to mention the impact of petty corruption on their daily lives.\u201d</p> <p>A spokesperson for DfID said: \u201cThe UK is a global leader in the fight against corruption, and this report rightly recognises the government\u2019s summit in May as a significant moment in international efforts to tackle corruption. </p> <p>\u201cHelping the world\u2019s poorest stand on their own two feet by tackling poverty overseas while stopping organised crime, money laundering and tax evasion is firmly in the UK\u2019s interests. The UK is fully committed to delivering on the promises made at the anti-corruption summit.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>A first world war German submarine, which folklore insists was disabled by a sea monster before the commander and his entire crew surrendered to a British patrol boat without firing a shot, has been rediscovered during survey work for a new power line.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://mysteriousuniverse.org/2015/02/sea-monster-versus-submarine/\">story of UB-85</a> is still being told and re-told on websites focusing on alleged paranormal events, though one historian believes it dates back not to the war but to a club armchair and too much pink gin in the 1920s. \u201cIt has been perpetuated by credulous journalists,\u201d said Innes McCartney, historian and marine archaeologist at Bournemouth University.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a148a3fb1d61dd909e626f047c0b0a9b1c95e08c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a148a3fb1d61dd909e626f047c0b0a9b1c95e08c/0_21_800_480/500.jpg\" alt=\"HMS Coreopsis in 1917\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">HMS Coreopsis in 1917.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Scottish Power</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>According to the yarn, Captain G\u00fcnther Krech explained to his captors on 30 April 1918 that his vessel was cruising on the surface because he could not dive, due to damage caused by \u201ca strange beast\u201d that leaped out of the water. The monster had horns, small deep-set eyes, glinting teeth, and was so heavy that when it scrambled up the side of the U-boat, the whole vessel listed sideways. It then viciously attacked the forward gun, chomping lumps out it. The damage forced the entire crew to surrender to the British patrol: the men were taken off and the submarine scuttled.</p> <p>The wreck was found 104 metres down, off the coast of Stranraer, during survey work on behalf of Scottish Power for <a href=\"http://westernhvdclink.co.uk/\">the Western Link</a>, an underwater cable which, at 239 miles (385km) long, will be the longest of its type in the world. The cable is a \u00a31bn joint-venture with National Grid to take renewable power from Scotland to England.</p> <p>From the murky scans and sonar images, McCartney says the submarine matches the description of UB-85, but could equally be its sister vessel, UB-22. \u201cThis wreck lies roughly halfway between the recorded sites for the two submarines \u2013 but they were virtually indistinguishable apart from the painted letters and numbers, and it seems to me inconceivable that anyone would think it worthwhile to mount a dive to establish which it is.\u201d</p> <p>Sea monster attack stories are surprisingly common, he said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to remember that after the war the records were sealed, but there were all these people with some connection to British intelligence who yearned to boast of mighty deeds at sea but couldn\u2019t tell the true stories. The true sea monsters of the first world war were the submarines themselves.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4f4faf154774b3f466298ae56d95a971f5d4d782\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4f4faf154774b3f466298ae56d95a971f5d4d782/7_0_842_505/500.jpg\" alt=\"Seabed scan image of U-boat wreck found off Scotland\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Seabed scan image of U-boat wreck found off Scotland.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Scottish Power</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>However, Gary Campbell, who keeps the <a href=\"http://www.lochnesssightings.com/\">Official Sightings Record</a> for the Loch Ness Monster \u2013 there have allegedly been six so far in 2016, most recently in August \u2013 prefers to cling to the other explanation, that UB-85 was attacked by a sea monster. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u201cThe area of sea where the attack took place has a history of sea monster sightings \u2013 they have ranged from the north coast of Wales to Liverpool Bay,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat the German captain said could well be true. It\u2019s great to see how Nessie\u2019s saltwater cousin clearly got involved in helping with the war effort \u2013 she even managed to do the damage without anyone being killed.\u201d <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Peter Roper of Scottish Power is less convinced: \u201cI am probably on the side of the historians who believe that the capture of the vessel was more straightforward than a sea monster attack. \u2018A sea monster attacked my submarine\u2019 is maybe one of the most fanciful excuses of all time.

  "<p>Magistrates\u2019 powers should be increased so that they can sentence convicted defendants to up to one year in prison for a single offence, a House of Commons committee has recommended. The report by the justice select committee also calls for clearer government strategy to tackle \u201clow morale\u201d in the service and suggests that companies should be rewarded for allowing employees time off to sit on the bench.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>The number of justices of the peace in England and Wales has declined sharply from 30,000 in 2006 to 17,500 now. Court closures, falling crime rates and a relative increase in the number of full-time district judges have all been blamed for the decline.</p> <p>The government has so far resisted extending the magistracy\u2019s sentencing powers from a maximum of six months to 12 months for a single offence. The authority for it to do so already exists under section 154 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003, but it has never been brought into force.</p> <p>Ministers fear a surge in the prison population through more punitive sentencing, although the Ministry of Justice said it could not provide the committee with any accurate modelling of the effect of the change.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2016/jun/22/fall-in-number-of-magistrates-will-mean-less-diversity\">Fall in number of magistrates 'will mean less diversity'</a> </p> </aside>  <p> \u201cMost of the evidence that we received from magistrates supported the commencement of section 154, a move that would be seen as signalling trust in the magistracy and providing a boost to its morale,\u201d the report declares. The provision would also allow magistrates to hand out sentences of up to 15 months for two or more offences.</p> <p>Preventing many cases from going to the crown court for a more expensive jury trial, it has been claimed, would produce significant savings. </p> <p>Around 53% of magistrates are women and 89% are white. Many benches have no or few members from black, Asian and minority ethnic backgrounds. More than 86% are over the age of 50. \u201cRebalancing the age profile of the magistracy is unlikely to happen unless more is done to overcome the barriers facing employed magistrates,\u201d the report notes. \u201cWe recommend the creation of a kitemark scheme that recognises and rewards employers who support the magistracy.\u201d <br> </p> <p>It also suggests that the MoJ should consider introducing \u201cequal merit\u201d provisions for recruiting magistrates to boost diversity \u2013 which would allow those from less well-represented backgrounds to be chosen if candidates are of otherwise equal merit. <br> </p> <p>The report also heard that some magistrates feel they do not sit often enough, while others felt that case-hardened district judges were able to \u201ccherry-pick\u201d the most interesting cases. <br></p> <p>The Conservative MP Bob Neill, who chairs the committee, said: \u201cIt is unfortunate that the government\u2019s evident goodwill towards the magistracy has not yet been translated into any meaningful strategy for supporting and developing it within a changing criminal justice system. This needs to be addressed as a matter of urgency.</p> <p>\u201cAlthough evidence does not indicate a universal problem, there is sufficient evidence of low morale within the magistracy to cause concern. Magistrates should be consulted on any further changes to the criminal justice system, especially those likely to have an impact on their role.\u201d</p> <p>Commenting on the report, Chris Brace, chief executive of the Magistrates Association, said: \u201cIt\u2019s very encouraging that the committee has accepted our case for 12 months\u2019 sentencing jurisdiction. We now hope that the government will follow suit by enacting dormant legislation.</p> <p> \u201cRetaining these cases in the magistrates\u2019 courts will speed up justice for all court-users, especially victims, enabling magistrates to give more proportionate sentences at the right level. This is a golden opportunity for the government to show how much it trusts the magistracy to deliver justice.\u201d</p> <p>Penelope Gibbs, a former magistrate and director of the campaign group Transform Justice, said: \u201cThis report shows that the magistracy is in crisis. There are 12,000 fewer magistrates now than in 2008. This in itself has led to low morale, but magistrates are also unhappy that the most complex work is sometimes taken by district judges and that changes have been imposed on them. <br></p> <p>\u201cMagistrates themselves have lighted on increased sentencing powers \u2026 as the answer to their problems. It would give magistrates\u2019 courts more work, but it risks increasing prison numbers and decreasing the number of trials heard by juries. The government and the senior judiciary need to halt the downward drift in magistrate numbers and devise a strategy to save the magistracy, not enact one measure which may have perverse effects.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>A bitter debate over identity, religion and tolerance has resumed in the Canadian province of Quebec, as parliamentary hearings begin on proposed legislation that would ban anyone wearing a face covering from receiving public services in the province.<br></p> <p>The bill, tabled by the provincial Liberals last year, aims to address the issue of state neutrality and provide a framework for religious accommodation requests. </p> <p>But much of the public discussion of the bill has focused on its attempt to ban face coverings. The provincial government has said there are no public employees in the province who cover their faces, meaning the legislation is likely directed at Muslim women who wear the niqab or burqa.</p> <p>The government has presented it as an issue of public safety. \u201cWe are not legislating on clothing,\u201d St\u00e9phanie Vall\u00e9e, the province\u2019s justice minister, said last year. \u201cPublic services have to be offered and received with the face uncovered for security, identification and communication purposes.\u201d </p> <p>She has since said she\u2019s not sure how many people in the province have sought out a public service while wearing a face covering. \u201cThere are some, but I don\u2019t have the numbers,\u201d she said. </p> <p>The parliamentary hearings began on Tuesday and will continue until early November. Some 50 groups, from daycares to immigrant support groups, are expected to take part. </p> <p>The bill is the third attempt by authorities in Quebec to legislate secularism in the public domain since 2010. A previous attempt by the Liberals \u2013 which died on the order paper in 2012 \u2013 aimed to address public concerns that could become ripe terrain for some of the province\u2019s opposition parties. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/23/justin-trudeau-rules-out-burkini-ban-in-canada\">Justin Trudeau rules out burkini ban in Canada</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This month, one of these parties, the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois, elected a new leader who has promised to explore a ban on burqas. \u201cThere are security reasons and there are reasons based on equality of men and women,\u201d said leader Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Lis\u00e9e. \u201c[For] reasons that were underlined by 10 European democracies.\u201d</p> <p>In 2013, a Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois government sparked controversy with a proposal to ban public servants ranging from doctors to school janitors from wearing religious symbols such as kippahs, turbans or hijabs. The party was defeated in provincial elections soon after. </p> <p>The Liberal legislation is a watered-down attempt to address the anxieties over accommodation of diversity and public expression of religion that have at times surged to the forefront of Quebec politics, said Jack Jedwab, the president of the Association for Canadian Studies and the Canadian Institute for Identities and Migration. Polling carried out by his organisation last year suggested that 80% of Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois believe the niqab should be banned in government offices and the courts.</p> <p>\u201cThis is the way the Liberals hope they can address this while proposing something they don\u2019t think is a violation of fundamental rights,\u201d he said. Jedwab believed the proposed bill stood a good chance of being passed, barring any kind of legal challenge.</p> <p>While he believed some support for such legislation existed across Canada, he pointed to the province\u2019s close links with France \u2013 where <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/03/france-muslim-women-home-working\">headscarves have been banned in the public service since 2007</a> and a <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/01/france-burqa-ban-upheld-human-rights-court\">ban on face coverings in public places was introduced in 2010</a> \u2013 to explain why popular sentiment towards a religious practice had coalesced into proposed legislation in the province. \u201cThe Francophone population is a much more secular population than is the case anywhere else in North America.\u201d</p> <p>The proposed legislation, however, would still allow a crucifix to sit over the speaker\u2019s chair in Quebec\u2019s National Assembly.<br></p> <p>Some groups have voiced concerns that the legislation will simply serve to stigmatise a small group of women in the province. \u201cIt is very targeted,\u201d said Mihad Fahmy, a lawyer with the National Council of Canadian Muslims. \u201cGiven the body of case law that already exists across the country and even the different human rights codes, one has to wonder why Quebec felt a need to address specifically in a piece of legislation the issue of face coverings.\u201d</p> <p>As the province pushes forward the proposed legislation, the group is bracing itself for ripple effects. \u201cClearly there\u2019s going to be an impact nationwide,\u201d said Fahmy. \u201cIt affects people\u2019s understanding of what\u2019s reasonable and how far we\u2019re willing to go as a pluralistic society in accommodating needs.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>There had been little to advertise the Bayer Leverkusen onslaught. Tottenham Hotspur had not only been comfortable in the first half, they were impressive and, on another night, they would have been in front. Dele Alli was off target with a gilt-edged header while Vincent Janssen sent another one against the crossbar.</p> <p>But this was an occasion when Tottenham\u2019s resilience would endure an exacting test. They passed it and they could yet come to be grateful for the point that kept them above Leverkusen in a congested Champions League Group&#xa0;E, going into the German club\u2019s visit to Wembley in two weeks\u2019 time.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2016/oct/18/bayer-leverkusen-v-tottenham-champions-league-live\">Bayer Leverkusen v Tottenham Hotspur: Champions League \u2013\u00a0live!</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The resistance was symbolised by the goalkeeper and captain, Hugo Lloris, and the save that he made to deny Javier Hern\u00e1ndez, the former Manchester United striker, in the 48th minute was one that needed several replays simply to&#xa0;understand.</p> <p>Hern\u00e1ndez had to score, following Lars Bender\u2019s cross from the right; the range was point-blank and a significant portion of the goal was gaping. But he sent his low shot too close to Lloris and that represented the lifeline. The Frenchman seized it. He showed incredible agility to get down and then strength to clamp the ball with his right hand on to the line. Video technology showed that the whole of the ball had not crossed over.</p> <p>Tottenham were hanging on for much of the second half, as Bayer showed pace and adventure. There were nervous moments in a visiting defence that seemed to miss the authority of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/16/tottenham-optimistic-toby-alderweireld-injury-harry-kane\" title=\"\">the injured Toby Alderweireld</a> and Lloris was required to work again, although not in such spectacular fashion. Mauricio Pochettino\u2019s team rode their luck at times and there was relief when Omer Toprak sent a free header over the bar in the 68th minute. Toprak beat the ground in frustration. But Tottenham could feel some satisfaction upon the full-time whistle and it was telling that Pochettino described it as a \u201cstrong point\u201d.</p> <p>Goalless draws are not supposed to be so watchable and Bayer showed themselves to be formidable opponents when they hit their stride. It was a game in which the margins were knife-edge thin and the right to play had to be earned. Bayer started brightly, with Roger Schmidt having played Stefan Kiessling up alongside Hern\u00e1ndez, but Tottenham came to control the first half.</p> <p>Pochettino could be pleased with the assurance that his players demonstrated in possession before the interval and, on a number of occasions, their interchanges were too sharp for Bayer. They had two moments when they were agonisingly close to taking the lead. Kieran Trippier took Victor Wanyama\u2019s pass and his cross was measured for Alli, who had timed his run into the area. Alli rose but his free header, for which he was stretching slightly, flashed past the post.</p> <p>Janssen had some encouraging moments in the first half and when he teed up Alli on 38 minutes, Toprak blocked the midfielder\u2019s shot. Trippier got to the loose ball and, from his cross, Janssen\u2019s header struck the bar. \u00c9rik Lamela scooped the rebound towards the roof of the net only for Bernd Leno to tip it over.</p> <p>Pochettino had kept faith with Janssen in the centre-forward position, which meant that Son Heung-min played off the flank, initially on the right and then the left. He would later move up front when Janssen was withdrawn.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/18/leicester-city-fc-copenhagen-champions-league-match-report\">Riyad Mahrez volleys Leicester City to narrow win against FC Copenhagen</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It was an emotional night for Son and there were whistles and boos for the former Bayer attacker from the home support, who have not forgotten the acrimonious nature of his departure in August of last year. He missed the club\u2019s Champions League play-off second-leg at home to Lazio because he was in London to undergo his Tottenham medical. Son flickered. He teed up Janssen to stroke the ball into an empty net during the early running but the South Korean had been flagged for offside in the buildup and he had a shot blocked by Benjamin Henrichs on 25 minutes. He was substituted to jeers in the last minute and Pochettino finished with Josh Onomah in the striker\u2019s role.</p> <p>Bayer have been erratic this season and they sit just below halfway in the Bundesliga. They offered little in an attacking sense in the first half \u2013 a Hern\u00e1ndez pot-shot the sum total of their efforts \u2013 but they crackled to life after the break. Admir Mehmedi had the ball in the net only for play to be called back for a foul by Hern\u00e1ndez on Lloris before the goalkeeper distinguished himself with the save from Hernandez that he had no right to make.</p> <p>Schmidt\u2019s half-time introduction of the defensive midfielder, Julian Baumgartlinger, made a difference and it became one-way traffic. Charles Ar\u00e1nguiz worked Lloris with a free-kick; Danny Rose made a vital block to thwart Hern\u00e1ndez; Mehmedi extended Lloris and Toprak headed over from Kevin Kampl\u2019s corner.</p> <p>Not for the first time, Pochettino lamented his team\u2019s lack of clinical edge in front of goal but he recognised Lloris was the decisive factor. \u201cSome brilliance from Hugo kept us in the game,\u201d he said. \u201cHe is one of the best in the world and he is in the best moment of his career.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Half of all American adults are included in databases police use to identify citizens with facial recognition technology, according to new research that raises serious concerns about privacy violations and the widespread use of racially biased surveillance technology.</p> <p>A <a href=\"https://www.perpetuallineup.org/\">report</a> from Georgetown Law\u2019s Center on Privacy and Technology found that more than 117 million adults are captured in a \u201cvirtual, perpetual lineup\u201d, which means law enforcement offices across the US can scan their photos and use unregulated software to track law-abiding citizens in government datasets.</p> <p>Numerous major police departments have \u201creal-time face recognition\u201d technology that allows surveillance cameras to scan the faces of pedestrians walking down the street, the report found. In Maryland, police have been using software to identify faces in protest photos and match them to people with warrants, according to the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU).</p> <p>The report\u2019s findings, along with <a href=\"http://www.aclu-md.org/press_room/290\">revelations</a> from the ACLU on <a href=\"http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/crime/bs-md-geofeedia-update-20161011-story.html\">police monitoring</a> in Baltimore, suggest that the technology may be violating the rights of millions of Americans and is disproportionately affecting communities of color, advocates said.</p> <p>\u201cFace recognition, when it\u2019s used most aggressively, can change the nature of public spaces,\u201d said Alvaro Bedoya, executive director of Georgetown\u2019s privacy and technology center. \u201cIt can change the basic freedom we have to go about our lives without people identifying us from afar and in secret.\u201d</p> <p>The center\u2019s year-long investigation, based on more than 100 police records requests, has produced the most comprehensive survey of facial databases to date and raises numerous questions about the lack of transparency and privacy protections.</p> <p>Law enforcement biometric databases have traditionally captured DNA profiles related to criminal arrests or forensic investigations. What\u2019s alarming about the FBI\u2019s \u201cface recognition unit\u201d, according to the report, is that it is \u201coverwhelmingly made up of non-criminal entries\u201d.</p> <p>The FBI database photos come from state driver\u2019s licenses, passports and visa applications, meaning police can easily identify and monitor people who haven\u2019t had any run-ins with the law.</p> <p>\u201cIn the case of face recognition, there appear to be very few controls or safeguards to ensure it\u2019s not used in situations in which people are engaged in first amendment activity,\u201d said Neema Singh Guliani, ACLU\u2019s legislative counsel.</p> <p>The ACLU recently found that police in Baltimore may have used the recognition technology along with social media accounts to <a href=\"http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/crime/bs-md-geofeedia-update-20161011-story.html\">identify and arrest people</a> with outstanding warrants during high-profile <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/nov/18/baltimore-police-freddie-gray-protests-report-major-shortcomings\">police protests</a> last year.

The firms have since cut off Geofeedia\u2019s special access to their data.<br></p> <p>In addition to concerns about illegal monitoring and the targeting of lawful protesters, research has found that the facial recognition algorithms can be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/apr/08/facial-recognition-technology-racial-bias-police\">biased</a> and <a href=\"http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0139827\">inaccurate</a> \u2013 with serious <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/feb/04/us-police-data-analytics-smart-cities-crime-likelihood-fresno-chicago-heat-list\">consequences for innocent people</a>.</p> <p>\u201cThis technology is powerful, but it is not neutral,\u201d said Bedoya. \u201cThis technology makes mistakes.\u201d</p> <p>The FBI\u2019s own statistics suggest that one out of every seven searches of its facial recognition database fails to turn up a correct match, meaning the software occasionally produces 50 \u201cpotential\u201d matches who are all \u201cinnocent\u201d, the report said.</p> <p>Additionally, a 2012 study co-authored by an FBI expert found that leading facial recognition algorithms were up to 10% less accurate for African Americans compared with white people, the <a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/letter/coalition-letter-department-justice-civil-rights-division-calling-investigation-disparate\">ACLU noted</a>. </p> <p>What\u2019s more, the flawed algorithms can amplify biased policing practices since they rely on mugshot databases that disproportionately represent people of color.</p> <p>For example, the Maricopa County sheriff\u2019s office in Arizona arrests black residents at a rate three times higher than their share of the state population, and a federal judge found that police have <a href=\"http://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/phoenix/2015/02/06/east-valley-police-black-resident-arrest-rates/22924343/\">racially profiled Latinos</a>. </p> <p>Those disparities feed into the databases, and Arizona has no law restricting police use of facial recognition, according to the ACLU. The Maricopa sheriff\u2019s system does not even require an officer to have reasonable suspicion of a crime before searching a face in the database.</p> <p>In Baltimore, some policing strategies have resulted in tens of thousands of arrests for <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/dc-politics/as-mayor-of-baltimore-omalleys-policing-strategy-sowed-mistrust/2015/04/25/af81178a-ea9d-11e4-9767-6276fc9b0ada_story.html\">minor offenses</a>, with prosecutors ultimately dropping the cases. </p> <p>That means many people, the vast <a href=\"http://www.aclu-md.org/press_room/290\">majority</a> of whom are people of color, may remain in facial databases even if they weren\u2019t charged, said David Rocah, senior staff attorney with the ACLU of Maryland.</p> <p>\u201cA great many of those folks ... never should\u2019ve been arrested in the first place and were innocent of any wrongdoing.\u201d </p> <p>Advocates are \u201cplaying catch up\u201d with the technology, which has rolled out across the US with little oversight or restriction, Guliani said. \u201cThat\u2019s really a backwards way to approach it \u2026 This is already being used against communities it\u2019s designed to protect.\u201d</p> <p>Baltimore and Maricopa police officials did not respond to requests for comment.</p> <p>Stephen Moyer, secretary of the Maryland department of public safety and correctional services, which operates the state\u2019s facial recognition database, defended police use of the software, saying in a statement: \u201cMaryland law enforcement agencies make use of all legally available technology to aggressively pursue all criminals.\u201d</p>",

The Premier League? Pah! Leicester City have been there and done that. </strong>Europe\u2019s where it\u2019s at for Claudio Ranieri and co now. Yes, the Champions League has offered Leicester some joy away from domestic troubles. They\u2019ve thumped Brugge and battled to a 1-0 victory over stylish Porto. They\u2019re top of Group G on maximum points. So they should be confident of another positive result tonight against Copenhagen then shouldn\u2019t they? Not quite. The Danish champions have also thrashed Brugge, 4-0, as well as taking a point away from Porto, in Porto. They\u2019re unbeaten all season. Their quality explains why Ranieri rested Riyad Mahrez and Islam Slimani for the 3-0 defeat by Chelsea. \u201cIn the Premier League we must be safe at the end of the year. The Champions League is now,\u201d said Ranieri, explaining that decision. \u201cAt this moment, it\u2019s a priority.\u201d</p> <p><strong>So all of Leicester\u2019s eggs have been placed in one big Champions League basket and tonight feels like an opportunity to justify that decision. </strong>It works in Leicester\u2019s favour that they\u2019re at home. Their newfound inability to defend set pieces appears to be an affliction that only troubles them on the road. They will need to be resilient against a forward line led by the hulking presence of 6ft 4in Andreas Cornelius. Cardiff fans may remember him. He cost them \u00a38m in 2013. He barely played and returned to Copenhagen where he should have stayed given that his career has progressed very nicely since. They also have an all-action captain in Thomas Delaney, who scored a stupendous volley against Brugge and a potent trickster in Kasper Kusk, who Leicester will have to keep an eye on if he starts. </p> <p>Much will be expected of Mahrez and Slimani as they return tonight. And will Jamie Vardy ram Alan Shearer\u2019s criticisms down his throat with a first goal in Europe? Stay tuned to find out.</p> <p><strong>My prediction: Leicester 2-2 Copenhagen</strong></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-10-18T17:35:09.954Z\">at 6.35pm BST</time></p>  </div>",

You fight through it, you work through it, you try to accomplish your goals.\u201d</p> \n<p> Obama said Trump\u2019s attempt to discredit the election process was \u201cbased on no facts\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cEvery expert, regardless of political party, regardless of ideology, conservative or liberal, who has ever examined these issues in a serious way will tell you that instances of significant voter fraud are not to be found.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"eb392f2daff69fdf0baf24fa433f7c14abdb2043\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eb392f2daff69fdf0baf24fa433f7c14abdb2043/0_18_4096_2458/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Early voters in Georgia\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Voters participate in the first day of early voting in the presidential election, in Tucker, Georgia, on Monday.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Erik S Lesser/EPA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Elections are run by state and local officials, he noted, including the battleground state of Florida, which has a Republican governor, and Republican appointees will be running many election sites.</p> \n<p>Trump\u2019s fiery populism and complaints have been condemned as a threat to America\u2019s democratic institutions and for potentially stoking violence. Obama described them as irresponsible and insisted the US would undergo a smooth transition of power in January.</p> \n<p>\u201cAnd so I\u2019d advise Mr Trump to stop whining and go, try to make his case to get votes. And if he got the most votes then it would be my expectation of Hillary Clinton to offer a gracious concession speech and pledge to work with him in order to make sure that the American people benefit from effective government.</p> \n<p>\u201cAnd it would be my job to welcome Mr Trump, regardless of what he\u2019s said about me or my differences with him on my opinions, and escort him over to the Capitol in which there would be a peaceful transfer of power. That\u2019s what Americans do. That\u2019s why America\u2019s already great. One way of weakening America and making it less great is if you start betraying those basic American traditions that have been bipartisan and have helped to hold together this democracy now for well over two centuries.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"a0abf86a-cf7d-402f-a24a-7e2898260047\" data-atom-type=\"explainer\"> \n  <div>\n   <figure class=\"element element-explainer element-atom\" data-display-type=\"flat\"> \n    <h1>How will the election be decided? </h1> \n    <div>\n     <p>The president is chosen through the electoral college, in which each state is assigned a \n      <gu-note title=\"Vicky Frost 22/9/2016 at 12:21\" data-note-edited-by=\"Vicky Frost\" data-note-edited-date=\"2016-09-22T11:21:30.549Z\" data-click-action=\"collapse\" data-note-id=\"80ca109a-7c23-445f-d54c-9ce6f6ccc7e6\" class=\"note note--start note--end\">\n       \u200bcertain \n      </gu-note>\u200bnumber of \n      <gu-note class=\"note note--start note--end\" data-note-edited-by=\"Vicky Frost\" data-note-edited-date=\"2016-09-22T11:18:42.316Z\" data-click-action=\"collapse\" data-note-id=\"b36c395a-1920-42b2-b57b-faa721b9d586\" title=\"Vicky Frost 22/9/2016 at 12:18\">\n       \u200bvotes called \n      </gu-note>\u200belectoral votes&nbsp;(EVs)\n      <gu-note class=\"note note--start note--end\" data-note-edited-by=\"Vicky Frost\" data-note-edited-date=\"2016-09-22T11:13:04.426Z\" data-click-action=\"collapse\" data-note-id=\"a3e31fdb-e028-4a34-e986-31a419d7747e\" title=\"Vicky Frost 22/9/2016 at 12:13\">\n       \u200b.

  "<p>When MPs debate this Thursday whether Sir Philip Green should retain his knighthood, they should recall <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46\" title=\"\">article 172 of the Companies Act 2006</a>. In the event that the provision has slipped anyone\u2019s memory, here&#xa0;comes the refresher. A company director, it says, must \u201chave regard\u201d to \u201cthe likely consequences of any decision in the long term\u201d, \u201cthe interests of \u2026 employees\u201d, \u201csuppliers, customers and others\u201d. Those&#xa0;strictures passed into law in 2006, the&#xa0;year Tony Blair honoured Mr Green for&#xa0;<a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2016/07/22/sir-philip-greens-knighthood-under-review-as-tycoon-braces-for-p/\" title=\"\">services to retail</a>.</p> <p>So how did the high-street tycoon do at BHS? MPs need look no further than the joint report, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/25/bhs-demise-sir-philip-green-reputation-torn-apart-in-damning-report\" title=\"\">published in July</a>, from their colleagues on the work and pensions select committee and the business, innovation and skills committee. It notes that Sir Philip \u201csystematically extracted hundreds of millions of pounds from BHS, paying very little tax and fantastically enriching himself and his family, leaving the company and its pension fund weakened to the point of the inevitable collapse of both\u201d. The result is that 11,000 workers have now lost their jobs and 20,000 pensioners are unclear how they will eke out their retirement.</p> <p>Reading that report, it is impossible to believe that Sir Philip successfully complied with the Companies Act. It is just as hard to believe that one of the most honoured businessmen of modern times deserves his honours. MPs should vote to strip him of his knighthood. The forfeiture committee is already considering such a call from a Labour MP. This amendment has been tabled by a Conservative, Richard Fuller (who was told by Sir Philip to \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2016/jun/15/sir-philip-green-questioned-by-mps-over-bhs-collapse-live-updates?page=with:block-57611755e4b0505cd1bcbe1a\" title=\"\">stop staring</a>\u201d at him during his hearing). It would be apt if MPs of all parties, and especially from the frontbenches, supported it.</p> <p>As surely as vastly expensive night follows day, Sir Philip\u2019s lawyers today <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/18/sir-philip-green-criticises-mps-report-bhs-collapse\" title=\"\">accused MPs of serious errors in their report</a>.

But a parliamentary inquiry is not a judicial one. MPs are entitled to have views. Our honours system is a guide to the values of the country. Britain must not hold up as a model a tax-avoiding, under-investing, get-rich-quick merchant who ran a well-loved business into the ground. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/26/broken-britain-lives-on-in-sports-direct-and-bhs\" title=\"\">Philip Green should no longer be referred to as Sir</a>.

  "<p>Who killed Grantland? It\u2019s a question that sustained a new and seemingly inexhaustible sub-genre of sports media in past year, and was the source of much conjecture and conspiracy theory among hardcore fans of ESPN\u2019s late, much-loved sport and pop culture website when it was shuttered by its financiers in September 2015. </p> <p>The way former Grantlander Bryan Curtis tells it, it was a pretty simple equation: one day the site\u2019s founder and most popular writer Bill Simmons was an employee of ESPN, the next day he wasn\u2019t. Created especially for Simmons by the sports media giant, Grantland was on borrowed time the minute its editor-in-chief was effectively sacked (<a href=\"http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/espn-president-john-skipper-bill-794981\">\u201cIt was business,\u201d said ESPN president John Skipper</a>) after doubling down in <a href=\"http://ftw.usatoday.com/2015/05/bill-simmons-fired-espn-contract-roger-goodell-dan-patrick-liar-video\">his criticism of NFL commissioner Roger Goodell</a>, also commonly known as the media empire\u2019s most important client.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/18/don-lane-and-delayed-telecasts-the-life-of-an-nfl-fan-in-1980s-australia\">Don Lane and delayed telecasts: the life of an NFL fan in 1980s Australia | Ashley Browne</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Media critics would soon feast on Grantland\u2019s abrupt closure, but Curtis learned the website\u2019s fate as he stood in the maternity ward of a hospital celebrating the birth of his daughter Stella. \u201cCheck your email,\u201d read a text from Simmons\u2019 short-lived replacement editor Chis Connelly. \u201cESPN created Grantland for Bill and when Bill no longer worked for ESPN there was no Grantland,\u201d says Curtis, who is in Melbourne for <a href=\"http://www.sportswritersfestival.com.au/\">the Sports Writers Festival</a>. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty much as simple as that.\u201d</p> <p>Still, there\u2019s some irony in the fact that a website whose devotees came to prize the array of distinctive, diverse, and sublimely-talented voices on offer was in the end so obviously tied to the downward trajectory of one man. \u201cIt assumed a larger identity,\u201d Curtis says of the site\u2019s cast of star writers. </p> <p>Before Grantland\u2019s launch in 2011, <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2011/06/bill-simmonss-grantland-is-doomed-even-before-launch/240095/\">there had actually been dire predictions</a> that Simmons would merely curate a kind of journalistic mutual-appreciation society where everybody wrote and thought like him (\u201ca bunch of people doing a Bill impression,\u201d is how Curtis terms it), but his hand-picked staff were encouraged from the outset to pursue subjects and modes of expression that appealed most to them. </p> <p>\u201cBy the end it had its own identity,\u201d says Curtis, who lists Brian Phillips, Katie Baker, David Shoemaker and Shea Serrano as writing talents who flourished and attracted significant followings on the strength of their original approaches to sport and pop culture. \u201cBill uniquely saw that something like this could work. He either directly hired or had a hand in hiring everybody who worked there. So I think that particular, wonderful, magical combination is totally Bill.\u201d</p> <p>Another success of Grantland, Curtis says, was that from the outset its creators had a \u201cno asshole\u201d hiring policy (\u201cI\u2019ve worked at places that have an all-asshole policy,\u201d he laughs), so there were no tortured geniuses or divas in the building, just a hive of creative energy, ambition and positivity.</p> <p>\u201cBill was the ultimate \u2018player\u2019s coach\u2019,\u201d says Curtis. \u201cHe wanted you to succeed on your own terms and find the best version of you. He pushed you to achieve that. The first question we were asked was, \u2018What are you interested in?\u2019 and \u2018What\u2019s the piece you really want to write?\u2019 and then you did that. That doesn\u2019t happen everywhere. Most publications say \u2018What is the piece that we would like you to write that you would most like to write?\u2019</p> <p>\u201cAnd the second question was always, \u2018What form would you like to write it in?\u2019 Oral history? A reported piece? A sort of column that comes out of some strange and previously not accessed part of your brain? It was all at our fingertips. We could deliver it any way we wanted to as long as it was really good.\u201d</p> <p>Perhaps misunderstood by some of its critics, Simmons\u2019 new HBO-funded website, The Ringer, retains much of Grantland\u2019s DNA (former Grantlanders Serrano, Shoemaker, Baker, Juliet Litman, Chris Ryan and editor Sean Fennessey have reunited with their old boss) but it can\u2019t lean on ESPN\u2019s infrastructure in the way Grantland could; there\u2019s no nuts and bolts game recaps, nor straighter, more traditional and news reportage on the site to give writers the same time and creative breathing space. </p> <p>At the Ringer, if a big-time boxing bout finishes late on Saturday night, it is written about immediately, not the following Monday, as was often the case at Grantland. Much of the content is shorter, reacting more quickly to the news cycle. In other words, there are slightly fewer <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://grantland.com/features/sumo-wrestling-tokyo-japan-hakuho-yukio-mishima-novelist-seppuku/\">sprawling Japanese gonzo epics loosely related to sumo wrestling</a>, slightly more instantaneous opinion on topics as varied as Bob Dylan\u2019s Nobel Prize win or Russell Westbrook\u2019s latest fashion travesty, and yet the new site is still home for <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://theringer.com/space-jam-oral-history-michael-jordan-bugs-bunny-493bc91a0b9c#.lkxrorlzq\">fictitious oral histories of Space Jam</a> and deep dives into<a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://theringer.com/the-simpsons-character-who-predicted-silicon-valley-villainy-42dacec839ad#.fl6nts7vc\"> the eerie prescience of Hank Scorpio</a>, a one-episode Simpsons character from 20 years ago.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7cbaa69ebee419a0ec2e3b49dc1565cba80cddcd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7cbaa69ebee419a0ec2e3b49dc1565cba80cddcd/0_42_3960_2376/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bill Simmons and Charles Barkley\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Grantland creator Bill Simmons and NBA great Charles Barkley on the set of Simmons\u2019 new HBO TV show, Any Given Wednesday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jordan Althaus/HBO</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cOne of Bill\u2019s great attributes as an editor is that he\u2019s willing to entertain so many ideas and so many different forms of journalism,\u201d says Curtis. \u201cHe\u2019s not as worried about making something fit a schematic, like a lot of editors are. I\u2019ve never met an editor who is quite like him.\u201d</p> <p>For his signature writing style \u2013 which first came to worldwide attention in the early 2000s and spawned legions of imitators \u2013 Simmons is generally given his dues, as he is for the pioneering BS Report podcasts, which made an art form of the kind of unscripted sport and pop culture talk so often murdered by bad sports radio shows.</p> <p>Yet for all the change he wrought in sportswriting \u2013 and all the writers he\u2019s dragged along in his slipstream through Grantland and his new multimedia ventures \u2013 Simmons-bashing is still a growth industry. There have been some teething problems. HBO are getting neither ratings nor critical plaudits for The Ringer\u2019s accompanying TV project, Any Given Wednesday, which still needs to time to establish itself; breathing space that critics are less inclined than ever to grant such an outsized sports media figure.</p> <p>At the very least, HBO have got themselves an explosive talent and a tastemaker. \u201cHe is inseparable from Grantland and he\u2019s inseparable from The Ringer,\u201d Curtis says. \u201cTo use his political capital to give us a chance to do great stuff and change our careers...it\u2019s really, really amazing to me.\u201d</p> <p>Will such a playground for more leisurely, long-form creativity as Grantland exist again, or was ESPN\u2019s loss-leading boutique site just a hell of a lot of fun while it lasted? Could lightning strike twice? \u201cI hope it does,\u201d says Curtis. </p> <p>He points to the trend for other influential \u201cbrand name\u201d journalists \u2013 Peter King at Sports Illustrated and Yahoo! Sports\u2019 Adrian Wojnarowski are two he he mentions \u2013 going to media companies and asking for their own curated sites as proof it\u2019s the old hands of US sportswriting who are creating openings for new and vibrant voices in the digital age, perhaps unexpectedly so. </p> <p>\u201cYou never would have predicted that Grantland would have existed,\u201d Curtis says. \u201cI think we live in a writer-driven world now rather than a publication-driven world, so the writers are the so-called brands, who can create something like [Grantland].\u201d</p> <p>Still, someone needs to fund it. Putting aside Simmons\u2019 efforts to give a platform to so many new and exciting voices in writing, Grantland couldn\u2019t and wouldn\u2019t have existed without ESPN\u2019s deep reservoirs of cash. \u201cI\u2019m really grateful that ESPN did that,\u201d Curtis admits of the magazine-style deadlines and open vistas Grantland offered. \u201cWhen it was happening it seemed like a dream job. The job was so great that I had a feeling in the pit of my stomach for four years that it would come to an end at some point,\u201d he laughs. \u201cIt was an incredible investment in all senses of the word.\u201d</p> <p>Now, says Curtis, it\u2019s a case of moving on to something original and trying to push the digital format in new directions. \u201cWe want to create something completely different,\u201d he says. \u201cYou can\u2019t do the same thing twice. You can\u2019t recapture things that are gone, no matter how wonderful they were.\u201d </p> <p>Since starting at The Ringer, Curtis himself has branched out into a style of reportage-based podcasting, drawing upon both his reporting and feature-writing skills. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/17/tom-brady-donald-trump-press-conference-distraction\">Tom Brady says he ducked Trump questions to avoid team distractions</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This week he\u2019s surveying the Australian sports media scene with a view to writing one of his signature deep dives, though it\u2019s an item that might sit incongruously alongside posts on Colin Kaepernick and Donald Trump. If the spirit of Grantland lives on, there\u2019s surely no better example than a thorough consideration of Robbo and Caro. What other big-name editor than Bill Simmons would give such esoteric material the green light?</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll look back on it as a magical, fun, creative period,\u201d Curtis says of Grantland. \u201cBut I also think it\u2019s one of the few times in my career where the only impediment to being great was me. A lot of times in journalism we\u2019re held back \u2013 or we think we\u2019re held back \u2013 by the format of the publication, the editor or the time we had to work on something. All the usual excuses. A lot of that was basically thrown out the window [at Grantland] and the only governor of how good we could be was ourselves. That to me was really unique, and the thing I\u2019ll always remember.\u201d</p>",

The album is a strictly local affair: it features his children Charles Berry Jr on guitar and Ingrid Berry on harmonica as well as musicians who have backed him up for more than two decades of shows at <a href=\"http://blueberryhill.com/\">Blueberry Hill</a>, his St Louis club in the city\u2019s Delmar Loop neighborhood. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/oct/18/chuck-berry-new-album-first-in-38-years\">Chuck Berry, 90, announces first album in 38 years</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Across the street from Blueberry Hill is an eight-foot-tall bronze statue of Berry. Indeed, Berry is a towering figure in rock music for his deep catalogue of songs, including Roll Over Beethoven, Maybellene, Rock and Roll Music, Sweet Little Sixteen, Little Queenie, School Days and Johnny B Goode. They served as the shortest bridge between rhythm and blues and rock, the revolutionary new sound embraced by white teenagers in the late 1950s and early 1960s. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kT3kCVFFLNg\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/kT3kCVFFLNg?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Unlike his contemporaries on <a href=\"http://www.history-of-rock.com/chess_records.htm\">Chess Records</a>, the Chicago label that included Muddy Waters, Little Walter and Howlin\u2019 Wolf, Berry wrote songs that articulated the angst of modern teenagers, not the nightlife of adults, which made his songs acceptable for play on white radio stations, where he became a major hitmaker. The songs were a fever dream of sex and cars, the open road and school dances, and carried a jolt of sexual tension. Through defining lyrics like \u201cHail, hail, rock\u2019n\u2019roll / Deliver me from the days of old\u201d, Berry helped a generation of young people communicate an identity separate from their parents. Long before rock became associated with teenage alienation and considered a tool against conformity, Berry was infusing white suburbia with the blues, translated on the sock hop floor as a tight combination of stinging guitar riffs, chugging piano chords, and a stomping beat. </p> <p>The irony, of course, is that the pioneer who helped end racial segregation in music grew up under the weight of <a href=\"http://www.ferris.edu/jimcrow/what.htm\">Jim Crow</a> and was often a target of the system. By the time Berry released Maybellene, his first single, in 1955, he was a 29-year-old who had already served several years in state prison for stealing a car when he was a teenager, even when it was evident he was using a defective gun. The experience forced him to miss graduating high school, despite many years later becoming a chronicler of the experience for others. His popularity among white teenagers made life difficult. After he played a local dance in Meridian, Mississippi, in 1959, a small mob formed after Berry was seen returning a kiss to a white girl. He was jailed for disturbing the peace and was forced to hand over the $700 he made that night to the sheriff. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ROwVrF0Ceg\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6ROwVrF0Ceg?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Berry also fell victim to corruption early in his career. Radio disc jockey <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/aug/05/son-dj-alan-freed-hall-of-fame-no-longer-want-ashes\">Alan Freed</a> demanded he receive a co-writing credit on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvKDr8AgvK8\">Maybellene </a>in exchange for making it a hit. An early manager also failed to give him proper attendance numbers at his live shows, which resulted in diminished returns. The experiences made Berry fiercely skeptical of promoters and record labels for the rest of his life and he developed a touring regimen of demanding cash upfront and only playing with local musicians he met moments before going onstage. </p> <p>Like his contemporary Bo Diddley, Berry defined early rock guitar style, inspired by the precision and force of T-Bone Walker and Charlie Christian. His popularity also transcended the music due to his showmanship. Before Berry, white audiences had rarely seen a guitarist unglue himself from the floor and perform physical acrobatics like hopping on one foot or, in Berry\u2019s case, performing the \u201cduck walk\u201d, his signature move, in which he squatted low to the floor and stalked the stage with one leg hanging in the air.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqS76TFCCYs\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/EqS76TFCCYs?wmode=opaque\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>His success is shared with the piano player <a href=\"http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/keith-richards-remembers-johnnie-johnson-20050415\">Johnnie Johnson</a>, Berry\u2019s longtime collaborator, who hired the guitarist to join his band in 1952. Soon enough, Johnson ceded leadership of the band to Berry and it is Johnson\u2019s bouncing piano that accompanies Berry\u2019s guitar riffs. Berry wrote Johnny B Goode as a tribute to Johnson. However, Johnson long said he was partly responsible for the creation of the songs and, at the suggestion of Keith Richards, Johnson sued Berry to receive royalties in 2000. A federal judge dismissed the suit, saying too much time had passed. Johnson died in 2005.</p> <p>The British Invasion borrowed heavily from Berry\u2019s songbook as the Beatles, the Rolling Stones and many others recorded his songs on their earliest albums. Two years ago, in liner notes to a collection of Berry recordings, Paul McCartney called him \u201cone of the greatest poets America has ever produced\u201d. In inducting Berry into the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame in 1986, Richards admitted he himself \u201clifted every lick [Berry] ever played\u201d.</p> <p>Berry hasn\u2019t released a new album since 1979, when Atco released Rock It. He maintained his residency at the Duck Room in Blueberry Hill until 2014. He has remained largely reclusive, rarely giving interviews or performing high-profile shows. </p> <p>The new record has been in the works for years but word of the sessions, which took place at several studios throughout St Louis, hadn\u2019t traveled far outside the city. At a tribute concert in 2012, Berry hinted new songs were on their way, saying: \u201cAs soon as I can get someone to guide me \u2013 and I do know a little about the business \u2013 I want to push them out.\u201d Finally, they will be released next year. </p>",

Low levels have also been found to adversely impact educational achievement. Earlier this year, a local study conducted by a pediatrician found the incidence of elevated <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/dec/17/flint-polluted-water-toxic-lead-children-at-risk\">blood lead levels for children in the city</a> approximately doubled after its water source was switched.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jun/28/lead-drinking-water-level-nrdc-report-flint-crisis\">Millions exposed to dangerous lead levels in US drinking water, report finds</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The ACLU also said on Tuesday that the suspension/expulsion rate for special education students in Flint was over five times higher than the state average. Special education students in Flint\u2019s school district had a dropout rate 1.6 times higher than the state average, according to the ACLU.</p> <p>Nakiya Wakes is the mother of two children named as plaintiffs in the suit. In March, she told the Guardian her son was suspended <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/24/flint-children-water-crisis-lack-of-data-lead\">more than 50 times</a> in the last school year, a spike that occurred after the city\u2019s water source switched.

Lead-contaminated drinking water disproportionately affects developmentally vulnerable children, according to the lawsuit, as \u201cchildren can absorb 40-50% of an oral dose of water-soluble lead compared with 3-10% for adults\u201d.</p> <p>Public school buildings in the district measured lead levels that ranged from 61 parts per billion to more than 2,800 parts per billion, the ACLU said. Federal law requires remedial action if lead levels exceed 15 parts per billion.</p> <p>\u201cThe rights of schoolchildren and their families are being violated every day in Flint,\u201d said Kary Moss, executive director of the ACLU of Michigan, in a statement. \u201cThis lawsuit exposes what has gone wrong \u2013 including a dysfunctional funding structure \u2013 and demands clear and urgent remedies to make it right.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/04/flint-water-crisis-a-shadow-on-obamas-legacy\">The Flint water crisis is a shadow on Obama's legacy | Marsha Coleman-Adebayo</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The lawsuit names the Michigan department of education, Genesee intermediate school district and the Flint community schools district as defendants. The ACLU said the four-count complaint seeks injunctive relief and several remedies to address developmental disabilities and suspensions.</p> <p>The lawsuit comes just over a year after Michigan\u2019s governor, Rick Snyder, first conceded that Flint\u2019s water supply had been contaminated with lead. Water quality issues in the city emerged shortly after an April 2014 decision by a state-appointed emergency manager to switch Flint\u2019s water source to a highly corrosive river. State environmental officials failed to require Flint to use corrosion controls to treat the water supply, thereby allowing lead to leach off pipes and flow into households across the city.</p> <p>The state and local education departments didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment. The Genesee intermediate school district declined to comment on pending litigation. The lawsuit follows a litany of complaints filed in response to the water crisis, which could carry a financial liability for the state of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/17/thousands-flint-residents-could-join-billion-dollar-water-crisis-lawsuits\">more than $1bn</a>.</p> <p>Multiple investigations into what caused the crisis continue. As part of a probe by Michigan\u2019s attorney general, Bill Schuette, nine state and local officials have been criminally charged for their role in the water crisis. The investigators have said additional individuals are expected to face charges.</p> <p>\u201cThe government\u2019s own actions in exposing the community to elevated lead levels has put every child at risk,\u201d Jessica Levin, staff attorney at the Education Law Center and co-counsel in the case, said in a statement. \u201cNow more than ever, families have the right to expect that the public education system will address their children\u2019s special education needs.\u201d</p>",

As a Vanity Fair piece, The Quiet Tragedy of Melania Trump, concluded <a href=\"http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/10/quiet-tragedy-of-melania-trump\">earlier this week</a>: \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be seen as petty. It should be seen as profoundly sad.\u201d</p> <p>Melania insisted on CNN that she didn\u2019t want our pity, but in the next breath, unwittingly, she elicited it again. Asked what she\u2019d do if her husband, a man whose Twitter account frequently functions as a textbook example of online trolling, ascends to the presidency, she said, without irony, that she\u2019d work to end cyberbullying: \u201cThe social media, it\u2019s very damaging for the children.\u201d</p> <p>Maybe she\u2019s making the brilliantly subtle suggestion she\u2019d undo the model of political bullying her husband stands for. More likely, she\u2019s revealed she lacks even the most rudimentary understanding of his faults.</p>",

The 64 Labour peers who voted with the government included frontbench spokespersons, Lady Hayter and Lord Rosser and the party\u2019s chief whip, Lord Bassam.</p> <p>The vote came just hours after the ruling by the investigatory powers tribunal, the only court to hear complaints against MI5, MI6 and GCHQ, that the security services had until 2015 secretly and illegally collected huge volumes of confidential data of millions of British citizens without adequate or safeguards.<br></p> <p>The Labour peers\u2019 vote also contrasted with a sharp attack on the investigatory powers bill by the shadow home secretary, Diane Abbott, who described it as \u201cdraconian\u201d and said the ruling demonstrated why it needed amending.</p> <p> \u201cThe latest ruling from the investigatory powers tribunal should be a sharp reminder that we should not lightly hand over powers to the security services and police and that greater accountability is needed. The government\u2019s bill needs amending in all these areas,\u201d said Abbott, who has sharpened Labour\u2019s approach to the bill since the party abstained on its Commons second reading.</p> <p>The Lib Dem Lord Paddick said: \u201cLabour\u2019s decision not to back us in opposing this huge intrusion into our privacy shows once and for all that they cannot claim to be the party of civil liberties, regardless of who sits on their benches.</p> <p>\u201cInternet connection records are ill-conceived and disproportionate and no doubt this fight will continue in the courts.\u201d</p> <p>Jim Killock, the Director of the Open Rights Group also strongly criticised the Labour peers. He said: \u201cLabour did not table any serious amendments to this draconian legislation in the House of Lords. Labour is simply failing to hold the government to account.</p> <p>\u201cThe Labour Lords had an opportunity to improve the IP bill and make it closer to becoming a surveillance law fit for a democracy not a dictatorship. They could have called for proposals to record UK citizens\u2019 web browsing history to be scrapped or demanded that the police need independent authorisation to access our data.\u201d</p> <p>But Labour\u2019s leader in the Lords, Angela Smith told the Guardian: \u201cIt\u2019s pretty rich for the Lib Dems to question our peers over this, when a number of their own side also voted against the amendment. It\u2019s also the case that we were voting to protect a concession achieved earlier in the day \u2013 and which follows our general strategy towards the bill, to try and improve it wherever necessary.</p> <p> \u201cThe impressive work of Labour colleagues in the Commons during the report stage there and our own shadow home affairs team in the Lords has contributed significantly to the government\u2019s tabling of over 300 amendments to its own bill \u2013 including on greater safeguards against abuse,\u201d Lady Smith said.</p> <p><strong> \u201c</strong>Appalling as the tribunal ruling is, it is historic and the regimes used to hold and collect data since 2015 have been legal and appropriate. This bill updates and improves the framework used by agencies and the way existing investigatory powers are authorised. It also enables, for the first time, judicial commissioners to veto warrant approvals made by the home secretary.\u201d</p> <p>The peers secured a concession that access to web browsing histories should not be given to the police involved in investigations into offences that carried a prison sentence of less than 12 months. The government had proposed the threshold should be six months.</p>",
  "<p>In the dreamland of English rural life, every Church of England parish church, each with its own vicar, is packed with worshippers come Sunday. The reality is dwindling congregations and sometimes harassed clergy, many of whom have multiple parishes and churches. Church law stipulates that every parish church should have weekly Sunday services, but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/17/church-of-england-could-drop-legal-requirement-weekly-sunday-services\">a new proposal recommends dropping this rule</a>. \u201cIn rural parishes, no vicar can actually get around all their parishes, so technically they\u2019re breaking the law,\u201d said Pete Broadbent, the bishop of Willesden. But how will vicars react?</p> <p>In practice, making such changes may be a formality. \u201cThis law has been universally ignored for decades,\u201d says Michael Hampson, a vicar of four parishes and churches in Lancashire. \u201cAny priest who has more than two parishes, and there are many of us, has not been having a Sunday service in every church for as long as anyone can remember. It\u2019s just the way things are.\u201d Hampson does up to five services on a Sunday \u2013 one at one of his smaller churches, then the weekly service at his large church, then afternoon services and perhaps a christening. \u201cBy juggling various lay ministers and church wardens, we manage to have services on three Sundays every month in the small churches,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Martin Flowerdew serves three parishes in Derbyshire; his smallest church has a congregation of about eight. \u201cIf I were on my own leading worship, I couldn\u2019t get round and do all the legal things you\u2019d expect of me on a Sunday. It\u2019s tidying up the law to sit with the practice and I\u2019m quite relaxed about that.\u201d</p> <p>In the parish of Great Snaith, where Eleanor Robertshaw is rector, there are Sunday services in four out of their five churches every week.\u201cIf we\u2019re wanting to grow churches, then we\u2019ve got to think about [how we] deploy our clergy. It\u2019s not necessarily sensible to have them rushing about, jumping from one service to the next, where they don\u2019t get to speak to people,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Her biggest congregation in one church is about 40; at her smallest, it is five. She says that, even with small numbers, the service \u2013 which doesn\u2019t really differ from one delivered to a larger congregation \u2013 is equally important. \u201cA lot of people don\u2019t drive and can\u2019t get to the church in the next village, but there\u2019s also the personal relationships, the family connections. People hold that very dear to their hearts, certainly in a rural context.\u201d</p> <p>The church\u2019s old approach to its smallest congregations, says Hampson, was all-or-nothing: run a Sunday service or close. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve learned since then is that, actually, there are very good reasons for having two or three services a month or 12 services a year [to celebrate] festivals. That\u2019s now an alternative to closing a church.\u201d</p>",

In July they watched the Four Corners episode on mistreatment of juvenile detainees inside NT correctional facilities, and the boy said: \u201cI know this place.\u201d</p> <p>He said the boy, a \u201cbush kid\u201d with little understanding of city institutions, told him he\u2019d been tied spread-eagled and upright and left for two hours, and that when he once asked an officer for a glass of water, the officer urinated in the toilet and made him drink it.</p> <p>Another time he\u2019d requested a blanket and was given one which \u201csmelled of shit and urine\u201d, the man claimed.</p> <p>Just a few dozen of the 3,000-odd people who live in Maningrida had come to the meeting, with many people away conducting ceremony, at festivals, or attending a funeral. Others, including dozens outside the nearby shop, simply didn\u2019t go. \u201cSomeone should go and close that shop,\u201d said one older woman in frustration.<br></p> <p>An hour before the meeting began, Baru Pascoe walked the streets with a megaphone.</p> <p>\u201cYou gotta remember that Four Corners program,\u201d he shouted. \u201cWhat they did to those boys and girls.

Come on, get up.\u201d</p> <p>Pascoe told Guardian Australia the community were upset by what they saw, and from an apparent lack of action by the Northern Territory government.</p> <p>\u201cTo us, the corrections system, Don Dale, the adult prison, lot of policies have been breached,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Children who were taken from parents by authorities to Darwin lost their culture and struggled to reengage with their community when they returned, Pascoe said.</p> <p>\u201cThese kids have learned white man\u2019s law, white man\u2019s culture. They forget their Aboriginal culture \u2026 and it\u2019s hard for them to catch up.\u201d</p> <p>Inside the meeting <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/oct/12/indigenous-groups-must-be-involved-in-policy-that-affects-them-inquiry-hears\">the recurring demands for greater self determination and community control</a> continued. Let communities do things for themselves, discipline their own kids, and be allowed try community solutions and fail, people said. </p> <p>Some spoke of bringing children back home, and setting up a prison farm where young detainees could serve their sentence out on country, learning culture. Another asked why offenders couldn\u2019t do community service in their communities instead of Darwin.</p> <p>Young people come back from being incarcerated in Darwin and say \u201cI\u2019m a criminal, I\u2019m a smartarse, don\u2019t fuck with me,\u201d Pascoe told the meeting. </p> <p>Women in and outside the meeting spoke more of the violence in town and of children being taken away from their parents by police. They said there needed to be more done to protect women and children, who too often frequented the sole safe house. Gambling and marijuana were problems, and school attendance could also be better, they said. The community\u2019s night patrol needed more support.</p> <p>Helen Williams called for people to stop blaming others and take responsibility. </p> <p>\u201cThings need to change in our community, it\u2019s all us. We\u2019ve got to start waking up,\u201d Williams said.</p> <p>\u201cChildren are getting taken away and of course they are taken away because we make mistakes. It\u2019s important. We\u2019ve got to start from here, our community, our people. Let\u2019s start a good plan, we can\u2019t blame others.\u201d</p> <p>Gooda told the Maningrida meeting he and White would make recommendations and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/oct/15/nt-youth-detention-inquiry-the-key-task-will-be-getting-governments-to-act\">governments would be held accountable,</a> but \u201cthe people who are going to drive the change are community people\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ll make the bullets for you, in those recommendations, but it\u2019s you who\u2019s got to fire them at government and keep them accountable,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cUnless you\u2019re willing to get together as a community, just be prepared to accept what government is going to do to you for the rest of your lives. The only time governments take notice of you is when you all talk with one voice.\u201d</p>",

The answer is not very much. The thing that troubles me is people saying it sets the law back 30 years and it\u2019s a rapists\u2019 charter. That is what is going to make people think they daren\u2019t report what\u2019s happened to them. Those cries of anguish are a self-fulfilling prophesy.\u201d </p> <p> Evans, a Welsh football international, was convicted in 2011 of raping a 19-year-old waitress and spent two-and-a-half years in prison. But following a well-funded campaign that included a \u00a350,000 reward for information leading to his acquittal, his case was quashed on appeal and a retrial ordered.</p> <p>The new evidence came from two former sexual partners of the complainant, who testified that her sexual behaviour with them \u2013 and the language she used \u2013 was similar to Evans\u2019s account of how she had acted with him during consensual sex. </p> <p>At the heart of the appeal <a href=\"http://www.cps.gov.uk/legal/p_to_r/rape_and_sexual_offences/yjcea_1999/\">was section 41 of the of the Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Act 1999</a>, which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/oct/14/campaigners-fear-evans-case-will-stop-women-reporting\">prevents a complainant\u2019s sexual history being used in court apart from in exceptional circumstances</a>. </p> <p>Following Evans\u2019s acquittal on Friday, the women\u2019s rights activist Julie Bindel claimed: <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-3840261/JULIE-BINDEL-committed-anti-rape-campaigner-advise-victims-think-twice-going-court-Ched-Evans-judges-created-RAPISTS-CHARTER.html\">\u201cThe Ched Evans acquittal, and the way his defence was run, has led to a rapists\u2019 charter.\u201d </a></p> <p>Vera Baird, a former solicitor general for England and Wales and now a police and crime commissioner, <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3839546/Ched-Evans-case-set-30-years-says-ex-solicitor-general-jury-told-details-rape-accuser-s-sexual-past.html\">said the decision had put the law back</a> 30 years.</p> <p>FitzGibbon said: \u201cThe law on section 41 makes it very, very difficult to introduce evidence of someone\u2019s previous sexual behaviour unless the judge is persuaded it would result in an unfair verdict if it wasn\u2019t put.<br></p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s an understandable emotional reaction when something like this happens.

But I happen to disagree with her. I don\u2019t think it is. I think the language that she and others have used is counterproductive and is probably more likely to scare people off than the law itself.\u201d</p> <p>Angela Rafferty QC, vice-chair of the Criminal Bar Association and an expert on the law around sexual offences, said: \u201cSometimes cases involving celebrities can be a blessing in highlighting important issues.\u201d </p> <p>But she added: \u201cIt is a disservice to victims of sex offenders to misinform them that the Ched Evans case has put the law back 30 years or has made it a rapists\u2019 charter. That case has not changed the law. The law forbids questions about the previous sexual behaviour of a complainant in sexual offence cases, except in highly unusual circumstances where the trial would be unfair, and a wrongful conviction might result, if the evidence was not given.</p> <p>\u201cThe court of appeal thought Evans\u2019s was such a case. Cases like Evans\u2019s will remain wholly exceptional. There is no relaxation of the rule against this type of questioning.\u201d </p> <p> </p>",

She said any cabinet minister with longstanding opposition to the chosen option <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/oct/18/heathrow-or-gatwick-airport-expansion-to-be-decided-next-week\">will be permitted to dissent publicly on behalf of their constituents</a>, without campaigning against the government or speaking against it in parliament. At Westminster MPs were expecting the key vote on airport expansion to come this autumn, and the news has prompted speculation about why May appears to have postponed the Commons decision. One theory is that she wants to avoid Zac Goldsmith, the Conservative MP, resigning and triggering a byelection in Richmond Park, as he has threatened to do if Heathrow goes ahead. Today the Evening Standard reports that <a href=\"http://www.standard.co.uk/news/transport/tories-in-revolt-over-heathrow-a3372236.html\">local Conservatives would back Goldsmith,</a> as would Tania Mathias, the Tory MP for the neighbouring constituency, Twickenham. </li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong><a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/government-cancels-plans-to-create-a-market-for-secondary-annuities\">The Treasury has cancelled plans to let people sell their pension annuities. </a></strong></li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/oct/18/child-abuse-inquiry-insider-told-home-office-lowell-goddard-concerns-april\">A member of the independent inquiry into child sexual abuse panel has said she went to the Home Office with concerns about the then chair, Dame Lowell Goddard, in April, months before the Home Office said it was aware of the reservations surrounding her.</a></strong></li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/18/parliament-very-likely-to-be-asked-to-agree-brexit-deal\">Parliament is \u201cvery likely\u201d to be asked to ratify any future treaty agreement with the European Union, the high court has been told by lawyers for the government. </a></strong>As<strong> Owen Bowcott</strong> reports, the suggestion that MPs might ultimately be able to exert some control over the final Brexit settlement prompted the pound to surge immediately against the dollar in exchange markets.

Five select committee chairmanships have become vacant and, in line with the Wright reforms introduced in 2010 (named after the then Labour MP Tony Wright, who chaired a committee that recommended them), the posts are filled by MPs voting in a secret ballot. Previously it used to be a whips\u2019 stitch-up. Four of the posts are contested, and nominations have just closed.</p> <p>Two of the committees chairmanships have been allocated to Labour and there is a Jeremy Corbyn effect at work; some particularly experienced candidates are standing who would not normally be standing, because in other circumstances they would be serving on the Labour front bench.</p> <p>The contest that will attract most attention is the one to replace Keith Vaz as chair of the <strong>home affairs committee.</strong> This goes to a Labour MP, and there are four candidates.</p> <p><em>Yvette Cooper, Normanton, Pontefract and Castleford</em></p> <p><em>Caroline Flint, Don Valley</em></p> <p><em>Paul Flynn, Newport West</em></p> <p><em>Chuka Umunna, Streatham</em></p> <p>This will be a fascinating contest. Cooper, a former shadow home secretary, Flint, a former Home Office minister, and Umunna, a former shadow business secretary and a current member of the committee, are all strong, mainstream candidates. Flynn, a career backbencher who briefly held two jobs in Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s shadow cabinet over the summer, is more of a maverick, but he is also passionate about the executive being accountable to parliament.</p> <p>There will also be keen interest in the contest to become chair of the new <strong>Brexit committee</strong>. Again, it has been allocated to Labour and there are just two candidates.</p> <p><em>Hilary Benn, Leeds Central</em></p> <p><em>Kate Hoey, Vauxhall</em></p> <p>Benn is strongly pro-EU, and Hoey is strongly anti, and so it is straight remain/leave fight. Given the fact that most MPs backed remain, and that he is highly respected in the Commons anyway, Benn seems a dead-cert.</p> <p>There are five candidates for the post of <strong>science and technology committee</strong> chair, which goes to a Conservative. They are:</p> <p><em>Victoria Borwick, Kensington</em></p> <p><em>Stephen Metcalfe, South Basildon and East Thurrock</em></p> <p><em>Dr Poulter, Central Suffolk and North Ipswich</em></p> <p><em>Derek Thomas, St Ives</em></p> <p><em>Matt Warman, Boston and Skegness</em></p> <p>And there are just two candidates for the <strong>culture, media and sport committee</strong>, which also goes to a Conservative.</p> <p><em>Damian Collins, Folkestone and Hythe<br></em></p> <p><em>Helen Grant, Maidstone and The Weald</em></p> <p>MPs vote tomorrow and the results will be announced in the afternoon.</p> <p>The fifth committee is the new <strong>international trade</strong> one.

Normally benefits are uprated in line with inflation, but the government has frozen most working-age benefits and tax credits until 2020, which means that higher inflation makes them ever less generous.</p> <p>Here is the key passage from its analysis.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Figure 1 shows how the size of the expected cut in generosity resulting from the four-year cash freeze has increased in the light of upwards revisions to forecast inflation. As of March 2016 the freeze represented a 4% cut in the value of those benefits affected relative to previous plans (given OBR inflation forecasts). As a result, 11.5 million families were expected to lose an average of \u00a3260 a year, saving the government \u00a33.0 billion in 2019\u201320. Given the latest inflation forecasts from the IMF, the policy now represents a 6% cut to affected benefits. The same 11.5 million families are now expected to lose an average of \u00a3360 a year (\u00a3100 a year more than expected in March), saving the government \u00a34.2 billion in 2019\u201320 (i.e. an additional \u00a31.2 billion over what was expected back in March). Greater losses are found among families \u2013 typically those on lower incomes \u2013 who receive more in benefits: for example, ignoring the 3.2 million families who only receive child benefit, the average loss from higher inflation rises to \u00a3140 per year (from \u00a3330 to \u00a3470).</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>Some 11.5m families set to lose an extra \u00a3100 a year from the government\u2019s benefits freeze because of post-Brexit inflation.</strong></li> </ul> <p>And here is the chart quoted in this passage. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"32901b5321d53e9fa5404da41b319ec94bba9aef\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/32901b5321d53e9fa5404da41b319ec94bba9aef/0_15_748_449/500.jpg\" alt=\"Increased losses faced by benefit claimants caused by inflation increases.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Increased losses faced by benefit claimants caused by inflation increases.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: IFS</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The IFS also says that freezing benefits has become \u201csomething of a habit\u201d for the government but that it is bad policy.<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>From the benefit recipient\u2019s perspective, there is a reason that benefits are uprated in line with prices by default \u2013 since one purpose of benefits is to provide a minimum standard of living, their level should reflect the cost of purchasing the goods and services required to provide that minimum standard. While it is perfectly reasonable to argue \u2013 as the 2015 Conservative Party manifesto did \u2013 that the working age benefit system should be made less generous over this parliament, it is hard to see why the appropriate size of cut should be arbitrarily determined by the impact of movements in sterling on prices.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58060d96e4b055209adaec27\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-18T11:56:50.016Z\">12.56pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here is my colleague Jessica Elgot\u2019s story on the airports announcement.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/oct/18/heathrow-or-gatwick-airport-expansion-to-be-decided-next-week\">Heathrow or Gatwick: airport expansion to be decided next week</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58060b5fe4b055209adaec14\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-18T11:54:34.394Z\">12.54pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Number 10\u2019s decision to announce that it will be suspending collective responsibility over the airport expansion decision is being taken in the lobby as Downing Street all but admitting that the government will decide to go ahead with the third runway.</p> <p>This is from the Evening Standard\u2019s<strong> Pippa Crerar.</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/PippaCrerar/status/788343707699478528\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/PippaCrerar\">@PippaCrerar</a> .... which is strongest hint yet that Heathrow runway will get green light.

In particular, fiscal cuts in the context of the recent UK austerity programme are strongly associated with a higher Vote Leave share. We also produce evidence that lower-quality service provision in the National Health Service is associated with the success of Vote Leave ...</p> <p>Our regressions allow for a counterfactual analysis. We find that relatively modest reductions in fiscal cuts at the local authority level (less than \u00a350 per person) may have been sufficient to lead to the opposite referendum outcome, pushing the Vote Leave share below 50 percent. The overall reductions in fiscal cuts would have amounted to less than \u00a33 billion in total for the UK. In contrast, even major changes to immigration from Eastern Europe would have been very unlikely to sway the vote in any meaningful way. </p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>They claim that immigration from Eastern Europe increased the leave vote, but not immigration from other EU countries or from outside the EU.</strong> But they say reducing immigration from Eastern Europe may not have affected the result.</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>A reduction in migration from Eastern Europe, which could have been achieved by opting to phase in freedom of movement in 2004 (which much of the rest of Europe did), could have also reduced the margin of victory for the Leave campaign, but would have been unlikely to overturn the referendum result ...</p> <p>We also find strong evidence that the growth rate of migrants from the 12 EU accession countries that joined the EU in 2004 and 2007 is tightly linked to the Vote Leave share. This stands in contrast to migrant growth from the EU 15 countries or elsewhere in the world. We therefore conclude that migration from predominantly Eastern European countries has had a distinct effect on voters. However, we cannot identify the precise mechanism \u2013 whether the effect on voters is mainly economic through competition in the labour and housing markets, or rather in terms of changing social conditions. </p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>They say that the UK\u2019s first-past-the-post electoral system contributed to leave winning.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Anti-EU parties, in particular the UK Independence Party (Ukip), have seen strong popular support in European parliament elections that are based on proportional representation. However, despite significant popular support for Ukip, the party is essentially not represented in the national parliament, implying that a significant share of voters lack formal access to the political system through representation of their views. At the same time, the strong popular support has rightfully attracted media attention. But it has come with no obligation for far-right politicians to assume roles of responsibility towards their electorate by exercising executive power ...</p> <p>We argue that the \u2018Westminster bubble\u2019 is key to understanding the voting outcome. The under-representation of anti-EU parties in the British parliament is likely a crucial contributing factor to the lack of attention paid in the political process to struggling areas, especially in England and Wales. As a result of the first-past-the-post voting system, Ukip currently only has one member of parliament in the House of Commons out of over 600, despite the fact that Ukip came first in the most recent European Parliament elections. Ukip representatives are therefore hardly in positions of political responsibility and thus largely escape media scrutiny. It may therefore be appropriate to consider ways of introducing more proportional representation into British politics. </p> </blockquote> <p>But, remember, just because something gets published by academics, that does not mean it is necessarily correct. <strong>Chris Hanretty</strong>, a politics lecturer and elections expert, has published <a href=\"https://medium.com/@chrishanretty/did-austerity-cause-brexit-7051e691f0ab#.siqz2hxow\">a critique of the paper</a> arguing that the Warwick authors have confused correlation with causation.

Here is an extract.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I am not an economist but I have come to the conclusion that central banks collectively have now indeed lost the plot.

Yet in reality they are blowing up a bubble of make-believe money to avoid immediate pain, except for penalising the poor and the prudent ...</p> <p>Some central bankers would mount a strong defence of their approach. They would explain that there is a global glut of savings, so interest rates are in any case kept low by market forces.

They are capable of doing damage, even in a compromised state.\u201d</p> <p>The state\u2019s position has been backed by hunters who say they are helping maintain a balanced ecosystem. But anti-hunt activists are outraged and have found some support politically, with state representative Raymond Lesniak, a Democrat, <a href=\"http://www.njleg.state.nj.us/2016/Bills/S3000/2702_I1.PDF\">putting forward a bill </a>that would ban bear hunting for five years while non-lethal alternatives are explored. </p> <p>This legislation has little chance of success given the support Chris Christie, the New Jersey governor and erstwhile presidential candidate, has given bear hunting.</p> <p>\u201cThis is definitely Christie\u2019s bear hunt,\u201d said Metler. \u201cThree previous governors saw through the malarkey of this bear hunting.

But as I say, the view within government is that it is very likely that this treaty will be subject to ratification process in the usual way. Most of them are.

  "<p>There is a ferocious battle going on among individuals who have dedicated their professional lives to protecting children. On one side are well-performing children\u2019s services departments, which believe the law can be an impediment to more effective and efficient ways of working.

Underlying at least part of the enthusiasm for the potential freedoms contained in the bill seems to be immense frustration that child protection social work is minutely scrutinised by Ofsted and then savagely blamed in public when something goes wrong. The latter scenario typically leads to more legislation, and tighter prescription of what a social worker should do, how it should be done, and by when.</p> <p>\u201cI do think there\u2019s a debate to be had about whether we aren\u2019t massively over-regulated and over-checked in terms of our practice,\u201d says Dave Hill, president of the Association of Directors of Children\u2019s Services. \u201cThere\u2019s an underlying issue of trusting professionals to do the best thing for children.

  "<p>Serious concerns about the leadership of the chair of the national child abuse inquiry were taken to the top of the Home Office under Theresa May months before officials claimed they were aware of any reservations.</p> <p>It also emerged on Tuesday that relations between the leading panel members on the \u00a3100m inquiry and its chair, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/jul/09/child-abuse-inquiry\" draggable=\"true\">Dame Lowell Goddard</a> \u2013 who was appointed by May in 2015 \u2013 were so bad that a professional facilitator was recruited to try to aid communications between them.</p> <p>May\u2019s knowledge of the worries held by panel members about the leadership of the New Zealand judge she appointed came under intense scrutiny by MPs on the home affairs select committee on Tuesday.</p> <p>Dru Sharpling, a panel member, told the committee that she <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/oct/14/dame-lowell-goddard-child-abuse-inquiry-racism-claims-totally-false\">raised concerns about Goddard\u2019s leadership</a> with the director general of the Home Office in April this year \u2013 nine months after the panel began their work with Goddard. At the time, May \u2013 who set up the inquiry and as prime minister maintains a strong personal interest in it \u2013 was running the Home Office.</p> <p>But one of her officials \u2013 Mark Sedwill, permanent secretary to the Home Office \u2013 repeatedly denied that he or May were made aware of the Sharpling meeting with the Home Office official.</p> <p>He maintained that the first the Home Office knew of problems about the leadership of Goddard and the worsening relationship between the chair and her panel was on 29 July this year. Six days later, Goddard resigned, leaving the inquiry without a chair for the third time since it began in July 2014.</p> <p>Labour MP David Winnick accused Sedwill and the home secretary, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/amber-rudd\" draggable=\"true\">Amber Rudd</a>, of \u201cshabbily misleading\u201d the committee last month when giving evidence about Goddard\u2019s departure. Rudd told MPs that Goddard had quit because she was a long way from home and was lonely. She made no mention of the Home Office being made aware of the panel\u2019s concerns about the New Zealand judge in April this year.</p> <p>Sedwill said the home secretary had been responding to questions about Goddard\u2019s motivation for leaving, and had not been aware of earlier concerns raised with officials. Neither he nor the then home secretary May had been made aware of Sharpling\u2019s meeting with the director general, he said.</p> <p>In an at times defensive performance before MPs, the panel members said they were determined to carry out the remit of the inquiry and come up with robust recommendations to prevent children being abused within institutions in the future.</p> <p>Sharpling, responding to questions about the departure of Goddard, revealed that she had informed Mary Calam, the Home Office director general for the crime and policing group, on 26 April about the concerns with Goddard\u2019s leadership.</p> <p>Responding to allegations reported in the media that Goddard was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/oct/14/lowell-goddard-child-abuse-inquiry-judge-denies-racism-claims\" draggable=\"true\">racist and abusive to staff</a> on the inquiry, Sharpling said: \u201cI am not going to engage in the sort of character issues that have been published across the papers. It seems to me to be entirely inappropriate.

These departures have included that of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/sep/28/ben-emmerson-counsel-child-sexual-abuse-inquiry-sacked-concerns-over-leadership\">lead counsel Ben Emmerson QC</a>.</p> <p>Jay said the inquiry had never been in crisis. \u201cThis inquiry has always been bigger than any single person,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Frank revealed that the challenges in the relationship between the panel and Goddard were so great that a professional facilitator was hired in an attempt to improve the relationship.</p> <p>The panel members insisted that the turbulence had not impacted on the work of the inquiry and that there had been achievements, including the gathering of evidence in private from 200 individuals via the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/10/justice-goddard-resignation-child-sexual-abuse-inquiry\" draggable=\"true\">\u201ctruth project\u201d</a>.</p> <p>Despite criticism of her lack of legal expertise and background as a social worker, Jay said she believed she had the support of many victims and survivor groups, though she acknowledged that many were unhappy at her appointment.</p> <p>Jay said she had never in her life been accused of tolerating bullying or offensive behaviour but could not comment on the allegations in the press against Goddard.</p> <p>In correspondence published by the inquiry, Tim Loughton, the acting chair, made clear to Goddard that if she did not agree to give further evidence to the inquiry, either in person or via video link, she may be open to parliamentary censure.</p> <p>Loughton told the New Zealand judge in a letter dated 14 October: \u201cI would just add that committee members have asked me to make clear that, if you are unwilling to comply with this further request to cooperate with our formal scrutiny role as a parliamentary select committee by giving oral evidence, we may well feel it necessary to draw this refusal to parliament\u2019s attention in any report we produce on the recent events affecting the independent inquiry.

Militarily, Isis is losing. But progress on giving Sunnis in Mosul reasons to believe in their future and to support the country\u2019s Shia-dominated government remains elusive. And this is the key battleground: without victory here, we will be locked into a cycle of violence without end.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/14/last-battle-against-isis-in-iraq-forces-mass-for-mosul-assault\">'Last battle' against Isis in Iraq: forces mass for Mosul assault</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Isis\u2019s initial triumphs were built on the acquiescence of a Sunni population that saw no incentive to side with the Shia-dominated government in Baghdad. Unless and until this motivation changes, the military defeat of the Isis caliphate within Iraq will mutate into a simmering sectarian conflict that will usher in the next mutation of Wahhabi extremism. Improvised explosive devices (IEDs) and suicide bombers will proliferate across Iraq, hampering reconstruction and governance and perpetuating the cycle of grievance.</p> <p>Peace in Iraq will demand the backing of all its peoples \u2013 something that is currently lacking. If the terrain continues to be contested, humanitarian organisations will not have the access or the neutrality they require to do their work.</p> <p>Even activities that are essential to allowing internally displaced people to return home, such as the clearance of explosive hazards, will be difficult if many locals continue to support the militants after they have melted into the population.</p> <p>Winning the peace will also demand long-term attention from the international community. The media-grabbing immediacy of the battle with Isis may draw attention and funding away from liberated areas where it is needed if lasting peace is to be established. Iraq\u2019s social fabric is crumbling; even in places such as Basra, the oil-rich port in the Shia south of Iraq, untouched by Isis, belief in the government and the future is diminishing, the social contract is breaking down.</p> <p>And it is not just in Iraq that the social order is collapsing; on the international scene, the rules-based system clings on more because of the absence of any desirable alternative than because of any continued credibility. The real rules of the game would seem to be encapsulated by that realpolitik phrase, \u201cfacts on the ground\u201d. I first came across this in discussion of Israeli policy towards the West Bank (particularly its settlements, built in contravention of international law). It is also apt for the Russian annexation of Crimea and China\u2019s attitude to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/13/china-damns-international-court-after-south-china-sea-slapdown\" title=\"\">nine-dash map</a> and the South China Sea.</p> <p>As Henry Kissinger observed many years ago, \u201cpolitical statement without military capability is empty posturing\u201d. European peace dividends at the end of the cold war, and in Britain after Afghanistan, have led to a reliance on soft power tools to promote agreements without the means to enforce them if they are violated. Moreover, since 9/11 the west has often yielded the moral high ground in the interest of expediency. We are left with the vexing inefficiencies of a liberal democracy without the stark moral differentiation between liberal democracies and their foes that was taken for granted through the cold war.</p> <p>This has not gone unnoticed elsewhere in the world, where the belief that might makes right is on the rise. Which brings us back to the battle for Mosul. For although the media depicts the battle in Manichean terms, a battle between the coalition (good) and Isis (bad), the reality on the ground is more ambiguous and its refractions through various narratives even more so.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/15/mosul-civilians-brace-assault-iraq-retake-isis-stronghold\">Mosul civilians brace for assault as Iraq forces bid to retake Isis stronghold</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The political end state of Iraq (and Syria) is still up for grabs. The battle for Mosul represents a chance for the key players to create the \u201cfacts on the ground\u201d that others will find hard to dislodge. The Kurds are currently the US allies and strike force of choice; yet they have no assurance of the independent political status they crave. The Turks have forces near Mosul already, under the pretext of protecting civilians from Isis, and have Sunni militia acting on their behalf; their goal is the restoration of the Ottoman vilayet of Mosul as part of a greater Turkey. And even the Washington elite seems divided between those focused on Isis and open to a deal with Russia (Barack Obama, John Kerry, the state department), those intent on raising \u201cmoderate\u201d opposition (the Pentagon), and those in favour of regime change (the CIA). Resolving these competing motivations is the essential precursor to allowing whatever government results in Mosul to start the lengthy business of creating the trust that is the essential basis of peace.</p> <p>The military defeat of Isis in Mosul will not end the conflict, it will change it. For as with the conflict in Syria, the motivation of external players would seem set to perpetuate the humanitarian horrors for the people of Iraq.</p> <p>Isis\u2019s so-called caliphate can be defeated militarily. Isis as an ideology can only be buried by a counter-narrative from within the Sunni, indeed within the Wahhabi, religious community. Isis as a Trumpesque, violent rejection of a (literally) hopeless status quo needs to be countered by a positive, credible and deliverable alternative vision of the future, one that resonates with Sunnis\u2019 values and their actual experience.</p>",

Rather than drawing a line under bad practice and forging a new era of transparent, clearly avowed and properly authorised and regulated surveillance, the bill is so byzantine and complex that it could lead to another 17 years of creative interpretation of the rules. This ruling should be a warning to all of us that when we give the government an inch, it will take a mile.</p> <p>Let us be clear about what it has done when it says it has been collecting \u201cbulk communications data\u201d. Rather than seek the creation of transparent and democratically approved laws, it instead spent 17 years using an archaic, obscure, vague clause from a pre-internet piece of legislation \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1984/12/section/94\" title=\"\">section 94 of the Telecommunications Act 1984</a> \u2013 to obtain regular feeds of bulk communications data from telecommunications companies.</p> <p>In short, the government has been collecting your personal data from your phone and email provider \u2013 who you\u2019ve been communicating with, when you communicated with them, where you were at the time. This data provides a detailed picture of who you are, your friendships and family relationships, your interests and movements, including your political views, your sexuality and who knows what else. And the government has been taking it all in for over a decade. Without you knowing about it. Without even parliament knowing about it.</p> <p>The first official, independent review of these section 94 directions <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2016/jul/07/fifteen-secret-warrants-in-force-granting-bulk-data-collection-in-the-uk\" title=\"\">came out only in July this year</a>. Sir Stanley Burnton, the interception of communications commissioner, who conducted <a href=\"http://www.iocco-uk.info/docs/56208%20HC33%20WEB.pdf\" title=\"\">the review</a>, commented somewhat understatedly that there were \u201cdifficulties when statutes are operated in secret and where there is a lack of statutory codified procedures\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cDifficulties\u201d is one way to put it. The potential for abuse, misuse and skirting the rule of law is another. What we have seen emerge from disclosed documents is that the cloak of secrecy resulted in massive troves of our personal data becoming a kind of Facebook for spies. Staff had to be repeatedly warned not to search for or access information about other members of staff, neighbours, friends, acquaintances, family members and public figures.</p> <p>Other independent experts have revealed further abuses. David Anderson QC, the independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, noted at <a href=\"https://terrorismlegislationreviewer.independent.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Bulk-Powers-Review-final-report.pdf\" title=\"\">para 5.42</a> of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/19/bulk-data-collection-vital-to-prevent-terrorism-in-uk-report-finds\" title=\"\">his review of bulk powers</a> that a \u201cvery serious incident\u201d took place in 2014.

With no provisions for notification, we will never know if our data was misused, however egregious the incident. The investigatory powers bill takes a tiny step in the right direction by allowing for error reporting in limited, discretionary circumstances. But that is not nearly enough. Error reporting should be mandatory to give us effective rights to seek redress.</p> <p>Of even greater concern than abuse, however, is the threat to a democratic society created when we normalise that idea of putting us all under surveillance. But neither the government nor parliament has fully confronted the main consequence of the bill, which enshrines in law the powers of bulk surveillance that led to the collection of all our data. Parliament has been hobbled by the many layers of this enormous, complex mostly unfathomable piece of legislation, accompanied by hundreds of pages of equally opaque codes of practice. It is true that we have moved on from an era of a vacuum in law. But what we have got instead is a new era of legal labyrinthian complexity.</p> <p>So, with the investigatory powers bill just weeks from becoming law, we find ourselves at the precipice of the post-Snowden surveillance settlement. Rather than rolling back the mass surveillance practices that have been exposed in the aftermath of Edward Snowden blowing the whistle, some of which Monday\u2019s judgment finally found to be unlawful, May\u2019s bill is hurtling forward like a freight train. If it fails to change course, we may again find ourselves in court challenging the state\u2019s mass surveillance practices. While it is the 11th hour, it is not too late for parliament to stop this vicious cycle of unlawfulness that thrives on rules that no one understands.</p>",

A slide show unnervingly reveals <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZrPbEi4A0c\">Karah Son</a>\u2019s Butterfly as already taken.</p> <p>The first intimation of catastrophe comes when she arrives with her family, suitcase in hand, ready to start a new life, unlike the other girls, who pitch up alone, casual and knowing.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"37a5a58f6b32117fe1a2505343acbc145abfc21d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/37a5a58f6b32117fe1a2505343acbc145abfc21d/0_262_5244_3148/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Men pick out women from catalogues\u2019.Karah Son as Cio-Cio San and Matteo Lippi as Lieutenant Pinkerton in Glyndebourne Touring Opera\u2019s Madama Butterfly.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Men pick out women from catalogues\u2019 \u2026 Karah Son as Cio-Cio San and Matteo Lippi as Lieutenant Pinkerton in Madama Butterfly.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Yet in forcefully underscoring points, Miskimmon is in danger of cramping her own style. We are still in the marriage bureau for the act-one love duet, during which Butterfly and Pinkerton watch a documentary about GI brides \u2013 she is hopefully fascinated, he uncomfortable \u2013 while Goro (Alun Rhys-Jenkins) counts up the cash. The scene is oddly chilly and too divergent from the passion in the score.</p> <p>The second half is more balanced. Butterfly persists in wearing the two-piece suit that Pinkerton gave her as a present, and drapes their son in one of his father\u2019s cast-off navy jackets to present him to Francesco Verna\u2019s Sharpless. Kate (Marta Fontanals-Simmons), Pinkerton\u2019s \u201creal American wife\u201d is a glacial <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PTnDtsqwLU\">Tippi Hedren</a> lookalike, who arrives with a swanky battleship toy for the boy she is unfeelingly about to adopt. The ending disturbs, leaving us wondering what the long-term consequences might be for her son of Butterfly\u2019s suicide in his presence.</p> <p>The inequalities, however, are not just theatrical. Vocally, this is variable, with the men better than the women. Son has an appealing voice that can thrill at full throttle, but could do with more variety of colour and verbal subtlety. Claudia Huckle as her maid Suzuki is affecting if at times overly reined-in. She and Son sound good together in the Flower Duet.</p> <p> Lippi, though, makes a marvellous Pinkerton, with his bronze tone and ardent phrasing: he\u2019s curiously sympathetic, too, as genuine remorse takes over at the end. Verna\u2019s Sharpless, meanwhile, is beautifully sung, and carefully characterised as a reticent, stiff-backed bureaucrat increasingly adrift in an emotional situation over which he has no control.

  "<p>Two weeks ago <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/05/mays-conservative-party-conference-speech-key-points-analysed\">Theresa May made a statement</a> that, for many, trampled on 200 years of enlightenment and cosmopolitan thinking: \u201cIf you are a citizen of the world, you are a citizen of nowhere\u201d.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>It was a proclamation blasted by figures from all sides, but for Kwame Anthony Appiah, the philosopher who on Tuesday gave the first of this year\u2019s prestigious BBC Reith lectures, the sentiment stung. His life \u2013 he is the son of a British aristocratic mother and Ghanian anti-colonial activist father, raised as a strict Christian in Kumasi, then sent to British boarding school, followed by a move to the US in the 1970s; he is gay, married to a Jewish man and explores identity for a living \u2013 meant May\u2019s comments were both \u201cinsulting and nonsense in every conceivable way\u201d. </p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s just an error of history to say, if you\u2019re a nationalist, you can\u2019t be a citizen of the world,\u201d says Appiah bluntly. </p> <p>Yet, the prime minister\u2019s words were timely. They were an example of what Appiah considers to be grave misunderstandings around identity; in particular how we see race, nationality and religion as being central to who we are.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/oct/30/simon-blackburn-honor-code-review\">The Honor Code: How Moral Revolutions Happen by Kwame Anthony Appiah - review</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Regarded as one of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/oct/30/simon-blackburn-honor-code-review\">world\u2019s greatest thinkers</a> on African and African American cultural studies, Appiah has taught at Yale, Harvard, Princeton and now NYU. He follows in the notable footsteps of previous Reith lecturers Stephen Hawking, Aung San Su Kyi, Richard Rodgers, Grayson Perry and Robert Oppenheimer.</p> <p> The \u201cMistaken Identities\u201d lectures cover ground already well trodden by the philosopher. His mixed race background, lapsed religious beliefs and even sexual orientation have, in his own words, put him on the \u201cperiphery of every accepted identity\u201d.</p> <p>But in the face of religious fundamentalism, Brexit and the need to reiterate in parts of the US that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/gallery/2016/jul/10/black-lives-matter-protests-across-the-us-in-pictures\">black lives matter</a>, Appiah argues it is time we stopped making dangerous assumptions about how we define ourselves and each other. </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/oct/15/this-weeks-best-radio-reith-lectures-incredible-women\">Appiah\u2019s lecture</a> on nationality draws heavily on the \u201cnonsense misconceptions\u201d he saw emerge prominently in the Brexit and Donald Trump campaigns \u2013 that to preserve our national identity we have to oppose globalisation.</p> <p>\u201cMy father went to prison three times as a political prisoner, was nearly shot once, served in parliament, represented his country at the United Nations and believed that he should die for his country,\u201d Appiah says. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t a more patriotic man than my father, and this Ghanaian patriot was the person who explicitly taught me that I was a citizen of the world. In fact, it mattered so much to him that he wrote it in a letter for us when he died.<br></p> <p> \u201cSo I know from deep experience that nationalism and globalisation go hand in hand and are not, as Theresa May has said, opposing projects. It just doesn\u2019t make sense.\u201d</p> <p>The inconsistency towards national sovereignty irritates Appiah. He points out how the importance of a person\u2019s right in the UK to \u201csettle their own destiny\u201d, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/feb/21/boris-johnson-eu-referendum-campaign-for-brexit-david-cameron\">as Boris Johnson put it</a>, took centre stage during the Brexit campaign, but a year earlier \u201cthat same right had been denied to the Scottish people\u201d.</p> <p> \u201cWhether it\u2019s these current stories of essential Britishness, stories of times of essential Hinduness in India, or tales of a pure Islamic state, they are all profoundly unfaithful to historic fact,\u201d he says. \u201cNationality, religion, both have always been fluid and evolving, that\u2019s how they have survived.\u201d </p> <p>And when it comes to self identity, Appiah argues, race is just as misunderstood as nationality \u2013 with disastrous consequences. <br></p> <p>Society still largely operates under the misapprehension that race (largely defined by skin colour) has some basis in biology. There is a perpetuating idea that black-skinned or white-skinned people across the world share a similar set of genes that set the two races apart, even across continents. In short, it\u2019s what Appiah calls \u201ctotal twaddle\u201d. </p> <p>\u201cThe way that we talk about race today is just incoherent,\u201d he says. \u201cThe thing about race is that it is a form of identity that is meant to apply across the world, everybody is supposed to have one \u2013 you\u2019re black or you\u2019re white or you\u2019re Asian \u2013 and it\u2019s supposed to be significant for you, whoever and wherever you are. But biologically that\u2019s nonsense.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s not new information, but for Appiah it is essential to voice it. Despite growing up mixed-race and gay in Ghana, then moving to the UK aged 11, Appiah says these supposedly conflicting aspects of his identity were never a problem for him until he moved to the US. As a student at Yale in his early 20s, others began to define him entirely by his race, and even questioned whether having a white mother made him \u201creally black\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIf you try to say what the whiteness of a white person or the blackness of a black person actually means in scientific terms, there\u2019s almost nothing you can say that is true or even remotely plausible. Yet socially, we use these things all the time as if there\u2019s a solidity to them.\u201d</p> <p>Appiah is at pains to point out that, while society has made race and colour a significant part of how we identify ourselves, particularly in places such as the UK and US, it is an invented idea to which we cling irrationally. <br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/aug/26/highereducation.news3\">Review: Cosmopolitanism by Kwame Anthony Appiah</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Appiah\u2019s lecture explores the notion that two black-skinned people may share similar genes for skin colour, but a white-skinned person and a black-skinned person may share a similar gene that makes them brilliant at playing the piano. So why, he asks, have we decided that one is the core of our identity and the other is a lesser trait?</p> <p>\u201cHow race works is actually pretty local and specific; what it means to be black in New York is completely different from what it means to be black in Accra, or even in London,\u201d he explains. \u201cAnd yet people believe it means roughly the same thing everywhere. Race does nothing for us.</p> <p>\u201cI do think that in the long run if everybody grasped the facts about the relevant biology and the social facts, they\u2019d have to treat race in a different way and stop using it to define each,\u201d he says. </p> <p>At a time when the world continues to divide itself along racial lines and where, in the US, \u201cbeing put in that black box means you tend to get treated worse and are more likely to get shot by a police officer\u201d, getting people to understand race as a social invention could, in Appiah\u2019s view, save lives.</p> <p>He is adamant that identity is not \u201cjust a philosopher\u2019s fuss\u201d and that the world bears the scars of endless crusades fought to protect it. </p> <p>\u201cMistakes about race were at the heart of the Rwandan genocide; the invasion of Iraq in 2003 was shaped by American nationalism and chauvinism about Muslims; nationality is clearly stopping us doing our part in dealing with things such as the refugee crisis, because we feel like it will threaten our own identity,\u201d says Appiah. \u201cThis crisis that we are facing now is rooted in these moral and intellectual confusions about identity.

The organization <a href=\"http://www.demos.org/publication/bullies-ballot-box-protecting-freedom-vote-against-wrongful-challenges-and-intimidation\">said in 2012</a> it wanted to make the experience of voting for those voters \u201clike driving and seeing the police following you\u201d.</p> \n<p>But Trump\u2019s predictions of a rigged election have put him out of step even with many of his <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/rubio-toomey-dispute-trump-rigged-elections-claims-debates-n668006\">fellow Republicans</a>, including his own running mate, Indiana governor <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2016/10/16/498152787/mike-pence-we-will-absolutely-accept-the-result-of-the-election\">Mike Pence</a>, who said on Sunday: \u201cWe will absolutely accept the results of the election.\u201d</p> \n<p>Even the former senator Kit Bond of Missouri, who was one of the first to advocate voter ID laws, and memorably claimed to have found a <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/07/voter-suppression-kevin-drum\">springer spaniel</a> who voted Democratic, has said that Trump\u2019s evidence-free pre-emptive allegation of vote-rigging <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/10/republicans-rigged-election-claim-donald-trump-229630\">\u201cisn\u2019t going to cut it\u201d.</a> </p> \n<p>The split with the party may itself be an obstacle to Trump pursuing any kind of post-election challenge, because the top election officials in several swing states, including Florida, North Carolina, Wisconsin, Georgia and Arizona, are Republicans. If they raise no objection to certifying the results, it is unlikely Trump by himself can do anything to change their minds.</p>",
  "<p>It\u2019s 16 November, 2015: I am seated at my father\u2019s old piano in tranquil, uneventful Kansas City, Missouri, with a pile of 60 obscure Neapolitan arias. I\u2019m researching music for my new album, music by composers such as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niccol%C3%B2_Jommelli\">Niccol\u00f2 Jomelli</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonardo_Leo\">Leonardo Leo</a>, who wrote in a post-classical, pre-bel canto world that is sorely underrepresented today on recordings and concert platforms.</p> <p>My task is to select 10 of these obscure arias to feature on my album and perform on a world tour. Just the day before I had been in glossy Dallas, Texas singing the final emotion-filled performance of a new opera written for me by <a href=\"http://jakeheggie.com/great-scott-2015/\">Jake Heggie titled Great Scott</a>, which asks the pressing question, \u201cDoes art matter?\u201d \u2013 a question I often contemplate.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I decided to pose a question: 'In the midst of chaos, how do you find peace?'</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>My phone was propped up on the music rack of the piano \u2013 never a good idea for concentrated focus \u2013 but I was breaking my self-imposed rule because I was waiting for texts and postings from friends and colleagues in Paris who were dealing with the harrowing aftermath of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/paris-attacks\">Paris attacks</a>, which had rocked that city three days earlier. </p> <p>My head swirled. My heart wept. My artistic soul searched. </p> <p>Yet my deadline was looming and I had music in front of me, waiting to be discovered. It was music that was novel, to be sure, but it was striking me as hollow. How could I devote immense, intensive personal and professional resources to this project and dare to bring it to 20 cities, when the music sitting in front of me felt \u2013 apologies to these fine composers \u2013 like a gimmick while the world around me continued to surge out of control?</p> <p>And then, from the pile of my own music, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R7BYSgz8xY\">Dido</a> majestically appeared. And then <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Svegliatevi_nel_core\">Sesto</a>, in his war-torn desperation; and then the prisoner Almirena\u2019s haunting Lascia ch\u2019io pianga emerged, almost begging to be heard.</p> <p>I wrote to my Paris-based record company. \u201cHow is everyone?\u201d And then, \u201cDon\u2019t shout at me, but I need to change the project. I want to sing about war and peace.\u201d And to their credit, they abandoned our previously agreed theme and let me record a different album.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Exclusive video: Joyce DiDonato sings Handel\u2019s Lascia ch\u2019io pianga, from Rinaldo\">  <iframe src=\"//players.brightcove.net/13564929001/default_default/index.html?videoId=5165326249001\"allowfullscreenwebkitallowfullscreenmozallowfullscreenwidth=\"100%\"height=\"360\"></iframe> <figcaption><a href=\"http://players.brightcove.net/13564929001/default_default/index.html?videoId=5165326249001\">Exclusive video: Joyce DiDonato sings Handel\u2019s Lascia ch\u2019io pianga, from Rinaldo</a></figcaption> </figure>  <p>Three of the original Neopolitan arias made the final cut.

Other Purcell arias \u2013 from the Indian Queen and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonduca\">Bonduca</a> \u2013 were exciting discoveries for me, and often contrast war and peace within the same aria. </p> <p>But as the new theme sat with me, it became clear I couldn\u2019t simply present these two faces of our humanity and walk away. As a belligerent optimist, I wanted to not only offer a message of hope, but to engage my listeners in a more visceral way and show that this music (which has been heard and contemplated, in some cases, for over 400 years), is an animated, pleading mirror into each of our troubled hearts, and challenge the listener to examine their contribution to our whacked-out world. </p> <p>But I decided on war <em>and</em> peace because it\u2019s imperative that we see the darkness, the turmoil and the chaos, as well as the yearning and searching for peace and tranquility.

  "<p>Over the last couple of years I have written several items on this blog about the worrying lack of plurality in the Irish media market.</p> <p>I have pointed in particular to the fact that a billionaire businessman, Denis O\u2019Brien, owns far too wide a range of media outlets. And I have argued that such a concentration of ownership <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2016/sep/07/should-ireland-allow-denis-obriens-media-empire-larger\">poses potential threats to Ireland\u2019s democracy</a>.</p> <p>Now comes a report by four lawyers at two UK-based legal firms which raises similar concerns and calls on the Irish government to intervene.</p> <p>In the report, \u201con the concentration of media ownership in Ireland\u201d, the authors state: \u201cwe consider there to be a perfect storm which poses grave risks to freedom of expression and media pluralism in the Irish market\u201d.</p> <p>That storm is composed of O\u2019Brien\u2019s reach through newspapers and radio holdings in company with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2016/may/16/are-denis-obriens-legal-activities-some-kind-of-record\">his penchant for issuing writs against rival media outfits.</a></p> <p>To recap, O\u2019Brien is the largest shareholder in Independent News &amp; Media (INM), which publishes Ireland\u2019s two best-selling newspapers, plus the Sunday World and Dublin Herald. </p> <p>It also owns the Belfast Telegraph, 50% of the Irish Daily Star and 13 paid-for regional weeklies (<a href=\"http://www.independent.ie/business/media/inm-group-agrees-deal-to-buy-irishowned-regional-newspapers-35017815.html\">with seven more soon to be acquired</a>).<br></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.inmplc.com/about-inm/profile/\">According to the INM website</a>, it manages gross assets of \u20ac187.6m and is the largest newspaper contract printer and wholesale newspaper distributor on the island of Ireland.</p> <p>Then comes radio. O\u2019Brien is chairman and principal shareholder of Communicorp, which owns Ireland\u2019s two leading commercial radio talk stations, Newstalk and Today FM. In addition, it owns Dublin\u2019s 98FM, SPIN 1038, TXFM (soon to close) and SPIN South West.</p> <p>However, the state\u2019s public service broadcaster, RT\u00c9, is dominant in radio (and TV). It has been calculated, <a href=\"http://monitor.cmpf.eui.eu/mpm2015/results/ireland/\">in an October 2015 study</a>, that Communicorp has a 20% share of the Irish radio market. The company, citing \u201cindustry standard methodology\u201d, has challenged this, <a href=\"http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/news/ireland/article1689511.ece\">arguing that it is 16%</a>. </p> <p>Whatever the case, INM\u2019s newspaper dominance in addition to Communicorp\u2019s radio assets anchors O\u2019Brien as the country\u2019s major private media mogul.</p> <p>But there is another aspect to O\u2019Brien\u2019s activities that exercises the new report\u2019s authors: Caoilfhionn Gallagher and Jonathan Price of London\u2019s Doughty Street Chambers, and Gavin Booth and Darragh Mackin of KRW Law in Belfast.</p> <p>Arguing that Ireland has \u201cone of the most concentrated media markets of any democracy\u201d, they contend that this \u201calarming\u201d feature has to be viewed alongside another \u201cgravely concerning aspect of the Irish media landscape\u201d.</p> <p>This is the \u201csustained and regular threats of legal action by Mr O\u2019Brien to media organisations and journalists who are engaged in newsgathering or reporting about his activities.\u201d</p> <p>And this has to be seen in the light of what the authors call the \u201cchilling effect\u201d of Ireland\u2019s current defamation laws. They argue: \u201cThis is a toxic combination for freedom of expression and media plurality\u201d.</p> <p>They believe it \u201cimperative that urgent action is taken\u201d and dismiss \u201csuggestions that this is a constitutional no-go area, or an European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) no-go area\u201d.</p> <p>But they concede that retroactive action to break up media holdings \u201cis a difficult area... affecting property rights and impacting upon an existing market\u201d.</p> <p>So they call for a \u201cdetailed multi-disciplinary analysis\u201d to consider \u201ccomplex and nuanced issues... including how precisely to measure plurality\u201d.</p> <p>To that end, they conclude: \u201cWe recommend that the government establish a cross-disciplinary commission of inquiry\u201d in order to examine the issues \u201cand make concrete recommendations, within a tight time frame\u201d. </p> <p>The authors were commissioned to compile a legal opinion by the Sinn F\u00e9in MEP Lynn Boylan on behalf of the European parliament\u2019s left-wing grouping <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_United_Left%E2%80%93Nordic_Green_Left\">GUE/NGL</a>.</p> <p>Boylan presented the study to the European Centre for Press and Media Freedom <a href=\"https://ecpmf.eu/2016/sched.html\">in Leipzig on 6 October</a>. She will launch it in Ireland next Monday (24 October), at the Cliff Town House on St Stephen\u2019s Green, Dublin, 2.30-4pm.</p> <p><strong>NB:</strong> If you happened to be wondering who might be the third-largest media owner in Ireland (after O\u2019Brien and RT\u00c9) it is Rupert Murdoch\u2019s News Corp, with Sky plus the Irish editions of the Sun, Times and Sunday Times. It is currently acquiring <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_Group\">the Wireless Group</a> (formerly UTV Media) with holdings that include six Irish local radio stations (including FM104) and a Belfast outlet.</p>",
  "<p>The Treasury blocked other government departments from charging diesel cars to enter towns and cities blighted by air pollution, documents revealed during a high court hearing on Tuesday.</p> <p>Legal NGO ClientEarth is challenging the government\u2019s pollution plan, which by law should cut illegal levels of nitrogen dioxide in the \u201cshortest possible time\u201d. Air pollution causes 50,000 early deaths and \u00a327.5bn in costs every year, according to the government\u2019s own estimates, and was called a \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/apr/27/uk-air-pollution-public-health-emergency-crisis-diesel-cars\">public health emergency</a>\u201d by MPs in April.</p> <p>It is the second time ClientEarth has sued the government over air pollution, which has broken EU legal limits since 2010 in many parts of the country. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/apr/29/supreme-court-orders-uk-to-draw-up-air-pollution-cleanup-plan\">ClientEarth won in the supreme court in 2015</a> and ministers were ordered to draw up an action plan, but ClientEarth argues even the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/dec/17/illegal-air-pollution-will-blight-many-uk-cities-for-at-least-five-years\">new plan</a> is illegal and has gone back to court. Government lawyers will put forward their defence on Wednesday, with the judgment expected in the following weeks or months.</p> <p>ClientEarth\u2019s lawyers have used government documents released as part of the legal process to bolster their arguments. One document shows the environment and transport departments wanted diesel cars, a major source of pollution, included the government\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/13/electric-vehicles-could-go-first-at-traffic-lights-under-uk-clean-air-zone-plans\">proposed Clean Air Zones</a>. But the Treasury blocked the move, with officials arguing it \u201cwould be politically very difficult, especially given the impacts on motorists\u201d.</p> <p>Another political consideration was how quickly the EU would move to impose fines on the UK for illegally high air pollution. In developing the air quality plan, the environment secretary, then Liz Truss, had sought the \u201cminimum\u201d steps needed to avoid fines, with officials advising that \u201c2020 is likely to be the earliest the EU will move to fines\u201d.</p> <p>ClientEarth argued that basing the target date for compliance on avoiding fines was arbitrary and did not meet the legal requirement to cut pollution in the shortest possible time.</p> <p>The government documents reveal that a more ambitious air quality plan was considered, with the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) stating in September 2015 that \u201cthe current plan represented the backstop option to tackle air quality which has already been pared back considerably\u201d.</p> <p>In May 2015, Defra officials had said a \u201cmost likely\u201d scenario would include wider use of low-emission zones in around 16 cities around London rather than six, and a package of wider national measures to tackle issues outside city centres [\u2026such as] scrappage or tax measures.\u201d </p> <p>The government has proposed just five mandatory Clean Air Zones (CAZs) outside London - in Birmingham, Leeds, Southampton, Nottingham and Derby - and rejected a scrappage scheme for older, dirty vehicles. Both the environment and transport departments recommended changes to Vehicle Excise Duty rates to encourage the purchase of low-pollution vehicles, but the Treasury rejected the idea.</p> <p>The government documents release show the chancellor, then George Osborne, was \u201cvery clear\u201d: he favoured the introduction of mandatory CAZs and \u201cnothing more\u201d.</p> <p>ClientEarth\u2019s lawyers also argued that modelling used by the government to assess the impact of its pollution plans failed to account fully for the fact that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/30/emissions-new-diesel-cars-far-higher-than-official-limit\">diesel cars emit far more pollution on the road</a> than in official lab-based tests. ClientEarth\u2019s lawyers said the documents show the environment department\u2019s officials were aware that their modelling was very optimistic. The existing data shows that 14-18 CAZs would have to be created to ensure pollution falls to legal levels by 2020, not five, according to ClientEarth. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"37e2c0d4747105f10ea6e614fdf44d8069ed42a1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/37e2c0d4747105f10ea6e614fdf44d8069ed42a1/0_0_4000_2896/1000.jpg\" alt=\"CEO of ClientEarth James Thornton (left) and ClientEarth lawyer Alan Andrews outside the high court in London.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"724\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">CEO of ClientEarth James Thornton (left) and ClientEarth lawyer Alan Andrews outside the high court in London.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Philip Toscano/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>ClientEarth lawyer Alan Andrews said: \u201cGeorge Osborne has some serious questions to answer. The Treasury\u2019s approach in the face of the tragic toll of air pollution in this country was to oppose anything but the bare minimum as too expensive. But what makes [Osborne\u2019s] behaviour even less understandable is that there is also a significant economic impact.\u201d Andrews said action to cut air pollution would benefit the economy more than it costs.</p> <p>ClientEarth is asking the court to order another new, more effective plan that could include a national network of CAZs and a retrofitting scheme for buses and HGVs.</p> <p>\u201cEvery day that passes air pollution is damaging the lungs of children across the UK,\u201d said Prof Jonathan Grigg, an expert on respiratory medicine and member of the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/groups/committee-on-the-medical-effects-of-air-pollutants-comeap#membership\">Committee on the Medical Effects of Air Pollutants</a>, which advises the government. \u201cIt is therefore not acceptable to hope that air pollution will fall at some point in the distant future. The government must act now to protect this generation of children.\u201d</p> <p>A government spokesperson said: \u201cThe government is firmly committed to improving the UK\u2019s air quality and cutting harmful emissions. That\u2019s why we have committed more than \u00a32bn since 2011 to increase the uptake of ultra-low emissions vehicles, support greener transport schemes and set out a national plan to tackle pollution in our towns and cities. We cannot comment on ongoing legal proceedings.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Theresa May was recently asked what makes her angry.

She <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/22/4500-slavery-victims-supported-by-salvation-army-in-five-years\">has established a \u00a333m fund</a> focused on \u201chigh risk countries where we know victims are regularly trafficked to the UK\u201d.

So having a UK prime minister who makes slavery eradication one of her priorities is to be welcomed and is an opportunity to further advance the work many of us have been doing for such a long time.</p> <p>To make a lasting difference, May will need to broaden her perspective beyond a criminal justice response to slavery. Crucially, she will need to ensure that other policy areas that can directly impact slavery \u2013 in particular trade, development, migration and international human rights law \u2013 are not neglected.</p> <p>There is already a risk that the current anti-immigration rhetoric and the <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2016/19/contents/enacted\">Immigration Act 2016, </a>with its introduction of an \u201cillegal working\u201d offence, will undermine the intent of the Modern Slavery Act. </p> <p>As early as 2006 Anti-Slavery International identified how enslaved people often had their migration status made irregular to increase the power that traffickers had over them, allowing them to be threatened with denunciation to the authorities and deportation. In other words, traffickers typically try to render their victims in a position of \u201cillegal working\u201d as part of the process of their enslavement. </p> <p>It used to be commonplace for victims of trafficking to report a lack of interest of the police in their plight, which, to her credit, May recognises as a considerable failure in the UK\u2019s domestic response to slavery. However, the new offence of \u201cillegal working\u201d can only lead to further confusion.</p> <p>A closer look at statistics of the<a href=\"http://www.nationalcrimeagency.gov.uk/about-us/what-we-do/specialist-capabilities/uk-human-trafficking-centre/national-referral-mechanism\"> national referral mechanism</a>, the UK-wide slavery victim identification and protection system, reveals that immigration status has a huge influence on how likely a victim is to be protected. For example, of those referred to the NRM, 77% of Poles and 67% of Lithuanians were recognised as victims of trafficking in 2015, while only 11% of Vietnamese and 10% of Nigerians were equally lucky. Given this, one cannot blame a trafficked Nigerian for being hesitant to come forward as a victim.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/aug/11/rescuing-trafficked-fishermen-cape-town-south-africa-slave-like-conditions\">Bid for freedom: rescuing trafficked fishermen as they dock in Cape Town</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It was good to hear that a big part of the \u00a333m will be spent in the countries seen as the main sources of trafficking to Britain, such as Nigeria and Vietnam. Poverty and lack of opportunities in source countries are big factors behind trafficking, so development efforts should contribute to minimising those risks. However, rejecting a big majority of potential victims from those countries and most often deporting them is at odds with that approach. </p> <p>As the prime minister prepares to lead Britain out of the EU she will need to find other trading partners. India is being mentioned as one such nation, despite the fact that the wholesale failure of rule of law for millions of Dalits contributes to their enslavement, often in export-oriented industries that provide our high streets with cheap clothes. How likely is it that modern slavery considerations will feature in those negotiations? </p> <p>No doubt, by way of response to these slavery concerns in international trade, May would point to the important transparency in supply-chain provisions in the Modern Slavery Act, which were the result of intense lobbying by ethically minded British businesses. </p> <p>However, even the most robust business action cannot take the place of the essential governmental action required to establish the necessary human rights protections \u2013 in international trade policy and national business and employment regulation \u2013 that are needed to eradicate slavery from international business supply chains. </p> <p>I have no doubt May\u2019s intentions on slavery are honourable. But they will be hamstrung from the outset if she does not consider carefully how other policies can contribute directly to that cause of her visceral anger: the very positions of power that some chose to abuse. </p>",
  "<p>Last week, the <a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/backbench-business-committee/news-parliament-2015/mps-debate-baby-loss/\" title=\"\">MPs Antoinette Sandbach and Will Quince brought a debate to parliament on baby loss</a>. Sandbach lost her five-day-old little boy Sam, and Quince\u2019s son Robert was stillborn. It was their bravery and honesty that made me wonder, should I speak out too?</p> <p>In contemplating this decision, I struggled with whether I was able to do this and what I could achieve by sharing my personal experience of how I lost my little girl, Veronica, at five days old. I knew that this was an opportunity for those also affected by similar losses to commemorate their babies, and to raise awareness of how many babies\u2019 lives are lost. In 2014, <a href=\"http://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/bulletins/deathsregistrationsummarytables/2015-07-15#infant-perinatal-and-neonatal-deaths\" title=\"\">there were 3,254 stillbirths and 2,689 infants\u2019 deaths</a> in England and Wales. For a country as well developed as ours these numbers are shocking.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/oct/13/mp-vicky-foxcroft-moving-speech-losing-baby-labour\">MP Vicky Foxcroft gives moving speech about losing her baby</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I battled with the idea of talking openly about Veronica all week. Most of my friends didn\u2019t know about her and the thought of sharing something so personal and painful in public was daunting, I could barely even write it down. It was never about being embarrassed or ashamed, it was just too hard to talk about. It still is.</p> <p>Emotion isn\u2019t something you often see in the Commons but I\u2019ve always tried to be the type of politician who people can relate to, even if I can barely stand up when I do, and shake like a pneumatic drill. Talking about things is how we tackle the taboo, it\u2019s how we raise awareness.</p> <p>The day before the debate, my close friend Gloria DePiero was worried about me and asked if I was OK. I couldn\u2019t tell her what I was thinking, so I texted her later to let her know I was considering speaking in the debate as she was one of the few friends who knew about Veronica. She rang to say I should definitely do it, and that she would be by my side throughout.</p> <p>It was late the night before that I made my mind up that I would speak about my daughter. The next stage was to phone my close family and friends who I had previously never told about Veronica. My mum, who obviously knew what I had gone through, was the only sceptic: she just didn\u2019t want to see her daughter hurting again.</p> <p>But the next day I stood up in the Commons and told my story. The story of how when I was 16 I fell pregnant and how it was unplanned and unexpected, but none of those things took away how much I love Veronica.</p> <p>I spoke about the traumatic labour that led to my healthy girl being taken away from me. How it felt so cruel at the time and how it still does to this day. No mother or father should have to go through this. It stays with you forever. It never goes away, even if it does get slightly easier over time.</p> <p>After Veronica was taken from me, I used college as a way of escape. I resat my English GCSE as I needed to get a C to go to university. The night before my exam I dreamed about her. Then when I sat in front of my exam paper, my test question was \u201cwho is the most influential person in your life?\u201d, there was only one answer: Veronica. I still dream about what she would be like, how we would get on, would she love me, or would I be a pain in her backside, always nagging for her to do more. I will never ever know the answers to any of these questions.</p> <p>It was, and will probably always be the hardest speech I have ever had to write, but I know it was the right thing to do. I know because of the emails and phone calls I have had from parents reaching out, parents who are suffering the type of pain you only experience after losing a child. No one can take away the aching sadness that it causes, but we can at least put in place a better support system if it does.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/oct/09/stillbirth-candid-documentary-still-loved-families\">Untold grief: the heartbreaking impact of stillbirth is revealed in new documentary</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The government\u2019s commitment to a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/nov/13/jeremy-hunt-cut-number-stillbirths-neonatal-deaths\" title=\"\">20% reduction in stillbirth rates by 2020 </a>is a start but the lack of support for parents now suffering the loss of their child should be treated with urgency.

In my constituency, Lewisham Deptford, bereavement counselling has a waiting list of up to four months. This isn\u2019t good enough.</p> <p>Veronica\u2019s death left me frightened and I knew I wouldn\u2019t be able to go through losing another child, so I haven\u2019t put myself in that position. Many people have told me of the fear they had through subsequent pregnancies and how some simple things, like not having to re-explain their experience, helped. Having the same consultant and ensuring there are regular check-ups and scans to ease the worry are also all important.</p> <p>If my story has shone a light on the inadequate level of support available, then it will have been worth every second of pain I went through sharing it.

  "<p>A group of high-profile men, including singer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/cliff-richard\">Sir Cliff Richard</a> and broadcaster <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2015/sep/15/paul-gambaccini-tougher-action-false-claims-sexual-abuse\">Paul Gambaccini</a>, have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/oct/17/ban-on-naming-sexual-suspects-cliff-richard-paul-gambaccini\">launched a campaign</a> to change the law so that people accused of sex crimes would not be named unless they are charged. It is impossible to discuss such a campaign without setting it in the wider context of misconceptions about sexual violence and those who report it; misconceptions that have been particularly widely aired in the aftermath of the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/14/footballer-ched-evans-cleared-of-in-retrial\">recent Ched Evans not-guilty verdict</a>, which saw many make similar calls for anonymity on social media.</p> <p>Entwined with such demands is the public perception that false rape allegations are common. While there are some allegations which prove false, there are misconceptions about the extent of them. There are widespread stereotypes: of \u201cpromiscuous\u201d women who regret sexual activity and \u201ccry rape\u201d, or vindictive women who set out to ruin men\u2019s lives with false accusations, either for money or revenge. Whether intentionally or not, any conversation about anonymity in the judicial process raises the spectre of these figures. In the wake of the Evans verdict, they could clearly be seen in <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://twitter.com/futboyadam/status/786945986580983808\">tweets such as</a>: \u201cThis confirms that 80% of rape \u2018victims\u2019 are just drunk sluts who regret being a whore on a night out,\u201d as well as in the complainant repeatedly being branded a \u201cmoney-grabbing whore\u201d online.</p> <p>This betrays a confusion about our legal system: a not-guilty verdict does not mean a complainant lied, but that the alleged offence could not be proven beyond reasonable doubt.</p> <p>The waters are further muddied by calls for complainants to be stripped of their anonymity to \u201clevel the playing field\u201d, an argument that saw the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2016/oct/14/social-media-naming-of-ched-evans-accuser-raises-questions-law\">name of Evans\u2019s accuser shared</a> thousands of times on social media both in the aftermath of the initial case, and after the recent verdict. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/EverydaySexism/status/786967988205449216\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Those who claim this is about the verdict should remember near identical abuse after previous trial found Ched Evans guilty <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/RapeCulture?src=hash\">#RapeCulture</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/0wSr1NF96Y\">pic.twitter.com/0wSr1NF96Y</a></p>&mdash; EverydaySexism (@EverydaySexism) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/EverydaySexism/status/786967988205449216\">October 14, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>But such responses completely misunderstand the nature of sexual violence.

A Crown Prosecution Service review found that in a 17-month period, there were 5,651 prosecutions for rape and 111,891 for domestic violence. During the same period there were 35 prosecutions for making false allegations of rape. Even among that small number of cases, the complainants were often young and vulnerable, including some with mental health difficulties and, in some cases, the person alleged to have made the false report had \u2013 in the words of then-director of public prosecutions <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/mar/13/false-allegations-rape-domestic-violence-rare\">Keir Starmer</a> \u2013 \u201cundoubtedly been the victim of some kind of offence, even if not the one that he or she had reported\u201d.</p> <p>Now compare those numbers to the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/an-overview-of-sexual-offending-in-england-and-wales\">85,000 women raped every year, according to government statistics</a>, roughly 70,000 who don\u2019t feel able to report, and a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2013/jan/11/male-female-rape-statistics-graphic\">conviction rate of just 1,070 rapists</a>. Simply put, the number of people whose lives are impacted by false allegations is dwarfed by the number who might be prevented from accessing justice if anonymity were granted to the accused (or denied to the accuser) in such cases.</p> <p>This doesn\u2019t mean we should shrug our shoulders and ignore the experiences of those such as Richard and Gambaccini. Rather, as Evaw urges, we should focus on the true cause of distress and harm in such cases, which is not our legal system, with its principle of innocent until proven guilty, but a sensationalist media producing deeply unsatisfactory reporting on sexual violence.</p> <p>This sees those accused of sex offences painted as evil \u201cmonsters\u201d; a response that does nothing to help the struggle against sexual violence. Coverage does victims no favours either, from the <a href=\"http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/rape-not-romp-it-time-end-titillating-portrayal-sexual-violence-1548176\">description of rape in inappropriate and mitigating terms</a> to the portrayal of survivors as either perfect victims or flawed women who brought offences upon themselves. This should be thoroughly investigated and action should be taken to try to resolve these problems. But extending anonymity to those accused of sexual offences is not the answer, and could do great harm to survivors in an area where it is already very hard to achieve justice.</p>",

He said: \u201cPeople forget how horrible <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/aug/06/our-family-divided-by-the-troubles\">the Troubles</a> were and that was only 20 years ago.

  "<h2><strong>Stunting children\u2019s lives</strong><br></h2> <p>I found deeply depressing the comment from World Bank president Jim Yong Kim about stunted children in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) not reading a single letter after going through three or four years of schooling <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/sep/30/world-bank-name-and-shame-countries-fail-stunted-children\" title=\"\">(7 October)</a>. Fortunately, Peru is showing the way in addressing this dreadful problem of stunting, notably, by giving cash grants to mothers and monitoring children to ensure they are getting the nutrition they need.</p> <p>It worries me, however, that the mother cited in the article, although doing all the right things with the money to prevent stunting in her younger four, had eight children all told. Whether this was by choice or not, the fact remains that for poor families it is easier to feed two children than eight.</p> <p>Perhaps it is correlation rather than causation, but those countries that have a high incidence of stunting also have high fertility rates. Thus it would seem logical, indeed humane, to provide voluntary family planning services in association with the cash handouts and monitoring of children. Most sub-Saharan countries still have very strong cultural preferences for large families; nevertheless, if mothers could be persuaded to space their children a minimum of three years apart, it would allow for better nutrition of babies and toddlers, and indeed of the mothers themselves if they become pregnant again.<br><strong>Jenny Goldie</strong><br>Michelago, NSW, Australia</p> <h2><strong>The Dalai Lama\u2019s worth</strong><br></h2> <p>Squeezing him out is probably not the best solution, but is the Dalai Lama <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/02/the-guardian-view-on-the-dalai-lama-dont-squeeze-him-out\" title=\"\">(7 October)</a> worth all the fuss?

Since a whopping 98% of those who did vote favoured the proposal, Orb\u00e1n\u2019s deputy head could claim a \u201csweeping victory\u201d over the EU \u2013 a sort of Hungarian Brexit. Except that it wasn\u2019t. By simply not voting, a majority of the Hungarian people brought it down, constitutionally: to pass, it had needed a 50% turnout and only got 43.9%.</p> <p>Szirtes was a young boy among the quarter-million Hungarians who became refugees after the heroic uprising of 1956 against the Soviet Union\u2019s puppet state. What a heartless irony that a Hungarian prime minister should seek to turn present-day refugees away. And what a strange one that he is in bed with the ruler of Russia. And strangest of all that a candidate for US president would love to join them.<br><strong>John Ridland</strong><br>Santa Barbara, California, US</p> <h2><strong>Brexit future looks bleak</strong><br></h2> <p>As Jonathan Freedland points out, there is a significant minority in the UK who did not vote for Brexit, as well as many dissenters amongst those who did, who cannot accept Theresa May\u2019s Thatcheresque posturing from a position of demonstrable weakness <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/07/marching-mad-brexit-someone-speak-48-per-cent\" title=\"\">(14 October)</a>. The only visible deal to be negotiated is one of a \u201csoft Brexit\u201d that appeases both the Ukip anti-immigration faction as well as the still-dominant Merkel faction, who insist on all EU members accepting some level of free movement and acceptance of refugees. A difficult fence to straddle, if the ultimate goal is to maintain as a minimum the favoured-nation trading status enjoyed by Norway.</p> <p>May\u2019s poker hand is very short on winning cards \u2013 the bluff that the rights of current EU citizens in Britain could be at risk if Britain fails to get the terms it demands seems little short of suicidal, as the current falling value of sterling indicates. May\u2019s only recourse if her terms for a continuing relationship with the EU are rejected, would be a closer relationship with either China or the US, clearly risky options as well as being mutually exclusive.</p> <p>This is clearly a case where the longer-term national interest must take priority over individual or party interest, but where are the champions of this interest? In the unlikely event of the legal challenge to the validity of the Brexit vote succeeding, we might see a consensus of parliamentarians whose vision is broader than that of the current leadership, but without such an outcome, the future looks bleak.<br><strong>Noel Bird</strong><br>Boreen Point, Queensland, Australia</p> <h2><strong>Car travel is far too cheap</strong><br></h2> <p>George Monbiot is, of course, right to point out how we have become addicted to cars, but I wouldn\u2019t hold my breath about this changing anytime soon <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/20/roads-car-use-health-driving\" title=\"\">(30 September)</a>. Far from \u201csitting fuming in a toxic cloud\u201d, most car journeys are actually quite convenient and cheap. And this where the problems start.</p> <p>The marginal cost of running a car is so low that if you own a car you would be mad (or really dedicated) to consider paying at least twice this to use an infrequent bus or train or even walk. We have friends who think nothing of driving a few hundred metres to visit us.</p> <p>Perhaps modern smart-card technology will eventually allow drivers to pay the full cost of their own car as they use it. In our village we have a community car club where cars can be hired by the hour at a fully inclusive rate, but it is still difficult to wean people off their own car. If the fuel duty were increased significantly this would help, but what government would have the courage to do this?</p> <p>Our behaviours that cause climate change are so embedded and habitual, and climate change is seen as so distant, that change will be difficult. If we are serious about tackling climate change we need a combination of the imaginative solutions George Monbiot describes and some real sticks (such as fuel duty increases) to fund these.<br><strong>Martin Mansell</strong><br>Lochwinnoch, UK</p> <p>\u2022 George Monbiot is correct that if a transportation system were designed today with the objective of moving people efficiently, it would not focus on the private automobile. However, at least in North America, our transportation systems were not designed for efficient movement, but rather for auto industry profit.</p> <p>The car companies bought up the streetcar systems of almost every major North American city \u2013 Toronto and San Francisco alone successfully resisted \u2013 in order to tear up the rails and create a market for their product.

  "<p>You might say that Colin Stanbridge is in the confidence business.

Now comes the turbulence of Brexit. Stanbridge remains upbeat. </p> <p>\u201cBusinesses, especially the smaller ones, are very pragmatic,\u201d he says. It is the very first thing he says when asked about the impact of the Leave vote, sitting in his office in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_Street,_London\">Queen Street</a> in the Square Mile. \u201cThey may well have been shocked, as many people were, that the vote across the country went the way it did, but I have absolutely no doubt that they will find a way through and that London will find a way through.\u201d</p> <p>The optimistic note is struck against a pessimistic backdrop. The <a href=\"http://www.londonchamber.co.uk/lcc_public/article.asp?aid=6185\">most recent of the LCCCI\u2019s regular Capital 500 surveys</a>, conducted by ComRes during August, unearthed continuing deteriorating expectations that had begun in the run-up to the EU referendum and are now projected into the future. The survey found that during the third quarter of this year, both domestic and export demand for goods and services fell, as did employment levels. It concluded that \u201con balance, 9% of London businesses expected their overall company prospects to decline, moving into negative territory for the first time\u201d.</p> <p>Stanbridge has called for \u201csolid reassurance\u201d from the government and warned against complacency: \u201cAs we said in our <a href=\"http://www.londonchamber.co.uk/docimages/14720.pdf\">Brexit response</a>, no one is panicking. However, there are serious issues the government needs to recognise.\u201d For him, the opportunity side of the Brexit balance sheet is largely about concentrating minds on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/davehillblog/2016/oct/15/theresa-may-brexit-strategy-could-depend-on-giving-london-more-autonomy\">London\u2019s strengths</a> as a business environment and the value of making them stronger. </p> <p>As employers weigh the pros and cons of re-locating, Stanbridge asks out loud if they really want to ship out to Stuttgart. Or even Paris: \u201cWe have a huge number of advantages in terms of the language, the legal system and, actually, very importantly, as a place to live.\u201d The Chamber is urging support for exporters and has renewed long-standing calls for decisive further investment in transport capacity and for <a href=\"http://www.standard.co.uk/comment/colin-stanbridge-forget-scotland-london-needs-more-power-9276670.html\">greater devolution</a> of powers to London government. </p> <p>The cry is to press boldly ahead with Crossrail 2 <em>and</em> a <a href=\"http://www.ciht.org.uk/en/wra/news/index.cfm/transport-chiefs-look-ahead-to-crossrail-3\">Crossrail 3</a>; <em>and</em> with new river crossings in the east; <em>and</em> with airport expansion - not just one more runway, <a href=\"http://www.standard.co.uk/comment/comment/colin-stanbridge-if-we-mean-business-we-must-expand-both-gatwick-and-heathrow-10017904.html\">but two</a>!: \u201cWe need these things. We need them more than ever.\u201d Stanbridge says he wrote to Sadiq Khan and had a meeting with him, urging him to revisit and enlarge on the work of the London Finance Commission (LFC) set up by Boris Johnson, which argued for giving the mayor and the boroughs direct control over the use to which all property taxes raised in the capital were put. Khan, already a convert, did just that. An <a href=\"https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/london_finance_commission_interim_report_october_2016_v1.0.pdf\">interim report</a> by LFC2 concludes that there is also \u201cscope to devolve an assigned share of one or more major national taxes,\u201d as a way of facilitating growth, making a better job of tackling deprivation and taking \u201csteps towards a better-run country.\u201d </p> <p>And then there\u2019s the the question of labour. \u201cIn our round table discussions with members, the message about talent and migrant workers and the necessity of having those workers in London is huge. We have to find some way to keep them or London will be severely damaged,\u201d Stanbridge says. An advocate of introducing a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/davehillblog/2016/jul/11/the-case-for-a-more-independent-post-brexit-london-is-gaining-strength\">London-specific work permit or visa</a>, he accepts that the case for foreign migration can be difficult to make. Politicians will speak up for wooing the highly-skilled and qualified but not \u201cthe people who keep the hospitals clean and make the Underground run. They may not be, in those terms, highly-skilled workers, but they are vital.\u201d </p> <p>Anticipating objections that London business favours a liberal line on overseas labour because they provide a source of cheap labour, he speaks of his own ancestry: Polish, three generations back, settling in Liverpool. \u201cIt\u2019s about the city I want to live in. Some people get angry that they come off the Tubes and buses and don\u2019t hear an English accent in the shops, but I think that\u2019s great. As a citizen of London, I want it to be a city that says, \u2018You know what? You come here, you work hard, you pay your taxes, you are law-abiding, then you are a Londoner.\u2019 If we lose that, it\u2019s bad for the city.\u201d</p> <p>Stanbridge dismisses the idea that the Brexit negotiations should be approached as \u201csome kind of poker game\u201d in which the UK\u2019s hand must remain fully concealed. For him, the broad outline of the best possible deal is already perfectly clear, and London should be at the heart of striking it: if you can\u2019t have full access to the single market and the free movement of people at the same time, then you bargain for the nearest to both you can get. It\u2019s about pragmatism. It\u2019s about confidence. It\u2019s about doing business. </p>",

  "<p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/18/uk-inflation-rises-near-two-year-high-consumer-price-index\">rise in the annual inflation rate</a> to 1% last month is just the start. The <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/bulletins/consumerpriceinflation/sept2016\">cost of living in Britain</a> is certain to increase noticeably over the next 12 months and likely to peak at about 3%, perhaps even a bit higher.</p> <p>A bit of perspective is needed. By Britain\u2019s recent standards, inflation is still low. Harold Wilson could only dream of 1% inflation when prices were shooting up at an annual rate of almost 26% in 1975. Despite her best efforts, Margaret Thatcher never managed to drive inflation down to its current level.</p> <p>This is a different age. Globalisation, de-unionisation and weak growth have led to the death of inflation. For the past two or three years, the big fear for central banks has been deflation rather than inflation.</p> <p>Britain no longer has that problem. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/11/pound-completes-worst-four-day-performance-since-brexit-vote\">sharp fall in the value of the pound</a> since the referendum on 23 June has banished any fear of deflation for several years to come, because anything that is imported \u2013 from French wine to Apple iPhones \u2013 costs more.<br></p> <p>The upward movement in September from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/13/uk-inflation-remains-unchanged-at-06\">0.6% in the year to August</a> did not have much to do with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/16/let-the-pound-fall-and-the-economy-rise\">slide in the pound\u2019s value</a>, but make no mistake, the fall in sterling will eventually <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/13/marmite-bananas-sterling-swings-prices-consumers-shopping\">feed through into higher prices</a> in the shops and at petrol stations.</p> <p>Two factors explain the inflation increase. The first is that some prices are going up. Clothing was dearer, motorists noticed that petrol and diesel were a bit more expensive. Hotel bills were also higher, which is mainly explained by the above inflation <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/apr/01/the-national-living-wage-and-what-it-means\">increase in the minimum wage</a> in April. The higher salary costs that resulted from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/mar/29/the-guardian-view-on-the-national-living-wage-not-the-end-but-the-beginning\">introduction of the \u201cnational living wage\u201d</a> are being passed on to customers.</p> <p>The second reason for the upward movement is that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/oct/13/uk-inflations-dips-below-zero\">prices were falling in September 2015</a>, due to tumbling global energy costs. That has since ceased to flatter the annual inflation rate.</p> <p>There were further sharp falls in energy prices during the final quarter of last year, so had sterling remained unchanged <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/03/uk-stocks-rally-as-brexit-fears-fade\">on the foreign exchanges</a> in recent weeks, there would still have been a pickup in the annual inflation rate.</p> <p>The fall in the pound to its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/06/brexit-pound-plunges-to-30-year-lows-as-eu-fears-bite-into-global-markets-again\">lowest level against the dollar</a> since the mid-1980s will accelerate this process. While inflation is still comfortably below the government\u2019s 2% target, it won\u2019t be for long. Expect the annual cost of living increase to reach 2% by early 2017 and 3% by next summer.</p> <p>Competition in the high street could spare consumers from some of the effects of the weak pound. But if businesses find they are operating with lower profit margins, they will seek to save money by tightly controlling wages. One way or another, living standards <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/17/rising-inflation-expected-to-hit-consumers-pockets-pound-sterling-dollar-brexit\">are going to be squeezed</a>.</p> <p>What\u2019s more, government welfare changes mean those on the lowest incomes will be especially hard hit, because George Osborne\u2019s July 2015 budget froze non-pensioner benefits in cash terms for the duration of the current parliament. <a href=\"https://www.ifs.org.uk/publications/8699\">The Institute for Fiscal Studies </a>estimates that 11.5 million benefit claimants would have been \u00a3260 a year worse off by 2019-20 before sterling\u2019s slide. Higher inflation has pushed that figure to \u00a3360.</p> <p>Will higher inflation lead to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/28/uk-bank-of-england-monetary-stimulus-brexit-vote-effects-minouche-shafik\">Bank of England raising interest rates</a>? Almost certainly not.

But as consumers we need a stronger incentive for companies to confront and prevent slavery in the supply chains they receive goods and services from. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2013/apr/03/modern-day-slavery-explainer\">Modern-day slavery: an explainer</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Extending our criminal law to cover cases where UK-based or UK-linked businesses intentionally or recklessly engage in slavery or forced labour in their supply chains overseas would plug the gap. </p> <p>Let\u2019s not forget that it is often in countries where there is a weak rule of law or an absence of fair worker rights that slavery, forced labour and trafficking thrive. </p> <p>The law currently says if we commit a slavery crime, we will be punished. Why not then the UK companies and individuals who are engaged in supply-chain slavery overseas and profit from the labour of the enslaved?</p> <h2>Abolishing the slave trade</h2> <p>The fact that we need to change a law that only recently came into force is not unusual or unprecedented. If we look back in history we see that all of our slavery-related legislation has had an incremental approach. There were dozens of pieces of English legislation that finally enabled the abolition of the transatlantic slave trade in all of its form 200 years ago. </p> <p>It is only through seeing the law in action that we recognise where the gaps lie. The UK criminal offence of holding a person in slavery or requiring a person to perform forced labour was only passed <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2009/25/section/71\" rel=\"nofollow\">in 2009</a>, when the legislation gap was exposed by one of my cases, and it soon became the most successful modern criminal legislation geared towards prosecuting and convicting those who enslave. </p> <p>We already have extra-territorial jurisdiction for some very serious crimes. If we think about child sexual exploitation cases involving British people, such as in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/social-care-network/2014/dec/19/simon-harris-british-citizens-child-abuse\">Kenya</a>, these people can be prosecuted in the UK. The crime of torture can be prosecuted here too, wherever it took place. Corporate acts of slavery and forced labour abroad need to be treated with the same seriousness.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>We also have the resources ready to investigate companies. Police forces in the UK, admittedly some better than others, have expertise in trafficking and cross-border investigations. They would be able to investigate the slavery complaints of overseas victims and track slavery and forced labour in the overseas supply chains of UK companies, if the legislation could be extended.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/oct/07/cheap-seafood-fish-slavery-solutions-thailand-human-rights-abuse\">Our love of cheap seafood is tainted by slavery: how can it be fixed?</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>Letting victims seek compensation</h2> <p>As well as holding UK companies operating overseas accountable, we also need to extend our domestic slavery law to allow victims of slavery and trafficking in the UK to properly sue their enslavers and traffickers for civil compensation.<br></p> <p>Victims can currently seek compensation in the UK via existing laws. But these traditional compensation laws don\u2019t cover the full spectrum of harm done by traffickers and enslavers, including their use of subtle yet terrifying means of control, psychological abuse and damage, deception, coercion, the destruction of one\u2019s identity, taking a child into slavery, or debt-bondage.</p> <p>If victims had a clear right to civil compensation under British law for slavery, trafficking or forced labour they could bring a claim for damages against those responsible and it would also have a very serious impact on making businesses more accountable for slavery in their supply chains, as well as those individuals who enslave and traffic. The vast majority of trafficking and slavery cases don\u2019t end up in the criminal courts after all.<br></p> <p>In the US there is already a direct civil remedy for trafficking and forced labour in law, introduced <a href=\"http://www.state.gov/j/tip/laws/61130.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">in 2003</a>. It was designed to give compensation to victims but also act as a deterrent. In my experience, the best compensation laws for trafficking take this two-pronged approach.</p> <p>Recently, a US company Signal International was found liable and <a href=\"https://business-humanrights.org/en/signal-international-lawsuits-re-trafficking-of-indian-workers-in-usa\" rel=\"nofollow\">forced to pay compensation</a> to trafficked workers it deceived, indebted and abused on its construction sites after Hurricane Katrina. After losing a court case under the trafficking compensation laws the company later filed for bankruptcy. It was a chilling warning to companies across the US that they are liable for all the trafficking-related harm done to their victims.<br></p> <p>Civil compensation laws in the UK should be similarly clear: if you traffic or enslave people you will pay your victims for the harm you have done. We now need to modernise our Modern Slavery Act to do just that.</p>",
  "<p>In Colombia, it\u2019s often said, everyone is a doctor until proven otherwise. </p> <p>Not a medical doctor or even a PhD, that is: in Colombia\u2019s daily lexicon, the word is a form of address for anyone judged to hold a superior social station \u2013 or for those who wield power in the tangled web of bureaucracy.</p> <p>Expecting to be called \u201c<em>doctor</em>\u201d or \u201c<em>doctora</em>\u201d is a mark of endemic snobbery in a country where class distinctions are so entrenched that Colombians are formally classified into social strata depending not on their income but on where they live.<br></p> <p>In attempt to eliminate linguistic snootiness the mayor of Cali, Colombia\u2019s third largest city, has decided to ban the term \u201c<em>doctor</em>\u201d, and other forms of formal address, in municipal offices. </p> <p>\u201cIn the city offices the word <em>doctor</em> or <em>don</em> are prohibited,\u201d declared Mayor Maurice Armitage earlier this month.

When the restrictions were lifted on the legal practice, every lawyer became a \u201cdoctor\u201d, and the usage then spread to other professions. </p> <p>Today, though there are only a few hundred PhD holders in the country, the spurious title has evolved to become a pervasive marker of class and power.</p> <p>And any Colombian knows that when fighting your way through a labyrinth of red tape, it\u2019s always a good idea to address the person behind the desk as <em>doctor</em> or <em>doctora</em>.

  "<p>The film critic <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/oct/11/simon-mayo-mark-kermode-best-double-act-in-movies\">Mark Kermode</a> often talks about the moment when he realises he\u2019s in safe hands at a screening, and comes to understand that the film he\u2019s about to review is going to be fantastic, and that he can sit back, relax and begin to enjoy himself. That moment frequently comes within the first 10 seconds, he says. And it\u2019s a great feeling. Having just read The Bottle Factory Outing, I know exactly what he means. </p> <p>Here\u2019s the opening:<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The hearse stood outside the block of flats waiting for the old lady. Freda was crying. There were some children and a dog running in and out of the line of bare black trees planted in the pavement.</p> </blockquote> <p>You could be forgiven for thinking that those short, visual, declarative sentences are straightforward. For a couple of beats, I didn\u2019t make all that much of them. Then came the jolt. The fact that it was a hearse that was waiting for \u201cthe old lady\u201d meant that said aged being was, in fact, a corpse. And while I was chewing on that, there came the next line: \u2018\u201cI don\u2019t know why you\u2019re crying,\u201d said Brenda. \u201cYou didn\u2019t know her.\u201d\u2019</p> <p>Everything went just a little off kilter. The perfectly natural act of crying at a funeral became strange. Not very strange. But odd enough. Especially when combined with Brenda\u2019s entirely unsympathetic response to Freda\u2019s distress.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2010/dec/12/beryl-bainbridge-obituary-by-jojo-davies\">The Beryl Bainbridge I knew, by her daughter</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It isn\u2019t the most striking beginning to a novel. It won\u2019t ever be anthologised alongside Orwell\u2019s clocks striking 13, or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/gallery/2012/apr/29/ten-best-first-lines-fiction\">Anthony Burgess\u2019 catamite and archbishop</a>. But the fact that it is unshowy doesn\u2019t mean it isn\u2019t impressive writing. That assured understatement is a sign of an author in control. And an author who is going to mess you around in most delightful and unsettling ways.<br></p> <p>The Bottle Factory Outing more than delivers on that initial promise. Its sentences remain so masterfully restrained that you barely notice the barb until you\u2019ve taken a few steps on \u2013 and find yourself hooked back.<br></p> <p>I think I may have gasped when I finally caught up on the implications of the following statement about Freda and Brenda\u2019s sharing a sleeping space in their dingy bedsit:<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Brenda had fashioned a bolster to put down the middle of the bed and a row of books to ensure that they lay less intimately at night. Freda complained that the books were uncomfortable \u2013 but then she had never been married.</p> </blockquote> <p>After the surprise came a chuckle. It\u2019s funny to think that a husband could be so much less comfortable as a sleeping companion than a row of books. But after the laughter, came a shiver. What kind of a marriage must Brenda have endured?<br></p> <p>Some inkling of those horrors comes when Brenda\u2019s mother-in-law arrives and tries to shoot her with an air pistol. Prompting another moment of unsettling brilliance, as we look on the aftermath:<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cWe ought to make a cup of tea,\u201d said Brenda, looking at Stanley\u2019s mother. \u201cShe\u2019s had a shock.\u201d</p> <p>Mrs Haddon stared back without pity. \u201cI was aiming at your vocal chords. You always talked too much.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>Ouch. And the worst thing is that by this stage in the novel we know something of Brenda. I actually found myself questioning whether she does talk too much. And so found myself wondering whether an entirely unreasonable statement had any kind of justification. And so again, after the laughter there had come a stomach lurch. It\u2019s all similarly queasy and unsettling. It\u2019s tremendous artistry. It\u2019s a novel with a uniquely woozy feel \u2013 a jelly-legged sense of uncertainty \u2013 that feels all the stranger because the sentences appear so superficially straightforward.<br></p> <p>It is, in short, superb prose. There are perhaps few sentences that stand out as individual gems. But there are also few writers who offer more control and delight line-by-line.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/jul/10/beryl-bainbridge-hero-michael-holroyd\">My hero Beryl Bainbridge by Michael Holroyd</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And the best thing is that Bainbridge offers the same pleasures (and nasty surprises) on a chapter-by-chapter level too. Just as I found myself reading and re-reading and doubting the meaning of individual sentences, so later events in the novel threw everything in the early stages into confusion. Hilarious passages about Brenda\u2019s weak character, or the factory overseer Rossi\u2019s wandering hands, take on sinister new implications following the gloriously ugly denouement.<br></p> <p>Yet even a master like Bainbridge can not have planned or foreseen one of the other disturbing double-takes the novel provokes. The Bottle Factory Outing is a curious book to read so soon after the UK\u2019s EU referendum. It is set in England just before it joined the EEC and it is a drab, grey, poor world of rancid bedsits, where olives are exotic and hard to find and Italians an almost entirely unknown quantity:<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Patiently Freda explained that it wasn\u2019t a bottle factory, it was a wine factory \u2013 that they would be working alongside simple peasants who had culture and tradition behind them. Brenda hinted that she didn\u2019t like foreigners \u2013 she found them difficult to get on with. Freda said it proved how puny a person she was in mind and body.</p> </blockquote> <p>Passages like that also gave me another kind of stomach lurch. Is that the country that everyone wanted back? It made me feel like this book also has an urgent political message \u2013 even if none was originally intended. It is a book everyone should read, not just because it is a wonderful work of art in itself, but because it says so much about our world. And it\u2019s all the more impressive that it does so in so few pages (my edition is 179 pages long), in such short sentences, and with so many brilliant jokes. Beryl Bainbridge \u2013 what a writer!

We asked for your stories about whether you changed your surname and why. </p> <h2>Harry Matuszewicz-Milne, 34, from Bristol: I don\u2019t know why more men don\u2019t change their names</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"d8007e57e5411180b93e9f4232549aaf10299b23\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d8007e57e5411180b93e9f4232549aaf10299b23/0_0_280_280/280.png\" alt=\"Harry Matuszewicz-Milne\" width=\"280\" height=\"280\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>My wife is Polish and even over there her surname is fairly unusual. Her dad, who died the year after we married, was very into his family history. I had the impression that it was quite important to him that the name didn\u2019t disappear so I changed my name to a double-barrelled one (merging the two) when we married.</p> <p>I have never liked many of the traditions involved in weddings \u2013 I never even proposed. Why should she sit around waiting for me to make the move? We sat down and discussed marriage and agreed we both wanted to. I also saw her dress before the wedding. I helped her choose it. This obviously caused horror to family members, but she knew what I was wearing. I never would have got the outfit if she didn\u2019t like it, so we both assumed that worked both ways.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I never thought my wife\u2019s identity should become mine just because we were married</p> <footer> <cite>Harry Matuszewicz-Milne</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I never thought my wife\u2019s identity should become mine just because we were married. I also thought it was a lot of hassle to change names, so if she had to do all that, why shouldn\u2019t I?</p> <p>I suppose I am also quite vain and thought it would be pretty cool to have a double-barrelled and unique surname. In Aberdeen, where I\u2019m from originally, the phone book has about eight pages of Milnes and the idea of being different appealed to me. The only difficulties are that I spend my life spelling my surname out to people and correcting their pronunciation. Also, some online forms don\u2019t allow me to use my full surname because the dash is an unacceptable character (other times it\u2019s just too long).<br tabindex=\"-1\"><br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <h2>Janet Gilbert, 57, from Australia: Some resented me keeping my name</h2> <p>I came to London to do a PhD, having studied in Australia, Germany and Holland. At the time I planned to work in academia and was starting to write for academic journals, so my name was becoming known in my field of expertise. I fell madly in love with a wonderful fellow student and we decided to marry. I never even thought about changing my name: I\u2019d had it for 28 years and it was an integral part of me. It was complicated by the fact that my future mother-in-law and I shared the same first name, and already some people were calling me Janet two or Janet Junior: changing my surname would have been far too confusing. However, some members of my family weren\u2019t pleased about the fact I wanted to keep my own name. I couldn\u2019t see why it mattered and after 29 years of marriage it is just not an issue for me. I\u2019m always a bit surprised when friends do decide to change their names upon marrying.</p> <p>It caused resentment in some circles at first, and there have been occasional instances of confusion. For example, our car insurance premium seemed ridiculously high one year and when I asked why it cost so much to have my husband as a named driver, the premium immediately fell significantly as the company had assumed we weren\u2019t married and were not entitled to spousal discounts. </p> <p>We\u2019ve had five children who all have my husband\u2019s surname, with mine as a middle name. Some friends have joined their names or given their children two surnames, but both our names would have been a bit of a mouthful for any child, and I didn\u2019t feel strongly about our children having my surname, so we got the balance just about right. </p> <h2>Joanne Phillips, 46, from Shropshire: I feel a bit guilty that I won\u2019t pass on my father\u2019s name <br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"7d239b8f9f406af321914c676b7165fa7252d99b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7d239b8f9f406af321914c676b7165fa7252d99b/0_0_280_280/280.png\" alt=\"Joanne Philips\" width=\"280\" height=\"280\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>I got married quite late in life (aged 36), so I\u2019d had my maiden name for a long time, and I was reluctant to change it. As a feminist, I also didn\u2019t like moving from Miss to Mrs, while men stay with Mr all through their lives. However, in the end I felt a kind of internal pressure to go along with the romance of it: taking your husband-to-be\u2019s name is a symbol of commitment, rejecting it would have been framed as something entirely different. Plus, I reasoned that I was changing my identity in a significant way, so letting go of the old me, including saying goodbye to the name, was okay.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I\u2019ve never felt able to fully engage with the new person \u2013 who is this Mrs Phillips, exactly?</p> <footer> <cite>Joanne Phillips</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Ten years on, I wish I\u2019d pushed for a double-barrelled solution, or simply kept my own name. I\u2019ve never felt able to fully engage with the new person \u2013 who is this Mrs Phillips, exactly? But once you use a name professionally it becomes part of you, even if you\u2019re not entirely at one with it. And I do resent that the full burden of identity-changing is placed on women. At the same time, as a parent I appreciate that it is more straightforward if the whole family shares one name. But is that enough of a reason? I don\u2019t know. </p> <p>Our daughter has my husband\u2019s surname. Thinking about it from the perspective of a name being passed down, I do regret that my former surname, Tasker, will now go nowhere. I have one sister, who has no children. And I feel a little guilty that I won\u2019t pass on my father\u2019s name. Oh great, more guilt.</p> <h2>Shraddha Kaul, 27, from London: In spite of Indian tradition, I kept my maiden name</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"5fdb82e270b19d9cfdcd575f4a3532d129909942\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5fdb82e270b19d9cfdcd575f4a3532d129909942/0_0_280_280/280.png\" alt=\"Shraddha Kaul\" width=\"280\" height=\"280\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>I am a 27-year-old Indian based in London and I married my childhood sweetheart a couple of years ago. In spite of the Indian tradition of taking your husband\u2019s surname I chose to keep my maiden name for two key reasons. First, it was easier professionally. I work in public relations and communications, and have been a journalist in the past. I wanted to make sure that I was still tied to my work by name. Also, my name is tied up with lots of public records and social media profiles, so it just gets complicated to change it. My husband and family were also supportive of this decision.</p> <p>Second, I am a big believer in breaking from tradition. I don\u2019t believe that we should behave in a certain way just because we\u2019ve always behaved that way. Instead, I prefer to come up with new concepts and encourage change. After all, we live in a very different world now and even traditional concepts in India, such as arranged marriage, are changing. </p> <p>I have friends who argued that taking your partner\u2019s name is a sign of commitment to them but I strongly disagree with this. As long as you stand by your partner through the good and bad that\u2019s a stronger measure of commitment and loyalty than just changing your surname.</p> <h2>Fabien Strawbridge, 40, from London: My name is not my identity but my dad\u2019s</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"9c749677c95b4552e941402aee7454924a3d8f9f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9c749677c95b4552e941402aee7454924a3d8f9f/0_0_280_280/280.png\" alt=\"Fabien Strawbridge\" width=\"280\" height=\"280\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>I\u2019m in a gay marriage, and chose to take my husband\u2019s surname, simply because it made our financial arrangements easier to navigate. I was also pleased to lose my original surname because I am half Chinese and my surname \u201cHo\u201d is really short. This means that often when I fill out forms people think the name section is incomplete or I\u2019ve spelt it wrong. </p> <p>I have been able to change everything except my French passport (I am from France) because the French law doesn\u2019t recognise surname changes, under gay marriage. I did feel a little bit sad losing my surname but it felt like the right decision. I have always felt that my name is not part of my identity, more my dad\u2019s, and my relationship with him is not close enough to feel part of my own identity. I felt sad because my name stops with me, and I was my parents\u2019 only child. One of the big reasons I changed my name was because it would be easier if we had children though. It was for practical reasons rather than romantic ones.</p>",

It was first identified as a problem in Bangladesh in 1987, and concentration levels in some places exceed 50 milligrammes per litre (mg/l) \u2013 way beyond the maximum level recommended by the World Health Organisation of 10 mg/l. <br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/apr/06/millions-of-people-in-bangladesh-still-drinking-arsenic-laced-water\">Millions of people in Bangladesh still drinking arsenic-laced water</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Each year, <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2016/04/06/bangladesh-20-million-drink-arsenic-laced-water\" rel=\"nofollow\">an estimated 43,000 people</a> die from arsenic poisoning in the country. The government has taken a number of steps and made policies to try to address the problem. But <a href=\"http://www.unicef.org/bangladesh/Towards_an_arsenic_safe_environ_summary(english)_22Mar2010.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">despite a country-wide campaign and social mobilisation activities by the government and NGOs</a> (pdf), knowledge and awareness levels among communities remain far below expectations.</p> <p>We know that there are cheap and potentially life-saving solutions to this problem. What we need to do now is promote these solutions, and increase access to them.</p> <h2>An invisible problem </h2> <p>Arsenic doesn\u2019t change the taste or colour of water so the first problem we encounter is making people understand that it is present in their community.</p> <p>From skin lesions, stomach cramps, diarrhoea and vomiting blood, to cancers of the bladder, lungs, skin and kidneys, the symptoms and effects of arsenic poisoning are debilitating and palpable. But without a proper diagnosis, often people do not know whether they are suffering from typical diseases or ones caused by long-term exposure to arsenic. </p> <p>It is even more difficult, therefore, to make people realise that prolonged contact with arsenic-contaminated water may cause illness or even death. Liza Akhter, a 21-year-old girl in Bagerhat District, south-west Bangladesh, said to one of my colleagues: \u201cThe thing about arsenic is you get poisoned slowly, so you don\u2019t know who has been affected around you already. Arsenic kills you every day, slowly.\u201d</p> <p>It is the poorest who face the biggest problems and those suffering from the symptoms of arsenic poisoning often find themselves in a vicious circle. Even though they may be suffering from multiple debilitating diseases, they often cannot afford to get treated.<strong> </strong>Many do not have enough land to install a water point so they are reliant on community points or the traditional untreated shallow tube wells. Often the roof of their home is not strong enough to support a rainwater harvesting system.</p> <p>Those who are better off are more involved in the decision-making process and therefore have more control over where water is distributed. Very often, they can afford to install deep tube wells on their own land and access safe sources of water below the contamination levels.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/gallery/2015/nov/13/polluting-the-worlds-water-in-pictures\">Polluting the world's water \u2013 in pictures</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>So what can be done?</h2> <p>In affected areas Practical Action has been working to educate people about the symptoms of arsenic poisoning. We have provided testing kits so that people can check if their water supply is contaminated and, if need be, install arsenic-removal systems or look into alternative safe water supplies.</p> <p>Arsenic removal systems, where contaminated water if filtered through four chambers, are one available option. Due to a lack of testing systems, however, households don\u2019t often know whether the removal system is working properly. We also find that the distribution of these filters is usually done in an ad hoc manner through government projects or by NGOs. </p> <p>The distribution of arsenic removal systems should be linked with suppliers to ensure post-installation services for repairing, replacing and changing the filter for long-term sustainability. Proper pricing plans are also essential for running a community-managed water point sustainably, and ensuring they are not abandoned due to financial problems. </p> <p>Rainwater harvesting does offer an alternative, but a lack of rain and the deterioration of water quality and taste during the dry season make it less popular. Usually, the equipment is not cleaned properly before the monsoon season which means that the water can become contaminated, causing sickness and diarrhoea. Other alternative sources of water could be found through \u201cconjunctive use\u201d, where surface water is stored in a groundwater basin in wet years, and withdrawn in dry years.</p> <p>Facilities to test water quality are also needed at home along with a national testing mechanism; science clubs in schools or laboratory facilities in colleges could even be explored for establishing such facilities.

Robert Sullivan, the FA\u2019s director of strategy, struggling under interrogation by Ian Lucas MP to communicate this point clearly, did manage to say that Allardyce only appeared to tell the undercover reporters, who were posing as investors while secretly filming the then England manager, what the rules on third-party ownership are in England.</p> <p>Sullivan said Allardyce\u2019s advice to them on how to \u201cget round\u201d the rules, which forbid investors to own a share in the \u201ceconomic rights\u201d of players, was to \u201cextinguish the ownership of the player\u201d. That means an English club has to buy a player outright from whoever owns his rights, and Allardyce even explained in the sting that when he was managing West Ham United the club bought outright Enner Valencia, whose rights had previously been owned by investors. \u201c[Allardyce] said you can\u2019t have third\u2011party ownership,\u201d Sullivan told Lucas MP. \u201cHis statement was a correct statement of the law.\u201d</p> <p>Lucas seemed not to hear this and carried on regardless, maintaining that for Allardyce to have advised on \u201cgetting round third-party ownership rules\u201d surely constituted gross misconduct, and therefore he should not have received a pay-off.</p> <p>Damian Collins actually read out in parliamentary session the text of tweets from the Crystal Palace striker Jason Puncheon, made in February 2014, which the player quickly deleted. Now it can for ever be reported, with parliamentary privilege preventing Warnock taking action to prevent it, that Puncheon had accused Warnock of being \u201ccrooked\u201d and of having players \u201cpay him to get in the team\u201d \u2013 claims strongly denied by the now Cardiff manager. Collins accused the FA of failing to investigate these claims rigorously, and instead Puncheon himself was fined \u00a315,000 by an FA commission.</p> <p>Yet Collins told the Guardian that he was unaware before using parliamentary privilege for this purpose, that Puncheon had publicly withdrawn those allegations, on Twitter, on 18 February 2014, days after first making them, said they were \u201cunfounded\u201d and apologised to Warnock. In fact he admitted the charge of improper conduct, and publishing \u201cunfounded allegations of dishonesty\u201d about Warnock.

He added: \u201cIf anyone had asked me the truth before publication, I would have pointed them to the FA website, where the facts are easily accessible.\u201d</p> <p>However, Collins nevertheless defended this use of parliamentary privilege, saying it was valid to ask if the FA had investigated, despite Puncheon having withdrawn the comments, because the allegations were \u201cvery specific\u201d, and there might have been something in them.</p> <p>For a committee determined to harangue the governing body of the national sport for a lack of rigour, this was not the MPs\u2019 finest two hours.</p>",

Which is true.<br></li> <li>If the government had not welched on the deal, the Adler would have come into the country with the <strong>lowest possible rating</strong>. </li> <li>Leyonhjelm still wants the ban lifted. He believes the Adler should be in the lowest category \u2013 which would make it most accessible.</li> <li>Labor thinks the ban should stay in place but have not committed so far to whether it should be let in by state and feds. </li> <li>I am seeking an answer from the government on which category the Adler should be in. </li> </ul> <p>So there are two issues:</p> <ol> <li>Should the Adler be allowed in at all?</li> <li>If so, what category should it be in?</li> </ol> <p>This has allowed many straw men to flourish.</p> <p>The National Firearms Agreement \u2013 or the Howard gun laws \u2013 will still be in place, no matter what the outcome for the Adler. <strong>Because this is the framework for the gun laws.</strong></p> <p>This means that the government can say rightly they are still committed to the Howard gun laws.</p> <p>But if the Adler is allowed in on the lowest category \u2013 as Leyonhjelm wants \u2013 there will be a more lethal weapon available to ordinary shooters.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-10-18T05:47:41.842Z\">at 6.47am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5805a37de4b0cd26ff71e324\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/paul-karp\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-18T04:23:51.656Z\">5.23am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>AHRC president <strong>Gillian Triggs</strong> is being asked about <a href=\"http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/rda1975202/s18c.html\">complaints made under s18C of the Racial Discrimination Act</a> in Senate estimates.<br></p> <p>Triggs notes that <a href=\"http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/rda1975202/s18d.html\">s18D provides an exemptions</a> for works that are done reasonably and in good faith.

What that meant was that, in the views of many law enforcement officials,<strong> the 1996 National Firearms Agreement</strong>, <strong>John Howard\u2019s</strong> gun laws if you like, had not kept up with technology. </p> <p>There was a need for the Council of Australian Police Ministers, justice ministers, the law, crime and community safety council to consider this matter and the commonwealth has sought for them to reach consensus and reclassify these lever-action guns. </p> <p>Because there had been a failure to reach that consensus, the government imposed a ban on importing lever-action shotguns of more than five rounds. So that was not designed to weaken or vary John Howard\u2019s gun laws. </p> <p>It was to hold the ring and prevent the lever-action guns of that capacity to be imported at all. That ban had a 12-month duration. When it came up for expiry, it was renewed.

It seemed like a good idea at the time but, after the election, the government benches were whittled back to a one seat majority. </p> <p>The two bills would establish a Australian Building Construction Commission and regulate registered organisations, ie unions. Today the first bill returns to the house, in a neat two-step following <strong>Bill Shorten\u2019s</strong> endorsement of former Health Services Union official <strong>Kimberley Kitching </strong>and an outbreak of factional farnarkling. </p> <p>In an interview with <strong>Fran Kelly</strong>, Turnbull has, on the one hand, attacked union thuggery in the CFMEU and, on the other, endorsed the bills as a great thing for the health of unions. </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This is not anti-union. This is not union busting. If the Labor party were to support this legislation, they would build public confidence in the unions, because the unions would be run in accordance with the law.</p> </blockquote> <p>Kelly asks, why not get the Australian Securities and Investment Commission to regulate unions as they do the banks? Why bust unions and not banks? Turnbull says the government is doing lots on the bank front and now they are doing lots on the union front. He is an equal opportunity regulator.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> Right across the board, what we\u2019re doing is addressing the issues that have been raised and that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing in the industrial relations field too.<br></p> </blockquote> <p>Overnight, you might have seen <strong>David Leyonhjelm</strong> has raised the prospect of horse trading over the ABCC bill. He wants a ban lifted on the importation of the Adler shotgun. </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The regulation of firearms is dealt with by Coag in effect, by states and territories and the commonwealth working together and so the importation <strong>ban on the lever-action Adler shotgun, over more than five rounds,</strong> was introduced and has been maintained because of a failure to date of that state and territory group to reach a resolution on it. </p> <p>So it is a collaborative effort. But I want to stress to you ... we have among the most, if not the most rigorous laws on the regulation of firearms in the world. It\u2019s one of the great achievements of <strong>John Howard</strong>.</p> </blockquote> <p>Fran: The world\u2019s leading human rights body is accusing your government, our government, of torture. You need to respond to that, don\u2019t you?</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Well, I reject that claim totally, it is absolutely false ... And I just note that the minister, Mr Dutton, offered to go onto to the Four Corners program and be interviewed live to deal with those allegations and that offer was rejected.</p> </blockquote> <p>Fran played some audio of one of the articulate children on the program last night.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We\u2019ve heard from this young lady and it is, it is a ... It is a very sad story that she tells. But, you know, there are 1,200 people, many of them young women too, no doubt, from whom we can never hear, because they drowned at sea under the Labor party\u2019s reckless failure to keep our borders safe.</p> </blockquote> <p>Turnbull says the government is negotiating with other countries but he accuses \u201cmany people in Australia\u201d of telling refugees to hold out in the hope of coming to Australia. </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I know that\u2019s a tough policy. I know that is hard. But the alternative is what we had under Labor \u2013 50,000 unauthorised arrivals and 1,200 voices that were silenced, that cannot go on Four Corners, that cannot talk on Radio National because they drowned at sea.</p> </blockquote> <p>On same-sex marriage, Turnbull says there was a still a chance the Senate could pass the bill, in spite of what \u201cyour fellow distinguished journalist, <strong>Katharine Murphy</strong>, from the Guardian said at a press conference.</p> <p>Q: You think there\u2019s still a chance it will pass?</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Of course. Of course ...</p> </blockquote> <p>Arguments ensue on the merits of the plebiscite ...</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><strong>It is a perfectly reasonable argument to say this is not consistent with our parliamentary tradition.</strong> But the fact is it is perfectly democratic. It is a proposition that we took to the election. We won the election ... Why wouldn\u2019t we grab this opportunity and say, \u201cLook, it may not be the perfect way of resolving the matter from your point of view but grab it, it will be carried, it will be done.\u201d Let\u2019s get on with it.</p> </blockquote> <p>Right, now that we are done with the War and Peace of first posts, I am @gabriellechan on the Twits, @mpbowers has some wonderful pics from the house games this morning. </p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-10-17T21:47:52.920Z\">at 10.47pm BST</time></p>  </div>",
  "<p>Margaret Thatcher has narrowly beaten David Cameron to be named the worst prime minister of the past 100 years by historical writers.</p> <p>The Historical Writers\u2019 Association surveyed its membership on their views of the 19 prime ministers who have led the UK since 1916, in advance both of this year\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.harrogateinternationalfestivals.com\">Harrogate History festival</a> later this week, and Theresa May\u2019s 100th day in office on 22 October. Thatcher, who died in 2013, came in first with 24% of the vote, followed by Cameron (22%) and Neville Chamberlain (17%).</p> <p>Authors singled out Thatcher\u2019s attitude to society as a chief problem with her premiership. \u201cShe destroyed too many good things in society, and created too many bad ones, then left a social and moral vacuum in which the selfishly rich and unimaginatively fortunate could too easily destroy still more of what they don\u2019t need and can\u2019t see that everyone else does need,\u201d said the writer Emma Darwin.</p> <p>\u201cThatcher made the idea of society, in the sense of a community that cares for all its members and accepts the premise that people need support and should not be stigmatised for it, an anathema,\u201d wrote historical novelist Catherine Hokin in her response. \u201cIt is easy to demonise politicians and resort to ad hominem rather than policy attacks, but Thatcher encouraged the worst behaviour across all aspects of society and we are still reaping her poisoned harvest.\u201d</p> <p>But Paddy Ashdown, former leader of the Liberal Democrats, begged to differ: \u201cI disagreed with Mrs Thatcher, I fought her all the way. But I thought she was a great and necessary destroyer. Some of those old structures she pulled down had to be pulled down, but what she wasn\u2019t was a builder. </p> <p>\u201cOddly enough, this will offend some, I put her down as one of the most successful PMs of all time, not because I agreed with her, but because she laid out her stall and she achieved it, and Britain in many ways was stronger afterwards \u2013 although in many ways it was also weaker, particularly our sense of communities,\u201d said Ashdown, who will speak at the festival later this week about his latest book, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/16/paddy-ashdown-i-turned-to-my-wife-and-said-its-not-our-country-any-more\">Game of Spies.</a></p> <p>Former HWA chair Manda Scott said she voted for Thatcher for reasons of \u201cneoliberalism, de-industrialisation, free-market ideology, Scottish poll tax, selling council houses and failing to act on early stages of global warming\u201d, while the historical crime writer DE Meredith said that Thatcher \u201cspawned a terrible lack of compassion at the heart of British politics, which we still live with today\u201d, pointing in particular to her quote: \u201cThere\u2019s no such thing as society.\u201d<br></p> <p>Tony Blair was in fourth place, with 11% of the vote, followed by Gordon Brown and Edward Heath with 8% each. Anthony Eden, Herbert Henry Asquith and Andrew Bonar Law were all tied, with 2% of the vote. The remaining 10 PMs were not nominated by any of the 45 writers who responded to the survey.</p> <p>According to Ashdown, the second-placed Cameron was \u201cone of the most dangerous prime ministers we\u2019ve had, not because he\u2019s not a decent man, he\u2019s a very decent man, but because he just didn\u2019t think, in his casual Eton-bred insouciance, about taking this huge and vitally important decision for Britain\u201d.</p> <p>Others agreed with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/16/paddy-ashdown-i-turned-to-my-wife-and-said-its-not-our-country-any-more\">politician turned writer\u2019s</a> assessment of the former PM. \u201cDavid Cameron is a mediocrity who\u2019s single-handedly brought on the UK\u2019s biggest crisis in 75 years,\u201d said the author Tom Harper, programming chair of the Harrogate History festival, which will take place from 20-23 October. \u201cNeville Chamberlain had to contend with Hitler, Eden with Nasser: Cameron couldn\u2019t see off Nigel Farage.\u201d </p> <p>\u201cHe gambled with the country\u2019s future prosperity and lost,\u201d added novelist Angus Donald. \u201cThen ran from the battlefield leaving the rest of us to pick up the pieces.\u201d</p> <p> But the third-placed Chamberlain was Ashdown\u2019s personal choice for the \u201cworst prime minister\u201d label. \u201cI think Chamberlain could have personally prevented the second world war,\u201d said Ashdown. \u201cHe was certainly warned by the German opposition what Hitler was and he chose to ignore it, and the consequence was eight million people dead. I don\u2019t blame him for those deaths but I remain of the view that if he\u2019d taken the right decision, as he was encouraged to when Hitler invaded Czechoslovakia, the second world war would not have happened.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>A landmark case due to be heard by the high court in Istanbul over alleged crimes committed by Israel during the 2010 aid flotilla to Gaza could be dropped as a result of a bilateral agreement signed in June.</p> <p>The Turkish court is expected to hold a hearing on Wednesday aimed at holding four Israeli generals to account for the alleged assault and unlawful detention of more than 700 activists. They were aboard a fleet of boats attempting to break Israel\u2019s blockade of Gaza in May 2010. The case against the generals is due to be heard in absentia.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>However, the activists fear the judge will dismiss the case following a <a href=\"http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/1.727526\">deal reached between Israel and Turkey</a> in the summer to restore diplomatic relations, which broke off following the violent interception of the flotilla.<br></p> <p>Under the deal, Israel agreed to make an ex gratia payment of $20m (\u00a316m) to Turkey to compensate the families of 10 activists who were killed by Israeli forces aboard the flotilla\u2019s lead ship, the Mavi Marmara.<br></p> <p>The agreement specified that the two countries \u201cdo not attribute legal or other liability to the other side or its agents, and agree that this understanding will not be construed as an admittance of or the placing of criminal or civil liability on any side or its agents\u201d.<br></p> <p>The deal constituted \u201cfull release from any liability of Israel, its agents and citizens with respect to any and all claims, civil or criminal, that have been or will be filed against them in Turkey, direct or indirect, by the Republic of Turkey or Turkish real and legal persons, in relation to the flotilla incident\u201d.<br></p> <p>Israeli forces <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/may/31/israel-kills-activists-flotilla-gaza\">stormed the Mavi Marmara</a> and five other ships in May 2010 to prevent them reaching Gaza, killing 10 people and injuring many more. The incident triggered international condemnation and a diplomatic crisis between Turkey and Israel.<br></p> <p>The flotilla had set sail from Turkey, and nine of the 10 dead activists were Turkish. Its cargo included medical supplies, construction materials and paper for Gaza schools. Israel warned it would prevent the ships breaking its blockade on Gaza.<br></p> <p>A <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/sep/01/un-investigation-backs-israel-blockade-gaza\">United Nations investigation</a> later backed Israel\u2019s naval blockade of Gaza as legal but said its military assault on the flotilla was \u201cexcessive and unreasonable\u201d.<br></p> <p>In the case due to be heard in Istanbul this week, 740 activists from 37 countries \u2013 including a number from the UK \u2013 are being represented. The court has heard testimony over the past 18 months, and the judge is now due to decide how to proceed.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Alexandra Lort Phillips, a British activist who testified in earlier court hearings in Istanbul, said: \u201cThe attack on the ships of the flotilla was a shocking event \u2026 The actions of Israel were illegal, plain and simple.\u201d<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>She said the legal process was now at risk of being \u201cpolitically hijacked\u201d, adding: \u201cIt is deeply upsetting. The legal process should not fall victim to power politics.\u201d<br></p> <p>Ahsan Shamruk, another British activist, said he was shot in the head and stomach and left to die in the lethal military assault on the flotilla. \u201cI am still suffering from nightmares and many sleepless nights. I have permanent ear nerve damage and my eyesight has drastically deteriorated. Those responsible must be held to account for this criminal act.\u201d<br></p> <p>The deal between Israel and Turkey was not enforceable as a matter of international law and under the European convention on human rights, said Rodney Dixon, a British QC who is part of the survivors\u2019 legal team.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u201cIt would be unlawful for the Turkish court to terminate the criminal case and deprive the victims of justice and their \u2018day in court\u2019 on account of an \u2018agreement\u2019 made by two states,\u201d he said.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u201cThe victims and the families of the deceased were not consulted nor involved at all in these dealings that directly impinge on their fundamental rights.\u201d<br></p> <p>Last week, an <a href=\"http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/israeli-minister-due-in-turkey-for-first-post-crisis-visit-official-.aspx?pageID=238&amp;nid=104783\">Israeli government minister visited Turkey</a> for the first time since 2010 in a sign of restored diplomatic relations.<br></p>",

My peers and I would think nothing of doing a couple of all-nighters a week to stay on top of it. The next morning at breakfast, we would exchange tales of our martyrdom \u2013 someone had stayed up for three days straight reading Crime and Punishment, another had moved into the library, toothbrush and all.</p> <p>This life shuddered to a halt when I suddenly became ill in the first term of my final year. I had glandular fever which, unbeknown to me then, had triggered <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/30/me-chronic-fatigue-syndrome-patients-suffer-put-off-treatments-our-research\">ME \u2013 a chronic, extremely debilitating disease</a>. As there was no way I could continue with my coursework, with the support of my GP I applied for a week\u2019s extension. It was denied by the university.</p> <p>So at a time when I should have been, under doctor\u2019s orders, resting, I dragged myself to the library. When I collapsed on the front quad one day, I knew I had to go home. There, as I became sicker, it was clear to me I wouldn\u2019t be able to go back to Oxford any time soon and would need a year out.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/oct/13/oxbridge-fails-persuade-state-teachers-send-pupils-interview\">Oxbridge fails to persuade state teachers to send pupils for interview</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Becoming suddenly ill was hard enough but my distress was increased by the university\u2019s reaction. A senior member of college staff tried twice on the phone to persuade me to go back the next term, as if I could simply make up my mind I was better and all would be well. It felt they did not believe I was ill; as if they thought I had something to gain from taking a year out, rather than losing a year of my life, in pain.</p> <p>Although I had seen several doctors at home in Yorkshire, one of whom had sent a medical note to my college, Wadham, to say I was too ill to continue, the college said this wasn\u2019t enough. Only the college doctor in Oxford could grant me a year off. This was standard college practice.</p> <p>After weeks of distressing negotiations, I was allowed to suspend my studies for a year \u2013 with conditions. I was not allowed anywhere on college grounds (where all my friends lived) for the year. Worse, in order to rejoin my course after a year, I would have to sit six hours of exams and achieve a 2:1 standard. These exams were only for sick students.</p> <p>ME is an illness where any kind of exertion \u2013 physical or mental \u2013 exacerbates symptoms. Doing extra exams on top of the huge quantity of revision I was expected to do would make me more ill, I knew. I put in a request to return without sitting exams but tutors said the papers were essential to prove that I could pass my finals. One said I needed to \u201ctoughen up\u201d.</p> <p>Eventually I bargained the college down to one three-hour exam. I spent two hours of it not knowing what to write but, somehow, I made it through.</p> <p>Oxford is an old, creakingly traditional institution. Its website boasts that it is the oldest university in the English-speaking world, and some of the language still in everyday use is archaic. Oxford\u2019s word for a year out of a degree is \u201crustication\u201d. It\u2019s from Latin (of course): \u201crus\u201d means countryside, and the word was first used when students were expelled by being sent to their family home in the country. Officially, the word \u201csuspension\u201d is used now, but tutors and students alike still call it \u201crustication\u201d. And it is more than just a word. This centuries-old attitude links being ill with being punished and seems to see those who need time off for health reasons as problem students to be banished and who have to prove themselves worthy before they are allowed back.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"147daee993627b8150de0948450a55dd0e599a3c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/147daee993627b8150de0948450a55dd0e599a3c/0_0_3072_2048/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The University of Oxford.

In some cases, students have been required to sit the equivalent of all their finals, and get a 2:1 in them, to rejoin their course.</p> <p>Last year, one student, Sophie Spector, at Balliol College, claimed she felt <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/educationnews/11655791/Oxford-forced-me-out-due-to-disabilities-student-claims.html\">forced to leave Oxford altogether </a>because of these kinds of exams, a case human rights lawyer Chris Fry described as \u201cone of the more extreme examples of discrimination I have seen\u201d.</p> <p>In contrast with many universities, the vast majority of marks at Oxford are awarded based on exams sat at the end. Finals can be upwards of 30 hours of exams and are a test of mental and physical stamina as much as academic skills and knowledge. The arguments against changing the system are always the same \u2013 to protect the integrity of the course; the \u201cunique\u201d Oxford experience. But intellectual rigour has been confused with physical or mental fitness.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"0527cc3fe11b0999d37ebfac6ca548379a96eea4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0527cc3fe11b0999d37ebfac6ca548379a96eea4/77_43_500_500/500.jpg\" alt=\"Sophie Spector\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sophie Spector says she felt forced to leave Balliol College after becoming ill</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: None</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I spoke to several others who had been through \u201crustication\u201d. One, who graduated in 2015, had been suffering mental health problems that led to her self-harming. Letters from her college, seen by the Guardian, refer to her \u201cbehaviour\u201d at the time as \u201cserious misconduct\u201d. One referred to university regulations and told her that she was being suspended on disciplinary as well as medical grounds. She was not permitted to use college facilities, including \u201ccommon rooms, the computing room, the dining hall, the lodge, the library and the college\u2019s accommodation\u201d.</p> <p>She says: \u201cAt no point did I feel the main consideration was for my wellbeing. Rather than focus on sorting out my problems, I spent the year trying to recover from the trauma of having rusticated. My doctor told me a senior member of my college had described me as a \u2018freak\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>A recent history graduate summed up her feelings after asking for a year off as \u201chumiliated\u201d. She was told in a letter that she was not allowed to go into her college without written permission during her suspension \u201cto ensure that students on course are not disrupted\u201d. She was expected to sit two exam papers and achieve a mark of 60% before she could return. \u201cBasically the whole process felt punitive, like I was being subjected to it because I had misbehaved.\u201d</p> <p>One college, <a href=\"http://oxfordstudent.com/2012/01/12/magdalen-balls-up/\">Magdalen</a>, was criticised for forbidding \u201crusticated\u201d students from attending a college ball.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/oct/11/oxford-university-releases-sample-interview-questions\">Oxford University releases sample interview questions</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Many students are, thankfully, treated much better, but individual colleges are free to make many of their own rules, and students\u2019 experience can be largely determined by senior staff. If tutors have an appropriate understanding of illness and disability, students are well supported. But change in Oxford is slow. Even the university\u2019s own disability service, which I found helpful and supportive, cannot overrule the decisions of colleges in many cases.</p> <p>Oxford students have been campaigning for improved care of sick and suspended students for years. Recently there have been minor reforms \u2013 \u201csuspended\u201d students can now borrow from university libraries in their year out and retain access to their email. But this does not go nearly far enough.</p> <p>I put a comprehensive set of questions to the university covering the points made in this article. This was the response: \u201cSuspension of study is a rare but helpful measure used by all universities to support students. Most suspensions are either at the student\u2019s request or with their full agreement. We know it helps the overwhelming majority of students, who return to complete their courses successfully.</p> <p>\u201cSuspension is not something to be undertaken lightly, so colleges always make sure students explore every possible source of support before suspending. There is no question of students not being believed or supported when they experience difficulties. It is important that students only return when they are fully prepared to do so. In some cases, the assessment of fitness to return includes the setting of college exams.</p> <p>\u201cThe colleges are working in consultation with Oxford University student union on a common approach and discussing both access to college facilities during suspension and academic conditions for return to study.\u201d</p> <p>In the end, I graduated in 2015 with a first, very much in spite of the extra obstacles I had experienced. Although my health has improved with time and rest, I am still debilitated. I believe that if Oxford had handled my illness more sensitively, it would have aided my recovery.</p> <h2>What do other universities do?</h2> <p>How unusual is Nathalie Wright\u2019s experience? Education Guardian contacted 30 universities to find out about their procedures when a student needs time off for medical reasons \u2013 an \u201cinterruption\u201d or an \u201cabeyance\u201d, as it\u2019s usually called. The word \u201crustication\u201d seems confined to Oxford, Cambridge and Durham \u2013 and in most institutions a \u201csuspension\u201d is more likely to be the result of some sort of misdemeanour.</p> <p>We asked whether students were required to see an official \u201cuniversity doctor\u201d or specialist, in addition to their own GP, for proof that they were ill. The answer, from those that replied, was \u201cno\u201d \u2013 all said a family doctor\u2019s note was good enough.</p> <p>Most said students who took time off were welcome to use campus facilities or visit friends and attend social functions, with a few restrictions. When attendance was not feasible, \u201cvirtual\u201d access to libraries and virtual learning environments was often arranged.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/27/me-affects-four-times-women-men-chronic-fatigue-syndrome\">ME affects four times as many women as men.

The Cambridge spokesman said exams were sometimes set, but this was rare. \u201cIt\u2019s a welfare issue because we\u2019d want the student to be well cared for. We\u2019d want both student and college to be reassured they were ready to come back and finish their degree.\u201d</p> <p>But is it right to equate performance in an academic exam with mental or physical health and fitness to return to studying? \u201cDoing exams to prove you are fit is something I have never heard of and may be of little, if any, practical use,\u201d says Ruth Caleb, head of counselling at Brunel University and coordinator of the <a href=\"http://www.universitiesuk.ac.uk/about/Pages/mwbhe.aspx\">Mental Wellbeing in Higher Education working group</a>. \u201cMany mental and physical conditions, such as depression, anxiety, ME, Crohn\u2019s disease or irritable bowel syndrome, are fluctuating so a student might be fit at one point, then unfit, or less fit, at others.\u201d</p> <p>There is little if any guidance for universities on how best to look after students who need to take a break from their studies. However, most institutions, motivated by the wish to see students complete their course, offer extra support on their return. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/alicewoolley\"><strong>Alice Woolley</strong></a></p>",

  "<p>Buried in the 113 subsections and 12 schedules of the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/higher-education-and-research-bill\">2016 Higher Education and Research Bill</a> that is currently before parliament are massive constitutional changes that will undermine the autonomy and vigour of Britain\u2019s universities and its research base. The issues are complex, and involve perturbations of the difficult balance of power, democracy, expertise, and academic freedom that will seem intangible to many. But institutions and processes that have been of demonstrable value to this country for decades and, in some cases, centuries, will be significantly eroded if this bill passes through parliament unamended.</p> <p>As it stands the bill envisages far-reaching changes to the organisation of universities and research. It establishes the Teaching Excellence Framework (TEF), an assessment exercise based heavily on a variety of simple metrics with questionable relationships to teaching quality; it lowers the threshold that private providers must meet to become degree-awarding universities; and it will create a super-research council \u2013 UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) \u2013 led by a powerful chair and chief executive to oversee the near-totality of publicly funded research in the UK. Never before in the history of British science have so few individuals been been responsible for so much spending</p> <p>Of course, it is healthy to seek to review and improve how we do things, and the government has mandate to deliver manifesto commitments to introduce the TEF and the revamp of the research councils envisaged in the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/nurse-review-of-research-councils\">Nurse Review</a>. At the same time, it should be borne in mind that Britain is an established world-leader in research. We have an efficient system of oversight that delivers more high-impact research per pound invested than any other country. Our universities are also among the best \u2013 we have <a href=\"https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/2016/world-ranking#!/page/0/length/25/sort_by/rank_label/sort_order/asc/cols/rank_only\">ten institutions among the top fifty in the world</a>. </p> <p>Nor should it be forgotten that our research base and our universities are vital parts of the economic, political and cultural life blood of this country and have been for hundreds of years. But this bill, in its present form, threatens to undermine them both. </p> <p>The reputations of our universities and our research base are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/16/university-funding-brexit-eu-freedom-of-movement\">already under threat</a> because of the fallout from the EU referendum result, which is making the UK an unfriendlier place for overseas scholars and students, as well as cutting off access to an important stream of research funding and to a vibrant and well-developed ecosystem for collaborative work. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/16/university-funding-brexit-eu-freedom-of-movement\">Britain has a proud academic record. We must not let Brexit devalue it | David Willetts</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In such circumstances we need to think very carefully before making changes. </p> <p>Let me take the universities first. The Higher Education and Research Bill creates a powerful new body, the Office for Students (OfS) with the power to override university Royal Charters, and remove the right of institutions to award degrees or even to call themselves universities. All of this the OfS will be able to do without parliamentary scrutiny. The change is motivated by the government\u2019s desire to enable new providers to enter the market \u2013 which the bill makes easier than at present by lowering the threshold requirements \u2013 and to be able to regulate that market by excluding providers that don\u2019t perform to the required standard. </p> <p>There is sense in having this degree of flexibility \u2013 and existing institutions should welcome high-quality competition. But this bill is a blunt and dangerous instrument for enacting that policy because alongside the power granted to the OfS to control the very existence of universities, it confers unprecedented powers on the Secretary of State to give instruction on what courses universities may teach. To quote the bill directly, Part 1, Section 2 states that \u201cthe OfS must have regard to guidance given by the Secretary of State\u201d, guidance that \u201cmay be framed by reference to particular courses of study.\u201d</p> <p>While there are some safeguards in the bill to protect the freedom of universities to determine course content and methods of assessment, we should make no mistake: this is a new level of interference in university autonomy. It will have a chilling effect when combined with the power of the OfS to determine whether universities have the right to exist. The bill places undue power in the hands of government and erodes institutional autonomy and academic freedom. </p> <p>It may well be that Jo Johnson, the present minister for universities and science, does not envisage ever using these powers to direct universities in what they will teach, but this is bad law. Such power, once created, becomes open to misuse and we cannot simply proceed on trust. We need full protection of university autonomy to be built into the DNA of this bill.</p> <p>The powers granted by the Higher Education and Research bill are all the more worrying in light of recent government actions which have taken an authoritarian turn. At the Conservative Party conference the home secretary raised the possibility of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/05/government-faces-backlash-from-business-leaders-over-foreign-workers\">naming and shaming companies that hire overseas workers</a> \u2013 a message that was not lost on the university sector, even if it has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/oct/09/plan-to-force-firms-to-reveal-foreign-staff-numbers-abandoned\">now been abandoned</a> as a formal policy proposal. Then there was the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/07/lse-brexit-non-uk-experts-foreign-academics\">spat between the Foreign Office and the London School of Economics</a> about the exclusion of non-UK academics from work on the implications of Brexit, which was followed by news that the Department of Education will require any researcher using statistics from the National Pupil Database to <a href=\"http://schoolsweek.co.uk/academics-must-show-research-to-government-two-days-before-publishing-say-new-dfe-rules/\">submit work to them forty-eight hours before publication</a>. Further concern has been aroused by the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/news/ministers-hide-report-on-migrant-numbers-dv8dbj7cz\">government\u2019s attempt to bury its own report</a> showing that only a tiny fraction of overseas students abuse the terms of their student visas. </p> <p>For the sake of our democracy, we need a university sector that retains the independence to stand up for evidence and to stand up for academic freedom. This bill is a direct threat to the autonomy of our existing institutions and needs to be amended. The secretary of state should not be granted powers to guide the university curriculum. Decisions by the government-appointed OfS on whether an institution can continue to operate as a university should be subject to full parliamentary scrutiny. </p> <p>Part 3 of the Higher Education and Research Bill raises further disquiet about the governance of the UK research base. </p> <p>Over the past 100 years the UK has developed a complex and supple system of oversight \u2013 enshrined in legislation and in custom and practice \u2013 in which robust lines of communication operate across different levels, from researchers on the ground, through research council chiefs, and all the way up to the secretary of state. </p> <p>But this bill legislates for a downgrading of the research councils. They are no longer councils but committees. They will lose the protection of their Royal Charters. And their chief executives will not, <em>ex officio</em>, have a seat on the board of the powerful new over-arching council, UKRI. </p> <p>The bill does not even provide for the creation of an executive forum that would allow the heads of the new research committee to communicate the views of their researcher communities to the CEO of UKRI. Although a <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/higher-education-and-research-bill-uk-research-and-innovation\">supplementary document</a> published just last week by the Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) now envisages such a committee, the system of governance is significantly more top-down than before. </p> <p>Perhaps, as Sir Paul Nurse intends, the new arrangement will create a powerful voice for science at the heart of government (although UKRI board appointments have to be approved by the secretary of state), while freeing research committee heads from interactions with government that distract from the job of fostering research in their designated areas. That said, none of the present Research Council chiefs has complained about having a direct line of communication to the minister. Much will depend on the individuals involved in the new regime. </p> <p>Moreover, from before the middle of the last century science\u2019s influence in government has had multi-polar characteristics. Heads of autonomous funding councils, Whitehall chief scientists, learned societies, academics, and even campaign groups have together worked with, and sometimes against, government to protect the research base. This can never be the task of one or two individuals, yet the proposed arrangements invest a great deal of power in the chair and chief executive of UKRI.</p> <p>The concerns about weakening of important consultative mechanisms are amplified by the power the bill awards to the secretary of state to create and abolish new committees, and to add or subtract from the disciplinary fields that they are encouraged to support. According to the bill these changes can be made through statutory instruments that must be placed before parliament, but such instruments are used so frequently that that they <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://wonkhe.com/blogs/analysis-concerns-ukri-blueprint/\">typically receive little scrutiny</a>. </p> <p>Of course, the remit of UK research committees should always be kept under review. Research is a fast moving endeavour and it is right to ensure that decision-making can respond flexibly. But the authority granted by the bill to the secretary of state marks a turn against a long-standing practice of consultation with the expertise and experience of the research community. And while the present minister seems unlikely to be minded to misuse the new powers accorded by the bill, its formulation is open to future abuse. The bill should be amended to ensure adequate consultation and proper parliamentary scrutiny before any changes to research committee remits are enacted. </p> <p>It\u2019s not to late.

We reassure the people of Mosul that both the peshmerga and the Iraqi army will do everything not to cause any loss to the people and no revenge killing will take place.\u201d<br></p> \n<p>Lt Gen Stephen Townsend, the commander of US military operations against Isis, said in a statement: \u201cThis operation to regain control of Iraq\u2019s second-largest city will likely continue for weeks, possibly longer. Iraq is supported by a wide range of coalition capabilities, including air support, artillery, intelligence, advisers and forward air controllers.</p> \n<p> \u201cBut to be clear, the thousands of ground combat forces who will liberate Mosul are all Iraqis.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u201cEveryone is staying at home because we don\u2019t know what else to do. Daesh are mostly moving around on motorbike and have small and heavy guns,\u201d said Abu Mohammed, a 35 year-old in the east Mosul. \u201cThe planes started bombing Mosul around one in the morning today and they are in the sky constantly and occasionally striking targets.\u201d<br></p> \n<p>\u201cDaesh are moving into civilian houses and mixing with the population. For example Daesh has placed a large depot of IED\u2019s in a house next to my cousin\u2019s house. I begged him to leave his house and bring his family to stay with me as the house could be targeted by coalition. He refused and said: Whatever destiny brings,\u201d said Mohammed (not his real name).</p> \n<p>Another resident, Abu Sabra, aged 22, said: \u201cDaesh is collecting tires in the city in order to burn them at Bashiqa junction to prevent the planes from targeting them.\u201d</p> \n<p>He added that the jihadists had lined up shipping containers along the sides of the roads in Mosul.</p> \n<p>\u201cThere is no money and even though the food is cheap we can not buy. This evening we only had fried potatoes,\u201d Abu Sabra said. He said Isis was shooting anyone seen trying to flee Mosul, but there were growing signs of potential resistance to Isis from inside the city.</p> \n<p>\u201cI can see sign that people want to resist Daesh because they have had enough. In my neighborhood , some people openly use their mobile phones which is forbidden. Others who still have their guns hidden, are preparing to join the peshmerga or the Iraqi army when they enter the city to fight Daesh.\u201d<br></p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/17/isis-mosul-offensive-iraq-islamic-militancy\">If the Mosul offensive is a success, what could this mean for Isis?</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The UN high commissioner for refugees (UNHCR) <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-iraq-mosul-un-idUSKBN12H11N\">warned that up to 100,000 Iraqis</a> may flee to Syria and Turkey to escape the battle for Mosul, and the organisation appealed for an additional $61m (\u00a350m) to provide tents, camps, winter items and stoves for displaced people inside Iraq and new refugees needing shelter in the two neighbouring countries.</p> \n<p>Josh Earnest, the White House spokesman, said the US had contributed more than $1bn since 2014 to address the humanitarian situation. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of investment that\u2019s gone into this effort in advance of the operation and I think that will begin to pay dividends as we make progress against Isil in Mosul,\u201d he said. \u201cThere has been an intense focus on making sure that when Isil is cleared from communities in Iraq there is a clear strategy for stabilising those communities.\u201d<br></p> \n<p>The Pentagon said seven million leaflets would be dropped over Mosul in the coming 48 hours advising civilians to stay in their homes and advising them on how to stay as safe as possible in the course of the looming battle.</p> \n<p>The start of the offensive, which has been months in the planning, was announced in an address on state television by Iraq\u2019s prime minister in the early hours of Monday morning.

If they go into Mosul ... I would expect the negative reaction will be tremendous and if there are mass killings, it could end up being a bonanza for violent extremists, and recruitment for Daesh.

  "<p>Last October, video game developer Playground Games sent six staff members from its studio in Leamington Spa to a tiny town 120 miles south-west of Sydney called Braidwood, New South Wales. Armed with a custom built 12K-resolution camera worth tens of thousands of pounds, they weren\u2019t there to capture the scenery or film movie sequences with a cast of actors. They were there to record the sky.</p> <p>Released in September, Forza Horizon 3 is widely credited as one of the most visually impressive console games ever made. A driving simulation based in and around a fictitious car festival, the game gives players hundreds of miles of accurately modelled Australian scenery to explore, from dense rain forests to sun-bleached outback wastelands.</p> <p>There are races to enter, challenges to attempt and hundreds of new vehicles to unlock, but it\u2019s the developer\u2019s obsession with detail that has really stood out. The game provides a neat indication of where real-world simulation is heading in this ever-more graphically ambitious industry. And it all starts with those skies.</p> <p>If you\u2019ve played Forza Horizon 3, you will have noticed them: dramatic, ever-changing panoramas of cloud, punctured by light rays and accompanied by evolving weather patterns.</p> <p>For the previous game in the series, Playground did what most studios do: they created a bunch of cloud models, then lit and rotated in them in various ways to suggest a seemingly changeable skyscape. For the third title though, the art team had a new idea: what about taking a high resolution camera, pointing it at the sky and capturing the whole expanse over many hours, as a detailed time-lapse sequence. </p> <p>For a while, it was just that \u2013 a crazy idea. Until they tried it.</p> <p>\u201cWe shot a pre-production test here in Leamington Spa, just sitting in a field,\u201d explains the lead lighting artist, Jamie Wood. \u201cAnd what we got from it, frame by frame \u2026 there was so much more nuance to the lighting changes. In just an hour, we had more variety than the whole of the system we used last time.\u201d</p> <p>So the plan was hatched to send a team out to Australia to capture the country\u2019s very specific lighting, weather and cloud formation patterns. It wasn\u2019t just about replicating pretty cloud shapes: in the Forza series, as well as a lot of modern video games, the game\u2019s lighting effects are physics-based.</p> <p>In other words, the game simulates a realistic sun. All the variations in light and shadow that the player sees in the world are calculated in real-time, based on how light is dispersed and how it is occluded by objects between the source and the surface; whether that\u2019s a rain cloud blocking the light, or buildings casting shadows across the road. And the direction and length of those shadows is calculated based on the real-world light direction. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"afda736955642cdd22ef80c5c91dbf673ea61cc2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/afda736955642cdd22ef80c5c91dbf673ea61cc2/0_275_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Playground Games shot the Australian sky through the summer, in total recording 30 24-hour periods\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Playground Games shot the Australian sky through the summer, in total recording 30 24-hour periods.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sean Murray/www.seanmurray.com.au</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIt was quite a romantic idea,\u201d says Wood. \u201cTo take the research footage of the light out there and bring that into the studio and project it into the game; to give players the experience of those cloud scapes and how that lights the world. But it was a very risky concept, with a lot of sensible push-back internally, we were thinking: should we really do this?\u201d</p> <p>For a start, the creative director, Ralph Fulton, had to weigh up the practicalities of sending experienced staff into the Australian bush for several weeks of expensive development time. </p> <p>\u201cI mean, how do you insure them for something like that?\u201d Fulton said. </p> <p>And then there were the logistics and uncertainties of a reasonably unprecedented shoot. Wood said: \u201cDuring our two year development period we only had one window to capture an Australian summer. We had to plan so much in ahead.\u201d</p> <p>Eventually, three teams of two carried out the shooting process, beginning in October 2015, and running throughout the Australian summer. Each team headed out into the countryside near Braidwood, set up a camp, pointed the camera at the sky and waited as it took thousands of high-resolution images over 24-hour periods. </p> <p>\u201cThe skies are captures as an interpolated series of frames, like a movie but with shorter increments,\u201d says Wood. \u201cPer frame, we derive an image-based specular cue for reflections and also a diffuse light source. So whatever the sky\u2019s doing, whether it\u2019s got really sharp shadows or its very hazy, it will be picked up frame by frame.\u201d</p> <p>But travel to the other side of the world? Why not use the Leamington test footage? \u201cThe heat in Australia generates a lot of different clouds that we don\u2019t tend to see here,\u201d says Wood. \u201cYou have a lot of big cumulonimbus and amble clouds. But it\u2019s more to do with the arc of the Sun, the timings of sunsets and how dark it gets at night. </p> <p>\u201cBecause the sun actually drops much lower below the horizon in Australia in summer than it does here, you get these pitch black nights and very quick dramatic sunsets \u2013 and the sun will be much higher in the sky during the day. We took light probes and captured all that data - we didn\u2019t have to guess what the light would be like.\u201d</p> <p>All of this is visible in the game. Whizzing along the cliffs beside Byron Bay at sunset, the sky quickly drops from broad daylight to almost hallucinogenic orange, the strong midday sun above Surfer\u2019s Paradise, cutting great sharp shadows into the road \u2013 it all adds to the visual grandeur. </p> <p>But in this era of HDR visuals, where subtle gradients of light are detectable, some of the most impressive effects in modern games will come from how light is treated when it hits and reflects off objects. \u201cForza Horizon 3 uses a voxel-based global illumination system to calculate light bounces in real-time,\u201d says Fulton. \u201cThis system uses the HDR sky, other light sources and offline-generated occlusion data to work out which surfaces the light bounces onto. </p> <p>\u201cFor an easy way to see the impact that bounced light has on a scene, look at locations with complex shadows like the entrance to a cave or crevices in a rock formation \u2013 in Forza Horizon 2, those shadows would have had a single colour value which meant the shadow would be uniform everywhere there was no direct light. In Forza Horizon 3, we calculate how light \u2013 and hence colour \u2013 bounces into partially occluded areas so shadows have a much higher variation in darkness and colour. The depths of a tunnel, with no direct and minimal indirect light, will be almost black; whereas the edges of shadow will bleed naturally from dark to light based on indirect bounced light.\u201d</p> <p>In the end, the team caught 30-days worth of 24-hour sky shoots, which are used to create the game\u2019s naturalistically evolving skyscape. In free roam mode, the game will effectively \u201cplay\u201d a full day\u2019s footage across the game sky, the data streamed in, on the fly, from the hard-drive. \u201cIf you sit in the same place, you\u2019ll see the sky elapse as it did in real life,\u201d says Fulton. The only difference is, in the game, the footage is sped up so that a Horizon day doesn\u2019t last 24-hours. </p> <p>\u201cOne of the knock on effects of this system was that it made our days much longer than in Forza Horizon 2\u201d says Fulton. \u201cSpeeding up time beyond a certain point makes the cloud movement look ludicrous. I think that benefits the game \u2013 sunsets are longer, sunrises are longer, but we mitigate the slower passage of time by using in-game events \u2013 a cutscene, the start of a race etc \u2013 to jump around a bit and prevent monotony.\u201d</p> <p>The weather system is connected too, so when dark clouds roll in, the rain starts on cue, altering the surface feel. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"18728c59969652c417bf27f028384c329251a19f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/18728c59969652c417bf27f028384c329251a19f/34_0_3600_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"forza horizon 3\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lightning makes all the difference.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Microsoft</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cPeople have asked us, why are you so obsessed with the sky?\u201d says Fulton. \u201cWell, it\u2019s a massive part of our frame. In a driving game you have sky, car, terrain, road. But it\u2019s more than that: the sky is the lightsource, so everything in the world benefits from a realistic system.</p> <p>\u201cThrough the detail of the light and the reflections, the cars, the leaves on the trees, the tarmac, all of them benefit from the much higher detail lighting data that\u2019s coming from the sky. So the whole scene looks better - not just the blue bit at the top.\u201d</p> <p>The teams shot for three weeks, a physically demanding task that required camping out with the cameras, which would get clogged with dust and grit. </p> <p>\u201cWe needed to clean the lenses every half an hour, and the light sensors after every shoot,\u201d says Wood. \u201cWe also needed to change the lenses every sun rise and sunset. Because we were capturing the whole dynamic range of the Sun, once it dropped away, we\u2019d need a more sensitive camera set-up for night.\u201d </p> <p>There was also the local wildlife to contend with, including unidentifiable but scary-looking spiders climbing into the camera cases, and other terrifying fauna. </p> <p>Wood said: \u201cSomething kept landing on my arm during one shoot, it was a fly the size of a mouse. One of the locals saw it on me and said, \u2018whoa, that thing is not your friend, you need to get that off right now\u2019\u201d.</p> <p>The vagaries of the weather also added to the challenge. \u201cYou\u2019re at the mercy of what the sky is doing that given day,\u201d says Fulton. \u201cThere was a lot of amateur meteorology going on, trying to predict the periods we should be out in the field.</p> <p>\u201cWe had a list of all the skies we needed for the game, but it was down to luck if we\u2019d manage it. Sometimes we\u2019d get a whole week of identical clear days. It was the most expensive blue sky we\u2019d ever seen.\u201d</p> <h2>The car\u2019s the star</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f6f682c03be295c5687668d0a1931f645d42f63a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f6f682c03be295c5687668d0a1931f645d42f63a/0_742_4191_2514/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lamborghini Centenario\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The real Lamborghini Centenario on show at the Geneva International Motor Show on 1 March 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chesnot/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A similarly obsessive level of detail went into the car models. When the deal was struck to include the new Lamborghini Centenario in the game, it still hadn\u2019t been announced, so Playground had to send a staff member over to Italy to photograph the one production model available. He took thousands of images and measurements, but once again, there was significant time pressure.</p> <p>\u201cThey were still building this car as we were building our model,\u201d says Fulton. \u201cThey announced it at Geneva in April and we were building it to show at E3 in June \u2013 but it takes six months to build a car for Forza. That shoot was the last day that the car was actually complete - the next day Lamborghini tore it apart to make the moulds for the production parts.\u201d</p> <p>From there, it\u2019s a process of modelling a mesh of the car in the art package 3D Studio Max, turning all those images and measurements into a highly accurate representation. </p> <p>\u201cWe need to identify where different materials need to be placed in the car,\u201d says the principle vehicle artist, Simon Gibson. \u201cWe also have to construct models that will allow the doors to open. We used to try to match cinematic levels of detail. We\u2019re beyond that now.\u201d </p> <p>Indeed, the process of creating a 3D model of a car for a game is now almost as intensive as producing the actual model for production. The real Centenario production car uses more than 620 different types of materials, including carbon fibre, various alloy metal types, and plastic and composite materials on the exterior, as well as leather in the interiors and heat shield materials in the engine.</p> <p>Playground has sought to simulate all of these \u2013 \u201cto the sub-pixel level\u201d, insists Fulton. Most manufacturers will supply their blueprints and CAD data to development studios working on licensed racing games, so that their cars are as authentically reproduced as possible.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s definitely a convergence now between how cars are designed and how we make game models,\u201d says Gibson. \u201cWe actually borrow each other\u2019s software. But some cars don\u2019t have CAD information, so you have to use your skill as an artist to reproduce them.</p> <p>\u201cWith older cars especially, the panels were hand-beaten together so even if you make an accurate representation, that\u2019s only accurate to one car. You have to think about how each car was produced in reality in order to recreate it.\u201d</p> <p>Another challenge was tracking down some of the more specialist vehicles to garner modelling details from them. When the designers thought it would be fun to include a Reliant Regal in the line up, it took weeks to track one down. They eventually found a collector who\u2019d converted one into a tribute to the famous Only Fools and Horses van. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bee7a48be29abb23abcf5137919165480e62e40a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bee7a48be29abb23abcf5137919165480e62e40a/590_293_3101_1862/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A beautifully lit coastal scene in Forza Horizon 3\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A beautifully lit coastal scene in Forza Horizon 3.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Playground Games</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>What\u2019s fascinating about the video game production process is how these extravagant techniques are combined with ingenious short cuts and workarounds. The sea is an expensive element to include in a game, with wave simulation requiring a lot of complex physics. But then Playground discovered that another nearby Microsoft studio was working on similar technology. </p> <p>\u201cThe sea in Forza Horizon 3 is also the sea in Sea of Thieves,\u201d says Fulton. \u201cDoing proper sea tech is incredibly complex. We knew the guys up the road at Rare were working on the same problem. They\u2019re doing more deepsea stuff, but we got in touch with them, shared a bit of code, and we optimised it back and forth, so we\u2019ve both benefited.</p> <p>\u201cOur challenge was making the sea interact with the beach, so lapping waves, foam, wetting and drying the sand correctly \u2013 that was a whole other area of work. The 12 Apostles area is a sort of hero image for us, and we wanted the car to be down there racing. If you\u2019re going to be on a beach, the sea has to look good. That work paid off because driving the cars into the sea looks awesome.\u201d</p> <p>Some interesting workarounds were also employed in the sound design. When the audio team decided to move on from the collision samples they\u2019d sourced for Forza Horizon 2, they went to a scrapyard and recorded themselves smashing the hell out of an old Ford Ka with sledgehammers.</p> <p>\u201cOne of our team had a car he was going to scrap, so we said, wait a minute, we need this,\u201d says the audio designer Fraser Strachan. \u201cWe ended up spending a day throwing stones at it, to simulate the sound of gritty road surfaces. It didn\u2019t look good at the end.\u201d</p> <p>Elsewhere, when they wanted to get the isolated sound of tyres on a beach, they took a bunch of microphones up to St Andrews and recorded kite buggies. A more modest field trip than Australia, but still a symbol of the growing importance of accurate source materials in the age of photorealism.</p> <p>So does Playground think that the sky system in Horizon 3 will instigate a new era of month-long location shoots throughout the games industry? Wood doesn\u2019t think so.</p> <p>\u201cThe practicalities of it were crazy,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019ll probably lead the field on this going forward because the thought of copying it ... you\u2019d be mad to try. I could tell you all our secrets, but you still wouldn\u2019t want to do it.\u201d</p>",

Thank you.</p> <h2>The big picture</h2> <p>Last week provided a fair few signs that the path towards the kind of clean, hard Brexit Theresa May outlined to such a rapturous reception at the Conservative party conference will not be without pitfalls.</p> <p>The obstacles \u2013 political, economic, constitutional \u2013 came thick and fast. </p> <p>The one that garnered most media attention, of course, was Marmite-gate, a pricing row between Tesco and Unilever that saw <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/12/tesco-running-low-key-unilever-brands-price-row-supplier-supermarket-falling-pound\">the supermarket run short of supplies</a> of Britain\u2019s much-loved (and hated) spread and other famous household brands. </p> <p>That was resolved fairly rapidly. But <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/15/after-marmite-bitter-taste-price-rises-new-year-2017-retail\">analysts warned</a> it was merely a harbinger of the <a href=\"http://www.politico.eu/pro/nick-clegg-chocolate-cheese-prices-will-soar-after-hard-brexit/\">major price rises</a> likely to hit British consumers in the new year as manufacturers and retailers find themselves forced to respond to sterling\u2019s fall against both the euro and dollar, with the pound now <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/oct/12/sterling-rebounds-brexit-fears-bank-of-england-business-live?page=with:block-57fe1163e4b05d915e424186#block-57fe1163e4b05d915e424186\">plumbing record lows</a>. </p> <p>It is in the nature of currencies, of course, that their value fluctuates. More of a worry for the prime minister may be the stiffening parliamentary opposition to her view that MPs need not necessarily be consulted before article 50 is invoked. </p> <p>After several Tory MPs threatened to vote with Labour on the question, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/12/theresa-may-accepts-need-for-brexit-debate-in-parliament\">May was forced to accept the need for \u201cfull and transparent\u201d parliamentary scrutiny</a> of the UK\u2019s negotiating terms before Brexit is triggered (though she stopped short of allowing a vote). </p> <p>Perhaps heartened by the government climbdown, a <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/15/brexit-cross-party-mps-renew-calls-for-parliamentary-scrutiny\">powerful cross-party group of MPs is now demanding it publishes a substantive outline</a> of its plans for the UK\u2019s future relationship with the EU \u2013 a \u201cBrexit blueprint\u201d \u2013 and ensure parliament can amend it before negotiations start.</p> <p>That\u2019s not the end of it. Scotland is not too happy, either, with the direction Brexit appears to be taking in the wake of the Conservative conference.</p> <p>The first minister, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/16/nicola-sturgeon-second-scottish-referendum-likely-in-event-of-hard-brexit\">Nicola Sturgeon, said it was \u201chighly likely\u201d that Edinburgh would call a second independence referendum</a> by 2020 if Britain left the EU single market, adding that she also wanted to explore ways of keeping Scotland in the single market even if the rest of the UK left.</p> <p>Nor, it seems, are some of the most important sectors of the UK economy taking the threat of a hard Brexit lying down. </p> <p>After the French finance minister, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/14/us-banks-planning-exodus-from-brexit-britain-michel-sapin-french-minister\">Michel Sapin, said US banks were planning a post-Brexit exodus</a> from the City, the Open Europe thinktank said <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/17/banks-could-move-assets-out-of-uk-by-2017-if-eu-passport-is-lost\">some could begin moving assets out of the UK</a> as early as the end of 2017 if no deal is in prospect to maintain their rights to sell services freely across the EU. </p> <p>And the chief executive of Nissan, Carlos Ghosn, was sufficiently alarmed at the prospect of tariffs on car exports to seek <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/14/nissan-chief-executive-carlos-ghosn-meets-theresa-may-brexit-talks\">a personal meeting with May, during which she assured him the company would not be penalised</a> by Brexit (although there was no detail on how that might be achieved).</p> <p>The politics of the immediate financial aftermath of Brexit, too, look somewhat delicate, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/13/18bn-brexit-divorce-bill-eu-payment-boris-johnson\">Downing Street refusing to rule out the UK having to continue paying into the EU budget</a> after its exit and analysis suggesting a \u20ac20bn (\u00a318bn) \u201cBrexit divorce bill\u201d. That is hardly likely to please hardline Brexiters.<br></p> <p>(Separately, the government is reportedly <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/10/17/cabinet-considers-plan-to-keep-citys-single-market-access-by-pay/\">looking into the possibility of continuing to pay billions of pounds into the EU budget</a> after Brexit to maintain single-market access for the City and other vital sectors.)</p> <p>Doubtless, however, the prime minister will be heartened by the cheering words of her foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, who told the foreign affairs select committee that:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We are going to get the best possible [EU] deal for trade in goods and services ... We are going to get a deal which is of huge value, and possibly of greater value. I think those who prophesied doom before the referendum have been proved wrong, and I think they will continue to be proved wrong. </p> </blockquote> <h2>The view from Europe</h2> <p>Leaders from the EU\u2019s 28 (for the time being) member states gather at the end of the week for a European council summit in Brussels that will be May\u2019s first. Brexit won\u2019t be up for formal discussion \u2013 \u201cno negotiation before notification\u201d, as Brussels likes to say \u2013 but the PM will utter the B-word at dinner on Thursday evening. </p> <p>It\u2019s likely to be a fairly chilly affair. Donald Tusk, the council president who will chair the summit, became the latest EU leader to make clear the EU\u2019s view of the situation, saying last week that Britain faced the stark choice of either a hard Brexit or no Brexit \u2013 the first time he has taken such a clear line.</p> <p>Tusk said the leave campaign and its \u201ctake back control\u201d slogan showed the UK wanted to be free of EU law while rejecting free movement of people and contributions to the EU budget: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This approach has definitive consequences. Regardless of magic spells, this means a de facto will to radically loosen relations with the EU \u2013 something that goes by the name of hard Brexit ... The only real alternative to a hard Brexit is no Brexit, even if today hardly anyone believes in such a possibility.</p> </blockquote> <h2>Meanwhile, back in Westminster</h2> <p>In the ongoing tussle between government ministers over priorities for Brexit, the chancellor, Philip Hammond, is widely seen as the most economically cautious voice against ditching single market access in favour of immigration controls.</p> <p>Unnamed cabinet \u201csources\u201d have now started briefing against Hammond, accusing him of \u201carguing like an accountant\u201d (apparently a bad thing for the man in charge of the nation\u2019s finances). </p> <p>Monday\u2019s front pages saw similar stories in two conservative newspapers relaying the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/17/philip-hammonds-brexit-worries-point-to-cabinet-tensions\">anger of more staunchly pro-leave cabinet colleagues</a> at Hammond reportedly questioning the wisdom of a rapid post-Brexit crackdown on unskilled EU workers arriving in the UK.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/suttonnick/status/787767310631174144\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Monday&#39;s Times front page:<br>Hammond clashes with Brexiteers on migrants<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/tomorrowspaperstoday?src=hash\">#tomorrowspaperstoday</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/bbcpapers?src=hash\">#bbcpapers</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/WnPOVPBSvd\">pic.twitter.com/WnPOVPBSvd</a></p>&mdash;

  "<h2><strong>Suzanne Vega, singer-songwriter</strong></h2> <p>When I was at<strong> </strong>college in Manhattan in the early 1980s, I used to go to <a href=\"http://www.tomsrestaurant.net/\">Tom\u2019s Restaurant</a> on 112th and Broadway for coffee. I liked its ordinariness: it was the kind of place you\u2019d find on any corner. One day, I was in there mulling over a conversation I\u2019d had with a photographer friend, <a href=\"http://www.brianrose.com/\">Brian Rose</a>, about romantic alienation. He told me he saw his life as if through a pane of glass. I came out of Tom\u2019s with the idea of writing a song about an alienated character who just sees things happening around him. I was walking down Broadway and the melody popped into my head.</p> <p>The line about the actor \u201cwho had died while he was drinking\u201d was true: William Holden\u2019s obituary had been in that morning\u2019s paper. The \u201cbells of the cathedral\u201d were those of St John the Divine up the street, though I made up the bit about the woman \u201cfixing her stockings\u201d and changed \u201crestaurant\u201d to \u201cdiner\u201d to make it rhyme.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-26hsZqwveA\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/-26hsZqwveA?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>I imagined the song as some kind of French film background music, played on a piano, but I don\u2019t play piano so <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWyF3iSMzs\">I recorded it a capella</a> for my Solitude Standing album and didn\u2019t think much more about it. Three years later, I heard that two young English guys called DNA had put a beat to it \u2013 and I cringed. I\u2019d just had a big hit with <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZt7J0iaUD0\">Luka</a>, which \u2013 unfortunately, despite its dark subject matter, child abuse \u2013 lent itself to all sorts of parodies and covers, most of which I hated. </p> <p>I feared more of the same, but to my great relief I loved what DNA had done. I thought it would be played in a few dance clubs and that would be it, but it surpassed everyone\u2019s expectations. I even got a plaque for it being one of the most played R&amp;B songs \u2013 funny for a folk singer. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a41ab4b393c8375f0c2d6be9b097f7b8ec20655d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a41ab4b393c8375f0c2d6be9b097f7b8ec20655d/20_319_3504_2103/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018De der der der, de der der der\u2019 \u2026 Tom\u2019s Restaurant, Vega\u2019s inspiration.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018De der der der, de der der der\u2019 \u2026 Tom\u2019s Restaurant, Vega\u2019s inspiration.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Neville Elder/Corbis/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Tom\u2019s Restaurant has since featured in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/seinfeld\">Seinfield</a>, and has more clippings on the wall relating to that than me or my song.

He brought in Suzanne\u2019s song and said: \u201cI reckon we can stick a beat under this.\u201d I came up with a bassline, strings, a bit of piano. In those days, it was impossible to get a whole song into a sampler, so we spent evenings and weekends cutting Suzanne\u2019s vocals into little bits. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We were kept off the No 1 slot by the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>We sent it to a mate who was a rep in London and he took it around the shops.

Then the track became massive. We were only kept off No 1 by the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.</p> <p>Shortly afterwards, we went to see Suzanne play in London and she opened with Tom\u2019s Diner.

  "<p>Household energy bills in four years\u2019 time will be \u00a317 higher annually than planned because of the number of windfarms and solar panels installed in recent years, according to the government\u2019s spending watchdog.</p> <p>The amount of money levied on bills each year to pay for renewable energy subsidies is capped under a system called the levy control framework, to limit costs for consumers and businesses. The cap was set at \u00a37.1bn for 2020/21, but government officials warned last year it was on track to hit \u00a39.1bn because so much green energy was being deployed. </p> <p>The National Audit Office revised this down on Tuesday to \u00a38.7bn, or \u00a3110 of what is forecast be a \u00a3991 average annual household bill by 2020, up \u00a317 on what it would have been if the cap was met.</p> <p>But energy department officials were quick to point out that the new forecast is within the 20% of \u2018headroom\u2019 that is allowed over the cap.<br></p> <p>The NAO said the framework had failed to provide value for money because the expected overshoot meant there was now little money to support further new renewables up to 2020. Spending more later would have been more cost-effective because the price of building green energy is coming down, the watchdog said.<br></p> <p>Sir Amyas Morse, auditor general of the NAO, said: \u201cThe levy control framework has helped make some of the impacts of renewable energy policies on consumers clearer. But government\u2019s forecasting, allocation of the budget and approach to dealing with uncertainty has been poor, and so has not supported value for money.\u201d</p> <p>In a report published on Tuesday, the NAO blamed the expected overspend on the energy department being slow to see that more renewable energy was being deployed than expected because of the subsidies. Offshore windfarms have generated more electricity than expected, too. Officials were also accused of failing to gather market intelligence frequently enough.</p> <p>But lower than expected fossil fuel prices had also played a small role, because the most recent subsidy schemes for windfarms \u2013 contracts for difference \u2013 pay their operators a top-up payment above the price of wholesale electricity, which has been lower than was forecast.</p> <p>\u201cThe department took too long to discover that it was on course to exceed the framework cap,\u201d said the report. \u201cOne reason for increased forecast costs was the global slump in fossil fuel prices, a development which energy market experts in general were not expecting.\u201d</p> <p>The NAO said the Department of Energy and Climate Change, now part of an enlarged business department, had got better at managing the framework since 2015. The future of the framework and support for green energy beyond 2020-21 is not yet clear, but energy experts have said they hope for clarity in the autumn statement.</p> <p>The report also said that the cost of paying gas and coal power station operators to provide standby power during the winter - under the \u2018capacity market\u2019 - would account for an increasing cost on bills. The scheme, plus a levy to make the draughtiest homes more efficient and the cost of fitting smart meters is expected to make up \u00a354 of an average household bill in 2020, though these are not covered by the levy control framework.</p> <p>A spokesman for the Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said: \u201cOur top priority is ensuring that families and businesses have a secure, affordable, clean energy supply. Our actions have reduced projected costs on the levy control framework by around \u00a3520m, and we continue to make further improvements to deliver value for money for consumers.\u201d<br></p>",

It\u2019s contemptuous not just of the process, it\u2019s contemptuous of this beautiful suburb and our architectural heritage. This is a spit in the eye of Carlton from a couple of contemptuous cowboys.\u201d</p> <p>Doyle said the developer claimed to have received an engineer\u2019s report on Friday night declaring a fire the previous Friday had made it unsafe. However he said council experts, including the municipal building surveyor, inspected the building following the fire and reported the damage was not structurally significant.</p> <p>\u201cThis is the most brazen and wanton act of destructive vandalism that I\u2019ve seen in my time as lord mayor and both the minister and I are outraged,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The pub, previously known as the Carlton Inn, was a popular watering hole with law students at Melbourne University, who have joined heritage groups in campaigning for the full reconstruction of the building. </p> <p>Student spokesman Tim Staindl declared the pub \u201can important part of the university experience.\u201d</p> <p>A <a href=\"https://www.change.org/p/city-of-melbourne-resurrect-the-corkman-pub\">petition</a> condemning the demolition amassed more than 4,000 signatures in 18 hours.</p> <p>The 1857 building was not heritage-listed but was in a heritage overlay and had been <a href=\"http://dsewebapps.dse.vic.gov.au/Shared/ats.nsf/(attachmentopen)/F204446EA858F8C5CA257BF20008DA28/$File/Melbourne+C198+Incorporated+document+-+City+North+Heritage+Review+Statements+of+Significance+2012.pdf\">assessed as being</a> of \u201caesthetic significance as a good example of the Victorian period\u201d.

time, Leyonhjelm released correspondence between himself and the Abbott government from 2015 where the government clearly agreed to a 12 month sunset clause on the Adler ban in return for his vote on migration legislation.</p> <p>The correspondence indicates that Abbott had himself horse traded on gun laws with Leyonhjelm in return for his support for other, non-related government legislation

questions about whether the government had ever offered to weaken Australia\u2019s gun laws in return for support in the Senate.</p> <p>The justice minister, Michael Keenan, suggested to parliament that agreeing to the sunset clause wasn\u2019t indicative of the government\u2019s long term disposition on the Adler.</p> <p>He said the government had \u201calways been 100% clear in our position that we will restrict their import until we get an agreement with the states about where they were to be classified\u201d.</p> <p>Turnbull insisted there was no prospect of weakening the Howard

But what he has not proposed, at least not in my hearing, is any weakening of the national firearms agreement as it stands,\u201d the prime minister said.</p> <p>\u201cHe has a view as to the manner in which it should be strengthened. He is entitled to have that view as indeed are other shooter organisations and their representatives.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe government, of course, listens to those views as I\u2019m sure justice ministers and premiers in other jurisdictions do as well.\u201d</p>",

And they know he\u2019s married.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cEvery assault should be taken care of in court of law,\u201d Trump said, but the accusations made in the media are \u201cdamaging and it\u2019s unfair.\u201d<br></p> <p>\u201cI believe my husband. This was all organized from the opposition,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThey don\u2019t have any facts and even the story that came out in People Magazine, the writer that she said that my husband took her to the room and start kissing her, she wrote in the same story about me that she saw me on Fifth Avenue and I said to her, Natasha, how come we don\u2019t see you anymore? I was never friend with her. I\u2019d never recognize her.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow we could believe her? That never happened.\u201d</p> <p>Despite the pressures of the campaign on her marriage, Trump said, she does not want people feeling bad for her.</p> <p>\u201cPeople think and talk about me like, \u2018oh Melania, oh poor Melania.\u2019 Don\u2019t feel sorry for me, don\u2019t feel sorry for me.

His non-answer provoked much ire, especially since many other athletes were quick to criticise Trump\u2019s remarks.</p> <p>Brady, who threw for 376 yards and three touchdowns in New England\u2019s 35-17 win over the Bengals on Sunday, told Boston sports radio WEEI that he ducked the question because didn\u2019t want to create extra headlines.</p> <p>He said: \u201cIt\u2019s just the way it is right now. Obviously there\u2019s a lot of headlines to make, and I\u2019ve tried not to make a lot of headlines. I\u2019ve been in an organization where we\u2019re taught to say very little, we have respect for our opponents and we don\u2019t do the trash-talking.</p> <p>\u201cThe thing I\u2019ve always thought is I don\u2019t want to be a distraction for the team. That\u2019s what my goal is. Not that there are things I\u2019ve said and done that haven\u2019t been, but you try not to be. It\u2019s just hard enough to win and prepare without the distractions so when you start having the distractions it\u2019s even harder to prepare.\u201d</p> <p>However, Brady\u2019s refusal to answer the question arguably created just as much of distraction for the Patriots, a point which was acknowledged by former New England receiver Troy Brown on Sunday.</p> <p>Brown said: \u201c[He should have said] just something, a quick answer on the question to get it out of the way, just answer the question to say, \u2018I don\u2019t condone it\u2019 and then walk off the stage. The optics of it weren\u2019t great. I understood what he was trying to do. But the next time he\u2019s asked that question, then give a quick answer and let it be. I\u2019m not responsible for what comes out of my friend\u2019s mouth. But I am responsible for correcting my friend.\u201d</p> <p>Today, Brady again said that he and Trump have been friends for 15 years, and that \u201cI\u2019ve always had a good time with him\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/17/tom-brady-donald-trump-press-conference-distraction\">Tom Brady says he ducked Trump questions to avoid team distractions</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58054a18e4b0cd26ff71e1d4\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-17T22:01:59.374Z\">11.01pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <h2>Juanita Broaddrick, on Donald Trump\u2019s accusers:</h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>If these accounts are true, yeah.

This is one of the big-breaking stories of our time, in my opinion - this shows corruption at the highest level, and we can\u2019t let it happen as American citizens.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo let\u2019s see how the press covers it,\u201d he continued. \u201cThe press likes not to cover it because the best thing that Hillary Clinton has going is the media. Without the media, she wouldn\u2019t even be in this race. This is collusion between the FBI, the Department of Justice and the State Department to make Hillary Clinton look like an innocent person when she\u2019s guilty of very high crimes.
