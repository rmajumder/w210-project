  "<p>Britain\u2019s sharp rise up the league table for global competitiveness to its highest place in a decade risks being reversed by the vote for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\">Brexit</a>, according to the World Economic Forum.</p> <p>The body that runs the annual Davos event said Britain had risen three places in the past year to rank seventh, but said the analysis for its <a href=\"http://www3.weforum.org/docs/Media/GCR1617/GCR_16.pdf\">Global Competitiveness report</a> had used data collected before the 23 June referendum.<br></p> <p>Noting that the UK was currently one of the most competitive economies in the world, the WEF said: \u201cAlthough the process and the conditions of Brexit are still unknown, it is likely to have a negative impact on the United Kingdom\u2019s competitiveness through goods and financial markets as well as market size and, potentially, innovation\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/26/brexit-anxiety-financial-services-sector-cbi-\">Brexit anxiety taking its toll on financial services sector, CBI finds</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The WEF study chimes with reports from other global institutions - including the International Monetary Fund and the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development - which said ahead of the referendum that Brexit would have a long-term impact on the UK in terms of weaker inward investment and less trade.</p> <p>The studies have been challenged by Brexit supporters, who say the UK will be able to forge closer trade links with countries outside the EU and will benefit from a reduction in the red tape generated in Brussels.</p> <p>The WEF\u2019s report is published at a time when the government is mulling over its exit strategy from the EU. Some ministers favour a soft Brexit under which the UK would prioritise access to the single market, while others back a hard Brexit that would make immigration control the priority in negotiations.</p> <p>The chancellor, Philip Hammond, said: \u201cToday\u2019s report demonstrates our ability to sharpen our edge and improve our competitiveness. This government will build on that progress, as we demonstrate to the world that Britain continues to be highly competitive and open for business.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/22/uk-economy-faces-challenging-period-after-brexit-vote-says-bank\">UK economy faces challenging period after Brexit vote, says Bank</a> </p> </aside>  <p> <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/launch-of-the-world-trade-report-2016-inclusive-trade-and-smes\">Speaking at the World Trade Organisation in Geneva on Tuesday, the international trade secretary, Liam Fox, </a>said the UK would push for more trade liberalisation after Brexit.<br></p> <p>\u201cThe decision of the British people to leave the EU is not symptomatic of looking inwards, but a people who want to take more control over our laws, our money and our borders,\u201d Fox said. \u201cWe are a proud and outward-looking trading nation.\u201d</p> <p>The WEF said the UK\u2019s competitiveness relied on highly efficient goods and labour markets, in which it ranked 9th and 5th respectively out of the 138 countries assessed. The UK was third for technological readiness and scored more highly than the EU as a whole in11 of the 12 categories covered.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Britain scored less well than the EU for its macro-economic environment, largely because of its large budget deficit, high debt ratio and weak performance in savings. Despite a rise of 23 places in the category, the UK still ranks only 85th in the world. </p> <p>The three top countries in the league table \u2013 Switzerland, Singapore and the US \u2013 remain unchanged from 2015, with the rest of the top 10 made up of the Netherlands, Germany, Sweden, the UK, Japan, Hong Kong and Finland.</p> <p>European countries made up half of the top 10, but the WEF said there was a marked divide between the north and south of the continent. Spain was up one place to 32nd, Italy dropped a spot to 44th and Greece dropped five places to 86th. France, the second biggest country in eurozone rose one position to 21st.</p> <p>\u201cFor all economies in Europe, maintaining and improving prosperity levels will depend heavily on their ability to harness innovation and the talents of their workforces\u201d, the WEF said. </p> <p>The report also noted an increase in both the developed and developing world in non-tariff barriers to trade, more burdensome customs procedures and tighter rules affecting both foreign direct investment and foreign ownership. The trend was most evident in high and upper middle-income countries.</p> <p>Klaus Schwab, the WEF\u2019s founder and executive chairman, said: \u201cDeclining openness in the global economy is harming competitiveness and making it harder for leaders to drive sustainable, inclusive growth.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>Ratings for the first presidential debate between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are starting to trickle in, and while 83 million Americans watched, viewership was not quite as \u201cyuge\u201d as anticipated.

The latest figure is all the more impressive given the number of digital streaming options available to viewers \u2013 CBS\u2019s digital news division, CBSN, said it had logged 2.98m streams and 1.4 million unique viewers in total. YouTube said just under 2 million people streamed video of the debate from six news outlets that officially used its platform.

Jenkins, who continues to run the club on a day-to-day basis, has already considered a move for Ryan Giggs and it increasingly seems like a matter of when, not if, Guidolin is dismissed.</p> <p>Swansea\u2019s owners did not want to be seen as making a knee-jerk decision so soon after taking over at the club and were prepared to give Guidolin a bit more time. There were some positive signs <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/24/swansea-city-manchester-city-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">during the 3-1 defeat at home against Manchester City on Saturday</a>, when Swansea produced some of their best football for a long time, yet the harsh reality is that it was a fourth defeat in five matches.</p> <p>A similar result against Liverpool may well see Guidolin relieved of his duties, less than five months after he was given a two-year contract, and enable Swansea to make an appointment during the international break.</p> <p>The club are anxious to avoid a repeat of the situation in which they found themselves when Garry Monk was sacked in December last year. On that occasion there was a protracted search for a new manager and Alan Curtis, who remains at the club, was later given the job on a temporary basis before Guidolin was brought in.</p> <p>In terms of the current short-list, Bradley, who is in charge of Le&#xa0;Havre in France, is firmly in the running along with Giggs, but Swansea are believed to have other names under consideration as well.</p>",

  "<p>There is a quirky design feature at CSKA Moscow\u2019s new stadium. In one of the corners, there is a skyscraper in the shape of the Uefa Cup, the trophy CSKA won in 2005 when they became the first Russian club to claim a major European honour. The tower cast a metaphorical shadow.

This was a test of his team\u2019s credentials. How they passed it, with a performance of nerve and style that not only not got them up and running in Group E but reinforced the feelgood factor that has been building.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/26/harry-kane-injury-tottenham-arsenal\">Tottenham\u2019s Kane on the mend and may be fit for trip to Arsenal in November</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Tottenham were the better team and they became stronger as the game wore on but they needed to make their supremacy count. Thanks to Erik Lamela and Son Heung-min, they did so. It was Lamela\u2019s pass that released the South Korea forward and he finished past Igor Akinfeev for his fifth goal in five appearances.</p> <p>Pochettino punched the air, and relief was prominent among his emotions. He might have signed for the draw beforehand but once Tottenham had settled it was clear the three points were within their grasp. What made the winning goal even more satisfying for Pochettino was that it followed his first substitution and a redeploying of his resources.</p> <p>Vincent Janssen had a frustrating time, working tirelessly but failing to get anything to fall his way and the striker made way on 67 minutes. Lamela moved up front \u2013 he would later swap positions with Son on the flank \u2013 and Georges-K\u00e9vin Nkoudou entered on the other side.</p> <p>Pochettino\u2019s movements in the summer transfer window were aimed at putting a few game-changers on the bench but it was Lamela and Son who combined decisively. Lamela\u2019s pass got Son one-on-one against Igor Akinfeev and, with the destiny of the tie at his feet, the finish was too strong for the keeper. Akinfeev got something to it but it was not enough and the ball made it way over the line.</p> <p>\u201cWe tried to find more mobility in offensive positions; that\u2019s why we took off Vincent and sent on Nkoudou,\u201d Pochettino said. \u201cFrom the first ball [after the change], we found the link. I\u2019m pleased for Sonny, he\u2019s on fire. The victory was fully deserved. Our performance was about attitude and passion.\u201d</p> <p>Pochettino reacted to the injuries that deprived him of Eric Dier, Mousa Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 and Moussa Sissoko in midfield by switching to a 4-3-3 formation, with Christian Eriksen and Dele Alli pushed forward either side of Victor Wanyama. Alli, in particular, grew as a creative influence.</p> <p>It was the stadium\u2019s first Champions League tie and the opening whistle was the prompt for the locals to launch into their songs. The drums sounded and the red and blue flags fluttered. By the end, the diehards behind one of the goals had even gone bare-chested. It was not intimidating, as some of the old-school Russian venues can be, but it was lively. The only moment of silence followed Son\u2019s goal.</p> <p>CSKA carried a physical threat in the shape of the one-time Everton centre-forward, Lacina Traor\u00e9, and there was a moment in the first half, after Alli had lost the ball to the slippery Roman Eremenko, when Traor\u00e9 was one-on-one with Toby Alderweireld inside the area. Alderweireld stood tall to ease in front of him. It was a snapshot of the robust physical duel between the pair \u2013 one that Alderweireld would win by a unanimous decision.</p> <p>Tottenham\u2019s best moment of an even and slow-burning first half had come after an incision from Eriksen. Pontus Wernbloom scrambled the ball away but only as far as Alli, who fired a rising drive from 25 yards that clattered against the crossbar. There was also a chance for Alderweireld after a corner had been recycled and Kieran Trippier, who was preferred to Kyle Walker at right-back, crossed. Alderweireld\u2019s free header lacked bite.</p> <p>CSKA flickered before the interval. Zoran Tosic shot high from the edge of the area while a piece of flamboyance from Eremenko got him away from Lamela but Hugo Lloris saved his low shot.</p> <p>Pochettino\u2019s team took control after the interval. Trippier and Ben Davies pressed higher up the flanks while Alli began to enjoy some space. His twinkle-toes threatened to make something happen. Son had his bursts, too.</p> <p>Pochettino had watched Son curl a shot narrowly wide and Lamela go close with a deflected effort, and he simply wanted one killer pass for one clear-cut chance. Lamela provided it. Son can do little wrong at present and there was a certain inevitability about how he would beat Akinfeev. The sudden silence inside the arena was jolting. Eremenko would work Lloris in the 80th minute but CSKA were broken.</p>",

The bottom of a river, perhaps.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2016/sep/28/sam-allardyce-leaves-england-job-latest-news-and-reaction-live\">Sam Allardyce leaves England job: latest news and\u00a0reaction \u2013 live!</a> </p> </aside>  <p>He is a clot, that\u2019s for sure. If you have followed Allardyce\u2019s career, the infamous Panorama documentary and the chequered past of his agent, Mark Curtis, it is not any surprise the man the FA appointed in July was ripe for a newspaper sting. It is unusual, perhaps, that it is the Daily Telegraph having a go at playing the Fake Sheikh and there are parts of its coverage that, to be blunt, are questionable, to say the least. Yet there is no doubt about it: Allardyce has caused his employer an extreme form of embarrassment. He had his chance, he blew it and one of the most arrogant men in the business will have a long time to mull over what he should have done differently.</p> <p>Whether that means he deserved to lose his job is another matter entirely and, even as a non-Allardyce fan, having questioned his relationship with Curtis more than once, it is still not entirely straightforward understanding what the FA has seen in those secretly taped recordings to warrant the guillotine.</p> <p>Presumably, the relevant people have decided it is untenable for an organisation that stands in judgment on others to employ someone who just informed two undercover reporters, posing as representatives from a football agency based in south-east Asia, that it is \u201cnot a problem\u201d to get round the rules of third-party ownership, despite the practice being banned in 2008. Yet that quote is referring to the fact that when Allardyce was managing West Ham they signed Enner Valencia despite him being precisely in that position. The ownership agreement ended when the transfer went through and West Ham signed him \u201cwhole\u201d. Something similar happened with Manchester United and Marcus Rojo. It is not a problem, as Allardyce says, getting round it.</p> <p>He should not expect a great deal of sympathy but in the grand scheme of managerial scandals it is certainly a few notches down from the passage in Joey Barton\u2019s newly released autobiography about the \u201ccreative accounting\u201d of one manager (though not one, he says, he ever played under) whose \u201cspeciality was making late substitutions on the understanding his assistant would later collect a percentage of the player\u2019s match fee\u201d. That manager, according to Barton, was infamous for giving homegrown players their debuts, sometimes just for a few minutes, so the academy director would collect a bonus, to be split again. The manager would re-sign players he had worked with at other clubs and take a cut from them, too \u2013 paid monthly, and invariably in cash.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/27/sam-allardyce-england-managers-controversies-terry-venables-fabio-capello\">England managers and off-field controversies: from Revie to Hodgson</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Compare that with Allardyce\u2019s response when asked about paying people to secure business. \u201cOh, oh, you\u2019re not \u2013 do not,\u201d he says. \u201cI haven\u2019t heard that. I haven\u2019t heard that, you stupid man. What are you talking about? You idiot. You can have that conversation when I\u2019m not here.\u201d</p> <p>Allardyce is so aghast by the suggestion he leans back and drapes a napkin over his face. Later he gives the man who brought it up, his long-term friend and football agent Scott McGarvey, another going-over. \u201cYou slipped up tonight. You can\u2019t go there any more. You can\u2019t pay a player, you can\u2019t pay a manager, you can\u2019t pay a CEO. It used to happen 20 odd years ago, 30 years ago. You can\u2019t do it now. You can\u2019t do it now. Don\u2019t ever go there.\u201d None of which really falls in line with the caricature of the man who regards rules as optional.</p> <p>If this sounds like a defence of Allardyce it is merely to give that part of the story some extra prominence given the Telegraph buried the quotes somewhere near the bottom of the 2,000-word article that has brought him down. There is no Friends-of-Sam public-relations operation swinging into gear, not here anyway.

He was given the job almost by default \u2013 the best bad idea the FA could come up with \u2013 and it is no surprise whatsoever he has landed himself in trouble, only that it has happened so quickly. Maybe, when the dust settles, the three FA executives who appointed him \u2013 Martin Glenn, Dan Ashworth and the vastly overrated David Gill \u2013 can explain what they did by way of due diligence. Glenn did, in fairness, warn us he was \u201cnot a football expert\u201d. His first appointment as the chief executive has been a PR disaster.</p> <p>As for Allardyce, he probably understands now what Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson meant after the Swede taught himself about the role by reading The Second Most Important Job in the Country, Niall Edworthy\u2019s account of the various England managers and how they survived the pressures. \u201cThey were more or less killed, all of them,\u201d Eriksson said. \u201cWhy should I be different?\u201d</p> <p>At the same time, Allardyce is probably entitled to a few grievances of his own. He has been accused of a potential conflict of interests by affiliating himself with a company whose clients could purportedly be England players when, in reality, it is a much more mundane truth. He made it absolutely clear that before he committed to anything he would have to run everything by the FA.</p> <p>What, you might wonder, was the greedy old fool, already on a \u00a33m\u2011a\u2011year contract, doing hawking himself around a couple of weeks after getting the England job? But that is the nature of the business, whether you like it or not. Managers exploit their position for speaking engagements, public appearances and other commercial activities, and Allardyce is not the only one who would be tempted by \u00a3400,000 (eventually bumped up to \u00a3600,000) for four \u201cmeet-and-greets and nothing else\u201d in Singapore and Hong Kong. \u201cEngland manager for sale\u201d was the headline that jumped off Tuesday\u2019s newsstands. Allardyce, the opening sentence informed us, had been using his position to negotiate the deal. Well, of course he was.</p> <p>The rest of it is the kind of standard pub talk most football people would come out with on a night out. Lots of people have questioned whether Gary Neville, Roy Hodgson\u2019s assistant, was \u201cthe wrong influence\u201d during Euro 2016. Even more have expressed wonder about the vast riches spent on rebuilding Wembley.</p> <p>Allardyce\u2019s relationship with Hodgson is bound to suffer given what he said about his predecessor being, in short, the kind of public speaker who sends his audience to sleep. The two were never close anyway and, yes, it is awkward in the extreme to hear Allardyce mimic \u201cWoy\u201d when the FA once locked horns with the Sun, calling it \u201cunacceptable\u201d for doing the same.</p> <p>Equally, this is a manager talking in what he thinks is an off-the-record environment, possibly half-cut, with an undercover journalist chucking in a question he knows may elicit an unguarded answer. \u201cWhere did Roy go wrong then, as a manager?\u201d and hey presto. It is the kind of journalism the Telegraph would once have considered beneath it and, even with a man\u2019s P45 on the way, it is difficult to find the killer line, no matter how many times you read it.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/27/sam-allardyce-leaves-england-manager-role-fa\">Sam Allardyce leaves England manager job after one game in charge</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The weirdest part \u2013 not that it particularly matters now \u2013 is that Allardyce did not appear to know Marcus Rashford\u2019s name, referring to him as \u201cRushford\u201d before someone in his party corrected him. No one can be sure, however, how much booze had been demolished and it is faintly ludicrous to suggest his relationship with the players may have suffered because he was on tape saying they had a \u201cpsychological barrier\u201d and could not cope with the pressures of an international tournament.</p> <p>Allardyce has said exactly the same in his interviews \u2013 more in the way of fact, rather than criticism \u2013 and the players will, for the most part, admit it anyway. Many of them were unenthused about Allardyce getting the job in the first place but, two months in, the last thing they would have wanted is the disruption of another managerial change.</p> <p>And Southgate? He turned down the caretaker role after Euro 2016 because, in part, he knew the players wanted someone with a higher standing. The whole thing is a mess and, at the heart of it, the damage to Allardyce\u2019s professional reputation is irretrievable.</p>",

  "<p>It\u2019s a scene that has played out hundreds of times before, heard by millions but seen by only a small roomful of people. Bruce McAvaney, adopting the unshakable postural arc of a veteran racing caller, stands from his chair and stoops forward slightly in the Seven broadcasting booth, binoculars firmly pressed to his eyes as he motors through another rapid-fire description of the action unfolding beyond the glass. His voice deepens to the kind of ecstatic growl every football fan knows well. The growl is the same whether McAvaney\u2019s calling the opening bounce of a cut-throat final or junk time in a pre-season blowout. </p> <p>Calmly seated beside him is Dennis Cometti; immaculately blazered, liberally hairsprayed and laconic. From his chair Cometti alternates between a panoramic view of the ground, his carefully-prepared notes and a small TV monitor on the desk in front of him. He absorbs McAvaney\u2019s description through his right ear, mentally limbering up for his own entrance. The opening is something Cometti can sense from decades spent as McAvaney\u2019s co-pilot on hundreds of football broadcasts but also by his colleague\u2019s cadence \u2013 sometimes wearied and flagging but with McAvaney, just as often a spittle-inducing parabola whose upward peak pushes the limits of human oxygen intake. When Bruce\u2019s bolt is shot, his left arm comes down and he tags his offsider into the fray with a collegial hand on the shoulder. Dennis Cometti is away.</p> <p>So endures Australian sports broadcasting\u2019s premier double act, or so it has, until this weekend, when at the conclusion of the AFL grand final Cometti peels off his headset, rolls back his chair and rises next to his favourite colleague one last time. After 49 years in broadcasting \u2013 30 of them calling AFL football on network television \u2013 Dennis Cometti himself is tapping out.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9b516eac2c2febe73dd128ed579e5c0a51e34749\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9b516eac2c2febe73dd128ed579e5c0a51e34749/0_65_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dennis Cometti interviewing Hawthorn coach Alastair Clarkson\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dennis Cometti interviews Hawthorn coach Alastair Clarkson before an AFL game in 2014.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Morne de Klerk/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>\u2018You can go back to the place but not the time\u2019</strong></h2> <p>To fully understand Dennis Cometti you need to start with family. To do that you have to begin with the lowlight of Cometti\u2019s life: the sudden death in 1969 of his father James, the son of working class Italian migrant Giovanni, who travelled to Australia in 1909 from Tirano in the Northern Italian Alps and walked 800km through blistering sun from Perth to find backbreaking work and a new life in the harsh, dust-swept terrain of the Meekatharra goldfields.</p> <p>When James Cometti collapsed on a Perth street and died of a heart attack his 18-year-old son and only child was busy training with WAFL team West Perth. Dennis was by that point a teen sensation. The winter before he\u2019d kicked 60 goals and played alongside the club\u2019s legendary captain-coach Graham \u201cPolly\u201d Farmer in a league semi-final. </p> <p>Expectations for Cometti\u2019s fledgling football career were lofty, and the father-son bond shared by James and Dennis had been strengthened by the game. It was James Cometti who passed on so many of the fundamentals that would later appear in his son\u2019s oft-quoted commentary. Their conversations, and all the long afternoons spent sitting side-by-side at the footy had become a roadmap for Dennis Cometti\u2019s understanding of the game.</p> <p>The day before James Cometti died, he and his son had what seemed at the time a trivial argument. Dennis returned home late from a night on the town \u2013 not the commitment to his burgeoning sports career his father expected of him. Their disagreement was not a screaming match and there were no histrionics, just disappointed silence. What they didn\u2019t know was that they\u2019d never speak again. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/27/it-still-feels-close-vin-catoggio-on-grand-final-heartbreak-and-finding-peace\">'It still feels close': Vin Catoggio on grand final heartbreak and finding peace | Russell Jackson</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cIt lingered on until the next day and I didn\u2019t see him in the morning and he passed away that afternoon,\u201d Cometti tells me as we look back on his life. \u201cI always felt that was a terrible thing to have happened because the relationship was so close. I was an only child and he was more a mate than he was my Dad, and just a really good bloke. I felt that I\u2019d let the team down a little bit by doing that.\u201d</p> <p>The manner in which Cometti learned of his father\u2019s death has always stuck with him, too. Razzed onto the training track by West Perth players, a young police constable accommodated his nerves by laughing at the gibes as he approached the lanky young spearhead. It was a misleading portent. Guided to the sidelines, Cometti was bluntly presented with the news: \u201cBy the way, your dad is dead.\u201d Shocked, he left the ground and had to identify the body to spare his mother Dulcie the task. </p> <p>After his father\u2019s death Cometti drifted from footy, withdrawing into himself and pushing the game away. Meanwhile, the gravitational pull of his alternative life as a rookie FM radio disc jockey was proving strong, so he only half-heartedly committed himself to West Perth and wouldn\u2019t return to the fold properly until well over a decade later, in a middling three-year stint as coach.</p> <p>\u201cWith my Dad not there, because we\u2019d really had an adventure together with footy from when I was about 11 and we\u2019d had a lot of fun with it, I think I was able to drift a lot more readily,\u201d Cometti says. \u201cHad he been there I\u2019m sure he would have pulled me into line. I respected him greatly and I would have felt that I was letting him down. When he\u2019d gone I let my standards slip because he wasn\u2019t there to safeguard my standards.\u201d</p> <p>What kind of man did Dennis Cometti become as a result of the events of March 1969? Perhaps it\u2019s best to consider a pair of facts from the life he made following his father\u2019s death. The first is that at some point, adapting the lyrics to an obscure song called Waking Up Alone by 1970s singer-songwriter Paul Williams, Cometti settled upon a revealing credo for his life: \u201cyou can go back to the place but not the time.\u201d</p> <p>The second is that despite the fame and millions of dollars that his career in broadcasting has brought him, Dennis Cometti still lives in the house he grew up in \u2013 Jack and Dulcie Cometti\u2019s family home in Perth.</p> <h2><strong>\u2018You know he\u2019s in the room\u2019</strong></h2> <p> When you speak to people who\u2019ve spent a lot of time around Dennis Cometti you encounter a few recurring observations; nobody who has ever worked alongside him has a bad word to say about the guy; his preparation for every broadcast is exhaustive \u2013 whether it\u2019s a NAB Challenge pre-season junket in Dubai or a finals blockbuster \u2013 and that the retiring broadcaster is an irreplaceable talent.</p> <p>Colleagues also talk about his <em>presence, </em>a statesmanlike aura that makes even champion footballers self-conscious in his company. \u201cYou know he\u2019s in the room,\u201d his Triple M and former Channel Seven colleague Michael Roberts says. \u201cAnd when he speaks, people listen.\u201d</p> <p>Cometti is tall, gangly and easy to imagine as his youthful self \u2013 flying high into the backs of defenders for pack marks. His long, crooked nose bends across his face like a crow swooping down from a streetlamp, a Cometti family trait he\u2019s traced back to the old country. His ears are long and droopy, lending him the air of a friendly basset hound. That face, unmistakable to old-timers when he\u2019s out and about, is a type you don\u2019t really see on TV anymore. Cometti is the Toby jug commemorative version of a 1970s newsreader.</p> <p>Most who know him mention Cometti\u2019s unique and occasionally flamboyant dress sense, which would probably sit somewhere between a comfortably unhip veteran rock star and Alan Partridge; carefully pressed denim, sunglasses and leather jackets. Older colleagues remember the youthful era in which the jeans were subbed out for outrageous leather pants. \u201cThey were fashionable leather pants, if leather pants can be fashionable,\u201d laughs Cometti\u2019s former Seven commentary colleague Drew Morphett. \u201cHe was a product of the rock \u2018n\u2019 roll era. You wouldn\u2019t see Jonathan Brown or Jason Dunstall or anybody else going out in leather pants. It became a bit of a signature for him.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgAOrWVHsz0\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/DgAOrWVHsz0?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Dennis Cometti quits as West Perth football coach.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>When Cometti lobbed at Triple J for an appearance in the late 90s, the station\u2019s staff were delighted to note that the commentary legend not only travelled with a leather man-bag tucked under his arm but that it contained a miniature can of hairspray. Cometti\u2019s never been shy about the haircare routine. Before he goes on air he will confer with make-up artists as to the specific brand they\u2019re using, often carefully applying the finishing touches himself. The Cometti barnet is now almost as iconic as the voice \u2013 a perfectly sculpted helmet of hair. \u201cHe\u2019s rock n roll,\u201d says Roberts. \u201cYou know him in a crowd.\u201d</p> <p>As his retirement heralds the end of an era, Cometti is also one of the few remaining denizens of Australian showbiz whose employers consider worthy of limousine service. He\u2019s only ever been late to a game once, after a cancelled flight to a Sunday fixture in Adelaide, for which he didn\u2019t arrive until quarter time. His Melbourne driver, Raj, has ferried Cometti and his wife Velia around town for years. When a network boss joked that Seven were paying Raj more than some of Cometti\u2019s co-commentators, the broadcasting icon shot back: \u201cWell you should be paying your commentators more.\u201d</p> <p>Co-workers consider a ride in the Cometti limo a bit of thrill, though none can claim an anecdote as colourful as that provided by Seven boundary rider Jude Bolton. \u201cOne day we left Etihad stadium and I jumped in, myself and Dennis with Raj,\u201d Bolton tells me. \u201cI\u2019d eaten something really dodgy at Etihad Stadium during one of the calls and I just turned green. Literally green in the face.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI started getting the cold sweats and I said, \u2018I\u2019m just going to jump out at the first terminal and I\u2019ll walk to our spot.\u2019 And Dennis said, \u2018Whatever you do, don\u2019t do it in Raj\u2019s car.\u2019 So I ended up having to get out of the car and he\u2019s jumped out with me and he\u2019s helped me through it as I\u2019ve just vomited on the side of the road, and he\u2019s handing me water and telling me he hopes I\u2019m alright.\u201d Then, as Bolton gathered his composure, Cometti appraised the scene in signature style: \u201cCentimetre perfect.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cUnbelievable,\u201d Bolton laughs. \u201cJust one of my highlights along the way.\u201d</p> <p>Cometti\u2019s rock star transport arrangements also featured prominently in his colleague Matthew Richardson\u2019s first day in broadcasting, a story that also highlights the fastidiousness of Cometti\u2019s preparation. \u201cI remember rocking up to my first game at Subiaco,\u201d Richardson tells me. \u201cI had a coffee with him the day before. I remember being told to make sure I did my homework, so I had three or four pages of notes and I thought I was going pretty well.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI pulled up in the old yellow cab there outside the gate at Subiaco feeling pretty good about things, but there was a big black limousine in front of me and out jumped Dennis Cometti. He\u2019s always got the sunglasses on and looks immaculate. He\u2019s a very cool-looking man. And here I am with my four pages of A4 notes and he gets out of this black limo with his massive briefcase of notes and immediately I just thought to myself, \u2018Gee I\u2019ve got a long way to go\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>Yet Cometti doesn\u2019t sweat football 24/7, and rarely seeks conversation about the game when he\u2019s off the clock. Richardson says they normally chat about music, pop culture and news. When I speak to Cometti myself we talk at length about gonzo journalism, The Carpenters, various JFK assassination conspiracies and his aborted documentary on the latter, which he\u2019d started tackling in his final year at the ABC.</p> <p>Cometti has diverse reading tastes and a lot of time to indulge them on long-haul flights between Perth and the east coast, on which most colleagues think he also dreams up many of his signature commentary quips. His favourite writers are Hunter S Thompson and PJ O\u2019Rourke, and he revisits Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas every year. It\u2019s rarely noted, but Cometti has been for most of his career a prolific writer himself \u2013 not just his fastidious pre-broadcast notes and Rodney Dangerfieldesque one-liners but newspaper, magazine and online columns, plus books. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/26/tom-wills-grave-restoration-project-reveals-footballs-heart-soul-and-history\">Tom Wills grave restoration project reveals football's heart, soul and history</a> </p> </aside>  <p>If he\u2019s given to invoking the past, with his nods to The Easybeats and Big Bob Johnson, Cometti might also be the least sentimental romantic in the business. He fulfilled radio obligations on the night his father died and read Perth TV news the night his mother passed. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t make me a cold person,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.theage.com.au/news/tv--radio/chris-beck-talks-to-dennis-cometti/2008/05/14/1210444510098.html?page=fullpage#contentSwap1\">he once said</a>. \u201cBut what it does, it probably understands that life and the job run side by side.\u201d</p> <p>Cometti also missed the births of both his daughter Ricki and his son Mark due to work commitments. Mark, now a professional wrestler, was born as his Dad called a Sheffield Shield cricket match (\u201cWe named him Mark, because you\u2019ve never heard of a kid named handpass or kick,\u201d Cometti told listeners).</p> <p>He is avowedly apolitical in his broadcasting, an approach that has had the unintended consequence of courting trouble at times. He was on the mic when Sydney Swans great Adam Goodes performed his famous war dance towards Carlton fans in 2015, and drew stinging criticism for suggesting that he wouldn\u2019t have done it himself before claiming that it wasn\u2019t in Goodes\u2019 best interests either, but he has paused to consider the incident since.</p> <p>\u201cThere was nothing sinister in it,\u201d Cometti says. \u201cI don\u2019t think I fully understood what that was all about. It was certainly going to make him the centre of attention in perhaps a difficult way for him, and it turned out to be that way, although I think in the end he got more support than opposition and that was a good thing.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"682981272fbb87876312f0df9f0c5814179b36f2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/682981272fbb87876312f0df9f0c5814179b36f2/0_83_3781_2270/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Footballer\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dennis Cometti was criticised for his reaction to a war dance performed by AFL legend Adam Goodes against West Coast in 2015.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tony Mcdonough/AAP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI think I said at the time that I wouldn\u2019t have done that, probably at the time not fully understanding what was involved. I didn\u2019t think it was as significant as it perhaps played out to be. But that\u2019s the problem with live television sometimes. It was the opposition cheer squad, so I thought it was provocative in that way, but it was one of those situations looking back that I probably should have bitten my lip.\u201d</p> <p>The question of keeping schtum on his own views is a recurring theme for Cometti, who prefers to remain a neutral observer. \u201cI just don\u2019t think sporting commentary is the place for them, to be honest. That\u2019s just a personal view,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a forum. The audience is certainly widespread in its political views and its views on most things in live in general, so to go too deeply or too far down that track probably does the broadcaster no good, the organisation he represents no good.\u201d</p> <p>To understand Cometti\u2019s reticence on loaded issues like gender and race, and their intersection with sport, it possibly pays to acknowledge the two people who most obviously influenced his early philosophies in life: his mother Dulcie, who was an aspiring novelist when she met Cometti\u2019s father, and his Aunt Esme Fletcher, who opened Western Australia\u2019s first child daycare centre and also a women\u2019s refuge. The strength of the women in his family had an impact on his outlook in life.</p> <p>\u201cI think it\u2019s safe to say that Esme and my mother were feminists, perhaps before feminists were invented,\u201d Cometti once told SBS. \u201cWhat do I think about it? Well I think they were both admirable people. I mean, I agree with what they were on about, there\u2019s no question about that. Sometimes, it needs to be said, they saw men as the enemy and as a young man in that environment you needed to be careful.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMost of what I have I owe to them ... a lot to be thankful for.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>\u2018Dennis will know him back to front because he\u2019s watched the videos\u2019</strong></h2> <p>What they say about Dennis Cometti\u2019s swotting before games is true: for as long as he\u2019s been calling football on TV he\u2019s spent 15-20 hours per week watching game tapes in a room dedicated to the task. Sometimes he sits and makes notes, studying patterns of play or doing reconnaissance on new players. Other times he does a workout as he watches, chugging away on an exercise bike or the treadmill set up in front of the screen. </p> <p>Not only does this habitual process enhance his knowledge of form, tactics and precisely what he can expect from the games he\u2019ll be calling, it pays practical dividends, enabling him to nail the basics like correctly identifying players, a fundamental component of broadcasting expertise in which he often puts younger colleagues in the shade. \u201cSometimes a bloke runs straight at you and you can\u2019t see a number,\u201d notes Drew Morphett. \u201cYou know he\u2019s got blonde hair and bandy legs or something like that, but you think \u2018Who the hell is that?\u2019 if he\u2019s playing game number five or something, but Dennis will know him back to front because he\u2019s watched the videos. Dennis is fantastic at that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s been doing it for so long and his preparation is just second to none,\u201d says Matthew Richardson. \u201cThe amount of work he puts into each game is probably the thing I noticed right from the start and probably something you take away \u2013 that someone who has been doing it as long as him but was still putting in as much time as anyone on the preparation. I guess that\u2019s what makes him so good.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/26/bulldogs-faithful-pray-afl-miracle-wandering\">Bulldogs faithful pray for one more AFL miracle to end the wandering | Craig Little</a> </p> </aside>  <p>However Cometti\u2019s quest for knowledge doesn\u2019t extend to fraternising with players or getting to know them on a personal level. \u201cCertainly I try to avoid planes with teams on them,\u201d he tells me. \u201cObviously there\u2019s not many planes to Adelaide, so you get what you get. I get on well with the teams but there\u2019s so much small talk and you sort of get tired of that.\u201d</p> <p>Sometimes Cometti has taken that separation of duties to a level that amuses colleagues. Morphett remembers waiting for him at Adelaide airport before a Crows game against West Coast. Cometti arrived on the same flight as Eagles players but went missing when Morphett was trying to find him at the baggage carousel. \u201cI\u2019m thinking \u2018where the hell is Cometti?\u2019\u201d he remembers. \u201cAll of a sudden he appears out of the dunny after half an hour. I said \u2018where have you been?\u2019. He says \u2018I don\u2019t like talking to the players. You\u2019re bumping into them all the time\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe flies by his own rules a little bit.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>\u2018Spinning the platters that matter\u2019</strong></h2> <p>It\u2019s impossible to see that an AFL broadcasting talent of Dennis Cometti\u2019s versatility and widespread appeal will emerge from the present media landscape, and now probably unfair to expect it. That\u2019s partly because the culture and times from which Cometti sprang \u2013 the Fleetwood Mac double shots, vaudeville wisecracks and unapologetic schmaltz of 1960s FM radio \u2013 no longer exists. </p> <p>Neither does the regimented ABC of Cometti\u2019s 14-year stint running from 1973 to 1986. On FM radio Cometti found his inner court jester. From the national broadcaster\u2019s Perth offices on Adelaide Terrace, he painstakingly learned his trade as a broadcast journalist from some of the best teachers and practitioners the country has ever produced. At the ABC there were standards to be maintained and structure to be adhered to and a proper way of doing everything; in cricket, batsmen were always named before bowlers. </p> <p>Cometti\u2019s first foray into radio was spinning the platters that mattered for Perth station 6KY, which in the late-60s battled head-to-head with 6PR for the loyalties of Perth\u2019s Top 40 radio listeners. In those formative years there was no rulebook and no internet resources to crib his style from, so Cometti imported cumbersome reel-to-reel tapes of America\u2019s best rock DJs and studied them for hours once they\u2019d finished their six-month sea freight journey to Perth. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"85025c2fea390932b3ef0b03da2a76273371ceb4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/85025c2fea390932b3ef0b03da2a76273371ceb4/318_265_5725_8067/710.jpg\" alt=\"Dennis Cometti\" width=\"710\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A 1980s promotional photograph of Network Seven AFL broadcaster Dennis Cometti.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Seven Network</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Cometti\u2019s first proper radio gig, in mid-1968, fell into place when an old school friend forwarded his \u201cless than sophisticated audition tape\u201d to veteran 6KY announcer Alan Robertson, who in turn got it to the station\u2019s program director John Lehman. The early days were a bit of a lark but not always smooth-sailing. In one gaffe, Cometti mispronounced a live-read ad for an incense boutique, which he described as \u201cspecialising in incest\u201d. For Cometti, each weekend brought the chance to run out onto football grounds alongside Polly Farmer and during the week he was not only lost in music, but in love. In his first summer of broadcasting he also met Velia, who he would marry.</p> <p>But if Robertson taught Cometti the fundamentals of preparing for a broadcast, and instilled in him the idea that he couldn\u2019t just fly by the seat of his pants, he also might have mentioned that nobody in broadcasting is invincible. Between Cometti\u2019s 6KY debut in 1968 and his move to the ABC in 1973, his CV \u201cread like a greyhound bus schedule.\u201d No job was safe.</p> <p>In 1971 a lack of opportunities in Perth sent him to Melbourne, where he balanced an oddball football comeback in the reserves at Ted Whitten-coached Footscray with the weekday night shift and Sundays on 3DB, Victoria\u2019s home of footy, racing and Top 40 hits. For the day job he\u2019d leave training early and jump on the 6:15 to Flinders street. \u201cMr Part-time,\u201d Whitten would call him. Seven or eight reserves games and his best-paid year in radio behind him, he was back in Western Australia.</p> <p>The sidestep into sports broadcasting didn\u2019t come until \u201873 and in unexpected circumstances: a late call-up to play second fiddle to 3KZ footy stalwart Ian Major for the Victoria-WA state game at Subiaco. Soon he was regularly calling games with WA broadcasting star Oliver Drake-Brockman (\u201cOliver could make dogs weep,\u201d Cometti once said). </p> <p>ABC program director Jim Fitzmaurice came after him not long after, with a view to the young gun calling sport full-time. Given the tumult of Cometti\u2019s previous five years the security appealed. \u201cWe were middle class and I was an only child and my mother wasn\u2019t working, so there was, if you like, a realisation that I needed to be careful with my next step,\u201d Cometti tells me.</p> <p>In the following 14 years at Aunty, Cometti refined the impeccable broadcasting habits that would form the basis of his calling style over the next four decades. At the ABC\u2019s Perth headquarters he shared a tiny office with fellow newcomer Drew Morphett. \u201cIt was 12 feet by 20 feet or something like that,\u201d remembers Morphett. \u201cWe lived in each other\u2019s pockets early on.\u201d</p> <p>Cometti was an instant hit. Morphett jokes that having slaved away trying to climb the ladder himself, he was immediately leapfrogged by his new colleague, and was told by Fitzmaurice to work around Cometti\u2019s Sunday league football coaching commitments. \u201cHe was always the favoured son,\u201d Morphett laughs. \u201cHe had it over me right from the word go.\u201d</p> <p>Experienced help was always at hand. \u201cOur superiors were <em>broadcasters</em>,\u201d Morphett says, pointing to Fitzmaurice as a key mentor. \u201cHe was a legendary broadcaster. When Jim tapped you on the shoulder and told you you were ready to go, it was coming from a good source.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe were all taught the basics of broadcasting. He (Cometti) didn\u2019t need much coaching to do football broadcasting because he was a coach and a former player. He got a very early nod to be the ABC\u2019s Test cricket caller on radio. I thought at the time it was a very quick elevation.\u201d</p> <p>Though it was an odd fit at first, Cometti rose to the challenge of calling cricket beside Alan McGilvray and former Test captain Lindsay Hassett during the 1974-75 Ashes, starting a lifetime habit of over-preparing to avoid any chance of being caught short. Each morning he\u2019d arrive with a long list of headlines to work from; weather, the toss, the batting order and other stories of the day. \u201cHe did it almost by indexing,\u201d says Morphett, \u201cso that if he ran out of something to say, he went to the next topic.\u201d</p> <p>To this day, Cometti still tenses up at the start of broadcasts the same way he did back then and delivering the opening monologue to camera has always been something of an ordeal. \u201cEven this year, I think he still probably gets nervous,\u201d says Matthew Richardson. \u201cThat\u2019s probably what makes him so good. He\u2019s not taking any call for granted no matter where it is, whether it\u2019s a big game or a final, or maybe a game between teams on the bottom of the ladder.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/20/from-the-footy-almanac-vault-barry-dickins-remembers-mud\">From the Footy Almanac vault: Barry Dickins remembers mud</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As late as the early 90s, Cometti remained so concerned about nailing his opening lines that he instituted his own homespun autocue. \u201cDennis set up this little system,\u201d says Morphett, who adds that Cometti would be mortified by people knowing. \u201cHe had a piece of dowel. He put it across the lens of the camera and he had two pieces of paper left and right of the lens, and on them he\u2019d have headlines.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe first line would be \u2018Hi, I\u2019m DC\u2019. Second line would be \u2018West Coast v Richmond\u2019. Third line would be, \u2018fighting for a finals berth\u2019 or whatever. I used to say, \u2018why have you got to write down \u2013 \u2018Hi, I\u2019m DC\u2019? It was a piece of wood across the lens of the camera and two foolscap bits of paper. This was just his way of getting under way without making any blues right from the start.\u201d</p> <p>Yet no amount of preparation could prevent the chaos around him. When a nervous Cometti took the chair for his first ever stint at the mic in a Test, during the Perth Test of 1974, he was mortified when he turned and realised his expert offsider Hassett had picked up his trademark pipe and wandered off into the distance for a smoke. \u201cIn many ways that day was helpful,\u201d Cometti later noted, \u201cif for no other reason than to illustrate how isolated and vulnerable broadcasters could be.\u201d</p> <p>Cometti himself has grown into a thoughtful and generous colleague, ever-conscious of injecting his less experienced co-workers into the broadcast and putting them at ease. Before Richardson\u2019s debut broadcast as a Seven boundary rider and knowing he was nervous, Cometti and McAvaney walked down to the fence together and reassured him that he\u2019d be fine. \u201cRight from day one I was made to feel welcome by Dennis,\u201d Richardson says.</p> <p>That extends to the call itself. \u201cHe always throws down to you in a great way and brings you into the conversation with a perfect little lead-in,\u201d says Seven newcomer Jude Bolton. \u201cThat\u2019s made my transition as easy as possible.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hl7y7zlsJqE\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Hl7y7zlsJqE?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Dennis Cometti calls the 2011 Meredith Gift.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Such grace and care for co-callers also helps Cometti\u2019s own image, says his long-time colleague Michael Roberts. \u201cHe\u2019s looking after you, looking after the brand, and looking after himself,\u201d Roberts says. \u201cThere\u2019s blokes that I work with that just get their kicks out of putting you on the spot and getting a laugh out of seeing you stuff up. But Dennis is all about looking after you. He\u2019s a team player. He looks after his team-mates and he makes sure that the brand is winning.\u201d</p> <p>At the ABC Cometti was actually being groomed as McGilvray\u2019s long-term replacement, though his bosses might have known that jig was up when he knocked back a chance to accompany the cricket broadcasting great on an Ashes tour, preferring instead to focus his energies on the WAFL season at hand. It\u2019s rarely mentioned these days but Cometti\u2019s cricket broadcasting days spanned from that fiery 1974-75 Ashes through the World Series schism and the troubled early seasons of the Border years, and he\u2019d also return for Seven in the 1990s, calling Australia\u2019s 1997 tour of South Africa.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb-XKc8Idnw\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/gb-XKc8Idnw?start=240&wmode=opaque&feature=oembed&start=240\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Dennis Cometti calling Australia\u2019s 1997 Test tour of South Africa.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Cricket was also the scene of one of his rare tantrums. Ray \u201cSlug\u201d Jordon once recalled an ABC call of a New Zealand-Sri Lanka one-day international at Bellerive Oval, for which the ABC was provided 30-minute shifts each from the travelling Nine TV broadcast team \u2013 Richie Benaud, Bill Lawry, Tony Greig and Ian Chappell.</p> <p>To get into the broadcast area both sets of callers needed to ascend a narrow and amateurishly-constructed piece of scaffolding, which gave the operation the feel of a tree house. Chairs, desks and broadcast equipment had been lifted into position with a rugged pulley system. Cometti started to baulk. Come the morning shift, Benaud hit his head on the scaffolding as he climbed a rickety ladder. </p> <p>\u201cThat was the end for Richie,\u201d said Jordon, \u201cand Dennis spat the dummy in sympathy. Richie retreated to the luxury of the channel Nine box while Dennis headed back to his hotel room and locked the door.\u201d By 1987, when Cometti departed the ABC to star in Broadcom\u2019s VFL football coverage en route to Seven, his days of schlepping around on a public service budget were done.</p> <p>We forget it now, because his name is synonymous with AFL, but Cometti has been a versatile caller in the past two decades, an adaptability that came from those days at the ABC. His calls of Kieren Perkins\u2019 1500m gold medal and Susie O\u2019Neill\u2019s triumphs at Atlanta \u201896 are classics in the annals of Australian sports broadcasting. As ever, success came from preparation. \u201cHe just did the homework and worked hard at it,\u201d Morphett says. \u201cHe would just find a little corner in the broadcast centre and just be poring over notes and preparing himself perfectly.\u201d </p> <h2>\u2018He was a very quiet man\u2019</h2> <p>If Dennis Cometti will be remembered best for his iconic one-liners, what will be missed most is his voice \u2013 a deep and humming baritone that croons its way through football matches. When Dennis Cometti calls upon his entire vocal range and enunciates it\u2019s as though the words are echoing up from the bottom of a French oak wine barrel.</p> <p>Cometti is not really sure where that voice came from, but says there\u2019s some similarities with his father\u2019s. \u201cHe was a very quiet man,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s not to say he didn\u2019t have a deep, manly voice, my father. It was hardly ever raised in anger or raised in any way. It was just a different time.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t like me getting too loud at the footy and I suppose that tempered my view in terms of when I do the broadcast now. I certainly don\u2019t have any skin in the game. I don\u2019t barrack for teams. As a result I find that helpful. He sort of imbued me with that in the early days when I\u2019d get a little too vocal.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/14/afl-and-nrl-grand-final-entertainment-the-worse-it-is-the-better-it-is\">AFL and NRL grand final entertainment: the worse it is, the better it is | Russell Jackson</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But the Cometti pipes have been passed on his professional wrestler son Mark, who could prove one of football\u2019s great father-son selections if things go right. \u201cHe\u2019s got a better voice than I have,\u201d Cometti says. \u201cI think he\u2019s flirting with the idea of going into broadcasting and I\u2019m trying to help him a little bit at the moment, because he\u2019s back nursing a shoulder injury in Perth. He was supposed to be my superannuation package when I sent him away but now he\u2019s back here.\u201d</p> <h2>\u2018You can have a good time at the footy\u2019</h2> <p>As he crosses the finishing line on a 49-year broadcasting career, Cometti is by such a margin the numero uno of AFL broadcasting that you forget it wasn\u2019t always so. In the late 80s and early 90s there was a perception on the eastern seaboard, quite unfair, that he favoured his home-state West Coast Eagles. At times Seven overlooked him for key finals, and he certainly wasn\u2019t the face of the network\u2019s coverage.<br></p> <p>He first moved to Seven in 1988, the season after his shambolic and strange year with Broadcom, joining the likes of McAvaney, Morphett, Sandy Roberts, Don Scott and Peter Landy as household names in AFL states. Though Seven still has the strongest claim on Cometti, it\u2019s also true to say that through the 1990s, neither they nor the staid nature of sports broadcasting in Australia allowed him to emerge as the universally-loved caller we now know.</p> <p>\u201cThere was no overt \u2018you can\u2019t do that\u2019,\u201d Cometti says of that period, \u201cit was just that you understood the environment you were in, and it was very hardcore football.\u201d </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"f1a80c139743a9b91e388d766ca02a4ef84999fa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f1a80c139743a9b91e388d766ca02a4ef84999fa/298_58_3212_4521/710.jpg\" alt=\"Dennis Cometti\" width=\"710\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A promotional photograph of Network Seven AFL broadcaster Dennis Cometti.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Seven Network</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It was out of the great TV rights war of 2001 that Cometti was able to find a new gear and unprecedented levels of popularity where so many other callers of his generation faded from view or disappeared from our TV screens entirely. Drafted in alongside Eddie McGuire as a star attraction of the Channel Nine team, he spent six years reinventing himself as the most consistently entertaining caller in the business, an evolution in his calling style that Nine encouraged.</p> <p>Cometti likens the transition period to a rediscovery of his lazy late-1960s days out at the footy, when he\u2019d try to make his friends laugh on the banks of Leederville oval in Perth, whose amphitheater design allowed wisecracks to ring out across the ground. \u201cYou can have a good time at the footy,\u201d he says. \u201cNot to the detriment of the game and not pushing yourself up, but a few lines here or there in the course of the afternoon \u2013 particularly if the game is a little dull \u2013 doesn\u2019t add up to much time compared to the game itself.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMy recollections of the footy was that you went and had a good time and you made a lot of smart alec remarks about the players and whatever else might be happening. It\u2019s probably an insight into my personality that I do like to do that. I probably am a bit of a smart alec, which may have come from being in the disc jockey business and trying to be funny. I had no trouble just trying to be me. I felt that sometimes I pulled back from that in the early days at Seven.\u201d </p> <p>By 2008, when Nine lost the rights and Cometti returned to Seven, the network\u2019s bosses were more than happy to let him do his own thing. Entertainment was back on the agenda. \u201cYou can\u2019t be making light of what\u2019s happening too often,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s an interesting line to walk, and you can\u2019t be disrespectful. The contest is the thing. It\u2019s everything.\u201d</p> <p>But what Cometti has learned across his career is that a special kind of relationship develops between commentator and listener, one that needs to be tended to. Some callers, he says, prefer to keep the audience at a distance and not reveal much of themselves, but for Cometti it\u2019s been a gradual process of letting people in. He wants his fans to know him, to see who he is.</p> <p>\u201cSometimes you can watch a bloke on TV for 20 or 25 years and really be none the wiser about who he is,\u201d he says. \u201cThat is not a criticism. That is a choice that someone has made and they can do it very well. I\u2019m of the opinion, if I watch and invest so much time in somebody or something, I would like at the end of that to know someone I\u2019ve spent all that time with a little better.\u201d </p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s how I view a relationship: you\u2019ve gotta let people in. Some people say it\u2019s not a relationship, but I think it is. For me, that was important. To have people say \u2018he seems like a reasonable bloke\u2019. When I finished I wanted to be better known to the people I was broadcasting to, especially if they\u2019d put that time and energy into listening to me. I owe them a debt of gratitude.\u201d</p> <h2>\u2018We don\u2019t live in each other\u2019s pocket but we work in each other\u2019s pocket\u2019</h2> <p>Of course Dennis Cometti\u2019s disappearance from our TV screens means not only the loss of a singular broadcasting talent but also spells the end of his enduring double-act with McAvaney, with whom he\u2019s formed a professional dynamic that will be impossible for Seven to replicate. Dennis and Bruce. Bruce and Dennis. They\u2019re like an old couple, right down to the biscuits McAvaney brings to every game, always from the same shop on Flinders lane.</p> <p>Their longstanding rapport has been possible due to immense mutual respect and the kind of casual comfort among each other that allows them to sit alone at opposite ends of hotel dining rooms without acknowledging one another, lest they stifle their on-air chemistry. \u201cWe\u2019re such good friends we can tell each other to bugger off,\u201d Cometti once said. Another key to their partnership, he thinks, is that they never compete against each other for attention. Each caller knows his role.</p> <p>When I talk to Cometti about the closeness of that bond, I mention a theory floated by ESPN\u2019s Tony Kornheiser about his on-air partnership with his PTI co-host and friend Michael Wilbon; that the secret to the successful on-air partnership is like the old joke made by the Wimbledon groundskeepers when they\u2019re asked how they keep the courts so green: you just start with 5000 years of rain. Cometti laughs. He and Bruce have had their 5000 years of rain, and they\u2019re sad that it\u2019s coming to an end.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s never been a harsh word,\u201d Cometti says. \u201cWe\u2019re good friends. We don\u2019t live in each other\u2019s pocket but we work in each other\u2019s pocket. It\u2019s been a wonderful relationship. I\u2019ve got the utmost respect for him.\u201d</p> <p>For those around them, it\u2019s also the end of an era. \u201cAs long as I can remember, it\u2019s been \u2018Bruce and Dennis\u2019, you know? You can\u2019t replace that overnight,\u201d says Matthew Richardson. \u201cI\u2019m sure it\u2019s irreplaceable really. Not many Dennis Cometti\u2019s come along in broadcasting. I guess it\u2019s like a superstar footballer. They only come along once in a while. I guess it\u2019s going to be the same with Dennis and that\u2019s the challenge \u2013 finding that chemistry up in the box when he does retire.\u201d</p> <p>The only time Cometti seems anything other than comfortable in his decision to call it quits is when he discusses Bruce. \u201cHe is certainly the thing I will miss most from broadcasting footy,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ll treasure it for the rest of my life. I envy my replacement in that regard.\u201d</p> <h2>\u2018I\u2019m starting to punish myself now\u2019</h2> <p>As his final game approaches, Cometti is at pains to point something out: he\u2019s not quitting football broadcasting per se, he is just retiring from travelling. \u201cThe weekend before last I had three games in three states,\u201d he says. \u201cNow a man of my advancing years can\u2019t be doing that too often.\u201d </p> <p>\u201cI just feel that now I\u2019m not enjoying it because of the travel. Once I\u2019m at the ground and being with Bruce and watching the game, and Hamish and Basil on Sundays, it\u2019s terrific. It\u2019s really good fun. I\u2019ve met some great people along the way, and that\u2019s all good and well, but at the same time you think \u2018I\u2019m starting to punish myself now\u2019. At my age it\u2019s probably not the time to be taking the punishment.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s been mooted that he wouldn\u2019t mind calling some local games. \u201cI could wander down to the WAFL and just sit in on the telecast,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019d like that. It\u2019s not everyone\u2019s cup of tea, because not many go to the WAFL, but that\u2019s where my youth is. I\u2019m sort of mired back in the 50s and 60s\u201d. But he\u2019s not so keen on learning nine new team lists and says \u201cit\u2019s all up in the air\u201d for now. </p> <p>\u201cI could see myself being an \u2018expert\u2019 in inverted commas,\u201d he adds. \u201cAs a failed coach I\u2019m perfectly credentialed to do that.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/apr/28/the-joy-of-six-afl-player-coach-feuds\">The Joy of Six: AFL player-coach feuds | Russell Jackson</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Either way Cometti will continue his association with Seven, doing some blogging and filling the odd gap for Western Australian events. His mood after the grand final, he thinks, will depend on how his call has gone. \u201cIf I thought the broadcast has gone well, I\u2019ll probably have a little elation after the grand final, you know, that you got through.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI think I\u2019ve made the choice and I\u2019m comfortable with it. I\u2019m looking forward to the game, but I\u2019m also looking forward to the Sunday night after it when I go out for dinner. I dunno what that tells me. I\u2019ll be happy with the decision.\u201d</p> <p>Cometti is also happy for fans to remember him at his peak, rather than hanging on too long. \u201cA lot of people are talking to me now, saying that it might be a Johnny Farnham retirement,\u201d he jokes. \u201cI use the analogy that sooner or later, if you stay out long enough, forget about Johnny Farnham, you become Meatloaf. So we don\u2019t want to do that either.\u201d</p> <p>And that is more or less that. Though not quite. Just when I think I\u2019m done sifting over Dennis Cometti\u2019s life in broadcasting and finished speaking to the people who\u2019ve sat beside him along the way, a phone call arrives one morning from the man himself. Our conversation has stirred a memory in him and his effort to call back and share it seems revealing of his professional generosity.</p> <p>At this stage Greater Western Sydney are still a decent shot of making their first AFL grand final, and with that in mind Dennis has remembered an anecdote he thinks would work perfectly. In 2011, before the Giants had played a single league game, Cometti was receiving a tour of their training facilities when then-assistant coach Mark Williams roped him into giving the fledgling club\u2019s young players a pep talk. </p> <p>He hadn\u2019t thought of it again until earlier this season when he bumped into Williams again, and the coach thought Cometti would get a kick out of knowing that the Giants had picked a choice phrase out of the motivational spiel and had it plastered over their locker room walls: \u201cYou can go back to the place but not to the time.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 Support our journalism with a <a href=\"https://membership.theguardian.com/au/supporter?INTCMP=mem_au_editorial_cometti_footer\">monthly</a> or <a href=\"https://contribute.theguardian.com/au?INTCMP=co_au_editorial_cometti_footer\">one-off</a> contribution to Guardian Australia</p>",

Remember folks, the FA are the \u201cguardians of the game.\u201d Jesus wept.</p> <blockquote> <p><em><strong>Just how hard was that decision, given it has come so soon in Sam\u2019s reign?</strong></em></p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s been a really painful decision because obviously we\u2019ve only just hired Sam, and Sam we think is a great fit for England manager and we think could have been extremely successful. But The FA is more than just running the England men\u2019s team. We have to stand up for the right behaviours across the whole game.</p> <p>\u201cWe are the guardians of the game \u2013 we set the rules and we have to be seen to apply those rules consistently and evenly, whether you are the England manager or someone low down in the organisation.</p> <p>\u201cThat consistency, that trust that people have in us to behave in the appropriate manner, is core to what any football association is about and certainly true of the English football association. It\u2019s a painful decision because we thought he was a great manager, but it\u2019s the right decision if we are to protect the integrity of The FA.\u201d</p> <p><em><strong>It is a mutual decision. How has Sam taken the news?</strong></em></p> <p>\u201cSam is absolutely distraught. He recognises that he made a terrible error of judgement and I think that he recognises as well that, whilst it\u2019s a tough decision that The FA is taking, he can see that at least we have a point.</p> <p>\u201cOnce again, I have to say how personally disappointed I am. I thought Sam had already made a big difference to The FA \u2013 he came to St. George\u2019s Park and showed real leadership there and had clear enthusiasm for the job at hand.</p> <p>\u201cI know personally that he is deeply, deeply upset and deeply regrets the error of judgement but I also think that he understands why The FA has had to take this tough decision.\u201d</p> <p><em><strong>What happens next? The squad, of course, is due to meet up in less than a week ahead of the games against Malta and Slovenia.</strong></em></p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re in good hands.

But the first thing the duo did was to run it by their partners. \u201cIt was obviously something we discussed,\u201d they say in unison. \u201cMy wife was very excited,\u201d says Segal of his partner of 25 years. \u201cMy background is marketing so I\u2019ve had lots of different clients and challenges.\u201d Millership, who also describes himself as being in a \u201ccommitted relationship\u201d, says his partner was also \u201csupportive about the opportunity\u201d.</p> <p>Biderman was sacked in the weeks after the hack. Much of his legacy has now been unpicked by the pair who had previously worked together on the turnaround of Canadian eSports platform WorldGaming. In July it was announced that Avid Life Media was being reborn as Ruby \u2013 a name plucked from the dictionary because of its \u201csensual, feminine quality\u201d and implied value. The controversial strapline for Ashley Madison was also consigned to the marketing dustbin.</p> <p>While Segal works on the branding side of the business, Millership is focused on operations. The latter says it has invested millions improving the security of its sites, which also include Established Men and Cougar Life. </p> <p> Revenues for Ruby are expected to be around $80m (\u00a361m) this year, down from around $109m in 2015, as the hack exacts its toll.</p> <p>Back in July the company apologised to customers for the Ashley Madison data breach, pledging it was \u201ctruly sorry for how people\u2019s lives and relationships may have been affected\u201d. But in the same breath it got back down to business, promising it had been investing heavily in \u201cprivacy safeguards\u201d and that new \u201csecure and discreet payment options\u201d were now available.</p> <p>The decision to drop its erstwhile USP of extramarital affairs, in a growing market where taste spans the Guardian\u2019s own website Soulmates to Milftastic.com, was based on analysis of its user data. \u201cIt was important to have a voice that spoke to all our members, and what they were looking for, and that was lots of different things: chat, fantasy, kink, threesomes,\u201d explains Segal of the shift. </p> <p>The pair have flown in from their native Toronto to speak at a dating industry conference where the topics include \u201cwhat happens after you both swipe right: a statistical description of mobile dating communications\u201d as smartphone apps make waves in the industry. According to a recent report by market analysts Mintel, the UK\u2019s competitive online dating market is expected to grow from \u00a3165m to \u00a3225m by 2019. </p> <p> \u201cThis is a mature audience that doesn\u2019t need to be hit over the head,\u201d continues Segal. \u201cWe could see that it was polarising to be that graphic and in your face with the message. It was good at spiking the business but was not good for the long-term health of the business.\u201d</p> <p>One of the things Ashley Madison \u2013 named after the most popular girls\u2019 names in the US when the site was launched in the early noughties \u2013 lacks is women, with a ratio of five men to every woman on the site. </p> <p>In the wake of the hack it emerged that many of its female profiles were actually <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/sep/02/ashley-madison-denies-allegations-of-fembot-army\">computer-programmed \u201cfembots\u201d </a>designed to lure men into spending more money. Women can join for free but men, who on average spend $200 a year, pay with credits to chat to them. Millership insists there are no bots on the site today but the company is still dealing with the fallout from last year\u2019s hack with two class action lawsuits and investigations by the Privacy Commissioner of Canada and the US <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jul/06/ashley-madison-ftc-inquiry-hack\">Federal Trade Commission</a>.</p> <p>At the end of his conference talk, one questioner essentially asks how Segal sleeps at night, but he is matter of fact. \u201cPeople ask what kind of guys are you? We\u2019re just two normal guys, we\u2019re marketers and [business] operators who look at this as the challenge of a lifetime.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>There are some things even a billionaire petrochemicals baron can\u2019t control.</p> <p>Jim Ratcliffe, the founder-chairman of Anglo-Swiss firm Ineos, had carefully choreographed the arrival of the company\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/27/first-shipment-of-fracked-shale-gas-set-to-arrive-in-uk\">first shipment of shale gas from the US</a>. Its planned arrival in Scotland was the culmination of a $2bn (\u00a31.5bn) investment designed to make its loss-making Grangemouth plant profitable again, not to mention a high-profile platform to lobby publicly for Britain to launch a fracking revolution.</p> <p>So stage-managed was the event that the Ineos Insight, the tanker that ferried 27,500 cubic metres of ethane from the US, had been moored off the Orkney islands for days at considerable expense, awaiting the party in its honour. Accompanied by the sound of a lone Scottish bagpiper, the Insight slid serenely under the Forth Bridge in the blue dawn light, bound inexorably for Grangemouth.</p> <p>But neither the weather, nor politicians, wanted to dance to the piper\u2019s tune.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The future for manufacturing in the UK will look quite gloomy if we don\u2019t exploit shale</p> <footer> <cite>Jim Ratcliffe</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Moments before the Insight was due to arrive and unload its cargo, the waiting audience was told that it was just too windy to dock. There would be no grand entrance, at least not today.</p> <p>The 20,000-tonne ship wasn\u2019t the only notable absentee. No representative from the Scottish National party, which has placed a moratorium on fracking, had accepted Ineos\u2019s invitation to attend the ceremony marking the renaissance of one of Scotland\u2019s largest employers. </p> <p>Fracking is a controversial process \u2013 it involves blasting dense shale rock with water, sand and chemicals to release trapped gas \u2013 and the SNP is not the only major political party to harbour concerns about the environmental consequences. </p> <p>The SNP\u2019s snub came a day after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/26/labours-pledge-to-ban-fracking-in-the-uk-is-madness-says-gmb\">Labour announced that it would ban fracking</a> if it wins a general election. At least Labour\u2019s intervention gave Ratcliffe an opportunity to espouse what he sees as the virtues of shale gas.</p> <p>The British billionaire hoping to become the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/27/shale-gas-fracking-cement-decline-uk-manufacturing-ineos\">country\u2019s biggest fracker said Labour\u2019s ban would be a spurned opportunity</a>.

About half a dozen of the vocal minority were camped outside the Ineos compound on Tuesday, one playing his own set of bagpipes with impressive flames shooting out of them.</p> <p>In an earlier interview with BBC Radio Scotland, Ratcliffe likened environmental accidents to getting a puncture in a tyre.</p> <p>Friends of the Earth responded angrily, branding the comparison \u201ccavalier\u201d. \u201cYou can fix a puncture in a matter of minutes,\u201d said Friends of the Earth Scotland\u2019s head of campaigns Mary Church. \u201cIt may never be possible to fix groundwater contamination from leaking fracking wells.\u201d</p> <p>Criticism from environmental campaigners is unlikely to worry Ineos once the ethane ships start coming in at a predicted rate of one a week. The firm says this \u201cvirtual pipeline\u201d will allow the plant to make a profit again, just a few years after Ineos claimed it was haemorrhaging \u00a310m a month.</p> <p>Ratcliffe said Grangemouth, near Edinburgh, had been \u201con its knees\u201d before Ineos decided to spend \u00a3450m on the transformation, backed by \u00a3230m in loan guarantees from the government.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/27/fracking-digging-drilling-paris-agreement-fossil-fuels\">No fracking, drilling or digging: it\u2019s the only way to save life on Earth | George Monbiot</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Now, he claims, 10,000 jobs will be supported for at least 20 years, thanks to his grand plan.</p> <p>But while ethane from the US might keep Grangemouth going, it is also part of a lengthy and carbon-intensive journey.</p> <p>Ethane is separated from gas fracked fromPennsylvania before being sent via a pipeline to an export terminal on the US East Coast. There it is cooled to -90C, turning it into liquid for shipping more than 3,500 miles across the Atlantic in \u201cDragon Class\u201d tankers, which burn high emission shipping fuel during a journey lasting about 10 days.</p> <p>Once delivered, the ethane will be fed into \u201ccrackers\u201d which break apart the gas and turn it into ethylene, which is used in a wide range of plastic products, such as plastic bags and \u2013 according to one Ineos man, the packaging for Pot Noodles.</p> <p>The process has been made possible by America\u2019s shale boom, which has yielded so much gas that the world\u2019s largest economy lifted its 40-year embargo on oil and gas exports.

Elephant poaching went from low levels to 33,000 deaths a year between 2010 and 2012. Criminal syndicates made a windfall; local farmers did not.</p> <p>The notion that poor rural farmers are the beneficiaries of any legalised trade is ludicrous. While wildlife stands to lose habitat as Africa\u2019s population grows, uncontrollable commercial trade in ivory and other products is not the answer. We do need unambiguous laws and better law enforcement. But most crucially, we need to stigmatise the use&#xa0;of wildlife products in countries where consumer demand is high.

That\u2019s a fact and we forget it at our peril. And I don\u2019t say this because it\u2019s what wins elections, I say it because it is true. And people know that it\u2019s true. And that\u2019s why it wins elections. </p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He said he expected an early general election.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I\u2019m sure there\u2019ll be a general election soon. The more often Theresa May says it won\u2019t happen, the more certain I am that it will. And, comrades, we need to be ready.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He said Labour could win a general election by building on its achievements in local government.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We owe the British people - our people - an alternative to a government that doesn\u2019t care and a Prime Minster they didn\u2019t vote for. You keep hearing that Labour can\u2019t win, well we can, and we will. And I\u2019ll tell you how we\u2019re going to win: we\u2019re going to win through local government because that\u2019s how we always win.</p> <p>Our councillors are the engine of Labour\u2019s electoral machine. It\u2019s Labour councilors all over the country who are our leaders and ambassadors in local communities. Our councillors and our trade unions: these are the rocks our movement\u2019s built on.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He lavished praise on Labour\u2019s leaders in local government and in the Wales. </strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>What a champion [Sadiq Khan] is. What an outstanding representative of our great national capital and our historic socialist party - still relevant, resonant, and winning elections in one of the most dynamic cities on earth.</p> <p>And in Bristol we have got marvellous Marvin, who you have just heard from.</p> <p>What a hero. And in our other great conurbations next May: Andy Burnham,</p> <p>Si\u00f4n Simon and Steve Rotherham are going to follow Sadiq\u2019s and Marvin\u2019s example. And Carwyn in Wales. Reminding people what Labour government looks like - how innovative and radical we can be. How growth and prosperity, social justice and fairness all go hand in hand under Labour. And not just doing the right thing - not just compassion - but doing the thing right. Competence.</p> </blockquote> <p>Watson\u2019s comments about people like Sadiq Khan and Marvin Rees contrasted strongly with what he had to say about Jeremy Corbyn. He praised Corbyn\u2019s performance at the last PMQs, when he attacked Theresa May over grammar schools, but otherwise his praise for Corbyn was conspicuous by its absence.</p> <ul> <li><strong>He confirmed his plan to set up an independent commission on the future of work.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In the next Labour government we must judge ourself on our ability to redraw that pie-chart. The problems of inequality aren\u2019t new, but the solutions will need to be. So I\u2019ve put together an independent commission on the future of work, to start influencing policy right now - from opposition.</p> <p>It will be chaired by Helen Mountfield QC, joined by a world-class team including Naomi Climer, the first ever female President of the Institution of Engineering and Technology, Professor Michael Sandel, Jon Cruddas, Lord Jim Knight and many more. We\u2019ll feed into Jon Trickett\u2019s work on building a targeted Industrial Strategy and we\u2019ll report back to you next year.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He claimed that the Tories only cared about money and power.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Of the real British values the Tories can never understand; of compassion and fairness alongside enterprise and fierce independence. This is no nation of ideologues. We know that and that\u2019s our advantage over the Tories.</p> <p>They\u2019re blinded by money and power. It\u2019s all they care about. And the old lady next door; and your neighbour\u2019s children; and that migrant family working 60 hours a week and paying taxes: all these can go hang to the Tories. Other people don\u2019t matter. Well that\u2019s not the British way.</p> <p>Yes, British people want a fair chance for themselves and their families. They want their hard work rewarded. But they also care what happens to the other children in the class, the other people at the bus stop, the others in the lengthening queues waiting months now for life-saving operations.</p> </blockquote> <p>That\u2019s all from me for today.</p> <p>Thanks for the comments.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"181b4c82c43cd25ac24fb55be3bcc8dc1d1cbc1f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/181b4c82c43cd25ac24fb55be3bcc8dc1d1cbc1f/0_255_4954_2972/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tom Watson addressing the Labour conference.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tom Watson addressing the Labour conference.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Furlong/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-09-27T17:15:23.596Z\">at 6.15pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57ea8fdee4b08ca277ca0c28\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-27T16:09:03.464Z\">5.09pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Jeremy Corbyn's interviews - Summary</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Jeremy Corbyn </strong>has done a round of interviews with broadcasters this afternoon. Here are the key points.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Corbyn said he would hold a shadow cabinet reshuffle next week.</strong> It would not be this week, he said, but it would come before parliament resumes a week on Monday.</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I will be appointing ahead of the return of Parliament to ensure that we have an effective shadow cabinet. We are filling the positions, but we are not announcing anything this week. It is all going to come later on.</p> </blockquote> <p>Corbyn also hinted that the reshuffle might not involve filling all 60-odd vacant frontbench jobs. He said he would \u201cdevelop a team of the size that we need\u201d. But there is no absolute requirement for the shadow ministerial team to be as large as it was. In the past oppositions have functioned with fewer shadow ministers than they normally have now.</p> <ul> <li><strong>He claimed that \u201clots\u201d of MPs would return to the front bench. </strong>\u201cLots of MPs are coming back,\u201d he said.</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>He restated his opposition to bringing back full shadow cabinet elections. </strong>Asked if he would agree to them, he said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I didn\u2019t vote for it. I\u2019m open to the idea and I understand the argument behind it, but I also think the leader of the party must have the ability to form the general policy areas.</p> </blockquote> <p>But, despite saying the party leader had to have some right to determine policy direction, he also reaffirmed his commitment to extending party democracy.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I think intrinsically, members need to have much more say in policy making for the longer term. That means we have to engage much earlier on. </p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He said there might be a \u201cspecial meeting of the policy forum\u201d later this year to consider proposed changes to party rules.</strong> Labour\u2019s national executive committee is expected to discuss these proposals, covering policy making and the selection of the shadow cabinet, at a meeting in November.</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>He said he accepted that Labour\u2019s policy was to back Trident - while also suggesting it could change in the future.</strong> He also reaffirmed his personal opposition to nuclear weapons.</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The policy the party has from previous conference decisions does support the renewal of Trident. As you know, I never agreed with that decision ... That\u2019s the existing party policy. I cannot predict what will happen in the future, who will decide what they want to bring forward to conference.</p> </blockquote> <p>He also said that he wanted to \u201clead this party in a direction will bring about a nuclear free world.\u201d (In their speeches to the conference yesterday Clive Lewis, the shadow defence secretary, and Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/sep/26/labour-conference-john-mcdonnell-speech-says-labour-will-run-interventionist-government-politics-live?page=with:block-57e8f854e4b03598d1ce8b89#block-57e8f854e4b03598d1ce8b89\">both stressed Labour\u2019s commitment to multilateral nuclear disarmament </a>- suggesting that this might be a compromise policy around which Labour\u2019s pro and anti-Trident factions could coalesce.)</p> <p>Asked if he \u201caccepted\u201d party policy, he replied:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Of course I know what the party policy is and of course I understand the decision that was taken. Does it mean there are people in the party who have a moral objection to nuclear weapons? Yes there are.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He said he never wanted to use a nuclear weapon</strong>. Asked if he would fire a nuclear weapon, he replied: \u201cI never want to use a nuclear weapon.\u201d This is as less provocative answer than the one he gave last year, when asked on Today if he would press the nuclear button. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2015/sep/30/labour-conference-jeremy-corbyns-morning-interviews-politics-live?page=with:block-560b8d2be4b00e76364a24d8#block-560b8d2be4b00e76364a24d8\">On that occasion he bluntly said no, </a>prompting pro-Trident MPs to claim that he had rendered the nuclear deterrent worthless. </li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>He played down the nature of the row with Clive Lewis about the wording of his speech.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It\u2019s perfectly normal that there be discussions with shadow cabinet colleagues on statements they are going to make, and that\u2019s what happened. It was discussed and that\u2019s what came out of it. I don\u2019t see it as a huge problem, I don\u2019t see it as a huge issue.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He rejected claims that Sadiq Khan\u2019s speech was directed at him.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>How is that a lecture to me? It was a lecture to everybody that we have to come together to get in power ... What he was saying was we have to win a national election. On that we are all agreed.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He said it was wrong to treat socialism as a dirty word.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Socialism is the basis of what brought the Labour Party about, it\u2019s the basis of what forms our opinions. It\u2019s actually the basis of why we got the NHS. The Labour Party has won lots of elections ...</p> <p>Stop treating the word `socialism\u2019 as if its some sort of bad word we should only talk about late at night. It\u2019s an ideology that\u2019s based on the principle that everyone should contribute and those in need should benefit the most from our common endeavours.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He rejected claims that Labour was not reaching out to ordinary voters.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>How is a message that is about making sure that everyone in this country has a living wage, that there is real job security, that we end zero hours contracts, that we invest in infrastructure, railways and broadband, schools and hospitals \u2013 how is that not a message that reaches out to millions of people all across this country?</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He said that he had changed the political agenda.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I tell you what \u2013 the political agenda has changed \u2013 Everyone\u2019s against austerity now, they weren\u2019t a year ago.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He said he would tackle concerns about immigration partly by trying to standardise living standards across Europe.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>What I would do about immigration is try to bring about a degree of co-terminosity, a degree of equality of work conditions and wages across Europe.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"450b6c11771c87569a69e04543f977c340c7dad0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/450b6c11771c87569a69e04543f977c340c7dad0/0_164_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jeremy Corbyn.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jeremy Corbyn.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Nicholls/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-09-27T16:30:27.589Z\">at 5.30pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57ea8d13e4b04cbd30bc3a59\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-27T15:25:31.615Z\">4.25pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Angela Rayner vows to fight extending grammar schools with 'every breath in my body</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Angela Rayner,</strong> the shadow education secretary, spoke earlier.

She has produced no evidence that grammar schools help social mobility. Selection - or segregation as it should be called - entrenches division and increases inequality ...</p> <p>Conference, Theresa May is telling fairy tales about social mobility and opportunity. Selection is toxic. It tells a clever child they are stupid, strips a child of self-esteem and embeds inequality. Every child has potential. Every child can succeed. No child should be left out or left behind. </p> <p>Conference, Tony Blair talked about education, education, education. Theresa May wants segregation, segregation, segregation. And our Labour Party will fight it, starting on Saturday when we launch our nationwide campaign against more grammar schools. We\u2019re going to take the fight to the Tories and I appeal to all my MP colleagues to help lead this fight. Together, we can defeat Theresa May.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>She confirmed that she was setting up a childcare taskforce.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>That is why I am proud to announce today, Labour\u2019s new childcare taskforce, to help us transform early years provision for every family in the 21st century. And I\u2019m delighted that Liz Snape, the deputy general secretary of Unison, who you heard from this morning, has agreed to chair that taskforce, working with Labour\u2019s shadow education team and childcare experts.</p> <p>Our aim will be to provide the care and support for every child to fulfil their potential, and to help parents back to work. Access to affordable, high-quality childcare and early years learning is one of the most effective drivers of social mobility.

Flynn, a leftwinger, has spent most of his career on the backbenches as a member of the awkward squad but he was appointed to the shadow cabinet in the summer when the resignations happened. Flynn doubles up as shadow Welsh secretary and shadow leader of the Commons. His promotion was all the more remarkable because he is 81.</p> <p>Flynn started with a joke about his age. He was speaking as a \u201cgrateful recipient of Jeremy\u2019s job creation scheme for geriatrics\u201d, he said. But his speech, which he delivered in his capacity as shadow leader of the Commons, contained some strong lines.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Flynn appealed to the Labour MPs who resigned from the front bench to return.</strong> He said he disagreed with Len McCluskey, the Unite general secretary, who gave <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/sep/26/labour-conference-john-mcdonnell-speech-says-labour-will-run-interventionist-government-politics-live?page=with:block-57e92dc5e4b01a7059fc9dac#block-57e92dc5e4b01a7059fc9dac\">a speech yesterday saying the \u201cmerchants of doom\u201d should quit. </a>Flynn said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Len McCluskey made a speech for unity yesterday but there is one phrase in it - the one that he stole from Shakespeare - that I must disagree with, because he did say \u2018some should depart the field\u2019. No, no, no.</p> <p>We\u2019ve got some of our best people sitting on the subs bench, you don\u2019t score goals from the subs bench. Some resigned, they all did for honourable reasons. It took courage for many of them to resign, it\u2019s going to take greater courage for many of them to come back and we must make it possible for them to return with dignity and respect.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He said Labour should abandon negativity.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In the last 12 months we\u2019ve been locked in a gap year of negativity, of pessimism, of hopelessness, by many in our party. It seemed at times a competition to see who could be the most pessimistic about our future and our prospects - we\u2019ve got to end that. It\u2019s time to now to give unity a chance. Take all the bile and the hatred together, put it in a box, bury it deep underground, put six feet of concrete on top and then put a sign saying \u2018never should the last 12 months be unearthed from its dishonest grave\u2019.</p> </blockquote> <p>Flynn insisted that Labour could win. To back his point, he recalled helping out during the 1945 general election campaign with his brother. He was only 10 at the time, but he remembers his mother telling him he was wasting his time. She told him:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Look, boys, you are on the right side, it\u2019s the Labour party, it\u2019s our party, but this candidate cannot win because of prejudice. You cannot win in Wales as a candidate if you\u2019ve got an Irish name. And no one called Jim Callaghan has any future in politics.</p> </blockquote> <p>Callaghan was elected MP for Cardiff South in 1945, and of course went on to become prime minister.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Flynn claimed that Labour had enjoyed \u201cmarvellous results\u201d in elections over the last year.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The trouble with unity is that it is not sexy. The media, the press, are not interested in it. They are interested in rows, they are interested in division, they are interested in conflict. But they don\u2019t notice the brilliant year we\u2019ve had: magnificent election results. Instead of the polls, look at what happens when real people use real votes in real elections. Marvellous results in all the mayoral elections, in all the byelections. In Wales we gained three parliamentary seats that we lost a year ago.</p> </blockquote> <p>Flynn seems to be using the word \u201cbrilliant\u201d rather loosely. For a more accurate assessment of Labour\u2019s electoral record over the last year, read <a href=\"http://ukpollingreport.co.uk/blog/archives/9749\">this UK Polling Report blog by Anthony Wells.</a></p> <ul> <li><strong>Flynn mocked David Cameron\u2019s resignation honours list.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The Daily Mail, of all people, described his honours list as devalued, debased, discredited, egregious, grubby, tawdry, tainted, tarnished - otherwise alright. </p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He said Britain needed \u201croot and branch reform of our democracy\u201d.</strong> But reform needed to happen by cross-party agreement, he said.</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The only House in the world where we have chieftains, hereditary chieftains in parliament, is ourselves and Lesotho. Only another country, Iran, has clerics as lawmakers. We need a thorough reform of our democracy. It must be done on an all-party basis. It must be done with the consent of all parties so that we get a fresh democracy that\u2019s fair, that\u2019s durable, that\u2019s democratic. </p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bfc67b57c7706845e4fe5f00a861438d40725b6a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bfc67b57c7706845e4fe5f00a861438d40725b6a/0_75_3776_2266/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Paul Flynn addresses the Labour conference.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Paul Flynn addresses the Labour conference.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: James Gourley/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57ea7422e4b04cbd30bc39bf\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-27T13:30:36.796Z\">2.30pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Wendy Nichols,</strong> who is chairing the afternoon\u2019s session, has just told delegates that Iain McNicol, the Labour general secretary, has ensured that the stand giving away free copies of the Sun will take them away.

It was a tribute to the way, during the London mayoral campaign, Khan relentlessly and unashamedly kept going on about his upbringing at every opportunity. It worked, because there is not a soul in London who does not know what Khan\u2019s dad did for a living. Khan is someone who understands the importance of repetition.</p> <p>But this speech took the art of repetition to a whole new level. At times it was veering into self-parody. Essentially, almost every sentence was about how Labour can only achieve things if it is \u201cin power\u201d. It certainly wasn\u2019t subtle, and some will accuse him of overkill, but if Khan\u2019s only concern was to get his message across, then it was certainly effective.</p> <p>And what was the message? Khan backed Owen Smith in the leadership contest because he thought Jeremy Corbyn could not win an election. He explained his thinking in an Observer article. In his speech today Khan did not criticise Corbyn directly, and he specifically said that the leadership issue was settled. But he did not retract anything he said during the summer. His focus on the importance of Labour being able to win elections to get things down could be seen as a firm reminder to Corbyn that he will be judged by electoral performance, but it sounded more as if Khan was advertising his own credentials as an election winner. He seemed to be putting down a marker for the future, signalling that if Labour needs an election-winner when the Corbyn era is over, Khan will be available.</p> <p>Here are the key points.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Khan said Labour should focus on winning power.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>After the election this summer the leadership of our party has now been decided and I congratulate Jeremy on his clear victory. Now it\u2019s time for us all to work together towards the greatest prize: getting Labour back into power.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He stressed that Labour was in power in local government and in Wales, if not at Westminster.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>With Labour in power, Britain is a fairer country - a more equal country and a more just country. And Labour is in power right now - not just in London but in Wales too. Labour re-elected with the First Minister, Carwyn Jones, and in Bristol with the new Mayor, Marvin Rees. Labour is in power right now in Liverpool, Manchester and Southampton; in Newcastle, Glasgow and Cambridge; in Birmingham, Nottingham, Leeds and Cardiff too.</p> <p>Labour is in power in towns and cities the length and breadth of Britain. And Conference, where Labour is in power it\u2019s thanks to your hard work. Thanks to Labour members, activists and supporters. Thanks to the trade unions and the working people they represent. Thanks to the Labour staff who work so hard for us.<br></p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He explained why being in power was so important.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>With Labour out of power, the number of affordable new homes built falls, the cost of rent rockets, and the number of homeless people sleeping on our streets rises. But it\u2019s only with Labour in power that we can make tackling the housing crisis our number one priority; we can create new teams like Homes for Londoners, to get more genuinely affordable homes built; or a new social letting scheme to stop renters being ripped off; we can enact new policies like the London Living Rent to put home ownership back within reach for our young people; and we can make tackling homelessness and rough sleeping a real priority - because it\u2019s a stain on our great nation.</p> <p>Most of the speech consisted of Khan making this point again and again, but applying it to issues like housing, air pollution, social integration, inequality, education, Brexit and the public services.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He stressed that EU citizens in Britain are welcome.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I\u2019d like to take a moment to speak to the European citizens living across Britain, and who make a huge contribution to our NHS, schools, on construction sites and in business: you make a massive contribution to our country; economically, socially and culturally. Thank you. Thank you for all that you do to make our country great.

In the Conservative Party, where the overthrow of leaders is an art form nurtured and treasured over two centuries, we would never have made this error. The rule of thumb is that it takes a good two years for a party to despair even of a very unsuccessful leader. By jumping the natural starting gun, the moderates left some Labour members able to say that their leader was still new and hadn\u2019t been given a chance.</p> <p>Third, that premature challenge was not spearheaded by a real alternative. Owen Smith was not only unprepared for the fight but offered merely a less doctrinaire version of Corbyn himself, rather than a different vision of Labour\u2019s future. Thus the central argument about the whole direction of the party was never fought out, and the leadership election actually shifted the terms of Labour\u2019s debates further to the Left.</p> </blockquote> <p>Ironically, on one point at least, Hague\u2019s analysis is identical to John McDonnell\u2019s. <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/media/2016/07/watch-john-mcdonnell-labels-labour-rebels-fing-useless\">McDonnell famously said the Labour plotters had been \u201cfucking useless\u201d.</a></p> <ul> <li><strong><a href=\"http://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/comment/labour-remains-stuck-as-the-world-moves-on-5zc6v0wdx\">Rachel Sylvester in the Times (paywall) says Labour as a party is out of touch with modern Britain.</a></strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The truth is that Labour\u2019s biggest problem is not Mr Corbyn himself but the fact that the world has moved on and the party has not. Although its battles are conducted on Twitter and Facebook, it is still an analogue organisation in a digital age. Even its name looks like an anachronism. This is a party of \u201cthe workers\u201d, which grew out of the trade union movement but which has failed spectacularly to understand that the nature of work has changed over the past 30 years.</p> <p>The number of self-employed people is predicted to overtake public sector workers by 2018 as the internet transforms the way business is done. About 16 per cent of people in this country now work for themselves \u2014 up from 8.7 per cent in 1975 \u2014 and it\u2019s a trend that will only accelerate with the rise of automation.</p> <p>The self-employed will be an ever more powerful economic and political force, but Labour has nothing to say to these voters. Its policies on full employment or workers\u2019 rights are irrelevant to them and its statist solutions are likely to be anathema to this instinctively individualistic group. These are not all thrusting entrepreneurs setting out to become millionaires by setting up their own companies. Many are freelancers cobbling together jobs, or people making a part-time living through the sharing economy \u2014 Uber drivers or those renting out a room on Airbnb. To the extent that it thinks about them at all, Labour sees them as victims of corporate exploitation, but many like the flexibility and control they get from being their own boss. They do not think of themselves as \u201cthe workers\u201d; in fact work is not their defining identity at all.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong><a href=\"http://morningstaronline.co.uk/a-1d3c-The-Tories-grammar-school-policy-would-take-us-back-to-the-1950s#.V-pPBSMrJZ0\">Angela Rayner, the shadow education secretary who left school without any good GCSEs, tells the Morning Star in an interview she has encountered a \u201csneer of arrogance\u201d from Tories.</a></strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>[Rayner\u2019s] combative Commons displays on the subject have seen her become a front-bench favourite of Labour members.</p> <p>And the passion she exudes for education and the party will ensure a packed hall for her speech today.</p> <p>It will be a very different reception to the \u201csneer of arrogance\u201d she has encountered from the Tory benches since taking the role. \u201cI think some of them think: \u2018What does she know, she wasn\u2019t educated, she says it herself.</p> <p>\u201cBut actually I\u2019ve got a masters in real life and I know from the evidence this is bad for our kids.\u201d</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57ea42b8e4b0f707b26af49b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-27T10:06:06.825Z\">11.06am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>In the debate on the NEC rule changes <strong>Mike Katz,</strong> from the Jewish Labour Movement, complained that the party was not doing more to tackle antisemitism.

Jeremy [Corbyn] has said it, Tom [Watson] has said it, we have all said it; there is no place for this in our party. We must root it out. </p> <p>Against this backdrop, is there any wonder that support for Labour amongst British Jews is said to be as low as 7%. It makes me weep; the party of Manny Shinwell, the party that has done more than any other to promote tolerance and inequality, the party to which the Jewish Labour Movement has been affiliated since 1920, is not seen as a welcoming home for Jews. </p> </blockquote> <p>Katz said that Corbyn had acted to address antisemitism, but he said that measures to specifically tackle antisemitism should have been included in the rule changes being voted on today.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57ea3b41e4b08ee6d0d2f3d0\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-27T09:52:53.661Z\">10.52am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">The 15 national executive rule changes - Details</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The national executive committee\u2019s rule changes are controversial because they include plans to let the Labour leaders in Scotland and Wales nominate one person each to sit on the NEC. Kezia Dugdale, the Scottish leader, and Carwyn Jones, the Welsh leader, are both seen as opponents of Jeremy Corbyn, and Corbynites fear this rule change will result in the anti-Corbyn faction on the NEC getting too extra votes. Currently Corbyn has a small majority on the NEC on some issues, but it is finally balanced. The Corbynites wanted the new Scottish and Welsh NEC representatives to be chosen by party members, which would probably have led to Corbyn supporters being elected.</p> <p>But some of the other changes are quite significant. Here is a full list of what they are.</p> <p>1 - Clarification that a sitting leader does not need to be nominated by 20% of MPs and MEPs to stand in a leadership election if challenged. This change is being introduced because the current rules are ambiguous. Labour\u2019s NEC decided that Corbyn could stand in the leadership contest without getting fresh nominations, but because the rules were not 100% clear, a Labour member took the party to court in an unsuccessful attempt to get that decision overturned.</p> <p>2 - Clarification of for how long someone needs to have paid affiliation fees to attend a CLP AGM (60 days).</p> <p>3 - Tightening of rules allowing the party to exclude people convicted of serious offences from joining, to include people subject to rulings from civil courts relating to their behaviour. This is intended to ensure Labour can exclude people who might be a threat to children but who have not been convicted of a criminal offence.</p> <p>4 - Giving the national women\u2019s conference a formal role in policy making.</p> <p>5 - Toughening up penalties for Labour groups that do not follow gender balance rules.</p> <p>6 - Banning Labour councillors from voting for an illegal budget.</p> <p>7 - Obliging Labour mayors and police and crime commissioners to report to Labour organisations and conferences.</p> <p>8 - Changing the way Labour councillors pay a levy to the party.</p> <p>9 - Adding two members to the NEC, a frontbench member of the Scottish parliament nominated by the Scottish leader and a frontbench member of the Welsh assembly nominated by the Welsh leader.</p> <p>10 - Allowing the Scottish and Welsh leaders to attend the Clause 5 meetings that determine the party\u2019s election manifesto.</p> <p>11- Putting the Scottish and Welsh executives in charge of deciding their own Westminster candidates.</p> <p>12 - Putting the Scottish and Welsh executives in charge of setting rules for the selection of candidates for the devolved bodies.</p> <p>13 - Putting the Scottish and Welsh executives in charge of setting rules for the selection of council candidates in Scotland and Wales.</p> <p>14 - Formalising the posts of Scottish deputy leader and Welsh deputy leader.</p> <p>15 - Formalising the new rule changes affecting Scotland and Wales.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57ea3af8e4b0a785ec48be49\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-27T09:26:16.660Z\">10.26am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>At the Labour conference <strong>Andy Kerr</strong>, a member of the national executive committee, is now opening the main debate on the proposed national executive committee rule changes.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57ea3609e4b08ee6d0d2f3b7\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-27T09:08:50.120Z\">10.08am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Paddy Lillis</strong>, the NEC chair who is chairing this morning\u2019s session, called a vote on a show of hands on whether to agree a \u201creference back\u201d so that delegates could vote on all 15 proposed rule changes separately. There were loud protests when he did not agree a card vote, but Lillis said there was a clear majority against a reference back. <strong>Manuel Cortes</strong>, the TSSA general secretary who proposed a reference back, then came to the stage to protest, saying party rules said there should be a card vote. Lillis over-ruled him, saying it was clear from the show of hands who won.</p> <p>Now that\u2019s over it is seems certain that the proposed rule changes will be agreed quite comfortably.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57ea3157e4b08ee6d0d2f3ab\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-27T08:47:54.506Z\">9.47am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The Labour conference has opened, and there will be a debate on the proposed changes to party rules (including giving Scotland and Wales a seat on the national executive committee). But, being the Labour party, at first they are having a debate about who to hold the vote. Labour HQ wants a single \u2018take it or leave it\u2019 vote on all 15 proposed rule changes. But some delegates are now arguing for individual votes on each measure.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57ea2cdee4b0a785ec48be11\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-27T08:42:50.062Z\">9.42am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Labour conference backs call for possible referendum on final Brexit deal</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>There were not many policy issues that divided Jeremy Corbyn and Owen Smith during the leadership contest but one was Europe. Corbyn said the party should accept the Brexit vote, and focus on getting the best possible deal. Smith said that any final deal should be put to the public, in a second referendum or a general election, and that he would like the UK to stay in the EU.</p> <p>Interestingly, the Labour party conference has backed the Owen Smith position. There has not been a formal debate on Brexit at the conference, but yesterday\u2019s economy debate included various composite motions on employment rights, including one proposed by the TSSA union. It was passed unanimously, and no one paid much attention to the detail, but it included a line saying the UK should retain the option of staying in the EU.</p> <p>Here is the key passage.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>[Conference] recognises that many of those who voted to leave the EU were expressing dissatisfaction with EU or national policy and were voting for change, but believes that unless the final settlement proves to be acceptable then the option of retaining EU membership should be retained. The final settlement should therefore be subject to approval, through parliament and potentially through a general election, or a referendum.</p> </blockquote> <p>In practice, the significance of this is limited. According to party officials, the fact that the composite was passed does not mean that demanding a possible second referendum is now official party policy. Instead the motion will feed into the national policy forum policy-making process. And in practice Corbyn\u2019s election victory means he has a mandate for his \u2018it\u2019s settled\u2019 position.</p> <p>But the fact that conference has passed this motion will embolden those Labour MPs, like Smith, who are demanding a second referendum. And if the Commons ever ends up voting on amendments to Brexit legislation demanding a second referendum, as seems inevitable, Labour MPs will be able to use composite 1 as justification for backing those amendments.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-09-27T09:00:22.322Z\">at 10.00am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57ea1520e4b0a785ec48bdb7\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-27T08:05:22.315Z\">9.05am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Labour does not feature much on the newspaper front pages this morning although, given<a href=\"https://twitter.com/suttonnick/status/780517261501198336\"> </a>the splash headline on one of the few papers that does lead on Labour, Jeremy Corbyn may consider that a blessing. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/suttonnick/status/780517261501198336\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Tuesday&#39;s Daily Mail front page:<br>Labour in la-la-land<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/tomorrowspaperstoday?src=hash\">#tomorrowspaperstoday</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/bbcpapers?src=hash\">#bbcpapers</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/hjgkCbCMOs\">pic.twitter.com/hjgkCbCMOs</a></p>&mdash; Nick Sutton (@suttonnick) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/suttonnick/status/780517261501198336\">September 26, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>If you\u2019re interested, you can read how the Mail explains its headline<a href=\"https://twitter.com/suttonnick/status/780517261501198336\"> here.</a></p> <p>Our coverage is rather different. You can read most of our conference stories <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour\">here.</a></p> <p>In the past Tuesday at Labour conference has always been the day of the leader\u2019s speech, but this year Jeremy Corbyn is doing what most other party leaders do and using his keynote speech to close the conference. The advantage of this arrangement, for all political leaders, is that the speech gets reported in full, but the media can\u2019t then spend the next 24 hours prowling the conference finding party members to slag it off. Instead Tom Watson, Labour\u2019s deputy leader, gets to take the Tuesday afternoon slot.</p> <p>Here is a round-up of the overnight Labour conference stories.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Tom Watson, Labour\u2019s deputy leader, will say that the party must develop policies to stop automation harming workers.</strong> Announcing the launch of an independent commission into the future of work, Watson will highlight research saying that more than a third of workers think their job security will be harmed by automation, while a fifth think it will hit their wages. He will tell the conference:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>New automated technologies are fusing with the internet, and creating models of work and jobs we haven\u2019t seen before. Daily we hear stories of machines and systems that can do things we thought only humans could do - driving cars, drafting contracts, even composing music. </p> <p>It\u2019s been called the fourth industrial revolution - a new era of fast, technology-driven change, which we\u2019re beginning to feel in everything we do. </p> <p>And it\u2019s uncertain because it isn\u2019t yet fulfilling its potential to change working lives for the good - we aren\u2019t seeing it. Too many people whose grandparents were trade unionists with secure jobs are now working 60-hour weeks, below the minimum wage, without any support from a union. The dark side of the gig economy.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>Diane Abbott, the shadow health secretary, will tell the conference in her speech later that Labour will rescue the NHS.</strong> She will unveil various proposals, including: focusing more on public health and preventative health care; prioritising mental health services; and ending \u201cdamaging\u201d competition and marketisation in the NHS, \u201cremoving the private sector where it is ripping-off the NHS\u201d.</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, will tell the conference in his speech that the party must focus on winning power</strong>. Saying that the leadership issue is now settled (Khan backed Owen Smith, not Corbyn), he will say:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It\u2019s only with Labour in power that we can create a fairer, more equal and more just Britain.</p> <p>Labour out of power will never, ever be good enough ... The people who need us the most are those who suffer the most when Labour is not in power.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>Angela Rayner, the shadow education secretary, will say every parent should have the right to quality, afforable childcare <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-37475733\">in her speech to the conferrence. </a></strong>She will announce a review of childcare provision and early-years education.

Getting it right will improve the life chances of countless children across the country.

  "<p>Tristan und Isolde, we are often told, is one of the truest measures of a grand opera company\u2019s resources. It takes a formidable orchestra, a visionary conductor, a hardy cast of supple singers. Less frequently itemized in this array of requirements is a director possessed of useful ideas \u2013 but that\u2019s also important, as the Metropolitan Opera\u2019s strange new misfire of a production makes clear.</p> <p>This season in New York, we have soprano <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/may/02/nina-stemme-brunnhilde-ring-cycle\">Nina Stemme</a> giving a high-powered, gorgeous account of Isolde \u2013 and some ravishing Wagnerian orchestral sweep driven by conductor Sir <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/simon-rattle\">Simon Rattle</a>. Both of those musicians are too infrequently heard here. Unfortunately, they are laboring in and around a concept by director <a href=\"http://culture.pl/en/artist/mariusz-trelinski\">Mariusz Treli\u0144ski</a> that isn\u2019t anywhere close to their mutual level of artistry. Judged by the ear, Monday\u2019s premiere was a marvel. By the eye, it was a nearly five-hour parade of unforced errors. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/sep/23/tristan-und-isolde-wagner-opera-met\">Why Wagner's Tristan und Isolde is the ultimate opera</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Directorial license in the world of opera takes place between two poles of extremity. One one side, there is the lighter touch. This less-controversial style involves activist moves that nevertheless seek to harmonize in some way with opera as it has been historically understood. These directorial interventions might include putting the action in a new century, using modern dress, or adding some \u201cframing device\u201d \u2013 not in the interest of revising the drama, but rather to make its poetry more readily approachable in the moment. The opposing approach might be called the \u201crewrite\u201d style, wherein the historical intention of the work holds no particular authority, and can thus be stretched, tortured or abandoned at will. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"810d328b14ec3fc7487b44fe0c6ffac646175f96\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/810d328b14ec3fc7487b44fe0c6ffac646175f96/0_0_4050_2700/1000.jpg\" alt=\"scene from tristan und isolde\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The prodiction is \u2018overwhelmingly dark\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ken Howard/KenHoward/MetropolitanOpera</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The overdetermined darkness and cynicism of this production falls in the latter bucket. For those who won\u2019t brook any form of directorial liberty-taking, that will be enough to dismiss it. But as someone who has been persuaded by aggressive rethinks at other times, I think it\u2019s important to describe why Treli\u0144ski\u2019s would-be radical approach seems so poorly conceived. </p> <p>The first ill omen was the opening prelude, during which the music was pushed from its usual starring role into one of accompaniment \u2013 a mere backdrop to a visual pattern of a modern warship\u2019s radar signal, rotating clockwise (over and over).</p> <p>This image impressed, at first, as simply pedestrian and ugly. With its insistent presence over the ensuing three acts, the visual tic did not manage to endear itself. Yet it was just the opening gambit in Treli\u0144ski\u2019s fruitless straining for gothic urgency. Other video motifs introduced during the first act prelude included a lunar eclipse-like black orb that floated among barren trees in a dark wood. There were also glimpses of a spectral figure in a military outfit. (Alternately, he was gripping a gun, or else a head of a child, close to his chest.) We saw a humble wood-plank abode dissolving into fire and ash. </p> <p>None of Treli\u0144ski\u2019s iconography was in a hurry to make itself coherent, in relation to the story of Tristan und Isolde. In fact, the director primed the audience to misread some of his preferred visual cues, for hours. (Elements from that opening montage also introduced the subsequent two acts, just to make extra certain that every viewer would remember to ponder them.) When the brilliant bass <a href=\"http://www.renepape.com/\">Ren\u00e9 Pape</a> entered as King Marke, his crisp white military outfit seemed to recall the suicidal figure in Treli\u0144ski\u2019s opening video sequence. But that also made no literal dramatic sense, since in the libretto it\u2019s clear that he has no children. (Also: King Marke wouldn\u2019t live in a wooden shack.) Unless the child he\u2019s gripping close is the fate of his nation? And the burning house a symbol of \u2026 something?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"66730eff6241b6726ce245679c50942b3638e8a5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/66730eff6241b6726ce245679c50942b3638e8a5/0_0_2700_3814/708.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018By trapping Tristan so completely within an unresolved daddy drama, the opera\u2019s more adult-oriented obsessions are severely blunted\u2019\" width=\"708\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018By trapping Tristan so completely within an unresolved daddy drama, the opera\u2019s more adult-oriented obsessions are severely blunted.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ken Howard/MetropolitanOpera</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>If this all seems far removed from the world of thought and emotion typically inspired by a good performance of Tristan und Isolde \u2013 well, yes. Finally, in the third act, when Tristan is laid up from a mortal wound and raving in the absence of Isolde, Treli\u0144ski allows us the interpretive key to his imagery. As Tristan recalls learning of his father\u2019s premature death, the director has a physical replica of the video-depicted, burned-up house wheeled on to the stage. Tristan gambols through the ashes of memory, uncovering his father\u2019s sullied uniform. So it was Tristan who was the child in all those videos. In Treli\u0144ski\u2019s version, he watches his father commit suicide, rather than learning of the death via a mournful melody that Wagner\u2019s score and libretto present in more poetic detail.</p> <p>That the director prefers to make his own pictures take precedence over the sounds and words of the opera is, in itself, notable. More important \u2013 and more quizzical \u2013 is the fact that director has elected to make an opera-wide fetish out of such a minor point in the work. The great length we have to travel for a reveal of such jaw-dropping inconsequence is just one mark of how turgid and unrewarding this staging can feel.</p> <p>Another major problem with this vision of the opera is the demotion of Isolde that it enforces by necessity. By trapping Tristan so completely within an unresolved daddy drama from childhood, the opera\u2019s more adult-oriented obsessions with death and carnal longing (and their mixture) is severely blunted. Accordingly, tenor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/may/25/exclusive-video-stuart-skelton-and-heidi-melton-perform-the-love-duet-from-tristan-and-isolde-eno\">Stuart Skelton</a>\u2019s honey-voiced portrayal of Tristan doesn\u2019t have much in the way of chemistry with Stemme\u2019s Isolde. At first, I thought this a deficit in Skelton\u2019s acting. By the third act, the production\u2019s overall hostility to the erotic was more clearly to blame. In the end, Skelton was reduced to being propped up like a lifesize stuffed animal \u2013 blank and expressionless, in death as in life \u2013 while Isolde slashed her wrist and sang the Liebestod. (Marvelously, for all that mattered.)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"72b8d2cc1e15234b015b3bf189c1446b8347acd9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/72b8d2cc1e15234b015b3bf189c1446b8347acd9/0_0_3848_2700/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Stemme gave a lustrous and controlled reading of the role.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"702\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Stemme gave a lustrous and controlled reading of the role.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ken Howard/KenHoward/MetropolitanOpera</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It\u2019s not that there\u2019s nothing to new to say about Tristan und Isolde. It might be possible for a production to offer a point of contrast with the romance that is undeniably there in the music (despite its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/sep/23/tristan-und-isolde-wagner-opera-met\">famous chromaticism and general adventurism</a>). I can imagine a world in which a director might make some kind of interesting point about the contradictions that are inherent in the pursuit of love during wartime. Or a staging that engages philosophically with the fact that the lovers\u2019 fevered affections are inspired by a potion, in the first instance. But Treli\u0144ski\u2019s cynical take doesn\u2019t have anything detailed to offer, save for a juvenile rejection of the work\u2019s charms. There\u2019s no synthetic argumentation, just a stark refusal to do justice to the balance of light and dark that is present in the opera.</p> <p>That Stemme gave such a lustrous and controlled reading of all her act three music seemed like a sort of implicit protest against the cheap grimness of this production. Upon encountering her already dead Tristan, she asks whether she will be denied a chance to at least luxuriate for another hour in the problems they faced together (\u201cNicht meine Klagen darf ich dir sagen?\u201d).</p> <p>It might as well have been a question posed to Stemme\u2019s director \u2013 the same artist who, in act two, set the lovers\u2019 exultation on a portion of the ship that looked like an early George Lucas sketch for a Death Star observation deck, and who staged another rendezvous in a cavern of the vessel otherwise dedicated to storing chemical refuse. (There were audible laughs in the audience when one of the chemical drums was knocked over and hit the stage with the sound of an oversized dodgeball falling to the floor in an elementary school gym.) Rattle worked with Treli\u0144ski where he could, building to some climaxes with a halting, noir-like approach \u2013 whereas <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/apr/15/james-levine-retiring-metropolitan-opera-house-best-moments\">James Levine</a> might have privileged a greater sense of flow. But at other junctures, Rattle departed from the tenor of the staging and let the music sing the way its composer intended.</p> <p>The opening night audience was not confused about what worked and what did not. The singers, who ranged from good to great, received commensurate ovations. Pape got a big one \u2013 which he\u2019d earned by imparting a real sense of injury and emotional stakes during his features. Mezzo-soprano Ekaterina Gubanova started out a bit underpowered in the role of Brang\u00e4ne \u2013 but by the time of her more fervent debates with Isolde, the singer held her own alongside Stemme\u2019s force-of-nature voice. Rattle and Stemme were both duly appreciated.</p> <p>Upon their curtain call, the production team inspired a blend of less-forceful applause and some hearty booing. Voices of disapproval at the premiere of a new production aren\u2019t new, of course. Nor are they always correct. In the past, I\u2019ve encouraged Met patrons to give chancy stagings <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/apr/24/un-ballo-in-maschera-review-passion-and-piotr-beczala-make-verdis-epic-sing\">an honest try</a>. Last season, I enjoyed Treli\u0144ski\u2019s sly presentation of Tchaikovsky\u2019s Iolanta alongside Bartok\u2019s Bluebeard\u2019s Castle. But his Tristan amounts to a feverish squandering of elite operatic resources.</p>",

As I have said, the decision of the British people to leave the EU is not symptomatic of looking inwards but a people who want to take more control over our laws, our money and our borders.\u201d</p> <p>Amid globalisation, the UK must be \u201cfree to help shape an even more transparent, more open and more liberal trading environment\u201d, he argued.</p> <p>Fox\u2019s address was <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/09/24/liam-fox-britain-will-be-great-again-after-brexit/\">briefed in advance to newspapers</a> at the weekend as a \u201cmajor\u201d speech that would help begin to outline the UK\u2019s trading position in the wake of leaving the EU.</p> <p>However, political opponents said the trade secretary, who attracted criticism earlier this month <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/10/business-leaders-politicians-attack-fox-over-lazy-accusations\">for describing UK businesses</a> as \u201clazy and too fat\u201d, had said nothing of any real note.</p> <p>Tim Farron, the Liberal Democrat leader, said the contrast between the briefings and the actuality meant Fox was confusing businesses \u201cby sending mixed messages about our membership of the single market\u201d.</p> <p>Farron added: \u201cClearly, Liam Fox is incapable of speaking for our government or country; he is a second-class cabinet minister enjoying first-class travel around the world.\u201d<br></p> <p>Chuka Umunna, the Labour MP who chairs the Vote Leave Watch campaign, which aims to scrutinise the Brexit process, said: \u201cFor Liam Fox to brief the Sunday papers that he would give a major announcement, before delivering bland platitudes today, showcases the total confusion at the heart of government on this issue.\u201d</p> <p>Tensions within the Conservatives over whether Brexit should see the UK leave the single market were highlighted last week when the former chancellor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/23/george-osborne-brexit-won-majority-hard-brexit-did-not\">George Osborne warned against</a> a \u201ctake-it-or-leave-it bravado\u201d in negotiations with the EU.</p> <p>Theresa May has been at pains to prevent her ministers outlining potential visions of how Brexit might happen before the government forms a coherent plan. </p> <p>Earlier this month Downing Street was quick to stress that a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/06/david-davis-single-market-stance-not-government-policy\">prediction by David Davis</a>, the secretary of state for exiting the EU, that Britain was unlikely to remain in the single market was very much his own view. </p> <p>On Tuesday, the former pensions secretary and avowed Tory Brexiter, Iain Duncan Smith, dismissed Osborne\u2019s argument that the 23 June referendum did not necessarily endorse a hard Brexit.</p> <p>Writing for <a href=\"http://www.conservativehome.com/thecolumnists/2016/09/iain-duncan-smith-sticking-to-the-plan.html\">the ConservativeHome website</a>, Duncan Smith said Osborne was wrong to portray himself as \u201cthe representative of the liberal mainstream majority\u201d.</p> <p>He added: \u201cAfter all, the British people voted to take back control of their borders, their money and their laws; that seems pretty mainstream to me.\u201d</p>",

Net-a-Porter had 20 brow products three years ago; now, it has <a href=\"https://www.net-a-porter.com/gb/en/d/shop/Beauty/Makeup?pn=1&amp;npp=60&amp;image_view=product&amp;navlevel3=Brows&amp;dScroll=0\">150</a>.</p> <p>New brow advances include eyebrow transplants and microblading, a kind of tattooing where tiny strokes of ink are added to resemble hairs, a treatment that lasts up to three years. Beauty service booking app <a href=\"https://www.treatwell.co.uk/\">Treatwell</a> reports that HD Brows and microblading are growing in popularity. Treatwell\u2019s beauty director, Liz Hambleton, says HD Brows is in the top 10 most booked treatments in Liverpool. Tinting and threading searches are up 50% nationwide on 2015.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"12591f03a4aec82d2eff2cfeace0adfccd1ebc80\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/12591f03a4aec82d2eff2cfeace0adfccd1ebc80/199_311_2935_1760/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Desperate Scousewives gave us the much-maligned Scouse brow.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Desperate Scousewives gave us the much-maligned scouse brow.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Channel 4 Picture Publicity</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Eyebrows have a corresponding new visibility in popular culture. In 2014, a <a href=\"https://vine.co/v/MTFn7EPvtnd\">Vine</a> by American teenager Peaches Monroee went viral with the phrase \u201ceyebrows on fleek\u201d, referring to eyebrows looking particularly fabulous. There are more than three million <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/brows/?hl=en\">Instagram posts with #brows</a>, and more than 600,000 with <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/browsonfleek/?hl=en\">#browsonfleek</a>. There are more than 500,000 tutorials on YouTube, all with different diagrams on how to get your brows on fleek. One, by makeup artist <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGjR2aqkbVQ\">Zukreat</a>, has been viewed more than three million times.

If Bernice\u2019s bob defined the 1920s and Twiggy\u2019s eyelashes were the 60s, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/cara-delevingne\">Cara Delevingne</a>\u2019s eyebrows will surely go on to signify the decade we are in now. It is thanks to Delevingne \u2013 or Her Eyebrowness, as she is called in September\u2019s Vogue \u2013 that young women everywhere now have a brow icon. The Delevingne brow sits low on the face, is long, extending towards hairline and nose, and darker than your hair. \u201cShe brought brows to the masses, and it\u2019s been so powerful,\u201d says Bailey. \u201cThey\u2019re a bit oversized, but the way she has embraced them and made them a good thing has made women want natural brows.\u201d</p> <p>Delevingne is not the only brow reference. There\u2019s the scouse brow, a much-maligned strong eyebrow seen on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2011/nov/25/desperate-scousewives-boss-entertainment\">Desperate Scousewives</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/the-only-way-is-essex\">The Only Way Is Essex</a>\u2019s tattooed eyebrow, almost as much part of Amy Childs\u2019 look as the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2OLZO4Tvm8\">infamous vajazzle</a>.

There are the pencil-like styles of Marlene Dietrich in the 30s, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/audrey-hepburn\">Audrey Hepburn</a>\u2019s thick eyebrows to emphasise her doe eyes in the 50s, glossy brows on Marie Helvin in the 70s and bushy brows on Brooke Shields in the 80s. When I was growing up in the 90s, it was all about the pencil-thin look, and celebrities such as Pamela Anderson or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/drew-barrymore\">Drew Barrymore</a>. I duly plucked mine to almost nothing and proceeded to draw them on, in kohl. The noughties went further. The likes of Sophie Ellis-Bextor or model Lara Stone had squeaky-clean skin with brows as an afterthought.</p> <p>Over the 20 years since then, I\u2019ve laboriously, painstakingly grown mine back. If, once, brows were an afterthought of beauty, they are now a focus. Alice Casely-Hayford, the 27-year-old fashion and beauty editor of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/nov/23/refinery29-launch-uk-site-sarah-raphael-id\">Refinery29</a>, says features on brows are universally popular on the site because \u201cpost-Cara, everyone cares about their brows. I don\u2019t wear that much makeup, but I religiously get my brows done every 30 days. It\u2019s my biggest beauty extravagance and heaven forbid she [the beauty therapist] takes off too much.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ae764699196c2f63dbc13e502c6b2f9203cdd33f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ae764699196c2f63dbc13e502c6b2f9203cdd33f/10_696_1599_959/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Marlene Dietrich\u2019s pencil-thin look in 1944.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Marlene Dietrich\u2019s pencil-thin look in the 40s.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Everett/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The variety of brow appointments are astonishing. At <a href=\"http://nailsandbrows.me/\">Nails &amp; Brows</a>, Sherrille Riley\u2019s salon in Mayfair, the appointments are booked up for months in advance for Sylvia Delbar, who is in possession of a pair of beautiful, glossy black eyebrows peeking out over glasses. For an appointment called a \u201cbrow makeover\u201d, she tints my brows, threads the area, and generally provides brow wisdom. Delbar is originally from Iran where, she says, with only slight irony: \u201cEyebrows are our life.\u201d My eyebrows come out looking smart, more groomed, but also natural.</p> <p>At <a href=\"http://www.browhaus.com/\">Browhaus</a>, a chain that started in Singapore, I go for a consultation for the \u00a3550 \u201cbrow resurrection\u201d, a semi-permanent, vegetable-dye treatment. At the Covent Garden salon, therapist Chermaine Patia, who herself has square-edged, precise brows, gives me an idea of what my brows would look like resurrected, with skilful use of pencil and knowledge of the geometry of brows \u2013 lining up the corner of my nostril to make my nose look smaller, and aligning the \u201ctail\u201d of the brow to the outer corners of the eye. The result is closer to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/nov/02/simply-nigella-bingo-lawson-bbc\">Nigella Lawson</a> \u2013 thick and wider than in their natural state.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"c6ea95a723c6f7a51c03732be8a6a9ce20764652\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c6ea95a723c6f7a51c03732be8a6a9ce20764652/0_197_3615_3614/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Audrey Hepburn\u2019s thicker brows emphasised her doe eyes.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Audrey Hepburn\u2019s thicker brows in the 50s emphasised her doe eyes.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hulton Archive/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>HD is the ultimate in the celebrity-like brow \u2013 as the No 1 salon brow brand in the UK, with clients including <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/rita-ora\">Rita Ora</a>, Nicole Scherzinger, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/ellie-goulding\">Ellie Goulding</a> and <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/nick-grimshaw\">Nick Grimshaw</a>. It was set up in 2008 by The X Factor makeup artist Nilam Holmes Patel (Twitter handle: @EyebrowQueen) and became associated with the strong, glam brows seen on Towie. Brow trends have changed since then, and it\u2019s now all about the \u201cfluffy brow\u201d, using all the tiny hairs to create a more natural finish. At the Notting Hill salon, full of women with designer handbags, therapist Rebecca Morris says Delevingne and model Chloe Lloyd (a woman with serious brows, and more than 200,000 followers on <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/chloelloyd/?hl=en\">Instagram</a>) are the most common eyebrow icons. Morris gives me the 45-minute treatment, which costs \u00a340 and involves tinting, waxing, threading, tweezing and filling in with two types of pencil. There are three colour choices for dark hair like mine \u2013 the Bombshell, the Foxy and the Vamp. My eyebrows, post-HD makeover, are now a defined, Instagram-ready statement. Most of Morris\u2019s clients have this treatment every two weeks.</p> <p>If the very English Delevingne is one face of brows, the general aesthetic could suggest there is a widening of the beauty ideal beyond blonde and caucasian. As Delbar suggests, brow beauty has long been a focus in the Middle East. \u201cThreading and the heavy brow has heritage in the Asian and Arab communities where there isn\u2019t really a history of the thin brow,\u201d says Anna-Marie Solowij, beauty editor and co-founder of site <a href=\"http://thisisbeautymart.com/\">Beautymart</a>. \u201cThose cultures have shaped, strong brows.\u201d Bailey describes the Middle East as an influence: \u201cIt is so interesting for me to go there. Brows have been huge there for such a long time.\u201d He namechecks Kuwaiti-based beauty blogger <a href=\"http://www.dalalid.com/\">Dalalid</a> \u2013 with 1.8m followers on Instagram and avatar-like brows \u2013 as one of his top influences. Meanwhile, at Browhaus, Patia says the so-called Korean brow \u2013 a straighter, but still strong look \u2013 is becoming popular.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ce9dafdc6b338d92ff5744db67215e639767bf2b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ce9dafdc6b338d92ff5744db67215e639767bf2b/0_312_5000_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lauren Cochrane has her eyebrows enhanced at High Definition Beauty Boutique Notting Hill London Photograph by David Levene 20/9/16\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lauren Cochrane has her eyebrows enhanced at High Definition Beauty Boutique, Notting Hill, London.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Levene/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Women of Indian descent dominate the brow industry, partly because threading originated in India. Vaishaly Patel, the woman credited with popularising threading in the UK, has Indian parents, as does Holmes Patel. <a href=\"https://www.shapesbrowbar.com/\">Shapes</a>, a brow threading bar worth more than $14m (\u00a310.8m), was set up by Indian-born Reema Khan. Blink Brows\u2019 Vanita Parti, whose parents are from India, is profiled in the most recent issue of <a href=\"http://thegentlewoman.co.uk/\">the Gentlewoman</a> magazine. She says most of the therapists at her 22 brow bars are Indian or Nepalese.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I don\u2019t think my niece who is in the fifth grade will ever pluck her own eyebrows</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Age is also a factor in the brow boom \u2013 or the sweet spot on a Venn diagram where thirtysomething women out to thicken their brows (notably more youthful than a thin or sparse brow) meet the post-Delevingne generation that has ditched the tweezers and gone straight to the salon. \u201cI don\u2019t think my niece who is in the fifth grade will ever pluck her own eyebrows,\u201d says Bailey, \u201cand not just because she\u2019s my niece. Young girls are being warned by their mothers who overtweezed in the 90s.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s lots of debates on forums about whether girls who are 15 or 16 should get Brazilian waxes,\u201d says Solowij. \u201cIt is a moot point, really, because they are, along with blowdries and mani-pedis. You can put brows into that.\u201d At all the salons I visit, the therapists say teenagers are now regulars, although they won\u2019t give them treatments until they are 16.</p> <p>In 2005, Ariel Levy wrote in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/feb/18/highereducation.news2\">Female Chauvinist Pigs</a> about teenage girls\u2019 dressing and grooming not as a hobby but \u201cas a kind of Sisyphean duty\u201d to engage \u2013 and keep \u2013 the attention of men. More than a decade later, with the advent of social media in the mix, the perceived necessary grooming levels have increased. Treatwell\u2019s Hambleton admits: \u201cThere\u2019s an increasing pressure on women and men to look groomed at all times.\u201d Contouring \u2013 a makeup technique first practised by drag artists to feminise features using shadow and concealer \u2013 is now standard for twentysomethings who grew up watching reality TV stars on Towie and Keeping Up with the Kardashians, and consuming a constant stream of Glam Squad-created \u201cselfies\u201d on Instagram. Are brows part of a cartoon-like femininity designed for a phone screen rather than IRL?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cd5330b6c16ffaa4e82cc6d8854c0488acea876d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cd5330b6c16ffaa4e82cc6d8854c0488acea876d/571_52_3143_1885/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Selfie queen Kim Kardashian with power brows.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Selfie queen Kim Kardashian with power brows.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Desmond Boylan/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Victoria Anderson, a researcher at Cardiff University who writes about social media, believes brows are a part of the power play underlying every selfie. She points to the Latin for eyebrow \u2013 supercilium. \u201cIt is the root of \u2018supercilious\u2019, a way to be superior and look down on other people,\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s mapped into the selfie culture, where there\u2019s an image to let other people see that you have status and power in the world.\u201d The profile of the eyebrow and the selfie have no doubt grown side by side in the 2010s, with selfie queens such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/kim-kardashian\">Kim Kardashian</a>, Kylie Jenner and Delevingne all in possession of power brows, but Anderson sees the connection between brows and power going back to Dietrich\u2019s day. \u201cAll of these women were about control of their image,\u201d she says. \u201cWith those Hollywood women, there was a weight behind them. Without wanting to sound judgmental, there\u2019s a lot of emptiness in these images [selfies].\u201d</p> <p>If this is some of the cultural symbolism of brows, they are \u2013 for most women \u2013 the minimal toe-dipping into this extreme beauty world. \u201cWomen are aware they will be perceived and judged at any time and that\u2019s not just the male gaze, it\u2019s the peer gaze,\u201d says Anderson. \u201cEyebrows are about power and self-definition.\u201d Most women I know have a brow story, and a preoccupation. They\u2019re the discussion topic around bar tables \u2013 a kind of beauty obsession that might be part of an objectified Identikit face designed for men but, on their own, not something generally on the male radar. \u201cMy friends who have no interest in fashion are engaging with beauty more, especially brows,\u201d says Refinery29\u2019s Caseley-Hayford. \u201cFalse lashes and lip fillers, as seen on the Kardashians, are not for everyone. But everyone can do their brows.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Shadow chancellor John McDonnell has called on the government to end uncertainty over Brexit, amid claims it is causing some big businesses to engage in \u201ccorporate bullying\u201d by refusing to pay smaller firms.</p> <p>Speaking to a gathering of small businesses at the Labour party conference in Liverpool, McDonnell said he suspected the government would enact article 50 \u201ctowards the end of next year\u201d, but that a lack of direction was having a detrimental impact on small business.</p> <p>Martin McTague, policy director for the Federation of Small Businesses (FSB), claimed larger firms had stopped paying suppliers in order to protect themselves against a possible Brexit backlash.</p> <p>McTague said: \u201cThere is almost an element of corporate bullying. After Brexit a lot of large companies decided they needed to boost their balance sheet so they made a unilateral decision not to pay their suppliers. I think that is scandalous.</p> <p>\u201cThe government has introduced a proposal which is trying to address that but it is a major problem for many of our businesses.\u201d</p> <p>McDonnell said the lack of clarity over Brexit was creating problems for businesses. \u201cMy own view [before Brexit] was that the economic consequences wouldn\u2019t be felt immediately but would be incremental, with the undermining of certainty and confidence in our economy.<br></p> <p>\u201cSo far there\u2019s been an uncertainty in government in terms of who\u2019s leading on what and who\u2019s taking the decisions, and also what the negotiating timetable is.</p> <p>\u201cPeeping down letterboxes and whispering through keyholes at No 10 it looks as though they\u2019ll be looking to trigger the article later next year rather than sooner, due to the outcome of various European elections which are being awaited.\u201d</p> <p>McTague said the FSB wanted to secure the \u201cbest possible Brexit deal\u201d for small business, which included access to the single market.</p> <p>McDonnell said he believed that although membership of the single market would be preferable, simple access was the more realistic prospect. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/26/john-mcdonnell-10-an-hour-living-wage-plan-labour-conference\">John McDonnell announces \u00a310 an hour living wage plan</a> </p> </aside>  <p>During a question and answer session, one small business owner, Gary McDonnell of catering company Empty Plates, claimed he had lost almost \u00a350,000 due to companies changing their name in order to avoid having to pay him. </p> <p>He said: \u201cIt\u2019s daylight robbery.

It\u2019s not so much about our desire to suppress wages but our members need time to adjust to the changing environment.</p> <p>\u201cOne example that was brought to me recently is a company supplying the automotive industry. They\u2019re on a declining contract so they have to cut costs every year. If at the same time the government is increasing those costs you\u2019re going to get a lot of companies going out of businesses.\u201d</p> <p>McDonnell said a policy review body would look at introducing \u201ccompensatory measures\u201d for small business. He said: \u201cThe last thing we want to do is introduce a living wage that has a detrimental impact on jobs.</p> <p>\u201cBut what we can\u2019t have is a situation where we\u2019re in the fifth richest economy in the world and children are in poverty even though both of their parents are in work.\u201d</p> <p>McTague said a study by the FSB had revealed confidence among its membership had fallen this year for the first time since 2012, blaming uncertainty over Brexit and general concerns about the underlying health of the UK economy.</p> <p>He added that although 55% of members said they were optimistic about the future, the impact of big business postponing investment was \u201cfiltering down\u201d.</p> <p><strong>Sign up to become a member of the Guardian Small Business Network </strong><a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/small-business/\"><strong>here</strong></a><strong> for more advice, insight and best practice direct to your inbox.</strong></p>",

That is hardly surprising, given that Mr. Trump has taken a particularly bellicose stance towards Mexico. And he has repeatedly talked about pursuing more protectionist trade policies, which would be bad news for Mexico\u2019s open and US-dependent economy.</p> <p>In the first instance, a victory for Mr. Trump on 8th November would probably cause the peso \u2013 and indeed most emerging market (EM) currencies \u2013 to weaken against the US dollar. And uncertainty regarding future trade policy, including a possible re-negotiation of the NAFTA trade accord, could weigh on the Mexican currency and ensure that it remains volatile.</p> <p>But we do not believe that the worse fears of protectionism will be borne out...And once the dust settles on the US election and a probable Fed rate hike in December, we would not be surprised to see the peso stage something of a comeback in the next couple of years, as prior structural reforms help economic growth to finally build momentum. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57ea8c6be4b04cbd30bc3a55\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-27T15:12:59.937Z\">4.12pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>And maybe there isn\u2019t an oil deal after all:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/HermsTheWord/status/780783664393314304\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Iran&#39;s Zanganeh emerges from meeting with Russia&#39;s Novak.

Jasper Lawler, market analyst at CMC Markets, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The price of oil dropped on Tuesday, leaving the price of Brent crude within the $46-$48 range it has been in for the last week in the lead-up to the meeting in Algiers. The drop came as Iranian oil minister Zanganeh indicated that Iran was not willing to freeze oil output at current levels. More interestingly Zanganeh said Iran is targeting its pre-sanctions oil market share of 12-13%.</p> <p>The assumption had been that Iran was targeting 4m barrel per day, but 12-13% of a higher OPEC total output since Iran was sanctioned implies a higher figure.

Carlo Mareels, a credit analyst at MUFG Securities, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We don\u2019t see any immediate catalysts that could change the uncertain outlook on Deutsche Bank and the weakness in Deutsche Bank spreads is hard to reverse in the absence of proper constructive news on the capital story. Profitability will remain challenging but capital is certainly the most pressing factor right now.</p> <p>We believe that the sub and senior will be subject to volatility but that they are essentially money good. On the AT1s [CoCo bonds] our central scenario is that they won\u2019t switch off coupons, but it can\u2019t be ruled out. We still see risk as significant and that needs to be priced in. However, if the Department of Justice\u2019s fine is in the area of $6bn or higher, our view is that a capital raise will become necessary (which would most likely be very beneficial to the AT1s). </p> </blockquote> <p>ABN Amro analysts believe significant restructuring is required:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Equity investors are fearful they will have to be called upon to support the capital position of the ailing Deutsche Bank (DB), as equity prices are down 64% since October 2015....</p> <p> Crucially, despite restructuring, continual low and even negative net income quarters are draining the ability DB has to naturally increase its capital position. Their capital position needs to be improved, and the ability of it to achieve this naturally is being severely questioned. Significant restructuring, including major asset sales, will likely be needed if DB wishes to achieve an increased capital position without calling on shareholders.</p> <p> The delayed sale of DB\u2019s stake in Hua Xia will be vital to help facilitate a suitable capital position for this year end. However, this is not a silver bullet and would only add a temporary \u20ac1.6bn uplift to [its Tier 1 capital ratio]. So more is needed...</p> <p>The payment request from the DoJ is just the tip of the iceberg of issues surrounding DB, as a number of other litigation suits remain open. The potential fines dwarf the \u20ac5.5bn DB have set aside for litigation. </p> <p>AT1 coupons are potentially at risk dependent on the timing/amount of the recent DoJ fine. Anything over \u20ac6bn will cause real problems for the payments. At present, we believe, the bank could weather short term capital issues for AT1 write-downs not to be an issue... In February DB were adamant in protecting their AT1 investors, but it is something that may not be so happy with going forward as already embattled equity holders would get stung for providing this benefit.</p> <p>The going concern for the company should be maintained provided the payment of the litigation charges is not demanded in the short term. We see a demand for the fines to be paid urgently as an unlikely scenario.

  "<p>How to combat the age-old problem of ageism in Hollywood? More female directors? Less of a gender pay gap?

  "<p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <h2>Round one: Achieving Prosperity</h2> <p><strong><em>Clinton</em></strong><br></p> <p>Hillary Clinton focused early on policy, laying out an economic agenda that called for reducing income inequality by raising the minimum wage, closing the gender pay gap and eliminating corporate tax loopholes. But she did not miss the opportunity to go after Donald Trump for being the first major-party nominee in more than 40 years to refuse to release his tax returns.</p> <p>The Republican candidate managed to put his Democratic rival on the defensive on the Trans-Pacific Partnership, forcing her to explain why she came out against the landmark 12-nation trade agreement last year after previously supporting it. But Clinton was able to overcome the question in part because Trump repeatedly shouted over her attempts to answer it \u2013 placing the focus instead on his aggressive posture. <strong>SS</strong></p> <p><strong><em>Trump</em></strong></p> <p>Donald Trump was strongest early in the debate, when he hit familiar talking points on trade and put Clinton on the back foot, having to defend her flip-flop on TPP and the controversial legacy of Nafta, the free trade agreement signed by her husband that many in the industrial midwest feel has cost manufacturing jobs. An off-key rehearsed line from a stilted Clinton about \u201cTrumped-up trickle down economics\u201d represented a brief window into what the debate might have been like if Trump had been able to act like a normal candidate for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/27/debate-clinton-trump-recap-presidential-election-hofstra\">more than 10 minutes</a>.</p> <p>But the Republican nominee took Clinton\u2019s bait and played defense on personal attacks almost immediately. After Clinton said: \u201cHe started his business with $14m, borrowed from his father,\u201d Trump immediately responded, rather than turn the focus back on to trade, perhaps his strongest issue. <strong>BJ</strong></p> <h2>Round two: America\u2019s Direction</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/sep/26/donald-trump-video-debate-birther-obama\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/54pf4\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2754571\"            data-video-name=\"Donald Trump defends 'birther' stance: 'I think I did a good job' \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"Reuters\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57e9e357e4b0a785ec48bd23\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/09/27/160926birther_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/09/27/160926birther.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/09/27/160926birther_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/sep/26/donald-trump-video-debate-birther-obama\">Donald Trump defends \u2018birther\u2019 stance: \u2018I think I did a good job\u2019</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p><strong><em>Clinton</em></strong></p> <p>Arguably Clinton\u2019s strongest segment of the debate was when the discussion turned to race in America. The Democratic nominee, who holds broad support from African American voters, navigated the complex issue of police brutality by placing the emphasis on restoring trust between law enforcement and communities of color.</p> <p>Clinton walked through an expansive criminal justice plan, which included more resources for police training but also the need to end mass incarceration. But beyond that policy, she put forth a unifying message that asked Americans to acknowledge the systemic barriers against minorities.</p> <p>Wisely, when the topic shifted to birtherism \u2013 the conspiracy theory that Barack Obama was not born in the US \u2013 Clinton did not engage in a debate on the subject.

Eventually, the Republican nominee boasted: \u201cI think I did a great job and a great service not only for the country, but even for the president, in getting him to produce his birth certificate.\u201d <strong tabindex=\"-1\">BJ</strong></p> <h2>Round three: Securing America<br></h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/sep/27/clinton-trump-debate-stamina-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/54ph9\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2754630\"            data-video-name=\"Clinton hits back after Trump attacks her 'stamina' at debate \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"AP\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57e9eb53e4b08ee6d0d2f2d6\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/09/27/160926stamina2_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/09/27/160926stamina2.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/09/27/160926stamina2_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/sep/27/clinton-trump-debate-stamina-video\">Clinton hits back after Trump attacks her \u2018stamina\u2019 at debate</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p><em><strong>Clinton</strong></em></p> <p>Eager to draw a contrast on national security, an issue high on Americans\u2019 priorities amid recent terrorist attacks, Clinton relied on familiar characterizations of Trump: he was unfit to be president, unqualified and lacking the right temperament, and he should not have access to the nuclear codes.</p> <p>For the benefit of voters tuning in to the race for the first time, Clinton enthusiastically highlighted Trump\u2019s admiration for the Russian president, Vladimir Putin \u2013 regarded by most members of Trump\u2019s Republican party as a dictator and a thug.

  "<h2>A NAILED-ON POST-5pm STATEMENT IF EVER THERE WAS ONE</h2> <p>There is a splendid second-hand anecdote in Joey Barton\u2019s autobiography, No Nonsense, that features a young Sam Allardyce, wearing a thong and basted to within an inch of his life with suntan lotion on a Spanish beach, being buried up to his neck for hours as a forfeit for losing a wrestling match with one of his Preston team-mates and becoming so hungry during his incarceration that he ate 14 fried eggs in one sitting afterwards. While The Fiver is prepared to doubt the veracity of this possibly apocryphal story on the grounds that we can\u2019t imagine how anyone covered in lotion could possibly be pinned into submission for a three-count, we couldn\u2019t help but wonder if Big Sam wasn\u2019t perhaps yearning for those days of puckish seaside abandon on the long drive to meet his bosses at FA HQ on Tuesday morning. It might be his head that he would now rather have buried in the sand.</p> <p>The story of Big Sam\u2019s \u201cbanter burial\u201d is not the most fascinating vignette in Barton\u2019s often bleak, boorish and disturbing tome, but one of those little details that remains logged forever in the brain due to its almost total absurdity. The Fiver has no idea how things will pan out for Big Sam <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/26/sam-allardyce-fa-newspaper-sting-england-manager\">in the wake of the Telegraph sting</a>, but we suspect those reports, with accompanying photos of him leaving home with \u201chis shirt unbuttoned to the navel\u201d, will feature prominently on our internal highlights reel any time we reflect on this cautionary tale.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/27/fa-sam-allardyce-england-manager-job\">Sam Allardyce fights to save England manager\u2019s job in FA crisis talks</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The story so far according to the Telegraph: in the company of his two most trusted advisors (whose own short-term futures must be fairly insecure considering the apparently dismal quality of their advice on this occasion) and some total strangers who happened to be undercover reporters, Big Sam was secretly filmed describing himself as \u201ca keynote speaker\u201d (no, really) and provisionally agreeing to provide \u00a3400,000 worth of advice to non-existent clients of a non-existent company with which he was completely unfamiliar. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/27/what-exactly-is-sam-allardyce-accused-of\">During the course of this conversation and a subsequent one</a>, he also belittled both his predecessor, his predecessor\u2019s assistant and his new employers, while demonstrating an ignorance of the finer points of knockout football that, on its own, should be enough to get him slung out of the England job. Contrary to what he told his new chums, a draw against Iceland wouldn\u2019t have got England through at Euro 2016, although we\u2019re prepared to concede he might know how to sidestep those pesky Fifa regulations that suggest otherwise.</p> <p>As things stand, various FA bigwigs are reported to be holding crisis talks, in a bid to discover if their most high-profile employee, who began shooting his mouth off before he\u2019d even taken a training session, has done anything dumb enough to merit dismissal. They must also attempt to elucidate what other unpleasantness is on its way down the pipe and establish if that was a pint of white wine or Budweiser Big Sam was drinking, before deciding which would be the more shocking to be seen drinking in public. Opinion among Fleet Street\u2019s finest is divided, with some saying Big Sam may get off with a warning for his foolishness on the grounds that he\u2019s guilty of little more than greed and stupidity. Others reckon he\u2019ll get his marching orders after just one game, from a panic-stricken FA hierarchy worried their carefully cultivated image as indecisive, dithering, out-of-touch buffoons might take a kicking. They can\u2019t say they weren\u2019t warned: a decade ago, a blustering and indignant Big Sam <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2006/sep/23/newsstory.sport1\">threatened the BBC with a writ</a> after reporters behind a different sting alleged he was receiving bungs from agents.

  "<p>Theresa May faced accusations from within government that she tried to remove evidence about the positive impact of immigration on the British economy from a critical report that was published before the EU referendum. </p> <p>Correspondence seen by the Guardian lays bare a six-month tussle between Conservative and Liberal Democrat advisers over the study, which was part of a government-wide exercise into the pros and cons of EU membership. </p> <p>Emails dating back to 2014 show Lib Dem advisers, who were then in government as part of the coalition, complaining repeatedly about May\u2019s interventions. </p> <p>They claimed internally that the then home secretary was determined to paint a negative picture of Britain\u2019s relationship with European countries when it came to immigration.The exchanges suggested that May wanted to claim that \u201cbenefits tourism\u201d was a serious problem, attracting immigrants into Britain.</p> <p>But the advisers said there was little evidence to support the assertion, suggesting instead that internal DWP figures might underline it as a \u201csmall-scale problem\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cMy impression is that Conservative secretaries of state are determined not to admit this,\u201d wrote one participant. Another said: \u201cThe home secretary is also deeply committed to the argument that free movement allows foreign criminals into the UK.\u201d</p> <p>The suggestion will be seized on by pro-EU campaigners who believe that May made it harder for David Cameron to argue for Britain\u2019s continued membership.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u201cA lot of the pro-free movement evidence has been removed,\u201d complained one adviser, citing a UCL report that said eastern European migrants were \u201c58% less likely to live in social housing\u201d and one showing migrants paid more in tax then they take in benefits.</p> <p>The emails report conversations among civil servants inside the Home Office and Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) saying that May had taken a particularly active interest in the study. </p> <p> </p> <p>Overall, the Lib Dems expressed frustration at an attempt to depict free movement as a \u201cone-way street\u201d, with foreign workers using the UK\u2019s NHS and claiming benefits, while downplaying the numbers of British people living and working on the continent. </p> <p>The emails have been seen after Cameron\u2019s former director of communications, Craig Oliver, accused May of repeatedly failing to throw her weight behind the campaign to keep Britain in the EU.</p> <p>The report from the Home Office, with contributions from Ian Duncan Smith\u2019s DWP, was one of the 32 Whitehall studies on the \u201dbalance of competences\u201d between the UK and the EU insisted on by the Conservatives in the 2010 Coalition Agreement.</p> <p>The immigration report was the most bitterly contested and Nick Clegg, the former Lib Dem leader, has since publicly accused May of tampering with the report to minimise the number of British people living abroad.<br></p> <p>But this set of emails goes further, suggesting the report was delayed because Lib Dems believed the home secretary\u2019s office refused to release revised versions. They argued that the government would be left picking up the tab for Brits abroad if their interests were completely ignored. </p> <p>Clegg\u2019s party also described as \u201ccompletely baseless\u201d the idea that benefits were the key factor in attracting workers in the UK, rather than shortages of skills in the UK labour market.</p> <p>Downing Street released the final report the day after parliament rose for the 2014 summer recess. </p> <p>Lord Wallace of Saltaire, the Lib Dem minister who led the negotiations on these reports, told a similar story to the correspondence. \u201cThere was a deep-seated reluctance from within the home secretary\u2019s office to admit that free movement brings benefits as well as costs to British citizens, or to allow us to cite evidence which weakened the Eurosceptic narrative,\u201d he told the Guardian.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>A source close to the prime minister accused the Lib Dems of trying \u201cto rig the balance of competences review\u201d and saying the country had since voted decisively to leave the EU. </p> <p>\u201cTheresa May has been completely consistent in her view that we need more control over our immigration system rather than less, and that levels of immigration are too high. Since becoming prime minister, she has made clear that following Brexit we will get the right deal to control the number of people who come to Britain from Europe,\u201d he said. </p>",
  "<p>A former headquarters of a property management company that rents empty buildings to tenants who act as guardians to prevent them from being squatted has itself been occupied by protesters.</p> <p>The upmarket building in Shoreditch, east London, was used by Camelot Europe and has been targeted by activists who say the property guardians are not getting a good deal and do not have full tenancy rights.</p> <p>The squatters say they simply entered the former Camelot building through an open door. The building is empty, but the Camelot logo is still displayed clearly on the front of it.<br></p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not what we would expect from Camelot, a company that prides itself on supplying property guardians to landlords of commercial and residential buildings to prevent them being squatted,\u201d said Frank Freeman, 29, one of the activists who has moved into the property.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fbc9ef71aed5791f93b3dd37f5384b2bbb0d0a88\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fbc9ef71aed5791f93b3dd37f5384b2bbb0d0a88/0_435_3834_2300/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A squatter inside Camelot Europe\u2019s former offices in Shoreditch, east London.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A squatter inside Camelot Europe\u2019s former offices in Shoreditch, east London.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Martin Godwin/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWe are doing this on behalf of dispossessed, homeless people and guardians who are being exploited,\u201d Freeman said. \u201cWe hope to run art workshops, yoga classes and exhibitions. London is built on culture, but artists and creative people can no longer afford to live here. It is becoming a sterile and unaffordable place.\u201d</p> <p>Property guardianship was once considered a good option for priced-out tenants, who were offered low-cost temporary homes in return for protecting empty buildings, but rents have been rising and concerns growing about the limited rights occupiers have.</p> <p>The Green party\u2019s Si\u00e2n Berry recently described the schemes as the \u201czero-hours contract of housing\u201d, because occupants can be evicted at short notice if they are deemed to have violated the licence agreement.</p> <p>The irony of targeting a property guardian business has not been lost on the squatters, who have adapted Camelot\u2019s castle logo, inserted the squatters\u2019 sign and renamed the premises Camesquat.</p> <p>Literature from the estate agents Currell, whose marketing materials the squatters found when they moved into the building, shows that it has been marketed for sale for \u00a33.1m, exclusive of VAT. The activists have cracked jokes about the irony of Camelot\u2019s failure to protect its own building from squatters, but they say their occupation has a serious purpose.</p> <p>Dr Sarah Keenan, a lecturer in law at Birkbeck, University of London, said: \u201cThe rights of tenants and licensees are generally very weak in England and Wales. In January this year the government voted against a proposed amendment to the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/society/housing\">housing</a> and planning bill, which was designed to ensure properties are fit for human habitation. Because guardians are licensees rather than tenants, they can be easily evicted and they don\u2019t have the right to have their deposits protected.\u201d</p> <p>Complaints by current and former property guardians for Camelot in a number of different buildings in the London area include allegations over failure to repair fire alarms, asbestos removal work carried out while they were in the property, and recently an accident involving a man, Mace Richards, who was looking after a property in Walton-on-Thames. On 22 August, a glass panel broke on his hands causing severe injury. He had to have reconstructive surgery at St George\u2019s hospital.</p> <p>\u201cI was in absolute agony,\u201d said Richards. \u201cI work as an actor and a hand model \u2013 my hands appeared in the opening of a Jimmy McGovern series called Banished \u2013 but I can\u2019t get any work at the moment because of the damage to my hands. I hope that I will recover enough to be able to work again, but I have lots of scarring on my hands and I have been evicted by Camelot after I asked for their insurance details so I could make a personal injury claim about my hands.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"419a8fbc0cf49b7abea9fbd65dafd2a05933502e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/419a8fbc0cf49b7abea9fbd65dafd2a05933502e/70_257_4113_2468/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Squatters pose in the former offices of Camelot Europe.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Squatters pose in the former offices of Camelot Europe.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Martin Godwin/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On Monday night, security guards appeared at the door of the premises barring entry to a group of squatters who had congregated on the pavement to support those inside occupying the building.</p> <p>Police were called and a dispersal order was put in place between 3am and noon on Tuesday requiring both the Camelot security officials and the squatters to move away from the front of the former Camelot building.</p> <p>After the order was lifted squatters reported that the security team returned and were joined by squatters and the standoff between the two groups resumed.</p> <p>Paul Ridge, of Bindmans Solicitors, who is advising the squatters, said: \u201cAt midnight last night I spoke to the police about the \u2018self help\u2019 approach being used by Camelot\u2019s security people. I advised the police that the legal process needs to take its course with this occupation.\u201d <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Mike Goldsmith, chief operating officer of Camelot Europe, said: \u201cCamelot are not planning to evict the squatters. We have security staff outside the building (no member of staff or security company have entered or attempted to enter the building) to prevent further squatters from accessing the building illegally.\u201d</p> <p>Commenting on the specific allegations made by the squatters, Goldsmith said: \u201cMr Richards was told by the property manager that his licence was being terminated because of his injury. The manager wrongly assumed this, as Mr Richards received his injury in an area of the building which was clearly marked out of bounds.</p> <p>\u201cWhen this was brought to my attention, Mr Richards was informed that his claim would be forwarded to Camelot\u2019s insurer [and was done a number of weeks ago]. The claim will still be processed irrespective of Mr Richards\u2019 status with Camelot. Mr Richards is having his licence revoked because he was in a clearly signed out of bounds area and because he has stated that he can\u2019t pay his licence fee going forward. As a gesture of good faith we have already written off \u00a31,500 of his debt.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/society/squatting\">Squatting</a> residential buildings is now a criminal offence, but squatting commercial buildings remains a civil offence. In order to remove squatters from a property such as Camelot\u2019s in Shoreditch, an eviction notice would have to be sought from the county court.</p> <p> </p>",

Though dwarfed by an estimated television audience of up to 100 million people, they included well-known political figures including former presidential candidate Jesse Jackson, casino mogul Sheldon Adelson and New York City mayor Bill de Blasio as well as celebrities such as billionaire Mark Cuban and controversial boxing promoter Don King. </p> <p>At first Trump appeared to be trying to rein in his more aggressive tendency. \u201cIs that OK? I want you to be happy. It\u2019s very important to me,\u201d he said to Clinton, using her title, Secretary Clinton. </p> <p>But Trump, who was sniffing and sounded nasally congested, quickly grew agitated, repeatedly interrupting Clinton and often shouting over her as she attempted to respond to questions. </p> <p>In particular, he aggressively went after her record on trade \u2013 interjecting as Clinton spoke, by pointing to her husband Bill Clinton\u2019s signing of Nafta in the 1990s. </p> <p>Clinton immediately jabbed at Trump, making reference to the $14m that the Republican nominee got in a series of loans from his father, Fred, to start his business empire. The older Trump, a successful real estate developer, helped to fund his son\u2019s effort to remodel the Grand Hyatt hotel in midtown Manhattan and also aided his son with his political connections. Trump immediately fired back, insisting that \u201cit was only a small loan\u201d from his father, taking the bait offered by his Democratic rival.</p> <p>Trump then knocked Clinton for previously supporting the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the landmark 12-nation trade pact brokered under the Obama administration. When Clinton sought to clarify that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/oct/07/hillary-clinton-opposes-trans-pacific-partnership-tpp\">she no longer backed the agreement</a>, Trump intervened again and began drowning her out with shouts of: \u201cIs it President Obama\u2019s fault?

Trump was especially challenging to control, as he launched frequently into tirades that did not necessarily address the question asked.</p> <p>The two candidates entered into a fiery exchange about Trump\u2019s taxes as the Republican nominee pledged to release his tax returns provided that Clinton released the 33,000 emails that were deleted from her private home server. Clinton fired back and proceeded to lay out all the hypothetical reasons that Trump, who has claimed he is under a tax inspector\u2019s audit, was not releasing his tax returns. Clinton said perhaps Trump was \u201cnot as rich as he says he is, not as charitable as he says he is\u201d and even suggested that Trump hadn\u2019t paid any income tax for several years. The Republican nominee responded \u201cthat makes me smart\u201d and Clinton continued to admonish him by suggesting: \u201cI think he is probably not all that enthusiastic about having the rest of the country see because it must be something really important, even terrible that he is trying to hide.\u201d </p> <p>Afterwards, Jason Miller, Trump\u2019s senior communications adviser, avoided repeated questions from reporters about whether the Republican nominee has paid federal income taxes.

Central to Malawi\u2019s mining industry is Karonga district, which borders Tanzania and is located on the north-western shores of Lake Malawi. The nation\u2019s first uranium mine opened here in 2009, and the district now houses two of the four largest coal mines in Malawi as well, the report claims.</p> <p>The government has said that the private investment brought by mining \u2013 from both local and international companies, including those from Australia and Cyprus \u2013 would in turn create jobs for Malawians and improve locals\u2019 access to infrastructure.

The report said that officials at the Ministry of Natural Resources, Energy and Mining acknowledged that health centres are urgently needed in mining communities, but admitted that the government had not yet managed to promote enforcement of company commitments to build them.</p> <p>Jan Egil Moe, a spokesman for Independent Oil Resources, of which Eland is a subsidiary, said that Eland has not been operational in Malawi for two years. Asked about the local communities\u2019 allegations, he said: \u201cThere have been a lot of allegations from the villagers. We do not comment on the allegations. During the operations, the mine was a good citizen and paid generous compensation to the villagers \u2026 We followed all the rules and regulations from the government.\u201d </p> <p>In an email to the Guardian, Paladin\u2019s CEO, Alexander Molyneux, refuted claims that villagers had been forcibly evicted and stressed that Paladin have invested in social improvement projects in the area. \u201cWe solely funded the water purification plant, which is the main source of clean drinking water for Karonga district. We built a clinic in Kayelekera, roads, and school houses. [We] provided direct support to the community in the form of donations of food, non-mining vocational training and school supplies,\u201d Molyneux said.<br></p> <p>Malcoal director Hastings Jere described the allegations as \u201cbaseless and unfounded\u201d. </p> <p>\u201cI was one of the people that surveyed the area [for the mine\u2019s operations] in 2005,\u201d he said. \u201cAt that time there was not even a single village within the EPL [exclusive prospecting licence]. When the mine opened in 2006, people from all over the district flocked to the mine as jobseekers and erected shacks within the mine area. We tried to move them without success. No single village was relocated and no compensation issue has ever been discussed \u2026 Malcoal has never refused to test the water \u2026 With due respect, the stories are totally false.\u201d</p> <p>Reinford Mwangonde, executive director of Citizens for Justice, which hosts the Secretariat of the <a href=\"http://www.nrjnmalawi.mw/\">Natural Resources Justice Network</a>, a Malawian network of non-governmental organisations pressing for sustainable resource extraction, said: \u201cThe push for industrialisation and growth needs to be accompanied by a social licence and companies should deliver on their promises.\u201d</p> <p>Rall added: \u201cThe Karonga district mines are just the first in many extractive projects in Malawi, making the lessons they have to offer extremely important.

  "<p>There are days when I imagine myself as a smallholder. In my mind, I own a farm with old, stone walls and a red tiled roof. Around my perfect little farm the countryside rolls away in hues of amber and green. Near the house there\u2019s a walled vegetable garden with rich, weed-free soil. In this perfect dream it is always summer \u2013 the days are long and lush and last forever. Just thinking of it now makes me let out a wistful sigh.<br></p> <p>But I know that there\u2019s one glaring problem with this mental picture: I\u2019m delusional.</p> <p>I blame John Steinbeck for my delusions. This is because there\u2019s a good chance that the seeds of this idyllic rural life were sown in my mind by the novel <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Of_Mice_and_Men\">Of Mice and Men</a>. Most of us have read about the two ranch hands, George Milton and Lennie Small, in secondary school. Steinbeck\u2019s novel captivated me then and still captivates me now. In the book, the two men want nothing more than to own their own farm and to \u201clive off the fatta the lan\u2019\u201d. Long before <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Seymour_(author)\">John Seymour</a> baited the general public with the Shangri-La of self-sufficiency, George and Lennie were wandering around the fields of California looking for a place to call their own. For a long time, I\u2019ve been wandering with them.</p> <p>Before anyone jumps to the obvious joke, yes I am probably more like Lennie then George. However, I am smart enough at least to know this: gardening is not farming. The quest for a visually appealing space has little to do with the need to produce food. The utilitarian needs of farmers are a long way away from the aesthetic desires of gardeners. Therefore I do what most gardeners do \u2013 I have a vegetable patch where I can grow a few things while safely relying on those who actually know what they\u2019re doing; the farmers.</p> <p>This spring however, my inner Lennie got the better of me. I bought chickens. My purchase wasn\u2019t just on a whim; I had a space at the end of my garden; I researched the cost and equipment necessary to keep three chickens; I learned about their needs and requirements and how to keep them healthy. Still, I felt apprehensive when we drove to a local farm and arrived back home with our three new hens. I wondered if I\u2019d made the right decision.</p> <p>The first night I introduced the hens to their new home, I was nervous. We have foxes in our neighbourhood, and I was worried that they\u2019d swarm on the coop in some kind of feeding frenzy the moment they smelt the birds. That first night I tiptoed, slippers wet from the lawn, several times back and forth to the henhouse to make sure the girls were okay. The next morning, when all three chickens emerged from their house alive, I was relieved. To top it all off, later that morning we had our first egg. My daughter was ecstatic. We took a picture (yes, of an egg). I felt as if my dream of owning a farm was just that little bit closer.</p> <p>That first week my wife joked that we should name the smallest chicken, who is all brown, Nugget. I laughed and suggested that the other two might be called Kiev and Tonight. As the days passed, and no new names were put forward, the joke stuck. We now have three chickens who go by the names of Tonight, Kiev, and Nugget. Luckily, my daughter is too young to understand the implications.</p> <p>So, what have I learned from my little smallholding? </p> <ol> <li>Chickens like to peck each other. It\u2019s called feather pecking and it often a sign of boredom. I\u2019ve tried putting treats and toys inside the run for entertainment; it didn\u2019t work. One of my hens ended up with a completely featherless backside. My only choice was to isolate the offending chicken, which meant extending the run.</li> <li>Anti-peck sprays don\u2019t work. I sprayed and, while it made my hands and shoes stink, it did little to stop the pecking.</li> <li>Fresh eggs taste amazing.</li> <li>Don\u2019t let a chicken near newly sown vegetables. I turned my back one day for the briefest of moments, and my hens had completely mown down a bed of newly sprouted cabbages.</li> <li>Kids love chickens. My daughter loves to run out and collect the eggs at the end of the day and my son is fascinated by them.</li> <li>If you don\u2019t clean out the coop at least once a week the smell becomes really unpleasant. I missed a week and the smell was pungent. In a small garden this could be a problem.</li> <li>Chickens are fast. The first time I let them out I had no idea how to get them back in the run. I succeeded in herding them into the run using, among other things, a hose, a bean pole, some netting, and a bed sheet. It took about an hour.</li> <li>At the end of a long day it is really satisfying to watch the hens peck about on the grass. They are curious animals and are quite funny.</li> <li>They can scratch. If you look at a hens feet you are reminded that they\u2019re related to dinosaurs. Don\u2019t let them get their claws into you.</li> <li>They love slugs and are good at cleaning the soil. If you don\u2019t mind your herbaceous perennials getting knocked around a bit, hens are a good organic solution to pest control.</li> </ol> <p>After a summer with three chickens I suppose the obvious question is this: am I glad I did it? Am I glad I indulged my desire for a piece of country living? The answer is yes. I like strolling out in morning and letting the hens out and it\u2019s still fun to go and collect the eggs for cooking. And yes, I like watching the hens wander around the garden.

That\u2019s what Navaz Batliwala outlines in her book, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/New-Garconne-How-Modern-Gentlewoman/dp/1780678584\">The New Gar\u00e7onne: How to be a Modern Gentlewoman</a>, which explores the codes of being a modern day gar\u00e7onne<em> </em>or gar\u00e7on manqu\u00e9 (tomboy).<em tabindex=\"-1\"> </em>Inspired by 1920s Gallic flapper girls and their short hair and drop-waist dresses, this French reappropriation of menswear moves away from a heteronormative division of roles.</p> <p>The book arguably coincides with a deep revival of the trend in the country and the concept of old Parisian sexiness is being challenged by a new style, one which is less feminine and less gender-dependent, and which is taking over for several different reasons. \u201cThe standardised, sexy Parisienne has always served an important function for the country \u2013 it is a commodity that luxury brands want to associate themselves with, a part of the French landscape,\u201d said Julie Levoyer, a high-end beauty consultant. If fashion is sometimes a mirror of a broader social context, it\u2019s hard not to see a connection to the rise of conservative policies across the country, including recent violent sexist backlash over the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/24/the-guardian-view-on-frances-burkini-bans-ugly-politics-on-the-beach\">Burkini issue</a> following a ban requested by right-wing municipalities (since overruled by the government). \u201cPart of women\u2019s liberation will be breaking out of that stereotype\u201d says Levoyer. At a time where some <em tabindex=\"-1\">Fran\u00e7aises</em> are forbidden to cover up, the Gar\u00e7onne supports the view that all women should have to right to free themselves from objectifying male gazes.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e447d05040442f9a30a82c9f2ce99ccf08125ef0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e447d05040442f9a30a82c9f2ce99ccf08125ef0/0_0_3210_4816/667.jpg\" alt=\"Marie Marot in Paris last summer.\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Marie Marot in Paris last summer.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rindoff Petroff/Hekimian/Getty Images for Federation Francaise de la Couture</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It also chimes with what is happening on the political landscape. As the presidential race is accelerating and Sarkozy is making a comeback, France\u2019s Gentlewomen, both stylish and engaging, are making headlines. Marie Marot, a French designer known for her androgynous clothing, model Clara 3000, who recently featured on the cover of i-D magazine and Maud Escudie, muse and model to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/vetements\">Vetements</a>\u2019 Demna Gvasalia, all share a deliberately non-sexualised appearance, downplaying their adherence to highly-binarised Parisian fashion. Marot thinks tomboy fashion provides a new space for self-expression: \u201cThe mistake people make is to think of [androgyny] as an imitation of masculinity. It\u2019s precisely the opposite: it is about redefining a sense of elegance and seduction that you are in control of.\u201d<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BKh-Ic-BQG6/?taken-by=maudescudie\" data-alt=\"Maud Escudie in Reedition magazine.\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;instagram-media&quot; data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-version=&quot;7&quot; style=&quot; background:#FFF; border:0; border-radius:3px; box-shadow:0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width:658px; padding:0; width:99.375%; width:-webkit-calc(100% - 2px); width:calc(100% - 2px);&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;padding:8px;&quot;&gt; &lt;div style=&quot; background:#F8F8F8; line-height:0; margin-top:40px; padding:54.525862069% 0; text-align:center; width:100%;&quot;&gt; &lt;div style=&quot; background:url(data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAACwAAAAsCAMAAAApWqozAAAABGdBTUEAALGPC/xhBQAAAAFzUkdCAK7OHOkAAAAMUExURczMzPf399fX1+bm5mzY9AMAAADiSURBVDjLvZXbEsMgCES5/P8/t9FuRVCRmU73JWlzosgSIIZURCjo/ad+EQJJB4Hv8BFt+IDpQoCx1wjOSBFhh2XssxEIYn3ulI/6MNReE07UIWJEv8UEOWDS88LY97kqyTliJKKtuYBbruAyVh5wOHiXmpi5we58Ek028czwyuQdLKPG1Bkb4NnM+VeAnfHqn1k4+GPT6uGQcvu2h2OVuIf/gWUFyy8OWEpdyZSa3aVCqpVoVvzZZ2VTnn2wU8qzVjDDetO90GSy9mVLqtgYSy231MxrY6I2gGqjrTY0L8fxCxfCBbhWrsYYAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC); display:block; height:44px; margin:0 auto -44px; position:relative; top:-22px; width:44px;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p style=&quot; margin:8px 0 0 0; padding:0 4px;&quot;&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/BKh-Ic-BQG6/&quot; style=&quot; color:#000; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px; text-decoration:none; word-wrap:break-word;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;#morning my last shoot for @reeditionmag w/ @tomordoyno &amp;amp; @jobarker10 #balenciaga shoes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style=&quot; color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;&quot;&gt;A photo posted by Maud ESCUDIE (@maudescudie) on &lt;time style=&quot; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;&quot; datetime=&quot;2016-09-19T08:28:03+00:00&quot;&gt;Sep 19, 2016 at 1:28am PDT&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;script async defer src=&quot;//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> <figcaption>Maud Escudie in Reedition magazine.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Female polticians have also become accidental doyennes of the trend.

  "<p>British political attitudes to compulsory minimum wages have undergone an astounding transformation. A generation ago, any sort of minimum was viewed with suspicion not just by free-market economists, but also by many in the labour movement. The former argued that unaffordable wages would cost jobs. The latter knew that negotiation through collective bargaining had a better track record in improving pay for groups of workers than relying on public bodies to set minimum rates. Some trade unionists also feared a narrowing of differentials in a \u201clevelling down\u201d.</p> <p>But by 1999, when the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Minimum_Wage_Act_1998\" title=\"\">national minimum wage</a> (NMW) was introduced by the Labour government, the decline of unions and collective bargaining made this a valuable win. The Tories still <a href=\"http://www.politics.co.uk/reference/national-minimum-wage\" title=\"\">vigorously opposed it</a>, and arguments that it would cost jobs caused it to be set at a ridiculously cautious, low level, policed for any sign of economic unsoundness by the Low Pay Commission.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/26/john-mcdonnell-10-an-hour-living-wage-plan-labour-conference\">John McDonnell announces \u00a310 an hour living wage plan</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Seventeen years on, and politicians are involved in an unexpected bidding war. First, Ed Miliband\u2019s Labour party started to make a big increase in the NMW, to \u00a38 by 2020, a key plank of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/apr/13/labour-manifesto-pledges-to-boost-minimum-wage-and-cut-deficit\" title=\"\">2015 election manifesto</a>. A few months later, George Osborne stole Labour\u2019s clothes by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/reality-check/2015/jul/08/george-osborne-budget-national-living-wage\" title=\"\">promising \u00a39</a> and calling it the national living wage, even though it was not calculated in relation to living costs like the real, accredited voluntary living wage. Now Labour\u2019s shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, is trying to steal them back by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/26/john-mcdonnell-10-an-hour-living-wage-plan-labour-conference\" title=\"\">promising a compulsory \u201creal living wage\u201d</a> of at least \u00a310, again by 2020.</p> <p>So what is going on? One reason is that these wages promises seem so attractive to politicians in a time of austerity is that they can make people better off without obviously requiring extra public money (although how to fund additional taxpayer costs when care workers are paid properly remains an unanswered question). Crucially, the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/low-pay-commission\" title=\"\">Low Pay Commission</a> has <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-minimum-wage-low-pay-commission-report-spring-2016\" title=\"\">found that</a> so far, raising the minimum wage has not cost jobs as the economists predicted. There\u2019s a wealth of evidence from the US to confirm this.</p> <p>But hang on just a second. Just because cautiously set minimum wages have been affordable so far, this doesn\u2019t mean there\u2019s scope for unlimited increases without some negative impacts.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.livingwage.org.uk/calculation\" title=\"\">calculation of a living wage</a>, based on <a href=\"http://www.lboro.ac.uk/research/crsp/mis/\" title=\"\">our research at Loughborough</a>, helps both to put the national minimum in context and to show employers who can afford it what is an adequate benchmark. But making such a minimum compulsory, with no reference to the Low Pay Commission\u2019s assessment of labour market impacts, could be seriously risky.</p> <p>Imagine that a government went doggedly ahead with such a policy, drawing on moral arguments and ignoring any economic evidence. At some point, major layoffs by businesses citing excessive wage costs may ensue. Eventually, the link with living wages would then be modified or abandoned by the government, and the reputational damage to setting wage floors would affect such policies for years to come.</p> <p>It may seem slightly perverse that I am therefore cautioning against recklessly imposing a standard that is the product of my own research about what people need to live on. But I would argue that there are two ways in which you can start to integrate the concepts of minimum wage and living wage that are not reckless.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/27/low-paid-workers-sports-direct-university-staff-rights-mike-ashley\">Think only low\u2013paid workers get the Sports Direct treatment? You\u2019re wrong | Aditya Chakrabortty</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The first is to integrate the aim of moving to a \u201creal living wage\u201d into policy, while retaining an emergency brake if job losses do result. This would involve retaining the Low Pay Commission and its focus on labour market effects of the NMW, but requiring it to move in steps towards the living wage unless clear evidence of harm was emerging.</p> <p>The second way this could all be made more feasible is by committing to set policies for living wages and tax credits in a joined-up way. The living wage is set to be enough to cover minimum living costs once any top-ups such as tax credits are taken into account. In a scenario where a living wages becomes too high for the market to bear, more generous family benefits of this kind would help bring its level down. This involves working out a fair division between the state and employers in assuring family living standards.</p> <p>McDonnell is therefore right that we can think of the role of the state in supporting living standards in a new way. The important point in doing so is to devise a sustainable strategy of combining wages with other incomes to ensure that workers have a decent living, and to be cautious of rash promises that will be hard to keep.</p>",
  "<p>There was a time when the very sight of Peter Robinson in public could cause uproar. \u201cI used to walk along Oxford Street on the way to the Embassy Club on an afternoon, because they used to do a cocktail thing there at four o\u2019clock,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019d have on an Anthony Price dress, fox fur, diamantes, the hair, the five-inch stilettos, fishnets, all of that. And the whole of fucking Oxford Street \u2026 cars would stop, people would crash into each other, guys would lean out of windows going, \u2018All right, darlin!\u2019\u201d, builders on building sites would go fucking nuts and drop things, that kind of vibe. People didn\u2019t look like me then; they just didn\u2019t. <em>Women</em> didn\u2019t look like that, let alone a man, a boy dressed up like that. People went fucking nuts.\u201d</p> <p>That was the best part of 40 years ago, when Robinson had already changed his name to Marilyn \u2013 turning a homophobic insult from his troubled youth into what would these days be called his brand \u2013 but some time before his brief brush with pop fame. If he doesn\u2019t provoke quite such a stir today, he\u2019s still adept at making a striking entrance. I\u2019m sitting with my back to the door when he walks into the north London restaurant where the interview is taking place. He introduces himself by walking up behind me, covering my eyes and shouting: \u201cGuess who?\u201d (I\u2019ve never met him before.)</p> <p>He is wearing a torn tartan shirt, a clashing tartan kilt, boots, a bit of makeup around the eyes but \u201cno underwear\u201d, as he cheerfully informs me. He looks, it has to be said, fantastic: better than anyone who spent most of the last two decades secreted away taking heroin and crack has any right to; even someone who, by their own account, was \u201cbloody gorgeous\u201d to start off with.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5130edf8a64f2397c50e843509358e052a83329d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5130edf8a64f2397c50e843509358e052a83329d/0_28_2826_1695/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Boy George and Marilyn out clubbing in London in 1982.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Boy George and Marilyn out clubbing in London in 1982.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dave Hogan/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He last had a hit single in 1984, the same year he appeared on Band Aid\u2019s Do They Know It\u2019s Christmas? \u2013 you can see him in a yellow top pouting away between Bananarama and the drummer from Duran Duran in the famous photo, but he doesn\u2019t exactly give off the aura of someone tentatively re-entering public life after decades of obscurity, addiction and penury. He has a new single out, and an album forthcoming, both produced by his old friend and sparring partner Boy George. \u201cNervous?\u201d he frowns incredulously: you\u2019d think I\u2019d just asked him if he could levitate or perform neurosurgery. \u201cNah. I can sing. I can perform. I can stand in front of a band. And I want to let people know that it doesn\u2019t matter what happens, if you decide to change it, it\u2019s changeable.\u201d</p> <p>He is, by his own account, a tough cookie: \u201cI\u2019ve been trained for personal abuse since I was a young boy, so it\u2019s kind of like water off a duck\u2019s back.\u201d The abuse started when he and his mother arrived in England from Jamaica, where he was born: his father had been working there as a yacht salesman, but his parents\u2019 marriage broke up when he was five. He moved from school to school in Hertfordshire and was relentlessly bullied: on one occasion, he claims, people started shouting \u201cpoof\u201d and \u201cqueer\u201d at him before he\u2019d even reached the classroom on his first day \u2013 he hadn\u2019t even opened his mouth. \u201cI just think I was different. I\u2019d lived in Jamaica until I was five and I think the rhythms of life there had kind of seeped into me, subconsciously. I was a different species, a different breed.\u201d</p> <p>By 15, he\u2019d abandoned school altogether, lured by London\u2019s nightlife. He started wearing makeup and visiting the Sombrero, the celebrated gay club on Kensington High Street, in west London, where he found himself feted rather than mocked. \u201cIt was full of freaks. Rent boys and drag queens and old rich guys that wanted to pick up little young pretty boys. It was like a melange of oddness, so I liked that.\u201d</p> <p>By the time he discovered Billy\u2019s and the Blitz, the groundbreaking clubs run by Steve Strange that gave birth to the new romantic movement, he\u2019d transformed himself into Marilyn, with his mother\u2019s inadvertent help. \u201cMy mum was stunningly beautiful, and she still had all her old clothes. I was going through her wardrobe, trying to get her to wear them: these pencil skirts and stilettos and low-cut dresses: \u2018Mum, put your red dress on, you\u2019re beautiful, you\u2019re still young.\u2019 But she\u2019d be in a cardigan: \u2018I\u2019m not wearing that stuff to go to the bingo.\u2019 So I was sort of doing it on behalf of my mum because she wouldn\u2019t, and then it evolved into getting back at my dad, because I always felt he\u2019d left me and I couldn\u2019t understand why. I used to make up stories that he\u2019d died in a fire when people asked about him. So I\u2019d dress up and all these straight guys would want to fuck me. I\u2019d let them think they could, let them buy me drinks all night, and then when they said: \u2018We\u2019re going home now.\u2019 I\u2019d go: \u2018Me and you? Go home? How did you work that out? Have you seen me? Now, look at you. I\u2019m not going home with you.\u2019 It wasn\u2019t really about them; it was about paying back my dad for leaving us.\u201d</p> <p>You can see why he attracted attention. In photos from the time, Marilyn looks extraordinary, even by the standards of the Blitz or the Embassy, a hedonistic gay disco that was \u201ckind of like what the Blitz wanted to be but wasn\u2019t\u201d. He quickly achieved a kind of fame \u2013 being photographed by the burgeoning new style press that centred around iD and the Face \u2013 without really knowing what he wanted to be famous for. There was some vague talk of a cabaret act with his new pal, Boy George \u2013 their friendship flourished despite a deeply unpromising first meeting, at which George informed him that he looked less like Marilyn Monroe than he did a pig \u2013 and an offer to make music, which he turned down in favour of visiting America with his then boyfriend. \u201cUm, no,\u201d he concedes, when I ask him if he was driven to become a singer. \u201cI just wanted to be wonderful. That was it. Very naive, but that\u2019s the way it was.\u201d</p> <p>With his minor-but-blossoming celebrity came a certain notoriety. At one point, he says, he was banned from virtually every gay club in London. \u201cWe\u2019d get in the car on a Saturday night and try to decide where we were going, and everywhere someone suggested, it was, \u2018No, we can\u2019t go there because Marilyn can\u2019t get in.\u2019 I never felt like the gay scene was my tribe, because they didn\u2019t fucking accept me. It was like, \u2018We hate you, you\u2019re not coming our club, you look too good and you haven\u2019t got a checked shirt and a moustache.\u2019 I was even banned from the Black Cap, and that was a fucking drag club. You know, are you taking the piss? There was never any reason, it was just: \u2018You\u2019re banned.\u2019 I can only put it down to \u2026 jealousy, it\u2019s got to be.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s hard to escape the feeling that it might have had something to do with the fact that Marilyn was, by his own admission, \u201cvile\u201d. Indeed, his reputation for withering bitchiness \u2013 \u201can absolute monster\u201d, as Boy George once put it, \u201cwho would say all the things you never dared say\u201d \u2013 is a bit hard to square with the man sitting across the table. He is about as delightful a lunch companion as you could wish for: funny and charismatic and self-aware.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3772e1506c9190a0bb2b7e4253aa2c69001e0f7f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3772e1506c9190a0bb2b7e4253aa2c69001e0f7f/94_0_3357_2014/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Marylin (yellow top) in the famous Band Aid photograph.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Marylin (yellow top) in the famous Band Aid photograph.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC / REDFERNS</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cOh, I was just \u2026 horrific,\u201d he laughs. \u201cUnbelievable. People would come up to me and go: \u2018\u2019Scuse me, can I just tell you, you look amazing?\u2019 And I\u2019d go: \u2018Yes, I know, now fuck off.\u2019 The clothes, the Marilyn thing, it was like a suit of armour, I would never drrrrr-eam of being like that ordinarily. Plus there was the whole getting back at Dad, doing it for Mum sub-plot, but the poor unfortunate who came into contact with this maelstrom of childhood tics and quirks would really get the treatment. I still get people saying to me, \u2018I met you in 1979, do you remember when you said \u2026\u2019 And I think: oh God, what\u2019s coming now? What did I do?\u201d</p> <p>He did some modelling, appeared in the video for Eurythmics\u2019 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5iDKWV6Chg\">Who\u2019s That Girl?</a> and eventually signed a record deal in 1983, by which time Boy George was the biggest pop star in the country. He had one hit, a great bit of ersatz Motown bubblegum called <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMw_iosf5QI\">Calling Your Name</a>, and a gospel-ish followup called <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uRu83GNEk8\">Cry and Be Free</a>, but apparently things went wrong from the start. \u201cThe record company wanted me to be the beautiful new Boy George. It was like, first off, the old one\u2019s still alive, not exactly ugly, and doing quite well. And on top of that, it\u2019s actually my best friend and you\u2019re trying to play us off against each other. And my whole thing was different to George\u2019s anyway. George was cute and cuddly, and grannies liked him and said he preferred a cup of tea to sex. Whereas, I was kind of like: \u2018No, what is that? Is it a man? A woman? I dunno, but whatever it is, I wanna fuck it.\u2019\u201d He laughs. \u201cAt least that\u2019s my interpretation.\u201d</p> <p>Whatever the reason, his pop stardom was fleeting. He made attempts to keep it going \u2013 heading to America, working with big-name producers such as Don Was, being photographed with Madonna and Diana Ross \u2013 but nothing quite worked. A few months after the Band Aid single, he appeared in Smash Hits. He was supposed to be launching a new single with an appearance at a star-filled nightclub in New York. Instead, there were technical problems, he fled the stage without singing a note, and in the accompanying interview, sounded remarkably like a man in the throes of some kind of breakdown. He protested that he was \u201conly famous for being someone\u2019s friend\u201d, talked about killing himself, announced he\u2019d lost all his money as a result of bad business deals and alluded to drug use. \u201cOh, everything went tits-up, I basically think I did have a nervous breakdown and instead of dealing with it in a healthy way, I just decided to get high all the time, which really put the cat among the pigeons. But at least I was keeping it real,\u201d he smiles. \u201cIn Smash Hits.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"d1ef7a3be8644031ff8e9ecae4da4b200fe465b0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d1ef7a3be8644031ff8e9ecae4da4b200fe465b0/100_319_2185_2730/800.jpg\" alt=\"Marilyn  in 1984.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Marilyn in 1984.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The following year, at the height of the tabloid frenzy around Boy George\u2019s drug use, he was arrested for heroin possession, although the charge was later dismissed. He broke up with his boyfriend \u2013 a young Gavin Rossdale \u2013 which he now says was \u201cthe final straw\u201d: \u201cI just thought, \u2018Fuck off, leave me alone, I\u2019m not doing anything.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>He retreated to his mother\u2019s house in Hertfordshire and stayed there for 20 years, \u201cwithout going out, unless it was to the hospital or a dealer, or a doctor. But in general I just sat in a room for 20 years. I didn\u2019t want contact with people. The phone would ring and I just wouldn\u2019t pick it up. The curtains were always drawn, I didn\u2019t know whether it was night or day.\u201d</p> <p>What did he do all day? \u201cYou know the Alien movies? I had the box set of that. I had my laptop and my drug paraphernalia was all set up around me. And I\u2019d watch the first Alien film, then the second, then the third, fourth, fifth. And when it got to the end of the fifth one, I\u2019d put the first one back on again. So that was it. Over and over again. It was, like, my life has gone out of control, but I can control this, this tiny little bubble of behaviour: that was my safety, sitting in front of this computer screen with what I\u2019m watching, and I know all the dialogue and I know what\u2019s going to happen. I could control how I felt. \u2018Oh, I\u2019m bit tired, let me have some crack. Oh, I\u2019m a bit depressed, let\u2019s have some heroin. I need to go to sleep, I\u2019ll take a downer.\u2019 I just wanted to die, but I couldn\u2019t do that, I think because I was brought up a Catholic, with that idea that if you kill yourself you go to purgatory. I kept thinking, \u2018Well, it\u2019ll be just my fucking luck, I\u2019ll kill myself and wake up in exactly the situation I\u2019m trying to get away from and it\u2019ll be for eternity.\u2019 At least I know this is going to end at some point.\u201d</p> <p>How did his mum cope? \u201cIt was hideous.

The interviewers called up people they had already identified who said they planned on watching the debate. The survey started out with this question:</p> <p><em><strong>\u201cRegardless of which candidate you happen to support, who do you think did the best job in the debate \u2013 Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump?\u201d</strong></em></p> <p>At 62%, it was a clear win for Clinton, while just 27% said Trump (6% said \u201cboth equally\u201d and 4% said \u201cneither\u201d candidate won the debate). The other polling questions seemed to confirm a clear victory:</p> <p><strong><em>Who seemed to be the stronger leader?</em> <br></strong>Clinton 56% <br>Trump 39%</p> <p><em><strong>Who was more sincere and authentic?</strong></em> (Note: this has been a <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2015/09/21/hillary-clintons-inauthentic-self/?utm_term=.cd45f8aba61c\">problem</a> for Clinton in the past.)<br>Clinton 53% <br>Trump 40% </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2016/sep/27/donald-trump-hillary-clinton-debate-reaction-live\">Donald Trump blames debate 'sniffles' on bad microphone \u2013\u00a0campaign live</a> </p> </aside>  <p><em><strong>Overall, did the debate make you more likely to vote for a candidate?</strong></em><br>Clinton 34% <br>Trump 18%</p> <p>It all sounds like bad news for Republicans right? Maybe not. The poll was conducted among 521 people \u2013 even though those people were all registered voters, that\u2019s still not very many views you\u2019re collecting. </p> <p>There\u2019s another thing too \u2013 the entire poll was skewed towards Clinton to start off with. Of the people CNN/ORC spoke to, 41% identified themselves as Democrats and 26% identified as Republican (the rest said they were Independents). So you would have expected Clinton to do better, regardless of how she performed during the debate. </p> <p>If you\u2019re feeling particularly skeptical, you should pay attention to \u201cthe margin of error\u201d on a poll. On this one, it was +/- 4.5 percentage points which means that Clinton\u2019s lead could be much larger (take that last question above \u2013 the true national number could be as high as 38.5% choosing Clinton) or it could be much smaller (maybe only 29.5% did). When you take into account the fact that there were a lot of Democrats in this survey, that lead suddenly looks a lot less impressive. </p> <p>One last thing \u2013 and you\u2019ll hear me say this a lot \u2013 it\u2019s only one poll. Anyone who tells you it\u2019s a done deal after last night is probably influenced by confirmation bias which when you interpret new information (eg this poll) in a way that confirms your existing beliefs (eg \u201cI think Clinton did pretty well\u201d). </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/26/debate-fact-check-trump-clinton-live-quotes-hofstra\">Presidential debate fact-check: Trump and Clinton's claims reviewed</a> </p> </aside>  <p>What actually does offer some promise of predicting voter behavior is taking a big bunch of surveys, each reputable, each with a slightly different methodology, and averaging them out.

  "<p>If you think Snapchat is only used in universities by students documenting their antics in the pub, you may be missing a marketing trick.

The account picked up 106 new followers on the first day, and young people even started to contact them directly about Clearing on Snapchat.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/2016/jan/20/eight-smart-ways-to-use-social-media-in-universities\">Eight smart ways to use social media in universities</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But Christie points out that the main idea was to give young people a space to share thoughts with one another about starting their university lives. \u201cIt is user-to-user interaction, and we are the facilitators,\u201d she says.<br></p> <p>For a platform like Snapchat, which is all about being informal and spontaneous, it\u2019s sensible to take a step back and create a place for your audience to share ideas, rather than just promoting your university. But the thought of ceding control in this way can bring some marketers out in a cold sweat. Christie says the key is to find and deliver a message in an authentic and original way that \u201cdoesn\u2019t sound corporate\u201d. </p> <p>\u201cWe worked a lot on the tone and types of stories we wanted to tell, to make them more about real life and real people, rather than pushing a message,\u201d she says.<br></p> <h2>Documenting travel adventures</h2> <p>Newcastle University used Snapchat to follow three undergraduates on their research trips to Chile, the Arctic Circle and an archaeology dig in Lufton in the UK. Each project had a 24-hour feature slot on Snapchat, which was chosen by the team for its natural, impromptu feel.</p> <p>\u201cWith Instagram, people feel they need to share the perfect picture,\u201d says Matt Horne, digital marketing and social media officer at the university. \u201cBut Snapchat is more in the moment and is easier \u2013 you can create these stories, then they are gone.\u201d </p> <p>Weren\u2019t they worried about letting students loose with an official university social media account? Horne explains that it is possible to monitor Snapchat account from a different device \u2013 if you see something untoward, you can log on and override the student \u2013 but stresses that they didn\u2019t need to use this function.</p> <p>\u201cWe set the ground rules, and our students are really trustworthy,\u201d says Horne. \u201cBut it\u2019s good to know you have an emergency stop button if you need it, especially when they are away.\u201d<br></p> <p> It was hard to measure the outcome of this experiment, however, because Snapchat isn\u2019t set up for businesses, so there are very few analytics available. </p> <p>Newcastle\u2019s team chose to screenshot every picture before it expired, as Snapchat shows engagement statistics. This process is manually tedious, Horne admits, but gave them the information they needed to see where users dropped off. The story overview list also collates this information, but in less detail.</p> <p>Horne\u2019s advice for others is to become familiar with the Snapchat software before setting up an official account. \u201cFollow other accounts, see what they are doing, and how you can fit in,\u201d he says. <br></p> <h2>Celebrating graduation</h2> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/2016/feb/03/how-social-media-can-help-universities-in-times-of-tragedy\">How social media can help universities in times of tragedy</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Loughborough University has been using Snapchat since June 2015, and currently has more than 4,000 followers. \u201cWe use it for a variety of reasons \u2013 recruitment, internal comms, raising awareness of events and showing the student experience,\u201d says Liam Ross, digital engagement officer at the university. <br></p> <p>Their most successful campaign was this year\u2019s graduation celebrations. The university set up #LboroGrad2016 and invited students and soon-to-be graduates to share their pictures from the day. \u201cThey took the story where we couldn\u2019t go,\u201d says Ross. \u201cIt gave it a personal touch which other students could connect with.\u201d<br></p> <p>Many students also shared their snaps on other social networks, such as Twitter and Instagram. Ross advises university marketers to follow the students\u2019 lead: \u201cYou need to signpost Snapchat from your other social media platforms and email comms, to build your follower count.\u201d<br></p> <p>The campaign used \u201cgeofilters\u201d (overlays that tell you where and when the snap was taken). These boosted the reach of the campaign and helped with analytics, because Snapchat provides figures on how many filters are used. Loughborough\u2019s frames were used 1,200 times and viewed 126,000 times. This information helped the team build a broader picture of engagement, and proved the success of the campaign.</p> <p><strong>Join the <a href=\"http://preview.gutools.co.uk/higher-education-network#https://register.theguardian.com/higher-education/?CMP=dis_57\">higher education network</a> for more comment, analysis and job opportunities, direct to your inbox.

When conceptions of identity have become fragmented, individualistic and consumption-driven, what is our common cause?</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It\u2019s the workers most vulnerable to casualisation and low-pay who are least likely to have union representation</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It\u2019s not that the problems that Labour was founded to address have been solved. Not in any real sense. But they\u2019ve mutated in a way that our movement is struggling to catch up with. What is our response to the rise in poverty-level self-employment? How can we defend the welfare state when many of those who benefit are baying for its destruction, on the basis that others benefit more? How can we effectively challenge the erosion of hard-won employment rights through zero-hours contracts and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/27/low-paid-workers-sports-direct-university-staff-rights-mike-ashley\" title=\"\">other forms of labour casualisation</a>?</p> <p>Admittedly, there has been some progress on that front. If there\u2019s been any uniting theme of the conference it is virulent condemnation of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/nils-pratley-on-finance/2016/sep/05/bloody-mindedness-isnt-working-for-sports-direct\" title=\"\">Mike Ashley</a>, who has overseen a regime of exploitation and zero-hours insecurity in his role as Sports Direct proprietor. Speaker after speaker has castigated Ashley\u2019s business practices as inhuman and Dickensian, to guaranteed enthusiastic applause.</p> <p>It\u2019s not enough, though. For all of the rhetoric, the reality is that trade union membership has long been in decline. Even more troublingly, it\u2019s the workers most vulnerable to casualisation, low-pay and underemployment who are least likely to have union representation. To what extent can the Labour party claim to speak for ordinary working people when the movement it is founded on is failing to convince those people it can help.</p> <p>I sat on a panel on Monday where a young woman explained that she\u2019d not been able to join a trade union as an apprentice \u2013 earning well below the so-called living wage of \u00a37.20 that has been introduced for people over the age of 25 \u2013 because the union active in her workplace didn\u2019t offer a reduced rate that took into account her lower earnings. Other women spoke about feeling excluded by a macho culture that infested the labour movement, and about the lack of attention given to parenting and the need for workplace flexibility.</p> <p>Harking back to past victories reminds us why the Labour party was created, so it\u2019s no surprise that speakers from all factions have made mention of the minimum wage, gender equality legislation and the founding of the NHS. What\u2019s sorely lacking, however, is any sort of coherent vision for the future.</p> <p>There seem to be two extreme camps dominating \u2013 though many members find themselves stuck somewhere in the middle desperately hoping for a resolution. On one side are those who wish to operate as if nothing has really changed since the mid-1970s. Though popular understanding of class, community and the role of the welfare state has altered wildly in recent decades, they\u2019re still using the same language they always have and expecting it to resonate with voters.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/27/low-paid-workers-sports-direct-university-staff-rights-mike-ashley\">Think only low\u2013paid workers get the Sports Direct treatment?

Those who contend that the labour movement is dead in the water and that a viable Labour party has to develop different focuses and priorities. These are the people who argued that it was a mistake for Ed Miliband to criticise zero-hours contracts in the run-up to the last general election, as it gave the impression he was \u201canti-business\u201d.</p> <p>The solution, surely, cannot come from either of these camps. If Labour abandons its commitment to improving the circumstances of working people it\u2019s hard to even see why it should survive. At the same time, the political context has changed enormously in recent years, and ignoring that will condemn the party to electoral irrelevance.</p> <p>We need to find a way to make the union movement, and the party of the union movement, relevant to the 21st century. If Labour has something to offer the majority of ordinary people we need to find a way to communicate that. And until we figure that out, we need to accept that the problem isn\u2019t with voters, it\u2019s with us.</p>",

So if you look with the right kind of eyes you can see it in his loping strides and his broad backside, how he leans forward as he walks, as if perpetually set against a stiff wind.

Like how to check the direction of the prevailing wind at Lord\u2019s by looking at the aeroplanes making their approach to Heathrow overhead.</p> <p>After 31 years, Selve has left the building. Last week he wrote <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/23/middlesex-yorkshire-county-championship-division-one-match-report-cricket\" title=\"\">his final match report for the Guardian</a>. There wasn\u2019t another journalist in the press box who had been with their employer for longer. It was, most appropriately, about Middlesex\u2019s victory against Yorkshire at Lord\u2019s, which won them the County Championship for the 13th time, and the first since 1993. He had a hand in four of those 13 titles, in 1976, 77, 80, and 82.</p> <p>He wrote his first piece for the paper in October 1984, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2016/sep/23/county-cricket-three-way-title-race-goes-to-the-final-day-live?page=with:block-57e4ffd2e4b0fcb95da8fcd3#block-57e4ffd2e4b0fcb95da8fcd3\" title=\"\">and his first match report the following year</a>, on the day\u2019s play between Essex and Cambridge University at Fenner\u2019s. It ran alongside a lengthy preview of the British Open Squash Championships, and a long report on the progress made at the Crucible by a 20-year-old snooker player named John Parrott. All of which gives you an idea of how newspapers have changed since.</p> <p>One of the many things I learned from him, along with a selection of his favourite spots for sundowners, was that you need to know when to watch. A knack he has, and which enables him to finish the Times\u2019 cryptic without missing a wicket, but one I\u2019m still trying to acquire, which is why I so often find myself snapped from my laptop by the match. I was practising last Friday morning, searching through the Guardian archives while the game meandered towards that famous final session.</p> <p>Selve\u2019s first article was a guide to India, just in time for England\u2019s 1984 tour. It includes the following advice: \u201cIt was Keith Fletcher who introduced me to the pleasures of drinking Scotch whisky by insisting I drank a tumblerful last thing at night, in an effort, he said, to kill any stomach bugs. My advice to this year\u2019s tourists is: stock up well on the duty-frees, because while it may not be the elixir of life it might quell any rumbles on the sub-continent. And even if it doesn\u2019t, it is one hell of a pleasant way to prove someone wrong.\u201d</p> <p>As I said, expert gleanings.</p> <p>When I showed it to Selve, he revealed that it had been written on a commission from Matthew Engel, his immediate predecessor as correspondent. Engel hadn\u2019t provided any instructions about how to call in copy over the phone, so instead Selve typed it up, tucked it into an envelope, and travelled up to the Guardian\u2019s office in Farringdon Road, then spent two hours in the lobby waiting for the sports editor to come back from a long lunch so he could deliver it in person.</p> <p>But these are Selve\u2019s stories, and the store is reduced by expenditure. I should spare him my using more of them here and reflect, instead, on whether he may be one of the last of his type, a top player who turned to journalism. Cricket is unusual among sports in that so many of its players decide to start a second career in the press box when they are done playing the game.</p> <p>Oh, plenty still moonlight as columnists and analysts, but being a correspondent is a different kind of job. It is a profession, one that requires the willingness to craft your own stories rather than have a ghost writer set them down for you, the ability to condense the detail of each day\u2019s play, and deliver a report to a tight deadline. Selve is one of a band who made the switch in the last few decades, along with Vic Marks, Derek Pringle, Steve James, Mike Atherton, Gus Fraser, and, though he never played a full international, Peter Roebuck.</p> <p>Seems to me there could be two reasons why there will likely be few others who do it. One would be that six of those seven men studied at Oxford or Cambridge. Whatever you think they might have got from it, whether it was the habit of writing, confidence, contacts, or an eye-catching CV, probably depends on your personal prejudices about those places. But it cannot just be coincidence. And far fewer cricketers come through by that route these days, even though the MCCU programme means they can now play first-class cricket at six universities, rather than one of those original two.</p> <p>The larger part of it may just be a question of money. Cricketers have become richer, as newspapers have grown poorer. And an international player now earns enough that, even if they did have the inclination to make the switch, most papers would struggle to offer them a wage that might make it seem worth their while. There is a wealth of good writing about the game around right now, from authors across the world, and with all manner of backgrounds. The internet has opened this business up to all manner of amateurs, and cricket is better for it, but it may yet close it off to those dedicated professionals who made it their living.</p> <p><em>This is an extract taken from the Spin, the Guardian\u2019s weekly cricket email.

  "<p>The poet and critic Bernard Bergonzi, who has died aged 87, was long associated with the teaching of 20th-century English literature at Warwick University. His books shed new light on the English writing of the first world war and the 1930s, and on developments in criticism since the 60s, which he largely disliked. Monographs on HG Wells, TS Eliot, Gerard Manley Hopkins, Thomas Arnold and Graham Greene showed Bergonzi at his sensible and lucid best.</p> <p>Though principally known as a critic, it was as a poet that Bergonzi began to find a place in the English literary scene in the early 50s. Within a year of beginning research on the early writings of Wells in 1958, he was appointed assistant lecturer at Manchester University. A full lectureship soon followed. He published two books while at Manchester: The Early HG Wells (1961) and a study of the literature of the first world war, Heroes\u2019 Twilight (1965), in which he gave innovative attention to David Jones and the nearly forgotten Henry Williamson. In the following year he was appointed senior lecturer at Warwick, where he remained until he formally retired in 1992. He became professor of English in 1971 and served as pro-vice-chancellor from 1979 until 1982. His career was closely tied to the ascending fortunes of the Warwick English department.</p> <p>For a time Bergonzi sought to be something of an arbiter of contemporary writing. A series of talks, Novelists of the Sixties, was broadcast on the Third Programme and he became a frequent contributor to the New York Review of Books. He edited Innovations (1968), an influential collection of essays on the avant garde, which may have given the impression that he was devoted to experimental writing. He was not. In The Situation of the Novel (1970), he expressed much liberal bafflement at the \u201cfacile apocalypticism\u201d of 60s fiction.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"653799453b0a3e679b1f84df949eb76a3e9a90cd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/653799453b0a3e679b1f84df949eb76a3e9a90cd/40_25_355_592/300.jpg\" alt=\"The Early HG Wells, 1961\" width=\"300\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Early HG Wells, 1961</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: No credit</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Writers such as Thomas Pynchon began to make their presence felt in Bergonzi\u2019s writing. But his book hardly celebrated new cultural energies. Nor was he particularly interested in American literature or French critical theories. In truth he posed \u201cthe ideology of being English\u201d as a direct challenge to the cult of experimentalism. The English, he wrote, are an untheoretical people, who cherish their idiosyncrasies and amateurishness, and have a distaste for the systematic and the doctrinaire. Bergonzi hoped that \u201chappy enclave of tradition and liberalism\u201d might long endure.</p> <p>He wrote with gusto against the perversity of Marxist, structuralist and psychoanalytic criticism. Feminist criticism seemed to him little more than special pleading. In The Myth of Modernism (1986) and Exploding English (1990) he argued that the gang of theorisers led by Terry Eagleton would find a happier home outside traditional English departments. The emergence of theory in literary education was itself a \u201csymptom of disorder\u201d. He deplored the fact that literary judgment no longer seemed to have a place in the global anglophone academy. Remaining true to the idea of evaluative criticism, he proposed an English degree course that would concentrate on the study of poetry, without its \u201cculturalist\u201d baggage. In all this, Bergonzi thought of himself as a defender of humane values against leftwing onslaughts.</p> <p>His biographical and critical study TS Eliot appeared in 1972, avoiding the awkward personal questions about Eliot\u2019s marriage and his politics that increasingly preoccupied critics in the decades after Eliot\u2019s death in 1965. When the lawyer and academic Anthony Julius raised important questions of antisemitism in Eliot\u2019s work in TS Eliot, Antisemitism and Literary Form (1996), Bergonzi was fair-minded in responding to a topic that he had largely ignored in his own study.</p> <p>He attempted a wider survey of the major figures of the 30s in Reading the Thirties (1978). To his credit, when discussing the rightwing writers of that decade Bergonzi did not duck the question of Wyndham Lewis\u2019s admiration for fascism, or Roy Campbell\u2019s authoritarianism and Catholic triumphalism. But the politics of that supremely political generation is downplayed. Bergonzi published a critical b iography of Gerard Manley Hopkins in 1977, and in 1981 The Roman Persuasion, a novel set in 1936-38, about a pious Catholic literary family negotiating the perilous political crises of that decade. It offers a counter-history to the mythologies of the antifascist left in the 30s. As a novel, the family councils of the Cartwrights and Tolleybeares perhaps go on a bit too long about the church\u2019s \u201cinfallible wisdom\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"5c51dc65ba00be9f4ff258f1804b181946783444\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5c51dc65ba00be9f4ff258f1804b181946783444/0_0_301_479/301.jpg\" alt=\"A Victorian Wanderer, 2003\" width=\"301\" height=\"479\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Victorian Wanderer, 2003</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: No credit</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In 1982 an essay by Bergonzi was included in Why I Am Still a Catholic, a collection edited by Robert Nowell. Bergonzi remained a lifelong practising Catholic, though of a distinctly liberal temperament. Occasionally describing himself as a \u201cpapist critic,\u201d he was a man of the second Vatican council, and the winds of change that were blowing through the church in the 60s.</p> <p><a href=\"http://timewitnesses.org/english/doodbug.html\">Bernard was born in Lewisham</a>, south-east London, the son of Carlo Bergonzi, a dance band musician in the 20s and later a white-collar worker in factories, and his wife Louisa (nee Lloyd). Ill-health, which resulted in an operation on his ear in 1937, dogged his childhood but spared him what he later came to regard as \u201cignorant and unenlightened\u201d Catholic schooling.</p> <p>Strong on the need for authority and discipline and deeply suspicious of private judgment, Catholicism in the 40s was a difficult natural home for an inquiring spirit such as Bergonzi. He caused some consternation when he asked his parish priest if he might see a copy of the Index Librorum Prohibitorum, the list of books and authors proscribed by the church to which Jean-Paul Sartre was added in 1948 and Andr\u00e9 Gide in 1952. (The Index was discontinued in 1966.) Bergonzi found few English writers on it, but was quietly shocked at how questions about the Index, and whether it actually applied to his own reading, were dismissed as being of little consequence.</p> <p>After leaving school before his 16th birthday, he worked as a junior clerk in the City, and continued to read widely if unsystematically in Catholic books and periodicals. The wartime Faber edition of Eliot\u2019s collected poems, bought in 1946, had pride of place in his small library. He read successive issues of Penguin New Writing, greatly admiring an essay by <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-john-wain-1438370.html\">John Wain</a> on William Empson in the last number in 1950. Bergonzi thought of himself as an autodidact, not unlike the unfortunate Leonard Bast in EM Forster\u2019s Howards End.</p> <p>In his 20s he began to write poetry, strongly influenced by Eliot. Two of his poems were featured in Wain\u2019s radio series First Reading on the Third Programme in 1953. Later that year he participated in a reading to launch Springtime, an anthology of poetry edited by GS Fraser and Iain Fletcher. Kingsley Amis, who was also a contributor, wrote to Philip Larkin the day after the reading that \u201ca chap named Bernard Benghazi or some such name was good, I thought\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"f04a2dc21f36a5c1d7684dc3e22692314f6822ae\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f04a2dc21f36a5c1d7684dc3e22692314f6822ae/4_0_321_494/321.jpg\" alt=\"Heroes\u2019 Twilight, 1965, by Bernard Bergonzi\" width=\"321\" height=\"494\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Heroes\u2019 Twilight, 1965, by Bernard Bergonzi</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: No Credit</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Bergonzi contributed to George Hartley\u2019s literary magazine Listen in 1954 and became co-editor of the later numbers of Oscar Mellor\u2019s Fantasy Poets series. Godolphin &amp; Other Poems appeared in 1952. A more substantial collection, Descartes and the Animals, followed in 1954. Three small-press pamphlets of poems, containing careful, disciplined and thoughtful work, were subsequently published.</p> <p>At the suggestion of Fraser, in the autumn of 1953 Bergonzi enrolled at Newbattle Abbey, an adult residential college near Edinburgh. In 1955 he won a mature entrant scholarship at Wadham College, Oxford, where his tutor was FW Bateson. Bergonzi was an active member of the Critical Society, founded by Al Alvarez in the early 50s, and became friends with Martin Dodsworth and Christopher Ricks. He thought of himself as an ambitious, upwardly mobile scholarship boy.</p> <p>The energy he displayed as a writer continued well after he became professor emeritus. His broad range of interests, and approach to the business of introducing literature to the general public, changed little over the decades. Wartime and Aftermath (1993), a study of English literature and its background in the 40s and 50s, drew heavily on his earlier publications and established judgments. War Poets and Other Subjects appeared in 1999. A Victorian Wanderer (2003), a biography of Thomas Arnold, brother of the Victorian poet, was warmly received. It was followed by A Study in Greene (2006).</p> <p>Deploring those academics who chose to write for each other in jargon-laden prose, Bergonzi particularly objected to the way theorists seemed to ignore general readers. He was undogmatically certain that he had always written with those readers in mind, however much England and Englishness had changed since he began his career as a writer and teacher.</p> <p>He is survived by his second wife, Anne Samson, whom he married in 1987, and three children, Ben, Clarissa and Lucy, by his first wife, Gabriel Wall, who died in 1984.<br><br><strong>Eric Homberger</strong></p> <p><strong>David Lodge writes:</strong> Bernard Bergonzi was one of my oldest friends. We met for the first time at a conference in Cambridge in 1961, when Bernard told me he had recently read my first novel, The Picturegoers (1960), and recognised its setting as the rather shabby part of south-east London, incorporating Lewisham, New Cross and Brockley, where like me he had grown up. He was six years older, but we had other things in common: both Catholics, both only children (an unusual combination) of lower-middle-class parents, both in the early stages of academic careers, specialising in modern literature, trying to add to it in poetry and fiction respectively, and earning extra income from reviewing.</p> <p>When Bernard moved with his family from Manchester to the new Warwick University, less than an hour from Birmingham, where I was a lecturer, the friendship developed to include regular Sunday lunches at both venues. After the devastating death of his first wife, Gabriel, from cancer at the age of 46, this custom was revived during his second marriage, to Anne. I always looked forward to these meetings because we had plenty to talk about: new books, our current projects, literary and academic gossip, and the state of the Catholic church. Bernard took a particular interest in my novels that dealt with this last subject, and wrote perceptively but not uncritically about them.</p> <p>In his prime he was an imposing figure, confident, witty and urbane, a man of letters in a traditional mould, and this was a personal triumph over a disadvantaged childhood, including two years in hospital that seriously retarded his education. The long row of his books on my shelves display an impressively wide knowledge of modern literature and culture, communicated in effortlessly readable prose at a time when academic criticism became increasingly heavy with jargon. Bernard deplored the impact on his profession of structuralism and poststructuralism, in which I found some ideas of value, but unlike many hostile commentators he read the work of their proponents carefully and described it fairly. He was a gentleman of letters.</p> <p><em>\u2022 </em>Bernard Bergonzi, poet, critic and academic, born 13 April 1929; died 20 September 2016</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 29 September 2016. An earlier version said an essay by Bergonzi appeared in a 1982 collection, Why I Am Still a Catholic, edited by Peter Stanford. That collection was edited by Robert Nowell.</p>",
  "<p>The most disappointing thing about the renovations in our local bar is the bar itself, which is smaller, straighter and no longer has a \u201clip\u201d. The old bar, which was shaped like a sickle and could accommodate any number from two to 22, had a lip on the outside about halfway up which served three purposes: to support the glass cabinet above, to collect crumbs, and provide a ledge for small customers. Like every other child in Testaccio, as soon as my son was able to stand, he balanced on the lip so he too could lean against the bar for breakfast. He noticed the lack of lip immediately and did the obvious thing: he kicked the bar. On our way out, I kicked the table, though not deliberately \u2013 I was distracted by the fact they no longer have two doors, meaning a bar that used to flow now has a constant bottleneck. Missing lip and facelift apart, when Maurizio is behind the coffee machine, the cappuccino is still good, its milk in thick folds, the espresso fine, and their <em>maritozzi</em> (Rome\u2019s answer to a sticky, cream-filled bun) gorgeous. We will keep going, but I may feel like kicking things for a while yet.</p> <p>I am used to coming back to changes after the long summer break, but this year it was a bit much. It is not just our local bar. Bar Moka, a true Roman market bar with coffee so strong and thick you shuddered, has also been gutted, and the canteen-like <em>tavola calda</em> Volpetti Pi\u00f9 torn apart and put back together again. I know things change, but I can\u2019t help feeling nostalgic about the places I latched on to when I first arrived in Rome, and returned to faithfully \u2013 my way of becoming part of this tight-knit community, maybe. I remember one of my first meals in the functional bustle of old Volpetti, hunter\u2019s-style rabbit and flat green beans braised in tomato sauce. Food memories can be persistent buggers: I can recall exactly how those beans tasted. I was with my friend Alice and we had a silent why-is-this-so-good moment. Great ingredients, she said, and loads of olive oil and salt added at the right point to bring out other flavours and lend that silky, lip-smacking feel. Our lips shone. The ancient Romans called a man in love <em tabindex=\"-1\">salax</em> \u2013 in a salted state \u2013 which is the origin of the word salacious, which is taking my feelings for a plate of beans a bit far, I know, but you get the idea.</p> <p>My friend and superb cook Carla always reminds me that vegetables love salt and good fats \u2013 extra virgin olive oil, pork fat, butter \u2013 that they are essential in transformation and taste. This week\u2019s recipe for smothered cabbage \u2013 which is as good as it is economic and easy, a winner for the student cooks among you \u2013 uses all three: olive oil is my constant companion, and cabbage loves pork and butter. That said, in the original recipe \u2013 or rather, idea \u2013 <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/essentials-of-classic-italian-cooking.html\">Marcella Hazan</a> only uses olive oil. Smothered \u2013 <em>sofegao </em>in Venetian \u2013 is a lovely concept: something cooked covered so it softens in its own moisture mingled with fats and a small amount of vinegar, which gives a nice sharp edge. I think of salting as a series of small pushes rather than one great shove. I add tiny pinches as I go, with the onion, with the raw cabbage, after the vinegar, and again at the end. Not over-salting, but just enough: obviously \u201cenough\u201d is personal, and with salt tied up with health, you are in charge.</p> <p>It takes at least an hour. By the end, the cabbage should be incredibly soft and deeply flavoured. Be generous with the black pepper: its heat and spice are vital. Sausages are a natural partner here. Alternatively, the cabbage could be stirred through rice, mixed with boiled potatoes, or topped with a fried egg. Yesterday my friend and I had sausage, my partner Vincenzo had an egg, and my son Luca demanded both. After, we went to the bar for an espresso.</p> <p>It may look like a stranger, but it is still our local bar, like hundreds of other bars through Rome, independent and democratic places, where you pay 80 cents, stand at the bar with your finger on a coin on the receipt, in the background the hiss of the machine, until a small white cup filled with an inch of dark liquid is put in front of you. You drink it back. I am not sure how long I will feel cross about the facelift. Luca has already got over it, the new leather seats are just the thing for sliding.</p> <h2><strong>Smothered cabbage with sausages</strong></h2> <p><strong>Serves 4</strong><br>900g white, green or savoy cabbage<br>A large white onion<br>75g pancetta or bacon<br>2 tbsp olive oil<br>60g butter<br>Salt and black pepper<br>1\u20133 tbsp red wine vinegar<br>4 large/8 small or a rope of sausage</p> <p><strong>1</strong> Discard the tough outer leaves of the cabbage, cut into quarters, cut away the tough core and then shred each quarter.</p> <p><strong>2</strong> Peel and thinly slice the onion and dice the pancetta.

  "<p>Andrew Strauss, the director of England cricket, will on Wednesday announce the most significant overhaul of the central contract structure since its inception with the introduction of new \u201cwhite-ball\u201d deals that, in some cases, could triple the amount of money paid to limited-overs specialists.</p> <p>Strauss is keen to address an imbalance that has previously seen the Test side given priority over the one-day and Twenty20 teams, having long spoken about the issue since<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/may/09/andrew-strauss-confirmed-director-england-cricket-ecb\" title=\"\"> his appointment in May last year</a> following <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2015/mar/13/england-odi-cricket-world-cup\" title=\"\">England\u2019s harrowing World Cup campaign</a>.</p> <p>A considerable step towards achieving this will be made when the England and Wales Cricket Board name the recipients of central contracts for 2016-17, as part of a revamped system that will mean deals are divided along Test and limited-overs lines with players who feature in all formats awarded two salaries.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/27/cricket-writers-awards-2016-ben-duckett-keaton-jennings-charlotte-edwards\">Cricket writers\u2019 2016 awards for Ben Duckett, Keaton Jennings and Charlotte Edwards</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Under the previous structure, central contracts were handed to mainstays of the Test side, with fringe players and those who only featured in limited-overs cricket given \u201cincrement\u201d contracts which earned them a flat fee of around \u00a350,000 on top of their county salaries, following a totting up of appearances. Eoin Morgan, the one-day and Twenty20 captain, was the only limited-overs specialist to earn a central contract last year.</p> <p>But now red-ball and white-ball cricket will be treated as separate entities, with salaries in each based on a grading system in terms of a player\u2019s importance to each setup. It means the likes of Joe Root, Ben Stokes and Moeen Ali, who are first-team regulars in all three formats, will be the biggest beneficiaries from the dual-contract system.</p> <p>Despite the split, only Test contracts will retain all the features in place under the previous central contract system, which mean England take over the player\u2019s county contracts and have full control over their schedule. The white-ball contracts, in the case of specialists such as Morgan, Jason Roy and Alex Hales, will still sit on top of their country earnings like the increment deals they replace.</p> <p>But rather than the flat fee that previously existed, the grading system will earn the best players significantly more \u2013 understood to be up to \u00a3160,000 in some cases \u2013 meaning that for the first time since central contracts were introduced in 2000, cricketers who specialise in white-ball cricket could earn more than some of their Test counterparts, whose salaries, in some cases, could now be reduced.</p> <p>As well as being paid by their white-ball contracts and county deals, one-day specialists will also be able to seek employment in Twenty20 leagues overseas such as the Indian Premier League and Australia\u2019s Big Bash League, thus making it a more attractive international career path than ever before. England, however, would still retain the right to veto any such stints should they believe a player needs a rest.</p> <p>Speaking at the start of September, Strauss said: \u201cWe have spoken ad nauseam about taking white-ball cricket more seriously and creating a balance but I don\u2019t think our system, as it stands, does that. We are working on a system that does that better.\u201d</p> <p>It remains to be seen whether this new contract structure is a holding pattern, however, with Strauss essentially reworking a budget that remains pegged to current broadcast rights, which run until the end of the 2019 home season.</p> <p>In the short term, increased money for one-day players is welcomed by them and the latest innovation by Strauss as he looks to turn England, the only major Test nation not to win a 50-over ICC tournament, into challengers for next year\u2019s Champions Trophy and the 2019 World Cup, both of which are being held on home soil.</p> <p>His reign has already allowed England to become more flexible in terms of players featuring in overseas Twenty20 leagues, while he has also created a North&#xa0;v South series that begins in March next year in the United Arab Emirates as a proving ground for the next-best one-day players in county cricket.</p>",
  "<h2>Clinton, Holt put Trump on defensive</h2> <p>Goaded by Clinton and pressed by moderator Lester Holt, Donald Trump angrily defended his record against charges of racism, sexism and tax avoidance for much of the first presidential debate. The Republican candidate blamed the nation\u2019s chronic problems on Clinton, while also appearing thin-skinned and under-prepared as he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/26/trump-sniffles-presidential-debate-clinton-hofstra\">sniffled</a> his way through the debate.

  "<p>One morning this month the families of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/08/50-people-snatched-deported-jamaica-uk-immigration\" title=\"\">more than 40 people deported on a private charter flight</a> to Jamaica experienced the overwhelming loss of relatives being taken thousands of miles away from the communities where many had lived for decades.</p> <p>But what\u2019s next? Many on the charter plane were issued with a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2001/jul/19/mpsurgery18\" title=\"\">so-called right to appeal after being deported</a>. This is increasingly issued to people removed on an individual basis via commercial flights, and to the many deported to countries such as Nigeria, Ghana, Jamaica, Pakistan and Albania. However, while the British Home Office recently commissioned a <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/world-location-news/british-high-commission-abuja-donates-returns-reception-centre-to-nigeria-immigration-service\" title=\"\">\u201creturns reception centre\u201d for deportees arriving in Nigeria</a>, it offers <a href=\"https://www.opendemocracy.net/uk/shinealight/lotte-lewis-smith-and-mark-umunna/special-gift-from-uk-to-nigeria-promoting-human-rights-or-se\" title=\"\">no further support</a> for those who wish to continue their legal battle after removal.</p> <p>Guidance from the Home Office states: \u201cWhen a person brings or continues an appeal relating to a protection claim from outside the UK \u2026 the appeal is to be treated as if the person were not outside the UK.\u201d However, Jasmine Sallis, a founding member of <a href=\"http://rootstoreturn.wixsite.com/home\" title=\"\">Roots to Return</a> \u2013 set up to support individuals pursuing out-of-country appeals \u2013 said: \u201cThe very fact that the individual is appealing from outside the UK means that an out-of-country appeal cannot be pursued, prepared for or processed in the same way that an in-country appeal is.\u201d</p> <p>In fact, the Home Office acknowledges explicitly that the government\u2019s approach to out-of-country appeals is to do as little as possible to comply with the European convention on human rights. As is stated on letters to appellants: \u201cAlthough an out-of-country appeal may be less advantageous \u2026 than in country, article 8 [of the convention] does not require that the appellant have access to the best possible procedure, only access to a procedure that meets the essential requirements of effectiveness and fairness.\u201d</p> <p>Once removed from the UK, people often find themselves destitute with little money or job prospects, and no connections or resources to pursue an appeal \u2013 which requires a UK-based lawyer or representative, \u00a3140 to lodge the appeal within the 28-day deadline and access to evidence supporting a human rights or asylum claim. If it is a human rights claim or a family-based one, the evidence will be in the UK \u2013 and thus extremely difficult to gather from abroad.</p> <p>The difficulties are clear from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/aug/10/nationalities-targeted-deportation-charter-planes-home-office\" title=\"\">Unity Centre</a>\u2019s experiences supporting individuals pursuing out-of-country appeals. One man, claiming asylum in the UK, was forcibly removed to Bangladesh and attempted to pursue an out-of-country appeal. Upon removal, he found himself homeless and severely ill \u2013 unable even to afford a call to a lawyer in the UK, let alone pay the appeal fee.</p> <p>In anther case, a man forcibly removed to Nigeria on a charter flight was unable to pursue his \u201cright\u201d to an appeal because he was in hiding from state officials he had fled from by travelling to the UK in the first place. As it was dangerous to use a phone, he was forced to communicate with us at Roots to Return, through his mother.</p> <p>Just as the Home Office suggests that deportees can maintain connections with their children through Skype, appellants are expected to give evidence at appeal hearings via video link \u2013 for which there is currently a waiting list of up to 18 months. And as organisations such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/may/01/romanian-sex-workers-challenge-uk-immigration-policy\" title=\"\">the Aire Centre</a> have noted, the logistics of organising these appeals are difficult, and the responsibility and financial costs fall to the appellant.</p> <p>We spoke to lawyers across the UK, and most made it clear that they had little capacity to take on appeals from abroad, noting the practical complications when compared with in-country appeals. The ones that had capacity charged at least \u00a32,500.</p> <p>The success rate for appeals was just 13% in the year up to August 2015, the year in which the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/oct/13/uk-appeal-court-backs-deport-first-appeal-later-policy-for-foreign-prisoners\" title=\"\">Deport first, appeal later</a>\u201d policy came into force. However, two years before, the success rate was twice that, at 26% \u2013 demonstrating an alarming level of poor Home Office decision-making, with so many rulings overturned by the courts. This policy also affects EU nationals, so the legal pressure is likely to increase as European nationals fight to establish their right to remain in the UK after the Brexit vote.</p> <p>The very procedure of an out-of-country appeal creates the conditions for these appeals to be unsuccessful \u2013 let alone be lodged in the first place: from July 2014 to August 2015 only 426 (25%) appealed against deportation, a marked drop from the 2,329 who had appealed in the year to April 2013.</p> <p>All this is severely damaging the role of appeals as a vital part of accessing justice in the UK. People forcibly removed are even less likely to pursue out-of-country appeals now that appeal fees for an oral hearing have increased by almost 500%, from \u00a3140 to \u00a3800. The British government imposes this increase despite a consultation exercise in which all but five of 147 responses opposed it.</p> <p>Under the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/immigration-bill-receives-royal-assent\" title=\"\">2016 Immigration Act</a>, the \u201cDeport first, appeal later\u201d policy is to be rolled out to all immigration cases. One of the aims of the legislation was to increase powers \u201cto make it easier to remove people who have no right to be in the UK\u201d. Deporting people before the very appeal that will determine whether they have the \u201cright\u201d to be in the UK or not clearly demonstrates the Home Office\u2019s priority: deportation, regardless of justice.</p> <p>\u2022If you have been deported and want to pursue an out-of-country appeal, please contact <a href=\"rootstoreturn@gmail.com\" title=\"\">rootstoreturn@gmail.com</a></p>",
  "<p>What the hell is wrong with this year? David Bowie has gone. Prince has been taken far too soon. NoMeansNo have split up. Brexit looks set to wreak financial havoc on those British subjects least able to afford it. America is sleepwalking into disaster with Donald Trump. The Labour party seems damaged beyond immediate repair. Terrifying sabre-rattling with Russia has begun over Syria \u2026 Hold up. Rewind a second there. Who have split up?</p> <p>After 37 years, the defiantly underground (AKA unpopular) Canadian rock trio, NoMeansNo \u2013 who mixed noise, jazz, funk, dubstep, heavy metal, hardcore, prog, free improvisation and avant-rock into their sound, while never really straying too far from their Ramones-worshipping roots \u2013 have finally called it a day. And now, I\u2019m going to explain (via the means of list of 10 reasons) why we\u2019re all a shower of shivering, narrow-shouldered bastards for letting this appalling calumny occur. </p> <h2>1. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6RP4w1CzD8\">The River (1993)</a></h2> <p>NoMeansNo were the greatest punk band ever. And now they\u2019re gone. I hope you\u2019re all satisfied \u2013 you bunch of massive whoppers. And now that I\u2019ve vented, we can proceed. <br></p> <h2>2. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0e1PwljrIc\">Ghosts (1991)</a></h2> <p>NoMeansNo were formed as a duo in Victoria, Canada in 1979 by brothers John (drums, vocals) and Rob Wright (bass, vocals). They would expand to a trio with Andy Kerr and, later, Tom Holliston on guitars. As well as following directly on from the likes of Canadian hardcore pioneers DOA, their earliest material shows the influence of such postpunk groups as Joy Division and new wave acts like Devo. They continually raged against the constraints of onetwothreefour rock and embraced the supposed contradiction of being punks who were fans of prog. Their stars aligned briefly in 1989 with the release of Wrong, their most popular album, which came out on Jello Biafra\u2019s Alternative Tentacles label. While a fantastically intense document and must-own LP, it still really doesn\u2019t showcase the band at full stretch lyrically or musically. But in typical millennial, post-music style, their narrative has seen them reduced to the status of a one-album proposition. Tired of always being asked to perform Wrong-in-its-entirety gigs and of the growing indifference to their later (but still fantastic) records, they have now called it a day. But take a look at any of their albums or EPs and you will find gem after gem, such as this remorseless grinder from 0+2=1, for example. <br></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kvYDcvQRERw\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/kvYDcvQRERw?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kvYDcvQRERw\">Watch Nomeansno play Ghosts live in 1991</a>.</figcaption> </figure>   <h2>3. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNJHOgLH5mU\">Big Dick (1989)</a></h2> <p>On one level, NoMeansNo were essentially trying to map the outer limits of what it was possible for a punk rock rhythm section to do. It was something that they were very good at. </p> <h2>4. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppR6LcGnkUY\">Rags and Bones (1989)</a></h2> <p>And of course, now that I\u2019ve got all of that stuff about Wrong off my chest, let me restate \u2013 it is a fantastic album. Rags and Bones is obviously the best face-melting song ever to explore existential crisis with a Moby-Dick reference. And yes, I\u2019m including Mastodon\u2019s Blood and Thunder in that assessment. <br></p> <h2>5. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gnwrLGMxHI\">Kill Everyone Now (1993)</a></h2> <p>It\u2019s just that Wrong isn\u2019t as good as Why Do They Call Me Mr Happy? \u2013 which is the high watermark of all western civilisation. <br></p> <h2>6. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv74G1MDEKE\">It\u2019s Catching Up (live) (1991)</a></h2> <p>NoMeansNo were also one of the greatest live rock bands of all time. You could have gone and watched them yourself. It\u2019s not like they weren\u2019t constantly on tour for 37 years. Luckily for my hyperbolic claims, they did leave behind some convincing evidence in this department in the shape of Live and Cuddly and Live in Warsaw. <br></p> <h2>7.<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIbZLOmGQSA\"> I Can\u2019t Stop Talking (1998)</a></h2> <p>As always when it comes to lyrical content, you can just ignore it if you like. NoMeansNo function just brilliantly as an exciting, whacked-out punk group with lots of gnarly sounding phrases to shout along with after a few beers if that\u2019s your thing. (I\u2019m not throwing shade \u2013 this is how I came to the group initially.) It\u2019s just that lyrically they were several cuts above most of their peers. Punk is/was not short of very bright people, but in a genre where the minimum entry level is Poundland nihilism and angry sloganeering, few come close to Rob Wright\u2019s ability to illuminate subjects such as body horror, existential crisis, antinatalism, the equal failures of religion, democracy and liberal humanism, the oppressiveness of machismo and the absence of free will with such lucidity and breathtaking poetry. It\u2019s more usual to see this kind of subject matter being discussed in the writing of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/03/what-scares-the-new-atheists\">John Gray</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/sep/06/michel-houellebecq-submission-am-i-islamophobic-probably-yes\">Michel Houellebecq</a> and <a href=\"http://www.zero-books.net/books/in-the-dust-of-this-planet\">Eugene Thacker</a> than in punk lyrics; and Wright\u2019s tactic of using \u201clowbrow\u201d, pop-cultural references to illuminate profound philosophical concepts is reminiscent of the writing of Kurt Vonnegut. (1995\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGK_iohptw0\">The Worldhood of the World</a> may not be the only punk album that\u2019s directly inspired by the writing of Martin Heidegger but it\u2019s the only one I can think of off the top of my head.) Their choice of band name, an anti-date-rape slogan, was and remains at best deeply unpleasant, but I don\u2019t believe it\u2019s shock-for-shock\u2019s-sake or misogynist in intention. Instead, to me, it reflects an ongoing interest in the treachery of language itself. You can hear them still railing against the problems of communication on I Can\u2019t Stop Talking, a minimalist pop-punk banger from <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtZtNlfBsvM\">Dance of the Headless Bourgeoisie</a>, released two decades into their career. The lyrics to this track \u2013 and this applies to most of their songs \u2013 really deserve to be read on their own. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"NoMeansNo\">  <iframe src=\"https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify%3Aalbum%3A7n9Sb5zcrT5Stiy8R8eSgo\" width=\"300\" height=\"380\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\"></iframe> </figure>  <h2>8. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWYfQvC_DbU\">Bitches Brew (2000)</a></h2> <p>The brass balls of it. Covering the title track of Miles Davis\u2019s most celebrated (among heavy rock fans at least) album, Bitches Brew. It\u2019s an epic but doomy punk rock affair played live by a three-piece (augmented by guests on Fender Rhodes and congas) but still thrillingly analogous to the original. As always with NMN, there\u2019s a twist \u2013 the track has been reimagined as a piece of gritty American noir, with the dark, disturbing imagistic lyrics calling to mind Dashiell Hammett and James Ellroy. Covering electric jazz fusion standards might not be everyone\u2019s idea of fun, but Miles Davis was adored by all the smartest punk rockers from Henry Rollins to Penny Rimbaud. I mean, just check<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrjFtbGKqFk\"> Rated X</a> from 1974, which is practically the blueprint for Public Image Ltd\u2019s best albums. </p> <h2>9. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVvn0h93uQw\">Dark Ages (Shackleton\u2019s My Goal Beyond Mix) (2012)</a></h2> <p>Because he is a forward-thinking and phenomenal bass player, Rob Wright\u2019s interest in dubstep over the last decade is easy enough to understand. Despite temporarily overlooking the group\u2019s biggest musical asset \u2013 John Wright\u2019s drumming \u2013 the Butchering the Sacred Cows EP from 2012 was a complete success and saw them go out, in terms of recorded output, on a high. It works so well because the interest is clearly not a passing whim, as the well-judged assemblage of remixers \u2013 Shackleton, Orphx, Miles and Deadbeat \u2013 suggests. Even if you don\u2019t own this EP, anyone who has seen NMN over recent years will know Deadbeat\u2019s Power and Glory <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/NoMeansNo/_/The+River+(Deadbeat's+Power+And+Glory+Mix)\">mix of The River</a>, as it was often a set opener. I think it\u2019s fair to say that the reason for this late-stage departure was a mixture of genuine passion and gentle trolling of their own fans. But of course, if you think of punk rock as being a certain kind of spirit or approach to art and life, rather than a restrictive set of codified genre rules, then this was a very punk rock thing to do indeed. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <h2>10. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xbNthA7Uplc\">Cats, Sex and Nazis (1993)</a></h2> <p>I don\u2019t love this song because it baits the steadfastly mediocre Faith No More (\u201cWe care a lot!\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re a liar!\u201d). I don\u2019t love this song for its boozy, raging, lolloping riffs. I don\u2019t love this song for its unsurpassed levels of balefulness, scorn, intransigence, intolerance and sarcasm. I love this song because somehow it seems to nail everything that is wrong with the internet, despite being released in 1993. While probably talking about problems with the media in general \u2013 the patronising but entirely provable idea that a lot of people are happy with the papers/TV as long as they are provided with fluffy animals, titillation and stories on political extremism \u2013 it really seems to have double the relevance now when you think about it. \u201cWhy do they call me Mr Happy?\u201d asks Rob Wright during the closing seconds of this song. It\u2019s a rhetorical question. He\u2019s more than happy to tell you: \u201cIt\u2019s because I\u2019m so \u2026 fucking \u2026 smart.\u201d Too true, sir, too true. But NoMeansNo were perhaps ultimately too smart for their own good as well, unfortunately.</p>",
  "<p>Virtual reality (VR) has finally come of age and a diverse array of new businesses have recently set up to capitalise on this rapidly expanding market. From \u2018beer goggles\u2019 that aim to improve the experience of having a pint, to an app that lets medical students \u2018sit-in\u2019 on operations, entrepreneurs are exploring the possibilities VR presents.</p> <p>Forecasts from <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www2.deloitte.com/global/en/pages/technology-media-and-telecommunications/articles/tmt-pred16-media-virtual-reality-billion-dollar-niche.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Deloitte</a> suggest that 2016 will be VR\u2019s \u201cfirst billion dollar\u201d year, with hardware sales hitting $700m and the remainder coming from content. </p> <p>A recent <a href=\"http://pwc.blogs.com/press_room/2016/07/separating-signal-from-noise-in-emerging-technology.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">report</a> by PWC described it as one of the eight technological \u2018megatrends\u2019, which all businesses should be aware of. Forecasts suggest the global VR market could be worth as much as \u00a323bn by 2020. </p> <p>Across the UK, VR studios are popping up, both to service the needs of big clients and to create their own consumer-facing products. We spoke to four small companies innovating in this space.</p> <h2>Pubs</h2> <p>Experiments between the virtual and real worlds have only just begun, but it was only a matter of time before VR made it to the pub. Scottish craft brewing company <a href=\"http://innisandgunn.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Innis and Gunn</a> brought headsets into bars in London and Scotland to see how it could enhance drinkers\u2019 experiences. The \u00a311.8m business worked with cognitive neuroscientist, Dr. Jacob Jolij, to create some short VR films designed to enhance the pleasure of drinking beer to create an experience it calls \u201cBeer Goggles\u201d. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPKfB2iIT0A\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/oPKfB2iIT0A?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Video from Innis and Gunn.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Drinkers at the selected bars could gaze at forests in the highlands, open waters and sunsets while drinking beer, which the brewer hoped would be a memorable experience. \u201cWhen you sip a beer you don\u2019t simply taste the water, grains and the hops, your brain adds in previous memories, surroundings and expectations to the flavour \u2013 it\u2019s why taste is always somewhat subjective,\u201d says company founder and head brewer Dougal Sharp. \u201cIt\u2019s these brain processes that we wanted to tap into, we wanted to immerse the drinker in a truly unique tasting experience.\u201d<br></p> <p>But does it make beer taste better? \u201cFrom speaking to many people who have experienced it, I\u2019d say most go in sceptical and leave surprised and impressed,\u201d says Sharp.</p> <h2>Virtual surgery</h2> <p>The breadth of possibilities VR offers are just being realised, but for surgeon and entrepreneur Shafi Ahmed, co-founder of <a href=\"http://www.medicalrealities.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Medical Realities</a>, which he launched with Steve Dann earlier this year, the potential to improve training in the medical sector using technology is huge. </p> <p>\u201cSurgical teaching and training hasn\u2019t really evolved very much over the past 100 years,\u201d says Ahmed. \u201cWe\u2019ve always taught surgery in the operating theatre, where students and trainers are often at the back of the room and not always being part of the action.\u201d </p> <p>In April this year, Ahmed performed an operation removing a cancerous tumour from a 70-year-old patient at the Royal London Hospital. What made this procedure extraordinary was that it was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/apr/14/watch-the-worlds-first-virtual-reality-view-operation-live\">live-streamed</a> to over 45,000 people worldwide, who watched it through VR headsets. Formal consent was given by the patient, and steps were taken to ensure they remained anonymous. </p> <p>Ahmed now wants to scale up this kind of experience and, later this year, will launch an app enabling medical students to virtually sit-in on operations.</p> <p>The business, which has eight staff, is also working with universities to create learning suites where student doctors can train with VR. Ahmed says this could rapidly speed up the time it takes to train surgeons.</p> <h2>Fashion</h2> <p>Enabling people to enter hard-to-reach or unexplored realms is the aim of startup <a href=\"http://www.curiscope.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Curiscope</a>. Earlier this year, the business raised \u00a382,000 in a <a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/curiscope/virtualitee\" rel=\"nofollow\">crowdfunding campaign</a> for the Virtuali-Tee, an augmented reality t-shirt that lets you see inside the human body via a mobile phone app. </p> <p>The app locates a code hidden in the design of the t-shirt and then shows the user an image of internal organs (where they would be located on the t-shirt\u2019s wearer) when looked at through the mobile\u2019s screen. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5d1c835bac2c550c02273cb15fe14987b355cd1e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5d1c835bac2c550c02273cb15fe14987b355cd1e/0_128_2048_1229/1000.jpg\" alt=\"t-shirt and mobile app\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Virtuali-Tee.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: curiscope virtualti</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Ed Barton, CEO of Curiscope, says: \u201cThe app is looking for the specific design that\u2019s on the t-shirt. When it finds that, it is able to interpret where the t-shirt is and where you are in 3D space, allowing you to navigate and explore,\u201d says Barton. </p> <p>The business has several other projects on the go, including a virtual swim with great white sharks. Barton says: \u201cThe majority of people can\u2019t jump on a plane whenever they\u2019d like, we can\u2019t learn scuba diving in an instant and dive to the bottom of the ocean, we can\u2019t all become astronauts and go into space. VR opens up these inaccessible worlds, sometimes even impossible worlds, like being at a microscopic level.\u201d </p> <h2>Entertainment</h2> <p>While some entrepreneurs want to educate, others hope to entertain. Ken Henderson is the co-founder of <a href=\"http://www.breakingfourth.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Breaking Fourth</a>, a VR studio in London. The company recently launched a new VR drama called control CTRL \u2013 a dark, dystopian tale of a young boy trying to succeed in a video games tournament \u2013 on Oculus.com (a virtual reality headset maker) where it can be downloaded by users.</p> <p>Henderson says cheaper headsets and \u2018mobile VR\u2019, where simulations can be powered by mobile phones, is leading to a surge in usage. However, he says the industry lacks content and he is hoping to take advantage. \u201cWe\u2019ve jumped ahead and are trying to be in the forefront of that,\u201d says Henderson. To make CTRL, Breaking Fourth hired actors, screenwriters and other creatives, suggesting that VR could provide the UK\u2019s creative industries with a much needed boost. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8643f45a12d8d285bbdeb9c03051cd242f6d4c70\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8643f45a12d8d285bbdeb9c03051cd242f6d4c70/0_256_1380_1725/800.jpg\" alt=\"man wearing mask\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A promotional shot from In the eyes of the animal, one of the VR experiences at the Brighton Digital Festival.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Brighton Digital Festival</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The film was also recently shown at the <a href=\"http://brightondigitalfestival.co.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Brighton Digital Festival</a>, which had a strong VR focus this year.

These 2003 agreements appear not to have broken Lao or international law, which came into effect soon afterwards.

Finally, in January 2014, the Lao government revoked his licence to trade wildlife. By that time, however, the Lao prime minister\u2019s office had silently snubbed the international community by signing off on more agreements to help two other companies replace him.<br></p> <p>The Guardian has had access to compelling evidence that in December 2013 the then Lao prime minister\u2019s office ordered four government ministries and two provincial governors to help these companies traffic wildlife with huge annual quotas. The agreements were worth a fortune \u2013 up to $30m in a single month for one company \u2013 with the government once again taking its 2%. Unlike the original deal with Keosavang, these agreements specifically sanctioned the sale of the three iconic species that are closest to extinction as a result of this trade: tigers, rhinos and elephants.

This included 20 tonnes of ivory, valued at $5m \u2013 a straightforward breach of international law. <a href=\"https://eia-international.org/\">The Environmental Investigation Agency</a> in London estimates that one elephant yields an average of 6.7kg of ivory, meaning that the Lao government that year was allowing Vinasakhone to trade on the criminal death of 2,985 dead elephants. The quotas also included 10 tonnes of lion bone, which is used in tonic wine; and 1,300 tonnes of live turtles, snakes, lizards and pangolin ant-eaters whose scales are used in traditional medicine \u2013 all of it potentially illegal by breaching CITES quotas.<br></p> <p>The other company, Vannaseng Trading, was authorised to traffic even more. In ivory alone, according to our evidence, the government agreed that during 2014 they could traffic 90 tonnes of ivory with an estimated value of $22.5m. That equates to 13,432 elephants lying dead in the African bush; also 4 tonnes of rhino horn that was valued at only $240,000; and 20 tonnes of tiger skin and bone and claws worth $1.2m. All of that trade in all three of those species is illegal.<br></p> <p>Also agreed was potentially illegal trade in live turtles, water monitors, pangolins and exotic birds; 6 tonnes of python skin and 120 tonnes of dead and frozen pangolin. The total package agreed with Vannaseng for 2014 was worth $28.2m \u2013 all to be officially taxed at 2% for the government\u2019s treasury.<br></p> <p>Both Vinaskhone and Vannaseng have a track record of wildlife crime.

At least some of that trade must have been illegal. All international trade in tiger bone is illegal under Cites; trade in lion bone is allowed only if it is covered by Cites permits. Even if the entire 7.7 tonnes was lion bone, at an average weight of 10kg per skeleton that would represent 770 dead lions. But Cites records show that during the whole calendar year of 2014, Laos had permits to import the skeletons of only 360 lions.</p> <p>If there was any doubt, the inspector\u2019s report explicitly accused both farms of breaching Cites by importing and exporting endangered species without having any paperwork to show that it was within legal limits. Crucially, the inspectors added that the law could not be enforced against them \u201cbecause they have got approval from government\u201d.<br></p> <p>In March this year, inspectors from the Ministry of Natural Resources went to the farm run by Vinasakhone since 2002 near the town of Thakek in central Laos. According to the report, seen by the Guardian, the farm, which houses about 400 tigers in pens, is involved in speed-breeding \u2013 using females as young as two years old to produce cubs twice each year. The inspectors note that this is regarded as bad practice. But their report goes on to make a much more serious allegation: that Vinasakhone has been killing its tigers to order for sale to Vietnam and China \u2013 a brazen breach of the law.<br></p> <p>The report says: \u201cTraders usually come to the farm to select the animal they want, take pictures and record an identity. The selection is whether that animal is pretty, pretty teeth, paws and tail, basically no scar on its body. The animal is killed at the farm by injection, all intestines are removed so they keep only the body with skin, bones and meat, covered with plastic sheet for shipment.\u201d<br></p> <p>The report adds that Vinasakhone managers admitted selling a hundred tigers to the notorious Golden Triangle on Laos\u2019s borders with Myanmar and Thailand. A 2015 investigation by the Environmental Investigation Agency described this area as \u201ca playground catering to the desires of visiting Chinese\u201d where \u201ca combination of weak laws, poor enforcement and official complicity allows the illegal wildlife trade to flourish\u201d. The EIA found traders openly selling tiger skins and stuffed tigers while restaurants sold bottles of tiger bone wine and \u201dsauteed tiger meat\u201d. All are illegal.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b4983edcd9c44610cc76fb8699e9fe54e9985785\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b4983edcd9c44610cc76fb8699e9fe54e9985785/0_399_5284_3170/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A female tiger and her cubs.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A female tiger and her cubs.

This echoed a 2010 report by the the British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection, which published emails in which the manager of the farm said that the business had been started with monkeys caught in the wild in Cambodia and smuggled into Laos, adding that he was planning to apparently break the law again by bringing in more wild monkeys in the near future.<br></p> <p>Laos remains a full member of Cites, although it was briefly suspended early in 2015 for failing to to deliver a national plan to deal with the ivory trade.

  "<p>China has been accused of deceiving the international community by allowing a network of farms to breed thousands of captive tigers for the sale of their body parts, in breach of their own longstanding ban on the trade.<br></p> <p>The Chinese government has allowed about 200 specialist farms to hold an estimated 6,000 tigers for slaughter, before their skins are sold as decoration and their bones are marinated to produce tonics and lotions.

The SFA claimed that the skins were only sold to museums and universities for scientific purposes, but the EIA found at least half ended up in the plush apartments of China\u2019s elite.<br></p> <p>Facing exposure, the Chinese disclosed that the wording of the State Council\u2019s 1993 ban had been much narrower than its public statements had suggested, and that it applied only to trade in products produced from tiger bones, primarily wine. But, as animal rights campaigners dug deeper, it soon became clear that the SFA were also licensing the sale of tiger bone products. And the profits were huge. The wildlife-tracking NGO Traffic found tiger bone wine selling at $257 for 500ml, while another group, the International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW), found one farm alone had a cellar full of vats containing 1.2 million litres, worth an estimated $617m. Wine from marinated tiger penis was even more expensive, at $490 per 500ml. Meat was being sold at $100 a dish; teeth at $660 each; and whole skins for up to $22,000.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/26/bach-brothers-elephant-ivory-asias-animal-trafficking-network\">The crime family at the centre of Asia's animal trafficking network</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Inspired by China\u2019s behaviour, Thailand, Vietnam and Laos also opened tiger farms, some of which were suspected to be not only breeding animals for body parts but also \u201claundering\u201d wild tigers that had been captured.

When 13 heads of government met for the Global Tiger Initiative in St Petersburg in November 2010, the then Chinese premier, Wen Jiabao, called for an end to the tiger trade, yet his delegates joined with those from Thailand, Vietnam and Laos to ensure that the meeting\u2019s final declaration was worded to allow their farms to continue trading.<br></p> <p>The effect has been devastating. An analysis by the EIA found that in the 12 years from 2000, law enforcement agencies seized 1,031 tiger carcasses or skins \u2013 90% of which were en route to China. Working on the standard police estimate that just 10% of illicit trade is seized, then somewhere in the region of 10,000 tigers were killed primarily for China\u2019s consumers in this period.<br></p> <p>In the buildup to this month\u2019s Cites conference in Johannesburg \u2013 and in spite of its track record \u2013 China took over the chairmanship of the working group on big cats, and used its position to water down the findings of a report that Cites had commissioned from the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).<br></p> <p>The report, seen by the Guardian, embarrassed China by finding that they had \u201csystematically exercised internal trading privileges for companies dealing in big cat skins and derivatives, produced mainly from captive breeding\u201d.

The rise of Thatcher\u2019s New Right, trade union defeats, globalisation and the end of the cold war \u2013 which was spun as the death of any alternative to free market capitalism \u2013 reduced the left to a defensive posture, committed more to defending existing gains than offering a coherent alternative.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/26/john-mcdonnell-10-an-hour-living-wage-plan-labour-conference\">John McDonnell announces \u00a310 an hour living wage plan</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Yesterday\u2019s speech by Labour\u2019s shadow chancellor John McDonnell was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/26/john-mcdonnell-10-an-hour-living-wage-plan-labour-conference\" title=\"\">a bold corrective</a>. Yes, there was a damning indictment of the Tories\u2019 economic failures: the failure to eliminate the deficit as promised, a rising national debt, lagging productivity, stagnating living standards, precarious jobs and the national scandal of child poverty in one of the richest societies that has ever existed. But rather than simply chin-stroking and finger-wagging at the Tories, here was an attempt to actually say what Labour would do. Red lines on Brexit \u2013 like access to the single market while addressing people\u2019s concerns about \u201cthe undercutting of wages and conditions\u201d \u2013 were drawn.

How on earth do these speeches address those concerns? There are two points to make. Firstly, Labour\u2019s failure to defend Blair and Brown\u2019s spending record \u2013 with the Tories revising history to claim that the investment they backed was at the root of Britain\u2019s economic woes \u2013 is critical to understanding the party\u2019s election loss.

Voters were told that if they voted to leave the European Union, economic disaster awaited. Big businesses lined up to warn of the terrible economic consequences. More than half the British electorate marched to polling booths and voted to leave anyway. Why? They were inspired by a vision (one I rejected) that trumped their worries about the economy. That\u2019s Labour\u2019s task today. Big businesses are again lining up to denounce the party\u2019s plans, but they are not trusted by the public. The main challenge \u2013 not yet addressed \u2013 is to present Labour\u2019s vision in a clear, easily digestible format that resonates with voters. Only sad politicos like me bother to watch long speeches: how can it be presented in a way that inspires the electorate, as \u201ctake back control\u201d undoubtedly did during the referendum campaign?</p> <p>Labour\u2019s obstacles are formidable. The party\u2019s <a href=\"https://yougov.co.uk/news/2016/09/23/corbyn-vs-may/\" title=\"\">polling is catastrophic</a>, it is self-evidently divided, and its leadership has yet to find its feet in communicating its message amid <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/20/momentum-media-bias-channel4-dispatches\" title=\"\">such a hostile media</a>. Yet while Labour\u2019s divisions are well documented, on the economy \u2013 and other <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/14/corbyn-lambasts-may-on-grammar-schools-in-boisterous-pmqs\" title=\"\">key issues</a> \u2013 there is a striking amount of unity. The odds are of course stacked against Labour succeeding. But after a torrid few months, this determined effort to sketch out a new economy offers hope, and it should be seized upon.</p>",

As a way of addressing climate change, offsetting flying against the carbon stored in forests would be insane,\u201d says Chris Lang, editor of <a href=\"http://www.redd-monitor.org/\">Redd Monitor</a> which has analysed <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/dec/19/what-is-redd-climate-change-deforestation\">UN proposals to reduce forestry emissions with a similar offset scheme</a>. </p> <p>\u201cNot only would such a scheme allow the aviation sector to continue expanding and to continue burning fossil fuels, it would rely on carbon being stored in forests. Yet as climate change worsens, the risk of these forests burning and returning the carbon to the atmosphere is increasing,\u201d he said.</p> <p> The offsetting scheme, which hopes to stabilise aviation emissions at 2020 levels, is strongly defended by Michael Gill, director of the Aviation Transport Action Group (ATAG), an industry coalition. </p> <p> \u201cOffsetting is not a new concept,\u201d he says. \u201cIndeed, a large number of airlines already offer offsetting to passengers on a voluntary basis. What the industry does need is certainty, with a clear set of metrics defined before the scheme commences and consistently applied throughout its lifetime.\u201d</p> <p>Alexandre de Juniac, director general of the International Air Transport Association (Iata), said: \u201cI am optimistic that we are on the brink of a historic agreement\u2014a first for an industry sector at the global level. The aviation industry would have preferred a more ambitious timeline than is currently outlined.\u201d </p> <p>Critics are not convinced. The International Coalition for Sustainable Aviation (ICSA), the only civil society body accredited to observe the aviation proceedings, has strong reservations about the proposed market-based scheme because it would rely on a system of \u201cvoluntary, unguaranteed participation with weak environmental safeguards\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe new proposed text would allow nations participating ... to opt out with only six months\u2019 notice, raising serious concerns about the durability of the programme,\u201d said the ICSA in <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://uploads.strikinglycdn.com/files/afc9650e-aaeb-4741-a329-ebcc983e7280/ISCA%20Statement%209.7%20(3).pdf\">a letter to EU commissioners</a>. </p> <p>The coalition also fears that if the offsets used to achieve the goal of the UN scheme are also credited to other climate goals, emissions will increase while countries and airlines appear to meet their pledges. </p> <p>Instead they want to see ambitious states and regions allowed to go further in reducing their emissions and clear language introduced to avoid double counting.</p> <p>The environmental coalition prefers an expansion of the EU emissions trading system (ETS), which controversially <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/may/15/eu-airline-emissions-tax-success\">included aviation for 10 months in 2012</a>. The scheme involved the EU imposing a cap on carbon dioxide emissions for all planes arriving or departing from EU airports, while allowing airlines to buy and sell \u201cpollution credits\u201d , rewarding low carbon-emitting aviation. </p> <p>But <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/nov/12/eu-airline-emissions-law\">the EU froze the scheme in November 2012</a> after the ICAO said it would take global action on emissions from planes. </p> <p>\u201cThe EU stopped the clock on its own ETS to give ICAO time to develop an environmentally meaningful measure, not a voluntary scheme which postpones serious action for a decade or more. Europe should be proud of setting the global benchmark, and never replace it with something inferior that is open to bogus offset programmes,\u201d said Andrew Murphy, aviation policy officer at Transport &amp; Environment.</p> <p><br tabindex=\"-1\"></p>",
  "<p>A talking cat. A giant flan. Truth sprinkles. Sabrina the Teenage Witch was irreverent and absurd, yes, but its feminist ethos and screwball-esque dialogue made it stand out from the average teen show of its day. </p> <p>Which is why, 20 years on, it still resonates.

Scovell co-wrote Sheryl Sandberg\u2019s 2013 bestselling ode to the power of female negotiation. And it was but one job in a broad (to put it mildly) career. The first staff writer at Spy magazine, she got into television via a script she sent on spec to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2016/mar/24/garry-shandling-comedy-sitcom-legacy\">It\u2019s Garry Shandling\u2019s Show</a>.

Today, Scovell views her career trajectory as utterly unsurprising. \u201cIt makes total sense to me,\u201d she says. \u201cSabrina was my attempt to create a show that I would\u2019ve loved as that weird young girl who grew up to write for Letterman and Spy and The Simpsons.\u201d</p> <p>The show lives on through syndication, exposing a new generation of teens to its unique, undeniable charm. When asked to explain the show\u2019s continued appeal to smart, weird, girls and boys, Scovell says: \u201cIt was unusual to have a girl as the star, so that was empowering. And the stories weren\u2019t cookie-cutter, either. In one of my favorite episodes, Sabrina wanted to know if [her best friend] Harvey liked her as more than a friend so she put \u2018truth sprinkles\u2019 on his bundt cake in home ec class. But the teacher ended up putting them on all the cakes and, for a day, everyone at school told each other what they really think. Sabrina came home and told her aunts that the lesson was that the world would be an awful place if everyone told the truth all the time.\u201d <br></p> <p>Scovell laughs. \u201cI bet no TGIF show ever landed on that moral before.\u201d And chances are, it never will again.<br></p>",

  "<p>The issue of how climate change is affecting coffee production hit the headlines recently after the publication of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/29/climate-change-predicted-to-halve-coffee-growing-area-that-supports-120m-people\">new report</a> from the Climate Institute, which claims climate change will halve the area suitable for coffee production by 2050.</p> <p>While companies may once have diversified their suppliers in the face of supply risk, the systematic impact of climate change across coffee-growing regions requires a radical rethink of production models and sourcing relationships, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2015/may/11/coffee-supply-chain-arabica-climate-change-business-model\">according to</a> Alejandro Litovsky, the founder and CEO of the Earth Security Group.</p> <p>This inevitably affects the more than 120 million of the world\u2019s poorest people who rely on the coffee supply chain for their livelihoods. With this in mind, we brought together four experts <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/live/2016/sep/16/coffee-climate-change-smallholders-central-america-ethiopia-technology-funding\">to debate</a> how coffee, and those who produce it, can be supported.</p> <p>Here\u2019s what you need to know:</p> <h2>1. Climate change is already causing problems </h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It is threatening the livelihoods of producers we work with. We see the impact, they are producing less.</p> </blockquote> <p>These are the words of Steven Macatonia, co-founder of Union Hand-Roasted Coffee, who said that changing weather patterns such as erratic rainfall, increased temperatures, and more pests and disease are having a negative effect on the volume and quality of coffee produced.</p> <p>Aaron Davis, senior research leader of plant resources at Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, said that while some of the more recently published work on coffee and climate change is probably too pessimistic, it is very clear that coffee farming worldwide is being negatively influenced by climate change.</p> <h2>2. The effects will be far reaching</h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Climate change is happening already but its impacts will not be distributed equally.<br></p> </blockquote> <p>Emma Pinchbeck, head of climate and energy policy at WWF, said that as climate change worsens it is poor communities who bear the brunt of the impacts, especially if they\u2019re dependent for their income on natural resources such as coffee. A quarter of Ethiopians make a living from growing coffee, for example.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2015/may/11/coffee-supply-chain-arabica-climate-change-business-model\">Your morning espresso could be about to get a lot more expensive</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Pinchbeck also pointed out that the impact on coffee drinkers will be a useful reminder that climate change\u2019s impacts won\u2019t be restricted to developing countries.</p> <h2>3. There are steps coffee growers can take </h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>A useful first step is to understand your local and regional climate, in order to work out the level of risk </p> </blockquote> <p>That\u2019s the advice from Davis, who added this can be done by investing in simple climatic monitoring equipment, which can be used to assess the performance of each season\u2019s crop in relation to climatic variables and the long-term climatic averages. This gives farmers a better understanding of where they are on the scale of risk, and what adaptation measures need to be implemented, said Davis. </p> <p>The most obvious interventions are irrigation, shade management and mulching, but terracing also has clear benefits. Shifting to another coffee species (for example, from Arabica to Robusta), or using more drought resilient cultivars of existing species, may also be an option.</p> <h2>4. Farmers need protection from financial instability</h2> <p>Hugo Villela, regional agribusiness specialist at Oikocredit, pointed out that as well as the problem of smallholder coffee producers being exposed to increased price volatility as a result of climate change, there is also the issue of long-term investors withdrawing their investments if they deem coffee too risky.</p> <p>Fairtrade is one solution, said Villela, as the certification provides a minimum price which buffers some of the effects of price volatility caused by the impact of weather on crop supply. But only a small portion of coffee producers can access this benefit, he said, since not all coffee producers hold a Fairtrade certificate.</p> <p>The increased challenges faced by farmers requires them to improve their commercial skills in order to buffer the blows. For example, said Villela, they will need better stock control, improved price risk management incorporating more varied financing options, tighter controls over their business commitments, and to adopt more long-term, diversified approaches to their small-holdings.<br></p> <h2>5. New technology won\u2019t solve everything</h2> <p>The technical ability to understand how climate change will influence each coffee growing area now exists, said Davis. Much of this work relies on modern technology, such as remote sensing \u2013 the use of satellite data \u2013 and advanced computer modelling.</p> <p>But not all farmers will be able to afford this technology, said Davis, and it is not a complete cure:<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It is clear that for many farmers even the most sophisticated adaptation interventions will not ensure resilience against climate change and climatic perturbations. </p> </blockquote> <p> </p> <ul> <li><strong>Read the full live chat here: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/live/2016/sep/16/coffee-climate-change-smallholders-central-america-ethiopia-technology-funding\">Climate change is threatening the world\u2019s coffee supplies: what can we do?</a></strong><br></li> </ul>",

She demanded explanations over his tax returns, his treatment of workers, his temperament as the man with his finger on the nuclear trigger. As he ducked and dived with incoherent excuses, she stared at him with thinly veiled contempt.</p> <p>Then, right at the end, like a long-suffering, frosty school principal, she decided to expel the ranting, sniffling, whining 70-year-old schoolboy who had not done his homework. </p> <p>Trump had said she did not have the stamina to be president. Icy and deadly, Clinton replied: \u201cWell, as soon as he travels to 112 countries and negotiates a peace deal, a ceasefire, a release of dissidents, an opening of new opportunities in nations around the world or even spends 11 hours testifying in front of a congressional committee, he can talk to me about stamina.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/26/debate-fact-check-trump-clinton-live-quotes-hofstra\">Presidential debate fact-check: a review of Trump's and Clinton's claims</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Elsewhere, the first female candidate to participate in a US presidential debate pointed to the Republican nominee\u2019s past derogatory comments toward women, invoking Alicia Machado<em tabindex=\"-1\">,</em> a beauty pageant contestant he had called \u201cMs Piggy\u201d and \u201cMs Housekeeping\u201d. Clinton said: \u201cDonald, she has a name.\u201d</p> <p>This was not the courtly jousting of Kennedy v Nixon in 1960 \u2013 although Clinton constantly addressed her opponent as Donald. \u201cHow are you, Donald?\u201d she asked when they first shook hands. \u201cDonald, it\u2019s good to be with you,\u201d she said. And then, as the mood quickly soured: \u201cI\u2019ve met a lot of people who were stiffed by you and your businesses, Donald.\u201d</p> <p>Trump nearly always called his Democratic rival Secretary Clinton. At the outset he checked: \u201cIs that OK? I want you to be very happy.\u201d But the politeness very quickly faded as he interrupted, heckled, rolled his eyes and tried to throw the authority figure off her game with lies. She missed some opportunities to capitalise as she stared at him with thinly veiled contempt.</p> <p>The debate of the century at Hofstra University on Long Island, New York, began with Clinton and Trump striding out on a deep blue stage with white stars and a giant seal: the American eagle with an olive branch, a bunch of arrows and the words: \u201cThe union and the constitution forever.\u201d</p> <p>The nation that brought you Batman v Superman and Captain America v Iron Man held its breath for Mrs Know It All v Mr Know Nothing.</p> <p>Clinton said the central question of the election is what kind of country the US wanted to be: \u201cToday is my granddaughter\u2019s second birthday, so I think about this a lot.\u201d Trump, the former host of The Apprentice, narrowed his eyes, tightened his mouth and stared at the camera, as if trying to plant in the audience\u2019s mind the familiar phrase: \u201cYou\u2019re fired.\u201d</p> <p>But the gloves soon came off. Trump gripped both sides of the lectern, his face grew angry, his voice rose aggressively. There were a series of bitter exchanges that showed the genuine animosity between the two and made for the guilty pleasure of compelling television.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"caee63985a9b47adb673a74a037aa2f467215450\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/caee63985a9b47adb673a74a037aa2f467215450/0_233_4931_2960/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Trump speaks as Clinton listens during the debate at Hofstra University Monday.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Trump speaks as Clinton listens during the debate at Hofstra University on Monday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pool/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Clinton said Trump had rooted for the housing crisis so he could make money. He couldn\u2019t resist interjecting: \u201cThat\u2019s called business, by the way.\u201d </p> <p>The Republican\u2019s best moment came over trade, his strongest suit in the election campaign. Clinton parried: \u201cI think my husband did a pretty good job in the 1990s. I think a lot about what worked and how we can make it work again \u2026\u201d</p> <p>Trump barged in: \u201cWell, he approved Nafta.\u201d</p> <p>Tension mounted as the candidates talked over each other, making prime minister\u2019s questions in Britain look positively tame.</p> <p>Trump repeated: \u201cHe approved Nafta, which is the single worst trade deal ever approved in this country.\u201d</p> <p>Trump claimed that Clinton supported the Trans Pacific Partnership with Asia then changed her mind. But she shot back with a line that could sum up the entire election for the celebrity businessman: \u201cWell, Donald, I know you live in your own reality.\u201d</p> <p>Much of the night felt like that. As if to prove the point, Trump told Clinton later: \u201cYou\u2019ve been fighting Isis your entire adult life.\u201d</p> <p>Even Clinton hardly knew how to respond to that one. \u201cThat\u2019s a \u2013 that\u2019s \u2013 go to the \u2013 please, fact-checkers, get to work.\u201d</p> <p>Later Clinton mused: \u201cI have a feeling that by the end of this evening, I\u2019m going to be blamed for everything that\u2019s ever happened.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d asked Trump.</p> <p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d responded Clinton. \u201cYeah, why not?\u201d</p> <p>The pair also tangled over Trump\u2019s tax returns. Clinton was cutting: \u201cYou\u2019ve got to ask yourself, why won\u2019t he release his tax returns? And I think there may be a couple of reasons. First, maybe he\u2019s not as rich as he says he is. Second, maybe he\u2019s not as charitable as he claims to be. Third, we don\u2019t know all of his business dealings,\u201d she said, adding that he may not have paid any income tax.</p> <p>Trump lobbed in: \u201cThat makes me smart.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/26/trump-sniffles-presidential-debate-clinton-hofstra\">Trump's sniffles distract viewers at first presidential debate with Clinton</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Had the class clown just admitted on live television, before a global audience of tens of millions, that he has not in fact paid income tax? Clinton squandered the opportunity to pin him down on it.</p> <p>He offered to release his tax returns if she released her deleted emails, branding her handling of sensitive information \u201cdisgraceful\u201d. But even much-criticized NBC presenter Matt Lauer, in the recent \u201ccommander-in-chief\u201d forum between the two, had spent longer on the email issue than Trump managed.</p> <p>There was, finally, a more substantial section on race relations. Trump boasted of his travels to speak to African American voters, telling Clinton: \u201cYou\u2019ve seen me, I\u2019ve been all over the place. You decided to stay home and that\u2019s OK.\u201d</p> <p>But Clinton had a zinger up her sleeve: \u201cI think Donald just criticised me for preparing for this debate. And yes, I did. And you know what else I prepared for? I prepared to be president. And I think that\u2019s a good thing.\u201d</p> <p>Trump was asked about his crusade to sow doubts over Barack Obama\u2019s birthplace. He flunked the test and this was the turning point in the debate. \u201cI say nothing because I was able to get him to produce [his birth certificate]. He should have produced it a long time before. I say nothing.\u201d</p> <p>On national security and foreign policy, he was all over the place. Resurrecting one of the best lines from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/29/hillary-clinton-convention-speech-analysis\">her convention speech</a>, Clinton said: \u201cA man who could be provoked with a tweet should not have his finger anywhere near the button.\u201d</p> <p>Trump replied: \u201cThat line is getting a little bit old.\u201d</p> <p>Clinton came back: \u201cIt\u2019s a good one, though. Well describes the problem.\u201d</p> <p>Then, in the bottom of the final round, came the knockout punch over sexism and stamina. It was over. Despite the bad blood, the debate of the century ended as it began, with a handshake and Trump twice patting Clinton on the back. Later he told a TV interviewer that he had shown heroic self-restraint in not mentioning Bill Clinton\u2019s past infidelities out of respect for their daughter Chelsea. So yes, it could have been more childish still.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p>",
  "<p>Nuno Esp\u00edrito Santo was in a terrible state, drunk. That, at least, is what his president thought, and exactly what Nuno wanted him to think. A young goalkeeper at Vit\u00f3ria Guimar\u00e3es, he had been promised that if anyone came in with a $1m offer he could leave, and one day the Spanish club Deportivo La Coru\u00f1a did just that \u2013 only for Ant\u00f3nio Pimenta Machado to renege. \u201cI thought: \u2018It\u2019s done, perfect,\u2019\u201d Nuno says. \u201cBut I went in and he said: \u2018Now it\u2019s five [million].\u2019 I thought: \u2018This doesn\u2019t make sense.\u2019\u201d Denied the chance to leave, he considered giving up. Which was when they hatched a plan.</p> <p>Nuno\u2019s agent messed up his apartment and told Pimenta Machado that the player was in a bad way. \u201cIt was an act,\u201d Nuno recalls, pulling faces as he runs through his repertoire that day, 20 years ago, slumping back in his seat, mumbling and unresponsive. \u201cSo, the guy came to visit me, the president of Vit\u00f3ria, and my behaviour was \u2026 I was acting like I\u2019d come off the streets. And he said: \u2018Is he drunk?\u2019 When he left, the president said: \u2018Take him tomorrow.\u2019\u201d Nuno pauses then adds: \u201c\u2018Take him tomorrow \u2026 and don\u2019t let them do a test on him!\u2019\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/23/claudio-ranieri-danny-drinkwater-leicester-city\">Claudio Ranieri: Danny Drinkwater deal will keep him at Leicester</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The plan worked; the agent\u2019s name was Jorge Mendes. \u201cJorge knew exactly what time [Augusto C\u00e9sar] Lendoiro, the Depor president, left the club every evening,\u201d Nuno says. \u201cHe would leave the office, go downstairs and walk to a restaurant 100 metres away. And Jorge would be there, walking side-by-side. He would drive two-and-a-half hours there from Portugal for 100 metres \u2013 but he knew those 100 metres were golden. Then he would drive two-and-a-half hours back to tell me.\u201d Eventually Mendes got the $1m offer; what he didn\u2019t expect was to have to persuade Vit\u00f3ria\u2019s president twice.</p> <p>In the end, Nuno got the move to Spain. It was the first deal Mendes ever did. Nuno met him when Mendes ran a video shop and a disco; now he is the world\u2019s most powerful football agent. \u201cHe deserves it,\u201d Nuno says. \u201cPeople can\u2019t imagine the hours this guy works. [His reputation] is unfair; they don\u2019t know him.\u201d Mendes\u2019s most famous clients are Cristiano Ronaldo and Jos\u00e9 Mourinho; his first client is now the manager of Porto. On Tuesday night, he faces Leicester City in the Champions League.</p> <p>Nuno\u2019s journey began on the island of Sao Tom\u00e9, and has already taken in Portugal, Spain, Greece and Russia. Scotland, too: as a coach, that\u2019s where it all started. He is still only 42 and believes that one day it will end in England.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s to do with the global vision I have: we\u2019re so connected, [everything is] so fast now. Why not? The first thing I did everywhere was learn the language,\u201d he says, speaking English with a quiet, almost gentle authority. \u201cI think it also has to do with Portugal and with your family. My grandfather is African, my grandmother is from a small village in Portugal. He arrived on a boat \u2013 it was the first time they\u2019d seen a black man. Maybe it starts there; we lived near the Spanish border and my sister and I travelled a lot with our parents.\u201d</p> <p>Nuno crossed the border in January 1997 to play for Deportivo, before going to M\u00e9rida and Osasuna, Dynamo Moscow and Porto. If \u201cplaying\u201d is the right word, that is: at Deportivo he made four league appearances in five years. He went to Euro 2008 with Portugal, replacing Quim, but never won a cap. In his first spell at Porto, he won the Uefa Cup and the Champions League with Mourinho, but did so from the bench.</p> <p>That said, he did replace Vitor Ba\u00eda late in the Intercontinental Cup final and go on to win on penalties. And he scored a penalty in one game. It was Mourinho\u2019s idea. \u201cIt\u2019s strange \u2013 I didn\u2019t want it,\u201d he recalls. No? \u201cNo. I just put the ball down and kick it so hard. Put it down, three steps and bang! It could go there, there, there \u2026\u201d he says, pointing around the room.\u201d Instead, it went in. \u201cThe first thing I did when I scored was hug the other goalkeeper. \u2018I\u2019m sorry. For you this is a big humiliation, so I\u2019m sorry.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Besides, it all helped, even from there. Nuno watched, listened and learned, ideas forming. He took something from everyone. Emotional management from Mourinho, for example. \u201cMourinho really changed something,\u201d Nuno says. \u201cHe said: \u2018We\u2019re going to win\u2019 and we looked at him like: \u2018How can this guy be so sure?\u2019 It\u2019s colossal what he did at Porto. When you achieve something like that it is in your memory forever. What I take from him is that belief that he could create something and show us that we were going to succeed, [even] fighting against giants.\u201d</p> <p>The truism says that goalkeepers don\u2019t make good coaches, so what chance substitute goalkeepers? A good chance, he insists. \u201cYou see the game from the best place. All the analyses I do even now [as coach] are from a camera behind the goal. From the side, the perspective is different, you know the exact distances, but it\u2019s not real,\u201d he says, shifting his hands to signal a goalkeeper\u2019s perspective. \u201cBut this gives you a real view of the game as players see it. A player never experiences the game from the side.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt may not be better but it is my view. I know spaces, distances, and I can judge better the decision-making of the players. I know why this player did not pass to you \u2013 because there was an obstacle in front. From the side [you can think]: \u2018Why didn\u2019t you pass it \u2026?\u2019 but the lines are different,\u201d he says, laughing as he adds: \u201cI also saw a lot of games from the bench. I watched games, I listened to my coaches, and I talked to my team-mates. \u2018Hey, why is he taking off this guy?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>As a coach, he must know that his players are doing the same to him. \u201cYeah,\u201d Nuno smiles. \u201cOr the other way round: I can turn to them and say: \u2018Shut up, I know what I\u2019m doing, OK?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>The decision to coach took him to Scotland at the age of 36. He took his coaching badges with the Scottish Football Association.</p> <p>\u201cThey did something I still use,\u201d he recalls. \u201cYou know how every meeting starts at the SFA? With a video. The best 50 goals from the 1980s: John Barnes, Ian Rush \u2026 and for three or four minutes afterwards everyone is quiet because you get hypnotised. And it was day after day: the best saves, the best one-on-ones, the best shots. I thought: \u2018This is brilliant.\u2019</p> <p>\u201cI went to a meeting: \u2018Shhh, do you mind?\u2019 Normally a meeting starts and everyone is talking. This way, it was focused, quiet. And after the video \u2026\u201d Nuno clicks his fingers. \u201cYou start and everyone is listening. It\u2019s like opening a window. These guys knew what they were doing. I met so many good people: Jim Fleeting, Donald Park, so many people. They were a big influence on me.\u201d</p> <p>None more so than Ian Cathro, the young, dynamic Scottish coach who was Nuno\u2019s assistant at Rio Ave, where they were runners up in both Portuguese cups in 2013-14, and at Valencia \u2013 where they reached the Champions League places in 2014-15, before Nuno was sacked early in the following season, only for things to get <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/mar/30/gary-neville-leaves-valencia-immediate-effect\">far worse under his replacements, Gary Neville </a>and then Pako Ayestar\u00e1n.</p> <p>Nuno has called Cathro a \u201cgenius\u201d; now he is assistant to Rafa Ben\u00edtez at Newcastle. \u201cWe will be connected forever,\u201d Nuno says. \u201cWe built together. We were young, we started together, we did something nobody believed in. Now Rio Ave are in Europe. If I ever went to the Premier League he would be my first call, the first person I would tell. We have shared so much.\u201d</p> <p>And Nuno thinks that day will come, too. \u201c[England] is the league that I enjoy most. I love watching the Premier League. One day I am going to coach there, I am sure of it. I love it, I want to be there. If it takes longer, I don\u2019t know. If it takes less, maybe. But one day.\u201d As Nuno talks through his ideas, the influences are clear, the impact of British football. \u201cAs a kid, Liverpool was big for us [in Portugal],\u201d he says. \u201cI watched all the Wembley cup finals. [Neville] Southall with the big belly, the goalie: \u2018How can this guy stop \u2026 I can do that.\u2019 [Bruce] Grobbelaar, too.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"81d82c1b9e341311aaf8a04a3edbe2d11360e9af\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/81d82c1b9e341311aaf8a04a3edbe2d11360e9af/0_0_2000_1200/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nuno Esp\u00edrito Santo during his time in charge at Valencia, with another former Porto coach, Andr\u00e9 Villas-Boas, in the background during a Champions League game against Zenit St Petersburg.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nuno Esp\u00edrito Santo during his time in charge at Valencia, with another former Porto coach, Andr\u00e9 Villas-Boas, in the background during a Champions League game against Zenit St Petersburg.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dmitry Lovetsky/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There was also something a little \u201cBritish\u201d about that Valencia side, he agrees: quick, aggressive, pressing high, direct. \u201cAll coaches say: \u2018We want to control the game, we want the ball, blah, blah, blah, blah,\u2019 but it\u2019s impossible to have the ball all the time,\u201d he says. \u201cIf a team is organised it is really difficult to harm them, so you have to search for the moment they are unbalanced. And when is that? When you recover the ball.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m a coach who likes to have the ball but what I really think is: \u2018How can you be in charge of the game?\u2019 I think, but maybe I am the only one, that the defensive process can take care of the game. Why is that? Because teams wait to defend. If you create something where you go to defend, to steal the ball where you want, it\u2019s different. A defensive process, yes, but you go for it.</p> <p>\u201cEnglish football is changing; it\u2019s not this long ball straight up the pitch. There are moments of possession, but the Premier League does allow you a box-to-box game and I enjoy that. Every possession has to have sense [a reason] and that sense has to be to unbalance the other team. English teams don\u2019t have long possession of the ball, but it\u2019s a curious fact: the Premier League has more ball in play than any other league. That tells you that your game has to be more intense, your players have to be more ready, there is more distance for the players to cover.\u201d</p> <p>The question is obvious: why have Spanish teams done so much better than English ones in Europe? \u201cDifficult,\u201d Nuno says. \u201cI was thinking about that the other day. In terms of the game, I don\u2019t find it [a reason], I really don\u2019t. I don\u2019t see, year by year, why English teams don\u2019t reach a final, with the resources they have. But [last season] you see [Manchester] City in a semi-final. Liverpool in a final. That tells you that it is not like that any more. Premier League teams are ready to [compete].\u201d</p> <p>Leicester City among them. Nuno knows them well; admires them, too. After he left Valencia last season, England became his main focus of analysis, not least because there was interest in him going there before he joined Porto, the club where he had been twice as a player. As he studied the English clubs, the application of sports science was one of the elements that most struck him. He spent time at Tottenham watching Mauricio Pochettino, while his assistant coach visited Manchester City and Leicester. \u201cYou go, you see, you share, you analyse: you see it and think: \u2018How can I adapt that? How can this fit my philosophy?\u2019\u201d he says.</p> <p>\u201cLeicester winning the league was a surprise to everyone but it proved that a united and strong team can achieve big things,\u201d Nuno says. Could it have happened in other leagues? \u201cHonestly, I don\u2019t think so: there are huge differences between the squads of big teams and the others and in long competitions that kind of achievement is very difficult,\u201d he says. \u201cBut you can never say never.</p> <p>\u201cIt is going to be a big chance for us to face Leicester, a fantastic challenge, the opportunity to test our limits against the Premier League champions,\u201d he adds. Porto\u2019s limitations are clear, their chances slim. But, then, so were Leicester\u2019s. And, Nuno says: \u201cI have this absurd feeling that I can win every game with any team.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Welcome to the first <strike> presidential </strike> debate of the 2016 NFL season, held just after week 3 concluded. There are many important issues to discuss, from the Eagles blowing out the Steelers in the battleground state of Pennsylvania, to grievous mismanagement of the clock by first-year head coach Dirk Koetter in Florida. </p> <p>Your moderator will be bolded questions and the debate will be fact-checked throughout by Guardian editors and also commenters reading along at home. Without further delay, let\u2019s begin. </p> <h2><strong>Which 1-2 struggling contender is in bigger trouble: the Cardinals, Panthers or Bengals? </strong></h2> <p><strong>Opinion 1: </strong>Thank you for your question and thank you to everyone reading this important debate. A one-point victory over the Jets in week one is all that\u2019s kept the Bengals from being 0-3. They have to travel to New England next month and they also have three games on their schedule against the undefeated Ravens and Eagles, match-ups that didn\u2019t look too challenging back in August. And instead of Andy Dalton raising his game with Tyler Eifert injured and Marvin Jones lost to free agency, he has noticeably regressed. Cincinnati are in serious danger of not having a playoff game to lose this year.</p> <p><strong>Opinion 2: </strong>Sorry, I don\u2019t have lame zingers like that. I just have facts and analysis. And in all the excitement over <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/25/ryan-fitzpatrick-six-interceptions-new-york-jets-nfl\">Ryan Fitzpatrick\u2019s six-interception game on Sunday</a>, Carson Palmer\u2019s four-pick game got a little overshadowed. But it was a reminder that for all his tools and experience, Palmer can pull out stinker games with the worst of them. If the Cardinals don\u2019t beat the Rams this Sunday, they\u2019ll find themselves in a real hole with the Vikings, Panthers and Seahawks (twice) all still waiting on the schedule. If the Bengals are struggling with Dalton, then the Cardinals must be even worse off with the quarterback Cincinnati got rid of to play Dalton. I clearly win this topic with that bulletproof logic.</p> <h2><strong>Who will be the first NFL coach to get fired this season?</strong></h2> <p><strong>Opinion 1: </strong>It would be justified if Dirk Koetter lost his job for Sunday alone. The guy has a clock management specialist on his staff in Andrew Weidenger and yet he ignored his assistant\u2019s call for a timeout, wasting Tampa\u2019s chance to win the game in the final minute. For a team that should be on the fringe of making the playoffs, Tampa can\u2019t afford mismanaged home losses to teams like the Rams. But Koetter is in his first year at the helm, so Tampa won\u2019t fire him because it would force the front office to admit they screwed up forcing Lovie Smith out for a 57-year-old first-time NFL head coach whose last job running a team ended 10 years ago after a middling 40-34 stint at Arizona State. So I\u2019ll go with Detroit\u2019s Jim Caldwell, the original failed college coach who should be nowhere near the head coach job on an NFL team. Every Vikings offensive player you\u2019ve heard of is on IR and the Packers have taken a step back, yet the Lions still can\u2019t get past either of them in the NFC North. Caldwell should have been fired last year \u2013 and also never hired in the first place in 2014. I cede the rest of my time, but Koetter probably somehow used it all. </p> <p><strong>Opinion 2: </strong>I\u2019d like to run a positive season, so instead of focusing on who should be fired \u2013 and it\u2019s obviously Gus Bradley, Mike McCoy, Rex Ryan, Caldwell and Sean Payton, who is coming fast for Jeff Fisher\u2019s title of \u201cHead Coach Most Likely To Go 7-9 Every Season\u201d \u2013 I want to talk a little bit about the assistants who may deserve head coaching jobs. Philadelphia are already worried about losing defensive coordinator Jim Schwartz, whose top-ranked defense held the supposedly explosive Steelers attack to just three points on Sunday. Ideally, for the sake of entertainment, Schwartz will stay in state but go to the college ranks and takeover at Penn State where he and Michigan head coach Jim Harbaugh can <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWvZGR5xfXw\">shove each other again</a> once a year. Then there\u2019s Patriots offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels. His first stint as head coach of the Broncos as a prepubescent boy was a disaster, but he has matured and learned and, with Tim Tebow now gone to baseball, McDaniels will more easily be able to move on from his QB crush and have success. </p> <h2><strong>Are the 3-0 Eagles now serious contenders in the NFC?</strong></h2> <p><strong>Opinion 1:</strong> I think we all need to take a moment to consider that Carson Wentz is just three games into his NFL career before we declare him a star or his team a legitimate contender. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2016/sep/26/carson-wentz-philadelphia-eagles-nfl\">It's becoming clear that Carson Wentz is no wacky fluke</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It wasn\u2019t long ago in the Eagles own division that Robert Griffin III had clinched a spot in Canton as a rookie. Four years later, he stands on the sidelines each Sunday while the Cleveland Browns attempt football. Just three years ago \u2013 in the very same city of Philadelphia \u2013 it was Nick Foles who looked like the future by throwing for 27 touchdowns and just two interceptions in barely more than half the season. At the start of training camp this year, Foles couldn\u2019t even find a team to employ him.</p> <p>Has Wentz looked promising? Sure. He was the No2 overall pick in the draft, a pick the Eagles got by trading up, so he better look promising at a minimum. Let\u2019s not forget that he\u2019s played so far against the Browns, the Bears and a Steelers secondary that has been bad since <a href=\"https://twitter.com/cj_wentz/status/307993940865474562\">Radio Shack was in its heyday</a>. Let\u2019s stop pretending that Wentz is the first rookie quarterback to win games out of the gate. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SportsCenter/status/778076200698773504\">Ryan Leaf did it</a>. As did <a href=\"https://twitter.com/KNegandhiESPN/status/780351707154964480\">Mark Sanchez</a>. We won\u2019t know if Wentz is legit until the end of the season. And even then we won\u2019t know for sure.</p> <p><strong>Opinion 2:</strong> First of all, you didn\u2019t really address the question about whether the Eagles are a contender in the NFC. Have some respect for the moderator. I will answer the question clearly: the Eagles most definitely are contenders. They\u2019re already 3-0 and in sole possession of first place in a division that was won last year at 9-7. They are also already two games ahead of the supposed favorites in the NFC \u2013 the Panthers and Seahawks \u2013 and having success not with tricks and luck, but behind a stifling defense and efficient quarterback play. You\u2019re probably too dumb to remember this, but that\u2019s the exact approach Denver used to win the Super Bowl last year.</p> <p>As for Wentz, only an idiot or someone who hasn\u2019t watched any of his games and is just cherry-picking stats and factoids would compare him to RG3, Foles, Leaf or Sanchez. The original offense Griffin ran in Washington left him exposed to injury and he never adjusted. After getting drilled in the preseason and in weeks 1 and 2, Wentz has already listened to his coaches and avoided hits in week 3 \u2013 while playing his best game so far. As for Foles, he thrived in the first year of Chip Kelly\u2019s video game offense before NFL teams adjusted. Sanchez merely game-managed his way through the start of his NFL career, while Wentz is making plays \u2013 including on third down where he had an 85.7% completion rate on Sunday, the best in the league. And Ryan Leaf? Come on. Have you no sense of decency?</p> <h2><strong>Finally, would you call Tom Brady a system quarterback? </strong></h2> <p><strong>Opinion 1: </strong>First off, I would like to express my apologies to the good people of New England for even having to read that question. It\u2019s very disrespectful to Mr Brady, who is an NFL legend. With that said, yes, Tom Brady is a system quarterback. The Patriots are now 13-5 without Brady in the lineup since he took over the starting job from Drew Bledsoe many years and cheating scandals ago. If your team doesn\u2019t miss a beat with you not playing, your franchise wins because of the system, not because of one specific player. But with all due respect, Tom Brady might be the greatest system quarterback of all-time. </p> <p><strong>Opinion 2: </strong>I watched Tom Brady. I analyzed Tom Brady. Tom Brady was a fantasy quarterback of mine. Jacoby Brissett is no Tom Brady. If you want to call Tom Brady a \u201csystem\u201d quarterback, be my guest. But at least acknowledge that he created the system with Bill Belichick. There\u2019s no Patriots system without Brady, just like there\u2019s no Apple without Steve Jobs or downfall of the United States without Donald Trump. </p> <p><strong>Thank you for reading the first debate about week 3 of the 2016 season. Check back for possible future debates if America exists after 8 November.</strong></p>",
  "<p>I never intended to write a book. My parents were struggling, impoverished writers and I\u2019d always vowed not to go the same way. But then I stumbled across Lucia Joyce, daughter of James and a dancer in 1920s Paris. I still didn\u2019t want to write a book, but I wanted to know more about her life, her alleged affairs with Alexander Calder and Samuel Beckett, and why she spent the latter half of her life in a mental asylum. When I couldn\u2019t find the answers in her biography, something happened that I still don\u2019t fully understand. I felt a compulsion to uncover and fictionalise her story.</p> <p>I discovered that many of her letters had been purposefully destroyed and this enraged me. At the time, I was intending to become a photographer, but instead I stopped my classes and bought or borrowed every book I could find on Joyce and his circle. Books spilled from every stair, towered from every table-top, squatted in trembling piles on every floor.</p> <p>That should have been a warning sign. The project was too ambitious, too unwieldy. But I couldn\u2019t stop. The story had chosen me and Lucia wasn\u2019t letting go. I\u2019d never been on a writing course and I quickly realised that creating plots, characters and convincing dialogue was far more difficult than it looked. I looked at the roof-scraping stacks of books and panicked. There was no time for a course; I had too many books to read, too many trips to make \u2013 and I had to learn to dance. How could I write about a dancer without learning to dance? </p> <p>I decided to teach myself creative writing and started ordering how-to-write books. The piles grew. The insomnia deepened. I seemed to read all night, every night. And in the grey light of dawn I tossed and turned: Lucia was a very difficult character to construct, and capturing her life was proving more difficult than I could ever have imagined. Still she did not let go.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Several people had told me my novel was too highbrow for the ordinary reader and too lowbrow for the Joyceans</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>As part of my research I started rereading Joyce. Dubliners and A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man were a joy. But then there was Ulysses and \u2013 oh God! \u2013 Finnegans Wake. There they sat, beside my bed, accusatory and demanding. I tried to tell myself this was Lucia\u2019s story, it was not about Joyce. I wasn\u2019t even writing in an experimental style. To no avail. Ulysses and Finnegans Wake started following me round the house like hungry dogs. By this point, several people had told me my novel was too highbrow for the ordinary reader and too lowbrow for the Joyceans. A friendly agent suggested I was trespassing on hallowed ground and should find another story that didn\u2019t involve so many iconic men. Meanwhile, my children were asking for a proper meal and my husband was politely suggesting I move to the spare room. Still, Lucia gripped me.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Finally, I bit the bullet and picked up Ulysses. Within minutes I was panicking \u2013 again. I\u2019d read Ulysses before \u2013 twice \u2013 but I\u2019d clearly wiped the experience from my mind. This was not a book to be read by torchlight in the early hours of the morning. What was I thinking! I googled Ulysses courses and found a six-month salon. I enrolled, read all the background books, listened to the audiobook and scoured the web for sources. But would it help me understand Lucia\u2019s predicament? Would it help me imagine myself into her elusive, shifting character? </p> <p>The answer is yes, it did. Studying Ulysses in a group rather than reading it alone forced me to pause, to scrutinise every line, to search beyond the words to the author lurking behind. Suddenly facets of Lucia that I hadn\u2019t fully grasped began to fall into place. And I became more and more absorbed by some of the thrilling prose, and by the way Joyce built his protagonist, Leopold Bloom. I may not have learned much about plot, pace and tension (which I was determined to have in my novel), but I learned about prose, character and resilience. And so Ulysses ended up being both research into Lucia and a guide to crafting fiction.</p> <h2>Extract</h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Mama writhed and twisted in front of the mirror. \u201cThis hat or the black one, Lucia?\u201d</p> <p>Her words floated across the air like vapour. I barely heard them as I stared out of the window, straining in the direction of the rue d\u2019Ulm. The last few leaves clung to the boughs of the trees. And beneath them the street lamps cast ragged circles of light onto the cobbled road. The smell of roasting chestnuts from the braziers on the rue de Grenelle seeped through the ill-fitting window frame, but I barely noticed that either. I moved as though in a dream, unable to feel the floor beneath my feet. All I saw, in every direction, was Mr Beckett\u2019s face \u2013 his cheekbones in the bare branches of the trees, his eyes reflected in the darkening swell of the sky. My skin prickled all over and I felt light and tight at the same time. I said his name, wordlessly, again and again. Mr Beckett. Mr Beckett. Mr Beckett.</p> </blockquote> <h2>More about the book</h2> <p>Dancing, declares Lucia, is \u201cthe most important thing in my life\u201d and she has a great gift for it, evoking the euphoria of performing before a rapturous audience. Dancing was her \u201clifebelt\u201d, but when distracted from her vocation, manacled to her father as his muse and fatally attracted to his protege Samuel Beckett, she starts sinking.</p> <p>Here is a powerful portrait of a young woman yearning to be an artist, whose passion for life \u2013 and rage at being unable to fulfil her talent \u2013 burns from the page. \u2013 <strong>Anita Sethi</strong></p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jun/12/the-joyce-girl-annabel-abbs-review\">Read the full review.</a></strong></p> <h2>Buy the book</h2> <p>The Joyce Girl is published by Impress Books at \u00a38.99 and <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/the-joyce-girl.html\">is available from the Guardian Bookshop for \u00a36.99</a>.</p>",

When it comes to superheroes, it feels like there has been a tangible shift in power. The most exciting, emotional and surprising storytelling is now happening on TV, where the genre has been rising, diversifying and thriving.</p> <p>Superhero TV is nothing new. Lynda Carter\u2019s glamazon and Lou Ferrigno\u2019s green monster helped cement Wonder Woman and the Hulk\u2019s place in pop culture, while Adam West\u2019s 1960s Batman lives on in every news headline that features the word \u201cKapow!\u201d. The demands of crafting a weekly show have always chimed with the serialised source material: stories designed to go on indefinitely, but with enough intrigue to make sure that audiences came back for the next instalment. Now, the 21st-century approach has added new levels of sophistication to this combustible mix.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytkjQvSk2VA\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ytkjQvSk2VA?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>It helps, of course, that TV can move quickly. The kickass introduction of African warrior-king Black Panther in Civil War was well received, but he won\u2019t get his own movie until summer 2018. Instead, the first Marvel headliner of colour is Luke Cage, a benevolent beefcake with impenetrable skin, who is the latest superhero to be granted their own Netflix series. Set and shot in Harlem, Luke Cage is a superhero narrative where the good guy is a fugitive, holds down two menial jobs and hides out in a barbershop rather than a Batcave. Sensitive, soulful and strapping, Cage (played The Good Wife\u2019s Mike Colter) confronts use of the N-word head on and duffs up gangbangers in a hoodie rather than spandex, all to a soundtrack jammed with classic hip-hop. At a time when young black men are being gunned down weekly in the US, having a lead character who is literally bulletproof also carries serious symbolic heft.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e303e4e120d5798f2105066cc2860c8fd9cafdd4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e303e4e120d5798f2105066cc2860c8fd9cafdd4/0_34_2573_1544/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Daredevil.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Charlie Cox as Daredevil.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Patrick Harbron/Netflix</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Luke Cage could arguably have worked as a movie, but a lot of its textural pleasures come during downtime: with 13 hours to tell its story, it can dig much deeper than the exposition dumps and smart one-liners that constitute blockbuster screenwriting. Indeed, the difference between The Avengers and Netflix\u2019s slate of comic-book shows is night and day; literally, since the streaming service\u2019s antiheroes are generally nocturnal. The first of these, Daredevil \u2013 about a blind vigilante with uncanny super-senses \u2013 was proof that this patient narrative approach could work. It spent as much time building up its baddie, the brutal Kingpin, as its title character, and even withheld the traditional pleasure of seeing its hero in a proper costume until the final moments of season one.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/apr/10/daredevil-tv-emo-superhero\">Meet Daredevil,  TV\u2019s emo superhero</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Jessica Jones \u2013 the Netflix show that featured Luke Cage among its ensemble \u2013 was even more of an experiment, spotlighting a female character with zero brand recognition but turning that into an advantage. Here was a superhero series that even people who didn\u2019t like superheroes could enjoy. It refashioned the ancient comic-book trope of mind control into a serious exploration of surviving sexual abuse, as private-eye Jones (Krysten Ritter) struggled to cope with the emotional aftershocks of her treatment at the hands of brainwashing sadist Kilgrave (David Tennant), despite her physical super-strength. No tights, no flights: Jessica Jones was a psychological thriller comparable to The Fall, and thanks to widespread critical attention, attracted a whole new audience to the genre.</p> <p>Next on Netflix\u2019s list is a standalone series for Iron Fist, a mystic-but-minor kung-fu character who would never realistically be considered for a movie. In 2017, all four of Netflix\u2019s heroes will come together for an Avengers-sounding team-up called The Defenders; hopefully that series won\u2019t smooth off the edges that make these shows so intriguing in the first place.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7d6ba8b3528d8af6de1e358d9c9c9524a846aa76\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7d6ba8b3528d8af6de1e358d9c9c9524a846aa76/416_0_3088_1853/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Krysten Ritter as Jessica Jones.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Krysten Ritter as Jessica Jones.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/MARVEL STUDIOS</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It\u2019s not just Marvel supes who are thriving on TV. While DC characters such as Superman and Batman are being ill-served at the multiplex, multitasking showrunner Greg Berlanti has quietly built his own DC Comics universe entirely separate from the Warners movies. Berlanti \u2013 a veteran of Dawson\u2019s Creek and primetime soaps including Dirty Sexy Money \u2013 has launched four TV series in the past few years that, as well as delivering muscular action, have championed diverse casting and LGBT themes, while interrogating what being a hero actually means in the 21st century.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/nov/20/marvels-jessica-jones-netflix-krysten-ritter\">Marvel's Jessica Jones: the smartest superhero show for aeons</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Arrow is gritty and redemptive, as archer Oliver Queen evolves from a vigilante murderer into something more recognisably noble. The Flash is effects-heavy and fun, with a hero who, refreshingly, finds his super-speed powers to be exhilarating rather than a drag. Supergirl explores a young woman\u2019s relatable struggle to find a work-life balance while trying to escape the shadow of a more successful relative. And while Legends Of Tomorrow \u2013 about a misfit team bouncing through time to save the cosmos \u2013 initially felt like a clearing house for minor characters left over from Arrow and Flash, even that thrifty setup had a tragic edge. These \u201clegends\u201d were selected precisely because if they died it would have no lasting effect on history. So among the bickering team banter and historical dress-up there is an existential question: why do the right thing when the universe has already decided you\u2019re irrelevant? While these shows exist in a heightened reality where gods walk among us and time portals are real, they still see the importance of remaining grounded in human emotion.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e5d527e6cf997263ad87a31648b9968d58d3b0ed\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e5d527e6cf997263ad87a31648b9968d58d3b0ed/551_115_3403_2042/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Melissa Benoist as Supergirl.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Melissa Benoist as Supergirl.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Warner Bros</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Elsewhere, TV\u2019s appetite for superheroes is opening up intriguing new avenues. Amazon\u2019s comedy pilot The Tick, starring Peter Serafinowicz as a big blue bug skewered superhero tropes while exploring mental illness. Another sitcom, Powerless \u2013 due in early 2017 \u2013 is set in the civilian margins of the DC universe, with Vanessa Hudgens as an insurance agent cleaning up Superman\u2019s collateral damage. And Marvel is closing in on the YA market, prepping Cloak And Dagger for the teen-targeted US network Freeform, based on a comic about the romance between between two young runaways who have diametrically opposed powers.</p> <p>Most excitingly, Fargo showrunner Noah Hawley is disrupting the X-Men universe with new drama Legion. In the source material, Legion is Professor Xavier\u2019s reality-warping son, a mutant with multiple personalities. Judging by the trailer \u2013 featuring telekineses, a Bollywood-style dance number and Downton Abbey\u2019s Dan Stevens in a righteous orange tracksuit top \u2013 Hawley is aiming for the strange. Could this be comic-book TV\u2019s Twin Peaks moment, the point where it goes up, up and away?

Our Skype conversation is interrupted by bursts of laughter as she talks at speed, emanating the restless energy that has enabled her to alternate between writing plays, film and TV scripts, with acting stints in between. <br></p> <p>Scorch, which <a href=\"http://www.irishtimes.com/culture/stage/stacey-gregg-s-play-scorch-wins-a-fringe-first-in-edinburgh-1.2769781\">won a Fringe First award at the Edinburgh festival</a> last month, was written in response to recent court cases in the UK. \u201cThese were cases taken by women who had been deceived into thinking they were having a sexual relationship with a man, but discovered that their partner was a woman or, in one case, a trans man. The accusations were of \u2018gender fraud\u2019, which for me is a contested term. I thought that the media coverage sensationalised these cases, and this drove me to try to communicate the questions they raised in a more complex way.\u201d<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"59826d91c4cabb8ec5f8be70c84a9253b75d7911\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/59826d91c4cabb8ec5f8be70c84a9253b75d7911/0_133_5483_3289/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Amy McAllister in Scorch at the Edinburgh festival.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Amy McAllister in Scorch at the Edinburgh festival.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo Macleod/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Initially envisaging it as a TV script, Gregg reworked Scorch as a stage play, which she performed herself, before handing it over to the Northern Irish company Prime Cut. Directed by Emma Jordan, it was produced as part of the Outburst Queer Arts festival in Belfast last autumn. Poignantly performed by Amy McAllister, the solo piece captures the confusion of a teenage girl called Kes who wants to be a boy, and begins an online relationship with a young woman who assumes that Kes is male. The virtual world seems perfect to Kes, allowing her the freedom to present herself as she wants to be.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s about the limitations of language, and of access to language. Kes doesn\u2019t have words for her feelings,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m interested in responses to the play, its interpretation as a trans piece, because that seems to ignore aspects of lesbian sexuality. It is as if butch lesbians have gone away \u2013 they haven\u2019t \u2013 and now we can only talk about this in terms of a medicalised idea of transition from one gender to another.\u201d</p> <p>Override examines what happens to relationships when people use technology to enhance or augment their bodies. It fizzes with ideas about <a href=\"http://www.biobasedworldnews.com/biohacking-everything-you-need-to-know-about-diy-biology\">biohacking</a>, prosthetic envy and robotics. Its central questions are philosophical, to do with human perfectibility and utopianism. \u201cAll of that, and how to be authentic,\u201d Gregg says, \u201cand the continuum we are on when we introduce wearable technology.

The plays will subsequently tour. Her solo piece, Choice, interweaves two stories \u2013 one of a British woman who is trying to conceive by IVF and one of an Irish woman travelling to England for an abortion. The piece will be performed by Gregg herself. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to describe the form it\u2019s taking, but it is developed from workshops and research, and will be lo-fi.

Moving between Dublin, Belfast and London, she enjoys what she calls her dual citizenship. \u201cDublin has been good to me. Rough Magic Theatre Company\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.roughmagic.ie/artist-development/seeds\">Seeds programme</a> was the start, and then the Abbey theatre gave me my first break, for which I\u2019m really grateful.\u201d Her first full-length play, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2011/jun/06/perve-review\">Perve</a> \u2013 a prescient work tackling the sexualisation of children and the pervasiveness of pornography \u2013 was produced by the Abbey in 2011, followed last year by <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5GCUNZKnzE\">Shibboleth</a>, which took a chaotically satirical view of Belfast\u2019s peace walls.<br></p> <p>Having grown up in Belfast in the aftermath of the Troubles, Gregg left the city to study English at Cambridge, where she narrowly avoided being sent down and was acutely aware of her working-class roots. This was followed by an MA in documentary film-making in London. She is increasingly drawn to writing about Northern Ireland, with a number of her plays set there \u2013 Ismene, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2012/oct/29/huzzies-review\">Huzzies</a>, Shibboleth \u2013 as well as two feature films in the pipeline.

  "<p><strong>UPDATE. September 2017: lawyers for Sam Allardyce have contacted us to say that he disputes the allegation that he gave advice on how to circumvent the FA\u2019s rules on third party ownership. </strong></p> <p><strong>What is Allardyce accused of? </strong></p> <p>The England manager has been caught on camera giving advice to reporters posing as Far East businessmen on how to \u201cget round rules\u201d about third-party ownership of players. In footage filmed by undercover Telegraph reporters, Allardyce said it was \u201cnot a problem\u201d to bypass the rules introduced by his employer, the Football Association, in 2008. He told the reporters he knew of certain agents \u201cdoing it all the time\u201d and added: \u201cYou can still get around it. I mean obviously the big money\u2019s here.\u201d Allardyce discussed an offer that would see him fly to Singapore and Hong Kong four times a year to address investors in a firm that wanted to buy footballers, for which he would be paid \u00a3400,000 a year.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Telegraph video\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-video&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Sam Allardyce caught on camera advising how to get around FA rules &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/LkRBwuiD2N&quot;&gt;https://t.co/LkRBwuiD2N&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/cvPu6pUhnv&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/cvPu6pUhnv&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; The Telegraph (@Telegraph) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Telegraph/status/780722543493689345&quot;&gt;September 27, 2016&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;script async src=&quot;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p><strong>What are the rules banning third-party ownership of footballers? </strong></p> <p>The controversial practice, which has been likened to slave ownership, was outlawed in the UK in 2008. Last year Fifa imposed a worldwide ban on the practice. The bans are intended to stop third-party owners, such as companies or agents, profiting from players being sold on the transfer market. In 2014 the Guardian revealed that an internal <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/fifa\">Fifa</a> report found that third-party ownership trapped clubs in a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/sep/26/sepp-blatter-fifa-ban-third-party-ownership\">\u201cvicious cycle of debt and dependence\u201d</a> and posed risks to players and to the integrity of the game. </p> <p><strong>Will Allardyce be sacked?</strong></p> <p>That rather depends on whether the Telegraph investigation uncovered any more alleged wrongdoing by Allardyce. As it stands, Allardyce will have to explain whether he was merely giving an honest account of what happened in the sport or if he was advising the \u201cbusinessmen\u201d to follow those practices. If it is the latter it could be serious enough for his position to be in question. Allardyce and his lawyers are likely to point out that he repeatedly told the uncover reporters that he would have to check with the FA before agreeing to take any action and that no wrongdoing took place. <br></p> <p><strong>What has been the FA\u2019s response? </strong></p> <p>The FA, which is both Allardyce\u2019s employer and football\u2019s governing body, has requested full transcripts of the secret recordings. It is due to assess the allegations at meeting at Wembley on Tuesday. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODa9mZ9XjkI\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ODa9mZ9XjkI?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Third-party ownership explained</figcaption> </figure>   <p><strong>When did third-party ownership first emerge? </strong></p> <p>Third-party ownership is is still common in many countries, particularly in South America. It became an issue in the UK in 2006 after West Ham United\u2019s controversial deal to buy the Argentinian stars Carlos Tevez and Javier Mascherano. Under the agreement, Tevez was brought to West Ham from the Brazilian club Corinthians in order to put him in the shop window, and his investors could effectively decide when he was sold, to which club and for how much. It led the Premier League to ban third-party ownership outright but its use as a means for clubs in Spain and Portugal to buy players they might not otherwise be able to afford continues to grow.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/26/sam-allardyce-fa-newspaper-sting-england-manager\">Sam Allardyce embarrasses FA with revelations in newspaper sting</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Speaking in March last year, Michel Platini, then Uefa president, condemned the use of TPO: \u201cI think we are dealing with a type of slavery that belongs in the past,\u201d he said. \u201cToday it is shameful to see some players with one of their arms belonging to one person, a leg belonging to a pension fund located who knows where and a third person owning his foot.\u201d</p>",

Economists still debate the effect of the deal on jobs, since US trade with Canada and Mexico is modest at best. In 2015, the <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2016/06/22/483100251/fact-check-trumps-speech-on-clinton-annotated\">Congressional Research Service wrote</a>: \u201cNafta did not cause the huge job losses feared by the critics or the large economic gains predicted by supporters.\u201d</p> <p>Manufacturing is down 37% <a href=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MANEMP\">since its peak in 1979</a>, but this change has a great deal to do with the general shift toward a service-based economy, which the US has had surpluses in in recent years. It\u2019s true that many manufacturing jobs have been outsourced, especially since China joined the World Trade Organization in 2001, but it\u2019s also true that the US has added more than 800,000 factory jobs since 2010.</p> <h2><strong>Trump: \u201cMy father gave me a small loan in 1975.\u201d</strong></h2> <p>Trump never struggled for money or started with anything modest.

A 1981 <a href=\"https://www.scribd.com/doc/301761265/Report-on-Donald-Trump-to-Casino-Control-Commission\">report by a New Jersey regulator</a> also shows a $7.5m loan from the patriarch, and years later he <a href=\"http://articles.philly.com/1991-04-09/news/25780577_1_casino-control-act-donald-trump-casino-owners\">bought $3.5m in gambling chips</a> to help his son pay off the debts of a failing casino, which was <a href=\"http://articles.philly.com/1991-04-09/news/25780577_1_casino-control-act-donald-trump-casino-owners\">found to have broken the law by accepting them</a>.

  "<h2><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Lloyd_(TV_producer)\">Christopher Lloyd</a>, co-creator</h2> <p>We were playing around with a lot of ideas for sitcoms but they didn\u2019t seem real. So we thought, how about what we talk about between ourselves \u2013 our kids and the idiotic things that happen in our households? Is there a way to do a family show \u2013 which is, in a way, the most trite subject on TV \u2013 that makes it a bit more real? That got us to the documentary-style idea. And we wanted the families to be united in some way, so we made them three parts of a whole.</p> <p>Comedy had become this thing that was easily consumed, but ultimately not very nutritious. There was lots of snarkiness and cynicism but nothing uplifting, nothing good for the soul. No protein! We wanted our show to have some heart, which left us open to criticism that we were being sentimental. But we wanted moments of drama and emotion.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"47034d5ee6eb22cfedd6e50aa23880ad07f9f1f1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/47034d5ee6eb22cfedd6e50aa23880ad07f9f1f1/0_140_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018We knew we wanted to have multiple families, to bounce back and forth\u2019 \u2026 the cast of Modern Family.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018We knew we wanted to have multiple families, to bounce back and forth\u2019 \u2026 the cast of Modern Family.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bob D'Amico/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When it came to casting, I had worked with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2014/feb/01/ty-burrell-this-much-i-know\">Ty Burrell</a>, who plays Phil Dunphy, on a couple of things, and couldn\u2019t understand how he had been floating around as long as he had without being on a hit show.

Plus I had just done an experimental low-budget pilot and shot it documentary-style and really fell in love with the form. From a production standpoint, it allows us to move so much faster.

Our hours are great; everybody\u2019s happy.</p> <p>When it came to constructing the family, there were so many points we could have made.

He could be starting over. Then we wanted cross-cultural aspects \u2013 the father\u2019s new wife could be African American, Hispanic, Asian, for example.</p> <p>I see a lot of pilots, and what people do is create characters that work for that initial episode, but once that story\u2019s over they don\u2019t know what to do because they haven\u2019t clear conflicts or relationships. It took us about six weeks to figure out who everyone was, before we even looked at plot.

Here\u2019s a summary of what happened:</p> <ul> <li>Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump engaged in an occasionally raw series of clashes on topics from trade policy to the Iran deal to Trump\u2019s taxes.</li> <li>The Republican candidate came out swinging on Nafta and on, he said, his Democratic rival\u2019s failed record of public service. His most aggressive attacks had Clinton appealing to \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/26/debate-fact-check-trump-clinton-live-quotes-hofstra\">fact checkers</a>\u201d instead of offering rebuttals.</li> <li>Clinton\u2019s performance was magisterial. She slipped easily into the details of many policy areas \u2013 cyber warfare, community policing, paid family leave \u2013 that Trump could not touch.</li> <li>Clinton also scored the biggest moment of wit, at the end of a long Trump boast about his temperament, which he delivered hotly. \u201cWhew, OK!\u201d she said when he was through, smiling.</li> <li>Clinton flayed Trump on his refusal to release his tax returns, on his \u201clong record\u201d of \u201cracist behavior,\u201d on his lack of knowledge about the deal to withdraw US troops from Iraq, on climate change being a Chinese \u201choax,\u201d and on and on. But his best line was: \u201cHillary\u2019s got experience but it\u2019s bad experience.\u201d</li> <li>Clinton\u2019s best line (apart from \u201cwhew, OK!\u201d): \u201cI think Donald just criticized me for preparing for this debate. And yes I did. And you know what else I prepared for? I prepared to be president. And that\u2019s a good thing.\u201d</li> <li>Clinton\u2019s runner-up best line, in reply to a Trump charge that \u201cwe don\u2019t have the money because it\u2019s been squandered on your ideas\u201d, was: \u201cMaybe it\u2019s because you haven\u2019t paid your taxes!\u201d</li> <li>There were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2016/sep/26/hillary-clinton-donald-trump-presidential-debate-live?page=with:block-57e9cf34e4b0a785ec48bcd8#liveblog-navigation\">lots of manterruptions</a>. Trump also had the sniffles.</li> <li>Trump lost altitude quickly after the first half hour, shifting from pointed interruptions to a more incoherent, sloppy pattern of interruption. </li> <li>Trump tried to deny five years of spreading birtherism \u2013 the conspiracy theory that Barack Obama was born outside the US. Clinton replied sharply: \u201cIt can\u2019t be dismissed that easily ... He has a long record in engaging in racist behavior.\u201d</li> <li>Trump cast doubt on the notion that the hacking of the Democratic National Committee was Russia-backed. He said it may have been China, or bizarrely, a \u201c400lb person sitting on their bed\u201d.</li> <li>Clinton said neighborhood security would come from community policing and getting guns off streets while Trump called for \u201claw and order\u201d and \u201cstop-and-frisk\u201d.</li> <li>Clinton poked fun at Trump\u2019s unlimited indictment of her record. \u201cI have a feeling that by the end of this evening everything is going to be my fault,\u201d she said. Then Trump agreed with her.</li> </ul>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ABCPolitics/status/780599581994209280\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">.<a href=\"https://twitter.com/HillaryClinton\">@HillaryClinton</a> after Trump&#39;s comment about her temperament: &quot;Whew!

To study dusting!\u201d says Will.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s what they teach,\u201d replies Karen.</p> <p>In the show, Karen had supposedly shot at Rosario, but that just became a comment about gun control.</p> <p>\u201cIf Crooked Hillary had her way, I wouldn\u2019t have that gun and I\u2019d have to use my cannon and Rosario would be dead,\u201d said Karen.</p> <p>When Will complains that Trump uses hateful language to talk about people, Karen turns to Grace.</p> <p>\u201cDid you hear what your pussy gay Muslim boyfriend just said?\u201d she asks.</p> <p>Will\u2019s friend Jack stars as the undecided voter who is considering not bothering to cast a ballot in November.</p> <p>\u201cBut does my vote even matter? How can one unemployed white fella registered in Pennsylvania make a difference?\u201d he asks.</p> <p>Grace attempts to appeal as Clinton being the first female president. But Jack isn\u2019t convinced, saying he hasn\u2019t heard \u201cthe one thing that will convince me to vote for one candidate over the other\u201d.</p> <p>But Will knows exactly what to stay to win over the urban gay Jack. \u201cKaty Perry likes Hillary,\u201d he says.</p> <p>At the end of the \u201cepisode\u201d, the words #votehoney appears.

Treasury secretary Jack Lew has <a href=\"http://www.c-span.org/video/?327246-1/secretaries-kerry-moniz-lew-testimony-iran-nuclear-agreement\">put the number at $56bn</a>, and Iranian officials have said <a href=\"http://www.presstv.com/Detail/2016/01/19/446415/Iran-32bn-unfrozen-assets\">$32bn</a> and <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/iran-claims-100-billion-now-freed-in-major-step-as-sanctions-roll-back/2016/02/01/edfc23ca-c8e5-11e5-a7b2-5a2f824b02c9_story.html\">$100bn</a>.

Economists still debate the effect of the deal on jobs, since US trade with Canada and Mexico is modest at best.

It\u2019s true that many manufacturing jobs have been outsourced, especially since China joined the World Trade Organization in 2001, but it\u2019s also true that the US has added more than 800,000 factory jobs since 2010.</p> <p><strong>Trump: \u201cMy father gave me a small loan in 1975.\u201d</strong></p> <p>Trump never struggled for money or started with anything modest.

Don\u2019t take my word for it (you probably wouldn\u2019t if I was reading this aloud) - this is based on a <a href=\"http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0051216\">study</a> into human voice pitch research conducted in 2012. The methodology couldn\u2019t be more relevant to this debate.</p> <p>In the study, 10 women and 10 men were recorded saying the phrase \u201cI urge you to vote for me this November\u201d - a sentence that\u2019s about elections and yet is politically neutral. The researchers then manipulated the sounds of the recordings to be lower or higher and played them to a bunch of men and women who were asked which hypothetical candidate they\u2019d vote for. They found that male and female leaders with lower-pitched voices (ie those that are more stereotypically masculine) were preferred by both men and women.</p> <p>Here\u2019s how the authors interpreted the results: \u201cThis bias could be a consequence of lower-pitched female voices being perceived as more competent, stronger, and more trustworthy \u2026 [and] in the case of men\u2019s voices, men with lower-pitched voices are larger, stronger, and more aggressive.\u201d</p> <p>The findings can be corroborated by any woman who has ever spoken in a meeting. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"10dc7e1b5cd76e0ff01c4bd959ed0e6f3bb5510f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/10dc7e1b5cd76e0ff01c4bd959ed0e6f3bb5510f/0_0_2629_1578/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Reaction to female and male candidates compared\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Reaction to female and male candidates compared</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Report</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57e9be72e4b0a785ec48bc8e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-27T00:35:19.010Z\">1.35am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>We\u2019ve asked for your favorite music to fact-check to.

Such a voter may not react to the same thing the crowd reacts to, the campaigns react to or, needless to say, the media reacts to. Watch and judge for yourself, America ... and the world.</p> <p>They\u2019re going to start soon. Both candidates arrive onstage as practiced debaters, though Trump does not have any experience facing just one other person. He participated in a dozen primary-season debates this cycle, while Clinton participated in nine \u2026 plus the two dozen she showed up for in 2008.</p> <p>Thank you for reading, and please join us in the comments!</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/scottbix/status/780564439514963969\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Brb getting Oreos.</p>&mdash; Scott Bixby (@scottbix) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/scottbix/status/780564439514963969\">September 27, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-09-27T00:31:12.742Z\">at 1.31am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57e9ba98e4b0593b3cb15008\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-27T00:19:31.238Z\">1.19am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here\u2019s Clinton aide Philippe Reines \u2013 best-known among journalists as the state department spokesman who <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/blogs/media/2015/03/how-philippe-reines-handles-the-press-203496\">told a reporter to fuck off</a> \u2013 playing Trump in a debate prep session:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/brianefallon/status/780558043457196033\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">There are multiple Trumps.

It\u2019s also because polls, which have come to be the manna of political analysts, now offer less help in making sense of it all.</p> <p>In past elections, the polls had settled down by Labor Day. This year, they continue to point all over the place. On Sunday, a survey by the <a href=\"https://today.yougov.com/news/2016/09/25/yougoveconomist-poll-september-22-24-2016/\">Economist and YouGov</a> found that Hillary Clinton had a lead of 4%. Less than 24 hours later, a poll from the <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/politics/\">LA Times and USC Tracking</a> put Donald Trump 4% ahead.</p> <p>Both pollsters are considered credible, which makes this even more confusing.</p> <p>This series is intended to help you make sense of the ceaseless onslaught of numbers by taking a closer look at just one poll. But to start us off, I want to talk about a crucial tool in polling analysis: the <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/us/general_election_trump_vs_clinton-5491.html\">average</a>.</p> <p>The site <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/us/general_election_trump_vs_clinton-5491.html\">Real Clear Politics</a> (RCP) takes the average of all recent credible polls to create a moving average. Right now, RCP has Clinton with 45.9% of the vote while Trump has 43.8%, meaning that the Democratic nominee is ahead by 2.1%.</p> <p>Notice how <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/democrats\">Democrats</a> aren\u2019t singing from the rooftops or gloating on Twitter? It\u2019s because 2.1% means nothing.</p> <p>It\u2019s so small, it could be down to errors in the ways that polls are conducted. It\u2019s so narrow, it could easily be reversed by individuals who change their mind or who are not honestly disclosing how they plan to vote. <br></p> <p>The takeaway? Going into <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/25/hillary-clinton-donald-trump-debate-gennifer-flowers\">tonight\u2019s debate</a>, the two candidates are neck and neck.</p> <p>But how much do debates matter? As my former colleague Lauren Leatherby has<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/14/hillary-clinton-polls-convention-trump-election-data\">pointed out</a>, they have hurt candidates in the polls (see Barack Obama in 2012 and George Bush in 2004). But ultimately those candidates have been able to recover by election day (see, uh, the same candidates).</p> <p>So even if tonight produces a clear loser, the November vote is not a done deal.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/26/skeptical-polling-clinton-trump-before-first-debate\">How are Clinton and Trump polling before the first debate?</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57e949f3e4b0a785ec48ba9f\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-26T17:00:24.328Z\">6.00pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Monmouth poll: Clinton has 4-point lead over Trump</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Eight hours before going toe-to-toe at the first presidential debate of the general election campaign, Hillary Clinton has a four-point lead over Donald Trump among likely voters nationwide, according to a just-released Monmouth University poll.

Libertarian party nominee Gary Johnson is polling at 8% in the survey and Green nominee Jill Stein is at 2%. Among all registered voters, and not just those most likely to vote in the upcoming election, Clinton leads with 45%, while Trump falls slightly further behind with 40% Trump.</p> <p>Among her compatriots in the Democratic party, Clinton has the support of 91% of party members, while Trump has won 85% of Republicans. This is an improvement for Trump, who previously counted only one-in-four Republican voters in his corner. Monmouth\u2019s polling suggests that independents are cutting right, supporting Trump over Clinton by 39% to 33%, a precipitous drop for the former secretary of state, who held a five-point lead among independent voters in late August.</p> <p>The generation gaps are in keeping with previous polling. Clinton leads among millennial voters under the age of 35 by 48% to Trump\u2019s 28%, while voters 35 to 54 support Trump at and Clinton at 41%. For voters older than 55, support is similarly divided, with 47% supporting Clinton and 46% supporting Trump.</p> <p>\u201cClinton\u2019s support has softened since the summer, but she has still managed to grab a share of those who tend to vote Republican,\u201d Patrick Murray, director of the Monmouth University Polling Institute, said in a statement.</p> <p>The historically unpopular major-party candidates are still viewed negatively by large majorities of the electorate. According to the survey, 36% of voters view Clinton positively, while 54% view her negatively.

Instead of one signature issue, Clinton has dozens of detailed policies on a host of subjects. It may make her a great president one day, but for now voters struggle to understand what slogans such as \u201cstronger together\u201d mean in practice. If Clinton were forced to pick one concrete thing for viewers to remember her for, what would it be?</p> <p><strong>Do you believe in globalisation?<br></strong>Over many years in public life, the former secretary of state has understandably embraced an evolving set of economic positions. But few have come further than Clinton on the subject of free trade deals and the damage they may or may not have done to American manufacturing. She says she opposes the Trans-Pacific Partnership now proposed by Obama, but is it a principled opposition or a mere pragmatic response to Trump? Are there limits to the benefits of globalisation for US workers?</p> <p><strong>How would your counter-terrorism policy differ from Obama\u2019s?<br></strong>In the face of continued terrorist attacks, the issue of \u201cdefending America\u201d will be top of Monday\u2019s agenda. Yet Clinton risks being caught between defending the legacy of an Obama administration in which she served and acknowledging that not everything is working out well right now. How would she defeat Islamic State? Would she be more or less hawkish in Iraq and Afghanistan? If nothing changes, then Trump may be able to pin her to a range of foreign policy failures.</p> <p><strong>Why are you so secretive?<br></strong>From <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/03/hillary-clinton-email-server-potential-vice-presidents-defend-brown-booker-becerra-perez\">emails</a> to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/15/hillary-clinton-returns-campaign-pneumonia\">pneumonia</a>, Clinton has repeatedly got herself into trouble by going out of her way to hide information from the public. The obvious question is: what does she have to hide? The usual explanation is that Clinton has been on the receiving end of so many smears over the years that she has learned to be cautious, but this should also teach her to be wary of cover-ups. Why should someone who ignores medical advice to rest, or legal advice to keep email on government servers, be trusted to take wise decisions in office?</p> <p><strong>How would you reduce income inequality?<br></strong>Supporters would argue that Clinton has provided many answers to this question: from infrastructure spending and a jobs program to minimum wage increases and taxing the rich. Yet many still wonder if a campaign so heavily funded by America\u2019s rich and powerful really understands or is committed to helping its middle class. Her answers may be more nuanced than Trump\u2019s crude protectionism, but they need to cut through with voters if she is to blunt his appeal in the rust belt.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/24/donald-trump-hillary-clinton-debate-awkward-questions\">10 awkward debate questions to put Clinton and Trump on the spot</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57e94652e4b0593b3cb14e31\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-26T16:15:54.036Z\">5.15pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">What are the third-party candidates up to?</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0616c809fe36cc82f4de448b19fda2454c10a9e4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0616c809fe36cc82f4de448b19fda2454c10a9e4/0_0_3957_2727/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jill Stein\" width=\"1000\" height=\"689\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jill Stein</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Derek Henkle/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton and Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump will be the only two candidates to participate in tonight\u2019s presidential debate at Hofstra University on Long Island - polling limitations have limited the field to just the two major-party candidates, as has happened in every presidential debate since 1992 - but that doesn\u2019t mean that the other would-be presidents have given up on participating in some capacity.</p> <p>Former New Mexico governor and Libertarian presidential nominee Gary Johnson will watch tonight\u2019s debate from New York City with his running mate, Bill Weld, and will be livetweeting the proceedings from Twitter\u2019s offices in Chelsea.</p> <p>Green party nominee Jill Stein, meanwhile, plans to \u201cliterally insert herself\u201d into the debate tonight, responding to each of the debate questions via Periscope livestream.

He has made a number of erratic comments appearing to suggest a cavalier approach to nuclear proliferation; he has also threatened to undermine both Nato and a longstanding commitment to non-nuclear allies in Asia. Combining all this with a general belligerence that terrifies even generals, Trump has much to do to reassure voters he is not a dangerous loose cannon.</p> <p><strong>Did you support US intervention in Iraq and Libya?<br></strong>Trump has tried to have his cake and eat it on the subject of Middle East policy, attacking Clinton for backing regime change in Iraq and Libya while implying he was opposed to both wars at the time. But though this real estate investor\u2019s foreign policy views were not then widely sought out, there is a <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2016/02/25/timeline-of-trumps-comments-on-iraq-invasion-not-loud-not-strong-and-no-headlines/?postshare=7121471286662065&amp;tid=ss_tw\">plenty of evidence</a> to suggest he kept any opposition very quiet. Asked if he backed the invasion of Iraq, he said: \u201cI guess so.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Why would Mexico pay for you to build a wall?<br></strong>The flagship policy of building a physical wall on the southern border is frequently embellished with a boast that Trump would make sure Mexico paid for its construction. A recent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/31/donald-trump-mexico-meeting-president-pena-nieto-immigration\">meeting with the Mexican president</a>, however, made clear that this is highly unlikely. Trump appeared to mislead supporters almost immediately afterward and continues to ignore evidence that Mexican net migration into the US has dropped to near zero in recent years. The mechanics of his deportation policy are even vaguer.</p> <p><strong>Is there anyone you regret offending?<br></strong>An open question that could lead Trump into uncharted territory. For over a year, the Republican nominee has outraged Muslims, African Americans, women, Latinos and disabled people with a series of ever-more outrageous comments. Any attempt to hold him to account for offensive language was dismissed as mere political correctness. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/07/humayun-khan-donald-trump-military-arlington-national-cemetery\">Attacking the family of a Muslim war hero</a> after the Democratic convention finally seemed to damage Trump in the polls, though, and prompted a half-apology. Who else will he say sorry to?</p> <p><strong>What evidence do you have against climate change?<br></strong>Like many Republicans, Trump has repeatedly suggested that action to prevent man-made climate change is unnecessary because he does not \u201cbelieve\u201d it is real. He is even <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/21/politics/scientists-open-letter-trump-climate-change/\">threatening to pull the US out of the Paris climate accord</a>. Yet in the face of overwhelming evidence from world scientists, surely the onus is now on skeptics to prove their claims with facts and numbers of their own.

  "<p>Donald Trump walked on to the biggest stage of his life with nothing but upside ahead.</p> <p>After the most undisciplined campaign in living memory, Trump was always going to look bigger by standing on a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/27/debate-clinton-trump-recap-presidential-election-hofstra\">presidential debate stage</a>. He could spar with a former secretary of state on an equal footing.</p> <p>To paraphrase George W Bush, Trump thrives on the soft bigotry of low expectations. All he had to do was avoid tripping over his shoelaces. Instead he somehow contrived to blow his biggest moment, and all the credibility accrued by steadily gaining ground in the polls over the last several weeks.</p> <p>Just like his convention speech, Trump ran a gamut of emotions from angry to aggravated. He <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/26/trump-sniffles-presidential-debate-clinton-hofstra\">sniffed</a> and he snorted. He took every piece of bait Clinton dangled out there \u2013 from sideswipes about his father\u2019s business to his support for the war in Iraq.</p> <p>He sounded more like a heckler at a Clinton speech than a presidential candidate asking for votes.

Pressed by moderator Lester Holt on his initial support for the war in Iraq, Trump explained that he had \u201cvery lightly\u201d supported the war in an interview with Howard Stern. Or as he put it, \u201cWho knows?\u201d Then he detailed several conversations with Sean Hannity, a Fox News host who has recently taped a TV commercial on his behalf. But apparently \u201cnobody wants to call him\u201d which is a shame because Sean could totally clear this whole thing up.</p> <p>In any case, as the GOP nominee put it, he\u2019s just a lot better at this whole president thing than Hillary Clinton. At least, that\u2019s what it sounded like.

She pretended to loosen her shoulders but frankly the rest of the world remains in need of a deep tissue massage.</p> <p>For her part, Clinton appeared to be interviewing for something like commander-in-chief. When Trump once again suggested he would only defend allies if they paid him for the privilege, Clinton turned to the camera to address a fearful planet.</p> <p>\u201cI know that this campaign has caused some questioning and some worries on the part of many leaders across the globe,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve talked with a number of them. But I want to, on behalf of myself and I think on behalf of a majority of the American people say that, you know, our word is good.\u201d</p> <p>Trump, by the way, has also talked to world leaders. \u201cI met with Bibi Netanyahu,\u201d he explained. \u201cHe\u2019s not a happy camper.\u201d</p> <p>It would be wrong to say that Trump had no good moments in this first encounter. He voiced popular dismay with manufacturing job losses and politicians in general. He conceded that people on the no-fly list of terrorist suspects should not be able to purchase guns, and he reminded voters that his opponent had talked of some criminals as \u201csuper-predators\u201d.</p> <p>But then the debate turned to the pesky question of his obsession with Barack Obama\u2019s birthplace, years after the White House released the full birth certificate. And Trump lost the plot, as well as his intended audience.</p> <p>Clinton cast what she called \u201cthe whole racist birther lie\u201d as part of a pattern stretching back to his early career in real estate when he was sued for racial discrimination. Trump\u2019s response was to blame Clinton for the birther debate, before insisting that he was just one of many developers sued for discrimination. Besides, he bragged, he developed property in Palm Beach, Florida, that could prove his bona fides on race. \u201cI opened a club and really got great credit for it,\u201d he said. \u201cNo discrimination against African Americans, against Muslims, against anybody.\u201d</p> <p>It was widely reported that Trump did not prepare for this evening season with policy briefings or mock sessions with aides. Instead he clearly prepped for the big night by reviewing his own LinkedIn profile. </p> <p>This was clearly no ordinary debate. That was obvious from the outset, when the candidates\u2019 families and friends walked out as bold-face names: Bill Clinton, Ivanka Trump, Mark Cuban and Vernon Jordan. The audience cheered and hollered, clapped and booed, unlike the normally tightly controlled presidential debates of contests gone by.</p> <p>In any ordinary election year, by any rational measure, you would say that Hillary Clinton trounced Donald Trump in their first debate. She was in command of her facts and her soundbites; he could only cite numbers about his own cash-to-debt ratio. She controlled the pace of the debate; he could barely control his temper. She talked about how she wanted to govern; he talked about her inferior stamina. The more important question is whether the majority of voters in November are in anything like a rational mood. </p> <p>This may be a year when rational Americans stay at home, disillusioned with the spectacle of two older politicians squabbling over emails and tax returns. If Trump is right, voters are mad as hell and aren\u2019t going to take this any more. In which case, they have found a candidate who demonstrated he\u2019s just as mad as they are.<br></p>",

A direct line was, at that time, simply out of the question, owing to the national phone number shortage. You may think I\u2019m making this up but I\u2019m not.

As I was making numerous calls that day, this gave me less reassurance than I sought. Yet I was, and remain, very struck by the response. This was clearly someone who, for much of the day, answered the phone to students wanting to know the time of a lecture or to ask for an essay extension, or to a friendly local trader following up an invoice. It was not a voice expecting, say, an offer of an exciting new opportunity, not that this was what was on my mind either. The mix of local civic pride and narrow horizons left a deep impression on me.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/video/2016/sep/22/oxford-university-vice-chancellor-research-funding-brexit-audio\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/546aq\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2740607\"            data-video-name=\"Oxford vice chancellor worried about post-Brexit funding \u2013\u00a0audio\"            data-video-provider=\"BBC Radio 4/TODAY \"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57e3afe0e4b011f2eb7120d9\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/09/22/160922radio4richardson_KP-29359875_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/09/22/160922radio4richardson_KP-29359875.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/09/22/160922radio4richardson_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/video/2016/sep/22/oxford-university-vice-chancellor-research-funding-brexit-audio\">Oxford vice-chancellor worried about post-Brexit funding \u2013 audio</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>And it is an impression that has returned in post-referendum, immigration-control Britain.

Consider <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/25/britain-universities-depend-openness-dont-let-brexit-destroy-it\">staff recruitment</a>. Whether or not there are formal restrictions, the changing atmosphere will not be good for attracting the international staff that characterise highly successful departments. Universities often talk about bringing in the \u201cworld\u2019s best\u201d but that can\u2019t really be the aim. After all, there are not enough of the very best to go round. What we need is to bring in staff who are both excellent and rather different from what we already have, to refresh the gene pool and protect against complacency. At the moment we reap the benefit of having one of the most open academic job markets in the world.</p> <p>Internationalisation of UK universities over the past few decades has been staggering, especially at postgraduate student level. To give a sense of the proportions, in <a href=\"https://www.hesa.ac.uk/data-and-analysis/publications/students-2014-15/introduction\">2014-15</a>, 71% of full-time master\u2019s level students and more than half of PhD students came from overseas. This now makes it impossible to sustain our present university system on the basis of demand from home students alone. Falling demand will mean course closures, and perhaps even the closure of universities, most likely in those parts of the country that can least afford it, where the university is a major employer.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/aug/02/academics-brexit-research-peat-fears-eu-funds\">Academics feel blight of Brexit \u2013 from cancer research to peat projects</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And if the overseas students cannot come to the UK, where will they go? Well, as they tell you at business school, today\u2019s customer is tomorrow\u2019s competition. Universities around the world, especially in the EU, have significant numbers of staff who were educated in the UK, and are fully capable of providing an innovative curriculum in English. In time UK universities would have felt this pressure in any case, but government policy promises our competitors a rosy future.</p> <p>The apparent silver lining, I suppose, is that slackening of demand will make it easier for the rising generation of UK students to get the place of their choice. The cloud, though, is that when they get there, they will find even the best universities to be less interesting, diverse and dynamic places than they may have been expecting.</p>",
  "<p>It\u2019s important, sometimes, to get back to basics. Given the debate about schools funding launched by the government, it\u2019s timely to look again at the reasons Labor asked David Gonski and his expert panel to undertake a review into our schools in the first place.</p> <p>We did it because we wanted a thorough, systemic analysis of how we could be sure every Australian child got the best possible education.</p> <p>What did the Gonski review conclude? That to get a great education every child should receive the Schooling Resource Standard, which we set at $9,271 for every primary school and $12,193 for every high school child.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/24/commonwealth-v-states-gonski-schoolyard-fight-is-just-getting-started\">Commonwealth v states: Gonski schoolyard fight is just getting started | Gabrielle Chan</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Children from a low socioeconomic background, with limited English, Indigenous children and those attending small, rural or remote schools, would attract extra funds.</p> <p>Along with this came the National Plan for School Improvement, because Labor always knew that extra money had to come with a clear plan to lift performance.</p> <p>Labor also introduced an unprecedented national testing and transparency plan, so that we could pick up children who were falling behind much earlier, and put extra resources in to make sure we helped those children as early as possible in their schooling. We could also learn what was working and not working in school communities, so our whole system could continuously improve.</p> <p>This is the plan that Simon Birmingham has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/21/coalition-to-argue-labors-school-funding-deals-a-corruption-of-gonski-report\">desperately insisting this week that the government supports</a>.</p> <p>Yet in every respect, he is arguing for the opposite.</p> <p>He doesn\u2019t want to reach the Schooling Resource Standard.</p> <p>He doesn\u2019t really want to give schools extra for kids with extra needs.</p> <p>On Monday night <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/27/qa-simon-birmingham-says-overfunded-schools-could-lose-money-under-gonski-overhaul\">we heard him say that some schools are \u201coverfunded\u201d</a> but he\u2019s not prepared to say which ones.</p> <p>And while he plays a blame game, trying to distract from the government\u2019s plan to defund schools, he seems to have conveniently forgotten his own party\u2019s record.</p> <p>The former education minister Christopher Pyne slashed schools funding then got rid of the requirement that states and territories increase their own funding along with increases in federal funds. Pyne dismissed the requirement to improve standards in our schools as just red tape.</p> <p>We know investing in our kids\u2019 schooling is the best thing we can do to build future prosperity.</p> <p>But the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development says there\u2019s a big equity gap in Australian schools. The most disadvantaged kids are falling further and further behind.</p> <p>That\u2019s not just bad for those individual children, it\u2019s a drag on our economic growth as a nation.</p> <p>Labor made the tough calls on budget reform to find savings such as changes to the tobacco excise and reducing superannuation concessions for millionaires to fund the extra money needed for our schools. The government says we can\u2019t afford the extra funding, yet it wants to go ahead with its $50bn tax cut for big business, which most economists believe will do significantly less for our productivity as a nation than Labor\u2019s plan for school improvement.</p> <p>The government is out and about this week playing the blame game and picking fights with the states and territories to distract from its plan to effectively scrap needs-based funding.

  "<h2>1. Children\u2019s hospices are where children go to die</h2> <p>Although some children go to a hospice and die shortly afterwards, there are many more who are known to staff over several years. Hospices are also often used to give parents some respite from looking after a child with a life-limiting condition. \u201cPeople often assume that all we do is end-of-life care,\u201d says Clare Periton, chief executive of <a href=\"http://www.helenanddouglas.org.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Helen &amp; Douglas House</a>. \u201cSometimes we meet a terminally-ill child and only look after them for three days. Other times, we meet a young man who\u2019s been diagnosed with a degenerative disease and we\u2019ll know him for 20 years.\u201d</p> <h2>2. They are sad, depressing places to work</h2> <p>On walking into a hospice, many people say it\u2019s not how they imagined it would be. Perhaps it\u2019s something to do with the fun, laughter and activities that go on. There are play and music therapists on hand as well as animal visits. Heather Tilley, therapies manager at <a href=\"https://www.shootingstarchase.org.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Shooting Star Chase</a>, remembers one occasion when a donkey visited a child in her bedroom because she was too ill to get up. </p> <p>Periton adds that they hold themed weekends, Oscar\u2019s nights, and arrange trips out to the pub and bowling for the young people at Helen &amp; Douglas House. \u201cWhen I tell people about my job, they say it must be so sad,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s not. It\u2019s a place of laughter and life. A massive part of what we do is enable people to live the lives they want in the time they have left.\u201d </p> <p>Tony Judd, a specialist carer at <a href=\"http://www.noahsarkhospice.org.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Noah\u2019s Ark children\u2019s hospice</a>, agrees: \u201cIt can be sad but most of the time, we\u2019re making happy memories. There are way more positives than there are negatives.\u201d</p> <h2>3. Children have no say over how they are treated</h2> <p>The child is involved whenever they can be and their wishes are always taken into consideration. Sometimes young people want to revise for their GCSEs, or go bowling, or get their symptoms sorted out because they are fed up of pain, and so treatment plans are tweaked accordingly. </p> <p>Judd says: \u201cWe want children to make as many decisions as to what\u2019s going on as possible and to be able to do as much as they can. If they\u2019re capable of making decisions, we\u2019ll involve them as much as possible. When children aren\u2019t able, we can communicate in other ways and pick up on what they like.\u201d</p> <h2>4. Children are not able to talk about death and what matters to them</h2> <p>Unlike adults, children are much more pragmatic and open when it comes to talking about death. Periton remembers one time when some siblings came in to the hospice. They were both bouncing on space hoppers, when one asked the other when their brother died. Upon hearing the answer, he replied: \u201cMy brother\u2019s deader than yours\u201d. She says: \u201cChildren are really frank about it \u2026 We have a cold room where children go when they\u2019ve died \u2013 it\u2019s right in the middle of Douglas House because that\u2019s where [the young people] wanted it.\u201d She says there have been examples of children wanting to give birthday presents early in case the recipient or they aren\u2019t still alive on the day.</p> <p>Older children often talk to counsellors in hospices about what they are going through. Tilley says: \u201cFor a young person that might be a difficult conversation with their parents and friends. Often in families, there\u2019s a need to protect each other so they won\u2019t talk about how they\u2019re feeling \u2026 They might express fears, concern about how people might manage after they\u2019ve died.\u201d</p> <h2>5. Working in a hospice is not rewarding</h2> <p>Tilley says: \u201cIt\u2019s a privilege to do the work we do because you\u2019re working with people at a difficult time in their life.\u201d She remembers one moment that brought home how rewarding her job can be. \u201cI worked with a couple whose eight-month old baby had died and they asked how life could continue and that they couldn\u2019t imagine carrying on. I worked with them over a matter of months and [some time afterwards] they came back into the hospice with their new baby. That was a reward. You don\u2019t get over something; your life grows around the grief.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/careers/careers-blog/six-myths-social-care-sector\">Six myths about the social care sector</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>6. Support from children\u2019s hospices does not extend to the family</h2> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s never just the child,\u201d says Periton. \u201cYou\u2019re looking after the whole family for a period of time.\u201d At Shooting Star Chase, Tilley works with the parents and siblings of a child. \u201cA lot of our work will be around the loss of expectations, that you\u2019re going to outlive your child,\u201d Judd adds: \u201cWe\u2019re there for the child but you can\u2019t not be involved with the family. When you\u2019re in their home and going in once a week, you become part of the family and the furniture. I want them to feel they can trust me and treat me like they\u2019re comfortable with me. We include siblings in play, we have family days and involve them as much as possible.\u201d</p> <h2>7. Children\u2019s hospices are part of the NHS and receive government funding</h2> <p>Hospices are charities and are almost entirely funded by donations from the community. They have fundraising teams to raise money. They typically receive less than 20% funding from the NHS and local authorities.</p> <h2>8. Most children in hospices have cancer</h2> <p>At Helen &amp; Douglas House, Periton says about 15% of the children have cancer. Other life-limiting or threatening illnesses include heart conditions, neurological degenerative illnesses such as muscular dystrophy, all sorts of unusual genetic diseases and metabolic problems. The range of problems is much wider than those encountered in the adult hospice world.</p> <p><strong>Looking for a job?

Fox <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/12/theresa-may-declines-to-endorse-liam-fox-attack-on-fat-and-lazy-uk-firms\">was told off for saying British firms were too \u201cfat and lazy\u201d</a> to be any good at exporting.</p> <p>So it was really only a matter of time for Boris. In an interview in New York, he told Sky News that Britain would trigger article 50 and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/22/boris-johnson-uk-aiming-start-eu-brexit-talks-early-2017\">begin the formal two-year process of leaving the EU \u201cby the early part of next year\u201d</a>. </p> <p>No 10 declined to back him, saying pointedly that the government\u2019s position \u201chas not changed\u201d: in other words, article 50 won\u2019t be triggered before the end of 2016, and beyond that we\u2019re saying nothing. </p> <p>The incident prompted the satirical website the Daily Mash to report <a href=\"http://www.thedailymash.co.uk/politics/politics-headlines/theresa-may-appoints-minister-for-contradicting-brexit-ministers-20160923114288\">that May had now appointed a minister \u201cspecifically charged with denying all statements by the ministers in charge of Brexit\u201d</a>.</p> <p>Johnson also said Brexit, which he reckoned could take less than two years, would allow Britain \u201cto benefit from fantastic opportunities for greater free trade with our friends in the EU\u201d (he did not say how) and repeated his view that Britain could have its cake and eat it: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>They\u2019d have us believe there\u2019s some automatic trade-off between what they call access to the single market and free movement.

  "<p>China is the world\u2019s deadliest country for outdoor air pollution, according to analysis by the World Health Organisation (WHO).</p> <p>The UN agency has previously warned that tiny particulates from cars, power plants and other sources <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/mar/25/air-pollution-kills-7m-people-a-year\">are killing 3 million people worldwide each year</a>.</p> <p>For the first time the WHO has broken down that figure to a country-by-country level. It reveals that of the worst three nations, more than 1 million people died from dirty air in China in 2012, at least 600,000 in India and more than 140,000 in Russia.<br></p> <p>At 25th out of 184 countries with data, the UK ranks worse than France, with 16,355 deaths in 2012 versus 10,954, but not as poorly as Germany at 26,160, which has more industry and 16 million more people. Australia had 94 deaths and 38,043 died in the US that year from particulate pollution.<br></p> <p>Maria Neria, director of the WHO\u2019s public health and the environment department, told the Guardian: \u201cCountries are confronted with the reality of better data. Now we have the figures of how many citizens are dying from air pollution. What we are learning is, this is very bad. Now there are no excuses for not taking action.\u201d</p> <p>Gavin Shaddick, who led the international team that put together the data, said: \u201cGlobally, air pollution presents a major risk to public health and a substantial number of lives could be saved if levels of air pollution were reduced.\u201d<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/tools/tables/embed/index.html?spreadsheet=1AoFGZhUCkh2lmJ2IDunnxTV-TQvmWSlfYQxbMJ-OJQA\" data-alt=\"Deaths attributable to ambient air pollution\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/tools/tables/embed/index.html?spreadsheet=1AoFGZhUCkh2lmJ2IDunnxTV-TQvmWSlfYQxbMJ-OJQA\">Deaths attributable to ambient air pollution</a> </figure>  <p>Sixteen scientists from eight international institutions worked with WHO on the analysis, which gathered data from 3,000 locations, using pollution monitors on the ground, modelling and satellite readings. </p> <p>They looked at exposure to tiny particulates 2.5 microns in size, known as PM2.5s, which penetrate the lungs and are the air pollutant most strongly associated with an increased risk of death. \u201cThe real driver of ill health is ultra-fine particles, 2.5s \u2013 they have the ability to permeate the membrane of the lungs and enter our blood system,\u201d said Shaddick, who is based at the University of Bath. \u201cIncreasingly there is an understanding that there are not just respiratory diseases but cardiovascular ones associated with PM2.5s.\u201d</p> <p>In the UK more than 90% of the population lives in areas with levels of PM2.5s above the WHO\u2019s air-quality limits of 10 micrograms per cubic metre for the annual mean. The government is in the high court on 18 and 19 October facing a legal challenge by environmental law group ClientEarth, which says ministers\u2019 clean-up plans for another pollutant \u2013 nitrogen dioxide \u2013 are inadequate.</p> <p>Globally, 92% of the population breathes air that breaches WHO limits but the world map of deaths caused by PM2.5s changes when looked at per capita. When ranked by the number of deaths for every 100,000 people, Ukraine jumps to the top of the list at 120. </p> <p>It is followed by eastern European and former Soviet states, and Russia itself, probably due to a legacy of heavy industry in the region. China drops down to 10th, at 76 per 100,000, and India falls to 27th, with 49 per 100,000.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/sep/2016-09-26T13:39:55/embed.html\" data-alt=\"Worst and cleanest countries per capita\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/sep/2016-09-26T13:39:55/embed.html\">Worst and cleanest countries per capita</a> </figure>  <p>Most of the air pollution comes from cars, coal-fired plants and waste burning but not all of it is created by humans.

That\u2019s something we in the west can\u2019t even comprehend. That was probably a bit of a shock [to me].\u201d</p> <p>The Pacific states of Brunei Darussalam, Fiji and Vanuatu have the lowest number of deaths from air pollution, the WHO found.<br></p> <p>Anne Hidalgo, mayor of Paris and chair-elect of a network of cities combating climate change, said: \u201cFighting pollution is one of my top priorities as mayor of Paris. It is a vital public health issue and all mayors should take on their responsibility to deliver bold actions.\u201d</p> <p>The city of Paris voted on Monday to ban cars along a stretch of the river Seine to cut pollution, defeating a minority rightwing opposition.<br></p> <p>Hidalgo added: \u201cI have said it before and am saying it again: we cannot negotiate with Parisians\u2019 health.\u201d</p> <p>Neira said Canada and Scandinavian countries deserved praise for curbing air pollution and singled out France too. \u201cFrance is taking a lot of action, Paris is taking aggressive measures: aggressive in the good sense. [It] maybe unpopular because it\u2019s for the health of people but they are putting some restrictions on individuals. We all need to understand this is a matter of public health,\u201d she said.</p>",

But now the number of people coming to clubs has reduced because nobody wants embarrassment from the security at checkpoints.\u201d</p> <p>Nightlife is now returning. The Sahara nightclub on the edge of the city is seeing its numbers swell. \u201cPeople troop in a lot,\u201d Yuguda said. \u201cEspecially on Wednesdays and Fridays, when women get free entry. We play music till 2am or 3am again.\u201d</p> <p>Sally Hayden, an Irish journalist who was reporting from Maiduguri in May, said she saw patrons start \u201cclubbing on Saturday afternoon so they have enough time before the curfew. Others opt to stay until sunrise the next day.\u201d</p> <p>Younger clubbers go to Hot Bites, a stone\u2019s throw away from the heavily guarded palatial residence of the former state governor Ali Modu Sheriff. There, urged on by pop music from Tekno, Wizkid and Mr Eazi, young Christian men dance with Kanuri and Shuwa Muslim women, a scene that offers a different view of a city usually described in news reports as \u201cthe frontier of [African] jihad\u201d.</p> <p>Though the state of Borno is largely conservative and Muslim, like anywhere in the world, young people have found a way to break rules set down by their parents.<br></p> <p>Khadeejah, 21, a recent graduate of Maiduguri University, who gave only her first name, regularly goes clubbing. \u201cMany of the girls here told their parents they are having sleepovers with their female friends,\u201d she said. \u201cThen they come clubbing and change to more revealing outfits that they drop somewhere within the premises.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"c00ca0cfb52a600bbecdfa268e51b0bac579afb8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c00ca0cfb52a600bbecdfa268e51b0bac579afb8/0_221_5184_3110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A dance competition at Sanda Kyarimi zoo in Maiduguri, as people enjoy the first Eid al-Adha with no no curfew.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A dance competition at Sanda Kyarimi zoo in Maiduguri, as people enjoy the first Eid al-Adha with no curfew.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fati Abubakar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Khadeejah and her friend Falmata, 24, begin the weekend with a trip to buy drugs for the partying ahead. \u201cYou have to be high before you go and club,\u201d said Falmata. </p> <p>In August, the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency in Borno state announced that it had <a href=\"https://www.bellanaija.com/2016/08/ndlea-seizes-20-tonnes-of-illicit-drugs-from-87-suspects-in-borno/\">confiscated 20 tonnes of drugs </a>in Maiduguri over two years, a figure exacerbated by the 22 nearby camps for internally displaced people, where drug use is also prevalent. </p> <p>For this reason, Thierry Laurent-Badin, the director of programmes for humanitarian food aid group Action Contre la Faim, is cautious about proclaiming that the city is back on its feet.<br></p> <p>\u201cWhile Maiduguri seems, on the surface, to be slowly getting back to life, it is important to understand that the city\u2019s population has more than doubled over the past four years,\u201d he said. \u201cThe related trauma of displacement will have a long-lasting impact on individuals and communities.\u201d He said much of the population was \u201cextremely vulnerable to exploitation.\u201d</p> <p>But Abubakar stressed that for the first time in years, there were no attacks on the Eid al-Adha celebrations in September, which had a profound effect on local people. </p> <p>\u201cThis year was a beautiful experience, because for the first time in years, there was no shutdown of the town for fear of attacks, so people were very excited, especially children,\u201d Abubakar said.</p>",

Post-Tinder, love feels disposable; people become something to consume. This is what love online looks like.</p> <h2>\u2018I asked the first guy out after exchanging three sentences\u2019<br></h2> <p><strong>Libby, 27, customer services assistant</strong></p> <p>In January this year I downloaded Tinder, Bumble and Happn. It seemed like the only option to meet someone these days if you don\u2019t work with, or hang out with, men. </p> <p>I asked the first guy out after exchanging approximately three sentences on Tinder. He announced he was emigrating the moment we met. I realised we were mismatched after approximately three minutes, anyway. He now lives in New York; I stayed in the country.</p> <p>One evening I got chatting to someone: skip forward three hours and I had agreed to meet him in central London. I stumbled up the stairs at Oxford Circus, spotted his bad shoes and realised that I just wasn\u2019t Samantha from Sex and the City. I promptly ran across the road and down another entrance, and texted him to say: \u201cI\u2019m so sorry something has come up, I can\u2019t make it tonight.\u201d He sent me a lovely response that it was totally OK and we should go for a drink another night.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/nov/07/-sp-10-best-dating-apps\">10 dating apps to get your love life back on track</a> </p> </aside>  <p>We did. He had just been diagnosed with <a href=\"http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder/Pages/Introduction.aspx\">ADHD</a> and they were experimenting with his medication, which tended to wear off at the end of the day, so he didn\u2019t like to sit still for too long. But I really liked how weird he was and was totally thrilled when he texted me the next morning: \u201cThat was fun, we should do it again some time.\u201d We did; three days later he hadn\u2019t texted me. A week later, I was drunk and I sent him a meme of <a href=\"http://www.eonline.com/uk/news/778827/celine-dion-proves-her-heart-will-still-go-on-with-an-885-titanic-hoodie\">Celine Dion letting go of Leonardo DiCaprio in Titanic</a> whispering, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kog1IduEvtg\">\u201cJack, I\u2019ll never let go, Jack\u201d</a> because his name was Jack and I thought I was hilarious.</p> <p>The worst part of online dating is the first awkward face-to-face hello. Your preconception of the person you have been speaking to is always very oddly different to whoever it is you meet. And I also seem to make my mind up very quickly on how the night will go.</p> <p>I once heard a story about a man who turns up to dates early and buys himself a drink, so that when the girl arrives, he can send her up to the bar to get a drink and do a runner if he thinks they aren\u2019t up to his exacting standards. That\u2019s almost a reason to give up.</p> <p>One evening, I started speaking to a man \u2013 really interesting, engaging, all very effortless \u2013 and after three hours of constant messaging, we arranged a drink for the next day. He asked for my number \u2013 taking messaging off Tinder is a big deal \u2013 and then texted at 5pm to ask me where we should go. I texted back suggesting a bar, washed my hair and never heard back from him.</p> <p>Many, many people agree to a drink and then never reply. I\u2019m almost not sure how to deal with any response to \u201cDo you want to discuss this over a drink?\u201d that isn\u2019t silence. One guy asked me which person I was in one of my profile pictures; he said my friend looked like a much hotter version of me. I replied, \u201cOh, really?\u201d He said, \u201cYou\u2019re an angry woman, you would fall in love with me but also hate me a little bit. I bet you would slap me during sex.\u201d We went on two average dates.</p> <p>I have never been on a Bumble date. It is rumoured the app has a hotter population of men. But it doesn\u2019t actually put the female in control: it simply means vain men can read and smugly ignore your overthought openers. Happn is trying to add the cute \u201cfate\u201d dimension to app dating, but it just means you find your flatmate\u2019s boyfriend on it as he is upstairs and the location tracker lands you in a dubious situation. I deleted it on Valentine\u2019s Day.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2a520e583bb4f2c9f83f994f9b5427fc090a965f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2a520e583bb4f2c9f83f994f9b5427fc090a965f/307_314_2115_1268/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Illustration by Nishant Choksi\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Illustration by Nishant Choksi</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Nishant Choksi</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A friend of mine commented that no one hooks up with anyone on a night out any more. I reckon this is due to everyone prearranging their hook-ups on apps. Spontaneity can be overrated.</p> <p>I recently went on a date with a guy I met at a friend\u2019s wedding. He complimented me on my dress; a face-to-face compliment means so much more than something throwaway over an app. We went on a date once we were both back from the wedding and, frankly, it was less than average, but I definitely pinned a lot of hope on it because I had met him \u201cin real life\u201d.</p> <p>Yes, dating apps can be funny and the stories are great, but if I do manage to marry a man, I would be disappointed if my husband\u2019s best man said, \u201cI still remember when he saw her profile on Tinder\u201d in his speech. It gives you a thick skin but it still has a stigma attached to it and I\u2019m envious of those who found love pre-apps.</p> <h2>\u2018One guy on Tinder had a great bio: fought a shark, lost an arm\u2019<br></h2> <p><strong>Jack, 26, freelance copywriter </strong></p> <p>I started using Tinder as soon as I broke up with my ex of four years, in January this year. I always thought it sounded fun so didn\u2019t waste any time. I stayed away from Grindr as, very sadly, a man was murdered in a block of flats near my work on a Grindr date and it spooked me.</p> <p>I am very much a Tinder man. I have only had one bad date on Tinder out of maybe 12. And even then it wasn\u2019t awful, the guy just thought his job in security was interesting when it wasn\u2019t, plus he was on his phone quite a bit. The others were all really nice but I only really felt a spark with a couple.</p> <p>The weirdest date I\u2019ve ever been on was a guy whose house I turned up at a bit drunk, which wasn\u2019t really my finest hour, and when I went to the loo I found in the toilet bowl the passport and wallet of a guy he had just been making out with. We ended up dating for three months and really got on. It probably would have lasted longer but I think we were a bit of a personality clash.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5fd2b19de47e3382bedaf24888fd863ecb3af54f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5fd2b19de47e3382bedaf24888fd863ecb3af54f/0_771_1663_998/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Illustration by Nishant Choksi\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Illustration by Nishant Choksi</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Nishant Choksi</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There was another guy on Tinder with one arm who I matched with and he had a great bio. \u201cNot the best at juggling (fought a shark, lost an arm)\u201d. I think he may have lost in it an actual shark attack.</p> <p>Since being single I haven\u2019t been asked out once in real life. But maybe that\u2019s because we\u2019re all on Tinder now. I think it\u2019s harder when you\u2019re gay because you can really fancy someone but it can be quite embarrassing to ask someone out, then they turn out to be straight. So Tinder is nice in that respect \u2013 you can be sure the dudes you like are at least into dudes, even if they\u2019re not into you.</p> <p>The trick is to assume that the ugliest photo he sends is the truest representation. After all, we all try to present the most attractive profiles of ourselves. From experience, it\u2019s also a good idea to avoid freelance models.</p> <p>I think people are a bit more dismissive on Tinder dates than they would be if they were with a friend of a friend or someone they had met in a bar \u2013 although seriously, does that ever happen? If there isn\u2019t a spark you don\u2019t feel any obligation to immediately say, \u201cI had a really nice time but I didn\u2019t think we quite clicked.\u201d Whereas you might if you thought you would see them again. Tinder becomes a numbers game; the more people you meet the more likely you think you are to find \u201cthe one\u201d.</p> <h2>\u2018My date arrived 40 minutes late, clearly drop-down drunk\u2019<br></h2> <p><strong>Katherine, 28, social worker</strong></p> <p>I used to meet girls in real life, but as I\u2019ve got older, and lesbian spaces in London have become fewer and, frankly, grottier, I\u2019ve found it more convenient to meet women online. Over the past few years, I\u2019ve dabbled with various dating apps. I\u2019ve tried OKCupid and Happn without much luck (they\u2019re too alternative, or hetero). At points I\u2019ve paid for a <a href=\"https://soulmates.theguardian.com\">Guardian Soulmates</a> subscription, which admittedly attracts a higher calibre of lesbian, but the pool of women seeking women is a small one. Mostly, I use Tinder. I know no other app where it\u2019s possible to make four dates for the coming week in under an hour \u2013 it can be fun.</p> <p>Online dating has delivered some very random and entertaining evenings. I have gone on dates that have led to flings and friendships, and that have introduced me to new parts of London, and places to go out. The highlight so far was definitely sharing a boozy evening with a pretty famous and rather attractive comedian. That\u2019s one of the real, sincere joys of online dating \u2013 it can open your world up to people who you would never ordinarily get the chance to meet, let alone snog. Unfortunately, I became a bit star-struck. She declined a second date and \u2013 according to Twitter \u2013 promptly got back together with her boyfriend. Nonetheless, I still feel secretly smug when I see her on television.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"048d0f8501031740a6f84d1b91544c848d851a8e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/048d0f8501031740a6f84d1b91544c848d851a8e/0_39_1629_1694/962.jpg\" alt=\"Illustration by Nishant Choksi\" width=\"962\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Illustration by Nishant Choksi</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Nishant Choksi</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But obviously, online dating isn\u2019t all snogging celebrities, and there have been wasted and demoralising evenings along the way. One of my worst online dates took place shortly after the break-up of a relationship. I was feeling pretty down about being back on Tinder, and had to really force myself to get out there. Having been out of the dating game for some time, I had made a greater than usual effort getting ready, and had booked us a table at an expensive bar. My date arrived 40 minutes late and was clearly drop-down drunk. She started a bizarre, slurred argument with the waitress who had \u2013 fairly \u2013 given our table away, and I cut out of there, feeling despondent and very, very sober.</p> <p>I had one relationship that lasted for a year. She introduced me to the east London lesbian scene when I first moved to London. She was a bit older than me. We met on Soulmates. We almost moved in together but I think I was probably a bit too young in the end. It ended, but amicably.</p> <p>I haven\u2019t really received any nasty messages, but I was once chatting to a \u201cgirl\u201d for a few days who I think was probably a guy. This person wanted to talk about sex a lot, but went very quiet when it came to meeting up. I\u2019ve also ended up chatting to girls for days, only to discover that all they\u2019re really looking for is a third person.</p> <p>Despite some setbacks, online dating has generally delivered a pleasing source of distraction and periodic amusement. Nonetheless, I do wonder if having constant access to so many potential partners is such a good thing. Such opportunity seems to mean that there are fewer incentives to see what happens when you do meet someone you like, and to stick with it when it gets hard. I confess I have been guilty of thinking, \u201cWell, she\u2019s nice, but Camden is a bit far away,\u201d from time to time. I do have a few friends who have found lasting relationships online, so I suppose for the time being I\u2019ll keep on swiping and wait and see.</p>",

Look at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2015/sep/28/labour-conference-john-mcdonnells-economy-speech-politics-live\">John McDonnell\u2019s strong speech on the economy</a>, which does promise so much I would support, and little in principle I would disagree with \u2013 from a higher minimum wage, to taxing the avoiders and investing in industry. So why not?</p> <p>My answers sound cynical, worldly and unworthy in the face of this surge of belief. Why not? Because Corbyn and McDonnell, burdened by their history, will never ever earn the trust of enough voters to make any plans happen. After George <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/mar/17/budget-2015-osborne-austerity-labour-miliband-wavering-voters\">Osborne\u2019s lethally successful branding of Labour</a> as irresponsible, debt-ridden, magic-money-tree feckless borrowers, it will take heavy spadework of reassurance to win back trust. All McDonnell\u2019s plans are popular, but he offers nothing to allay the voters\u2019 fear that Labour doesn\u2019t do \u201ctough choices\u201d.</p> <p>At one conference meeting when a speaker said Labour must win some Tory votes, someone shouted out: \u201cWhy? We don\u2019t want Tories!\u201d So I find myself arguing dry psephology against passionate conviction. It\u2019s depressing, but here\u2019s the <a href=\"http://www.fabians.org.uk/under-corbyns-electoral-plan-prospects-for-victory-look-bleak/\">Fabian Society\u2019s analysis</a>: Labour needs 104 seats in England and Wales and 40% of the vote to win. In the marginals, four out every five of the extra votes must come from those who were Tory last time. Even if the young are energised and turnout soars to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/sep/21/scottish-referendum-massive-voter-turnout-means-politics-changed-for-ever\">Scottish referendum heights</a>, it gets nowhere close. Even if every single Liberal Democrat and Green vote went Labour, that only gives 29 seats. Even if Ukip were crushed, its vote divides equally Labour and Tory. As Labour wins radical votes, it risks losing moderate votes to the Tories: 2% went that way last time. Read the research yourself and groan. It hurts.</p> <p>In one fraught conversation after another, I try all this on Corbyn believers but to no avail. No compromise, blocked ears, total denial of electoral facts, a post-truth conviction. You can hear this non-meeting of minds everywhere at this conference, a shutter of incomprehension dividing the two sides. \u201cBut we can convince them! People will listen!\u201d They do think Corbyn will be the next prime minister, because conviction moves mountains.

  "<p>The first presidential debate is in the can. Here\u2019s a summary of what happened:<br></p> <ul> <li>Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump engaged in an occasionally <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/27/debate-clinton-trump-recap-presidential-election-hofstra\">raw series of clashes</a> on topics from trade policy to the Iran deal to Trump\u2019s taxes.</li> <li>The Republican candidate came out swinging on Nafta and on, he said, his Democratic rival\u2019s failed record of public service. His most aggressive attacks had Clinton appealing to \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/26/debate-fact-check-trump-clinton-live-quotes-hofstra\">fact-checkers</a>\u201d instead of offering rebuttals.</li> <li>Clinton\u2019s performance was magisterial. She slipped easily into the details of many policy areas \u2013 cyber warfare, community policing, paid family leave \u2013 that Trump could not touch.</li> <li>Clinton also scored the biggest moment of wit, at the end of a long Trump boast about his temperament, which he delivered hotly. \u201cWhew, OK!\u201d she said when he was through, smiling.</li> <li>Clinton flayed Trump on his refusal to release his tax returns, on his \u201clong record\u201d of \u201cracist behavior\u201d, on his lack of knowledge about the deal to withdraw US troops from Iraq, on climate change being a Chinese \u201choax\u201d, and on and on. But his best line was: \u201cHillary\u2019s got experience, but it\u2019s bad experience.\u201d</li> <li>Clinton\u2019s best line (apart from \u201cWhew, OK!\u201d): \u201cI think Donald just criticized me for preparing for this debate. And yes I did. And you know what else I prepared for? I prepared to be president. And that\u2019s a good thing.\u201d</li> <li>Clinton\u2019s runner-up best line, in reply to a Trump charge that \u201cwe don\u2019t have the money because it\u2019s been squandered on your ideas\u201d, was: \u201cMaybe it\u2019s because you haven\u2019t paid your taxes!\u201d</li> <li>There were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2016/sep/26/hillary-clinton-donald-trump-presidential-debate-live?page=with:block-57e9cf34e4b0a785ec48bcd8#liveblog-navigation\">lots of manterruptions</a>. Trump also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/26/trump-sniffles-presidential-debate-clinton-hofstra\">had the sniffles</a>.</li> <li>Trump lost altitude quickly after the first half hour, shifting from pointed interruptions to a more incoherent, sloppy pattern of interruption. </li> <li>Trump tried to deny five years of spreading birtherism \u2013 the conspiracy theory that Barack Obama was born outside the US. Clinton replied sharply: \u201cIt can\u2019t be dismissed that easily ... He has a long record in engaging in racist behavior.\u201d</li> <li>Trump cast doubt on the notion that the hacking of the Democratic National Committee was Russia-backed. He said it may have been China or, bizarrely, a \u201c400lb person sitting on their bed\u201d.</li> <li>Clinton said neighborhood security would come from community policing and getting guns off streets while Trump called for \u201claw and order\u201d and \u201cstop-and-frisk\u201d.</li> <li>Clinton poked fun at Trump\u2019s unlimited indictment of her record. \u201cI have a feeling that by the end of this evening everything is going to be my fault,\u201d she said. Then Trump agreed with her.</li> </ul>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ABCPolitics/status/780599581994209280\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">.<a href=\"https://twitter.com/HillaryClinton\">@HillaryClinton</a> after Trump&#39;s comment about her temperament: &quot;Whew!

His embrace of stop and frisk \u2013 and abrupt refusal to accept Lester Holt\u2019s word that the policy was ruled unconstitutional \u2013 was astonishing. His call for the restoration of \u201claw and order\u201d was a dated Nixon mantra, perhaps encouraged by Roger Ailes, who crafted the disgraced president\u2019s comeback nearly 50 years ago. He had no substantive rebuttals about his treatment of women or his clinging to the birther conspiracy that so insulted Barack Obama and the intelligence of American voters.</p> <p>As usual, Clinton showed command of policy, offered lots of sensible specifics but failed to provide an overarching theme for her candidacy.</p> <p>But if her intention was to let Trump asphyxiate himself, mission accomplished.</p> <p>I\u2019ve covered presidential debates since Gerald Ford disastrously said there was no communist domination of eastern Europe.

American voters, especially those struggling economically, don\u2019t like to see themselves as poor.

Donald Trump is accountable not just for what he gets wrong factually, but also what lurks beneath the surface of the thinly veiled sexist or xenophobic statements he traffics in.</p> <p>And tonight \u2013 in a moment that may end up a turning point not just in this debate, but also, perhaps, the election \u2013 Clinton not only managed to make the point but prove it.</p> <p>It occurred towards the end \u2013 a little less time and it never would have happened \u2013 when Trump was asked to explain what he meant by one of the more transparently sexist things he\u2019s said about Clinton: namely, that she doesn\u2019t look presidential. It was a delicate question, seemingly designed expressly to let Trump walk into a trap of his own making, but since Trump couldn\u2019t dodge it on substance, he obfuscated. \u201cI said she doesn\u2019t have the stamina,\u201d he said, before diverting the conversation down a rabbithole, calling into question the nature of Clinton\u2019s experience.</p> <p>It\u2019s true that Trump has also said she doesn\u2019t have the stamina, but it doesn\u2019t negate his more obviously sexist comment that she doesn\u2019t look presidential. And for once, Clinton didn\u2019t let the truth float away on a cloud of empty rhetoric.</p> <p>\u201cHe tried to switch from looks to stamina but this is a man who has called women pigs, slobs and dogs, and someone who has said pregnancy is an inconvenience to employers,\u201d she said. Clinton also reminded the audience that Trump had impugned the legitimacy of the fight for equal pay \u2013 and even called upon the experiences of a specific woman, former Miss Universe Alicia Machado, whom Trump body shamed when she gained weight after winning the crown, to illustrate how he\u2019d insulted both women and the Latino community.</p> <p>Clinton had successfully weaponized Trump\u2019s words against him; she knew them all by heart, and no amount of changing the subject could get him out of it. As she herself quipped earlier, that she\u2019d prepared for the debate was obvious, and it wasn\u2019t anything to be ashamed of \u2013 rather, it was a sign she\u2019s prepared to be president.

Joanne McFadden knew the names and ages of the family she was helping to sponsor, but apart from that she too didn\u2019t know what to expect.</p> <p>She certainly wasn\u2019t prepared for the phone call that came three days after Saed (18), Mohamad (16) and Ahmed (15) started attending Shelburne Regional High School.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I get a phone call from the principal. \u2018Uhhh, Joanne, we have a problem.\u2019 \u2018What\u2019s the problem, Mary?\u2019 \u2018Well, all the girls in the school are chasing the boys.\u2019 This hadn\u2019t even crossed our mind, right, that this was even a possibility. It was like, pardon me, we\u2019ve got some things to figure out.</p> </blockquote> <p>As Joanne\u2019s telling me this story six months later, over a dinner the Hendawis are hosting for their sponsors, Mohamad helpfully flexes his muscles, as if to explain his magnetic appeal to the local girls. It\u2019s true, all three boys are ridiculously good-looking, and Mohamad in particular knows it \u2013 but his brazen preening is an act put on for your amusement, and you can\u2019t help being charmed by him.</p> <p>With the Hendawi boys\u2019 charm making waves at school, McFadden enlisted the help of a volunteer interpreter (a Lebanese man who owns the local pizzeria) and sat down with Wadah and Raghdaa.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Her face was just ashen while I\u2019m saying, \u2018We have a little concern about the boys\u2019 situation at the school. Your sons are being pursued by all of the girls in the school who sort of want a conquest.\u2019</p> </blockquote> <p>Fears about young Arab men are not uncommon in Europe, where the refugee crisis and rightwing rhetoric have fuelled cultural tensions. But as I discovered in Nova Scotia, Canadians don\u2019t always follow the standard script.</p> <p>Canada has so much in common with Australia, and yet spending time there with Syrian families and their sponsors felt like stepping through a looking glass.</p> <p>This is a country where politicians tried to outbid one another during the last federal election with pledges to resettle Syrian refugees.</p> <p>It\u2019s a country in which no political party has an anti-immigration platform.</p> <p>And it\u2019s a country where the government, after fulfilling its promise to welcome 25,000 Syrians, was forced to extend the program after protests from would-be sponsors who\u2019d already raised hundreds of thousands of dollars and signed leases for homes.</p> <p>More than 30,000 Syrians have arrived since November (excluding Quebec, which has its own settlement program), and almost half of those are being privately sponsored to some extent.</p> <p>While government-assisted refugees are usually settled in cities and large towns, families who are privately sponsored can end up anywhere. In more than 300 communities across the country, locals have banded together to provide housing, English classes, driving lessons, a crash course in Canadian customs (pot luck dinners, poutine) and, most important of all, friendship.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"107da95f9ccd86338a20ded50b1b2bd60a643ce0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/107da95f9ccd86338a20ded50b1b2bd60a643ce0/0_0_3840_2560/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Shelburne local Bill Murphy took Wadah Hendawi to meet local fishermen \u2013 making contacts like this in the community may lead to job opportunities.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Shelburne local Bill Murphy took Wadah Hendawi to meet local fishermen \u2013 making contacts like this in the community may lead to job opportunities.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Amos Roberts/SBS Dateline</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The trigger for this outpouring of compassion was a tragedy that touched people around the world last September \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/31/alan-kurdi-death-canada-refugee-policy-syria-boy-beach-turkey-photo\">the drowning of three year-old Alan Kurdi</a>, washed up on a Turkish beach.</p> <p>But unlike Australians, Canadians who were moved to do something actually could.</p> <p><em>\u201c</em>When that picture became public, the phones were ringing off the hook,<em>\u201d </em>Naomi Alboim tells me. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t keep up with the phone calls and emails of people who wanted to help.\u201d</p> <p> Alboim is the co-founder of Lifeline Syria in Toronto, which recruits and trains sponsors, and she\u2019s involved in sponsoring two families herself. She was also instrumental in the first great wave of private sponsorship, which transformed Canada almost 40 years ago.</p> <p>From 1979-81 Canada resettled 60,000 refugees from Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos, and half of those were sponsored. Alboim was the civil servant responsible for the program in Ontario.</p> <p>She says that ever since, sponsorship has become part of the national DNA.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I think everybody in Canada, and I don\u2019t think this is an exaggeration, was either directly involved or knew someone who was \u2013 their neighbour, their colleague, their friend, their relative, or themselves. People saw the Vietnamese population integrated very, very well. What I find most heart-warming, is that many of the Vietnamese refugees who were privately sponsored have now come forward to privately sponsor Syrian refugees.</p> </blockquote> <p>So are Canadians immune from the sort of fears (and Islamophobia) that are so common in other countries? Not entirely. But when I asked people in Shelburne if there had been any opposition or even unease at the prospect of a Muslim family being settled in their midst, there was precious little prejudice on display.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/26/british-royals-syrian-refugees-prince-william-kate-middleton-canada\">Syrian refugees in Canada hope British royals will advocate for 'people in need'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There were a few concerns about supporting strangers while local families were struggling, and about newcomers taking jobs. And according to Bill Murphy, who\u2019s befriended Wadah Hendawi, there were some politically incorrect attempts at humour.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Some people would make a kind of wise crack comment you know, \u2018We\u2019ll just check them for vests when they come into the country\u2019. I heard that, but you never hear it now, that was all before the fact.</p> </blockquote> <p>More than six months later, there are now two Syrian families in Shelburne. Wadah surprised his sponsors by accepting a part time job bottling beer in the local craft brewery. And another refugee, Alaa Almanjar, has already opened a barbershop on the main street; as a result, one sponsor told me, \u201cWe have very, very well-groomed men for such a small town.\u201d</p> <p>And what of the Hendawi boys, who\u2019d unwittingly unleashed all those female hormones at the local high school?</p> <p>In the end, McFadden explained, the girls were told to be mindful that the boys had different cultural traditions and to slow down a bit.</p> <p>\u201cYeah, that is good for me,\u201d Mohamad pipes up, \u201cbecause I am tired every time.\u201d</p> <p><em>See more of Amos Robert\u2019s story Tuesday night on <a href=\"http://www.sbs.com.au/news/dateline/story/canadas-open-house\">Dateline</a>, 9.30pm on SBS.</em><br></p>",
