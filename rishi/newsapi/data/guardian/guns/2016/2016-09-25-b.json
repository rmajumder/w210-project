  "<p>An unlikely alliance of the Queen, Prince William, the Labour MP Frank Field, Commonwealth countries and Canadian ecologists join forces today to protect one of the largest coastal temperate rainforests in the world: the <a href=\"http://www.hellobc.com/great-bear-rainforest.aspx\">Great Bear rainforest</a> along the central and west coast of British Columbia.</p> <p>Prince William is in the Canadian province for a weeklong visit and will announce on Monday that the forest will join an international network of forests designed to involve all 53 countries in the Commonwealth.</p> <p>The network of forests is part of the <a href=\"http://queenscommonwealthcanopy.org/\">Queen\u2019s Commonwealth Canopy</a> (QCC), a forest conservation initiative launched in the monarch\u2019s name at the Malta Commonwealth summit last year. </p> <p>Field said: \u201cThe aim is to form a network and collective voice that rivals the Amazonian rainforest in size, and makes a permanent contribution to fight against climate change. The existence of many Commonwealth nations is directly imperilled by climate change, and this is now a subject that is at the heart of the Commonwealth\u2019s purpose.\u201d </p> <p>Field, better known for his campaigning work in the field of welfare, launched the Cool Earth charity in 2007 with the businessman Johan Eliasch, with the aim of providing local people with an alternative to quick cash from loggers. </p> <p>The charity has worked with indigenous communities in Peru, Ecuador and the Democratic Republic of the Congo to put local people back in control of the forest.</p> <p>Since the Commonwealth was created in 1949, nearly half of its forest has been lost, about a quarter depleted and the remainder has been at great risk. The Commonwealth forest still represents as much as 20% of the world\u2019s total. <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"db3594db0bd08207ddf6841d2e27a133204e09df\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/db3594db0bd08207ddf6841d2e27a133204e09df/0_107_3936_2361/1000.jpg\" alt=\"British Columbia passed legislation this year to protect the Great Bear forest from industrial logging.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">British Columbia passed legislation this year to protect the Great Bear forest from industrial logging.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Julie Picardi/Barcroft Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The aim of the network, apart from accrediting sustainable forestry schemes within the Commonwealth, is to combine knowledge on how best to preserve the forests.

  "<p>Parents are being urged to boycott requests to disclose their child\u2019s nationality and country of birth over fears it could turn teachers into de facto border guards and stoke divisions in the classroom. </p> <p>Human rights groups are concerned that the data, collected for the first time this year from pupils aged two to 19 as part of the schools census, could be used against children and their families by immigration enforcement. </p> <p>The Department for Education (DfE) insists that the information will not be handed to the Home Office and that the data is being collected and input to the national pupil database (NPD) to ensure children \u201creceive the best possible education\u201d. </p> <p>However, <a href=\"https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/pupil_data_sharing_with_the_poli#incoming-846569\">disclosures under freedom of information laws</a> have shown that the Home Office has been handed NPD data on 18 occasions since 2012, while police requests for information from the dataset were granted 31 times.</p> <p>Disclosure is not compulsory, but a recent <a href=\"http://schoolsweek.co.uk/pupils-who-were-not-white-british-told-to-send-in-birthplace-data/\">investigation by the trade magazine Schools Week</a> found that schools were misinterpreting official guidance by demanding pupils\u2019 passport numbers and even specifically targeting the parents of non-white children. </p> <p>\u201cThat creates a climate where half the class is being told you\u2019ve got to bring in your passport and the other half haven\u2019t,\u201d said Gracie Mae Bradley, from Against Borders for Children. \u201cIn a post-Brexit environment, kids are already precarious; they are already feeling like it\u2019s not a good thing to be a migrant child and this further divides them.\u201d </p> <p>She called on parents to boycott the census questions. \u201cIf every parent in the country exercised that right to refuse, that would protect all undocumented children from any potential enforcement action and it also sends a very strong signal about the kind of society that we want to live in.\u201d</p> <p>On Monday, more than 20 groups are writing to the education secretary, Justine Greening, to ask her to reverse the requirement for schools to collect the data, warning that the plan risked violating the right to privacy of children and families.</p> <p>\u201cOur grave concern is that the new data will be shared with the Home Office and therefore used for immigration enforcement purposes,\u201d says the letter, whose signatories include Liberty, the Migrants\u2019 Rights Network and Privacy International. </p> <p>\u201cWe have already seen data-sharing between the Home Office and other departments increase since the government announced its commitment to creating a \u2018hostile environment\u2019 for undocumented migrants. Such measures deter vulnerable children and families from accessing essential services, exercising their human rights and participating on an equal basis in our communities.\u201d</p> <p>Campaigners see the new census requirement as the latest step in a crackdown on what the government has dubbed \u201ceducation tourism\u201d. In 2013, ministers were forced to abandon <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/mar/27/ministers-immigration-crackdown-education-tourists\">proposals to exclude the children of undocumented migrants</a> from school, amid fears it would breach <a href=\"http://www.ohchr.org/en/professionalinterest/pages/crc.aspx\">international human rights law</a>.</p> <p>But two years later, Nicky Morgan, then education secretary, ordered officials to <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/immigration/11805477/Nicky-Morgan-orders-immigration-review-to-examine-education-tourism.html\">investigate how much of a \u201cpull factor\u201d state schools were for immigrants</a>, as part of measures to slash net migration. \u201cAnd then, in 2016, you get this announcement about monitoring the scale and impact of pupil migration on the education sector,\u201d Bradley said.</p> <p>Bella Sankey, policy director of Liberty, the human rights group, said the latest plan risked creating \u201ca chilling effect around school attendance\u201d. </p> <p>\u201cHostile-environment policies are deeply problematic,\u201d she said. \u201cThey outsource immigration enforcement to private citizens and public sector workers whose roles have nothing to do with border control. This latest wave of reforms targets sensitive public services like healthcare and education. It is insidious to be targeting the kids and risks making them additionally vulnerable if they are then kept away from school.\u201d</p> <p>Don Flynn, director of the Migrants\u2019 Rights Network, said the proposal jeopardised \u201ca decade of real advance\u201d in the relationships between schools and migrant communities. He said: \u201cPeople in migrant communities across the UK have been thrown into great uncertainty about their future as a result of the Brexit vote and the harsher tone of the public debate. </p> <p>\u201cThe DfE should not be adding to this anxiety by introducing a measure which will inevitably increase the sense of being watched and scrutinised by state agencies with a view to future deportations.\u201d</p> <p>The DfE insisted it took the privacy of children seriously and that the data would be used for research purposes and not be routinely published. A spokesperson said: \u201cThese data items will not be passed to the Home Office. They are solely for internal Department for Education use for analysis, statistics and research.</p> <p>\u201cThis information will be used to help us better understand how children with, for example, English as an additional language, perform in terms of their broader education and to assess and monitor the scale and impact immigration may be having on the schools sector.\u201d</p>",

Despite this overall success, Michael Harding, a food hygiene rating scheme support officer at the FSA, said any instance of a care organisation receiving a low score was \u201ca cause for concern\u201d, due to the fact that vulnerable people, including children, older people and people who are ill, were more likely to use their services.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/25/day-in-life-food-safety-inspector-newham-east-london-hygiene\">\u2018Mouse droppings were everywhere\u2019: a day in the life of a food inspector</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThe food safety officer will be taking the necessary action to ensure that the issues identified at caring premises with a lower rating are addressed and that vulnerable people are not put at risk,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Eight care providers still in operation scored zero, including six residential care homes, one nursery and one after-school care facility, which has since stopped preparing food for children.</p> <p>A ninth, Fairy Tales day nursery in Glen Parva, Leicestershire, received a score of zero in May after inspectors found a mouse infestation.

The NT\u2019s population is about 244,000.</p> <p>\u201cOne child every day in the Territory is subject to domestic violence, and three children per day witness domestic violence in the home or on land,\u201d Kershaw told ABC radio.</p> <p>Cavanagh noted there had been 17 deaths related to domestic violence in the NT in the past four years, seven in Alice Springs.</p> <p>Murphy was killed on 19 December 2014 in Alice Springs\u2019 Hoppy\u2019s town camp. McCormack died on 29 March 2015, also in Alice Springs. The causes of death were blunt head and chest trauma to Murphy, and a stab wound to McCormack\u2019s thigh.</p> <p>Police were aware of 45 clashes between Murphy and her then partner, Stanley Scrutton, between 2003 and 2014, and Cavanagh described at least 33 of them being cases of extreme violence by Scrutton against Murphy.</p> <p>\u201cIt is a terrible truth that there were so many recorded assaults on Kwementyaye that it is not necessary to detail all of them to make clear the horrendous nature of the violence she experienced,\u201d wrote Cavanagh.</p> <p>After the first of more than 30 police callouts to youth carer McCormack and her partner Nathan Swan, police records noted a history of domestic violence for both individuals, but not with each other.

It also noted a victim may face threats of her children being taken off her by family members, such as her mother-in-law.<br></p> <p>\u201cThe family ties of the communities make it more likely that perpetrators would feel the effect of personal and community disapproval,\u201d said Cavanagh. \u201cThat is something they currently do not feel.\u201d</p> <p>Jacinta Price, Alice Springs councillor and daughter of former NT minister Bess Price, told Guardian Australia: \u201cWithin families we protect perpetrators, and female victims can suffer repercussions from family members of the perpetrators. </p> <p>\u201cYou have an obligation to your kin to the point where you protect perpetrators, and I don\u2019t think enough of that is recognised.\u201d</p> <p>On Thursday Price told the ABC violence in Aboriginal communities was accepted as the norm. \u201cUntil our broader community can understand this and until our mob can say yes this is a deep-seated issue, this is something we do accept, we need to change this way of thinking,\u201d Price said.</p> <p>She told Guardian Australia the coroner\u2019s findings were not surprising to her or many others, and she felt Cavanagh\u2019s claim that violence was \u201cout of control\u201d was an understatement.</p> <p>\u201cIt has been like it for some time and there doesn\u2019t appear to be any improvement, and I\u2019m upset about the lack of the issue being taken seriously by our leaders in Canberra, particularly those representing Indigenous people themselves.</p> <p>\u201cThe issue of women dying at such an alarming late and the fact that our children are experiencing the high levels of violence should be at the forefront of all debate and the issue should be on everybody\u2019s minds.\u201d</p> <p>The primary concern, she said, was for an \u201copen dialogue\u201d about cultural and practical hurdles and forms of oppression in Indigenous communities for women facing violence.</p> <p>\u201cI know for a fact the way Aboriginal men have controlled remote communities \u2013 culturally, secrecy is used a means of control, controlling women and controlling economies, and it has gone on far too long,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cNow it is time to be far more open and discuss these issues openly, but this is going to take cultural change to happen, and all cultural change, whether it is light change or positive change, to begin with it\u2019s painful.\u201d</p> <p>Price said \u201cguilt politics\u201d had encouraged the blaming of others over taking responsibility for problems, and seen non-Indigenous people who voice concerns \u201ctoo easily shot down\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThese are Australian women who are dying and Australian children who are suffering the consequences.

But there is also evidence some are bearing the brunt of the downsides to the UK\u2019s expanding low-pay economy.</p> <p>Nine out of 10 newly created jobs in the three months to the end of May were self-employed, according to official figures. There are now 4.76 million self-employed workers, but almost half are low paid, according to the Social Market Foundation thinktank.

He suffers from diabetes, which has caused his lower leg to inflame, and he walks with a stick. He doesn\u2019t claim benefits and relied for living expenses on the \u00a380 to \u00a390 a week he was earning for delivering daily and Sunday papers on a 21-mile round for Midcounties Co-op. Each round would take him about four-and-a-half hours yet his payslips, seen by the Guardian, showed he was only taking home about \u00a385 a week \u2013 well below the minimum wage. This was despite him being something of a star worker. When he completed 20 years on the round in 2014, the Midcounties Co-op chief executive, Ben Reid, congratulated him in person in the store.</p> <p>But some of his customers worried about him when they saw him struggling up their lanes and through bad weather to bring them their daily papers.</p> <p> \u201cI suspected for a while he was being exploited in some way,\u201d said Colin Robertson, 91, a retired electrical engineer. \u201cIt is very unfortunate that a body like the Co-op, which purports to be a wholly ethical organisation, should be at the bottom of something like this. Rodney always did his utmost and was always absolutely determined to make the delivery.\u201d </p> <p>Lilley, on the other hand, came to the job after a career as an executive search consultant and then running his own businesses. He had put work on hold to look after his mother-in-law, who was suffering from dementia.</p> <p>\u201cShe needed 24-hour care but between 5am and 8am she was fast asleep so I could nip out and do the work and it did me the world of good,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is so isolating caring for somebody. It was meeting people, getting out, but above everything else putting some money on the table.\u201d</p> <p>He quickly realised that the terms on which he was working meant he was taking home just a couple of pounds a day after he paid his car expenses. So he challenged Midcounties Co-op in 2014 and then, when it rejected his claim that he was earning less than the national minimum wage, he complained to HM Revenue and Customs in 2015. Midcounties Co-op finalised its payouts to him last month.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t have a problem with them cocking up, but the tooth and claw way they resisted this is just indefensible,\u201d he said. \u201cSince I raised this with the shop it has been three-and-a-half years and mountains of paperwork.\u201d</p> <p>Midcounties Co-op has apologised to both men and said it has rectified the problems.</p> <p>\u201cHMRC has agreed a new methodology for calculating the time involved in completing delivery rounds and this now forms the basis of the hourly payment received by our colleagues,\u201d said Reid. \u201cOur colleagues are also asked to confirm if they have any health issues that we may need to take into account to enable us to make reasonable adjustments to their rounds and the times involved.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>For a political party opposition is a difficult, exhausting and an unattractive business. If the purpose of a party is to bring about change in society and shape it to reflect the values of its own ideology, then parliamentary opposition seems the wrong place to be. Opposition is the antithesis of what parties are for. Or so it seemed. Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s refreshed mandate as leader of the opposition has been cast as a triumph of party members over the party\u2019s members of parliament.</p> <p>The Labour leader\u2019s supporters say their \u201cmovement\u201d should be seen as part of a global trend comparable to the <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/04/bernie-sanders-supporters/478005/\" title=\"\">grassroots success</a> of US senator Bernie Sanders or the advances of Podemos\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.opendemocracy.net/can-europe-make-it/mike-pope/rise-of-podemos-and-its-people's-assembly\" title=\"\">people\u2019s assemblies in Spain</a>. While social movements have a dynamism missing from slow-moving parliamentary processes, it is a mistake to think representative democracy is redundant in an age of networked politics.</p> <p>The British parliament is the cockpit of the nation\u2019s history. A functioning opposition is not merely sufficient, it is necessary to provide serious scrutiny of government legislation, especially when such a prospectus is unapproved by the electorate. As the sage of parliament <a href=\"https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=HOyzjmbSEIoC&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;redir_esc=y\" title=\"\">Walter Bagehot noted</a>, this country was the first that \u201cmade a criticism of the administration as much a part of the polity as administration itself\u201d.</p> <p>However integral the role is, parties do not seek opposition. They have it thrust upon them. Of course, losing an election might mean a party has time to reflect, renew and reinvigorate itself. MPs in opposition have to show that the policies and positions of the victorious party are damaging and wrong. Close, patient arguments can secure concessions from ministers that lead to real change in policy.</p> <p>That is why the relationship between Mr Corbyn and the party he leads is so important. Labour needs to come together, not come apart. Some of Mr Corbyn\u2019s more hardline supporters see the scale of his victory as a licence to expunge internal dissent. In this view, the renewed mandate from members must be deployed with force to refashion the party machine and its parliamentary representation to better reflect the leader\u2019s agenda. There will be pressure on nay-sayers to change their tune or quit.</p> <p>But the rebels are already chastened. Owen Smith\u2019s challenge failed. Those Labour MPs who expressed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/26/momentum-jeremy-corbyn-loyalists--confront-rebel-labour-mps\" title=\"\">no confidence in their leader</a> have no choice but to accept that their judgment has been overruled. They might not be able to change their opinion but they should be constructive and discreet with criticism. The running commentary on Mr Corbyn\u2019s performance from his own benches must stop. Likewise, the talk of punitive deselection for non-compliant MPs should be dropped. Labour has wasted the summer arguing with itself. That is not Mr Corbyn\u2019s fault \u2013 he was responding to an internal challenge. But it has, perversely, suited him.

Mr Corbyn has won. Twice. Labour\u2019s platform will necessarily become more Corbynite. But what exactly does that mean? His supporters believe he embodies a set of values that they want the party to represent. That is a mostly abstract proposition, made concrete in a handful of emblematic policies \u2013 nationalising the railways; <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/sep/11/jeremy-corbyn-vows-to-scrap-mays-grammar-schools-plan\" title=\"\">opposing grammar schools</a>.

That vagueness is a luxury he can no longer afford. After the railways, what else might Labour bring into public ownership? If Labour opposes grammar schools and mistrusts academies, would Mr Corbyn shut down the ones that exist already? With what would he replace them? Every assertion of principle begets multiple questions of practice.</p> <p>Unsupportive Labour MPs never stopped Mr Corbyn from giving answers before and are not stopping him now. The party is his to lead. The parliamentary rebels must let him lead it.

  "<p>The illegal trade in endangered fauna and flora is the world\u2019s fourth biggest, after the trades in drugs, counterfeit goods and people. The difference is that there is no shortage of the other three. Every 15 minutes, an elephant is killed by poachers. A third of Africa\u2019s savannah elephants were slaughtered between 2007 and 2014. On current trends, by the time that today\u2019s children reach adulthood, the African elephant will be extinct in the wild.</p> <p>This is not inevitable. Governments are about to embark on a three-yearly meeting to discuss the future of international wildlife protection. Cites, the convention on international trade in endangered species of wild flora and fauna, brings together nearly every country on Earth in pledges to protect threatened nature.</p> <p>On Monday, the plight of elephants will take centre stage at the Johannesburg meeting and the results will affect all endangered animals. On the table is a proposal to allow a limited international market in ivory that proponents say will benefit conservation, by allowing countries with stockpiles of tusks \u2013 some historic, some confiscated from poachers, some from elephants that died naturally \u2013 to raise money that can be ploughed back into poaching prevention. It is a seductive argument. Unfortunately, in the case of endangered species, this does not work. The evidence from past tusk sales is clear: legalised markets in elephant ivory sustain demand and provide a cover for illegal trading and poaching.</p> <p>Encouragingly, the UK is set to take a stand and has moved ahead of Europe in tightening its own rules on the trade in tusks. British officials will not only oppose new legalised ivory sales but push our own domestic rules even further.</p> <p>At present, ivory produced before 1947 can legally be bought in the UK, but sellers can circumvent the law by claiming lack of knowledge of the provenance. Under tightened rules, they will have to produce evidence of the pre-1947 origin. This is a good and important step, and will help prevent the UK being a clearing house for poached tusks. Brexiters might relish the chance to thumb their nose at the European Union by advocating a total international ban on ivory sales, but Britain should not go too far. To forbid any kind of ivory to be sold anywhere would include everything from jumble sale ornaments to Steinway grand pianos. The evidence is that most illegal poaching takes place in countries where there is no possibility of future ivory sales.</p> <p>In this global arena, the real players are China and the United States. As long as there are buyers for ivory, elephants will be slaughtered. We must address the uncomfortable question of why some continue to prize the remains of dead, rare, beautiful creatures above their living nature, and how we can educate people to change this. China and the US have the opportunity in the Cites meeting to build on their newfound shared stance on the environment by extending protections to other globally endangered wildlife.</p> <p>In 1990 Cites banned the ivory trade to stem poaching, but the slaughter continues. The convention will fail in its aims to save disappearing species without government commitments to reduce demand and to increase funding for conservation. Cites can do without the tusks. It needs teeth.</p>",
  "<p>Allies of Theresa May have rejected claims that she failed to pull her weight in the campaign to stay in the EU, after David Cameron\u2019s former media chief said she declined to help on 13 occasions.</p> <p>Sir Craig Oliver, who was No 10 communications director until July, writes in his book that May frustrated the remain campaign by pursuing a \u201csubmarine strategy\u201d of disappearing from view.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/25/that-didnt-go-to-plan-cameron-spin-doctor-brexit-vote-craig-oliver\">\u2018Well, that didn't go to plan\u2019: Cameron\u2019s spin doctor on the Brexit vote</a> </p> </aside>  <p>He said Will Straw, the director of the remain campaign, had been so uncertain where her true loyalties lay, he sent a text asking: \u201cAre we sure May\u2019s not an agent for the other side!?\u201d</p> <p>May, who was then home secretary, came out for remaining in the EU early on but kept a low profile in the referendum and made only one public intervention in favour of the in campaign.

Downing Street had no response to Oliver\u2019s book but sources said it had not elicited much of a reaction in No 10, as it was going over history rather than current events.</p> <p>Duncan Smith said: \u201cIn the past, a knight of the realm who had failed in battle and lost would have quit the field and retired in humility to better understand their own failings. How surprising then to find that far from that, Sir Craig Oliver, one of the leading lights of remain, has decided to instead try to pin the blame for his failure on others, particularly the new prime minister.\u201d</p> <p>Patrick McLouglin, the Conservative chairman appointed by May, also rejected the idea that she had let Cameron down during the campaign. \u201cI don\u2019t think that is true at all. Theresa May during the referendum campaign made her position very clear,\u201d he said on Sky News\u2019s Murnaghan programme.</p> <p>\u201cThis is a book that has been written after the event. You have got to have certain spicy things in a book to sell it. I don\u2019t blame Craig for doing that. At the time, Theresa was very much part of the remain campaign.\u201d</p> <p>However, Theresa Villiers, the former Northern Ireland secretary, who campaigned for leave, said she believed May might have had a foot in both camps. \u201cThere were times that I did wonder,\u201d she told BBC One\u2019s Sunday Politics programme. \u201cHer major speech of the referendum campaign expressed real concerns about the possibility of Turkey joining the EU. It also said that the sky is not going to fall in if we leave. I think she was genuinely listening to both sides.\u201d</p> <p>Oliver writes: \u201cAmid the murder and betrayal of the campaign, one figure stayed very still at the centre of it all \u2013 Theresa May. Now she is the last one standing.\u201d </p> <p>He describes one conversation after Cameron had sounded out May about her views on the EU. \u201cIt sounds like she refused to come off the fence. From her point of view it\u2019s a smart strategy, trying to demonstrate she is her own person, allowing her to have her cake and eat it, but it doesn\u2019t seem fair on DC, who has treated her well,\u201d he wrote.<br></p> <p>There was further concern within No 10 when May was \u201cplaying her cards close to her chest\u201d during a conversation about the EU in cabinet. \u201cHer sphinx-like approach is becoming difficult, with the press questioning which way she will jump. The conversation turns around this being the biggest thing the PM has faced and him not even knowing if the home secretary is backing him,\u201d he wrote.</p> <p>Cameron ended up telephoning May during a train journey to Chippenham for a speech and demanded she make her position clear. \u201cWhen he hangs up he seems to think he\u2019s made an impact,\u201d Oliver wrote. \u201cLater, the home secretary issues a statement saying she believes there\u2019s \u2018the basis for a deal here\u2019.</p> <p>\u201cThis is interpreted as the moment she climbed down off the fence. After all the concern around her, it all seems to have ended not with a bang, but a whimper.\u201d</p> <p>Duncan Smith said: \u201cCraig Oliver\u2019s is one of a growing number of foolish attempts by ex-government remainers who lost to shift responsibility for their failure. The grown-up thing for them to do, instead of carping, is to show some humility and get behind Theresa May as she seeks to get back control of migration with the EU as we leave.\u201d</p> <p>Recriminations over the referendum continued in another book, All Out War, by Sunday Times political editor Tim Shipman. It claimed Cameron described May as \u201clily-livered\u201d for advising him not to demand an emergency brake on migration because it would be blocked by other European leaders. This was disputed by allies of May, who insisted she had supported Cameron\u2019s aims for an emergency brake.<br></p> <p>No 10 was so irritated by the allegation that May had shunned an emergency brake on EU migration that two letters were released to back up claims she had endorsed the measure.</p>",

They are the only figures with executive roles that put them in charge of multi-billion pound budgets. </p> <p>In his speech to the conference Jones spoke in detail about what Labour is doing in Wales, but he also used his speech to make a wider point. Here are the key points.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Jones stressed the importance of Labour winning power.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Conference we need to constantly remind ourselves what Labour being in Government actually means. That is our historic mission - that is the journey that Hardie started and every Labour leader since must try and advance.</p> <p> How was it that Bevan finished his great quote \u201cthe Language of priorities is the religion of socialism\u201d? It was with these words: \u201conly by the possession of power can you get the priorities correct\u201d ...</p> <p>This country needs the Labour party, but we don\u2019t have a God-given right to exist. It is time for us to focus on the things that really matter, and as Bevan said, only the successful pursuit of power can truly give you that focus. </p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He said the Labour government in Wales would be bringing forward plans to prevent the use of agency workers to undermine strike action in the public sector. </strong></li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>He said the the Labour government in Wales was both pro-business and pro-union.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Conference, when we launched our programme for government, both the CBI and TUC could see how we had reflected their priorities. </p> <p>We are not playing a zero sum game in Wales between capital and communities. Massive infrastructure investment will get Wales moving, it will boost our economy and it will bring better jobs closer to home for Welsh communities. </p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He said the Welsh government would soon investigate the changing nature of work.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We don\u2019t just want jobs, we want better jobs. And as Yvette Cooper has written about so passionately and persuasively, it is down to Labour to recognize the changing patterns of work, the challenges and opportunities of new technologies, and the insecurity that stalks too many working lives. </p> <p>These are lessons not lost on us in Wales, and the Welsh government will shortly begin a deep and thorough investigation into the changing nature of work to make sure we keep pace with the new challenges.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He said the Welsh government would tomorrow launch \u201ca new universal child health programme to ensure every child gets excellent, consistent health services across Wales\u201d.</strong></li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>He said Labour members had to treat each other with more respect.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>And a starting point for us must be to regain our dignity in the way we speak to one another and the way we speak to the world. </p> <p>It wasn\u2019t that long ago that the Party\u2019s priority was anti-poverty policies, but now we\u2019re commissioning reports on anti-Semitism in our own Party. How has that happened? </p> <p>We have no hope of creating an open, tolerant country if we cannot first do the same for our own Party.

She might be able to tell them what courage, principles and backbone is all about.</p> </blockquote> <p>McCluskey said Corbyn had \u201creconnected with people\u201d, but had prompted too much suspicion from many Labour MPs and others about the mass of new members.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Are they not pleased of that, proud of that? Do they have to moan and groan about handfuls of so-called Trots who have infiltrated?</p> </blockquote> <p>While predicting that \u201cthe vast majority\u201d of shadow cabinet members who chose to quite would now return, McCluskey claimed it was their revolt which caused Labour\u2019s such poor current polling.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The truth of the matter is, until there was this mass hysteria and a rush by PLP members to abandon their roles and their jobs, the opinion polls were showing that we were level. In fact a few of them were showing that we were ahead.</p> </blockquote> <p>The event was co-sponsored by the Daily Mirror, and McCluskey was no less diplomatic with them, saying: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It would be hypocritical of me if I didn\u2019t register my disappointment with the manner in which the Mirror has conducted itself during the leadership campaign. It was heartbreaking for me to see the Mirror fall into the group-think of the Westminster bubble, sniping against Jeremy Corbyn.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57e7d9cde4b0f55a9f403167\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/jessica-elgot\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-25T14:09:13.229Z\">3.09pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Jeremy Corbyn</strong> has made an impromptu appearance at the Momentum festival, The World Transformed, which packed out last night until 2am to celebrate the Labour leader\u2019s victory. </p> <p>Sessions on fracking, academisation of schools and workshops on becoming a local councillor were running this morning when Corbyn turned up in the main hall to speak to a delighted crowd. He told them:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This event here might be described by many as some kind of fringe, extreme or whatever event. I see the kind of discussions that are happening here in this programme as absolutely central and mainstream to how people think and what we are trying to do.

The general secretary is essentially a functionary - the party\u2019s most senior administrator/bureaucrat - and generally the speech is very dull.</p> <p>But this year\u2019s - for anyone interested in Labour party Kremlinology - was fascinating. The general secretary is <strong>Iain McNicol</strong> and he has an awkward relationship with Jeremy Corbyn. He was appointed before Corbyn was elected, he is not loyal to Corbyn, he used to work for the GMB, which backed Owen Smith, not Corbyn, and that Corbynites suspect that fixed the leadership contest rules as far as possible to maximise Smith\u2019s chances. It has also been reported that Corbyn would like to get rid of him, and replace him with an acolyte, although at the moment Corbyn does not have the votes on the national executive committee to make that happen.</p> <p>To a casual listener McNicol\u2019s speech may have sounded routine. But in fact it was full of coded support for Corbyn\u2019s opponents.</p> <ul> <li><strong>McNicol explicitly backed \u201cclause one socialism\u201d - the philosophy championed by Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s critics that stresses the importance of Labour being an effective force in parliament. </strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Labour was created for a very specific purpose, explicit from the very start.</p> <p>And that purpose is stated in black and white in our constitution.</p> <p>\u2018To organise and maintain in Parliament and in the country a political Labour Party and \u2018The Party shall bring together members and supporters who share its values.\u2019</p> <p>That\u2019s our Labour party.</p> <p>A party founded to win elections and form governments.</p> <p>To make our values real through practical change.</p> <p>It\u2019s a powerful idea and I\u2019ve not heard a better one.</p> </blockquote> <p>This might sound like a statement of the obvious, and of course Corbyn would say that he wants Labour to be an effective force in parliament. But the leadership contest became a battle between those who said the wishes of Labour members should take priority (Corbyn) and those who argued a leader had to retain the confidence of MPs (Smith), and McNicol is explicitly siding with the latter. The quote about Labour being set up to \u201corganise and maintain in parliament ... a political Labour party\u201d is from clause one of Labour\u2019s constitution and Smith supporters quoted it during the leadership contest as a reason as a reason why Corbyn could not lead the party. And Progress, the Blairite pressure group which is loathed by some Corbynites, recently published <a href=\"http://www.progressonline.org.uk/2016/09/22/clause-one-socialists-will-win-the-day/\">an editorial explicitly urging \u201cclause one socialists\u201d to stay in the party and fight for their cause.</a></p> <ul> <li><strong>McNicol said criticised people who wrote off the achievements of the last Labour government. </strong>He said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There will always be those Tories who want to write off the Labour years, and pretend no good came from them.</p> <p>Let\u2019s make sure none of us ever falls into that Tory trap.</p> </blockquote> <p>This seemed clearly aimed at the Corbynites, some of whom seem to find it much easier to condemn the record of the Blair/Brown governments than to praise them.</p> <ul> <li><strong>He praised party staff and said that he would always defend them \u201cwhenever they come under attack\u201d.</strong> There have been reports <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/staggers/2016/08/how-jeremy-corbyn-will-reshape-labour-s-backrooms-after-victory\">(like this one, for example, by the New Statesman\u2019s Stephen Bush) </a>suggesting that the Corbynites want to get rid of not just McNicol, but other staff at Labour HQ deemed insufficiently loyal. McNicol signalled that he would oppose this strongly. When he talked about staff coming \u201cunder attack\u201d, he did not mean from the Tories. He said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I want to say something about the people who work for the Labour party.</p> <p>We expect a huge amount from them.</p> <p>They work weekends and evenings. They drop everything to fight by-elections or local elections. They put this Party conference together year after year. They are some of the brightest and the best our movement has.</p> <p>I value them, I respect them, and I stand in solidarity with them whenever they come under attack.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He explicitly praised the parliamentary Labour party (PLP), most of whom opposed Corbyn\u2019s re-election.</strong> He said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Hard-working Labour champions, winning seats for Labour, and denying Tories, and SNP and Lib Dems an extra seat in Parliament.</p> <p>That\u2019s the PLP - Labour through and through, and deserving our whole-hearted gratitude and support.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5ca9c11883261d0817beb4f9be3788ea0f9582bc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5ca9c11883261d0817beb4f9be3788ea0f9582bc/0_19_3205_1923/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Iain McNicol speaking at the conference.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Iain McNicol speaking at the conference.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jon Super/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-09-25T13:21:45.682Z\">at 2.21pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57e7b70ae4b0f55a9f4030d4\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-25T11:39:26.486Z\">12.39pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Heidi Alexander,</strong> who resigned as shadow health secretary, was on the Sunday Politics earlier.

But he insisted that he wants most MPs to stay. Asked if he wanted MPs to be reinstated, or if he wanted the process to result in a new breed of MPs being chosen, he replied:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I wish them [existing MPs] well. The relationship between an MP and their constituency is a complex one. It is not necessarily all the policy, tick-boxing exercise. It is also the relationship with the community, the effectiveness of representation and all those issues. Let\u2019s have a democratic discussion. I think the vast majority of MPs will have no problems whatsoever.</p> </blockquote> <p>Corbyn was making the point that, if local parties want to get rid of MPs, it might not necessarily be because of their political views. But the phrase \u201cthe vast majority\u201d suggests that Corbyn expects at least a few MPs to be replaced before the next election.</p> <ul> <li><strong>He said that he was opposed to a so-called \u201chard\u201d Brexit (Brexit involving giving up access to the single market). </strong></li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>He strongly rejected Parry Mitchell\u2019s claim that it is difficult for Jews to remain in the Labour party.</strong> (See<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/sep/25/labour-conference-jeremy-corbyn-liverpool-formally-opens-after-jeremy-corbyn-re-elected-leader?page=with:block-57e783a8e4b0831a514021c8#block-57e783a8e4b0831a514021c8\"> 9.05am.)</a> Commenting on what Mitchell, a peer, said about why is is leaving the party, Corbyn replied:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It\u2019s unfortunate he would say that, because it\u2019s not a fair comment and I would hope that he would reflect on that because clearly there are diverse views within the party on issues in the Middle East, but there is absolute unity in the party of opposing any form of anti-Semitism, any form of racism in the party. That is very clear.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>Corbyn said he wanted party members, and the party conference, to have more say in Labour policy making.</strong></li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>He said that the investigations into alleged abuses by British servicemen and women in Iraq and Afghanistan should continue.</strong> Asked if he backed <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/09/24/tony-blair-end-this-army-witch-hunt-into-britains-brave-soldiers/\">Tony Blair, who this weekend said the investigations should stop</a>, Corbyn said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I have spoken to a number of soldiers that have served in Afghanistan and Iraq and I recognise the awful conditions that they were asked to serve under, and the difficulties they had with that.</p> <p>But I do think there has to be a recognition that we have signed up for international law on the behaviour of troops. America is going through the same experience, as do other European countries even though they\u2019re not signed up to the international criminal court. So I think there has to be investigations. Saying never to prosecute I think would be a step too far.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He suggested the more of the defence budget should be spent on emergency relief. </strong>Asked if defence spending should be higher or lower, he said it should not be any higher. He went on:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I think it should be efficiently used, but I also think the defence budget should also be used where necessary so that Britain is very good at actually giving aid and comfort during emergencies.

Given the choice, I would choose to stand in safe standing areas (I used to swap a grandstand ticket for a terrace ticket at away games in the 80s) but I won\u2019t stand in seated areas, because I won\u2019t align myself with men (always men in my experience) who bully women, children and those less able to be on their feet for 90 minutes.</p> <p>Of course, it only takes a few at the front to stand and then we all have to, so the problem looks bigger than it is - but the solution is more straightforward too. Warn those standing to sit down and if they stand again, eject them from the ground. Firm stewarding, CCTV and (most of all) a will to eradicate it, has more or less banished racist chanting from football grounds - the same tactics should apply to standing in seated areas. And it will once someone is seriously injured.\u201d</p> <p>I can\u2019t agree with all of this, I\u2019m afraid. In the first instance, it\u2019s not one or the other: most standing doesn\u2019t cause too much aggravation to the others around, in my experience. And, as I child, I stood on my chair and generally considered it part of the fun. I also find women to be generally capable of standing, though of course there is a problem with those who cannot, even if we must acknowledge that they are in the minority. </p> <p>So, I absolutely disagree that people who stand in seated areas should be hoofed out, and am generally loth to endorse anything that allows clubs to continue ridding their clubs of people they\u2019ve decided they no longer need; West Ham\u2019s use of \u201ccustomers\u201d is telling. Nor do I feel comfortable treating persistent standing in the same way as we treated racism, though you are right to note that sometimes people can get too aggressive; in experience, it is as much those who want to sit as those who want to stand.</p> <p>None of which is to say that you\u2019re wrong in identifying a problem, though luckily, the answer is simple: safe standing.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-09-25T14:38:26.233Z\">at 3.38pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57e7dea2e4b0f55a9f40317b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-25T14:27:31.361Z\">3.27pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>As per the preamble:</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/henrywinter/status/780034659207909377\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Instruction to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/WHUSOU?src=hash\">#WHUSOU</a> stewards: &quot;Persistent standing will be discouraged &amp; in the 1st instance steward will ask customers to be seated&#39; 1/2</p>&mdash; Henry Winter (@henrywinter) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/henrywinter/status/780034659207909377\">September 25, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/henrywinter/status/780034898577022977\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">&quot;persistent offenders will be ejected if appropriate and the details of their seat recorded.

Diafra Sakho, Andy Carroll and Andre Ayew are all missing, Winston Reid has been absent too, and the squad no longer has a fit left-back \u2013 enough to unsettle any team.

  "<p>My friend John Lane, who has died aged 85, was a dedicated racing cyclist, a scientist with a wide knowledge of insects and, in particular, an authority on mosquitoes.</p> <p>Son of Jack, a joiner, and Alice, John was born in Jersey, and was always proud to be a Jerseyman. As a boy, he was evacuated to Lancashire during the German occupation, then returned to his native island where he found work at the States Experimental Farm. He also began his cycling life with a previously banned local club. Cycling, with its emphasis on freedom and camaraderie, was a growing sport and pastime in the Channel Islands. John cycled every day until the age of 82.</p> <p>From being an \u201cagricultural technician\u201d among Jersey cattle, John then found work in a lab, examining smaller creatures at the East of Scotland College of Agriculture, Edinburgh. Fine native intelligence rather than higher education made him an expert in entomology, and in 1960 he was offered a position at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.</p> <p>His talents then led him to the US, primarily the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, where he worked on the classification of mosquitoes, particularly in Asia. John took with him a favourite hand-built British bike (a Maclean) and astonished both colleagues and remote farming communities as he rode hundreds of miles from one state to another, and across the border to Canada. \u201cGuard dogs in Alberta could be a problem,\u201d he recalled.</p> <p>In 1972 he was asked to return to the LSHTM, where he expanded its library and insect collection, and taught practical entomology to postgraduate students. One rare mosquito, first identified by John at the LSHTM, is named after him (he was glad that it is relatively benign) and he co-authored a valuable book, Mosquitoes and Their Control (2003).</p> <p>John was loved by many, but lived alone after his retirement in 1995. He decided against a return to Jersey and made his home in Halesworth, Suffolk, where he explored the roads of eastern England with fellow cyclists and extended his wonderful knowledge of birds. His eyesight was his main pleasure, he said, so why would he have a television in his house? What about the hours of darkness? I asked. \u201cI can do 20 crosswords a night, listening to music, then wake at dawn.\u201d</p> <p>He is survived by his sisters, Margaret and Betty, and eight nieces and nephews.</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.fifa.com/\">Football\u2019s international governing body, Fifa</a>, is facing pressure to rule next month that six Israeli football clubs based in illegal settlements in the occupied Palestinian territories should either relocate to Israel or be banned from Fifa-recognised competitions.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2016/09/25/israel/palestine-fifa-sponsoring-games-seized-land\">A report by Human Rights Watch (HRW) \u2013 published on Monday</a> before a Fifa meeting in October \u2013 follows an online petition signed by more than 150,000 people as well as an <a href=\"http://www.timesofisrael.com/eu-parliamentarians-urge-fifa-to-ban-israeli-settlement-clubs/\">open letter from dozens of European MEPs</a> this month calling on Fifa to act on the issue.</p> <p>The clubs in question, all located in the West Bank, include Beitar Givat Ze\u2019ev, Beitar Ironi Ariel, Ironi Yehuda, Beitar Ironi Maale Adumim and Hapoel Bik\u2019at Hayarden, all of which play in the lower Israeli leagues. </p> <p>The publication of the report comes amid hints from the South African sports official Tokyo Sexwale, who heads Fifa\u2019s committee set up to consider the issue, that it will present recommendations on a number of complaints from Palestinian football concerning Israel, including the issue of settlement teams.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/12/israeli-settlements-eu-fails-to-act-on-its-diplomats-report\">Israeli settlements: EU fails to act on its diplomats' report</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The move is opposed by Israel\u2019s football association and by the clubs involved.

While the issue of the IFA\u2019s alleged breach of Fifa rules has been under the spotlight for some time, the HRW report goes further, suggesting that Fifa is in breach of its own new ethical guidelines, introduced as part of moves to clean up its image.</p> <p>\u201cBy allowing the IFA to hold matches inside settlements, Fifa is engaging in business activity that supports Israeli settlements, contrary to the human rights commitments it recently affirmed,\u201d HRW says.</p> <p>\u201cAn <a href=\"https://www.hks.harvard.edu/content/download/79736/1789834/version/1/file/Ruggie_humanrightsFIFA_reportApril2016.pdf\">April 2016 report</a>, commissioned by Fifa and written by John Ruggie, the author of the <a href=\"http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Publications/GuidingPrinciplesBusinessHR_EN.pdf\">United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights</a> (UNGP), outline the human rights responsibilities of businesses. Newly-elected Fifa president Gianni Infantino took office pledging to steer Fifa out of the <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2016/05/04/fifa-replays-its-mistakes-qatar-human-cost-2022-world-cup-climbs-higher\">human rights</a> and corruption scandals of recent years, so that fans and players can focus on the \u2018<a href=\"http://www.uefa.org/about-uefa/news/newsid=2337045.html\">beautiful game</a>\u2019 of football.

On the argument that Israeli clubs were playing outside Israeli football\u2019s territory, he said: \u201cIt is very simple. This has nothing to do with Fifa. Those areas are disputed.\u201d</p> <p>Barzel declined to comment on the Human Rights Watch report or to affirm whether he believed that the settlement clubs were based in Israel\u2019s internationally recognised borders.</p> <p>The HRW report follows a letter from 66 MEPs this month to t Infantino, which cited as a recent precedent the decision by European football\u2019s governing body Uefa <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/20/crimean-football-battle-annexation\">that </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/20/crimean-football-battle-annexation\">Crimean football clubs could not play in the Russian league</a> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/20/crimean-football-battle-annexation\">following Russia\u2019s occupation of Crimea.</a></p> <p>Additionally, football clubs in Nagorno-Karabakh, Northern Cyprus, Luhansk Republic, Transnistria, Abkhazia and South Ossetia are excluded from Fifa and its national competitions.</p> <p>That letter argued: \u201cThe international consensus is that the West Bank, including east Jerusalem, is an \u2018occupied Palestinian territory,\u2019 not a disputed territory. The EU as well as the United States routinely exclude settlements from their cooperation programmes and agreements with Israel \u2013 and Fifa should do the same.\u201d</p> <p>Sari Bashi of HRW said: \u201cWhatever political decisions may or may not be made about the settlements in the future, they represent and contribute to serious human rights violations right now. This problem has one solution: Fifa should tell the IFA clubs to practise, pass, play all you want \u2013 but only inside Israel.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>It\u2019s 6.45am at Camden ambulance station in north London, and the day shift is just beginning. Andy Donovan, who will drive the ambulance I will accompany for the next nine hours, is making me a cup of tea. His more senior paramedic partner, Dean Lowes, is running a few minutes late. When he does arrive, Lowes looks very sorry for himself: he\u2019s got an ear infection, picked up on a friend\u2019s stag weekend in Budapest. Lowes is the ambulance\u2019s first case of the day. They nip off to the nearby Royal Free hospital in Hampstead to get some ear drops. Paramedic, heal thyself.</p> <p>All this delays us for more than an hour, and we\u2019re not ready to \u201cgo green\u201d \u2013 telling the London ambulance service\u2019s call centre near Waterloo station that they are available for a job \u2013 until after 8.30am. Lowes, who along with Donovan is featured in the BBC\u2019s new three-part series on London\u2019s overstretched ambulance service, is suitably embarrassed. \u201cThis never happens to me,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m never ill.\u201d But full marks for at least getting here. Crewing an ambulance is challenging at the best of times.</p> <p>Soon after going green, our first assignment comes in, flashing up on a monitor at the front of the ambulance. It\u2019s just about as unpleasant as it could be. One word: \u201cHANGING\u201d, and the location. It is a \u201cRed One\u201d \u2013 the top-priority call sign, meaning life-threatening. Lowes and Donovan\u2019s speed of reaction is electrifying. One moment, Lowes had been playing a Kings of Leon track on his mobile and saying how much he liked the band; the next, the ambulance is tearing south towards King\u2019s Cross.</p> <p>The call comes through at 8.49, and we get to the scene five minutes later. My heart sinks when I realise it is student accommodation. Two policemen are arriving simultaneously, and we all head up two floors in the lift to a stuffy, antiseptic white corridor. I go up with the policemen, who are bemoaning the fact their car was the closest to the scene. \u201cYou had a feeling it was going to be a funny day,\u201d one says to the other. \u201cYou said you had a feeling in your bones.\u201d \u201cYeah,\u201d says the other with a grim laugh, \u201cI should shut the fuck up.\u201d In situations like this, black humour is sometimes the only way out.</p> <p>Lowes, as senior paramedic, is first into the little study-bedroom. He has to decide if the student, who appears to have hanged himself, is dead, or, in the official language they use, to declare \u201clife extinct\u201d. It takes him just moments to satisfy himself that he is. The student is pronounced dead at 8.57. I can\u2019t bring myself to look at the body \u2013 the young man is fully clothed \u2013 for too long. What strikes me most is how peaceful he looks, and how red his hands are \u2013 the blood drains down to the hands and feet, a sign he has been dead for several hours.</p> <p>Within minutes there are half a dozen police on the scene, taking a statement from the traumatised fellow student who discovered the body, talking to the staff in the hall of residence, looking through the young man\u2019s possessions to establish his identity. It has ceased to be a medical emergency and become a police inquiry \u2013 and a personal tragedy for the family who do not yet know what has happened. It appears the young man, who was 23, was anxious about a dissertation he had failed to deliver. What a terrible, pointless waste.</p> <p>This is a shocking beginning. A suicide by hanging is rare. It is the first Lowes has witnessed. \u201cHe looked like a wax dummy,\u201d he says as we wait downstairs while he does the paperwork to certify the death. \u201cIt\u2019s when you see his passport and the picture of how he looked when he was alive that it hits you. That humanises it.\u201d Having been a body, he becomes a person. \u201cI try not to look at a dead person\u2019s effects too much,\u201d says Lowes, \u201cbecause you start to build a little story about them.\u201d \u201cYou can\u2019t go into it too deeply,\u201d adds Donovan. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of stuff you lock in the box.\u201d</p> <p>A paramedic team leader turns up. He doesn\u2019t say so, but Lowes and Donovan know he is there for their welfare \u2013 to make sure that having to deal with the young man\u2019s death has not affected them too severely. \u201cIf you want to take a bit of a break, that\u2019s fine,\u201d the team leader tells them. They don\u2019t particularly, although they do have a fag standing next to their ambulance. The morning is hot, and people stroll past the student block, laughing in the late-summer sunshine, not realising that inside a promising young life has been extinguished.</p> <p>By 11am, they are ready to roll again. They go green, pressing the button that declares the ambulance available, and in a second \u2013 literally \u2013 their next assignment flashes up. It\u2019s another Red One \u2013 a cardiac arrest in West Hampstead, a couple of miles to the north. The siren screams, I lurch around in the back of the ambulance feeling sick, and Donovan swears at the vehicles that block his way, costing him vital seconds that could mean the difference between life and death.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fa5088d1e23f7f6ae33517af2778ef93098eb232\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fa5088d1e23f7f6ae33517af2778ef93098eb232/0_164_4284_2570/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Call handlers at the emergency operations centre in Waterloo.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Call handlers at the emergency operations centre in Waterloo.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Glenn Dearing/BBC/Dragonfly</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The job is undeniably exciting, or at least seems so to me. Horrible, of course \u2013 no one wants to discover dead bodies \u2013 but also fascinating because of its unpredictable nature. You have no idea where you will go next or what you will have to deal with. \u201cThat\u2019s the beauty of it,\u201d Donovan had told me earlier. \u201cYou never know what you\u2019re going to from job to job.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s like roulette, I suggest, and he tells me that is exactly what they call the last job of the day. If you go green with, say, half an hour left of your shift, the call centre will play \u201cred roulette\u201d. Instead of giving you a less urgent call (categorised from C1 to C4, depending on the degree of seriousness), they will give you something life-threatening. It seems mad, but the logic is that whatever you do is likely to take hours \u2013 every callout seems to generate a mountain of paperwork \u2013 so you may as well go to something that is worth your while. A practical, if heartless, way of looking at it. Paramedics often work 12-hour shifts, and I can\u2019t imagine what it\u2019s like to get a final Red One at the very end.</p> <p>We get to West Hampstead in about six minutes. Another ambulance is already on the scene, as well as team leader April Barter, who has come by car. I bumped into her earlier at the ambulance station in Camden, and she was complaining about having nothing to do that morning. Now she has something to do. A man in his 60s has had a cardiac arrest \u2013 a heart attack in which his heart has stopped completely \u2013 and the struggle is on to save him.</p> <p>The man is lucky. I hadn\u2019t realised where we were when we arrived, but then it dawns on me \u2013 it\u2019s a bridge club, and dozens of middle-aged and elderly card players are watching the paramedics\u2019 attempts to revive their fellow participant. Even before the first crew arrived, some medically trained members of the club had starting giving him CPR (cardiopulmonary resuscitation), that pounding of the chest that aims to kick the heart back into action. Without their prompt action, he would be dead. The paramedics continue the CPR \u2013 by now his chest looks as if it has caved in, but apparently this is quite normal \u2013 and administer defibrillation, an electric shock designed to correct his heart rhythm.</p> <p>After half an hour of attention, his heart is functioning again and he can be taken to hospital. He is still unconscious, but has a reasonable chance of surviving. His bridge partner, who tells me they had just played a very successful rubber, offers to go to hospital with him, while his wife is given the news at home. There is an impressive calm at the club as the man is carried out. Who knew bridge could be an extreme sport \u2013 or bridge players so unflappable?</p> <p>A cardiac arrest involving two crews generates an especially large volume of paperwork, and we are stuck outside the Royal Free for more than an hour while all the forms are filled in. Soon after we deliver the man to the hospital\u2019s heart centre, Barter tells me he has regained consciousness. \u201cThe fact he\u2019s awake, his eyes are open, he\u2019s moving around tells us his brain has more oxygen. Although potentially it has been starved of oxygen for a short period of time, that\u2019s a really positive sign and it\u2019s a potentially good outcome for him. That\u2019s a massive lift for us. Good times.\u201d She says she is \u201cbuzzing\u201d. \u201cIf I can make a difference to one person in a day, then I go home happy,\u201d Donovan told me earlier. It looks as if he and his colleagues have made that difference today.</p> <p>It is that difference, rather than the material rewards of the job, that attracts Lowes and Donovan. \u201cYou don\u2019t do this job if you want money,\u201d says Lowes, who is 37 and comes from the north-east of England. \u201cIt has other benefits. You go home and you sleep at night. You don\u2019t take any work home with you. You might take some kind of emotional stuff away at the end of the day but, as far as the working day is concerned, once you\u2019re finished, you\u2019re finished.\u201d</p> <p>Lowes, who is a fully qualified paramedic, tells me he earned \u00a336,000 last year. Thirty-year-old Donovan, a friendly, buoyant east Londoner who is one rung below his partner in terms of clinical qualifications, says he earns \u00a320,000 a year basic, which rises to about \u00a328,000 with the inner-London allowance, rest-break compensation (they will typically work through their breaks) and overtime, lots of overtime. They are contracted to work 37-and-a-half hours a week, but can do up to 56. Without the overtime, they would struggle financially. The staff need the relentless pressure on the service to earn enough to live.</p> <p>The upside, apart from the drama of the job and the satisfaction of saving lives and helping people at moments of crisis, is the flexibility. \u201cThere are a lot of other things out there that I wouldn\u2019t want to do, sitting behind a desk being one of them,\u201d says Donovan. \u201cAt least in this job you\u2019ve got a little bit of freedom. Once you\u2019re out on the road, you\u2019re your own boss.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/healthcare-network/2016/mar/03/my-life-as-a-paramedic-when-every-second-counts\">My life as a paramedic: when every second counts</a> </p> </aside>  <p>While the paperwork for the cardiac arrest case is being done, I talk to Gary Nicholls, one of the paramedics in the first crew to arrive. He has clocked up almost 24 years on the job \u2013 Lowes and Donovan have each done seven. \u201cYou never know what the next call is going to be,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s what keeps us interested. But it doesn\u2019t matter what comes down on the screen, we can always deal with it. The workload can be relentless, but your colleagues are there to get you through the shift.\u201d</p> <p>The London ambulance service was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/nov/27/london-ambulance-service-special-measures-care-quality-commission\">put into \u201cspecial measures\u201d</a> last year because of a number of failings, including staff shortages, poor response times, lack of leadership and concern that the service was ill-prepared to deal with a major terrorist attack. The cynic in me thinks the BBC series \u2013 and my ride in the ambulance today \u2013 are part of the PR fightback, and maybe they are, but there is no doubting the commitment of the dozen or so paramedics and backup staff I meet. This is a service under pressure, but by no means one that has lost heart. Nicholls really does believe they can deal with anything, including his first job that day \u2013 chasing a naked man who it was feared was high on drugs across Hampstead Heath.</p> <p>It is already well past 1pm. The complexity of the jobs, the paperwork and the fact that you need a bit of a breather mean crews will only do four or five callouts in a nine-hour shift, and six or eight in a 12-hour one. Just before 1.30pm, Donovan and Lowes go green again. This time it\u2019s a Red Two \u2013 slightly less urgent but still potentially life-threatening, a woman in Kilburn with chest pains and breathing problems.</p> <p>She is sitting on the stairs of her house when we arrive six minutes later. She looks remarkably well, and within about two minutes of arriving Lowes has diagnosed an anxiety attack. She had a heart bypass operation five years earlier, and clearly fears a heart attack. She has already been to hospital for a checkup that day, and now wants to go back, despite getting the all-clear earlier. It is unlikely there is a serious problem, but Lowes and Donovan can\u2019t take any chances, so take her to the Royal Free. It\u2019s not their most productive couple of hours, but they talk to her respectfully, calm her down, deliver her to A&amp;E and fill in a fresh set of forms.</p> <p>It\u2019s now 3 o\u2019clock, and we\u2019re on our way back to Kilburn. This time they\u2019ve received a less urgent C2 call, after an earlier Red One to another fatality was aborted. The monitor in the ambulance advises \u201cman in his 70s with severe behavioural change\u201d. When we get to the flat, we find an elderly man close to collapse \u2013 probably through dehydration \u2013 and his wife at the end of her tether. She thinks he has undiagnosed dementia, and there are suggestions he can be violent towards his family, though today he can barely raise himself from the sofa.</p> <p>It is an example of the social work side of paramedics\u2019 work. They check him over physically, but he is in reasonable shape apart from the dehydration. What he may need very soon is a place in a care home. That is the shadow that falls across the conversation Lowes has in the corridor with the man\u2019s wife \u2013 the sad but all-too-common conclusion of a 50-year marriage \u2013 while Donovan talks to the man\u2019s son about sport.</p> <p>As their appearance in the BBC series shows, they are very good at being de facto social workers, counselling the anxious, the elderly, the confused, the demented. \u201cWhen I first started this job, going into people\u2019s homes took a bit of getting used to,\u201d says Donovan, \u201cbut because you\u2019re wearing a uniform, in the eyes of the public you\u2019re a goodie. You\u2019re welcomed into most situations, whether it\u2019s for social reasons or for emergencies.\u201d</p> <p>Lowes calls the man\u2019s GP, who promises to come round. For the moment, there is nothing more that can be done. More paperwork and another cigarette in the afternoon sun. The shift is drawing to a close, and the crew do not fancy any red roulette. There is a general callout for an ambulance, any ambulance, to go to Victoria station, where a girl has fainted. They decide it\u2019s too far and head back to base. That\u2019s enough excitement for the day.</p> <p>As we drive back to Camden, their monitor is reporting that University College hospital has been temporarily closed, St Mary\u2019s in Paddington is accordingly under severe pressure and the Royal Free is \u201cbreaching\u201d \u2013 A&amp;E is missing its waiting targets and patients are being left in ambulances longer than they should be. It\u2019s going to be quite a night shift, and Lowes and Donovan are happy to be out of it. But tomorrow they will be back, and who knows where the spin of the roulette wheel will take them?</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/proginfo/2016/39/ambulance\"><em>Ambulance</em></a><em> starts on BBC1 at 9pm on 27 September. </em></p> <p><em>In the UK, the Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123.

  "<p>The contest is over, the result was decisive and the question of the Labour leadership is settled. So Jeremy Corbyn is right to move things on and put the Labour party on a general election footing, given that this may well come next May or sooner. It is a recognition that, while creating a \u201csocial movement\u201d has its place, the primary function of a political party is to seek to implement its values in government. How else could we have established the modern welfare state, the NHS, the Equal Pay Act, the minimum wage and more?</p> <p>Divided parties don\u2019t win elections, but the unity we need won\u2019t come through demands and threats. It will come through dialogue and understanding. That is why the nod and wink given by the leadership to threats of deselecting good, hardworking, popular MPs must cease. Our leader has already said he sees no need to change the rules on the selection of parliamentary candidates, so he shut down that counterproductive debate by making it clear that the only talk of removing MPs that will be entertained is replacing Tories with Labour ones at the next general election.</p> <p>Believe it or not, we all share the same values in the Labour party, but there will always be differences of opinion on policy \u2013 that is in the nature of the broad-church political parties we have under our flawed first-past-the-post electoral system. We can\u2019t win under FPTP if any one strand of the Labour tradition is forced out of the party for not being slavishly \u201con message\u201d(I thought we had rightly given \u201ccontrol freakery\u201d the boot several years ago) \u2013 we need to build a coalition of support spanning from left to centre-left to be successful.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We can address immigration without aping and accepting the division and prejudice peddled by Ukip</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>There are some MPs who will choose to rejoin the frontbench. Fine. Some, like me, will seek to hold the executive to account through parliament\u2019s increasingly important select committees \u2013 as Margaret Hodge and Tom Watson did in the last parliament in respect of the Murdoch press and big multinationals on tax. Others will run campaigns from the backbenches, like Stella Creasy\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2012/nov/25/stella-creasy-labour-wonga\">crusade against loan sharks</a>. Wes Streeting recently tabled no fewer than <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/sep/06/labour-mp-wes-streeting-higher-education-bill-amendments-nus\">30 amendments to make the higher education bill work</a> for students. There are many ways of contributing, and all are vital parts of Labour\u2019s campaign for social justice.</p> <p>To win at the next election we have to be future-facing and relevant to those we represent \u2013 and those we aspire to represent, too. Currently we fail this test. So we must all drag ourselves out of the trenches and look forward. This starts with dumping the obsession with redundant labels, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/sep/20/labour-launches-tougher-policy-on-tsunami-of-online-abuse\">ending the online thuggery and abuse </a>to which too many lifelong Labour members have been subject. \u201cBlairite\u201d is a redundant term \u2013 Tony Blair ceased to be leader almost a decade ago and New Labour is over. Calling Labour people \u201cTories\u201d, \u201cRed Tories\u201d or \u201cTory-lite\u201d is not only juvenile but hardly sends the right message to the millions of people who voted Tory last time whose support we need to form a Labour government \u2013 giving potential converts to our cause the impression we think they are the devil incarnate is a curious way to win them over.</p> <p>And to be relevant it is no good endlessly talking about the things we like to talk about to those with whom we agree. In order to grow our support and win an election, I want to see our leadership addressing our weaknesses and engaging on the difficult issues where many take a different view from us. You cannot duck the difficult issues in the middle of an election campaign. True courage requires us to find a Labour response that talks to those concerns, heals the divisions in society and is consistent with our values.</p> <p>It is extraordinary \u2013 given that a <a href=\"https://yougov.co.uk/news/2016/06/27/how-britain-voted/\">third of Labour voters opted to leave the European Union</a> and took a different view from the party\u2019s official position on the EU referendum \u2013 that immigration hardly featured during this year\u2019s leadership contest. As democrats, we should not ignore the referendum result, which is why I disagree with calls for a second referendum. Nor should we patronise those who voted to leave by simply dismissing them as bigoted and racist.</p> <p>This does not mean aping and accepting the division and prejudice peddled by Ukip \u2013 that should always be challenged. But it does mean recognising that, while immigration has brought huge benefits, it has also posed challenges to local labour markets and to community cohesion. But it need not do so if we put in place the right policies to support communities and move away from a laissez-faire approach to integration.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/22/jeremy-corbyn-not-unpopular-but-divisive\">Professor John Curtice</a>, the pollster who came closest to predicting the result of the 2015 general election, found that it was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/may/21/pollster-john-curtice-warns-labour-majority-2020-election-improbable-politics\">concern about our ability to provide competent government</a>, particularly on the economy \u2013 aside from any considerations of ideological positioning \u2013 that did most to deny us office in last year\u2019s election.

  "<p>Off the coast of San Diego, America\u2019s eighth largest city, commercial fishermen harvest about 1,100 metric tons of seafood from the Pacific every year.<br></p> <p>That sounds like a lot. But it isn\u2019t much to Don Kent, who says he can do better with just one fish farm.</p> <p>If Kent gets his way, he would raise 5,000 metric tons of yellowtail jack and white sea bass in a grid of net pens measuring about a square mile, anchored four miles off San Diego in federal waters. The species are prized in Southern California sushi restaurants, which now serve their customers imported fish almost exclusively, most of it from China, Japan, Greece or Chile.</p> <p>The US<a href=\"http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/aquaculture/aquaculture_in_us.html\"> imports</a> about 91% of its seafood. Whether consumers know it or not, about half of that is farmed in aquaculture facilities much like the one Kent wants to build. While the federal government has permitted shellfish farming for years, it didn\u2019t allow farming of finfish such as bass and salmon until earlier this year.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/aug/15/wild-caught-salmon-seafood-sustainable-alaska-fishing\">This Colorado poet is disrupting Alaska\u2019s commercial fishing industry</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cWhy are we buying all of our yellowtail from farms in Japan when I could grow them four miles off our coast and lower the carbon footprint and the trade deficit at the same time?\u201d says Kent, president and CEO of<a href=\"http://rosecanyonfisheries.com/\"> Rose Canyon Fisheries</a>, which aims to build the project. \u201cThis is done around the world. It\u2019s just not done here.\u201d</p> <p>But Kent isn\u2019t likely to get approval soon, because the location is all wrong. The government is eager to promote offshore fish farming to alleviate pressure on overfished wild species. But it wants that to happen first in the Gulf of Mexico. The National Marine Fisheries Service adopted its first rules for finfish farming in federal waters for the gulf region in January this year. Next up is the Pacific Islands region around Guam, Hawaii and Samoa, where in August the agency began preparing a report to analyze the environmental impact of aquaculture.</p> <p>The mismatch between the proposal\u2019s location and the new rules reflects the government\u2019s difficulties in incubating a new industry. Kent\u2019s proposal, first submitted in October 2014, is the only fish farm proposal that the federal government has received so far. A lawsuit filed in February contends the new rules for the Gulf of Mexico could significantly harm the environment and commercial fishing, and it may be keeping away potential applicants who want to wait for the case\u2019s resolution before filing plans.</p> <p>\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t be doing this on an industrial scale until we have better information,\u201d says Marianne Cufone, a professor of environmental law at Loyola Law School in New Orleans. \u201cIt\u2019s very possible the Gulf of Mexico will be altered forever if we move forward.\u201d</p> <p>Raising fish in coastal farms isn\u2019t a new phenomenon. It just hasn\u2019t happened yet in federal waters, which range from 3-200 miles offshore. Several states allow aquaculture in coastal waters under their control, which extend out three miles from shore, including Maine, Washington and Hawaii.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5028941c1cc18ce4c6bb32da715ab8e2abdf853c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5028941c1cc18ce4c6bb32da715ab8e2abdf853c/0_0_1024_731/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Aquaculture net pen operated by Blue Ocean Mariculture near Kona, Hawaii.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"714\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Aquaculture net pen operated by Blue Ocean Mariculture near Kona, Hawaii.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: NOAA Fisheries</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Sales by the US aquaculture industry totaled about $1.3bn in 2013, according to a periodic<a href=\"https://www.agcensus.usda.gov/Publications/2012/Online_Resources/Aquaculture/\"> census</a> by the US Department of Agriculture. That\u2019s a 25% increase over the prior census in 2005. Finfish account for about half the total, with catfish and trout \u2013 both freshwater species \u2013 dominating the industry.</p> <p>Offshore aquaculture works mostly the same everywhere: fish live in an enclosure created with nets that dangle underwater from floating rings or platforms on the surface. The whole apparatus is anchored to the ocean floor.</p> <p>The fish remain in the nets for as long as two years, from the time they are fingerlings. They are fed a diet that may include other fish \u2013 waste from canneries and commercial fishing \u2013 and processed pellets that may include corn, soybeans and other vegetables along with fish byproducts.</p> <p>The US is currently a small player in running coastal fish farms, though its long coastlines and<a href=\"http://www.afdf.org/wp-content/uploads/14d-The-Political-Economics-of-Marine-Aquaculture-in-the-US-Knapp-and-Rubino-2016.pdf\"> appetite for seafood could change that</a>.<a href=\"http://www.fao.org/3/a-i5798e.pdf\"> Norway leads the world</a>, followed by China, Chile, Indonesia and the Philippines, according to the UN Food and Agriculture Organization.</p> <p>Opening up the far offshore could ease the nation\u2019s trade imbalance in fish commerce and rebuild waterfront industries that have slipped away as a result of overfishing, says Dianne Windham, aquaculture coordinator for the West Coast region of the National Marine Fisheries Service.</p> <p>\u201cI think we actually have a great opportunity here to pursue the responsible and sustainable development of offshore aquaculture, and set the standard for what it ought to look like,\u201d Windham says.</p> <p>The opportunity was slow to materialize, though. The new rules for the Gulf of Mexico took 14 years to complete. Congress repeatedly considered \u2013 and then failed \u2013 to pass legislation to legalize offshore fish farming. So the fisheries services stepped in to regulate the industry under the<a href=\"http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/sfa/laws_policies/msa/\"> Magnuson-Stevens</a> Fishery Conservation and Management Act, a law passed in 1976 to govern commercial fishing.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a wonderful opportunity for the Gulf of Mexico, but it\u2019s been a long time coming,\u201d says Joe Hendrix, president of Seafish Mariculture in Houston, Texas, an aquaculture consulting group. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to implement these things because of a lot of ignorant people who have misplaced concerns.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e9a78db4ff6663346b00f21f9c74b26be46a0f87\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e9a78db4ff6663346b00f21f9c74b26be46a0f87/0_0_3072_2064/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Adult yellowtail, one of the species Rose Canyon wants to farm off the San Diego coast.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"672\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Adult yellowtail, one of the species Rose Canyon wants to farm off the San Diego coast.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rose Canyon Fisheries</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Hendrix is referring to critics who say their concerns are very real. This includes the risk of farmed fish escaping from their nets and breeding with wild fish and competing for food; water contamination \u201chot spots\u201d caused by fish excrement leaving the nets; and pharmaceuticals and genetic modifications used in some aquaculture operations. (The US Food and Drug Administration allows<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/319323/Opinion_on_the_welfare_of_farmed_fish.pdf\"> 18 different drugs</a> to be used on farmed fish).</p> <p>For instance, the new federal rules for the Gulf of Mexico require permit holders to report to the government only \u201cmajor escapement events\u201d, defined as 10% or more of cultured fish escaping from a pen. Anything less doesn\u2019t require reporting but may still disrupt the feeding and breeding of wild species.</p> <p>Interbreeding is a concern because farmed fish become a weaker genetic line, less able to avoid illness and parasites and to survive the hardships of the open ocean.</p> <p>\u201cTo date, we\u2019ve been unsuccessful in preventing escape from aquaculture facilities,\u201d says Cufone, who is also executive director of the<a href=\"http://www.recirculatingfarms.org/\"> Recirculating Farms Coalition</a>, a nonprofit that promotes aquaponics, a type of aquaculture in which fish and food crops are grown together. The group is also a plaintiff in the lawsuit to halt the aquaculture rules for the gulf. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason to think we would be 100% successful in the Gulf of Mexico, either.\u201d</p> <p>Examples of escapes are plentiful. In January 2015, for example, some 51,000 farmed Atlantic<a href=\"https://www.asf.ca/public-kept-in-dark-on-aquaculture-isa-and-escapes-in-nb.html\"> salmon escaped</a> from their pens off the coast of New Brunswick, Canada. In another case, farmed salmon have been found in Canada\u2019s Magaguadavic River and the rivers of British Columbia during spawning season.</p> <p>Hendrix and others in the industry counter that escaped fish are not a problem because, raised in pens and hand-fed, they lack the \u201cfitness\u201d to survive for long in the open ocean. In other words, they\u2019ll be eaten by wild fish before they have a chance to compete for food or interbreed.</p> <p>The new aquaculture rules for the Gulf of Mexico also have no conditions governing fish welfare or humane treatment of fish. Other nations, including<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/319323/Opinion_on_the_welfare_of_farmed_fish.pdf\"> Great Britain</a>, have recognized that fish feel pain and stress, and that aquaculture facilities should be designed and managed to prevent such suffering.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/may/11/seafood-industry-sustainable-fishing-salmon-overfishing\">Reeling it in: global sustainable seafood market hits $11.5bn</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The US federal government should have fish welfare rules in place before opening the sea to aquaculture, says Bernard Rollin, a professor of ethics and animal sciences at Colorado State University.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s well known by fish biologists that fish are enormously susceptible to stress, noise and crowding,\u201d says Rollin, a pioneer in the field of agricultural animal welfare. \u201cIf you screw it up, they\u2019ll all die.\u201d</p> <p>The fight over developing a sustainable industry means a longer wait for fish farm developers like Kent, who grew up in San Diego and remembers the city waterfront was once known as \u201cTuna Town\u201d because it served a huge tuna fishing fleet with businesses that built boats, repaired equipment, caught and processed fish. That work mostly left for Asia when regulations and public sentiment arose in the 1970s against the bycatch of dolphins by tuna fishermen.</p> <p>\u201cSo you\u2019ve got a working waterfront where the only work it\u2019s doing is entertaining people. It\u2019s not feeding people,\u201d says Kent, who is also CEO of Hubbs-SeaWorld Research Institute, a nonprofit arm of SeaWorld Parks and Entertainment.</p> <p>Kent says his $50m Rose Canyon project would generate 200 jobs for the region and employ newer cage technology that is submersible, a design that prevents the cages from getting destroyed by tussling waves during storms.</p> <p>Rose Canyon already faces opposition from environmental groups, and commercial fishermen are concerned that aquaculture could affect the wild fishery.</p> <p>Peter Halmay, a commercial fisherman based in San Diego and founder of the<a href=\"http://communityfisheriesnetwork.net/SDFWG.html\"> San Diego Fishermen\u2019s Working Group</a>, worries that farmed fish could develop viruses during captivity that would be released into the ocean and devastate native fish.</p> <p>He\u2019d rather see the government continue working to revitalize commercial fishing. For example, catch limits have been in place for years to limit harvest of important species, especially numerous varieties of rockfish. These programs have been successful, he says, and it will soon be time to increase catch limits again, a move that holds a lot of promise for the industry.</p> <p>\u201cOur vision is for a vibrant working waterfront based on the capture of wild fish,\u201d Halmay said. \u201cOnly if this project is a supplement to this vision will it work.\u201d</p>",

She scrambled up, confused.</p> <p>\u201cI felt for my keys in my bag; my knees were wobbly. When I pulled my keys out, I couldn\u2019t see them properly \u2013 everything was blurry. I must have realized there had been some sort of blast, because I wondered if my glasses had been blown off. But they were intact.\u201d</p> <p>On Friday, sitting in her sunlit sixth-floor studio, Ayeh put her hand to her glasses. She recalled her realisation that there was glass underfoot and one of her sandals was broken. She had put one hand up to her right eye.</p> <p>\u201cIt was all wet. I saw blood and that\u2019s when I freaked out. I ran into the road shouting, \u2018Help, help\u2019. Some man came up and put his arm around me. I learned later that it was plainclothes police officer.\u201d</p> <p>Six days after a bomb exploded directly opposite her apartment building, Ayeh\u2019s right eye is still vividly bloodshot, with dark bruising below. She is one of 31 people who were injured when the Chelsea bomb exploded, at around 8.30pm on Saturday 18 September. Shortly after that, another pressure cooker bomb was retrieved, unexploded, from 27th Street. New York City went on full alert. A terrorist was likely at large.</p> <h2><strong>\u201cI\u2019ve heard nothing, zilch\u2019</strong></h2> <p>On Monday morning, prime suspect <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/23/ahmad-khan-rahami-pakistan-taliban-new-york-bombing-terrorism\">Ahmad Khan Rahami</a>, 28, was arrested in Linden, New Jersey. An Afghan-born US citizen, he has been charged in connection with both New York bombs and several explosives that were found in New Jersey. Two of those devices exploded \u2013 no one was hurt.</p> <p>As Ayeh spoke on Friday, Rahami was still in hospital, having been shot and seriously wounded during his arrest. He had yet to appear before a judge. His father, Mohammad Rahami, said he had warned the FBI his son was a potential terrorist, but they did not interview Ahmad.</p> <p>It is believed Ahmad Khan Rahami may have become radicalized on visits to Pakistan, where he spent time studying in an area where the Taliban has a heavy presence, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/23/ahmad-khan-rahami-pakistan-taliban-new-york-bombing-terrorism\">the Guardian revealed on Friday</a>.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/sep/20/father-ahmad-rahami-bombing-fbi-2014-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/53qfm\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2735635\"            data-video-name=\"Father of bombing suspect says he contacted FBI in 2014 \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"Reuters\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57e17f50e4b05714d0da2be5\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/09/20/160920father_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/09/20/160920father.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/09/20/160920father_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/sep/20/father-ahmad-rahami-bombing-fbi-2014-video\">Father of bombing suspect says he contacted FBI in 2014</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>The 23rd Street bomb was filled with ball bearings, but it did not kill anyone. Nonetheless, while the sense among New Yorkers is that their city has had a lucky escape, Ayeh and others spent time in in four hospitals, spread across Manhattan.</p> <p>A handful of those injured declined medical attention. Others were bleeding profusely from lacerations, pierced by shrapnel, nursing concussions and broken teeth or, in the case of a woman who had been driving on 23rd Street with her boyfriend, wondering whether her unborn baby would be OK.</p> <p>Ayeh said on Friday that when people were killed, many forget the injured. Even in this case, where, perhaps miraculously, no one died, nobody from the city authorities had been in contact with Ayeh since the bombing.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve heard nothing, zilch,\u201d she said, though she commended authorities for finding the suspect and capturing him alive.</p> <p>She was shocked, she said, that although New York mayor Bill de Blasio had been on the scene on 23rd Street in the days after the bombing, he had not, so far as she was aware, contacted those who were injured. She certainly had not heard from anyone from city or state government. FBI agents had been \u201cvery sweet\u201d, she said, and had checked up on her. Someone even left a bunch of Get Well balloons outside her apartment.</p> <p>After the blast, Ayeh said, she was quickly bundled into an ambulance. \u201cFirst thing I asked the medic inside was, \u2018Is my eye still there?\u2019 and she said it was.\u201d</p> <p>The bleeding wouldn\u2019t stop. Ayeh\u2019s white T-shirt and shorts were soaked. The paramedic told her to close both her eyes and stay still.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The paramedic said, \u2018Do you believe in God?\u2019 and I said \u2018yes\u2019, and she said \u2018pray\u2019.

I could feel the blood dripping on to my arm.\u201d</p> <p>At the hospital, a nurse called one of Ayeh\u2019s friends. Ayeh recalled a \u201cprecious moment\u201d of relief when her friend Sylvia arrived.</p> <p>She was still dazed and in pain. She waited on a stretcher for several hours. She was given a Cat scan and a specialist examined her. She had also hurt her knee, her right arm and her wrists and hands, though not seriously.</p> <p>There were no splinters of glass, metal or other shrapnel in her eye. The main cut was in the eyelid. Hospital staff stitched her up and gave her some fresh clothes. Then she was released.</p> <p>She had been holding on to her purse with a death grip, she said, but although she had her ID and keys, law enforcement officers would not allow her back on to her block. She showed them the bloodied clothes in her bag and bandaged head. No dice.</p> <p>\u201cSo I just wandered the streets,\u201d she said. She had a coffee, then when her gym opened at 8am she sat in there for while. Around 11am she begged a police officer to escort her to her apartment. She succeeded, and has since been interviewed by the FBI.</p> <h2><strong>\u2018It\u2019s rough. I\u2019m not sure of my next step\u2019</strong></h2> <p>As a freelance architect, Ayeh specializes in residential buildings. She had been taken on for a project that would last until the end of the year, and on Monday, despite pain and a burning sensation in her swollen eye, she went to the office. After 10 minutes, she knew her blurry vision meant she could not read documents or a computer screen. She was let go from the project.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/19/new-york-city-blind-home-chelsea-bombing-selis-manor\">New York City's only home for blind people damaged during Chelsea bombing</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cI understand,\u201d she said. \u201cArchitects have deadlines and I was commissioned because they needed someone immediately, so they could not delay while I healed \u2026 but it\u2019s rough.

  "<p>The spectacular staging of <em>War Horse</em>, with lifelike equine puppets, has been seen by more than seven million people worldwide since it premiered at the National Theatre in 2007. Now its director is reuniting with some of the original puppeteers for an ambitious production loosely based on a story by 19th-century French writer Victor Hugo.</p> <p>Tom Morris is staging <em>The Grinning Man</em>, a tragicomic musical with extraordinary human and wolf puppets brought to life by Finn Caldwell and Toby Oli\u00e9, who met as <em>War Horse</em> performers.</p> <p>The production will premiere on 20 October as part of celebrations for the 250th anniversary of the Bristol Old Vic \u2013 once described by actor Peter O\u2019Toole as the world\u2019s \u201cloveliest\u201d theatre \u2013 of which Morris is artistic director.</p> <p><em>The Grinning Man</em> is inspired by <em>The Man Who Laughs</em>, an 1869 novel by Victor Hugo, whose masterpieces include <em>Les Mis\u00e9rables</em> and <em>The Hunchback of Notre-Dame</em>.</p> <p>The plot concerns a dark fairy story about a man tormented by a quest to discover how his face became disfigured as a child, twisting his features into a \u201chideous grin\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"8f3bbf763447166225bc0196e74a4c0ec260196d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8f3bbf763447166225bc0196e74a4c0ec260196d/763_0_2662_3328/800.jpg\" alt=\"Toby Olie\u0301 in War Horse\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Toby Olie\u0301 in War Horse</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There are three main puppet characters \u2013 a boy, a girl and a howling, growling wolf. Each is worked by two or three puppeteers, who control movements, sounds and emotions.</p> <p>Morris said that puppets gave maximum imaginative scope to theatre audiences. \u201cThe unique thing about any live performance is what the audience might do to transform what they see,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cIn film, you\u2019re able to give a fantastic detail of imagery to an audience who are responding to it emotionally. In theatre, what you see on stage is a tiny part of the imagined reality of the story. The more the audience imagine, the more they will feel when the characters they\u2019ve invested in imaginatively have an experience of whatever kind. Puppetry is the most extreme form of that.\u201d</p> <p>Oli\u00e9 added: \u201cWe want the audience to invest in the puppets, like they\u2019re real characters. To imbue them with life, thought and breath, in the same way that we did with <em>War Horse</em> and their puppets.\u201d</p> <p>The new musical includes \u201ca beauty-and-the-beast-type love story\u201d between the grinning man and the blind girl, who has grown up into a beautiful woman. The story also explores tough themes such as adoption and whether parents should hide a child\u2019s past and the impact of extreme disfigurement.</p> <p>Morris is associate director of the National Theatre, where he co-directed <em>War Horse </em>\u2013 an epic story of horses on the front line in the first world war \u2013 with Marianne Elliott, in a collaboration with the Handspring Puppet Company. Such is its popularity that a major UK tour begins in 2017.</p> <p>He said that <em>War Horse</em> has inspired a generation of British puppeteers to realise the possibilities of puppetry and theatrical storytelling.</p> <p>Human puppets are almost more difficult to create than equine ones, Oli\u00e9 said, as the audience is much more sensitive to what looks real.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a challenge not to make these human figures too \u2018puppety\u2019,\u201d he said. \u201cNot to have a sense of a marionette, a wobbly Thunderbirds-style of human puppets, but to give them as much weight and a \u2018relatability\u2019 that people had with the horses, where an ear flick and tail swish had that whole [audience] hooked.\u201d</p> <p>The challenge is to inspire the audience to fill in the blanks through their own imaginations, he added.</p>",
  "<p>La Cressonniere, who had been France\u2019s best hope of a home victory in next Sunday\u2019s Prix de l\u2019Arc de Triomphe, will miss the race. The unbeaten winner of the French Oaks was found to have a minor injury after exercise on Saturday and will be treated with anti-inflammatories which will not clear the filly\u2019s system in time for her to take part.</p> <p>\u201cThere is a problem, not a very strong problem but we had to do treatment and that means we cannot run her on Sunday,\u201d said her trainer, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/11/makahiki-prix-de-larc-de-triomphe-chantilly-aidan-obrien-derby-curragh-horse-racing\" title=\"\">Jean-Claude Rouget,</a> who is based in Pau. \u201cIt\u2019s not very important for the future but enough for her not to run on Sunday.</p> <p>\u201cWe don\u2019t know exactly what it is,\u201d added Rouget, who suggested the problem may originate in the filly\u2019s pelvis or vertebrae. But he expects her to recover in time to play a full part in the 2017 season.</p> <p>La Cressonniere had been 5-1 second-favourite to give Rouget a first victory in the Arc. He immediately quashed speculation that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/10/almanzor-irish-champion-stakes-christophe-soumillon-frankie-dettori\" title=\"\">Almanzor,</a> who is in the same ownership, might take her place in the Chantilly contest, saying: \u201cAlmanzor will not run. He will go to Ascot.\u201d</p> <p>Even so Almanzor shortened to 15-1 for the Arc on the Betfair betting exchange. The winner of the French Derby and a hotly contested Irish Champion Stakes, he had been trading above 40-1 prior to the news about his stablemate. His Ascot target is the Champion Stakes on 15 October, for which he is 5-2 favourite.</p> <p>Postponed shortened to 2-1 from 11-4 for the Arc after La Cressonniere was ruled out. The five-year-old was reported in good health by his Newmarket trainer, Roger Varian, who was pleased by his final bit of fast work on Saturday.</p> <p>\u201cHe went well over nine furlongs and Andrea [Atzeni] was very happy with him,\u201d Varian said. \u201cHe\u2019ll do routine exercise every day and he might have a blow before the race but the bulk of his main work is done now and hopefully we\u2019ll get a smooth run from here.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a relief to get to this stage, obviously. You can\u2019t go into these races undercooked, so a certain amount of tough work is required and unfortunately it can be in those tough bits of work that things can go wrong or problems can be revealed.\u201d</p> <p>A final bit of work on Tuesday morning will determine whether the Derby winner, Harzand, takes part in the Arc. The colt was injured when a rival struck into him in the Irish Champion this month and his trainer, Dermot Weld, hopes to see confirmation that the horse has recovered and is fit enough to take his chance in Europe\u2019s most prestigious Flat race.</p> <p>Weld has another possible runner in Fascinating Rock, the winner of last year\u2019s Champion Stakes at Ascot, whose target will also be determined on Tuesday. \u201cHarzand will do a bit of work on Tuesday, as will Fascinating Rock, and we\u2019ll make a decision after that,\u201d the Curragh trainer said. He added that Harzand would \u201cmost likely\u201d take part in the Arc, having appeared to make a good recovery from the incident just over a fortnight ago.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/20/james-doyle-loses-leading-saeed-bin-suroor-william-buick\">James Doyle loses leading role for Saeed bin Suroor as William Buick books in</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cHe had a V-shaped cut in a back leg and initially we thought he\u2019d need three stitches but we got away without it,\u201d Weld said. \u201cThere was a lot of bruising but he\u2019s healed well; he shows good healing, this horse. We\u2019ve got the bruising under control and he\u2019s back in full swing.\u201d</p> <p>Pressed as to whether the horse could be close to his peak fitness after such a preparation, Weld said: \u201cTime reveals all. Look, it was a hold-up. We\u2019d rather he hadn\u2019t had it but he\u2019s back in full swing now.\u201d</p> <p>Harzand has already shown remarkable powers of recovery, having spent the morning of the Derby with one foot in a bucket of ice, the consequence of pulling a shoe off during the journey to Epsom. He won again in the Irish Derby later in June but was having his first run since when injured in the Leopardstown race, finishing eighth of 12.</p> <p>Fascinating Rock was also beaten in his reappearance race after a midsummer break, finishing strongly but too late to catch Success Days at The Curragh in August. Having missed the Irish Champion because his blood was not quite right in the last few days beforehand, he could go to the Arc or back to Ascot a fortnight later.</p> <p>Weld pointed out that the five-year-old has won over the Arc\u2019s mile and a half but conceded that the shorter distance of the Champion Stakes is a better fit for the horse. \u201cHis best trip would appear to be 10 furlongs, I think we have to accept that. But he\u2019ll do a little bit of work on Tuesday and we\u2019ll make a call then.\u201d He has not decided who would ride in the event of Fascinating Rock lining up at Chantilly.</p> <p>Harzand is a 10-1 shot to give the 68-year-old Weld his first win in the Arc, while Fascinating Rock is generally on offer at 25-1.</p> <p>While Postponed has proved versatile as to ground, the early signs are that Harzand and Fascinating Rock may not get the cut underfoot at Chantilly that suits them best. \u201cI\u2019ll be surprised if they\u2019re not racing on something close to good,\u201d Varian said.</p> <p>\u201cIt was good for Trials Day [a fortnight ago] and it\u2019s been largely dry since. They\u2019re due a bit of rain today and it\u2019ll be dry thereafter, cooler temperatures but not cold.</p> <p>\u201cOf course, there have been a handful of times this year when we\u2019ve had that kind of forecast and then the complexion has changed completely by the time the weekend comes around.\u201d</p> <p>Aidan O\u2019Brien clarified his Arc plans, suggesting that the star filly Minding would skip the French race in favour of Champions Day at Ascot, where she has three possible targets. O\u2019Brien expects to rely on three others in the Arc: Order Of St George, winner of the Gold Cup at Royal Ascot, Highland Reel, whose year peaked with victory in the King George, and Found, who has been second in her last five races, including in the Irish Champion.</p> <p>O\u2019Brien presumably has alternative plans for Seventh Heaven, Idaho and US Army Ranger, who all feature in betting lists for the Arc.</p>",

He also embarked on an \u201coutreach\u201d effort aimed at some minority communities, suddenly incorporating into his stump speech lines about the plight of African American voters.</p> <p>But Trump\u2019s platform, his slate of signature policies, chief among them his ultra-hard line on immigration, has remained exactly the same. And at the debate, some opposed to Trump worry, such details may be lost.

I think Serantes gets there first, although he\u2019d have been penalised for handling a backpass, but the ball squirms loose from Rodrigo\u2019s challenge and breaks for Nani, who takes a touch and calmly beats the defender on the line. I think Valencia may have got a touch lucky there \u2013 but maybe, in their position, you need that kind of fortune.

  "<p>When polling stations closed at 10pm on the night of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/general-election-2015\">7 May 2015,</a> the bookies would have given generous odds on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/sep/24/ed-balls-waltz-strictly-come-dancing-bbc\">Ed Balls doing the waltz on Strictly Come Dancing</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/jeremy-corbyn\">Jeremy Corbyn leading the Labour party</a> less than 18 months later.</p> <p>Had things turned out a little differently, Balls would now be running the Treasury and Corbyn would have remained a backbench MP. Ed Miliband would have been at the head of a coalition government and there would have been no <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\">EU referendum.</a></p> <p>In the intervening period, Corbyn has won not one but two leadership contests, both by thumping majorities. His opponents in the party have been routed and he now has the job of getting Labour ready to fight the next election. That will be no easy task.</p> <p>Three months ago, the notion that the Conservative party would hold a double-digit opinion poll lead over the Labour party looked remote. David Cameron had just resigned after calling and losing the Brexit referendum and there were fears of a summer of financial and political chaos while the Tories chose a new prime minister. Labour had its problems but they appeared to be minor by comparison.</p> <p>The mood has now changed. Theresa May is enjoying a honeymoon period and political pundits assume that she will trounce Corbyn whenever she chooses to go to the country, whether that is at a snap election next spring or if the current parliament is allowed to run its full five-year course. The conventional wisdom is that Britain is facing another prolonged period of uninterrupted Conservative rule.</p> <p>But honeymoons - as Gordon Brown can testify - come to an end. Labour\u2019s last prime minister looked the part and had an assured start when he took over from Tony Blair in the summer of 2007. Then the financial crisis broke, there were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/sep/14/money2\">queues outside Northern Rock branches</a> and it was never the same again.</p> <p>May\u2019s honeymoon could turn out to be similarly brief. While the risk of an immediate recession has receded, it is possible that the government will make a hash of the Brexit negotiations when they eventually start. Before that, though, there is the possibility that the supposed cure for the last recession unwittingly creates the conditions for another painful downturn. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>This is what is happening. Interest rates are low everywhere and have been for years. The Bank of England, the Bank of Japan and the European Central Bank are still upping the amount of stimulus they are providing, even though it is almost a decade since the sub-prime mortgage crisis erupted in the summer of 2007.</p> <p>The only major central bank that is even thinking about tightening policy is the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/federal-reserve\">US Federal Reserve</a>. The Fed took the first tentative step towards the \u201cnormalisation\u201d of interest rates (around 5% was the pre-crisis norm) last December and sent out signals that the cost of borrowing would be pushed up several times during 2016.</p> <p>Since then, though, the Fed has sat tight even though unemployment is low and consumer spending is strong. With negligible wage pressure and last year\u2019s fall in the cost of energy holding inflation down, the Fed has said it wants to see further evidence that the economy is strengthening before moving again. Wall Street has taken that as a strong hint to be prepared for a December rate rise although, on past form, it won\u2019t take much for the Fed to again decide to leave policy unchanged.</p> <p>In theory, the ability to borrow for the long term at ultra-low rates should be providing an incentive for US businesses to invest. That, though, is not what is happening. Rather than invest, corporations are borrowing money in order to buy back their own shares. This makes sense because, as Charles Dumas of Lombard Street Research has pointed out, the cost of money is below the yield on stocks.</p> <p>But it also means the Fed has created the perfect conditions for a massive stock market bubble, which will pop the moment that interest rates start to rise. The US, courtesy of the dearth of investment, has weak productivity and inflation will start to pick up once growth accelerates to much more than 2%.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"32ffcba001766b07cb1670b6ae581ad9eeeac2c3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/32ffcba001766b07cb1670b6ae581ad9eeeac2c3/0_0_2208_3500/631.jpg\" alt=\"Ed Balls waltzing on Strictly Come Dancing\" width=\"631\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ed Balls waltzing on Strictly Come Dancing. Had things turned out differently on 7 May 2015, he would now be running the Treasury.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Guy Levy/BBC/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The fear of the majority of the Fed\u2019s policymakers is that an over-hasty move would send share prices sharply lower, leading to slower growth, higher unemployment and an undershoot of its inflation target. But delay means that the stock market bubble continues to inflate and that the bust \u2013 when it comes \u2013 will be even more severe. It is easy enough to envisage circumstances in which a panic on Wall Street leads to the second global recession in a decade.</p> <p>What would this mean for UK politics? Labour had two problems during the 2007-09 crash. The first was that it was in power when the banks nearly went bust. The second was that it was ill-prepared ideologically to challenge the basis upon which the global economy had been run for the previous 30 years. New Labour had bought into the idea that there was precious little governments could, or even should, do to tame the power of global finance.</p> <p>Clearly, Corbyn doesn\u2019t have the first of these problems. If there is another financial crisis, it is going to happen on May\u2019s watch. The more interesting question is whether Labour could respond to a fresh crisis with an economic programme that is intellectually coherent and politically attractive.</p> <p>This is a tall order. Labour does not tend to win power when times are tough; rather it wins during periods when the mood is optimistic and when the economy is strong, as in 1964 and 1997. In 1945, it was impossible to portray Labour\u2019s economic platform as dangerously radical, since state control of key industries had been necessary to win the war.</p> <p>The UK has the same economic weakness as the US: private investment has been too low even with interest rates at record lows. Corbyn\u2019s answer is higher public spending channeled through a national investment bank. There is nothing wrong with this. Indeed, it makes a lot of sense to remedy the UK\u2019s infrastructure deficiencies when borrowing is so cheap.</p> <p>Likewise, an idea that Corbyn floated in the 2015 leadership race - People\u2019s quantitative easing - would provide a useful policy weapon in the event of another severe financial crisis. There is little scope for central banks to cut interest rates further and the current QE programmes have encouraged speculation rather than investment. People\u2019s QE is a form of helicopter money: public investment financed by money creation by the Bank of England.</p> <p>But Labour has done little to turn higher borrowing or People\u2019s QE into mainstream ideas and is failing to counter the perception that it knows more about spending money than creating wealth. In that respect, Corbyn and Balls are alike: both are struggling to impress the judges. </p>",

  "<p>John Simpson has survived gunfire in Baghdad, Belgrade and Tiananmen Square; but the BBC\u2019s world affairs editor almost died from eating some dodgy haddock far closer to home.</p> <p>Three days after coming out of hospital, Simpson sits nursing a glass of red wine in an Oxford hotel still looking mildly surprised that some Monday morning kedgeree could have led to a doctor predicting his imminent demise. \u201cI\u2019ve been close to death a lot, but I\u2019ve never been close to death through natural causes,\u201d he says.</p> <p>With his face still a shade darker than his trademark linen jackets, the only sign of the near-fatal illness is a slightly weaker voice. Yet the fish combined with some pills he\u2019d been taking for decades ended in a \u201ckind of storm\u201d, blood poisoning and kidney failure. He spent 10 days in hospital and confounded the doctors by sitting up in bed within two days of the doctor\u2019s dire warning. \u201cI\u2019ll be back working soon,\u201d says the 72-year-old, before admitting that the doctors have advised him neither to rush back, nor drink.</p> <p>Set to celebrate 50 years working for the BBC this year, Simpson is not meant to be talking to the Guardian about his brush with death (he is saving that for a piece in a rival newspaper) but about his latest book.</p> <p>A potted history of foreign reporters interspersed with accounts from his own illustrious career \u2013 from travelling with Ayatollah Khomeini to Tehran in 1979 to entering Afghanistan in a burqa for wars in the 1980s and 1990s \u2013 Simpson describes the book as a \u201ctraining manual for a job that\u2019s virtually disappearing\u201d. </p> <p>He has no doubt that financial constraints combined with the rise of the smartphone has done for the sort of eyewitness, dusty-shoe reporting he and the heroes in his book have enjoyed.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a217b66fbd03b28197b87af303cf95f9a7c719ff\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a217b66fbd03b28197b87af303cf95f9a7c719ff/21_29_1030_744/1000.jpg\" alt=\"John Simpson in Chechnya in 1998.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"722\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">John Simpson in Chechnya in 1998.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThe money\u2019s gone,\u201d he says mournfully. \u201cI\u2019m sure that there\u2019ll be foreign news, of course ... But the grand tradition which goes back hundreds of years, it ain\u2019t going to go forward more than 20 or 30.\u201d</p> <p>He may agree that the book is a bit of a requiem and yet, his tales of midnight dashes and near misses during a conversation that lasts for two and a half hours is much more of a celebration.</p> <p>Rude about both government ministers and BBC management, he is too entertaining to pass for either. Swearing like a trooper, he refers to BBC managers as \u201cthe bastards\u201d or \u201cthe temporary staff\u201d and calls reports that he earns \u00a3800,000 a year \u201cfucking ridiculous\u201d.</p> <p>Yet he is BBC to the core. When he mentions how moved he was by his grown-up children (he also has a 10-year-old from his second marriage) weeping round his bedside, he admits: \u201cThey would have perfect right to feel I haven\u2019t put them first.\u201d What did he put first, I ask. \u201cThe bloody BBC! Nothing else. I certainly haven\u2019t put my wives or girlfriends first, God knows I haven\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>His experience of the NHS in Oxford made him think of the corporation. \u201cI saw lots of similarities between the NHS and the BBC. It\u2019s all about management systems now. I think a lot of the doctors find that quite hard but, more than anything else, it\u2019s all to do with government intervention and interference, that desire by [ministers] to prove, to demonstrate that they have not only got a grip on the place but a foot on the back of its neck.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a lack of maturity in politicians which makes them feel that their job is to battle the outfits that they\u2019re in charge of instead of saying how do we make this thing better?</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a disgraceful political obsession that somehow or other the BBC has to be cut down to size ... it\u2019s absolutely stupid.\u201d</p> <p>Have the past two years, in which the BBC has fought to renegotiate its royal charter, been worse than before? \u201cIt\u2019s always been bad and it\u2019s not even a party political thing,\u201d he says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"aac6ded18bf6bc713fefdb3b6474b81ba812d6e5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aac6ded18bf6bc713fefdb3b6474b81ba812d6e5/0_17_719_559/500.jpg\" alt=\"John Simpson during the Iraq war.\" width=\"500\" height=\"389\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">John Simpson limping away from the scene of a friendly fire attack, with half his trouser leg blown off, during the Iraq war.

Yet, here is the prime minister cosying up to that man against the main national broadcaster!\u201d</p> <p>In contrast, having interviewed David Cameron for GQ magazine in March, Simpson considers him \u201cpretty liberal-minded \u2013 he saw the value of having the BBC\u201d and he\u2019s reserving his judgment on Theresa May.</p> <p>One of the few things May and her new culture secretary have done since coming to power is insist that all those earning more than \u00a3150,000 are named in the corporation\u2019s annual report. Undoubtedly one of the 109 set to be identified, he brings up \u201cthis business now about how much people earn\u201d on his own. He doesn\u2019t \u201ccare terribly much\u201d, he says, yet he objects to the government \u201clooking for a way to demonstrate their control and domination\u201d.</p> <p>Admitting that he has earned more from books and columns, Simpson says: \u201cI fully accept you shouldn\u2019t join the BBC or work for the BBC in order to get rich.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not frightened of political control or bosses.

Yet Simpson is remarkably insecure about his future. Saying that director general Tony Hall could be \u201cgone soon\u201d, he quotes the Old Testament to explain his post-Hall fears: \u201cBut there rose up a pharaoh who knew not Joseph.\u201d </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2ca1a3120afbdb9ffaa6e171764c136bf79c464f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2ca1a3120afbdb9ffaa6e171764c136bf79c464f/493_918_3910_2346/1000.jpg\" alt=\"John Simpson\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Whenever the BBC has told Simpson not to go somewhere he has \u2018always ignored them\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Sillitoe/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He even flirted with going to a commercial rival \u2013 likely to be ITV \u2013 two years ago before realising it \u201cwouldn\u2019t suit really\u201d.

He calls the website \u201ca kind of a mistake\u201d set up by somebody acting on his behalf rather than by him.</p> <p>Simpson, who comes alive talking about being bustled across Syria with the Russian army this July (\u201cit was tremendous, enjoyable, difficult!\u201d), cannot be easy to manage. Whenever the BBC have told him not to go places he has \u201calways ignored them\u201d and tells the tale of being held in Syria for 24 hours after pretending to be an academic. </p> <p>His free-talking ways landed him in trouble when he was quoted describing BBC management as awful and full of \u201ctough women\u201d. He says the report elided two different points, but he wrote to senior female executives to apologise. Yet his comments that BBC staff aren\u2019t happy and that they treat junior staff members badly won\u2019t endear him to his bosses either.</p> <p>He uses his Irish passport for all the \u201cwild and woolly places\u201d where the UK is an enemy or where there is a risk of kidnap. The Irish government would be much more likely to \u201csee a PR advantage in trying to get me out,\u201d he says. \u201cI think the UK government would be glad to demonstrate their toughness and then no doubt send a junior minister to my funeral.\u201d</p> <p>I ask if there are any no-go areas, and immediately regret it. \u201cThere\u2019s nowhere I wouldn\u2019t go!

  "<p>Donald Trump\u2019s detractors have struggled to define him as long as he\u2019s been on the political scene. But in 2015 it was the famously tongue-tied Rick Perry who landed upon what seemed like the most accurate descriptor to date: he called Trump \u201ca cancer\u201d.<br><br>He was speaking in reference to conservatism and, rather amazingly, would later go on to <a href=\"http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2016/05/perry-tries-to-live-down-trump-cancer-comment.html\">support Trump</a>; he was also on to something. We know how cancer cells evade the body\u2019s natural response by basically disarming the immune system \u2013 turning it off or otherwise poisoning it.</p> <p>But the way this election is shaping up, the better analogy might be an autoimmune disease. Such illnesses result from our body\u2019s natural defenses being marshalled against it with destructive results. Trump is exploiting our political immune system to the detriment and potentially grave peril of the republic. He\u2019s taken what actually makes America great, the systems of government designed to foster public good \u2013 the courts, the press, our charity and financial systems \u2013 and used them for personal gain at the body politic\u2019s expense.</p> <p>You don\u2019t have to look far to find examples of Trump using the protective mechanisms of society to undermine it \u2013 and perhaps the most conspicuous example of it is the courts.</p> <p>They were designed as the legal instrument of justice: to prevent victimization; to accuse and punish evildoers; to protect wildlife and the environment from the tragedy of the commons. But Trump has perverted the system, hiring seasoned lawyers to bully his way to desired verdicts. (His $10m lawsuit against a Miss USA hopeful who wrote a Facebook post he disliked <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/04/sheena-monnin-donald-trump-miss-usa-lawsuit\">was just one</a> of an estimated 3,500 lawsuits involving Trump, according to a USA Today <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2016/06/01/donald-trump-lawsuits-legal-battles/84995854/\">tally</a>.)</p> <p>Recently he sought to impugn the authority of a judge ruling on the Trump University case, saying his Mexican heritage and involvement with a Latino lawyers\u2019 association posed \u201can absolute conflict\u201d.</p> <p>The courts aren\u2019t the only protective lever of government Trump may have attempted to exploit in order to shield himself \u2013 Florida\u2019s attorney general, Pam Bondi, received <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/06/10/politics/pam-bondi-donald-trump-donation/\">$25,000 from a Trump charity</a> before her office decided not to move forward with a review of his university.</p> <p>Like so many aspects of American democracy, charities \u2013 and specifically the tax-protected nature of donations from them \u2013 are meant to encourage us to take care of the country\u2019s vulnerable and protect people from the worst possible outcomes. And the Bondi donation is far from the only time Trump may have perverted his charities\u2019 use. A Washington Post investigation revealed that monies from the Trump Foundation have been used to <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/21/trump-foundation-charity-settle-legal-disputes-reporting\">settle legal disputes</a>. </p> <p>Trump has also found ways to subvert the financial system, and specifically its bankruptcy laws, for personal gain. The leniencies in bankruptcy law are meant to save people on hard times from complete financial destruction \u2013 allowing them to start over again. But for Trump they\u2019re <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jun/21/hillary-clinton/yep-donald-trumps-companies-have-declared-bankrupt/\">a modus operandi of sorts</a>. After four corporate bankruptcy filings, he was still a multi-billionaire.</p> <p>Then there are the ways he\u2019s used the press to his own ends. With its mission of truth-telling, journalism aims to protects society against illegal or otherwise destructive behavior by exposing it. But Trump, who parlayed the notoriety from his television persona on The Apprentice into a national political platform, exploits its weaknesses.</p> <p>His steady stream of lies is difficult to fact-check in real time, an advantage to him in debates and other events with live coverage. Moreover, he\u2019s worked to actively undermine people\u2019s trust in the press, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/02/26/donald-trump-vows-to-open-up-libel-laws-to-make-suing-the-media-easier-heres-how-he-could-do-it/\">vowing to \u201copen up\u201d libel laws</a> so reporters can be sued more easily.</p> <p>What keeps a democracy on course is believing its protective checks and balances \u2013 its immune system built up over years of evolution \u2013 will work to protect the whole. We need to believe the court systems strive for justice; that the government will represent the interests of the people and won\u2019t be bought; that the press can speak truth freely.</p> <p>Even if he loses in November, Trump will still continue to undermine trust in democracy \u2013 inciting the rage of his sometimes violent supporters with claims the election process is \u201crigged\u201d. It\u2019s a specter he and his have long floated; confidante Roger Stone predicts the ensuing chaos will be a \u201c<a href=\"http://www.mediaite.com/online/roger-stone-says-there-will-be-a-bloodbath-if-election-is-stolen-from-trump/\">bloodbath</a>\u201d.</p> <p>Such a thing, should it occur, would be a violation of what is perhaps the most basic tenet of democracy: that we vote to see what society agrees on, and once it\u2019s been determined, we uphold it whether or not we agree.<br></p> <p>Trump seems to have little interest in any such civic-mindedness. And it\u2019s no coincidence Vladimir Putin is the foreign leader he most admires. In systematically curtailing Russia\u2019s democratic freedoms, Putin has already achieved what Trump seeks: authoritarianism, the worst perversion of democracy.</p> <p>Especially troubling for anti-authoritarians is that even if we succeed in stopping Trump this fall, through our imperfect system of checks and balances or whatever mysterious magic moves the public mind, one thing is certain: considerable damage has already been done.</p>",
  "<p>Boris Johnson has said the NHS will get substantial extra funding after Brexit, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/04/theresa-may-refuses-to-guarantee-brexit-pledges-on-immigration-and-nhs\">despite Theresa May\u2019s refusal to endorse the leave campaign\u2019s promise </a>of an additional \u00a3100m a week.</p> <p>The foreign secretary strayed from his brief during BBC1\u2019s Andrew Marr show to sign up the prime minister to a cash injection for health services during this parliament.</p> <p>During the leave campaign, one of Johnson\u2019s central arguments was that leaving the EU would allow the UK to pump an extra \u00a3350m a week into the NHS, a figure that was later revised down to \u00a3100m. However, May declined to back that promise this month when she travelled to the G20 in Beijing.</p> <p>Johnson was pressed on the extra money for the NHS after Andrew Lansley, the former health secretary, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-37435648\">suggested at least \u00a35bn could be available to the NHS </a>after Brexit. Asked whether the government could guarantee a \u201creally substantial\u201d extra amount of money per week for the NHS by 2020, Johnson said: \u201cWell, yes, in the sense that clearly once we leave, and that isn\u2019t possible until the final moment that of the change in our arrangements, and we take back control of the budgets we contribute to the EU.</p> <p>\u201cOnce that happens, clearly it will be possible for the UK government to spend people\u2019s money on our priorities. And the number one priority for most people is the NHS. It sounds to me Andrew Lansley has got it right.\u201d</p> <p>Johnson also aired his views on when the UK should leave the EU, despite No 10 sources making clear last week that this was a decision for May alone. He said the process should not be allowed to drag on and the UK should be out before May 2019 to avoid a new batch of British MEPs being elected to Brussels. That would imply <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/25/article-50-brexit-debate-britain-eu\">article 50 </a>would have to be triggered before May next year to allow two years of negotiations to take place.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s Euro elections coming down the track, and people will be wondering whether we will be wanting to send a fresh batch of MEPs to an institution we are going to be leaving,\u201d Johnson said.</p> <p>He was not pressed on whether the UK should pursue a \u201chard\u201d Brexit outside the single market with greater powers to restrict immigration, or \u201csoft\u201d Brexit preserving single market access but with fewer migration controls. He accused British businesses of being addicted to cheap migrant labour, claiming that for 25 years they had been \u201cmainlining immigration like drugs\u201d without caring enough about training young people from the UK.</p> <p>The appearance on Marr was the first major interview given by Johnson since he became foreign secretary in May\u2019s government, after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2016/jun/30/brexit-live-theresa-may-and-boris-johnson-set-to-announce-leadership-bids\">pulling out of the contest at the last minute when his campaign chief, Michael Gove, decided to challenge him</a>.</p> <p>The former London mayor has kept a relatively low profile since the referendum, leading to speculation that he is being kept on a tight leash by No 10.</p> <p>On Sunday, an account of the EU referendum campaign by David Cameron\u2019s former communications chief, Craig Oliver, revealed that Johnson was genuinely conflicted about whether to back leave or remain until the very last minute and accused him of being a \u201cconflicted inner\u201d. The account, in a book <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3805977/How-Theresa-torpedoed-Cameron-Boris-Johnson-said-Leave-LOSE-Explosive-new-book-No10-reveals-inside-story-Brexit.html\">serialised in the Mail on Sunday</a>, says Johnson vacillated, sending conflicting text messages to Cameron the day before he came out for Brexit.</p> <p>Oliver wrote: \u201cI ask DC what makes him so sure Boris is wobbling. He reads out some parts of the text, including the phrase \u2018depression is setting in\u2019, followed by a clear sense that he\u2019s reconsidering. Neither of us is left in any doubt.\u201d </p> <p>The following day Cameron received a final text from Johnson saying he would be backing leave \u2013 just nine minutes before he publicly announced his intentions in a chaotic press conference outside his London home.</p> <p>Oliver said Cameron later phoned him to say Johnson\u2019s final message had been clear that he did not expect to win, believing Brexit would be \u201ccrushed\u201d. \u201cHe says Boris is really a \u2018confused inner\u2019, and their previous conversations confirmed that view to him,\u201d he wrote.</p>",

How can that be unsaid or undone? \u201cThe response to that is, tell us what the problems are, and help us address them. The offer to each of them is to say: what is your criticism? Is it around presentational style, is it around a policy area you are worried about, is it around a professional relationship, or an organisational issue? What is it?\u201d He argues that Labour is actually a lot more united than it seems. \u201cPolicywise, well you have seen it in this leadership election. The most common phrase used by Owen Smith [the challenger] is, \u2018I agree with Jeremy.\u2019 Apart from Trident and Syria \u2013 and I always argued for free votes on those because I knew they were conscience issues \u2013 on virtually every other area there was consensus.\u201d</p> <p>He urges the MPs who quit the frontbench to unresign. \u201cWe get them back, hopefully. Quite a few have been contacting us.\u201d How many? \u201cI won\u2019t go into numbers, but a few. We just want to get them back to work. I think they will accept the mandate.\u201d He says that a welcome mat would even be laid out for the defeated challenger should Smith have a change of heart about returning to the shadow cabinet. \u201cOf course. He is extremely bright, he wants to get things done, he was a doing a great job and he was a great performer in the chamber.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8425f2b12b4354089e442e5d02a87ff6d1df646c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8425f2b12b4354089e442e5d02a87ff6d1df646c/0_137_4096_2458/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Owen Smith\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">McDonnell says even Owen Smith would be welcomed back into the shadow cabinet.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Robert Perry/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Many Labour MPs say that they would be more likely to return to the frontbench team if the parliamentary party were to regain the right to elect most of the shadow cabinet. \u201cThere is an open discussion going on,\u201d he responds cautiously. \u201cThere will be a wider discussion within the party at every level. But you need time to do that.\u201d He floats the suggestion of \u201ca special rules conference\u201d to introduce changes that would mean \u201cmore member involvement\u201d.</p> <p>One consequence of the leadership contest has been to swell Labour\u2019s membership to the point where it is now the largest party in western Europe. \u201cWe\u2019ve got 680,000 members now. We could be in a situation by next year where we have a million members. We have got to come to terms with how you organise that and how to make sure those people are fully involved.\u201d</p> <p>The membership surge and an accompanying increase in donations has also made the party considerably richer. But the shadow chancellor can\u2019t say by precisely how much because, according to him, the party\u2019s general secretary won\u2019t tell him. \u201cI don\u2019t know.

He denies that a revenge counter-purge of the general secretary and his staff is now planned. We ask him directly: does he want to get rid of McNicol? \u201cNo, no,\u201d he insists. \u201cHappy for him to remain.\u201d It\u2019s not the warmest of endorsements.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video element--supporting\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/sep/25/john-mcdonnell-comment-esther-mcvey-anger-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/54ty7\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2749633\"            data-video-name=\"John McDonnell says comment on Esther McVey \u2018made in anger\u2019 \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"ITV Peston on Sunday\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57e7b966e4b0f55a9f4030de\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/09/25/160925McDonnellPeston_KP-29402774_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/09/25/160925McDonnellPeston_KP-29402774.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/09/25/160925McDonnellPeston_KP-29402774_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/sep/25/john-mcdonnell-comment-esther-mcvey-anger-video\">John McDonnell says comment on Esther McVey \u2018made in anger\u2019</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>He also denies that there is a plan to punish Labour MPs who refuse to fall into line: the decapitation-by-deselection that is undoubtedly feared in the parliamentary party. \u201cWe are not in favour of mandatory reselection.

Corbyn\u2019s victory speech was a notably slicker performance than the one he delivered at his first coronation.</p> <p>McDonnell also suggests he doesn\u2019t entirely disagree with Labour MPs who complain that the leadership team has been dysfunctional. \u201cI always thought I was a political artisan and not a bad bureaucrat because that is my background,\u201d he says.

Though Theresa May has ruled out trying to cash in her poll advantage, McDonnell thinks she might change her mind. \u201cYou never trust a Tory. So it could come at any time.

In 2012, the weakened rebels agreed to begin negotiating a peace deal. At the time, leftist governments were in power across the region, giving the Farc confidence that since they were unable to take power via their armed struggle, they might achieve it through the ballot box. <br></p> <p>Before his death, former Venezuela president Hugo Ch\u00e1vez \u2013 a former army officer who attempted a failed coup before securing power in an election \u2013 declared <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/armed-revolution-in-latin-america-is-over-says-chavez-843553.html\">armed guerrilla movements to be \u201cout of place</a>\u201d, a conclusion reached many years ago by his allies in Cuba, Fidel and Ra\u00fal Castro.

But for most of its history the National Liberation Army (ELN) has played second fiddle to the country\u2019s larger and more powerful Farc.<br></p> <p>Now that the Farc have committed to lay down their weapons and shift to party politics, the ELN \u2013 founded the same year as the Farc in 1964 \u2013 becomes the oldest and largest insurgency in Latin America. </p> <p>\u201cThe ELN have lived in the shadow of the Farc,\u201d says Jerry McDermott, director of InSight Crime, a thinktank that studies insurgencies and organised crime in Latin America. \u201cNow will be the first time they will be in the limelight they have always craved,\u201d McDermott says.</p> <p>From the beginning, the ELN combined Marxist-Leninist ideology with liberation theology; some of the group\u2019s first recruits came from the church, including Camilo Torres, a popular Colombian priest who died in his first battle in 1966 and later became a cultural icon of the group. The group was nearly decimated in the 1970s as a result of a military offensive and internal fractures that led to bloody purges. </p> <p>But it recovered, and at its peak in the 1990s boasted an army of 5,000, after turning to kidnapping, extortion of oil companies and involvement in the drug trade.

But in 1980, it declared war on \u201cbourgeois democracy\u201d, burned ballot boxes and established military bases and training camps in the Andean highlands, where they won the support of poor local farmers. </p> <p>In the years that followed, there were massacres on both sides. Shining Path guerrillas set off bombs in Lima and killed dozens of individuals, including rival Marxist leaders and union bosses. By its peak in 1991, the movement controlled much of south and central Peru but came under fierce assault from the armed forces during the presidency of Alberto Fujimori, who was also blamed for massacres and human rights abuses. </p> <p>A 2003 Truth and Reconciliation Commission report estimated Shining Path was responsible for just over half the 69,280 people who were killed or went missing from 1980 to 2000 as a result of armed conflict in Peru. The security forces were blamed for about a third of the casualties and the rest were attributed to militias and other guerrilla groups, including the now defunct T\u00fapac Amaru Revolutionary Movement.</p> <p> Following the arrest of Guzm\u00e1n in 1992, Shining Path has declined and the government declared it destroyed in 2012. But the group is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/dec/08/artemio-peru-shining-path-commander\">rumoured to have made a comeback</a> in recent years. At least one faction continues to be active in cocaine production and sporadic attacks, most recently on the eve of this year\u2019s election, when eight soldiers and two civilians were killed.

In Texas, as in most states, the judge and jury on a book\u2019s fate is typically an anonymous mailroom clerk, \u201cwho often don\u2019t have high school diplomas,\u201d says Wright. \u201cThe bureaucratic system rubber stamps it from there.\u201d</p> <p> Texas is one of the few states with a comprehensive database; that committee typically acts as a court of appeals. (Prisoners wishing to appeal obviously cannot have a copy of the book to prepare their case.) While most states allow each prison to operate haphazardly, Wright says the states with databases \u2014 Arizona, Florida, Michigan, and North Carolina \u2013 \u201care the most systematic and organized in their censorship.\u201d </p> <p> The lists are generally not accessible, Wright says, and the lack of transparency means publishers or groups or people sending books don\u2019t know what\u2019s banned. </p> <p> \u201cThere is no accountability,\u201d Dillon says, adding that some inmates have complained that one clerk might ban a book that another would let through, either because the one clerk is grouchy, doesn\u2019t like the prisoner for whom it is intended, or has more conservative values. Wright says any minority viewpoint\u2014racial, ethnic, political or religious is especially likely to be shot down. </p> <p> But it goes beyond that. A collection of Shakespeare\u2019s sonnets and a collection of Leonardo DaVinci\u2019s sketches have both been banished in Texas for sexual content (the Shakespeare edition had a painting with nudity on the cover) while a book like <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Pleasures-All-Mine-Professional-Submissive/dp/0786716487\">The Pleasure\u2019s All Mine</a>, filled with descriptions of kinky sex made it through. </p> <p> Dillon and Stone both acknowledge that certain books should be banned \u2014 books about lock picking or bomb making, for example. But the paranoid approach taken is a \u201cslippery slope because everything becomes suspicious,\u201d Dillon says, so a prisoner cannot learn about American sign language because it may be used to flash signals or to read biographies of black leaders or about the inequities of our justice system because it may make them less cooperative. </p> <p> \u201cWe understand there are sometimes concerns,\u201d Stone adds, but points out that it would make more sense to take certain books away from specific prisoners (such as books with scenes of rape or pedophilia from people convicted of those crimes) than to create blanket bans. \u201cUnfortunately, the courts have not been friendly to us and support the rights of prison officials instead of the rights of prisoners to educate and rehabilitate themselves.\u201d</p> <p> Wright, who says the \u201cvery, very occasional victories\u201d come in less conservative states, is harsher in his assessment, saying the courts \u201chave abdicated their duty\u201d by letting prison officials make law based on \u201cBecause we said so.\u201d</p> <p> Slater is disheartened by the entire situation. \u201cIt\u2019s like we\u2019re living in the dark ages,\u201d Slater says. \u201cI believe strongly in the power of knowledge and enlightenment and in what books can do, especially for someone who is down and who feels a connection to a story.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>In March of 2015, after being recruited for months, Ryan Bishop was thrilled to receive an invitation to join his university\u2019s chapter of of Chi Phi, America\u2019s oldest fraternity. But a week before his induction, Chi Phi\u2019s national office notified the Ohio Wesleyan University chapter that Bishop wasn\u2019t eligible. </p> <p>Chi Phi\u2019s official rules only allowed men, and Bishop was born a woman.</p> <p>Bishop was raised in Sofia, Bulgaria. He always said his sex felt wrong, but never felt safe enough to transition in the conservative Balkan country. America offered a sort of gender asylum and so three years ago, on his first night at university, Bishop introduced himself as Ryan. </p> <p>\u201cIt was life changing,\u201d Bishop said. \u201cIt felt like the moment I arrived here I was seen as who I truly am, and could just act like myself.\u201d<br><br>Bishop jumped into campus activism and devoted his studies to zoology. Former Chi Phi president Kyle Simon, 22, said he recruited Bishop to join the fraternity because he was so impressive.</p> <p>\u201cRyan represented the best student leader that I had seen as a first year since coming to the university,\u201d Simon said. \u201cAs an international student and transgender, we would get a really amazing person, with another diverse perspective. He was everything I wanted Chi Phi to become.\u201d</p> <p>When Chi Phi rejected Bishop, Simon was shocked and ashamed. \u201cI had sold him on this idea that he could be a fraternity man, and it was a smack in the face,\u201d Simon said.</p> <p>In July, Chi Phi opened membership to transgender individuals that were \u201cmale as defined by valid legal documentation.\u201d The decision was widely publicized and celebrated, but the fine print was ignored.</p> <p>For Bishop, Chi Phi\u2019s requirement for \u201cvalid legal documentation\u201d meant that to join the fraternity, he would need to change his government issued identification and likely undergo costly and intensive sex reassignment surgery.</p> <p>\u201cNot being allowed into the fraternity was humiliating because they were saying, we see you the way you are on paper,\u201d Bishop said. \u201cNo one deserves to be excluded or discriminated against based on their gender or based on genitals.\u201d</p> <p>Chi Phi did not respond to multiple requests for comment, but representatives from Ohio Wesleyan University said the school supports Bishop. </p> <p>\u201cThe issue of transgender students participating in Greek life is important to Ohio Wesleyan on multiple levels,\u201d said Cole Hatcher, media and community relations director for Ohio Wesleyan University. \u201cWe seek to be open, inclusive, and supportive of the LGBTIQ community. The university believes Ryan and all students have the right to participate fully in every aspect of campus life. Therefore, we support Ryan and his effort to participate in Greek life based on his self-identity and not his birth certificate.\u201d</p> <p>Bishop\u2019s experience comes when many institutions defined by gender binaries \u2013 American schools, the US military, and even the International Olympic Committee \u2013 are adopting transgender-inclusive policies. This May, the US Department of Education informed American schools in a <a href=\"http://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/index.html\">Dear Colleague letter</a> that it is illegal to discriminate against students based on their gender identity. </p> <p>But Title IX, the US law prohibiting sex discrimination in educational programs and activities, does not apply to fraternities and sororities. And because gender identity is not a protected class like race, religion, or sexual orientation, individual Greek organizations can decide whether to allow transgender members in, as well as whether membership will be based on gender identity or genitalia. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1309604a7a0ce3f24dc88a7b8e8dff5273ab1a86\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1309604a7a0ce3f24dc88a7b8e8dff5273ab1a86/0_54_960_576/500.jpg\" alt=\"Alpha Sigma Alpha Bid Day in 2016.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alpha Sigma Alpha Bid Day in 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Leigh Angel</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Greek houses have been central to American university life for more than 200 years. Infamous for raging parties, members tout familial bonds and swear lifelong loyalty. In the US, more than 200,000 students rush Greek houses every year, and some of those individuals identify as transgender.</p> <p>Lawyers say excluding transgender students because of their gender identity could put fraternities at risk of discrimination complaints and threaten their staying power. </p> <p>Currently the policies vary by organization, but several prominent Greek houses have adopted transgender inclusive policies in the last year. The sorority Gamma Rho Lambda is open to all gender identities, and recently opened a new chapter at the University of Texas. The fraternities Sigma Phi Epsilon, Delta Upsilon, Delta Tau Delta, and the sorority Delta Gamma, have also recently changed their bylaws to allow for anyone who \u201cidentifies as\u201d male or female, and don\u2019t require any paperwork.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"24d8c304c9d5ba329a7a43c6a9d8ca45b88aa943\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/24d8c304c9d5ba329a7a43c6a9d8ca45b88aa943/0_65_960_576/500.jpg\" alt=\"Leigh Angel (centre) with her sisters.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Leigh Angel (center) with her sisters.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Leigh Angel</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Leigh Angel, 19, a second-year transgender woman at Adrian College in Michigan, never thought she would be allowed to join a sorority. But then friends from Alpha Sigma Alpha sorority invited her to a party and three weeks later, Angel was asked to join.</p> <p>\u201cIt felt really really amazing to know that I had a home,\u201d she said. \u201cEvery single member of the sorority was so open and accepting, and I didn\u2019t imagine every single person in such a large group to be that way.\u201d</p> <p>Angel thinks the process of sorority rush can be intimidating and discourage transgender women from rushing. Unlike fraternity rush, which is usually a few nights of spending time with brothers at one house, the process is more intensive for women, who usually attend a series of parties at many different sororities. At the end of each party, the sorority sisters rank the participants by who they liked the most, and the participants are invited back to the next round of events accordingly.<br></p> <p>\u201cI think many of us feel that if we were to try to rush a sorority we would be rejected almost instantly, and I think that plays a big part of why we don\u2019t see many [transgender women],\u201d Angel said. \u201cThe beauty of what happened to me was that they came to me.\u201d </p> <p>Alpha Sigma Alpha did not respond to requests to clarify their position on transgender membership, and didn\u2019t say if transgender women are welcome to join other chapters of the sorority. </p> <p>Generally, gay friendly organizations are more welcoming to transgender members. Sean Finn, 20, a transgender man at the University of Iowa was welcomed into Delta Lambda Phi, which was founded in 1986 \u201cfor gay men by gay men\u201d. By the time Finn joined, he had begun to transition medically through surgery and hormone therapy, although it wouldn\u2019t have been necessary for membership.</p> <p>Ben Ross, 21, president of Delta Lambda Phi at the University of Iowa, said there was never any question if Finn could join. \u201cWe have a defined set of values and we try to use those values as a benchmark for deciding whether or not someone is the right fit for our organization,\u201d Ross said. \u201cChecking with my national office, and what was written down in our national policy, it was clear to me after reading it that Sean was certainly welcome.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cc92c9a51eed88b6cd0df502338e86f13ac71cc3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cc92c9a51eed88b6cd0df502338e86f13ac71cc3/0_5_1343_806/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sean Finn with fraternity friends.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sean Finn with fraternity friends.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Sean Finn</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Although Delta Lambda Phi is committed to accepting transgender men into the fraternity, inviting cis-gendered women, or women who identify with the sex assigned at birth, is still inconceivable. According to Ross, his chapter feels masculinity is deeply rooted in Delta Lambda Phi\u2019s values, and female members would change the club\u2019s basic nature. </p> <p>\u201cI struggle with the idea of a cis-gender female in this organization, and I don\u2019t have a very good reason,\u201d Ross said. \u201cBut the justification I can provide for now, is that a similar but not the same experience is open for female-identified individuals through sororities.\u201d</p> <p>Stevie Van Tran, a lawyer and consultant who works on the intersection of Title IX and transgender issues, said the debate over which genders can join which Greek houses could easily end up before the courts.</p> <p>\u201cThis may be the issue that blows open the entire door,\u201d Van Tran said.</p> <p>According to the first amendment of the US constitution, private organizations have the right to define membership on their own terms. But on a university campus, it is very hard to for an organization like a fraternity to be considered completely private. Which means if Greek houses decide they don\u2019t want to let in transgender members, and are willing to fight in court to keep these students out, there is a good chance they\u2019d lose.</p> <p>\u201cA court is going to say: \u2018You say you are a private organization dedicated to building character among men, but you party a lot and you have a lot of activities with the public, so how can you call a 500-member chapter a private organization?\u2019 Then it comes crashing down,\u201d Van Tran explained.</p> <p>It is possible, in the future, all Greek houses will have to become co-ed. In 1990, the supreme court of New Jersey decided that Princeton\u2019s elite fraternity-like eating clubs, Ivy Club and Tiger Inn, had so much contact with the public that they did not qualify as private organizations, and had to allow women to join. Now, all of Princeton\u2019s eating clubs are coed.</p> <p>Harvard is already pushing their fraternities, sororities and finals clubs to drop gender distinctions. In May of this year, Harvard\u2019s president, Drew Gilpin Faust, said that any student joining an unrecognized single-gender club couldn\u2019t hold leadership positions in campus organizations, athletic teams, and wouldn\u2019t receive recommendations from the school for scholarships or other academic opportunities.</p> <p>For now, Ryan Bishop has given up on joining Chi Phi. He considered a lawsuit against the fraternity, but decided it would be expensive and complicated as an international student to pursue a case. Plus, he feels there has been enough social fall out. </p> <p>\u201cI definitely feel like I have lost friends,\u201d he said. \u201cBeing a visible minority on campus the way that I am it is not at all easy, but I try to fall back on the people that support me.\u201d<br></p> <p>Bishop said he longer feels welcome at Chi Phi, but has found a place for himself on campus and will keep pushing for transgender rights.</p> <p>\u201cCollege is a place to grow and to learn,\u201d Bishop said. \u201cI think it is really important at a place like this to say, listen, \u2018Here\u2019s how things are, it is time to be educated about this,\u2019 and show queer and trans people you are understood, you are accepted, you belong here, and we stand behind you.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>The German writer Norman Ohler lives on the top floor of a 19th-century apartment building on the south bank of the river Spree in Kreuzberg, Berlin. Visiting him there is a vertiginous experience. For one thing, he works \u2013 and likes to entertain visitors \u2013 in what he calls his \u201cwriting tower\u201d, a flimsy-seeming, glass-walled turret perched right on the very edge of the roof. (Look down, if you dare, and you will see his little boat moored far below.) For another, there is the fact that from this vantage point it is possible to discern two Berlins, one thrusting and breezy, the other spectral and grey. To our left, busy with traffic, is the Oberbaum Bridge, where there was once a cold war checkpoint, and beyond it the longest remaining section of the Berlin Wall, its doleful length rudely interrupted by the block of luxury flats that went up in 2013. As for the large building immediately opposite, these days it\u2019s the home of Universal Music. Not so very long ago, however, it was the GDR\u2019s egg storage facility.</p> <p>Does all this press on Ohler as he sits at his desk, the light bouncing off the screen of his laptop? Is it ghostly sometimes? \u201cYes, it is strange,\u201d he says, smiling at my giddiness. But then he has long believed in a certain kind of time travel. \u201cI remember the 90s. The wall had just come down, and I was experimenting with party drugs like ecstasy and LSD. The techno scene had started up, and there were all these empty buildings in the east where the youth [from east and west] would meet for the first time. They were hardcore, some of those guys from the east \u2013 they didn\u2019t understand foreigners at all \u2013 and the ecstasy helped them to lose some of their hatred and suspicion. Sometimes, then, you could step into a room, and you could just <em>see</em> the past. Of course, it\u2019s not like that now. I don\u2019t take drugs any more. But I can remember it, and maybe that was why I was able to write this book.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"f707d85c4e11113d55b5d118f5c964700abee29d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f707d85c4e11113d55b5d118f5c964700abee29d/307_1677_3991_4989/800.jpg\" alt=\"Norman Ohler in Berlin\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Norman Ohler photographed in Berlin last week.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: MalteJaeger/laif</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The book in question is <em>The Total Rush</em> \u2013 or, to use its superior English title, <em>Blitzed</em> \u2013 which reveals the astonishing and hitherto largely untold story of the Third Reich\u2019s relationship with drugs, including cocaine, heroin, morphine and, above all, methamphetamines (aka crystal meth), and of their effect not only on Hitler\u2019s final days \u2013 the F\u00fchrer, by Ohler\u2019s account, was an absolute junkie with ruined veins by the time he retreated to the last of his bunkers \u2013 but on the Wehrmacht\u2019s successful invasion of France in 1940. Published in Germany last year, where it became a bestseller, it has since been translated into 18 languages, a fact that delights Ohler, but also amazes him.</p> <p>It\u2019s not only that he is \u2013 as <em>Der Spiegel</em> helpfully pointed out \u2013 a non-historian (the author of three novels and the co-writer of the Wim Wenders film <em>Palermo Shooting</em>, this is his first work of nonfiction). It\u2019s that there was anything new to be said at all. Arrange all the books that have been written about the Nazis end to end and they\u2019d be longer than the Spree.</p> <p>\u201cI guess drugs weren\u2019t a priority for the historians,\u201d he says. \u201cA crazy guy like me had to come along.\u201d Still, crazy or not, he has done a remarkable job. If <em>Blitzed</em> is gripping, it is also convincing. Ian Kershaw, the British historian who is probably the world\u2019s leading authority on Hitler and Nazi Germany, has described it as \u201ca serious piece of scholarship\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The invasion of France was made possible by the drugs. Rommel and all those tank commanders were high</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Unlikely as it sounds, it was Ohler\u2019s friend, the Berlin DJ Alexander Kramer, who first put him on to the idea. \u201cHe\u2019s like a medium for that time,\u201d says Ohler. \u201cHe has this huge library, and he knows all the music from the 20s. One night he said to me: \u2018Do you know the massive role drugs played in National Socialism?\u2019 I told him that I didn\u2019t, but that it sounded true \u2013 and I knew immediately it would be the subject of my next book.\u201d</p> <p>His plan was to write a novel, but with his first visit to the archives that changed completely. There he found the papers of Dr Theodor Morell, Hitler\u2019s personal physician, previously only a minor character in most studies of the F\u00fchrer. \u201cI knew then that this was already better than fiction.\u201d In the months that followed, supported by the late, great German historian of the Third Reich <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/12/hans-mommsen\">Hans Mommsen</a>, Ohler travelled from archive to archive, carefully gathering his material \u2013 and how much of it there was! He didn\u2019t use half of what he found. \u201cLook at this,\u201d he says, jumping up. When he returns, in his hand is a copy of a letter from Martin Bormann, Hitler\u2019s private secretary, in which he suggests that the \u201cmedication\u201d Morell is giving the F\u00fchrer needs to be regulated for the sake of his increasingly wobbly health.</p> <p>The story Ohler tells begins in the days of the Weimar Republic, when Germany\u2019s pharmaceutical industry was thriving \u2013 the country was a leading exporter both of opiates, such as morphine, and of cocaine \u2013 and drugs were available on every street corner. It was during this period that Hitler\u2019s inner circle established an image of him as an unassailable figure who was willing to work tirelessly on behalf of his country, and who would permit no toxins \u2013 not even coffee \u2013 to enter his body.</p> <p>\u201cHe is all genius and body,\u201d reported one of his allies in 1930. \u201cAnd he mortifies that body in a way that would shock people like us! He doesn\u2019t drink, he practically only eats vegetables, and he doesn\u2019t touch women.\u201d No wonder that when the Nazis seized power in 1933, \u201cseductive poisons\u201d were immediately outlawed. In the years that followed, drug users would be deemed \u201ccriminally insane\u201d; some would be killed by the state using a lethal injection; others would be sent to concentration camps. Drug use also began to be associated with Jews. The Nazi party\u2019s office of racial purity claimed that the Jewish character was essentially drug-dependent. Both needed to be eradicated from Germany.</p> <p>Some drugs, however, had their uses, particularly in a society hell bent on keeping up with the energetic Hitler (\u201cGermany awake!\u201d the Nazis ordered, and the nation had no choice but to snap to attention). A substance that could \u201cintegrate shirkers, malingerers, defeatists and whiners\u201d into the labour market might even be sanctioned. At a company called Temmler in Berlin, Dr Fritz Hauschild, its head chemist, inspired by the successful use of the American amphetamine <a href=\"http://www.liquisearch.com/doping_in_sport/benzedrine\">Benzedrine at the 1936 Olympic Games</a>, began trying to develop his own wonder drug \u2013 and a year later, he patented the first German methyl-amphetamine. Pervitin, as it was known, quickly became a sensation, used as a confidence booster and performance enhancer by everyone from secretaries to actors to train drivers (initially, it could be bought without prescription). It even made its way into confectionery. \u201cHildebrand chocolates are always a delight,\u201d went the slogan. Women were recommended to eat two or three, after which they would be able to get through their housework in no time at all \u2013 with the added bonus that they would also lose weight, given the deleterious effect Pervitin had on the appetite. Ohler describes it as National Socialism in pill form.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6e03fc24ad9b14754ce2e8be9ba554fb046b8af3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6e03fc24ad9b14754ce2e8be9ba554fb046b8af3/3_0_1012_607/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Workers at the Temmler factory in Berlin\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Workers at the Temmler factory in Berlin produced 35m tablets of Pervitin for the German army and Luftwaffe in 1940.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Temmler Pharma GmbH &amp; Co KG, Marburg</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Naturally, it wasn\u2019t long before soldiers were relying on it too. In <em>Blitzed</em>, Ohler reproduces a letter sent in 1939 by Heinrich B\u00f6ll, the future Nobel laureate, from the frontline to his parents back at home, in which he begs them for Pervitin, the only way he knew to fight the great enemy \u2013 sleep. In Berlin, it was the job of Dr Otto Ranke, the director of the Institute for General and Defence Physiology, to protect the Wehrmacht\u2019s \u201canimated machines\u201d \u2013 ie its soldiers \u2013 from wear, and after conducting some tests he concluded that Pervitin was indeed excellent medicine for exhausted soldiers. Not only did it make sleep unnecessary (Ranke, who would himself become addicted to the drug, observed that he could work for 50 hours on Pervitin without feeling fatigued), it also switched off inhibitions, making fighting easier, or at any rate less terrifying.</p> <p>In 1940, as plans were made to invade France through the Ardennes mountains, a \u201cstimulant decree\u201d was sent out to army doctors, recommending that soldiers take one tablet per day, two at night in short sequence, and another one or two tablets after two or three hours if necessary. The Wehrmacht ordered 35m tablets for the army and Luftwaffe, and the Temmler factory increased production. The likes of B\u00f6ll, it\u2019s fair to say, wouldn\u2019t need to ask their parents for Pervitin again.</p> <p>Was Blitzkrieg, then, largely the result of the Wehrmacht\u2019s reliance on crystal meth? How far is Ohler willing to go with this? He smiles. \u201cWell, Mommsen always told me not to be mono-causal. But the invasion of France was made possible by the drugs. No drugs, no invasion. When Hitler heard about the plan to invade through Ardennes, he loved it [the allies were massed in northern Belgium]. But the high command said: it\u2019s not possible, at night we have to rest, and they [the allies] will retreat and we will be stuck in the mountains. But then the stimulant decree was released, and that enabled them to stay awake for three days and three nights. Rommel [who then led one of the panzer divisions] and all those tank commanders were high \u2013 and without the tanks, they certainly wouldn\u2019t have won.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"9ac735dbed31252301672e421a0e07622084bfce\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9ac735dbed31252301672e421a0e07622084bfce/0_98_1500_900/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A tube of Pervitin\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pervitin: Nazi Germany\u2019s drug of choice.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: handout/Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Thereafter, drugs were regarded as an effective weapon by high command, one that could be deployed against the greatest odds. In 1944-45, for instance, when it was increasingly clear that victory against the allies was all but impossible, the German navy developed a range of one-man U-boats; the fantastical idea was that these pint-sized submarines would make their way up the Thames estuary. But since they could only be used if the lone marines piloting them could stay awake for days at a time, Dr Gerhard Orzechowski, the head pharmacologist of the naval supreme command on the Baltic, had no choice but to begin working on the development of a new super-medication \u2013 a cocaine chewing gum that would be the hardest drug German soldiers had ever taken. It was tested at the Sachsenhausen concentration camp, on a track used to trial new shoe soles for German factories; prisoners were required to walk \u2013 and walk \u2013 until they dropped.</p> <p>\u201cIt was crazy, horrifying,\u201d says Ohler, quietly. \u201cEven Mommsen was shocked by this. He had never heard about it before.\u201d The young marines, strapped in their metal boxes, unable to move at all and cut off from the outside world, suffered psychotic episodes as the drugs took hold, and frequently got lost, at which point the fact that they could stay awake for up to seven days became irrelevant. \u201cIt was unreal,\u201d says Ohler. \u201cThis wasn\u2019t reality. But if you\u2019re fighting an enemy bigger than yourself, you have no choice. You must, somehow, exceed your own strength. That\u2019s why terrorists use suicide bombers. It\u2019s an unfair weapon. If you\u2019re going to send a bomb into a crowd of civilians, of course you\u2019re going to have a success.\u201d</p> <p>Meanwhile, in Berlin, Hitler was experiencing his own unreality, with his only ally in the world his podgy, insecure personal physician, Dr Morell. In the late 20s, Morell had grown a thriving private practice in Berlin, his reputation built on the modish vitamin injections he liked to give his patients. He met Hitler after he treated Heinrich Hoffman, the official Reich photographer, and sensing an opportunity quickly ingratiated himself with the F\u00fchrer, who had long suffered from severe intestinal pains. Morell prescribed Mutaflor, a preparation based on bacteria, and when his patient\u2019s condition \u2013 Patient A, as Hitler was thereafter known \u2013 began to improve, their codependent relationship began. Both were isolated. Hitler increasingly trusted no one but his doctor, while Morell relied solely on the F\u00fchrer for his position.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Everyone describes the bad health of Hitler in those final days. To me, it's pretty clear that it was partly withdrawal</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>When Hitler fell seriously ill in 1941, however, the vitamin injections that Morell had counted on no longer had any effect \u2013 and so he began to ramp things up. First, there were injections of animal hormones for this most notorious of vegetarians, and then a whole series of ever stronger medications until, at last, he began giving him a \u201cwonder drug\u201d called Eukodal, a designer opiate and close cousin of heroin whose chief characteristic was its potential to induce a euphoric state in the patient (today it is known as oxycodone). It wasn\u2019t long before Hitler was receiving injections of Eukodal several times a day. Eventually he would combine it with twice daily doses of the high grade cocaine he had originally been prescribed for a problem with his ears, following an explosion in the Wolf\u2019s Lair, his bunker on the eastern front.</p> <p>Did Morell deliberately turn Hitler into an addict? Or was he simply powerless to resist the F\u00fchrer\u2019s addictive personality? \u201cI don\u2019t think it was deliberate,\u201d says Ohler. \u201cBut Hitler trusted him. When those around him tried to remove Morell in the fall of 1944, Hitler stood up for him \u2013 though by then, he knew that if he was to go, he [Hitler] would be finished. They got along very well. Morell loved to give injections, and Hitler liked to have them. He didn\u2019t like pills because of his weak stomach and he wanted a quick effect. He was time-pressed; he thought he was going to die young.\u201d When did Hitler realise he was an addict? \u201cQuite late. Someone quotes him as saying to Morell: you\u2019ve been giving me opiates all the time. But mostly, they talked about it in oblique terms. Hitler didn\u2019t like to refer to the Eukodal. Maybe he was trying to block it off from his mind. And like any dealer, Morell was never going to say: yeah, you\u2019re addicted, and I have something to feed that for you.\u201d So he talked in terms of health rather than addiction? \u201cYes, exactly.\u201d</p> <p>The effect of the drugs could appear to onlookers to be little short of miraculous. One minute the F\u00fchrer was so frail he could barely stand up. The next, he would be ranting unstoppably at Mussolini. Ah, yes: Mussolini. In Italy, <em>Blitzed</em> will come with an extra chapter. \u201cI found out that Mussolini \u2013 patient D, for Il Duce \u2013 was another of Morell\u2019s patients. After the Germans installed him as the puppet leader of the Republic of Italy in 1943, they ordered him to be put under the eyes of the doctor.\u201d Again, Ohler springs up. Again, he returns with a document in his hand. \u201cThere\u2019s not enough material to say he was an addict. But he was being given the same drugs as Hitler. Every week there was a doctorly report.\u201d He runs his finger along the typewritten lines, translating for me as he goes. \u201cHe has improved, he is playing tennis again, the swelling of his liver is normal\u2026 It\u2019s like he\u2019s a racehorse.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1e10fa2d77365ddab48729b2a1fb92917f7777aa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1e10fa2d77365ddab48729b2a1fb92917f7777aa/0_111_1181_1476/800.jpg\" alt=\"An unwell-looking Adolf Hitler in July 1944.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An unwell-looking Adolf Hitler in July 1944.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ullsteinbild/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For Hitler, though, a crisis was coming. When the factories where Pervitin and Eukodal were made were bombed by the allies, supplies of his favourite drugs began to run out, and by February 1945 he was suffering withdrawal. Bowed and drooling and stabbing at his skin with a pair of golden tweezers, he cut a pitiful sight. \u201cEveryone describes the bad health of Hitler in those final days [in the F\u00fchrerbunker in Berlin],\u201d says Ohler. \u201cBut there\u2019s no clear explanation for it. It has been suggested that he was suffering from Parkinson\u2019s disease. To me, though, it\u2019s pretty clear that it was partly withdrawal.\u201d He grins. \u201cYeah, it must have been pretty awful. He\u2019s losing a world war, and he\u2019s coming off drugs.\u201d</p> <p>Two months later, Hitler and his new wife, Eva Braun (like Leni Riefenstahl, another of Morell\u2019s patients), killed themselves, as the world knows. What happened to Morell? We know he survived, but did he get away unscathed?</p> <p>\u201cI think a lot of Nazis did get away with it,\u201d says Ohler. \u201cBut not him. He wasn\u2019t able to shed his skin, make a new career, get rich on his memoirs \u2013 even though he could have said, truly, that he hadn\u2019t committed any war crimes. He lost his mind. He disintegrated. He\u2019s a tragic figure. He wasn\u2019t evil. He was only an opportunist.\u201d</p> <p>In 1947, the Americans, having tried and failed to extract useful information from him, deposited Morell in Munich. There he was picked up by a half-Jewish Red Cross nurse who took pity on this dishevelled, shoeless figure. She delivered him to the hospital in Tegernsee, where he died a year later.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Nazi Germany was a place of complete chaos. Meth kept people in the system without their having to think about it</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><em>Blitzed</em> looks set to reframe the way certain aspects of the Third Reich will be viewed in the future. But Ohler\u2019s thesis doesn\u2019t, of course, make National Socialism any more fathomable, and for him, perhaps, there is an element of disappointment in this, for he has been seeking to understand it ever since he was a boy (the son of a judge, he grew up close to the border with France). \u201cIt was the whole reason why I wanted to write,\u201d he says. \u201cI thought with writing that you could counter propaganda.\u201d</p> <p>His maternal grandfather worked as a railway engineer during the war, the head of a small station in occupied Bohemia. \u201cOne day at school we watched a film of the liberation of a concentration camp, and it was so shocking to me. That same day, I asked him about the trains going to the camps. He told me that he saw one in the winter coming from the west, and that he said to himself: these are Russian POWs. But since it came from the west, and he heard children, and it was a cattle train, he kind of realised something weird was happening.</p> <p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t much older than 10, and I was trying to understand: what kind of person is this, my grandfather? Because he continued being a railway engineer. He didn\u2019t join the resistance. He said the SS was guarding the train, and he was afraid, and so he just went back into his little office to continue with his drawings. He always said Hitler wasn\u2019t so bad. In the 80s, you used to hear that a lot: that it was all exaggerated, that Hitler didn\u2019t know about the bad things, that he created order.\u201d</p> <p>He pauses. \u201cYou think it [nazism] was orderly. But it was complete chaos. I suppose working on <em>Blitzed</em> has helped me understand that at least. Meth kept people in the system without their having to think about it.\u201d His hope is that his book will be read by a younger generation of Germans who would rather look to the future than dwell on the past. Is the right rising again? Is that why he wants them to read it? \u201cIt is quite a dangerous time. I hate these <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/22/germany-braces-for-rise-in-anti-immigrant-attacks\">attacks on foreigners</a>, but then our governments do it, too, in Iraq and places. Our democracies haven\u2019t done a very good job in this globalised world.\u201d That said, he doesn\u2019t think the new party of the right, Alternative for Germany, may be the threat it appears (in elections earlier this month, it <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/04/mecklenburg-vorpommern-german-anti-immigrant-party-strong-regional-election-exit-polls-merkel\">outperformed Angela Merkel\u2019s Christian Democrats</a>). \u201cThe right wing always had so little purchase here [after the war] because of our history,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen I was young, you would never even see a German flag. The first time I did was in 1990, when Germany won the World Cup. So perhaps this is just a correction.\u201d</p> <p>Before I head to the airport, Ohler agrees to take me to see what remains of the Temmler factory \u2013 which last time he looked still stood in Berlin-Johannisthal, a part of the city that used to be in the east \u2013 and so it is that we set off on a bright blue day (in the movies, the east seems always to be grey and cold) in search of what remains of Dr Hauschild\u2019s white-tiled laboratory. Twenty minutes later, we pull up in a residential street, all window boxes and net curtains, as quiet as the grave. \u201cOh, my God,\u201d he says, unfolding his long, thin legs from the car. \u201cWow. It\u2019s completely gone.\u201d</p> <p>For a few moments, we peer wonderingly through a chain link fence at the barren expanse of dust and concrete, and the neat white and red houses beyond it. But there\u2019s nothing to be done: try as I might, I can\u2019t superimpose the eery monochrome photographs I\u2019ve seen of the factory in <em>Blitzed</em> on to this Technicolor suburban scene. What was almost tangible to me on Ohler\u2019s roof, only half an hour ago, now takes on the unreal quality of a dream \u2013 or, perhaps, just a very bad trip.</p> <p><em>Blitzed is published by Penguin on 6 October (\u00a320). </em><a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/blitzed-434323.html\"><em>Click here</em></a><em> to order a copy for \u00a316.40 go to bookshop.theguardian.com or call 0330 333 6846</em></p>",
  "<p>Born in London in 1970, screenwriter, producer and author Goldman began her writing career aged 16 when she left school and became a journalist, initially working as a showbiz reporter for the <em>Daily Star</em>.

Under <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/11/theresa-may-the-vicars-daughter-poised-to-pull-the-tories-and-the-country-from-the-abyss\">Theresa May</a>, public spending is all about restraint \u2013 that is, the state\u2019s ability to restrain people. So it\u2019s security personnel they\u2019re recruiting, according to reports last week, with MI6 looking to hire nearly 1,000 new spies over the next four years, increasing its payroll by almost 40%. This is part of a widely circulated <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/21/mi6-recruit-digital-internet-social-media\">government plan</a> to increase the staff of all three covert security agencies (MI5, MI6 and GCHQ) by a total of about 1,900.</p> <p>This all has a very different vibe from the cold war when Britain\u2019s secret services were still secret. Or officially secret anyway, which is not quite the same thing. But that\u2019s no longer politically viable. In this era of austerity, the public would be more offended by the notion that thousands of government employees were doing nothing than that they were, say, invading the privacy of millions, testing the limits of international law and abetting our allies in systematically committing war crimes. \u201cI don\u2019t mind if they\u2019re organising rendition flights, as long as they\u2019re not just sitting on their arses!\u201d</p> <p>Since 1986, when the existence of a secret intelligence service was first grudgingly acknowledged, all three institutions have been flirting with the limelight. As the Soviet Union collapsed, they all shyly took a bow and, at some point between the publications of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fromthearchive/story/0,12269,1326319,00.html\"><em>Spycatcher</em></a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2001/sep/16/biography.features\">Stella Rimington</a>\u2019s autobiography, possibly when the location manager for a Bond film first rang up to inquire about filming outside MI6, they abandoned the shadows for ever.</p> <p>In some ways, this process was quite fun \u2013 almost like a revelation that wizards or dragons really existed. \u201cSo there <em>are</em> spies, after all! And they do hang out in huge central London buildings, trying to steal secrets from each other. How magical!\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b6e6dadfab1e3fd5d61653197c87116a7010ddcf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b6e6dadfab1e3fd5d61653197c87116a7010ddcf/0_0_1884_2665/707.jpg\" alt=\"Illustration by David Foldvari.\" width=\"707\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Illustration by David Foldvari.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: David Foldvari</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But there\u2019s something rum about this openness. To start with, it\u2019s not meaningful openness. We know who the heads of these organisations are \u2013 we know, for example, that MI6\u2019s current \u201cC\u201d is really called <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/mar/31/mi6-technology-arms-race-terrorists-criminals\">Alex Younger</a>, thus reducing the code name to the same trivial ceremonial level as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2002/jun/14/uk.media\">Black Rod</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2010/sep/01/the-stig-identity-high-court\">the Stig</a>. But we don\u2019t know what they\u2019re actually doing.</p> <p>The openness about their existence and leadership, but not about the activities of their thousands of staff, is rather rubbing the public\u2019s nose in the fact that there are things we are forbidden to know, and forbidden to know about people whose salaries we pay. In contrast, the previous policy of keeping the organisations as well as their activities secret shows a certain delicacy, even a fitting shame that such a recourse should be necessary in an ostensibly free country.</p> <p>This shame is understandable in the context of the cold war, when the Soviet bloc countries over which the west, with considerable justification, asserted its moral superiority, kept so much secret from their own peoples. In the free world, secrecy smacked of tyranny. It alarmed people so, ironically, the scale of it was best kept under wraps.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/21/mi6-recruit-digital-internet-social-media\">MI6 to recruit hundreds more staff in response to digital technology</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Nowadays, however, our security services <em>want</em> us to be alarmed. They want it because it will make us feel we need them, and this is the bigger problem with the current openness. The Soviet Union gave spies an indisputable raison d\u2019\u00eatre. Since its fall, they\u2019ve felt the need to justify their existence. Obviously, before you can justify your existence, you have to admit it \u2013 but that was just the first step. The government proudly letting it be known, at a time of considerable national austerity, that thousands more security officers are to be employed shows how successful that self-justification has been.</p> <p>The language of it is familiar. We hear of \u201csecurity threats\u201d, \u201cfoiled attacks\u201d, of the prime minister \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/jul/29/theresa-may-cobra-meeting-cameron-end-to-calais-crisis\">chairing an emergency Cobra meeting</a>\u201d. At airports we see policemen with guns, while seemingly random prohibitions from our hand luggage are clues from which we attempt to work out the nature of the latest maniacal assault on our way of life. Maybe this time it was something with liquids <em>and</em> shoes? A belt shampoo bomb? A mace made out of plastic cutlery embedded in a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/sep/01/frederick-forsyth-i-was-an-mi6-agent\">Frederick Forsyth</a> novel?</p> <p>I\u2019m not saying this fear of terrorism is unjustified, and I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s justified. I\u2019m saying we don\u2019t know, and that it\u2019s unwise to leave unquestioned the estimation of the problem provided by the people we\u2019re paying to solve it.</p> <p>The widely reported terrorist threat, the stories of \u201cnear misses\u201d and \u201cheightened terror alerts\u201d, and the announcement of more investment to \u201ckeep us safe\u201d create, from the security services\u2019 point of view, a virtuous circle of increasing funding. Modern espionage is about what they\u2019re seen to do, when it used to be the opposite. It\u2019s become my sort of job after all.</p>",
  "<p>It\u2019s early September, the Colombian football team has just scored against bitter rivals Brazil, and the crowd gathered around a tiny TV screen rises and whoops, as it does in bars all over the country. Only this wooden hut is not exactly a bar; it is the recreation area for Camp Diamante, deep&#xa0;within the Colombian interior, a strategic nerve centre for the world\u2019s longest-running guerrilla insurgency.</p> <p>On neat rows of chairs, some girls sit on their boyfriends\u2019 laps; elsewhere it is a crowd of mainly young men and women sitting alongside each other \u2013 almost all in military fatigues. These are fighters from the Farc (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia, or the&#xa0;Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia). They are out for the evening, some distance away from their beds of bamboo cane and palm leaves, dug deep in the jungle. Until recently they were under ferocious bombardment by the Colombian air force.</p> <p>Now, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/23/colombia-farc-rebel-ceasefire-agreement-havana\" title=\"\">a historic peace deal</a> is being forged with the Colombian government, ending the 52-year conflict between the Farc and the state; the evening is relaxed and playful. It is as unlike a guerrilla camp as is possible to imagine.</p> <p>This week, guerrillas from all over the country converged on this remote encampment to attend Farc\u2019s historic 10th congress and to ratify a&#xa0;peace agreement that ends the conflict. In doing&#xa0;so, they will also vote for their own dissolution as an armed organisation. The future, they say, is to turn the Farc into a political, not military, force.</p> <p>Tomorrow, 26 September, in the Caribbean city of Cartagena, before diplomats from around the world, Colombia\u2019s president, Juan Manuel Santos, and the Farc\u2019s supreme commander, Rodrigo Londo\u00f1o Echeverri (known by his nom-de-guerre Timochenko), will add their signatures to the peace treaty negotiated over four years in Havana, Cuba. Then the last stage in this tortuous process comes on 2 October, when Colombia votes in a plebiscite on whether to accept or reject the deal.</p> <p>If Brexit was momentous for Europe, then Sunday\u2019s vote will be Latin America\u2019s most important in decades. A Yes would end the world\u2019s longest-running war, one that has killed 220,000 people. The figure rises to 800,000 if you include the victims of narco cartels \u2013 indelibly linked to the conflict that cursed Colombia and caused the internal displacement of six million people. A No vote might plunge Colombia back into the violence that has scarred it for centuries.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The paramilitaries have already started killing people. Peace depends on the government too.

But in the near distance an incredible structure is&#xa0;being built. In a race against time to be ready for&#xa0;the 10th congress, cabanas, conference halls, and sleeping quarters for journalists are being built. The site is abuzz night and day with activity, trucks crisscrossing it with building materials, bedding and audiovisual equipment, while fighters move purposefully from construction site to construction site.</p> <p>It\u2019s like a set from the film <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2007/jun/24/dvdreviews\" title=\"\"><em>Fitzcarraldo</em></a>, this large space cleared in the middle of the jungle to make way for the congress\u2019s huge structure of bamboo cane and timber. From everywhere comes the sound of hammering, drilling, cement-mixing in wheelbarrows. Guerrillas work two shifts, one group on site from 6am to 6pm, to be replaced by another, who take the night shift.</p> <p>The young fighters \u2013 disappointed at a narrow 2-1 loss to Brazil \u2013 leave the bar and wander back to their bivouacs under palm trees, where guns now hang from hooks alongside clothes, water bottles, combs, toothbrushes and the small number of personal items they dot around their simple sleeping places.</p> <p>If Colombia endorses the peace process, those guns will soon be handed over to the UN as part of the agreement. If, on the other hand, Colombia rejects the deal, the future for this country is less certain, although the Farc has said that there will be no return to war, irrespective of the vote.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"2a622a7645c2cfc04ed4702644289a708f71fff1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2a622a7645c2cfc04ed4702644289a708f71fff1/0_0_3024_4032/750.jpg\" alt=\"Farc fighter Duan\" width=\"750\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Farc fighter Duan, who joined the group at age 19. \u2018We are ready to return to normal life.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Mulholland</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Down the track from the main camp walks the lone figure of Duan, like many of these fighters drawn from a local indigenous tribe. He smiles broadly beneath the rim of his wide hat. \u201cI joined the Farc when I was 19,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd now I\u2019d like to study, preferably go back to working the land in Tolima. That\u2019s what God intended for me to do, but we were driven from our land by criminals, and had no option but to fight. But no one likes war. We have fought for so long, for our rights and for the poor, but we have families, and we are ready to return to normal life, still keeping a role within the organisation.\u201d</p> <p>The vote is no foregone conclusion. A former president with significant support, \u00c1lvaro Uribe, vehemently opposes it. Many fear too that the Farc, with their communist origins, are a danger to the economic stability of the country. President Santos says: \u201cIf No wins, we will return to what we had at the beginning of this government, six years ago. We return to armed conflict. That would be a catastrophe for the country.\u201d</p> <p>To try to understand South America\u2019s most brutal and complex cycle of violence, the <em>Observer</em> has, during the past year, gone deep inside this last Marxist guerrilla movement. We have travelled into the jungle, to this redoubt in the Farc\u2019s heartland, and also to Havana, where we conducted interviews of unprecedented depth and detail with all five of the senior Farc commanders who negotiated the treaty with the Colombian government.</p> <p>Camp Diamante lies in the heart of an area known as the Yar\u00ed, after the river of that name, at a meeting point between the departments of Caquet\u00e1, Meta and Guaviare; it is steeped in the long history of war between narco-trafficking cartels, the Farc, the army and rightwing paramilitary formations.</p> <p>The Yar\u00ed land is strikingly beautiful; lush vegetation, soaring vultures and thick clusters of tiger butterflies at this time of year. It lies on a hinge between great plains to the north and thick Amazon jungle to the south-east, so that the terrain is perfect for both cultivation on the savannah and concealment within the pockets of dense equatorial foliage scattered across it. By the 1970s, the main crop across much of this terrain was coca, the raw ingredient of cocaine.</p> <p>Few people can remember peace. \u201cWe and our&#xa0;parents have seen the worst of the war around&#xa0;here,\u201d says a woman called Marcela, hosing the mud off motorbikes in Las Damas, deep within Farc territory, a sort of bandit town where the government remit has never extended.</p> <p>The Farc were formed in 1964, in response to a government attack on rural enclaves of land occupied by armed peasants affiliated to the Communist party. These peasants had organised&#xa0;themselves into communes after being forced to resettle in remote lands. They were protesting against the systemic concentration of agriculture in the hands of a few landowners (often aided by powerful militias to help seize land), which had continued from Spanish colonial rule into independence. The narrative of&#xa0;conflict in Colombia cannot be told without the story of land&#xa0;concentration in a country of plenty fenced off to many. One especially merciless attack by the state in May 1964 was mounted against the so-called Marquetalia Republic, where 1,600 troops assailed up to 1,000 armed peasants in their rural enclave. The survivors scattered and retreated further into the jungle, and from among them the Farc was&#xa0;born.</p> <p>Soon after the Farc\u2019s formation, this part of Yar\u00ed was dominated, cultivated and variously contested by its enemies: the famous Medell\u00edn cartel of Pablo Escobar and rivals from Cali, which saw these untamed lands as ideal for coca cultivation \u2013 beyond the reach of the state.</p> <p>Throughout the 1980s, Farc challenged the narcos. \u201cBy 1993, we had driven out the last of the&#xa0;mafia. There is blood in this soil,\u201d says a guerrilla officer, Juan Su\u00e1rez. \u201cAnd the following&#xa0;year we established Diamante camp.\u201d It is the control centre for Farc\u2019s extensive Bloque&#xa0;Oriental, or Eastern Front, which stretches for thousands of kilometres from the east-central plains towards the Brazilian Amazon&#xa0;forests.</p> <p>\u201cWe have taken on the role of government in an area where the Colombian state has never been,\u201d continues Su\u00e1rez. \u201cPeople here pay their taxes to us; we\u2019ve built 1,000km of road; we run the schools, hospitals.\u201d It is in these remote, neglected areas of Colombia that the Farc has thrived, developing the rural economy, providing medicine, building schools, imposing taxes \u2013 and running cocaine to pay for its war. Unlike other guerrilla groups, the history of the Farc is one of holding and governing territory, across significant swaths of Colombia\u2019s hinterlands.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If the country votes 'Yes', you won\u2019t see street parties and wild celebrations. It will be relief</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It was here, deep in its heartlands of Caquet\u00e1 and Meta, that the Farc faced intense bombardment over the past 15 years, from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/03/plan-colombia-cocaine-narcotics-farc-peace-deal\" title=\"\">Plan Colombia</a> battle strategy. Plan Colombia was initiated and supported by the United States in 2000 when the country bordered on collapse \u2013 under an attack from a combination of the Farc and narco-terrorism that disabled the institutions of the state. The police, press, judiciary and the body politic were all compromised by money or violence from leftwing terrorism, rightwing paramilitaries or cartels. Internationally, Colombia was widely seen as a failed state.</p> <p>Plan Colombia utterly changed the military balance between the government and the Farc. Laser and GPS technology turned the air force\u2019s clumsy 500lb bombs into weapons of deadly accuracy. Farc commanders could be targeted using their mobile phones. The onslaught reduced the numbers fighting for the Farc from some 15,000 in 2004 to an estimated 8,000 now \u2013 and, crucially, took out dozens of high-ranking leaders, killed by a new range of US guided missile technology. Hiding in their bamboo and canvas shelters and fighting with old Kalashnikovs and R-15 rifles, the Farc were beaten back, and very nearly wiped out. The government negotiating team in Havana are in no doubt that they bombed the guerrillas to the negotiating table.</p> <p>It was also here in Yar\u00ed that the politician \u00cdngrid Betancourt, three Americans and many others including Colombian senators and officials, were kidnapped. Betancourt was held for six years, much of that time alongside the three Americans. They were all eventually released by an intelligence sting in 2008. The three Americans subsequently wrote a book, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/feb/26/ingrid-betancourt-colombia-hostage-farc-book\" title=\"\"><em>Out of Captivity</em></a>, which detailed the horrific deprivations, loneliness and fear they suffered throughout their time in captivity. They recalled that, after weeks of marching through thick jungle when they didn\u2019t see the sun for days, they finally arrived at a jungle camp, were put in cages and forbidden to speak to one another. One of the men, Keith Stansell, a US intelligence analyst and an ex-marine recalled in an interview: \u201cYou have these kids who are just brainwashed and brought into this thing. They will, in one second, turn on you and kill you if they have to. In another second, they\u2019re just playing yo-yos.\u201d</p> <p>Kidnapping \u2013 which Farc calls \u201ctaking prisoners\u201d \u2013 of innocent people is the one activity&#xa0;many Colombians cannot forgive.</p> <p>They took 40,000 people hostage, sometimes for days, sometimes for weeks, sometimes for years. This was designed to fund the war effort, but also to enrich certain commanders. People&#xa0;were chosen as victims because their families were presumed rich enough to pay for their release. \u201cThey would stop buses full of people, and pick out the lighter-skinned people. They assumed that they would have more money,\u201d said one well-known Colombian journalist. He recalls a relative, a small&#xa0;dairy farmer who was kidnapped twice. The second time he was released after three weeks, but only after having paid a down-payment, and agreeing to monthly payments for a further three years.</p> <p>The Farc say that this was a system of imposing taxes in areas where they \u201cgoverned\u201d and provided services such as water, schools and&#xa0;hospitals where none existed. But for those who were kidnapped \u2013 and lived in fear even after their release, as they tried&#xa0;to pay the monthly instalments \u2013 it was a system of terror. At times, the Farc had upwards of 1,000 people in captivity.</p> <p>Meanwhile the Colombian army has been accused of \u201cdisappearing\u201d thousands of innocent civilians it claims were Farc combatants \u2013 the so-called \u201cfalse positives\u201d \u2013 for which many army officers have been convicted. Rightwing paramilitarism in Colombia also has an inglorious history of targeting \u2013 or \u201cdisappearing\u201d \u2013 peasants, unionists, human rights activists and supporters of leftist political movements. The soil of Colombia is steeped in the sins of all these groups.</p> <p>Now, finally, the leaders of the Farc are starting&#xa0;to admit that this orgy of \u201cdisappearing\u201d people had nothing to do with their original struggle against political and economic injustice. Last Monday, in a significant intervention, and in recognition of the problem this issue poses for Farc, Ivan Marquez, leader of the Farc\u2019s delegation in Havana throughout the four-year talks, made an explicit apology for the kidnapping of thousands of people. He said: \u201cWe want to acknowledge, with humanity and reconciliation, that during the conflict the Farc caused great pain with the retention of people for ransom. That conduct, while always used to sustain the needs of the rebellion, resulted in harming entire families.\u201d</p> <p>Like other players in this conflict, the Farc lost their way in their fight for a more just Colombia. Finally, they are coming to terms with this past, in pursuit of a new political future.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d6c474d8fd8bca8c860d4595771d7f13b503ab47\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d6c474d8fd8bca8c860d4595771d7f13b503ab47/0_0_4032_3024/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Farc guerrillas butcher meat at Camp Diamante.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Farc guerrillas butcher meat at Camp Diamante.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Mulholland</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the regional centre of Florencia, gateway to the old heartland of Farc, vultures snack on the roundabouts, old carthorses share the streets with motorbikes and crackheads sniff from their plastic tubes and bags of paste. Emaciated, desperate and close to death, these are the lost, the forgotten victims of a toxic conflict of cocaine, politics and economic injustice.</p> <p>In a basic, tiny bar, a singer of traditional vallenato music, Tito, makes a gesure of zipping his mouth when asked what he thinks about the peace process. Fear, suspicion and anxiety stalk every corner of these parts of rural Colombia. \u201cI don\u2019t think the peace can work, there are too many economic interests at stake.\u201d Tito, who is from a nearby city, cautions against speaking loudly \u2013 \u201cYou don\u2019t know who\u2019s here, or who\u2019s in control... narcos, rightwing paramilitaries, the Farc...\u201d \u2013 and motions us to quieten down. Nearby, Flora, from Florencia, is more optimistic. \u201cWe\u2019ve had it all here: narcos, Farc, the paramilitaries \u2013 it\u2019s been too much, we need peace at last.\u201d</p> <p>But Lisa, who works in a leather store in this hardscrabble town, shares the view of many Colombians when she says: \u201cWe cannot allow terrorists and kidnappers into politics.\u201d</p> <p>However, there are remarkable signs of forgiveness and reconciliation in these parts, and throughout the country, too. Javier, a driver, will vote for peace, despite the fact that his father, cousin and brother-in-law were all killed by the Farc for \u201ccrossing an invisible line in the territory\u201d when the turf war was at its worst. But Javier welcomes the accord, because, he says, \u201cit is better they do not have the guns than have them. It is better they are handed to the UN than kept in the jungle.\u201d You sense from all these people in the rural outposts of Colombia that bore the brunt that they have seen no winners in this 52-year war, only losers. They were the bystanders, the collateral, and feel beaten and brutalised. They are divided between those who hope for a better future, and those who long ago lost all hope.</p> <p>The plebiscite will deliver the popular verdict on whether the Farc are ready to be offered a way back into Colombian society. But many of those poised to vote Yes to peace are under no illusions. They are desperate for an end to the conflict, but are not driven by warmth toward the Farc. As one renowned Colombian writer \u2013 unwilling to be seen to be commentating openly \u2013 told us: \u201cTimochenko is not Mandela. If the country votes Yes, you won\u2019t see street parties and wild celebrations. It will be relief. We want peace, yes, because we are all tired, and it is better than war.\u201d</p> <p>And, unlike Mandela and the ANC, there is no prospect of the Farc storming to power in the near future. Even diehard supporters estimate that their initial electoral support might amount to about a million Colombians, which would represent a small minority of the total.</p> <p>There is also ambivalence from many of those who live in Colombia\u2019s large urban centres such as Medell\u00edn, Cali and Bogot\u00e1. In many respects the conflict did not impact much on their lives, as the Farc-army battles took place in the remote heartlands and only rarely, later on, did this war find its way into the cities. In fact, many Colombians will tell you that the savage narco wars between Cali and Medell\u00edn cartels of the 80s and 90s were a far greater scourge on their lives, when brutal massacres and car bombings ripped the hearts out of Colombia\u2019s major cities.</p> <p>But there was nothing minimal about the impact of the war in places like San Vicente del Cagu\u00e1n. Three hours south of Florencia, the Farc held this \u201cfrontier\u201d town until losing it a decade ago, during Plan Colombia. But the Farc, until now, has still controlled the trade routes in cocaine \u2013 which it \u201ctaxes\u201d \u2013 through San Vicente and beyond, with an iron hand. With the prospect of peace and the exit of the Farc as the enforcer in this town comes a vacuum and, already, armed criminal gangs and their paramilitary allies have arrived to fill it. There was a shootout and execution by men delivering drugs and cash from an armoured vehicle just days after we passed through town.</p> <p>Past San Vicente lies Las Damas. Truck after truck grinds its way down the pueblo\u2019s only street carrying supplies: bedding, food, clothing, fuel and the Farc\u2019s hallmark wellington boots. They are on their way to help with preparations for the 10th congress. A convoy of guerrillas from Farc\u2019s Bloque Sur \u2013 Southern Front \u2013 pitches up in the town for a meal, guns left in the rear of their 4x4s, barely drawing a glance from the locals. Their commander, Fernay, is pleasant, and eager to talk. War, he says, dehumanises us. \u201cWe have come to the end of our armed struggle. It had to end, and our war is now political.\u201d The pickups are full of very young guerrillas, who wait patiently for the food to be served before the ramshackle armed convoy heads off towards Camp Diamante beneath an indigo sky, through a torrent of rain.</p> <p>The headteacher at the school, built by the Farc, admits that the town\u2019s economy is dependent on the guerrilla presence, and their absence will empty its coffers. \u201cBut for as long as I can remember, Las Damas has lived outside the state; peace will bring the state to this place for the first time, and for the first time, Las Damas will feel like part of Colombia.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cbd04d54229ca7b0ca0918d28e2e1b4664446db2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cbd04d54229ca7b0ca0918d28e2e1b4664446db2/0_0_4032_3024/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Camp Diamante is in a remote, rural area where the Farc take the place of the absent state.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Camp Diamante is in a remote, rural area where the Farc take the place of the absent state.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Mulholland</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Her observation touches on one of the deeper wounds in this war-torn country. There is no doubt that Las Damas \u2013 and many places like it that have lived under narco, paramilitary or Farc control \u2013 is ready to embrace the nation that has overlooked it. It wants, finally, to come in from the cold. It wants to lie within, not outside, the reach of the state. But is the state ready to embrace places like Las Damas? Colombia has unique physical challenges, with three Andean mountain ranges slicing between its Pacific, Caribbean, mountain and jungle identities. Transport is difficult, and the Caribbean north feels a world away from the rainforests of the south-east. For much of its 200-year-plus history the state has at best ignored, and at worst deprived, those living in the rural margins of this vast country. Does Colombia now, finally, have the will, the power and the money to bring to these regions the advantages of hospitals, schools, law and order and infrastructure that the urban areas enjoy? The peace deal says it is ready to do so. If so, it would be for the first time in history.</p> <p>Colombia is a country of extremes. There are bars and restaurants in central Bogot\u00e1 that would not be out of place in London or Rome \u2013 nor would the prices. But millions live in extreme poverty, either in shanty barrios on the edges of the big cities (mostly displaced by war in the countryside), or in rural areas. Neither of these two groups have access to basic sanitation, power, proper education or healthcare. The peace deal is partly about the Farc leaving its weapons behind, but it is also about trying to open a new chapter of social, economic and political justice in a country where these have long been absent.</p> <p>Las Damas is one such place, now a guerrilla protectorate, and where our rendezvous with the Farc for onward transport to the camp is supposed to happen. It fails to materialise and instead we meet a man \u2013 let\u2019s call him Ernesto \u2013 who is part of the Farc\u2019s underground political wing, also waiting for transport to the camp. Once the Farc comes into open electoral politics \u2013 which is an explicit part of the peace deal \u2013 its centre of gravity will not be the armed men and women in the camps but men like Ernesto, who operate in a network of affiliated organisations across the land and in the cities. Farc, to succeed, will work with the churches, unions, women\u2019s groups and environmentalists to try to build a social and political movement that will give voice to Colombia\u2019s marginalised and overlooked.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/sep/16/colombia-farc-female-fighters-in-pictures\">Colombia: Farc's female fighters, then and now \u2013 in pictures</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Ernesto does not want to be identified, because he fears \u2013 as does almost every guerrilla and their civilian Farc affiliates \u2013 that known connections to the Farc could be a death sentence once the movement emerges into the open, as the peace process requires. And with good reason. The Farc\u2019s last attempt to contest elections after a peace process was during the late 1980s, when they jointly founded \u2013 with the Communist party \u2013 the Uni\u00f3n Patri\u00f3tica. This party won several towns and local seats, even a few in parliament. But over three years between 1987 and 1990, Uni\u00f3n Patri\u00f3tica was systematically wiped out by rightwing death squads. There are many shameful episodes in the recent history of Colombia \u2013 and the Farc is implicated in many of them \u2013 but the political extermination of UP ranks among the worst stains on a country with pretensions to being a mature democracy.</p> <p>\u201cFarc has many layers,\u201d explains Ernesto, \u201cacross the social movements. I\u2019m with an ecologist movement which will join with the new Farc, but not everyone will do so. And remember environmentalism in Colombia is not soft green politics. It has been a violent frontline between multinational interests and indigenous and land rights.\u201d In Colombia, environmentalism is about balancing access to land between business interests and indigenous people, an issue that has torn the country apart for decades.</p> <p>These remote lands on Colombia\u2019s margins, rich in mineral resources, are often settled by indigenous groups, and the clash of values and commercial interests threatens to spark a whole new battle once the peace deal is sealed. As if to illustrate this, while we journeyed towards the camp, an indigenous rights leader, Cecilia Culcu\u00e9, was murdered at her home in the state of Cauca by what is presumed to be a paramilitary hit squad. Culcu\u00e9 had been contesting investment by international conglomerates and also negotiating the rural reforms to which the peace deal is committed.</p> <p>Murders of people like Culcu\u00e9, human rights and trade union activists, have increased rather than abated with the peace process \u2013 there have been nine prominent executions in Cauca alone this year. \u201cOnce the government signed the peace with the guerrillas, many zones now free of conflict can be handed over to the multinationals for exploitation, which for our communities means pushing even harder to protect our natural resources,\u201d one of Culcu\u00e9\u2019s colleagues told the <em>El Pais</em> newspaper in Cali.</p> <p>Ernesto arranges a ride for us on the back of a truck in a Farc convoy with a troop of Medell\u00edn guerrillas. And so, with not a little irony, we end up hitching a lift to a remote camp with a group of guerrillas who until recently had specialised in kidnapping people. It turned out they are neither the best drivers, nor are the trucks the best equipped; a journey that should take two hours takes us eight as the vintage truck is held up time and again by deep potholes and mud. The frequency of the stops, and the depth of the water-filled craters, seem to defeat the Medell\u00edn troops who, time and again, drive straight into the holes, from which it takes hours to emerge.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f6ac78653de813ab353fe4db51e55aa5f4c57234\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f6ac78653de813ab353fe4db51e55aa5f4c57234/0_153_3945_2367/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Farc supreme commander Rodrigo Londo\u00f1o Echeverri, known by his nom-de-guerre Timochenko.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Farc supreme commander Rodrigo Londo\u00f1o Echeverri, known by his nom-de-guerre, Timochenko, in Havana.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Mulholland</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Finally, the track improves, at which point the elated driver presses hard on the accelerator, hurtling us on at frightening speed. Those in the back are thrown from side to side, praying that the truck stays upright and estimating what course of action would offer best protection if, as seems more likely, we career off the road. Eventually and safely, we arrive a few kilometres short of the camp where the Farc\u2019s warehouse stores are filled with mountains of grain, rice and flour. Outside, as if to preface the coming of peace, a group of guerrillas are playing keenly contested football on a pitch complete with makeshift goalposts.</p> <p>The entrance to the Diamante camp is marked by a Colombian flag with Farc\u2019s emblem on it and a red flag with the initials of the clandestine communist party, the PCCC, with hammer and sickle. Yet all around are the sights of everyday life. To the right, on a riverbank, a guerrilla fishes with a bamboo rod, while others cut meat and prepare an oven. To the left, the guerrillas\u2019 quarters are dug into the jungle; canopies of canvas strung atop bamboo poles. Most are empty while their occupants are about their business; in others, rebel fighters read, cook, watch films on their iPads, prepare coffee, play with a puppy or tend to weapons they will soon be handing over to UN monitors.</p> <p>Farc officer Juan Su\u00e1rez takes us through the camp. \u201cPlaces like this used to move every two or three days,\u201d he recalls of the Plan Colombia era. \u201cWe camped in groups of less than 25 comrades, the number below which a heat scanner can\u2019t detect us.\u201d He points to the deep mud at his feet, after another tropical downpour: \u201cThat\u2019s our other enemy,\u201d he says. And he recalls: \u201cMy worst moment in this war, when my father was killed during a bombing raid \u2013 I was 100 metres away. My mother left the camp after that, into the civilian movement.\u201d</p> <p>Chickens cluck and strut everywhere, steam rises from a beef stew. \u201cI want to stay with the movement whatever it does,\u201d says another guerrilla, Laura, preparing coffee. \u201cMy parents were in Farc, but they\u2019ve gone back to civilian life, still in the movement. I want to see them again. I\u2019ll do whatever the general staff says, but I\u2019d like to go back into the world.\u201d A guerrilla called Antonio makes his way along a little path, bare-chested. \u201cThere are still many problems out there,\u201d he fears. \u201cI\u2019ve been threatened by the paramilitaries before, and they\u2019ve already started killing people. This peace depends on the government too, as well as us. But we can\u2019t go back to war.\u201d</p> <p>These are the footsoldiers who, without&#xa0;exception, show remarkable,&#xa0;and sometimes unnerving levels of loyalty to their commanders and the organisation. There is a whiff of unhealthy group psychology at play, something that a new and flexible Farc will have to dispense with if they are to survive in a world of less-doctrinaire, open politics. The upside to that loyalty is a strong sense of collective spirit, and an organisation that provides a surrogate family, long after most guerrillas had left their own.</p> <p>One of these leaders, among the most charismatic, and likely to lead the Farc\u2019s new political movement, is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2016/jun/25/farc-rebel-leader-colombia-interview-carlos-antonio-lozada-supreme-urban-commander-peace\" title=\"\">Carlos Antonio Lozada</a>. A little distance from the camp, he sits beneath a gazebo, sipping whisky, and talking animatedly about the past and future. He was one of five leading commanders at the negotiating table in Havana. Since March, the <em>Observer</em> has interviewed all five commanders at length for a documentary film, and can reveal the essential logic of the Farc\u2019s high command.</p> <p>When we met in Havana earlier this year, Lozada was still amazed at the idea that he \u2013 a senior Farc commander who had fought battles for years in the jungle, and lived clandestinely in the city too \u2013 was sitting opposite the very generals he had fought against. Here was adversary versus adversary. And it was this, the inclusion of serving Colombian military \u2013 from the army and police \u2013 in the negotiations that Lozada judges to have been critical to the peace deal. \u201cSince the first dialogue in the 1980s, we always said that the armed forces had to be at the negotiating table. And until now, we never managed to get a government to take that step. I never thought guerrilla fighters and military men could talk to each other and to get to know how we both see things.</p> <p>\u201cUndoubtedly we have a connection with the other side. Both sides faced the same risks, the same situations, and we started to get to know each other and found out that we speak the same language. We lived through the same places, the same battles; the same suffering. We can talk about situations we have experienced from different sides of the spectrum, particular battles, and we hear the story from the other side. That generates empathy, understanding.\u201d</p> <p>The Farc\u2019s supreme commander, Timochenko,&#xa0;is a former coffee plantation worker who cut a relaxed figure in Havana last March as we interviewed him for several hours in the garden of &#xa0;a restaurant on the city\u2019s outskirts, near the hotel in which his negotiating team had been locked in talks with the government for four years.</p> <p>He explained why he thought now, after so many years, the Colombian government and the Farc had been willing to find a way out. \u201cThey hit us very hard with Plan Colombia, yes. We never deny that. But they didn\u2019t finish us off. We\u2019re still there, firm. The guerrilla fight is very dynamic, it has fluxes and refluxes. And then Santos opened the door to talks. And I think it is because they didn\u2019t defeat us. Because they are tired. Because war has limits. The machinery gets tired and also men get tired.\u201d</p> <p>But those years of talks have clearly impacted all sides, including veteran guerrillas such as Timochenko. \u201cAll Colombians have felt the pain, for one reason or another. The pain of the mother of a guerrilla fighter is the same as the pain of the mother of a soldier. We are from the same fatherland, so we cannot use this process to throw salt into the wounds of the other side. It\u2019s about how we agree to heal those wounds. We cannot sow the seeds of another conflict.\u201d</p> <p>Timochenko paid tribute to Cuba and to the late Venezuelan leader Hugo Ch\u00e1vez for enabling talks. \u201cUntil his dying breath, Ch\u00e1vez wanted us to find peace,\u201d he says. \u201cHe wanted us to enter politics and win our wars through elections as he did. He gave us the security to know that nothing would happen [to us] if we entered these talks. He was our guarantor there would be no dirty tricks.\u201d President Santos\u2019s first call as he considered initiating a peace process was to Ch\u00e1vez, to see if the Venezuelan president would support and, in effect, offer guarantees to Farc ahead of the talks.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"03427eee9cc750b7e1162b82406d305a6aaff2b1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/03427eee9cc750b7e1162b82406d305a6aaff2b1/1437_25_3043_1826/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The leader of Farc\u2019s negotiating delegation for the peace deal, Iv\u00e1n M\u00e1rquez.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The leader of Farc\u2019s negotiating delegation for the peace deal, Iv\u00e1n M\u00e1rquez, in Havana.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Muholland</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This was a remarkable move from Santos given that, under the hardline presidency of his predecessor, \u00c1lvaro Uribe, Colombia and Venezuela had been on the brink of war just months earlier. The Farc\u2019s relationship with Ch\u00e1vez was especially problematic, since Venezuela offered sanctuary to many guerrillas and senior commanders. Ch\u00e1vez also did little to close down narco routes across their shared border and helped arm the Farc at a time when Colombia\u2019s own army was under extreme pressure.</p> <p>The Farc\u2019s proximity to Ch\u00e1vez drew strong resentment from many Colombians who resented Chavez\u2019s influence over the Farc. In retrospect, given the then-tension between the two countries, the call from Santos to Ch\u00e1vez may prove to have been the most important of all.</p> <p>One of those Farc leaders who was given refuge in Venezuela was the leader of Farc\u2019s negotiating delegation, Iv\u00e1n M\u00e1rquez. He studied philosophy with a priest before joining the Communist party and then the Farc, emerging as a senior military commander and crucial figure in the guerrillas\u2019 strategic and doctrinal direction during war and towards peace. His discourse on war and politics is studded too with moments of personal loss, something common to Colombians from all walks of life in this conflict.</p> <p>We meet him in Havana in March among the lambent colours of a floral display in another restaurant garden, with the sound of crowing cockerels drifting through the tropical suburb. M\u00e1rquez too has had time to reflect on the pain caused both by the Farc, and to him personally.</p> <p>\u201cTwo of my brothers were victims of the repression and persecution. My brother Alvaro&#xa0;was murdered horribly in Florencia. He was captured by the intelligence services. I could&#xa0;never imagine those things could happen. His toes were cut off, his eyes were pulled out, he&#xa0;was burned with cigarette butts and they dragged him from Florencia to Morelia. There\u2019s a beautiful river there, and a high bridge. They threw him from the bridge into the river. He was&#xa0;not an activist, just my brother. In Florencia,&#xa0;a&#xa0;couple of years later, they took my other brother Alfonso. That was the fault of the military bosses.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/11/farcs-child-soldiers-start-new-life-after-peace-deal\">Farc's child soldiers start new life after peace deal</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It is horrors such as these \u2013 perpetrated by all sides \u2013 with which Colombia now has to reckon. The peace agreement, says M\u00e1rquez, \u201cis a starting point. Because the political fight continues, but not with weapons any longer. With words, discourse, looking in earnest for a country in which people can live with more humanity.\u201d</p> <p>It is Carlos Lozada and others who are likely to be in the vanguard of pitching the Farc\u2019s new political project (and newly named party) to a sceptical public. Lozada insists that \u201cwhen Farc comes into the open, our idea is to embrace a rainbow of Colombians\u201d \u2013 an ambition that would&#xa0;make Farc a rare organisation, incorporating Caribbean Colombians from the north coast, mostly black Colombians from the Pacific edge, mountain people from the Andes, peasants from the vast plains and indigenous tribes of the rainforest \u2013 in addition to the urban masses, which include all of these.</p> <p>\u201cWe are betting on having a space in the political spectrum that runs from the democratic&#xa0;sectors to the left. It is not going to be&#xa0;a Marxist movement; it will be a wide proposal,&#xa0;where different sections can converge. When the Farc come out in the open, legal political fight, you will see an organisation that is a reflection of how we think of Colombians \u2013 if you go to the pacific coast, you will see a guerrilla made up of Afro-Colombians, if you go to the Cauca, those are indigenous, if you go to the Meta, they are people from the Llanos, and if you go to the northern front they are Caribbean. Our political proposal is going to be a reflection of our nation and an alternative to a regime of political domination over the decades.\u201d</p> <p>But at the heart of those talks in Havana were the victims of the conflict. Five groups representing those who had been bereaved in the war went to Havana to confront the government and the Farc. It was their participation that proved a turning point for all sides.</p> <p>Lozada recalls: \u201cWhen we started welcoming the delegates from the delegations of victims, we stopped seeing the victims as just&#xa0;statistics and numbers, but [instead saw them] as human beings and they have pain and suffering and inevitably that produces a transformation. We were quite struck that none of the victims that came here to Havana asked for revenge. They all asked us to continue this discussion at the table and not to stand up until we finish what we came here to do \u2013 which is essentially a peace&#xa0;agreement.</p> <p>\u201cWhen one sees the tenderness of the people, the capacity of human beings for reconciliation, to forgive, that generates commitments, and one understands there is in the deep soul of our people a wish for peace and reconciliation. And so none of the opposing camps on the table can fail on that.\u201d</p> <p>Two years ago President Santos recognised this same mood when he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/nov/08/colombia-juan-manuel-santos-farc-peace-violence\" title=\"\">told the <em>Observer</em></a>, \u201cI am doing everything possible to teach people how to reconcile, and one thing I have discovered is that the victims are more ready to pardon and reconcile than the average citizen. If the victims are ready to pardon and to forgive, then that is a very strong basis for peace to be sustainable in the&#xa0;long run.\u201d</p> <p>Another day begins at Camp Diamante, with low but strong sunlight on the roof of a cowshed next to our quarters, from which \u201cranchera\u201d accordion music drifts across the savannah morning. A cowboy called Dimas herds cattle towards their milking parlour and says: \u201cI want peace, but I\u2019m a cowboy and I just want to stay here. I don\u2019t want to change my life and I don\u2019t want to risk it.\u201d</p> <p>Concealed deep into the jungle lies the encampment\u2019s hospital compound, at the centre of which is a large, open-sided canopy hung with the Farc\u2019s emblem, the PCCC flag and a portrait of Che Guevara. In charge here is Dr Uriel Quindio, who has been performing state-of-the-art surgery in this remotest corner of Latin America. \u201cI learned medicine here,\u201d he says, \u201cat our own medical school \u2013 as good as any in Colombia.\u201d</p> <p>Quindio\u2019s worst memory, he says, was during the bombing, when many were badly injured: \u201cOne man in particular, after a 150mm mortar fell \u2013 he lost both arms and legs and had internal injuries. I attended to him and he kept saying: \u2018I don\u2019t want to die, hold me.\u2019 He survived here for two months.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6366ec35e1fe2a6de57ab765fdce5c5d8a0f63e8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6366ec35e1fe2a6de57ab765fdce5c5d8a0f63e8/120_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Carlos Antonio Lozada\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Farc commander Carlos Antonio Lozada, who came face to face at the peace talks with an army general who had tried to kill him during the war.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Quindio\u2019s story is as ironic as it is timely at this moment. \u201cI didn\u2019t join a guerrilla organisation,\u201d he explains. \u201cI joined in the village of C\u00f3rdoba, near here, when Farc had become a political organisation during the 1980s; Uni\u00f3n Patri\u00f3tica. There were no opportunities in the area, and so much poverty and violence I believed in a legal communist movement. But the UP was exterminated, and I was one of many young people at that time who found myself in the armed struggle because the Uni\u00f3n Patri\u00f3tica had been eliminated.\u201d He agrees that \u201cthings have come around again, but this time we will surrender our weapons, so I hope for a different outcome\u201d.</p> <p>Diamante will now become one of 31 so-called \u201ctransition zones\u201d to which all the Farc\u2019s guerrillas and supporters in the clandestine networks are to converge after Sunday\u2019s vote, if it returns a Yes to the peace accords. There, the Farc\u2019s arsenal will be progressively handed over to monitors from the UN\u2013 proportionately, according to an agreed timetable \u2013 with rings of police and military nearby but not present. The process is to be completed within six months \u2013 the longest armed insurgency disarmed.</p> <p>Every organisation in Colombia\u2019s conflict has a justified charge sheet to answer for. The army, paramilitaries, narco cartels, and the Farc have all committed appalling atrocities. Reckoning with these is the guiding principle of a groundbreaking transitional justice mechanism devised between&#xa0;Farc and the government in Havana, and is crucial to the legacy of next Sunday\u2019s vote. Its guiding principles include one whereby confession to serious crimes by all parties entitles perpetrators to \u201calternative sentences\u201d such as house arrest and community service, while failing to come forward to confess crimes against humanity is punishable by lengthy jail sentences.</p> <p>The transitional justice mechanism was hammered out in the context of those that followed peace and justice arrangements in South Africa, Rwanda and Ireland \u2013 and is hailed as a landmark attempt to incorporate the best from all these experiences, while avoiding some of the&#xa0;pitfalls.</p> <p>It carefully balances all three models to create what seasoned international lawyers deem to be a gold standard, with the former president of the international criminal court in The Hague, Argentine <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/luis-moreno-ocampo\" title=\"\">Luis Moreno Ocampo</a>, going so far as to liken it to <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/7f31dd84-68b5-11e6-a0b1-d87a9fea034f.html#axzz4KuREXWXA\" title=\"\">\u201ca work by Van Gogh that only gained public recognition after he died\u201d</a>.</p> <p>Salient whispers from both sides in Havana indicate that the process of truth and justice stands a chance of reckoning with three generations of violence. However, rigidity digs in, and to those voting against the peace process next weekend, this tentative common reckoning amounts to amnesty for, and appeasement of, terrorism. For those voting in favour, the plebiscite and peace constitute the epic moment of a lifetime: that is, not just to end South America\u2019s longest conflict, but to transform Colombia into a more equal, just society, free of the entrenched privilege that has scarred it since independence in 1810. A chance, too, to begin the search in earnest for Colombia\u2019s tens of thousands of missing, as well as reckon with its dead.</p> <p>To no small degree, the accords wrought in Havana, unthinkable five years ago, have been a&#xa0;matter of face-to-face encounter, and a mutual&#xa0;will to understand the other. M\u00e1rquez, reflecting in Havana on the past four years, says something extraordinary about General Mora, against whom he fought so many battles in the jungle. \u201cMora is a good guy. If I knew him beforehand I would not have battled him the way I did. It\u2019s surprising for me.\u201d</p> <p>If peace holds, maybe together they can help build a new Colombia, one where the next three generations escape the terrors of the last three.</p> <p>Before night falls at the camp, we repair to our quarters next to the cowshed, where one female guerrilla cuts, plaits and arranges another\u2019s hair. Both giggle uncontrollably, their 1980s Yugoslav-made weapons slung on to hooks beside the cooking area, in which meal after meal of rice, beans, plantain and beef soup are prepared. The cowherds and a couple of young fighters come in to watch a football game. This is all they have: the Farc is their family, the ideology their identity; none has a clear idea of life without this routine.</p> <p>On the other hand, a guerrilla called Antonio squelches his way from the riverbank bivouac to a sodden track through dense, dripping palm leaves.

This vast camp is now entirely abandoned, its installations reaching far into the dense foliage: bivouacs, tents and sturdier structures in what little dappled sunlight penetrates the roof of leaves overhead.</p> <p>There is a school, or what some would call a centre for indoctrination: a few sturdy wooden chairs remain and from the cane beams hang posters for ideological education: there\u2019s a eulogy to Timochenko, and a warning of: \u201cTotal Crisis. One day, the poor will have nothing left but to eat the rich.\u201d A poster with a hammer and sickle promises that \u201cThe Workers and Peasants Bring Change and Regeneration\u201d. And another, \u201cYou buried me and did not know I was a seed.\u201d Then there\u2019s one instructing on the use of Microsoft Office and Windows.</p> <p>Beneath the school, there is a large bomb shelter. Nearby, the commander\u2019s discreetly private quarters and beneath that another smaller shelter, his own. All now lie empty. There are cooking stations, bathing pools and innumerable paths that guerrillas presumably took to escape \u2013 for moments \u2013 the reality of endless war.</p> <p>There is almost total silence here, apart from the lazy purr of cicadas\u2019 wings and the occasional&#xa0;caw of a bird, and rustle of wings through the trees. Not a trace of wind in the humid pyrexia of mid-afternoon. The camp was evacuated eight days before our visit, in anticipation of the peace deal: the bustle and grime of guerrilla life, the bedlam of bombing, wailing of the wounded and crash of ordnance are all in the mind now. And if the peace deal is endorsed, in the past.</p> <h2>The peace accord: the key provisos</h2> <p><strong>1 Comprehensive rural reform</strong> in a country where unequal land ownership has been the cause of much violence, and of thriving coca-growing due to paramilitary and guerrilla control over tranches of land. The government will support rural communities and promote sustainable economic growth by granting more land accessibility though a special fund. There will be specific development, infrastructure and poverty reduction programmes as well as food and nutritional security initiatives.</p> <p><strong>2 Political participation by Farc, under a new name, in the democratic process. </strong>The condition of Farc laying down weapons and abandoning armed struggle is absolute. Having done so, Farc members will be provided with the possibility of advancing their political agenda through the Colombian democratic system. They will do so under the same rights and obligations as other political parties and movements. The government is committed to provide the necessary security measures to make sure Farc members can exercise their right to participate in politics, after the annihilation of Uni\u00f3n Patri\u00f3tica.</p> <p><strong>3 End of the conflict.</strong> Immediately after the final agreement, Farc members will start to establish 23 \u201cTransitory Rural Settlement Normalisation Zones\u201d and eight \u201cTransitory Points of Normalisation \u201d (smaller, for fewer guerrillas). Farc will then have 180 days to surrender all weaponry to the United Nations. At the end of the 180 days, the Normalisation Zones and Points will be disabled; Farc members, once totally and irreversibly disarmed, will start their reintegration process into Colombian society and the political process.</p> <p><strong>4 A solution to the problem of illicit drugs.</strong> A landmark achievement in the wider aim of the Colombian government to rewrite the premises of the war on drugs, solving the crisis at the production end, and turning a spotlight on the responsibilities of consuming countries. Farc commits to cut all links to drug trafficking, support an illicit crop eradication programme, and to provide information and support for mine-clearing efforts that will alleviate humanitarian concerns and make coca eradication more efficient. Pilot programmes involving joint patrols between the army and Farc have already begun.</p> <p><strong>5 Victims and transitional justice.</strong> A framework to satisfy victims of the conflict will balance reintroduction of guerrillas into public life and the punishment of war crimes. Negotiations drew on experience in the wake of crises and conflicts in South Africa, Ireland, the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda. The government and Farc agree to create the Comprehensive System for Truth, Justice, Reparation and Non-Repetition. All sides will collaborate to tell and document historical truth, search for and identify missing persons, repair individuals and communities affected by conflict and investigate, prosecute and punish the most representative human rights violations in the context of the armed conflict.</p>",
  "<p>Tsai Ing-wen is new to the job and the strain is beginning to show. Elected president of Taiwan in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/16/taiwan-elects-first-female-president\" title=\"\">a landslide victory</a>, she <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/20/taiwans-new-president-tsai-ing-wen-vows-to-reduce-dependence-on-beijing\" title=\"\">took office in May</a>, buoyed by high approval ratings. Yet in a few short months, Tsai\u2019s popularity has plunged by 25%. The reason may be summed up in one word: China. Suspicious that Tsai\u2019s Democratic Progressive party, which also won control of parliament, harbours a pro-independence agenda, Beijing suspended official and back-channel talks with its \u201crenegade province\u201d and shut down an emergency hotline.</p> <p>More seriously, for many Taiwanese workers, China also curbed the lucrative tourist trade, which brought millions of mainland visitors to the island during the accommodating presidency of Tsai\u2019s predecessor, Ma Ying-jeou. <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/world/asia/la-fg-taiwan-tsai-snap-story.html\" title=\"\">Cross-strait investment and business</a> have also been hit.</p> <p>Tsai faces contradictory pressures. The public wants the benefit of closer economic ties with China but Beijing\u2019s intentions are rightly distrusted by a population that increasingly identifies itself as Taiwanese, not Chinese. Given President Xi Jinping\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-asia-apec-china-taiwan-idUSBRE99503Q20131006\" title=\"\">ominous warnings</a> that reunification cannot be delayed indefinitely, China\u2019s military build-up and hawkish suggestions that Beijing may resort to force, Taiwanese ambivalence is wholly understandable.</p> <p>This dilemma \u2013 how to work constructively with a powerful, assertive China without compromising or surrendering national interests \u2013 grows steadily more acute. It is shared by states across the east and southeast Asian region. From Indonesia and the Philippines to Vietnam, Japan, Seoul, Malaysia and Singapore, the quandary is the same. But the answers proffered by national leaders are different and sometimes sharply at odds.</p> <p>The China dilemma is felt strongly in Washington. The US has striven in recent years to strengthen Asian alliances, increase trade and raise its regional military profile \u2013 Barack Obama\u2019s so-called rebalance or <a href=\"http://foreignpolicy.com/2016/09/03/the-legacy-of-obamas-pivot-to-asia/\" title=\"\">pivot to Asia</a> \u2013 in a bid to contain and channel China\u2019s ambitions peacefully. But analysts say the pivot appears to be in trouble. For Europeans fixated on Syria and immigration, this may not seem especially worrying or relevant. That\u2019s shortsighted. If Obama and future US presidents get China wrong, the resulting damage could be global, threatening the security and prosperity of all.</p> <p>Obama is already badly off-track. His grand plan to promote interdependent economic self-interest across the Pacific Rim while excluding China \u2013 the Trans-Pacific Partnership or TPP (similar to the controversial US-Europe Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership or TTIP) \u2013 is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/25/trans-pacific-partnership-provisions-questionable-says-productivity-commission\" title=\"\">in deep trouble</a>.</p> <p>Shinzo Abe, Japan\u2019s prime minister, declared last week that the TTP was a crucial \u201cpillar\u201d of future US influence. \u201cSuccess or failure will sway the direction of the global free trade system and [shape] the strategic environment in the Asia-Pacific,\u201d Abe said.</p> <p>His warning reflected alarm in Tokyo that a risk-averse Obama is again proving an unreliable partner and will fail to get the deal ratified by Congress. It has already been disowned by both his most likely successors, Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"01e0893e6786bda86d6309e0b9869771507e2fbf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/01e0893e6786bda86d6309e0b9869771507e2fbf/68_0_2063_1238/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An image from United States Navy video purportedly shows Chinese dredging vessels in the waters around Mischief Reef in the disputed Spratly Islands.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An image from United States Navy video purportedly shows Chinese dredging vessels in the waters around Mischief Reef in the disputed Spratly Islands.<br></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: HANDOUT/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Washington\u2019s painfully obvious inability to curb China\u2019s controversial island-building programme straddling the international shipping lanes of the South China Sea is seen as further evidence that the pivot is failing. Each week seems to bring news of another Chinese airstrip or newly fortified reef. Ignoring neighbouring countries\u2019 rival claims, Chinese has effectively unilaterally annexed 80% of the sea\u2019s area, through which passes $5tn of world trade annually. \u201cFreedom of navigation\u201d patrols by US warships, soon to be backed by Japan\u2019s navy, have had little discernible impact while increasing the risk of direct military confrontation.</p> <p>China has flatly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/12/philippines-wins-south-china-sea-case-against-china\" title=\"\">rejected a precedent-setting UN court ruling</a> that deemed its claim to own the Spratly Islands, also claimed by the Philippines, to be illegal. Beijing has taken a similarly intransigent stance in its dispute with Japan over the Senkaku (Diaoyu) Islands in the East China Sea.</p> <p>Some observers detect ulterior motives. China\u2019s military construction on the Spratlys and \u201cits effort to exhaust and eventually displace Japan in a contest for the Senkakus can be seen as an attempt psychologically and physically to isolate Taiwan and to prepare the battle space for China\u2019s possible use of military force to unify the PRC and Taiwan\u201d, an <a href=\"http://www.iiss.org/en/publications/strategic%20comments/sections/2016-e7c1/turbulence-in-the-taiwan-strait-c26e\" title=\"\">analysis</a> by the International Institute for Strategic Studies said.</p> <p>Perceived American weakness has led some allies to take matters into their own hands. It <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-southchinasea-taiwan-idUSKCN11R109\" title=\"\">emerged last week</a> that Taiwan\u2019s military is also engaged in island fortification, at Itu Aba, its sole possession in the South China Sea.</p> <p>More dramatically still, the maverick Philippines president, Rodrigo Duterte, <a href=\"http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2016-09-14/duterte-turns-back-us-orders-philippines-buy-weapons-russia-and-china\" title=\"\">switched sides last week</a>, announcing Manila would cease maritime co-operation with the US. China, he said, was the stronger partner. Duterte\u2019s shift reflects his anger at American criticism of human rights abuses rather than a deep strategic rethink. But it will certainly hearten Beijing.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>This feeble anxiety to play down differences, and evident lack of confidence in US leadership, plays into China\u2019s hands</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Other regional players are more cautious, an attitude encouraged by Beijing\u2019s divide-and-rule tactics. Vietnam\u2019s prime minister, Nguyen Xuan Phuc, meekly agreed in talks with Xi this month that \u201cmaritime co-operation through friendly negotiations\u201d was the best way forward. But like China, Hanoi is rapidly building military capacity and cementing alliances with India, among others, in anticipation of less amicable times ahead.</p> <p>Similar diplomatic hedging of bets was on display in Laos this month, when an Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) summit deliberately avoided mention of the UN court ruling. This feeble anxiety to play down differences \u2013 and evident lack of confidence in US leadership \u2013 plays into China\u2019s hands.</p> <p>The China dilemma extends far beyond the South China Sea. Having made nuclear disarmament a top priority in 2009, Obama has failed dismally to halt North Korea\u2019s accelerating pursuit of nuclear weapons. The threat was underscored by Pyongyang\u2019s<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/09/north-korea-nuclear-test-earthquake\" title=\"\"> biggest ever test explosion</a> earlier this month. China, the only country with real leverage, has helped impose additional UN sanctions on North Korea. But it has consistently balked at taking game-changing measures, such as cutting off fuel oil supplies, which could force Kim Jong-un to think again. Beijing also says it will block \u201cunilateral\u201d measures by other countries.</p> <p>Obama\u2019s impotence has intensified questions in Japan and elsewhere about the credibility of the American security umbrella, encouraging nationalists who argue that Tokyo should re-arm in earnest \u2013 or even deploy its own nuclear weapons. But their main concern is not North Korea \u2013 it is China.</p> <p>Xi is not looking for a fight. His first-choice agent of change is money, not munitions. According to Xi\u2019s \u201cOne Belt, One Road\u201d plan, his preferred path to 21st-century Chinese hegemony is through expanded trade, business and economic partnerships extending from Asia to the Middle East and Africa. China\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.clsa.com/special/onebeltoneroad/\" title=\"\">massive Silk Road investments</a> in central and west Asian oil and gas pipelines, high-speed rail and ports, backed by new institutions such as the Asia Infrastructure Investment Bank, are part of this strategy, which simultaneously encourages political and economic dependencies. Deng Xiaoping once said to get rich is glorious. Xi might add it is also empowering.</p> <p>Western neoliberals are optimistic. They typically argue that market-based economic exchanges can produce a win-win situation for rival states. In this way, China\u2019s rise may be peacefully accommodated, they say.</p> <p>Xi must also calculate that time is on China\u2019s side. \u201cChina\u2019s economic development and military modernisation programmes have witnessed dramatic progress since the early-1980s,\u201d said Karl Eikenberry in the <a href=\"http://www.the-american-interest.com/2015/06/09/chinas-place-in-u-s-foreign-policy/\" title=\"\"><em>American Interest</em></a>. \u201cChina\u2019s aggregate GDP in 1980 was the seventh largest in the world\u2026 By 2014, China\u2019s GDP had multiplied 30 times to more than $9tn and is now the second largest in the world\u2026 The PRC\u2019s military spending, less than $10bn in 1990, grew to more than $129.4bn in 2014, second only to that of the US.\u201d On current trends, China\u2019s 2035 GDP could be a third larger than the US, Eikenberry said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"319fa7dff33d84e5d4a210edbbd8b957d66d6d87\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/319fa7dff33d84e5d4a210edbbd8b957d66d6d87/0_146_4000_2399/1000.jpg\" alt=\"People watch a TV news showing an image that North Korea\u2019s Rodong Sinmun newspaper reports of the ground test of a high-powered engine of a carrier rocket at the country\u2019s Sohae Space Centre in Seoul, South Korea.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">People watch a TV news showing an image that North Korea\u2019s Rodong Sinmun newspaper reports of the ground test of a high-powered engine of a carrier rocket at the country\u2019s Sohae Space Centre in Seoul, South Korea.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ahn Young-joon/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Yet for less sanguine analysts, this prospective disparity, this growing lack of balance, plus the expanding number of potential flashpoints in the South China Sea, Taiwan and elsewhere, point only one way \u2013 towards future military conflict between the US and China. The Pentagon now officially refers to the Chinese \u201cthreat\u201d.</p> <p>This is the so-called \u201c<a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2015/09/united-states-china-war-thucydides-trap/406756/\" title=\"\">Thucydides Trap</a>\u201d, a reference to the Athenian historian\u2019s account of the seemingly inevitable conflict between the rising city-state of Athens and the status quo power Sparta in the fifth century BC. Nowadays, the US is the status quo power and China the bumptious usurper.</p> <p>Open conflict is not inescapable, but it is under active discussion. A recent <a href=\"http://nationalinterest.org/blog/the-buzz/new-report-details-why-war-between-china-america-would-be-17210\" title=\"\">study by the Rand Corporation</a> made a detailed examination of who might \u201cwin\u201d such a military showdown. It concludes that it would probably be catastrophic for both sides. Yet the study also suggests that, if war cannot be avoided, the US might be best advised to strike first, before China gets any stronger and the current US military advantage declines further.</p> <p>The dilemma is clear: amid rising nationalism in both countries, China is not willing to have its ambitions curbed or contained and the US is not ready to accept the world number two spot. These two juggernauts are on a collision course. It\u2019s unclear who or what can prevent a pile-up.</p> <h2>The other players in the conflict between Beijing and Washington</h2> <h2><strong>JAPAN</strong><br></h2> <p><strong>Faced by what it perceives to be a growing threat from China, Japan\u2019s government, led by its conservative prime minister, Shinzo Abe, has sought greater freedom to project military force beyond the country\u2019s borders. This is controversial, since it involves the \u201creinterpretation\u201d of Japan\u2019s postwar pacifist constitution. Concrete steps include joint naval patrols with the US in the South China Sea and direct help for coastal states such as the Philippines.</strong></p> <h2>VIETNAM <br></h2> <p><strong>The communist one-party regime in Hanoi is an unlikely partner for the US, given still painful memories of the Vietnam war. But Vietnam has been wooed by Obama and George W Bush as part of Washington\u2019s attempts to control and channel China\u2019s regional ambitions. Vietnam has been involved in deadly fishing grounds clashes with China, with whom it fought a war in 1979. It has also sought help elsewhere. Earlier this month, the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, offered a $500m credit line for defence co-operation. But Hanoi is</strong> <strong>also carefully hedging its bets by keeping</strong> <strong>diplomatic lines open to Beijing</strong>.</p> <h2>INDONESIA<br></h2> <p><strong>The world\u2019s most populous Muslim country, Indonesia has vast human and natural resources and is seen as one of the new 21st-century economic players. Anxious to balance development needs and national pride, President Joko Widodo </strong><a href=\"http://time.com/4379401/indonesia-china-jokowi-natuna-sovereignty-maritime-fishing-dispute/\" title=\"\"><strong>recently visited the Natuna Islands</strong></a><strong> in the southern South China Sea, scene of repeated, minor fishing boat clashes with Chinese vessels. Widodo vowed to defend \u201csovereign territory\u201d against foreign encroachment. But, officially, Indonesia calls itself a \u201cnon-claimant\u201d country and says it is not formally in dispute with Beijing. This suits both countries, at least for now. By sidestepping their differences, they can get on with business.</strong></p> <h2>SOUTH KOREA <br></h2> <p><strong>The Seoul government is more worried about its unpredictable northern neighbour than it is about China. Its defence minister said last week that South Korea has </strong><a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/2016/09/23/asia/south-korea-plan-to-assassinate-kim-jong-un/\" title=\"\"><strong>plans in place to assassinate Kim Jong-un</strong></a><strong> and the North Korean leadership if the nuclear threat becomes critical. Seoul sticks close to the US, which maintains military bases in the country. But abiding South Korean distrust of Japan, Washington\u2019s other key east Asian ally, dating back to the Second World War, has undermined attempts to present a united front to Beijing \u2013 with which Seoul maintains friendly relations.</strong></p> <h2>INDIA<br></h2> <p><strong>Like China, India is rapidly expanding its military capabilities, spending an estimated </strong><a href=\"http://www.defenseworld.net/news/15986/Reliance_Defense_Eyeing_Indian_Defense_Market_Worth__100_Bn__Receives_16_New_Licenses#.V-U8hXqHr7I\" title=\"\"><strong>$100bn on new defence systems</strong></a><strong> since Narendra Modi became prime minister in 2014. Like China, its ambition is to project itself as a regional superpower looking both east and west. This potentially brings the two countries into conflict. They have long-standing border disputes in the Kashmir/Xinjiang and Arunachal Pradesh areas. In a forerunner to Obama\u2019s pivot to Asia, George W Bush\u2019s administration launched a strategic partnership with Delhi, partly as a counterbalance to China. For its part, Beijing maintains close</strong> <strong>ties with Pakistan, India\u2019s historical foe.</strong></p> <h2>RUSSIA <br></h2> <p><strong>China and Russia are old enemies dating back to the cold war, but these days, they claim to be close friends. A visit to Beijing by President Vladimir Putin in June saw the launching of a number of </strong><a href=\"https://www.rt.com/business/348391-putin-china-visit-rosneft/\" title=\"\"><strong>trade and oil deals worth up to $50bn</strong></a><strong>. China sees Russia as a valuable provider of raw materials but also as a political and military partner in relation to the US. In defiance of Washington, the two countries held large-scale war games in the South China Sea last week, practising taking over islands in disputed waters. Putin also values collaboration as a way of circumventing sanctions imposed by the US and EU after Russia\u2019s invasion of Crimea.</strong></p>",
  "<p>Grabbing the listener by the lapels has never seemed an overriding preoccupation for LA\u2019s Warpaint. They have preferred to court attention in circuitous, free-form ways.

It may have spent the summer feasting on the contents of your fruit bowl, but not until your assembled plums and peaches were starting to rot. But while gastronomic sensitivity is a characteristic to be applauded in a fly, the drosophila, to give it its official title, has more going for it than good table manners.</p> <p>For the past century, it has also performed the vital function of a scientific and medical research tool. Today, it\u2019s often the first stop in research into a wide range of human illnesses, including Alzheimer\u2019s disease, Huntington\u2019s disease, spastic paraplegia, cancer and obesity. By comparison with mice and dogs, let alone apes and humans, it\u2019s massively cheap and easy to work with and there is little chance of drawing protest from even the most radical anti-vivisectionist.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The males follow the females and put out one wing and vibrate it\u2026 it\u2019s a\u00a0kind of love\u00a0song</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In many respects its position as a vital research tool is a historical accident. Between 1910 and 1915, the pioneering American geneticist Thomas Hunt Morgan worked on <em>Drosophila melanogaster</em> in his renowned Fly Room at Columbia University and showed that genes provide the basis for chromosomal heredity, for which he won a Nobel prize. It was a critical breakthrough, but there was no particular reason that it had to be made via the fruit fly. Yet ever since then, the tiny drosophila has been at the forefront of genetic research. In the 1920s, another American geneticist, Hermann J Muller, demonstrated that radiation leads to genetic mutation in fruit flies. The reason we\u2019re careful about exposure to x-rays is no small part due to Muller\u2019s work.</p> <p>But some of the mutations that Muller produced, such as flies with legs coming out of their heads, later played into the postwar period of atomic paranoia, informed George Langelaan\u2019s short story The Fly, which was made into a film first in the 50s and then <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/the-fly\" title=\"\">remade by David Cronenberg</a> in the 1980s.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"295d0a549fafa3c69abaae3aacf78a1809d77308\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/295d0a549fafa3c69abaae3aacf78a1809d77308/0_0_3504_2333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jeff Goldblum mid-mutation in David Cronenberg\u2019s 1986 The Fly\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jeff Goldblum mid-mutation in David Cronenberg\u2019s 1986 film The Fly.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sportsphoto Ltd /Allstar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the story and the films, a scientist mutates into a fly, an idea that\u2019s disturbing precisely because we see ourselves as being so utterly different from flies, with their strange bodies and massive, honeycombed heads and distinctly creepy habits. This deep-seated anxiety about flies has led to some famous misunderstandings of biology. The most egregious example was in 2008, when Sarah Palin, running for vice-president in the US presidential elections, told an audience that their money was going \u201cto projects that have little or nothing to do with the public good. Things like fruit fly research in Paris, France. I kid you not.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/oct/27/sarahpalin-genetics-fruit-flies\">Adam Rutherford: Sarah Palin and the fruit fly</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Despite Palin\u2019s clueless misgivings, one of the reasons that flies have become important to much genetic and medical research in relation to humans is that they bear a remarkable genetic similarity to us. The sci-fi fear of a fly\u2019s otherness may well be based, somewhere way down, on its unsettling closeness to us.</p> <p>It was Michael Ashburner, the godfather of fruit fly research at Cambridge, who first established that of the genes that in their mutant form cause diseases in humans \u2013 cystic fibrosis being one example \u2013 around 75% have very similar equivalents in fruit flies. When Ashburner started out in the 1970s, flies were kept in milk bottles in a temporary lab on the outskirts of Cambridge. As a result of his foundational work, which includes his classic book <em>Won For All: How the Drosophila Genome Was Sequenced</em>, Cambridge has become arguably the world\u2019s leading centre of fruit fly research.</p> <p>Its Fly Facility is run by one of Ashburner\u2019s former PhD students, Simon Collier, who showed me around the labs and fly storage of the facility. He\u2019s been working with fruit flies for 25 years and in that time he\u2019s come to know and appreciate many of their hidden \u2013 to most human observers \u2013 characteristics.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It\u2019s pretty straightforward to look at their genome. You just squish them up in a tube and do some simple DNA extraction</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cIf you take a tube of flies and leave it here you notice that they have behaviours,\u201d he says. \u201cThe males court the females. They follow the females and put one wing out and it vibrates. There\u2019s a guy in Leicester who\u2019s researched this and what they\u2019re doing is producing a kind of love song.\u201d</p> <p>Apparently, the females are not looking for a long-term relationship and, indeed, they\u2019re likely in their short life span to have multiple partners. The problem with this for geneticists is that they store sperm so paternity is a disputed issue. To counter the confusion of this flagrant promiscuity, geneticists tend to work with virgin females.</p> <p>How can they tell? I ask.</p> <p>\u201cThe look in their eye,\u201d Collier says&#xa0;drily.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bdcf2ed5591e5cc85b833fed281eee1ccec0fd7e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bdcf2ed5591e5cc85b833fed281eee1ccec0fd7e/0_0_3770_2872/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A colourised SEM micrograph of the head of a fruit fly (Drosophila sp.), magnified 70 times\" width=\"1000\" height=\"762\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A colourised SEM micrograph, magnified 70 times. of the head of a fruit fly, showing compound eye.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Hartman/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He shows me a magnification of a load of fruit flies that have been knocked out by carbon dioxide. They\u2019re still twitching but essentially stationary. He points out the differences between males (a bit smaller) and females and shows that young flies \u2013 virgins if you like \u2013 are pale and unpigmented.</p> <p>He explains that for research purposes special chromosomes have been developed that enable geneticists to trace exactly what genes have been inherited. With mice, for example, it\u2019s necessary to check gene by gene what\u2019s been inherited, which makes genetic research much more time-consuming and costly.</p> <p>Because the fruit fly\u2019s life cycle is so short and they reproduce so fast (sexually maturity is reached within eight days of hatching), drosophila are ideal subjects for the study of inherited traits, including genetic abnormalities, over many generations.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The common ingredient in human and fly behaviour is the gene FOXP, closely linked to cognitive development in humans</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Still, to the layman, even one slightly more versed in the exigencies of scientific research than Sarah Palin, there\u2019s something profoundly counterintuitive about doing genetic research on flies. For one thing, they\u2019re so small. Doesn\u2019t that make it a whole lot trickier?</p> <p>Collier shakes his head. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty straightforward if you want to look at the fruit fly\u2019s genome. You just put them in a tube and squish them up and do some simple DNA extraction. What\u2019s more complex is going the other way \u2013 implanting genetic material into them.\u201d</p> <p>He takes me to a special lab where this procedure is carried out. They take the fly larvae and strip the eggs off their shells by sticking them in bleach. Then with a long and extremely fine needle, the relevant genetic material is injected into the posterior of the eggs where the germline cells are located.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"531cf2b8000113b38517a168dc197fbf2a8b6ff8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/531cf2b8000113b38517a168dc197fbf2a8b6ff8/185_325_4133_2192/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Drosophila melanogaster eye colour variations - white and red (wild type).

It takes about six months to master the minute motor skills necessary to do the job.</p> <p>\u201cUsually half the embryos will survive that procedure,\u201d says Collier. \u201cAnd we can breed from them and study them.\u201d</p> <p>But study what exactly? And to what end?</p> <p>Collier introduces me to two colleagues who are active in fruit fly research, a reader in genetics called Cahir O\u2019Kane and Damian Crowther, a director of neuroscience research and development at the pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca, who still retains links to the Fly Facility.</p> <p>We go out to lunch and talk fruit flies. I ask Crowther first of all why he left academic research to go into industry.</p> <p>\u201cThe story I tell,\u201d he says, \u201cis friends, and perhaps even enemies, would always introduce me as, \u2018This is Damian, he\u2019s the fly guy\u2019. In my time, I\u2019ve been a registrar in neurology and a research scientist in many areas \u2013 I didn\u2019t think fly guy really summed me up.\u201d</p> <p>O\u2019Kane echoes the point and both men agree that fly research has not brought them either the professional or social recognition they believe their work warrants.</p> <p>What seems to matter most, in terms of professional appreciation at least, is what is known as \u201ctranslation\u201d, that is, turning the findings of fly research into productive contributions to medical applications for humans. There is little doubt that fly research does contribute, in a wider sense of biological understanding of how all organisms work, but also in specific examples of human disease. However, it\u2019s not easy to make direct links.</p> <p>It\u2019s problematic, for obvious reasons, to go from fly tests to human tests; there usually needs to be a whole range of intervening stages in which other scientists take over and, inevitably, take the spotlight and accreditation.</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t tell you that there\u2019s a drug that I\u2019ve tested on fruit flies [with an artificially created version of Alzheimer\u2019s disease] that\u2019s benefited the fruit fly that\u2019s then gone on to benefit the human,\u201d says Crowther.</p> <p>But, he explains, Alzheimer\u2019s involves the overproduction of proteins that form plaque in the brain that destroys neurons. \u201cSo you can make models of flies that produce these proteins, get their own plaque and die,\u201d he explains, \u201cand you can then test various ways of preventing the plaque formations.\u201d</p> <p>Fruit flies don\u2019t naturally develop Alzheimer\u2019s, although they have all the genetics of the Alzheimer\u2019s pathway in their brain.</p> <p>\u201cYou have to give them human equivalent genes and push it really hard to get them to have Alzheimer\u2019s in three weeks,\u201d explains Crowther.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6b69a5635b3faac5150e25c31912a3ae20c8cf67\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6b69a5635b3faac5150e25c31912a3ae20c8cf67/0_0_3867_2404/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Life cycle stages of the fruit fly, Drosophila sp, showing larva, pupa, adult male (dark abdomen) and adult female\" width=\"1000\" height=\"622\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Life cycle stages of the fruit fly, Drosophila sp, showing larva, pupa, adult male (dark abdomen) and adult female.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ed Reschke/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Instead of thinking of fly research as a direct route to medical breakthroughs, it\u2019s better to see it, Crowther argues, \u201cas a way of doing quick and dirty research\u201d. He believes that because it\u2019s so cheap, it should be used in a multiplicity of ways that might point the direction to more productive lines of research. And where there are drugs that have already been tested on humans and have passed safety requirements but have failed in their efficacy with the targeted complaint, they could be retargeted by first testing them on flies.</p> <p>\u201cThe thinking around really bad diseases like motor neurone disease, Huntington\u2019s disease, is if you can get anything to work in a cell culture replicated in an organism, that\u2019s the beginning \u2013 as long as it\u2019s safe \u2013 of quickly getting it to patients,\u201d says Crowther.</p> <p>O\u2019Kane is particularly suspicious of overblown claims for translation. For him, the beauty of the fruit fly is that it is a organism that rewards study in a larger context.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2015/aug/20/fruit-fly-african-scientific-research-kampala\">Can the humble fruit fly help create a flourishing African scientific community?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cI\u2019m interested in it because I think it\u2019s a great system for finding out how living things in general can work. I think by understanding the principles of how flies work then you can make better predictions for humans. The better you understand how we work the more rational you can be about trying to design therapies; I think even without directing your work towards therapy, then you can think more intelligently about therapies five or 10 years down the line.\u201d</p> <p>It has been said, not least by Collier, that more is known about the biology of the drosophila than any other animal on Earth. For instance, we know that fruit flies have a kind of built-in compass in their brains that enables a sense of direction. As all animals need to know how they move, it\u2019s not unreasonable to assume that it\u2019s a form of universal computation.</p> <p>Another study has shown that male fruit flies that are rejected by a female mate are more inclined to drown their sorrows in food spiked with alcohol than male fruit flies that had successfully mated. Again, a brain chemical that regulates the flies\u2019 appetite and is predictive of their thirst for alcohol has an equivalent that has been linked to alcohol consumption in humans.</p> <p>In another study, this time at Oxford, it was found that fruit flies are capable of what might be termed thoughtful deliberation. Rather than making purely impulsive decisions, they take time to react when presented with a difficult choice.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Obviously we're more sophisticated, because we're studying them, they're not studying us</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In other words, once again their behaviour could be described as human-like. It seems that the common ingredient in both human and fly behaviour is a gene called FOXP, which is closely linked to cognitive development in humans. Flies with defective FOXP take longer to arrive at a decision, just as defects in the human type of FOXP have been correlated with low intelligence.</p> <p>It is this long and valuable history of study of the drosophila that should guarantee its continued involvement in genetic research. But much of what has been good about working with flies is now being replicated in human stem cell research, which has the added advantage of being species-relevant. This was the other reason why Crowther moved into the private sector: the competition from stem cells meant that he found it increasingly difficult to get fruit fly-based research funded.</p> <p>\u201cThe fly is yesterday\u2019s guy,\u201d he says, \u201cyesterday\u2019s technology. For me, stem cells are the next fruit fly.\u201d</p> <p>O\u2019Kane looks quite glum at the prospect and argues that there have been questions over the future of fruit fly research ever since he started his lab 25 years ago. But he maintains that the work he\u2019s done in hereditary spastic paraplegia would have taken 10 times longer to perform with mice. O\u2019Kane has grown to appreciate the rich biological and social development of fruit flies in the time he\u2019s been working with them.</p> <p>\u201cThe more you look at their behaviour,\u201d he says, \u201cthe more sophisticated you realise they are. Even in aggression, how a male fruit fly behaves in a fight will depend on his previous experience of fighting with other males and what the other males\u2019 previous experience of fighting is. It\u2019s amazing to think about all the machinery that\u2019s involved to be able to do that. Obviously we\u2019re more sophisticated, because we\u2019re studying them, they\u2019re not studying us.\u201d</p> <p>For the time being, until some over-ambitious genetics professor does manage to mutate into a fly, that\u2019s the way the relationship should continue. And both humans and fruit flies, it turns out, can drink to that.</p>",

  "<p>There is an unnerving surprise at the start of this show. It is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/rothko\">Mark Rothko</a>\u2019s self-portrait. The artist of those numinous veils of colour, his aims (and his rhetoric) so transcendent, turns out to be a big lug in a brown jacket who can\u2019t draw his painting hand and botches his mouth. He is wearing tinted spectacles.</p> <p>Rothko, along with his colleagues <a href=\"http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artists/adolph-gottlieb-1195\">Adolph Gottlieb</a> and <a href=\"http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artists/barnett-newman-1699\">Barnett Newman</a>, is responsible for the abiding utterance of abstract expressionism. \u201cThe subject is crucial, and only that subject matter is valid which is tragic and timeless.\u201d This subject matter \u2013 painted big and painted simple, or so they claimed \u2013 was as much about the human condition as any figurative self-portrait. That some of their colleagues might be more interested in landscape, colour or \u2013 God forbid \u2013 naked women, is only one of the innumerable ways in which this statement fails to unite conceivably the most disparate of all art revolutions. And so it is with this show.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"3338349ef0ad1c20246449e413b319defc92971b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3338349ef0ad1c20246449e413b319defc92971b/0_0_4324_5447/794.jpg\" alt=\"Self-Portrait, 1936 by Mark Rothko.\" width=\"794\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Self-Portrait, 1936 by Mark Rothko.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: \u00a9 1998 Kate Rothko Prizel &amp; Christopher Rothko ARS, NY and DACS, London</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It is a colossal event, to be sure: our first major ab ex show in more than 50 years, with 163 works from across four decades, including sculptures, photographs and prints. The paintings get bigger with every room, from Jackson Pollock\u2019s tiny, writhing friezes of the 1930s to voluminous late Rothko and a whole canyon of mountainous paintings by Clyfford Still, whose works are notoriously difficult to borrow.</p> <p>The devastating black humps of <a href=\"http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artists/robert-motherwell-1673\">Robert Motherwell</a>\u2019s <em>Elegy to the Spanish Republic</em> paintings march onwards \u2013 their power undiminished, impressively, even when reprised as a print \u2013 feathery grief clattering through the funereal procession. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/jackson-pollock\">Jackson Pollock</a>\u2019s magnificent <em>Blue Poles </em>(1952), shipped in from Australia, tilt away like masts in a manic sea of energy and colour. Willem de Kooning\u2019s <em>Dark Pond</em> glitters with black secrets, and his luscious pink nudes sprawl seductively in the golden dusk. It is thrilling to set eyes on these works.</p> <p>And it is marvellous, too, to go from the opening gallery of self-portraits straight into the dancing abstract biomorphs of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2010/feb/14/arshile-gorky-retrospective-review\">Arshile Gorky</a> next door. From the Metropolitan Museum in New York comes his glorious <a href=\"http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/works-of-art/56.205.1/\"><em>Water of the Flowery Mill</em></a>, with its rustling depths and erotic liquidity. Around it, forms flying like leaves on the breeze, lines leaping among blossoming drifts of colour, is a group of paintings that allow one to contemplate the elusive source of joy in Gorky\u2019s art, present even when the titles indicate darkness. De Kooning once said it was something beautiful in the atmosphere of his paintings, and so it mysteriously seems.</p> <p>A De Kooning is subtly introduced among the Gorkys to indicate the Armenian\u2019s influence on the Dutchman \u2013 so many of the New York School, as they were also known, were not American. When you come to the exquisite De Kooning gallery later on, you will recall Gorky\u2019s beautiful lariat lines.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Abstract paintings lose their force of personality when strung like washing on a line</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>So far, so promising: a succession of condensed solo shows of great artists long stinted in British museums (some, such as <a href=\"http://joanmitchellfoundation.org/work\">Joan Mitchell</a> and <a href=\"http://adreinhardtfoundation.org/\">Ad Reinhardt</a>, scarcely shown here at all). But this dream dissolves almost immediately. There are awkward themed rooms on gesture and colour in which paintings by artists with no natural affinities are displayed like slideshow examples. There are disastrous, not to say unkind groupings \u2013 Gottlieb, Reinhardt and Newman, lumped together by geometric composition, as if flat rectangles were their timeless subject \u2013 and sightlines that diminish the painters.</p> <p>It is good, for instance, to see Franz Kline\u2019s snow-and-thunder paintings, with their fierce black brushmarks; except that the open view to Motherwell makes Kline look like a weak disciple (which he wasn\u2019t). Philip Guston\u2019s hovering clouds of colour \u2013 surely abstract impressionism \u2013 are so lyrical and gentle they make an early Joan Mitchell look more of a squall, heavily scrubbed into the canvas.</p> <p>This is redeemed much later on with a magnificent Mitchell frieze that holds the memory of summer in its golds, whites and greens: a euphoric balancing act in which foreground and background are held in equal tension. Are you looking at, or through, colour?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"5e8553821ba13b8a85742db9433488e5865f36cc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5e8553821ba13b8a85742db9433488e5865f36cc/0_0_4096_2616/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018A euphoric balancing act\u2019: Salut Tom, 1979 by Joan Mitchell at the Royal Academy.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"639\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018A euphoric balancing act\u2019: Salut Tom, 1979 by Joan Mitchell at the Royal Academy.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andy Rain/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This is the advanced art of America in the 1940 and 50s \u2013 unbound, free of illusion, definition, the constraints of the canvas, the bonds of earth, even, if you listen to the esoteric utterances of Newman or Rothko. Rothko can take care of himself, and indeed gets a quasi-chapel of his own in the RA rotunda. But Newman is persistently hampered. His art asks you to look at paintings in new ways, literally in the case of a soaring monument such as <em>Ulysses</em>, rearing high on the wall above you with its oceanic colours and its fine, bright zip dividing light from darkness, or land from sea. Any sense of infinity is compromised by the paintings crowding around it. And there is Reinhardt on the opposite wall, his geometric abstracts nearly subliminal in their subtlety of tone, their surfaces so delicate and pensive. Art isn\u2019t a contest; Reinhardt should not knock Newman off the wall.</p> <p>The value of this show lies in the opportunity to see such wildly beautiful art quite possibly for the first time \u2013 the flicks, drips and pourings, the veils, stripes and zips, the glowing oblongs and hanging gardens, the sheer perpetuum mobile of brushmarks. Anyone prepared to make the effort can just about deduce this experience intermittently in the throng. But abstract paintings lose their force of personality when strung like washing on a line, each canvas deactivating the next, and this is what happens to <a href=\"https://clyffordstillmuseum.org/clyfford-still/\">Clyfford Still</a>.</p> <p>The paintings scale mountains, your eyes scale the paintings: immense cliffs of craggy paint, pierced by hairline cracks and lightning fissures. They ought to inspire and overwhelm. But so many close together and these paintings lose their awesome power of isolation.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f08ba80fc364c1ee9fbf65819030ffed3d1fa53b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f08ba80fc364c1ee9fbf65819030ffed3d1fa53b/10_0_4076_2445/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The towering paintings of Clyfford Still.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The towering paintings of Clyfford Still.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andy Rain/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>You would hardly think the Pollock room could falter, but it does. There are a few works that carry light like phosphorescence in their ribboning skeins, but others feel like turgid repetitions. The inclusion of Lee Krasner\u2019s <em>The Eye Is the First Circl</em>e does her no favours at all. It is indubitably one of her more famous works, but this dung-coloured painting from 1960 looks like a very late reprise of Pollock, thus shoving her straight back into the Man and Wife show of 1949 where she was first \u201cdiscovered\u201d as Pollock\u2019s wife.</p> <p>There has never been \u2013 and never will be \u2013 any general consent about exactly who the abstract expressionists were and how they were connected. Cliche associates them, collectively, with alcohol, divorce, depression and suicide; with a fateful sense of mission, and heroic labour that doesn\u2019t always equate with their lives as social beings, irascible and hammered in Greenwich Village\u2019s <a href=\"http://art-nerd.com/newyork/cedar-tavern/\">Cedar Tavern</a>.</p> <p>This show certainly avoids all that boilerplate, and seeks to expand the standard circle. But any selection that includes a severe wooden construction by Louise Nevelson, parked like a bookcase against the wall, and one of Guston\u2019s late, great cartoon-like tragicomedies is not just tendentious but counterintuitive, stretching in too many directions. Some might argue that it is good to see this wider period context, and many more of the lesser works too. But I can\u2019t agree: I would have preferred the pure rush of exhilaration that comes with the greatest abstract expressionism.</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.royalacademy.org.uk/exhibition/abstract-expressionism\">Abstract Expressionism is at the Royal Academy, London until 2 Jan</a></p>",
  "<p>L-E-V is an Israeli dance company created by choreographer Sharon Eyal and multimedia event designer Gai Behar. The two have been <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/sharoneyallev\" title=\"\">working together</a> since 2006, and have been joined for recent projects by the percussionist and techno musician <a href=\"https://orilichtik.bandcamp.com/\" title=\"\">Ori Lichtik</a>. Their most recent work, <em>OCD Love</em>, was inspired by a text by the poet Neil Hilborn. It describes a relationship in which a woman is initially charmed but later exasperated by the compulsive tics that beset the male speaker. \u201cI couldn\u2019t stop reading it,\u201d writes Eyal. \u201cFor me it was already choreography.\u201d</p> <p>Watching <em>OCD Love</em>, it\u2019s striking how perfectly music and choreography can reflect the obsessive-compulsive state. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnKZ4pdSU-s\" title=\"\">Hilborn\u2019s poem</a> describes a life punctuated and hyperextended by ritual: \u201cAt night, she\u2019d lay in bed and watch me turn all the lights off... And on, and off, and on, and off, and on, and off, and on, and off, and on, and off.\u201d Lichtik\u2019s score is insistent and reverberant, with lush, shuddering strings. It makes its case, as techno music does, by repetition. Themes are developed and reprised, often with minute variations, as ticking percussion rises and falls.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Is it agony we see on her face as she submits to the rituals imposed on her, or ecstasy?</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Eyal\u2019s choreography performs a similar function. L-E-V\u2019s six dancers are almost hynotically attuned to each other. They move on a common breath, either as a febrile and quivering phalanx (a motif that shows the influence of the distinguished Israeli choreographer Ohad Naharin, for whom Eyal used to dance, as did Hofesh Shechter), or as individuals excavating the stage space with scooping, cleaving deliberation.</p> <p>A female dancer appears to be the piece\u2019s subject, and while she strives fearfully for autonomy, it becomes clear that she is animated by the five others, who form a shadow-corps around her. She can never escape them for long, and at times they wholly control her, physically manipulating her every move. Her reaction is ambiguous. Is it agony we see on her face as she submits to the rituals imposed on her, or ecstasy? As the curtain falls, we see her arching backwards, further and further, but how this action resolves itself we will never know.</p> <p>If we recognise her predicament, it\u2019s because at some level it echoes our own embodied anxieties. The piece, Eyal writes, is \u201csomething that I need to take out of myself, like a dark stone I have in my chest\u201d. Dark it may be, but Eyal\u2019s choreography has a grave beauty. It\u2019s hard to hold out against the seduction and blessed submission that she offers. We\u2019re all somewhere on the spectrum.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUe9gGxKWMk\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/GUe9gGxKWMk?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUe9gGxKWMk\">Watch a trailer for OCD Love.</a></figcaption> </figure>",

Market research group NPD, which claims to measure around 70% of the UK toy trade, has recorded a 20% rise during the past year in the sales of tabletop games (including card and dice games, war games played with miniature figures and role-play titles such as Dungeons &amp; Dragons, in which players imagine themselves as heroic warriors and wizards in imaginary, fantasy worlds).</p> <p>Ben Hogg, marketing manager at UK distributor <a href=\"http://www.esdeviumgames.com/\">Esdevium Games</a> (which imports the US-produced railway adventure Ticket to Ride, among many other titles) estimates that growth at closer to 35%.

But specialist retailers were rare, so they put in an offer on a small, semi-constructed shop space. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t even a floor,\u201d Wooding says. \u201cIt was all just rubble.\u201d They raided skips to decorate the shop\u2019s interior in medieval dungeon style and scattered straw over the unfinished floor.

More friendly.\u201d </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The awful thing about Monopoly is the first person to go bankrupt is left in a corner and everyone else plays on</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Catherine Howell, curator of toys and games at the V&amp;A Museum of Childhood in east London, describes Pandemic as \u201cthe game of the moment\u201d. She chose it as one of four focus games, alongside chess, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_of_the_Goose\">Game of the Goose</a> and Monopoly, in her exhibition <a href=\"http://www.vam.ac.uk/moc/exhibitions/gameplan/\">Game Plan: Board Games Rediscovered</a>. Howell describes herself as more of a traditional gamer, whose strongest memories of childhood are playing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/shortcuts/2016/sep/05/braconid-brett-smitheram-2016-world-scrabble-championship-quixoty-felty\">Scrabble</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/09/cluedo-dr-orchid-sexy-scientist\">Cluedo</a> with her family. She confesses that, until she began thinking about the exhibition around five years ago, she wasn\u2019t familiar with the new wave of board games that populate the shelves of Orc\u2019s Nest and Thirsty Meeples, part of what she calls a \u201cdesigner-led resurgence\u201d that originated in Germany, then spread across Europe and North America. But she was struck by advances in game design that made the experience of playing these games far less fractious (and more enjoyable) than those family Monopoly sessions. </p> <p>\u201cEurogames\u201d, as they are known, are notable for their relatively gentle themes (farming, landscape-building, dock-working), the fact that they reduce the element of luck and \u2013 most importantly \u2013 the way they ensure no player is eliminated before the end. The game zero for this revolution is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catan\">The Settlers of Catan (now rebranded Catan)</a>, created by a German designer, Klaus Teuber. Since its publication in 1995, it\u2019s sold more than 22m copies in 30 languages. Players competitively establish settlements on an island and trade resources with the other players, deeping participants fully engaged and sustaining the drama of the narrative right to the conclusion. \u201cThat\u2019s very important,\u201d says Howell, \u201cbecause nobody feels left out. That\u2019s the awful thing if you\u2019re playing Monopoly: the first person to become bankrupt is left in the corner while everyone else plays on.\u201d </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/aug/28/20-awesome-board-games-you-may-never-have-heard-of\">20 awesome board games you may never have heard of</a> </p> </aside>  <p>That crucial development finds its ultimate refinement in the most recent tabletop trend, the \u201cco-operative game\u201d, whereby every player wins or loses as a team member, whether fighting fires (Flash Point) or saving the world from infection (Pandemic). \u201cIt provokes a lot more social interaction,\u201d says Howell. </p> <p>Pandemic was created by a 43-year-old Californian, Matt Leacock, who is one of tabletop gaming\u2019s most successful designers. He was inspired by <a href=\"https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgamedesigner/2/reiner-knizia\">Reiner Knizia\u2019s 2000 Eurogame title Lord of the Rings</a>, which requires players to cooperate as one of the four questing hobbits from Tolkien\u2019s fantasy epic. \u201cWhen I played that with friends we got scared,\u201d recalls Leacock. \u201cThere was self-sacrifice. There were all sorts of highs and lows. At the end, everybody felt good, whether they won or lost. I wanted to see if I could do something like that.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"065db9791696b4138f57f9db570bd1ecf29ac1de\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/065db9791696b4138f57f9db570bd1ecf29ac1de/0_0_1200_900/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Ticket to Ride board\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Ticket to Ride board.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ticket To Ride</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Leacock\u2019s passion for board games goes back to his experience of frustration with them as a child. \u201cGames were my favourite birthday gift,\u201d he says, \u201cbut I\u2019d get very excited, open up the box, then we\u2019d play and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/oct/02/are-these-the-10-worst-board-games-of-all-time\">there would just be crushing disappointment</a>. The games never seemed good enough to me.\u201d So, with the help of a game-enthusiast uncle, young Leacock would flip over the boards and try to design something better using the same components.</p> <p>Decades later, while leading the design team at a communications start-up, he concocted Pandemic, curious to see if he could create a game \u201cwhere there was a lot of really frightening non-linear growth\u201d \u2013 in other words, sudden surprises and twists. At the time, he recalls, pandemics were \u201cin the news\u201d, with outbreaks of bird flu and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/sars\">Sars</a>, \u201cso that was very much in the back of my mind\u201d.</p> <p>Pandemic has been a runaway success, and the latest version, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jan/25/pandemic-legacy-review-emotional-highs-agonising-lows\">Pandemic Legacy: Season One</a>, represents another leap forward in game design. Co-created with rising board-game star Rob Daviau, it incoprorates, Leacock explains \u201ca tremendous amount of storytelling. It\u2019s similar to an electronic game in that you develop your characters, you get new rules and the state of the world changes. Irrevocably, in fact. It is an unveiling story. We named it Season One because it has an arc, so it\u2019s akin to watching a season of one of your HBO favourites.\u201d </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/oct/12/dont-worry-board-games-video-games-cant-steal-what-makes-you-great\">Don't worry, board games: video games can't steal what makes you great</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The growth of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/oct/12/uk-video-game-industry-gets-4m-funding-boost\">video games industry</a> has, perhaps counterintuitively, been one of the biggest factors in the proliferation of these modern, innovatively designed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/board-games\">board games</a> \u2013 largely because the presence of games consoles under so many millions of TVs and the rise of mobile gaming have normalised game-playing.</p> <p>\u201c[Video games and board games have] <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/aug/22/what-video-games-can-learn-from-board-games\">learned an awful lot from each other</a>,\u201d says Esdevium\u2019s Ben Hogg. \u201cEveryone\u2019s a mobile gamer now.

Now there are more people who are open to the idea of playing a game than ever before.\u201d (It\u2019s also not uncommon to find app versions of board games, such as the popular map-building game Carcassonne, which works very well on a tablet.</p> <p>At the same time, crowdfunding sites such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/sep/14/how-kickstarter-became-one-of-the-biggest-powers-in-publishing-crowdfunding\">Kickstarter</a> have lowered the barrier to entry for people trying to break into the board-games industry.

There is now something known as the TableTop effect: if Wheaton features a title on his show, in which he and other celebrities play a game while commentating on their decisions, its sales will spike. \u201cThe TableTop effect is massive,\u201d says Peter Wooding. \u201cIf Wil features a game, it immediately becomes unavailable!\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>You connect with people across the table.

If we\u2019re to emerge from the goddamn dumpster fire that is 2016 intact, we\u2019re gonna need to see our shared humanity, and I [hope to] show by example that tabletop gaming can be about the journey you go on together when you\u2019re playing a game. It can be about the friendships and relationships that form. So when I hear games are selling out all over the place, that thrills me. It means that people who are not already gamers, or maybe not as insane about it as I am, they\u2019re going out and buying them. It\u2019s like Muggles are buying tickets to Hogwarts.\u201d</p> <p>Back at Thirsty Meeples in Oxford, I talk to owners John and Zuzi Morgan. In 2012 they decided to sell tickets to Wheaton\u2019s Muggles, quitting their jobs as social workers to try and turn their love for tabletop games into a full-time business. </p> <p>They already had an extensive game collection, and John had heard about a cafe in Toronto named Snakes &amp; Lattes \u2013 the menu listed games rather than meals \u2013 that had sparked the spread of board-game cafes across North America. After a visit to sample its appeal, the Morgans opened Thirsty Meeples (a \u201cmeeple\u201d is a game component that represents the player, typically in Eurogames a plump, triangular wooden figure), and it\u2019s certainly paid off. \u201cThe trend is upwards,\u201d John tells me when I ask how business is doing.</p> <p>Why does Zuzi think the love of tabletop games grew to such a point that she and John could turn their hobby into their livelihood? \u201cThere\u2019s so much technology,\u201d she says. \u201cEverybody\u2019s busy and you want to bring people back together in a way that\u2019s not just staring at screens.

Then multi-player video games moved online, and fellow players became physically removed from one another, if not completely anonymous. In some digital gaming arenas, that anonymity brewed a poisonous atmosphere.</p> <p>\u201cMulti-player video-gaming was fun,\u201d says Wil Wheaton. \u201cAnd then dickheads ruined it. It just became this cesspool of toxic aggression and unpleasant behaviour. I wonder if people who had enjoyed all that at first started looking for another way to play games where you could see the person you were playing with.\u201d</p> <p>Direct interaction is important to Matt Leacock, too. \u201cYou connect with people across the table,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a very human thing.\u201d And it\u2019s tactile: \u201cYou need to handle the physical components, to get the feel for the texture on the cards and see the wood grain on your components.\u201d</p> <p>Gaming has always had a social function. Fernand Gobet, Professor of Psychological Sciences at the University of Liverpool and co-author of <em>Moves In Mind \u2014 The Psychology Of Board Games</em>, says that in some countries \u201cplaying a board game is part of the culture \u2014 such as mancala games in some African countries \u2014 and can be seen as a soft kind of initiation ritual. But in most countries, the benefit of board games is to offer the opportunity for families to play. In a sense what matters is having such a common activity, and not the detail of the game being played.\u201d</p> <p>These points are echoed by Thirsty Meeples\u2019 patrons. \u201cIt\u2019s the more social thing to do these days,\u201d says Mark, a 35-year-old information modeller from Portsmouth.</p> <p>Roger and Eveline, the couple playing Ticket to Ride, explain that they are in the middle of packing up all their worldly possessions to return to the Netherlands because, says Roger, \u201cwe can no longer afford to live in Oxford.\u201d As cafe regulars, they couldn\u2019t depart without enjoying one final session. \u201cWe seem to be living in an age where we\u2019ve become scared of our sophistication,\u201d he says. \u201cWe crave things that feel authentic.

  "<p>Antoine Fuqua\u2019s remake of John Sturges\u2019s 1960 western <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Azotnag9HI\">stirs up the racial mix</a> of the seven gunfighters a little. Leading the team is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/sep/15/denzel-washington-chris-pratt-the-magnificent-seven-interview\">Denzel Washington</a>\u2019s cool-headed Chisholm; he is backed up by, among others, the South Korean actor Byung-hun Lee playing the knife specialist Billy Rocks; Manuel Garcia-Rulfo stars as the Mexican bad boy Vasquez and the Native American actor Martin Sensmeier, rather underserved in the way of dialogue, as the Comanche warrior Red Harvest.</p> <p>But while this is a welcome update to the formula, in most other ways this is a stolidly traditional western. Fuqua shoots in widescreen, using tawny saturated colours that evoke the era of the original. The camera cringes slightly in front of the heroes: they are frequently shot from just below chin level, the better to emphasise manly jawlines and all-round studliness. The score, by James Horner and Simon Franglen, hits every western-genre cliche in the book: from hoedown fiddle to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jun/07/from-the-classical-archive-1960-aaron-copland-interview\">Aaron Copland</a>-style Americana. And despite the feisty widow Emma Cullen (Haley Bennett) claiming to have a monopoly on balls in the besieged small-town community of Rose Creek, there\u2019s a touch of casual sexism here. When Emma saves Chisholm by shooting an adversary, he walks over and takes her rifle, later handing it to the nearest man.

  "<p>\u201cThere has been a great deal too much surrendering in this war,\u201d wrote <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/nov/03/churchill-factor-review-boris-johnson-winston\" title=\"\">Winston Churchill</a> in 1899. He was only 24 at the time but the war in question, against the Boers, was the fourth he had attended. (He had also written and published two books.) He had narrowly escaped being shot in Cuba. He had reported on the war in Sudan. On British India\u2019s north-west frontier he had gone into battle against the Pashtun, making himself conspicuous on a white pony bought, as he candidly told his brother, because it would \u201cattract attention\u201d if he rode about on it \u201cwhen things looked a little dangerous\u201d.</p> <p>Attention, according to <a href=\"http://candicemillard.com/\" title=\"\">Candice Millard</a>, was what Churchill was after. He was already aiming for the highest political office. To achieve it, he needed first to cover himself in military glory. \u201cThis is a pushing age,\u201d he wrote to his mother, and push he diligently did. Bystanders were repelled and impressed. \u201cI don\u2019t like the fellow,\u201d wrote Lt Gen Sir George White, \u201cbut he\u2019ll be prime minister of England one day.\u201d Churchill believed he was entitled to the best of everything. Aged 15, after a train journey, he wrote, \u201cI won\u2019t travel 2nd again, by Jove.\u201d He lost his first election but, lacking a parliamentary seat, he spoke out for war from the steps of his birthplace, Blenheim Palace.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"022fbdbda00be206d18cd455d2ea848e903ba082\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/022fbdbda00be206d18cd455d2ea848e903ba082/0_0_1741_1792/972.jpg\" alt=\"Churchill as a reporter for the Morning Post during the Boer war.\" width=\"972\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Churchill as a reporter for the Morning Post during the Boer war.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Everett/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Millard\u2019s book tells of just one episode in his life. Churchill himself has recounted it, and so have other participants, but it makes a gripping story, and this version casts an interestingly oblique light on Churchill\u2019s personality, and on a traumatic war.</p> <p>For Millard, Churchill (whose mother was American) is not an embodiment of the British bulldog breed. Rather, he is one of those ambitious men \u2013 boiling over with surplus energy and devoted to a toxic ideal of honourable manliness \u2013 who abounded on both sides of the Atlantic at the beginning of the 20th century. Millard\u2019s Churchill resembles <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4986859\" title=\"\">Theodore Roosevelt, the subject of her earlier book</a>.</p> <p>For her, the history of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/1999/sep/04/books.guardianreview\" title=\"\">Boers</a>, too, is full of American echoes. They were pioneers, dissidents who left Europe. Dragging their wagons together at night for protection, they pushed ever further into the interior of what seemed to them a God-given and empty continent, \u201cdevastating entire populations\u201d of indigenous people and \u201ctaking over vast swaths of their land\u201d. They rode their farms gun in hand. They had no standing army. They were all Lone Rangers. And, like many Americans, they bitterly resented the British who patronised them and competed with them, and who had undermined their right to own slaves.</p> <p>Immersing herself in her period\u2019s mindset, Millard has picked up its prose style. Her sentences are sumptuously upholstered. When she means \u201cBritish army\u201d, she says \u201cmost revered and reviled fighting force in the world\u201d; when she means \u201ccoal\u201d, she says \u201cthe black historic remains of swamp and bog vegetation\u201d. She piles up adjectives. Houses are \u201cbreathtaking\u201d. London is \u201cglittering\u201d. Women are \u201cblindingly beautiful\u201d. Enemies are \u201cirresistible and terrifying\u201d. When not gushing about \u201cstunning\u201d events, \u201cdramatic\u201d encounters and \u201cdevastating\u201d defeats she is capable of cod-Churchillian orotundity. None of this verbiage, though, gets in the way of her story</p> <p>She follows the ponderous progress of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/century/1899-1909/Story/0,6051,126325,00.html\" title=\"\">General Redvers Buller</a>, \u201cthe Steamroller\u201d, southward. By the time Buller, with Churchill in his train, reached Cape Town, Ladysmith was besieged. Churchill, supposedly a non-combatant reporter, took part in an ill-planned escapade involving an armoured train. Reminding himself of Napoleon\u2019s dictum: \u201cWhen one is alone and unarmed, a surrender may be pardoned,\u201d he allowed himself, despite his earlier views on surrendering, to be taken prisoner.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"f17fa80c11e293a950b5ed9aab4804019d7e7a1d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f17fa80c11e293a950b5ed9aab4804019d7e7a1d/0_0_2596_3503/741.jpg\" alt=\"Young Winston in circa 1899 during his service in the South African Light Horse\" width=\"741\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Young Winston in circa 1899 during his service in the South African Light Horse</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hulton Archive/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Captivity was \u201cthe greatest indignity of my life\u201d. Two others planned an escape. Their brother officers selflessly helped them. Churchill hijacked the plan, insisting on coming too. They didn\u2019t want him \u2013 he was \u201cunfit, too famous and he couldn\u2019t keep a secret\u201d \u2013 but couldn\u2019t say no to him. The escape was bungled. He went ahead on his own, and then made his way alone across hundreds of miles of enemy territory to the coast. It\u2019s a thrilling journey, and Millard tells it with gusto. The jumping on to a moving train. The despair out on the veldt. The nights hiding in a mine with rats gnawing his candles. The men who risked their lives to help him (they were rewarded with gold watches). The long journey hidden among bales of wool on a freight train. The arrival at the British consulate in Louren\u00e7o Marques, where the doorman told the filthy stranger that no, the consul would not be free to see him until the following day, and the wildly over-entitled young aristo bellowing with rage in the courtyard until the consul came down and asked him his name.</p> <p>In a war from which nothing but dispiriting news was coming back, Churchill\u2019s \u201cdaring\u201d escape was a gift for the London newspapers. They were full of \u201cMr Churchill\u2019s heroism\u201d, of the \u201cgallantry\u201d, \u201ccoolness and pluck\u201d of this \u201cyoung man of brilliant promise\u201d. The following year he stood again for parliament and won his seat. He said \u201cpersonal popularity arising from out of the late South African war carried me in\u201d. Despite his famous later assertion that surrendering was something the British would never do, it did his own career no harm.</p> <p><em>Hero of the Empire is published by Allen Lane (\u00a320). </em><a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/hero-of-the-empire.html\" title=\"\"><em>Click here to order it for \u00a316.40</em></a></p>",
  "<p>There are only a handful of votes in government-funded infrastructure spending. Labour finance chief John McDonnell might see the sense in boosting the amount spent on roads, rail, fibre-optic cabling, skills training and green energy. Paris-based thinktank <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/21/oecd-does-a-u-turn-over-brexit-warning-as-it-revises-growth-forecast-for-britain\" title=\"\">the OECD is in the same camp</a>, along with the International Monetary Fund; they have both urged the government to push ahead with plans already on the drawing board. And lined up end to end, economists in favour of infrastructure spending would stretch to the moon and back.</p> <p>But the Treasury has held firm. Austerity was a vote-winner in the last election and will be so again in 2020. It\u2019s something <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/23/jim-oneill-resigns-treasury-minister-conservative-whip-theresa-may-tensions\" title=\"\">Jim O\u2019Neill discovered in his time as a treasury minister</a> and it appears to be one of the main reasons the former Goldman Sachs economist resigned on Friday. There is no money for the northern powerhouse \u2013 not unless it is recycled from elsewhere.</p> <p>Long gone are the days when Gordon Brown could slap a penny on national insurance and get a cheer when he promised to spend it on the NHS. Respondents to Ipsos Mori surveys show the health service dividend is largely spent, leaving voters split three ways in their views on what do about meeting growing demand.</p> <p>A third say the answer is rationing, by which they mean excluding smokers and other groups from some treatments. A third say extra funds should come from efficiency savings. Only a final third support extra taxes.</p> <p>Ipsos Mori polling shows that there are some discrete areas of spending that voters will sanction, in particular on housing. But this support is offset by a clear drift towards nimbyism that divides the pro-investment group from the anti and can be seen in planning disputes across the country.</p> <p>It is in this context that the Treasury under George Osborne, and now Philip Hammond, has remained firmly of the view that there is little public appetite for multibillion-pound projects funded by either higher taxation or with borrowed money that might push the national debt higher.</p> <p>And the pressure on Hammond to keep a tight rein will only have intensified ahead of the autumn statement, after public debt figures for August showed government borrowing heading for a bigger deficit than planned.</p> <p>Not that ministers are immune to extra spending because they have an in-built ideological resistance to it, though some on the free-market fringes of the Tory party do. They resist the temptation to give the go-ahead because a public majority backs low taxation and bare-bones services.</p> <p>Crucially, people across the political spectrum have swallowed a line about extra spending being a burden on the young, which makes every protest at borrowing to build new schools and hospitals feel virtuous. Higher borrowing now is not paid by today\u2019s taxpayers, but tomorrow\u2019s, they say.</p> <p>Comments last year by the new trade minister, Liam Fox, sum up the sentiment: \u201cWe must continue and, if possible, accelerate fiscal consolidation. It is quite unacceptable that the debts of a more affluent generation should be landed on a less affluent one.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Delaying infrastructure spending until such time as the government has a surplus is only to punish the young</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>This phrase was repeated by countless ministers, having had its origins in what was regarded as the most effective poster used by the Tory party at the 2010 election. It depicted a newborn baby under the headline: \u201c<a href=\"http://conservativehome.blogs.com/torydiary/2009/01/dads-nose-mums.html\" title=\"\">Dad\u2019s nose, Mum\u2019s eyes, Gordon Brown\u2019s debts.\u201d</a></p> <p>Earlier this year, Osborne was still pushing the same buttons, hailing his March budget as \u201cputting the next generation first\u201d, before outlining another \u00a312bn of welfare cuts and the target of a budget surplus in 2020.</p> <p>These are arguments that must be confronted. Not that it will be easy; the worse than expected finances will restrict Hammond\u2019s room for manoeuvre. Nevertheless, telling well-off baby boomers that constructing sophisticated infrastructure at the earliest opportunity provides young people with jobs, better health outcomes and a better standard of living is essential. Delaying the same infrastructure spending until such time as the government has a surplus is only to punish the young, leaving them to play catch-up with other countries\u2019 industrial, digital and healthcare investments.</p> <p>When Larry Fink, the chief executive and chairman of the world\u2019s largest fund manager, BlackRock \u2013 it manages $4.4tn of investments \u2013 says that chief executives on both sides of the Atlantic tell him there is no reason to invest at the moment, you know the private sector will not be the answer.</p> <p>Labour\u2019s answer is, in part, to tax. But there is no appetite for paying higher taxes either.</p> <p>That leaves borrowing, which is not such a scary prospect when international investors are prepared to lend money at rock-bottom rates. It can look like a gamble to borrow to build a road, cycleway, train link or skills academy that provides secondary effects for the private sector. But when the effective interest rate is below 1%, the economy only needs to grow modestly on the back of these developments to make the borrowing pay for itself.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/18/labour-vows-to-set-up-national-investment-bank-to-mobilise-500bn\" title=\"\">McDonnell proposes a \u00a3500bn national investment bank</a>. What he fails to recognise is that the argument is still in the proverbial basement, waiting to emerge on the ground floor. As such, he hasn\u2019t even made the case for government to regain control before he\u2019s blown \u00a3500bn. There is much more work to do before any kind of state-sponsored bank can spend even a fiver.</p>",
  "<p>When I was 24 and still had a waist, a lot of incredibly wealthy men would chase me around. One of these men saw me in London and invited me to have dinner with him in Paris. So I did what any 24-year-old would do: I said yes.</p> <p>The next day he sent his private Learjet to pick me up and flew me over. He owned Perrier, so he was fabulously wealthy. He wined and dined me and was clearly trying to get into my pants, but I wouldn\u2019t give it up. Finally he said: \u201cI\u2019ll give you anything you want.\u201d And I said: \u201cA ticket home!\u201d So the next morning, true to his word, he arranged for the jet to take me back to London.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>On the jet we talked about how our friend had made a move on me</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I was sitting in the jet and the stewardess offered champagne. Then I saw this other woman on the plane. She was slightly older, but was immaculately dressed and poised on the edge of her seat. She was wearing a very tailored black suit with a stunning gold brooch. Very elegant. She looked at me and said: \u201c<em>Bonjour, comment t\u2019appelle tu</em>?\u201d \u201c<em>Bonjour</em>,\u201d I said. \u201c<em>Je m\u2019appelle Laurence</em>. <em>Et vous, madame</em>?\u201d And she said: \u201c<em>Coco. Coco Chanel</em>.\u201d</p> <p>So we spent the flight back to London exchanging stories and talking about how our mutual friend had tried to make a move on me. She remained very calm and just laughed and said: \u201cAh Gussy, that is his way.\u201d</p> <p>She asked me which hotel Gussy had put me in. I said: \u201cDe Crillon.\u201d And where did you dine, she asked? \u201cMaxim\u2019s de Paris.\u201d I went on to ask her if she liked London and she said: \u201cOf course.\u201d And where do you dine when in London, I asked? She said, \u201cThe Savoy, Prunier and L\u2019Escargot.\u201d</p> <p>She wanted to know more about my upbringing as she was clearly still slightly intrigued to see a 24-year-old joining her on this trip back to London, so I talked about my background and education. I told her I came from Liverpool in the north of England and went to the same school as the Beatles and regularly fought with George Harrison in the playground. I was surprised she knew all about them.</p> <p>I then went on to tell her that I\u2019d gone to the London School of Economics when I was 17 with Mick Jagger, by which she was less impressed. She asked about other cities I had visited. \u201cYoung man,\u201d she said: \u201c<em>C\u2019est la vie</em>.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"9d6876320166e358fea9ff7c9040083571a561c8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9d6876320166e358fea9ff7c9040083571a561c8/551_119_914_914/500.jpg\" alt=\"Head and shoulders of Laurence Isaacson, smiling\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><em>Laurence Isaacson is a co-owner of L\u2019Escargot.

Meal for two, including drinks and service: \u00a340-\u00a3110</strong></p> <p>At times the dedicated restaurant-goer must behave like an intelligence analyst; must become the George Smiley of the table, forever sifting through drifts of information in search of reliable leads. You must filter out the blurring white noise of those who are paid to hustle through the agency of free meals. You must weigh the knowledge for chronic ignorance or plain stupidity or both. Use of words like \u201cmouth\u201d and \u201cwatering\u201d are a giveaway.</p> <p>Never is this more so than with Japanese restaurants serving sushi. Because the good stuff is such a bespoke operation \u2013 if you find a sushi place with more than 20 seats, shake your head sagely and move on \u2013 they tend to occupy a quiet spot in the hungry conversation. A restaurant with, say, nine seats doesn\u2019t need to make that much noise to fill them, as long as they are good.</p> <p>I keep being told of a tiny restaurant in the suburbs of a Midland\u2019s town, established because of a nearby car plant full of Japanese salarymen who need their fix, that deserves my attention. I hear whispers of airing-cupboard-sized places in the south London suburbs with a blond-wood bar that seats just six. I\u2019m told that\u2019s where the serious raw fish action is. But it\u2019s hard to be sure. At the top end of sushi, at the place where the most perfectly fashioned and wielded knife meets the most perfectly sourced and kept fish, the difference between \u201cMeh!\u201d and \u201cOh My!\u201d can seem so very slight.

Unfortunately, I\u2019m a journalist; giving away secrets is my job. Four years ago, when it first opened, it would have been reasonable to assume Umezushi\u2019s site was chosen specifically to avoid attention or, indeed, custom of any kind. It occupies a tight railway arch down below Manchester Victoria station. Mirabel Street is a pretty name for a bit of industrial rough trade, all grimy blackened brick and knackered lock-up. It\u2019s a crime scene waiting to happen.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The wakame has a huge savoury-sour whack from the festering place on the beach where sea meets sand</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But the centre of Manchester continues to expand and now it\u2019s starting to look like an inspired choice. The city has wandered down to Umezushi. Inside it\u2019s all deeply varnished blond wood and calm. There is table seating for 10 with space for another four at a counter before an open kitchen. Apparently it\u2019s owned by a chap from Taiwan. The cooks are from Korea and, on the day we were there, Spain and the Czech Republic. The skills, they told me, have been learned here on the job. This makes sense. The Czech Republic is not hugely famous for its sushi traditions.</p> <p>At this point I should define terms. This is not the very finest sushi in the land, but it really is very good indeed and, at the price, a bit of a miracle. We asked them to throw everything they had at us and received a bill for \u00a3110 for two. You could eat very well for half that. Nigiri sushi is around \u00a34 per two pieces, with a large sushi set at \u00a323.50. Or there\u2019s an express lunch for around a tenner a head. The good signs start with their own sweet-sour pickled ginger, which is not Barbie pink. It is a healthy oatmeal colour, with the tattered, fibrous edges of the home-sliced stuff. There are crunchy pieces of pickled radish. There\u2019s a tight knot of slippery wakame with a huge savoury-sour whack from the festering place on the beach where sea meets sand.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f691cb9f9408896f639b7c41488efe4b6f83092a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f691cb9f9408896f639b7c41488efe4b6f83092a/0_188_5632_3380/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018With staring eye and jaw\u2019: roasted salmon head.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018With staring eye and jaw\u2019: roasted salmon head.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Thomond for The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Most importantly, there is the rice, which is lightly vinagered and served just warm enough to let the flavours play out. The grains hold together without being mush. I was once told that sushi is really all about the rice. It\u2019s not all about the rice, but the rice is bloody important. Somebody here has given the matter their attention.</p> <p>We begin with sashimi, including neatly cut pieces of sweet scallop and tuna, laid prettily across shredded mooli. Next the first of the nigiri, the best of which is scorched sea bream, the hastily applied heat encouraging the lubricious oils to run. A dainty pile of tobiko \u2013 micro fish roe \u2013 gives a hit of salt and sea. There is salmon and more tuna, each decorated with micro herbs which indicate somebody cares about looks. There\u2019s glazed and grilled eel, still warm to the touch. It\u2019s a punctuation mark of caramel flavours against the subtlety of the others. Slices of wagyu, sensitively flamed, almost justify the \u00a310 price tag that accompanies eating the Audrey Hepburn of steak. It is a cheerful, buttery hit of dribbling animal fat.</p> <p>A king prawn hand-roll disappoints. The prawn is a sizeable beast, but it\u2019s wrapped in enough rice to re-sculpt Devil\u2019s Tower from <em>Close Encounters of the Third Kind</em>. California rolls of crab are a little moist in the centre, but good all the same. The specials board offers roasted salmon head and hake collar. We order both and watch as, between tending to our raw fish needs, they turn the cuts over hot coals until the skin is blistered and the flesh underneath has steamed in its own moisture.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0eb1283cdd87e03848437b0d2543d232c1c6becf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0eb1283cdd87e03848437b0d2543d232c1c6becf/471_591_4721_2833/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018The very thing for cheap lunches when winter comes\u2019: Taiwanese pork rice.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018The very thing for cheap lunches when winter comes\u2019: Taiwanese pork rice.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Thomond for The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The fish arrive on the plate looking like themselves: here, half a salmon head with staring eye and jaw; there, the collar of a hake with the curving bits of cartilage just before the gills. It\u2019s a lesson in waste management \u2013 don\u2019t throw anything away. They also tell us that the good stuff may require a little more work to get to. We pull at the sweet pearly flesh of the hake with our fingers; scrape along the curve of the salmon jaw with the pad of one thumb to pull away the treasures. These are the rarely explored regions of the fish that work the hardest, hence they taste the best. The skin is crisp and salty and releases its oils obligingly.</p> <p>The express lunch menu includes a dish of Taiwanese braised belly pork across rice, also available as a small side. It is a big, sticky bowl of sweet, salty, sticky pig and will be the very thing for cheap lunches when winter comes. It is truly well-sauced pork. You get the message by now.

And what happened is also in the diaries of Cook and others including Joseph Banks [the botanist aboard Endeavour],\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cWhat I\u2019m pushing for is not a loan, not just a permanent loan. The shield has got to stay in a museum in Sydney \u2013 that\u2019s the only place for it \u2013 then it\u2019s up to the elders of the Gweagal people what goes on with it, how the history relating to it is used for our people and other Australians.</p> <p>\u201cThe tour is to tell the story, to highlight the events of first contact, to highlight how the artefacts were taken, to highlight how it was wrong and how it is wrong for them not to give them back to us.\u201d</p> <p>The shield bears an obvious hole. Botanist Joseph Banks, a witness from Cook\u2019s HMS Endeavour when it sailed into Kamay (Botany Bay) on 29 April 1770, later wrote in his journal that the hole came from a \u201csingle pointed lance\u201d.

In 1978 he screened films about Indigenous Australia at the Cannes film festival and the next year he established the Aboriginal Information Centre in London. </p> <p>Significantly, Foley senior was at the centre of a controversy in 2004 involving the seizure by the Dja Dja Wurrung people of central Victoria of bark artefacts that were on loan from the British Museum to the Melbourne Museum (now Museum Victoria) where he was then working. He supported the seizure of the bark artefacts under the federal Aboriginal Cultural Heritage Act by a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/postcolonial-blog/2015/feb/14/it-taunts-us-spiritually-the-fight-for-indigenous-relics-spirited-off-to-the-uk\">Dja Dja Wurrung elder and fellow activist, Gary Murray</a>. </p> <p>After a protracted court case, the barks were returned to the British Museum. Several of the barks \u2013 together with the Gweagal shield \u2013 came back to Australia briefly for the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/feb/10/battle-for-bark-art-indigenous-leaders-hail-breakthrough-in-talks-with-british-museum\">National Museum of Australia exhibition, Encounters</a>. </p> <p>Murray and Foley have been in discussions with the British Museum over their insistence the barks return permanently to the Dja Dja Wurring. They have dealt extensively with Gaye Sculthorpe, an Indigenous Tasmanian who has, since 2013, been curator of the museum\u2019s Oceania and Australia collection.</p> <p>Kelly and the Gweagal are now corresponding with and talking to Sculthorpe regarding their claim on the shield.</p> <p>It was on 28 March, during the final hour of the Encounters exhibition, that Rodney Kelly made a statement of claim on behalf of the Gweagal for the return of the shield and the spears.</p> <p>\u201cIt is a matter of fact the shield held in the collection of the British Museum and currently on display at the National Museum of Australia ... was in fact stolen from our ancestor, the warrior Cooman of the tribe Gweagal upon first encounter with James Cook and the crew of the Endeavour in 1770 at Kamay Bay which is the original name for land now known as Botany Bay,\u201d Kelly said in a statement of claim, which he <a href=\"http://www.begadistrictnews.com.au/story/3916943/shielded-from-the-truth/\">read at the museum to the applause of some museum staff</a>. </p> <p>\u201cIt is our will and the will of the clan that all Gweagal artefacts are kept on Gweagal Country and do not leave the shores of Australia under any circumstances whatsoever without express permission from the elders of the Gweagal Tribe. All artefacts currently held by the British Museum and National Museum of Australia are to be returned within 90 days of this letter.\u201d</p> <p>On 20 April 2016, the museum\u2019s deputy director, Jonathan Williams, responded to Kelly: \u201cI understand from Gaye [Sculthorpe] that your aspiration is to have the shield publicly displayed in Australia and for it to be used for educational purposes. As Gaye mentioned, the Museum often lends objects around the world and is open to the possibility of lending the shield to Australia again.</p> <p>\u201cAll decisions regarding the loan of objects for the collections are made by our trustees taking into account normal considerations of security, environment and so on. For a further loan to Australia there would need to be a host institution that meets the loan conditions which is acceptable to all parties.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/nov/27/encounters-exhibition-a-stunning-but-troubling-collection-of-colonial-plunder\">Encounters exhibition: a stunning but troubling collection of colonial plunder</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It was a bitter irony that the Gweagal shield \u2013 and all other artefacts from the collection that were displayed in Encounters \u2013 were rendered legally immune under Australian Commonwealth law from Indigenous claim by the <a href=\"https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2013A00012\">2013 Protection of Cultural Objects on Loan Act</a>. </p> <p>The act was legislated precisely to prevent a repeat of the seizure by Murray (supported by Foley senior) of the Dja Dja Wurrung barks from the British Museum collection on loan to the Melbourne Museum in 2004.</p> <p>The quest to have the Gweagal shield and spears returned, does, however, appear to be winning ever greater mainstream political support that has been absent from the efforts of Foley senior, Murray and others before them.</p> <p>In August the New South Wales parliament passed a bipartisan motion <a href=\"https://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/lc/papers/runningrecord/Documents/2016/Notices%2023%20June%202016.pdf\">acknowledging Gweagal ownership of the artefacts and urging their repatriation</a>. </p> <p>On 10 October the federal Greens senator Rachel Siewert will <a href=\"http://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Chamber_documents/Senate_chamber_documents/Notice_Paper/Current_Notice_Paper\">move a similar motion in the Senate</a>, with an additional call for the federal government to lend Kelly and his delegation diplomatic support in their quest to have the shield repatriated.</p> <p>Sitting beneath the gum trees at the Aboriginal embassy this week, in the shadows of the monolithic statue of King George V, Roxley Foley spoke of the imperative to Indigenous Australians of repatriating the first contact Gweagal artefacts.

Activist groups said more than 50 bodies had been found since midnight on Friday alone. One warned that \u201cpeople now don\u2019t think they will live to see another day\u201d.</p> <p>The munitions used appear to include extremely powerful \u201cbunker buster\u201d bombs that can bring down whole buildings. They make death tolls harder to calculate because they destroy some bodies entirely and leave others too deeply buried in rubble for recovery.</p> <p>The airstrikes have also targeted the headquarters of the city\u2019s famous civilian \u201cwhite helmets\u201d, who risk their lives to dig survivors from the rubble of bombed buildings. The strikes meant they had fewer men and resources to respond to other attacks, with only two fire engines left, while fuel shortages and roads blocked by rubble are slowing ambulances.</p> <p>\u201cOur teams are responding, but are not enough to cover this amount of catastrophe,\u201d Ammar al-Selmo, head of the civil defence rescue service in the opposition-held east, told Reuters from Aleppo.</p> <p>Doctors are struggling to triage the injuries brought into the few remaining hospitals, with medical supplies running out. There are also fears that epidemics could take hold, after water supplies were cut to both sides of the city.</p> <p>Airstrikes damaged the Bab al-Nayrab pumping station which provides eastern Aleppo with water, and the intensity of attacks meant repair teams could not reach it, the UN said. In retaliation, another nearby station Suleiman al-Halabi \u2013 which supplies more than 1.5 million people in government-held western Aleppo \u2013 was switched off.</p> <p>\u201cDepriving children of water puts them at risk of catastrophic outbreaks of waterborne diseases and adds to the suffering, fear and horror that children in Aleppo live through every day,\u201d Hanaa Singer, the representative of the children\u2019s agency, Unicef in Syria, said. \u201cIt is critical for children\u2019s survival that all parties in the conflict stop attacks on water infrastructure.\u201d</p> <p>In the west of the city, some deep wells can provide water, but in east Aleppo most of the well water is contaminated. The charity plans to truck water throughout the city, but warned this is a temporary and inadequate solution.</p> <p>The US secretary of state, John Kerry, said he had made \u201ca little progress\u201d on halting the violence in talks with the Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov. But the Russians said there was little to suggest any forward movement, so Aleppo\u2019s misery looks set to continue.</p> <p>Assad is determined to regain control of a city that has become a symbol and a strategic prize for both sides. But, despite the intense bombing, it is unlikely to fall quickly. A large, defiant population remains in rebel-held areas, and they are afraid of the retribution of government forces should they succeed in capturing the city.</p> <p>\u201cIt seems highly improbable that there will be a quick defeat of eastern Aleppo,\u201d one western diplomat told journalists in New York. \u201cThe only way to take it is by such monstrous atrocities that it would resonate for generations.\u201d</p>",

She said doctors had told her family he was braindead and would not wake up from the incident.</p> <p>Several guards were also injured in the incident, including two who suffered facial fractures.</p> <p>Rule said she planned a series of national protests and would fight for justice for her brother.</p> <p>\u201cThis is not just another death in custody, this is state sanctioned brutality in the same stream as <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/blacklivesmatter?source=feed_text&amp;story_id=1100208100069668\">#blacklivesmatter</a> and deserves the same level of attention.

Rule said he was due to be released into home custody.</p> <p>Morrison\u2019s brother, Patrick, condemned South Australia\u2019s Department for Correctional Services over the incident.</p> <p>\u201cMy brother is going to die because of what they\u2019ve done to him,\u201d he wrote on Facebook.</p> <p>\u201cThere will be justice, I demand justice. You cannot hide what you\u2019ve done.\u201d <br></p> <p>Wayne Morrison was waiting in the admissions area of Yatala prison ahead of a scheduled video-link appearance at Elizabeth magistrates court when the \u201ccritical incident\u201d erupted at about 11:30am Friday.</p> <p>Authorities allege Morrison was involved in an altercation with two officers, including a young woman, when he had to be restrained by three other guards.</p> <p>It is understood Morrison was then taken back to G division of the prison, Yatala\u2019s maximum security area, when he suffered a medical episode, believed to be a cardiac arrest.</p> <p>The correctional services department chief executive, David Brown, <a href=\"http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/news/national/prisoner-critical-and-five-guards-injured-during-critical-incident-at-adelaides-yatala-prison/news-story/03aaded5ddddb90326724c33acde3a9d\">told the Sunday Mail in Adelaide</a> the \u201ccritical incident\u201d involved an alleged assault by an inmate on prison staff.</p> <p>\u201cThe prisoner involved in the incident was brought under control by responding staff,\u201d Brown said. \u201cIn the course of the incident, a medical emergency ensued and the correctional staff applied immediate first aid to the prisoner and sought assistance from onsite medical staff.\u201d<br></p> <p>Five staff were injured.
