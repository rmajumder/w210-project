He cited the fact only three entities had been prosecuted for importing asbestos since 2003 and fined the \u201cpitiful\u201d amount of $300,000 in total.</p> <p>\u201cThat would do little to deter a company like Yuanda that had revenue of $217m last financial year,\u201d the peak body said in its letter.</p> <p>\u201cWe want an investigation into why the current regime is failing so badly,\u201d Borowick said.<br></p> <p>Immigration minister, Peter Dutton, has previously blamed the problem on the logistical impossibility of checking every container that enters Australia.</p> <p>A spokeswoman for the immigration department confirmed there had been three successful prosecutions \u201cin recent years\u201d. She said an increased focus on asbestos by the Australian Border Force had resulted in 13 discoveries of asbestos-contaminated goods in the last year.</p> <p>\u201cBorder Force does not rely on prosecutions alone to ensure better compliance outcomes,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Other enforcement problems identified by the ACTU include that building materials come from countries with \u201cunreliable or flawed standards\u201d including that some foreign regulators allow low levels of asbestos in their products. The union body claims Chinese products can be labelled \u201casbestos-free\u201d while still containing as much as 5% asbestos.</p> <p>The ACTU said government reviews of the problem including <a href=\"https://www.border.gov.au/ReportsandPublications/Documents/reviews-and-inquiries/asbestos-importation-review.pdf\">the March 2016 asbestos importation review</a> were inadequate. </p> <p>That report found \u201cthe asbestos border control is effective\u201d but recommended the government should \u201cmaximise targeting of high-risk goods\u201d and \u201cfurther prioritise investigation to improve prosecution of offences related to asbestos importation\u201d.<br></p> <p>Borowick said unions and asbestos groups were not consulted and the report did not consider changes to the Customs Act.</p> <p>Labor promised an asbestos importation Senate inquiry before the election, and the Senate will consider establishing it as part of the building products inquiry at its next sitting on 10 October.</p> <p>Labor\u2019s employment spokesman, Brendan O\u2019Connor, said an inquiry was needed \u201cto ensure a proper total ban on asbestos is enforced\u201d.</p> <p>After the <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-08-24/port-pirie-smelter-redevelopment-asbestos-scare/7780320\">discovery of asbestos</a> in equipment used in the Port Pirie smelter redevelopment in August Nick Xenophon said: \u201cThere is absolutely no excuse for deadly asbestos to be coming into this country.</p> <p>\u201cClearly the current system of border protection, enforcement, and compliance has not worked.\u201d</p> <p>Xenophon helped establish the non-conforming building products inquiry and supports a separate inquiry or term of reference to consider asbestos importation under the current one.</p> <p>He said it should consider requiring all new building products coming into the country that have the potential to contain asbestos to be independently checked and certified.</p> <p>Borowick said defences to asbestos importation offences needed to be considered, because companies importing the material were allowed to take assurances products did not contain asbestos at face value and escape prosecution. He also suggested liability for the head contractor on building projects should be considered when companies they engage imported asbestos.</p> <p>Greens immigration spokesman, Nick McKim, told Guardian Australia: \u201cStopping the importation of illegal, asbestos-ridden materials requires a concerted effort, and a Senate inquiry could be a useful way to reveal the scale of the problem and propose solutions.\u201d</p> <p> Hanson said: \u201cIf the government don\u2019t do a total ban [of asbestos building products] they\u2019re failing their duty of care.

Therein lies the rub.<br></p> <h2>What\u2019s the big deal?</h2> <p>This definition is being fought over because it will set the parameters for superannuation policy into the future.</p> <p>The Coalition says it will provide stability to the system and <a href=\"http://treasury.gov.au/SuperReforms\">measure whether policies are meeting the objective</a>. But, in political terms, this yardstick can also be the blunt instrument with which to beat government.</p> <p>With a broad objective, for example, opponents of any reform may argue that tax concessions are, variously, too generous or too stingy, depending on their point of view. </p> <p>While the Coalition party room has agreed on the wider policy to put to parliament, the argument outside the building is about its scope as government considers an ageing population.</p> <p><a href=\"http://grattan.edu.au/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/876-A-better-super-system.pdf\">A recent Grattan Institute report</a> outlined its importance in dollar terms.</p> <p>\u201cIf the objective of super is to provide retirement income to substitute for or supplement the age pension, then the system should avoid supporting those whose wealth makes them unlikely to receive even a part age pension,\u201d the authors wrote.</p> <p>\u201cYet current superannuation tax breaks often go well beyond this purpose and their costs are unsustainable. The tax breaks reduce income tax collections by more than $25bn a year. </p> <p>\u201cMore than half the benefits flow to the wealthiest 20% of households who already have enough resources to fund their own retirement, and whose savings choices aren\u2019t affected much by tax rates. The current system is expensive and unfair.\u201d</p> <h2>Dignity and comfort</h2> <p>Matt Linden of Industry Super Australia, which represents about 5.5m workers or about half Australia\u2019s workforce, favours enshrining a reference to a living standard outcome into the objective.<br></p> <p>For example, superannuation could be \u201cto enable all Australians to live a dignified and comfortable retirement by providing income to supplement or substitute the pension\u201d. </p> <p>\u201cThe objective needs to be given some meaning and a stronger vision as to what the community expects the system to deliver,\u201d Linden says. </p> <p>\u201cThe system was established to deliver more than the age pension alone could provide and certainly sufficient income for older Australians to meet their living costs and enjoy some activities that keep them healthy, active and engaged with their families and communities. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2016/sep/17/jobless-rate-offers-coalition-a-chance-to-brag-so-why-has-it-barely-had-a-mention\">Jobless rate offers Coalition a chance to brag, so why has it barely had a mention? | Greg Jericho</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cAfter a lifetime working this is not too much to expect and certainly something a country like ours should be able to deliver.</p> <h2>Super as a social goal</h2> <p>The Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia\u2019s interim chief executive, Jim Minto, says while the current objective recognises the superannuation system must provide income to retirees in conjunction with the aged pension, it is silent on the social goal of super.</p> <p>\u201cAchieving a comfortable standard of living in retirement is the aspiration of all Australians and the objective should support that aspiration,\u201d Minto said.</p> <p>\u201cWe believe it must also articulate the social goal of the system to maximise the number of Australians living in comfort and dignity in retirement.</p> <p>\u201cThese are the key elements currently missing and they are essential to ensure the superannuation system delivers on its promise to members.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.smsfoa.org.au/images/Advocacy/160406-SMSF-Owners-Alliance-Objectives-Submission.pdf\">The SMSF Owners\u2019 Alliance</a> believes the objective should be tied to pre-retirement lifestyle. That is, that people should be given the opportunity to fund<strong> \u201c</strong>an income in retirement that allows them to maintain to a reasonable degree their living standard after retirement\u201d.</p> <p>So whether the objective is to achieve a \u201cdignified and comfortable\u201d or a proportion of your working-life income, how much is enough? Is \u201cdignified and comfortable\u201d income just a tad above a pension rates? Or is \u201cdignified and comfortable\u201d living on a proportion of your former income, whether you are a banker or a bus driver?</p> <h2>A retirement standard for a standard retirement</h2> <p>As nebulous as it sounds, there are \u201caccepted\u201d industry standards measured by ASFA that benchmarks a budget for both a <a href=\"http://www.superannuation.asn.au/resources/retirement-standard\">modest or a comfortable retirement lifestyle</a>, assuming<strong> </strong>retirees own their own home outright and are relatively healthy.<strong> </strong></p> <p>\u201cA modest retirement lifestyle is considered better than the age pension but still only able to afford fairly basic activities,\u201d ASFA advises.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/15/superannuation-backflip-on-500000-cap-wins-over-coalition-conservatives\">Superannuation backflip on $500,000 cap wins over Coalition conservatives</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cA comfortable retirement lifestyle enables an older, healthy retiree to be involved in a broad range of leisure and recreational activities and to have a good standard of living through the purchase of such things as; household goods, private health insurance, a reasonable car, good clothes, a range of electronic equipment and domestic and occasionally international holiday travel.\u201d</p> <p>The ASFA website advices the budget needed for a healthy 65-year-old with a \u201cmodest\u201d lifestyle is $23,767 for singles and $34,216 for couples. For those on a \u201ccomfortable\u201d lifestyle, the budget required is $43,062 for singles and $59,160 for couples.</p> <p>Is that adequate? </p> <h2>Superannuation moves on</h2> <p>All of these questions are currently before the government after a very short nine-day consultation period on the objective of superannuation. In the meantime, I received a comment on a superannuation story which had a common complaint.</p> <p>\u201cIncome tax was introduced in this country on the promise that, if common people paid it, the government would look after them when their working life ended \u2013 a liveable pension,\u201d the writer said. </p> <p>\u201cNow, this fundamental concept is being eroded away, so that by the time our kids retire they will have paid taxes all their lives and not get ONE PENNY back from a drastically shrunken government that is no longer of or even for the people.\u201d</p> <p>While it is still a deeply held view in older generations, some suggest it stemmed from the postwar period where a tax surcharge was hypothecated for the National Welfare Fund, designed to provide aged pensions, unemployment benefits and other payments. Eventually the fund was rolled into general government payments and the levy was absorbed into income tax rates. But the view remains.</p> <p>The purpose of changing the superannuation objective is to change that view and rewrite the expectations to consider the aged pension a safety net rather than an entitlement. As benign as the objective sounds, it will frame superannuation policy into the future and that is why it is worth watching. <br></p>",
  "<p>The concept of the \u201cdesignated survivor\u201d \u2013 one member of the president\u2019s staff who sits out of the State of the Union in case the rest of the government is blown to bits \u2013 is one that is so delicious that it seems impossible it hasn\u2019t been made into a movie yet. This designated survivor is something that actually happens, but the closest we\u2019ve had from Hollywood is Dave, a movie where the president\u2019s likeness steps in for him unbeknownst to the people so that he can pretend to be president. Creator David Guggenheim (the writer of action movies Safe House and Taken) finally deployed this bit of civics trivia and whipped it up into ABC\u2019s much-hyped new drama. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/sep/19/best-tv-week-fall-premieres-this-is-us-lethal-weapon-macgyver\">Best TV of the week: fall series premieres are finally upon us</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The popular narrative about what would happen if an ordinary guy suddenly became president is an intoxicating one because it makes the audience question what they would do if they were in charge of the nation in a time of crisis. That\u2019s exactly what happens to Adam Kirkman (Kiefer Sutherland, in his second role where he\u2019s in charge of the nuclear football), the housing and urban development secretary who was sitting in his Cornell sweatshirt and comfy pants at a secure location when the Capitol is engulfed by a fireball killing every member of all three branches of government simultaneously. Before he can even finish his popcorn, he\u2019s being sworn in. </p> <p>Kirkman is shuttled into a bunker underneath the White House and is quickly joined by his wife, Alex (Natasha McElhone), and young daughter Penny (Mckenna Grace), but his son Leo (Tanner Buchanan) is missing. Kirkman doesn\u2019t have time for family problems because his former boss\u2019s deputy chief of staff, the lantern-jawed Captain American type Aaron Shore (Adan Canto), is trying to seize control of what little remains of the government. </p> <p>There is one scene, right after Kirkman is sworn in, when he goes to the marble-festooned restroom in his bunker and vomits from anxiety. It\u2019s the best scene in the pilot and it infuses the audience with the same doubts as Kirkman, wondering how the heck is he \u2013 or the country for that matter \u2013 going to get out of this mess. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_f1v0Nx5Sw\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/N_f1v0Nx5Sw?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Apparently the answer is optimism and meaningless platitudes. There is a lot of the \u201cwe\u2019re going to do this my way\u201d talk of a less successful action movie and the \u201cI\u2019m about as straight of a shooter as you\u2019re going to find in Washington\u201d talk out of a cut-rate West Wing. At one point Kirkman\u2019s new chief staff writer (former IRL White House employee Kal Penn) actually says: \u201cMr President, you need to be stronger than you\u2019ve ever been right now. We need that.\u201d That might be what the country needs, but this drama needs dialogue that won\u2019t make the citizenry\u2019s eyeballs roll. </p> <p> What\u2019s sad is that this idea launches us into a totally unknown and unexplored world. How is a new Congress going to be elected? Does this president now get to appoint all 12 supreme court justices? Won\u2019t the American people be freaking out and rioting? How will this all work? The pilot is not as concerned with any of these questions. Instead we get the unsure Kirkman seizing the reins after overhearing his kids in the Lincoln bedroom talking about how \u201cdaddy isn\u2019t afraid of anything\u201d, like we\u2019re in a lesser Jim Carrey movie and the political unity of the world isn\u2019t at stake. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/sep/21/lethal-weapon-remake-loud-ludicrous-loveable\">Lethal Weapon remake: loud, ludicrous and lovable</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There is the question of who perpetrated the bombing and no terrorist groups or other nations are taking credit.

There\u2019s not enough family tension for it to be a domestic drama, not enough government intrigue to make it a political show, and not enough investigation to make it a procedural. The idea of what would happen if an average citizen were to take over the country is one worth exploring (particularly because it might be our fate come November), but Designated Survivor isn\u2019t quite up to the task.

  "<p>The passion and drama of Jos\u00e9 Mourinho\u2019s first meeting in English football with Pep Guardiola continues to feel fresh.

Now, the game is afoot once more.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/21/efl-cup-fourth-round-draw-manchester-united-manchester-city\">EFL Cup draw: Manchester United face Manchester City, Liverpool host Spurs</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The EFL Cup fourth round will be headlined by United\u2019s tie against City at Old Trafford, after both clubs smoothed their passage into it with away victories. City got the job done <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/21/swansea-city-manchester-city-efl-cup-match-report\" title=\"\">at Swansea City</a> and Mourinho\u2019s team were too strong for Northampton Town, albeit after a performance that contained its share of imperfections.</p> <p>Mourinho was prickly afterwards, which was not entirely surprising, given how United had wobbled towards the end of the first half and the manner in which they had laboured for penetration until the introduction of Marcus Rashford and Zlatan Ibrahimovic in the 54th minute. It was all a bit Louis van Gaal.</p> <p>But his target was a surprise. Mourinho chose to highlight Jak McCourt\u2019s scything tackle through the back of Memphis Depay in the 47th minute, for which the Northampton midfielder was booked. It provoked a sulky monologue from the Portuguese, which was underpinned by the hint of conspiracy. \u201cNormally, it is easier against 10 men and we should have been playing against 10 men very early in the second half,\u201d Mourinho said.</p> <p>Northampton had equalised Michael Carrick\u2019s opening goal through Alex Revell\u2019s penalty, which was awarded after Daley Blind had nibbled at Sam Hoskins, and Mourinho was asked whether he thought the decision had been correct. \u201cI think I should stop to speak about referees\u2019 decisions,\u201d Mourinho said. \u201cAnd I think I should just be waiting for you to speak about them with honest visions and with the dishonest visions. I told about the red card [for Northampton] because it was really a dangerous situation.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not speaking about the penalty against Man City [not given to Wayne Rooney after Claudio Bravo\u2019s tackle]. I am speaking about the situation where we could have had an important injury and even in this situation ... \u201d He tailed off. \u201cI should stop and leave it with you,\u201d he said. \u201cSome honest, some dishonest.\u201d</p> <p>His body language during the game and his words in a flash interview with Sky Sports after it \u2013 which he gave before the City draw had been made \u2013 betrayed a man with frustrations and grievances. He did not speak to the press and so we will have to wait for his reaction to the next Manchester derby.He had arrived in Northampton against a backdrop of dissatisfaction. After the City loss had come two more against <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/15/feyenoord-manchester-united-europa-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Feyenoord</a> in the Europa League and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/18/watford-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Watford </a>and, for only the third time in his managerial career, he was staring at the possibility of a fourth consecutive defeat.</p> <p>Mourinho had openly criticised some of his players, star names had underperformed and confidence was low. Another setback was unthinkable. Mercifully for Mourinho and the club, they found the means to pull out of the nose dive and it owed much to his call for the cavalry.</p> <p>On came Rashford and Ibrahimovic, and United found the extra gear. The crucial second goal was all about the precision and technique of Ander Herrera but Rashford had set up the shooting opportunity for him and it was Rashford himself who scored the clinching third.</p> <p>It said much that Mourinho had to summon two of his big-name attackers in the quest to break down League One opposition and there were other aspects of the evening that would have grated with him. Marcos Rojo failed to inspire confidence at left-back and there were nervous moments for some of the other defenders in the first-half, namely Tim Fosu-Mensah and Blind.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/21/swansea-city-manchester-city-efl-cup-match-report\">Gael Clichy and Aleix Garc\u00eda give Manchester City victory at Swansea</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Further forward, Wayne Rooney ran his socks off to little effect. Mourinho had started him as the No9 in his 4-3-3 formation, in what felt like a show of faith but, twice, the captain strayed offside when well-placed. In the early running, he had shot straight at Northampton\u2019s goalkeeper Adam Smith. Rooney was moved to the right when Ibrahimovic came on and it felt emblematic to see him shunted to the side when the tie was won.</p> <p>On the other hand, United did set the tempo and dominate possession and, in the end, the result was not only all important but comfortable. Carrick made a positive impression on his return to the team for his first action since the Community Shield and Rashford remains the man who can make something happen.</p> <p>Mourinho made nine changes from the Watford defeat \u2013 Rooney and Chris Smalling were the only survivors \u2013 and Paul Pogba was left out of the squad.</p> <p>United went ahead after Smith picked up a backpass and Rooney\u2019s free-kick hit the Northampton wall and then broke to Carrick, who promptly fired a first-time, right-footed shot into the far corner of the net.</p> <p>Fosu-Mensah had headed against the crossbar but he was beaten by Kenji Gorr\u00e9 in the 39th minute, who lashed a shot against the top of the United bar. Herrera had advertised his goal when he hit the post from distance after 59 minutes and Rashford had the final word, after Smith panicked under Herrera\u2019s high ball.</p>",

How Jos\u00e9 Mourinho could do now with a repeat of what happened when these clubs met in the FA Cup 46 years ago, when United won 8-2 thanks to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vq1q0DRNvxc\">a famous double hat-trick by Wayne Rooney</a>. The England striker has been pretty much unmovable since then but an increasingly bloated body of opinion suggests his continued presence in the team is one of the reasons for United\u2019s failure to take off under Mourinho. Only one of the reasons, however, and United were plod against Feyenoord last week, when Rooney didn\u2019t play and they lost the middle match of the three-game losing streak that has triggered some valid criticisms and a lot of insufferable caterwauling. A United victory today might bring a moment of respite before Saturday\u2019s Premier League trip to Leicester. A defeat?<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ah7sWtnOJvQ\"> Lordi help us</a>. </p> <p>Given that Mourinho is likely to deploy many reserves against Northampton, today\u2019s match may not tell us much about how the manager intends to move United forward. But any central midfielder who can demonstrate snappy passing and an ability to conduct rapid attacks may come into the reckoning for the near future. Similarly, there must be places up for grabs in the wide positions given how sluggish United have been there so far this season. On the other hand, if United turn in another lethargic and confused display, then Mourinho may again lament the ability of some players to cope with the pressure while others will wonder about the manager\u2019s ability to uphold a positive atmosphere in the dressing room. Air pollution will soar.</p> <p>What about the home team in all this? Well, they come into this match on the back of a 3-1 loss at Chesterfield but that was their first defeat of a season that has gone reasonably well so far. Despite losing the manager who led them to last season\u2019s League Two title - because Chris Wilder hooked up with his first love, Sheffield United, in the summer - Northampton have been holding their own in League One under new boss Rob Page. They currently stand 11<sup>th</sup> and, what is more, they reached this stage of the League Cup by winning away at Barnsley before beating top-flight West Brom at today\u2019s venue, the Sixfields Stadium. United have been here once before, back in 2004 when they won 3-0 in the FA Cup. Marc Richards, Northampton\u2019s current captain, played in that game and has no doubt told many, many people over the years that the result could have been different if his ferocious 18-yard volley had gone into the net rather than cannoned back off the crossbar when United were only two up. So this match is really all about Richards\u2019 finally getting the chance, at 34, to right a great wrong. All eyes will, of course, be on the team-sheets to see if he starts. let you know the lineups asap. That, then, will be the first thrill of what promises to be a night of high drama. Hopefully. </p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-09-21T17:55:05.283Z\">at 6.55pm BST</time></p>  </div>",

This bus and truck version, directed by <a href=\"http://patriciamcgregor.com/\">Patricia McGregor</a>, cuts the tragedy to under two hours and tours it to prisons, homeless shelters and senior centers before it returns to the Public for a three-week run.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/jun/27/chuk-iwuji-henry-vi-how-we-staged-shakespeare-rsc-cycle-history-plays\">Chuk Iwuji on playing Henry VI: 'There's nothing wimpy about him'</a> </p> </aside>  <p> Iwuji, who will soon return to England to star in <a href=\"https://www.nationaltheatre.org.uk/shows/hedda-gabler\">Hedda Gabler at the National Theatre opposite Ruth Wilson</a>, spoke about how playing Hamlet has changed his craft and maybe his life.</p> <p><strong>How did you become interested in theater?</strong></p> <p>I did theater as a kid in Nigeria. But I didn\u2019t think anything of it. When I moved to boarding school in England, you have the athletes and the non-athletes. And I love sports, I did my rugby and my track, so theater went out the window. But when I found myself heading for law and economics, there was a side of me that quietly panicked. At Yale, I decided to start experimenting with theater again.</p> <p><strong>Do you have a particular affinity for Shakespeare?</strong></p> <p>Yes, I do. As soon as I became an actor and started accidentally doing Shakespeare, it became something that I loved. People seem to believe I know what I\u2019m doing! I have never been worried about who I\u2019m up against when I go in for a Shakespeare audition. I don\u2019t feel intimidated by it, I feel excited by it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d480826649e9fc4d58e9fb70b687acfb5480bfa0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d480826649e9fc4d58e9fb70b687acfb5480bfa0/0_350_1024_614/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Something I\u201dll never experience again\u2019: Chuk Iwuji as Henry VI at the Royal Shakespeare Company in 2006.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Something I\u201dll never experience again\u2019: Chuk Iwuji as Henry VI at the Royal Shakespeare Company in 2006.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Publicity image</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>How did it feel to live with Shakespeare so long when you spent years playing Henry VI for the Royal Shakespeare Company?</strong></p> <p>Unbelievable. It was hard. It was non-stop. We would rehearse something, open it, start rehearsal while we\u2019re running. We had dozens of roles in our head. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2008/mar/19/rsc.theatre\">One Guardian article started by saying she\u2019d interviewed us at the beginning and the end </a>and the first line was, \u201cThey look much older.\u201d Regardless of how tired we were, we knew the immense responsibility that was on our shoulders. We were going to deliver. It was exhilarating, something I\u2019ll never experience again.</p> <p><strong>Does it feel different to play Shakespeare in America?</strong></p> <p>I do feel there is a real reverence for Shakespeare and reverence is a good thing, but it can also be a very dangerous thing. There is sometimes a very thin veil of intimidation that has to be broken through when Shakespeare is being done in this country. And I think Americans like to applaud more. They like to give a standing ovation. </p> <p><strong>Have you always wanted to play Hamlet?</strong></p> <p>Yes, for a very long time. And I was pretty certain it wasn\u2019t going to happen. I\u2019ve always wanted to understand what the big deal is. </p> <p>So they approached me to do it and I was like, of course! Yes! I started working through the speeches \u2013 the five great speeches \u2013 and I realized that every speech takes you through the whole emotional canon. Every speech, you have to go through it all. There\u2019s anger, there\u2019s remorse, there\u2019s fear, there\u2019s passion. It\u2019s not only the greatest role I\u2019ve played but also the most exhaustive role I\u2019ve played. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"178d305376c5f9e2a6bb053ffc1f2297ac670d3f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/178d305376c5f9e2a6bb053ffc1f2297ac670d3f/0_0_1556_2333/667.jpg\" alt=\"Christopher Ryan Grant (left) and Iwuji: \u2018We\u2019re holding a mirror up to nature for the audience and they\u2019re also holding it up for us\u2019\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Christopher Ryan Grant, left, and Iwuji: \u2018We\u2019re holding a mirror up to nature for the audience and they\u2019re also holding it up for us.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joan Marcus/2016 Joan Marcus</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>What sets your Hamlet apart?</strong></p> <p>Patricia McGregor\u2019s vision is to reflect the Black Lives Matter question. I actually phoned Patricia and I was like, \u201cLook, are you sure I\u2019m the guy you want to play this Hamlet? I know where you\u2019re going with this, the anger on the streets of America, the disappointment. Am I the right guy? Because I\u2019m not sure I embody that. I\u2019m not African American. I went to boarding school.\u201d</p> <p>She said to me, \u201cThe very fact that we\u2019re having this conversation is exactly why you\u2019re the right guy for it. That guy who finally throws a brick at the police, he doesn\u2019t want to be that. He\u2019s not born that way. That is Hamlet. He doesn\u2019t want to be a revenger. He\u2019s saying, \u2018Don\u2019t make me have to do this.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>I hope this Hamlet shows that. Hamlet has become this status performance, this cerebral thing. People have forgotten that at the core of it often is this thriller, this ugly, relentless beast that\u2019s about to be unleashed. That\u2019s my Hamlet. </p> <p><strong>Does the play feel different when you\u2019re performing in a prison or a homeless shelter?</strong></p> <p>Being on the road has made me realize the true difference between being a storyteller and being an actor. Often we want to be actors when actually our job is to be storytellers. The audiences, they\u2019re listening. They\u2019re cheering when Claudius gets killed, they\u2019re crying for Ophelia.</p> <p>On this tour the nature of performing has changed for me. When I go on to do the next play and the next play, it\u2019s all going to be about trying to find that sense of storytelling. Inasmuch as my art is my life, it has changed my life. </p> <p>You\u2019re told every performance should be fresh, it should always feel new, all that stuff. You\u2019re told it theoretically. But to be in the Mobile Unit is to experience that happening organically. Every room is different. Sometimes the conditions are different. Sometimes the inmates don\u2019t want to be there and you have to win them over. Sometimes they\u2019re so there with you. It changes your delivery. It changes why you\u2019re saying it. </p> <p>We\u2019re holding a mirror up to nature for these guys and they\u2019re also holding it up for us \u2013 we see the humanity that\u2019s in front of us. We\u2019re giving them this gift, but I\u2019d argue that they\u2019re giving just as much back. </p>",
  "<p>Pauline Hanson didn\u2019t appear out of a vacuum. Like Donald Trump and Nigel Farage, she is a reaction to trends in our society, economy and politics.

It is a sense of identity framed against a scary other. Asians or Muslims, gays or greenies, refugees or Indigenous people: the target can vary, but the frame is the same. \u201cOur\u201d way of life is under threat from \u201cthem\u201d.</p> <p>The challenge for those of us who oppose her is not just to respond to her \u2013 though we must stand up to and reject her racism. Nor is it even to respond to her voters. Our challenge is to respond to the circumstances which created her by building a more compelling alternative.</p> <p>Our challenge is to craft a better \u201cwe\u201d.</p> <p>Critically, this is not a communications task. It\u2019s not about working out how to speak better to people, or how to respond to misinformation. It\u2019s actually about changing our society, economy and politics to be truly inclusive and for the benefit of all \u2013 humans and the natural world we are one small part of.</p> <p>When viewed that way, crafting a better \u201cwe\u201d is an enormous task. But it is one which is full of opportunity.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Mandating a shorter working week would see us both share work more fairly and grapple better with work-life balance</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>At its heart is work. Never in the modern age has work been as precarious as it is today. Automation threatens not just jobs like manufacturing and check outs but also white collar jobs such as legal advice and anaesthetics. The rise of contract and casual work everywhere from cleaning services to academia makes work highly precarious for those who have it and increases the divide between those who are overworked and those who are underemployed.</p> <p>These forces combine to increase alienation, with people becoming disconnected from their jobs, feeling like governments do nothing to protect them, succumbing to an us-against-them mentality of blaming others in our society rather than the corporations and governments who enable this to happen.</p> <p>We can and must look at big picture and innovative responses to this challenge. One option often raised is a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jun/23/universal-basic-income-could-be-the-best-way-to-tackle-inequality\">universal basic income</a>, which would rewrite the relationship between employees and employers, give people confidence and flexibility, and reinvigorate the idea that we are all in this together. </p> <p>Ideally going hand in hand with this, mandating a shorter working week would see us both share work more fairly and grapple better with work-life balance, which seems to have gone out the window recently. </p> <p>Another idea in this area is supporting cooperatives, putting workers\u2019 jobs into their own hands.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jun/10/obscure-legal-system-lets-corportations-sue-states-ttip-icsid\">The obscure legal system that lets corporations sue countries | Claire Provost and Matt Kennard</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Then there\u2019s the challenge of reclaiming our politics, our public spaces, our very sense of the \u201cpublic\u201d, from corporate takeover. This goes far deeper than simply corporate donations to politicians, which one scandal too many has finally put on the agenda. It needs to disentangle the entire web.</p> <p>One of the most egregious and obvious examples has been the way international trade negotiations have been handed over to private interests. The peak of this trend is investor state dispute resolution, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jun/10/obscure-legal-system-lets-corportations-sue-states-ttip-icsid\">allowing companies to sue governments in a way which individual citizens could never dream of</a>. At the opposite end of the spectrum is the ever increasing handover of public space to private interests through advertising. How about declaring advertising free zones and removing the tax deduction for spending on ads?</p> <p>Then there\u2019s the way our schools, universities and research institutions are increasingly being run as profit-driven entities, training the next generation of workers and inventing new goods for sale, rather than as public institutions valuing knowledge for its own sake. This needs to be reversed by providing both sufficient funds and the appropriate remit to focus on educating citizens and researching for the public good.</p> <p>If we want to look really deep, let\u2019s challenge the very concept of corporate personhood, which enables companies\u2019 rights often to trump those of people, and certainly to overrule any rights of nature.

If anything, [today\u2019s Bank of Japan] announcement of new easing measures could even further discourage a Fed move, but as it already stands, there are very few market participants that are betting on such a move to higher interest rates, at least for this particular Fed meeting. Key Fed speakers and major US economic data releases have alternately shifted the discussion from one side to another in the past few weeks.

The one potentially brighter spot for the Fed was the Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation reading for August, which showed that both headline and core prices increased by more than expected. Despite this more buoyant view of inflation, however, it is still unlikely to be enough to sway the Fed into action today.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>Amidst all of these economic data releases and Fed member speeches, the market\u2019s view of the implied probability of a rate hike today has continued to hover in the low-to-high teens.

Should the FOMC choose to be headstrong and tear down conventional wisdom - a small possibility with two prime dealers coming out and calling for a rate hike - global markets will be shocked. But assuming the Fed plays it safe as it usually does, a lack of a rate hike may not hurt the US Dollar significantly. By suggesting that a rate hike is still \u201con the table\u201d in the near-term, and by laying out an interest rate glide path for next year calling for multiple rate hikes, then the Fed could help insulate the US dollar, plain and simple. It\u2019s starting to feel like a September-December 2015 redux.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57e29068e4b011f2eb711c1d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-21T13:53:00.899Z\">2.53pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>So what are the chances of a US rate rise?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/bondvigilantes/status/778589868704268288\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Every time the US FOMC has hiked rates in the past 20 years, the market was pricing in &gt;70% probability <a href=\"https://t.co/Sm3NIxhM2E\">pic.twitter.com/Sm3NIxhM2E</a></p>&mdash; Bond Vigilantes (@bondvigilantes) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bondvigilantes/status/778589868704268288\">September 21, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57e28de6e4b05d653ca5f402\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-21T13:46:48.550Z\">2.46pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Wall Street opens higher</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Ahead of the Federal Reserve interest rate decision, US markets are moving higher.

Yet when parliament voted last year to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/02/syria-airstrikes-what-happens-after-the-commons-vote\" title=\"\">approve limited military action in Syria</a>, MPs restricted British forces to airstrikes against specified Islamic State targets.</p> <p>Last weekend\u2019s battlefield bloodshed preceded the horrifying <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/21/syria-aid-convoy-attack-what-evidence-claims-russia-to-blame\" title=\"\">bombing of a UN aid convoy</a> by as yet unknown forces. The killing of Syrian soldiers has allowed Assad to turn the tables on the coalition and accuse Britain and America of deliberately targeting his forces. It is an accusation that once again places Britain at risk of fighting an&#xa0;illegal war in the Middle East.</p> <p>Assad claims the attack on his troops could not have been a mistake. Syria\u2019s Russian allies sought an emergency meeting of the United Nations security council to review the incident.</p> <p>And Russia\u2019s UN ambassador, Vitaly Churkin, described the timing of the attack as \u201chighly suspicious\u201d, adding that it did not look like an honest mistake. It was even claimed that Isis forces, the intended target of the coalition airstrike, used the attack to take ground from the regime forces.</p> <p>The Ministry of Defence has denied that Syrian soldiers were deliberately targeted and said the incident would be fully investigated. But should the Syrian victims&#xa0;want to take a case to the international criminal court in The Hague it will be doubly embarrassing for Britain. The US is not a signatory to the ICC treaty, so it would be left to Britain, Washington\u2019s junior partner in the coalition, to defend any charges. The Hague, of course, is exactly where many wish to see Assad (who also hasn\u2019t signed the ICC Treaty) facing charges of&#xa0;war crimes.

It was a British Reaper that took part in the US-led operation that caused the \u201caccidental\u201d deaths of the 62 Syrian soldiers and threatened the fragile truce.</p> <p>And it is the use of Reapers, based in Iraq,&#xa0;and flown remotely by satellite from an RAF base in Waddington, Lincolnshire, against Isis fighters who are British citizens that has triggered an inquiry. The government has confirmed that Reapers took part in operations to assassinate British Isis fighters in Syria who are said to have posed a direct threat to the UK. One of these strikes took place before the Commons had voted in December in favour of limited military action in Syria, killing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/08/how-did-britain-decide-to-assassinate-uk-isis-fighter-reyaad-khan-drone-strike\" title=\"\">Reyaad Khan</a>, 21, an Isis fighter from Cardiff who had appeared in a terrorist recruitment video.

But as each month passes Britain becomes more and more embroiled in the Syrian&#xa0;quagmire. As we commit increasing numbers of personnel and more hardware to US-led military operations, the risk of being caught up&#xa0;in illegal acts will only increase.</p>",
  "<p>The special minister of state, Scott Ryan, has declared any overhaul of the rules regulating donations and disclosure for political parties must also consider the role of activist groups, such as GetUp, otherwise reforms would create an uneven playing field, and not serve the public interest.</p> <p>In an interview with Guardian Australia, Ryan argued the big change in the past decade in Australian politics had been the rise of pressure groups capable of influencing election outcomes, and he argued it would be unreasonable to look at political parties in isolation.</p> <p>Ryan\u2019s comments about third-party influence come before an election campaign post-mortem on Thursday at the National Press Club by the Liberal party\u2019s federal director, Tony Nutt.</p> <p>The Coalition has been spooked during the most recent federal election <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/jul/06/election-2016-cory-bernardi-liberals-labor-volunteer-army\">by the extensive field operation</a> rolled out by Labor, the trade union movement and also the marginal seats operation of progressive groups such as GetUp \u2013 campaigns which are said to have had a significant impact in states such as Tasmania, where the government lost several seats.</p> <p>Internal recriminations about the lack of an effective field operation spilled into the public domain immediately after the election on 2 July.</p> <p>\u201cPeople rightly focus on political parties and the disclosure of donations, but I think one of the big changes that\u2019s happened in the last decade is the growing role, activity and influence of third parties and single-issue groups,\u201d Ryan told Guardian Australia.</p> <p>\u201cThey aren\u2019t subject to the same regimes political parties are, yet it is clear they can have a political impact,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cI make no judgment on whether that is, necessarily, a good or a bad thing, but the point I\u2019m making is if you are looking at the regulatory regimes and at financial contributions you need to look at donations, contributions such as the affiliation fees that unions pay to Labor, and you also need to look at the third-party or single-issue group activity because they are also funded by contributions and donations \u2013 and they have a big political impact.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s no point regulating political parties to within an inch of their life, and then saying it\u2019s a free-for-all elsewhere.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPolitical parties are actually an important institution because they act to diffuse the influence of any one person, whether it be political influence, or a financial contribution influence.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOne of the observations that I would make about what\u2019s happened in the United States is there are very strong regulations on political parties ... the difference between the regulatory model imposed ... has, in relative terms, empowered third-party movements.\u201d</p> <p>He said his comments did not mean the government would move ultimately to regulate third parties, but \u201cany difference between the two doesn\u2019t serve the interests of the broader polity\u201d.</p> <p>Ryan has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/15/turnbull-government-launches-sweeping-inquiry-into-donations\">recently sent a reference to the joint standing committee on electoral matters</a> asking the committee to canvass options for reform of the donations and disclosure system in the wake of controversy that erupted <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/07/sam-dastyari-steps-down-from-labor-frontbench-over-donations-row\">over a decision by the Labor senator Sam Dastyari to ask a Chinese businessman to cover a travel overspend.</a></p> <p>In a wide-ranging interview on the subject of donations reform, Ryan said:</p> <ul> <li>He saw no problem with the current threshold at which political donations are publicly declared, but signalled he was prepared to consider changes facilitating more continuous disclosure of contributions, noting: \u201cI think technology may be able to

Dean Garfield, president and CEO of the Washington DC-based technology industry advocacy group ITIC (Information Technology Industry Council), said that members of his group (which includes Amazon, Apple, Dell, EMC, Facebook, Google, HP, Intel and Microsoft) did not think Vestager\u2019s visit will have much of an impact.</p> <p>\u201cIt hasn\u2019t changed anything,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s aimed at explaining and putting in context what is largely inexplicable.\u201d Personal rapport, he said, is helpful to work through difficult trade issues, \u201cso a degree of familiarity and trust is helpful, but the policy implications remain the same\u201d.</p> <p>Technology industry analyst Tim Bajarin, president and principal analyst of San Jose-based Creative Strategies, was even more blunt. \u201cEvery major company we deal with has the same basic position \u2013 it\u2019s sensitive for them to speak out, but as far as they are concerned, they have paid every tax they legally owe,\u201d he said. \u201cA retroactive tax just doesn\u2019t sit well with anyone here in the US.\u201d</p> <p>Bajarin, who has been advising US technology companies for more than 30 years, also offers a historical perspective based on his own work with those companies when they were being courted by Ireland\u2019s Industrial Development Agency (IDA) to make a move to Ireland in the first place. \u201cHad they not built this program, they would not have built a tech industry in Ireland,\u201d he said.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/video/2016/aug/30/why-apple-is-facing-13bn-tax-bill-in-ireland-video-explainer\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/5xjmj\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2691352\"            data-video-name=\"Why Apple is facing a \u20ac13bn tax bill in Ireland \u2013 video explainer\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57c5a5a9e4b04fe839bc4fcd\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/08/31/160830applexplainerUPDATE_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/08/31/160830applexplainerUPDATE.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/08/31/160830applexplainerUPDATE_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/video/2016/aug/30/why-apple-is-facing-13bn-tax-bill-in-ireland-video-explainer\">Why Apple is facing a \u20ac13bn tax bill in Ireland</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>He also said that he was surprised by the European commission\u2019s decision to seek retroactive taxes, since the EU was well aware of the IDA\u2019s work with Apple and other technology companies from the start. \u201cFrom when they first did the program, they got the EU\u2019s approval \u2013 and nobody had any problems with it for almost 30 years.\u201d </p> <p>Bajarin also suggested that it loses sight of why tax incentives were offered in the first place. \u201cParents were getting upset with the Irish government [because there was no significant technology sector in Ireland] and their kids would leave. That was a huge issue and why the Irish government created this program \u2013 so Irish kids would have jobs in the tech industry. And it was very successful,\u201d he said. When Silicon Valley started booming, the IDA opened an office in San Francisco and pitched everything around tax, he explains.</p> <p>Yet despite concerns about the European commission\u2019s decision on Apple, virtually all of the players on the US side of the discussion concede that tax reform in the United States is part of the solution. Hatch weighed into the issue in his comments on the meeting with Vestager.</p> <p>\u201cWe must do our part to address the anti-competitive nature of the US tax code and the impact it has had on our domestic job creators both here and abroad,\u201d Hatch said. \u201cLowering the corporate tax burden and shifting to a territorial regime with base erosion protections will help shift our economic landscape and produce fertile ground for more businesses to invest here at home. It\u2019s an achievable, bipartisan goal that holds great promise, should we get a willing partner in the White House.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The Irish government created this program so Irish kids would have jobs in the tech industry.

We believe these changes should come about through the proper legislative process, in which proposals are discussed among the leaders and citizens of the affected countries. And as with any new laws, they should be applied going forward \u2013 not retroactively,\u201d he said. </p> <p>Vestager\u2019s US visit continues on Wednesday with a speech at New York\u2019s Columbia University called \u201cTax avoidance and privacy in the digital age: an EU perspective\u201d. She also issued a statement clarifying the commission\u2019s definition of \u201cstate aid\u201d as part of the announcement of a finding on Wednesday that found that \u201cfive public measures for purely local operations in Spain, Germany and Portugal involve no state aid because they are unlikely to affect trade between member states\u201d and will thus not be the subject of any commission action.</p> <p>\u201cIn many cases member states can stimulate investment without asking the commission,\u201d she said. \u201cThese decisions confirm that many local public support measures do not constitute state aid. This reflects the Juncker Commission\u2019s approach to be \u2018big on big things and small on small things\u2019.\u201d</p>",

This mafia was, Kefauver claimed, holding American cities to ransom. Communities lived in&#xa0;fear of it. The national economy was&#xa0;menaced by it.</p> <p>The televised hearings were at times ludicrous. One hoodlum after another was dragged to Washington to protest that all he was running was a few protection rackets on the Lower East Side. Try as Kefauver might to find a Mr&#xa0;Big to justify his extravagant hearings, he found only a disorganised trail of small-time hoods. He still demanded a&#xa0;new Washington bureaucracy to \u201ccrack&#xa0;down on organised crime\u201d \u2013 and&#xa0;ran unsuccessfully for president.

At a stretch, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/mar/21/judge-urges-madonna-guy-ritchie-resolve-dispute-son\">Madonna and Guy Ritchie</a> filled that brief in their time. But Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie were the biggest and glitziest of all, with their supersized family and affected normality (photos of them eating fast food with his inlaws in Missouri! Her lack of a publicist!) contrasted with their actually unimaginable inner lives. They were the rare celebrity couple who seemed genuinely into each other; after all, such was their initial attraction that it led to a divorce that has now been discussed longer than the marriages that both preceded and followed it. There was an air of old Hollywood glamour coupled with high-minded cerebralism about them that is hard to imagine any other celebrity couple pulling off now. Kim Kardashian, for example, tweets photos of her breasts for giggles; <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/24/opinion/angelina-jolie-pitt-diary-of-a-surgery.html?_r=0\">Jolie wrote a New York Times article</a> about her preventative double mastectomy.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"50cceb212f83e4ba1aadd58c5db56d69a6e95c6f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/50cceb212f83e4ba1aadd58c5db56d69a6e95c6f/0_77_1998_1998/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pitt and Jolie arrive at the Oscars, 2009.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pitt and Jolie arrive at the Oscars, 2009.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kevork Djansezian/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The truth is, Jolie\u2019s personal life has long been a lot more memorable than her acting (her last truly seminal film was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2000/mar/24/culture.reviews1\">Girl, Interrupted</a>, and that was made so long ago she was second billing to Winona Ryder, for heaven\u2019s sake).

Their relationship helped to define the 21st-century fame machine.

When they were first photographed on a beach in 2005 playing with Jolie\u2019s adopted son Maddox (\u201c12 pages of new pics that prove the romance is real!\u201d screamed the cover of a US tabloid), celebrity gossip blogs were in the ascendence while tabloid magazines, especially Hello! and OK! in the UK, and Us Weekly and People in the US, were expensively battling one another and the web to get the most sensationalist photos first. Few were more sought after than anything to do with the Jennifer Aniston\u2013Brad Pitt\u2013Angelina Jolie love triangle, such as pictures of Aniston doing yoga on the beach on her own (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/sep/20/jennifer-anniston-brad-pitt-angelina-jolie-feud-rivalry-sexist\">\u201cPoor Jen!\u201d</a>) and Pitt and Jolie on (presumably) a different beach looking in one another\u2019s eyes.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f7d2f1f299b071a6aaaecd1cc436a80b04ec0727\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f7d2f1f299b071a6aaaecd1cc436a80b04ec0727/0_67_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Serious about the world \u2026 Jolie and Pitt at the World Economic Forum, 2006.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Serious about the planet \u2026 Jolie and Pitt at the World Economic Forum, 2006.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fabrice Coffrini/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Between 2004 and 2005 the number of paparazzi in the US almost doubled because the nature of celebrity gossip was changing. Instead of knowing-but-cosy articles written by columnists \u2013 from Walter Winchell, Louella Parsons and Hedda Hopper in the 1930s to Nigel Dempster in the 70s and 80s \u2013 gossip shifted from being about words to being entirely about photos, and no one encouraged this shift more than the Brangelina behemoth. They rarely spoke about their family life except in the blandest of terms: tell-all expos\u00e9s would have been seen as far too tacky and self-exploitative for them. They were also too risky for Jolie, whose iron-clad image control became public knowledge when her stipulations about what journalists could and couldn\u2019t ask her <a href=\"http://www.bloggernews.net/17900\">were leaked online</a> (\u201cInterviewer will not ask Ms Jolie any questions regarding her personal life ... This interview will not be used in a manner that is disparaging to Ms Jolie ...\u201d).</p> <p>Instead, from the beginning, she and Pitt preferred to make their points through carefully controlled photo shoots and notably flattering paparazzi shots. Just three months after Aniston filed for divorce from Pitt in March 2005, he and Jolie ostensibly confirmed the increasingly hysterical rumours about their relationship when they posed for <a href=\"http://www.wmagazine.com/gallery/brad-pitt-angelina-jolie/all\">a 60-page fashion shoot</a> depicting them in domestic bliss while flanked by five little boys who bore a striking resemblance to Pitt. The shoot was nominally pegged to the release of their film <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2005/jun/10/1\">Mr and Mrs Smith</a>, but, as Pitt and Jolie knew perfectly well, it was the frisson of the are-they-yes-they-totally-are rumours that made a glossy magazine hand them 60 pages. They happily exploited the public interest while still maintaining a semblance of the moral high ground by not actually saying anything. After all, next to <a href=\"http://www.posh24.com/photo/1636012/tom_cruise_couch_jump_oprah\">Tom Cruise\u2019s sofa-jumping</a>, which happened that same summer, a 60-page (did I mention it was 60 pages?) fashion shoot looked downright self-restrained.</p> <p>In classic Brangelina style, they didn\u2019t confirm they were in a relationship until the following year when Jolie was pregnant, and this made them seem loftily above the overexposed antics of Paris Hilton, Lindsay Lohan and the rest of the celebrity landscape back then. (Not everyone was wowed by the Jolie-Pitts\u2019 decision to communicate by glamorous photo semiotics as opposed to boring press conferences: Aniston later said that the fashion shoot proved to her that her ex-husband lacked \u201ca sensitivity chip\u201d.)</p> <p>The truth is, of course, few exploited the world of modern fame more thoroughly than the Jolie-Pitts. When Jolie decided to give birth to their daughter, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/may/29/filmnews.film\">Shiloh, in Namibia in 2006</a>, the Namibian government, in a move straight out of Team America, enforced a no-fly zone over the coast where the family was staying. Pitt and Jolie invariably arrived last at red carpet events, such as the Oscars, thus ensuring maximum photo op, and, of course, there was the fascination with their multicultural children, which, again, the Jolie-Pitts did little to quell, with their strictly managed magazine shoots that sold for record-breaking millions. (If you think the Jolie-Pitts didn\u2019t use their family in their publicity, that they were merely compromising with the public\u2019s curiosity, ask yourself how many of their six children you can name. Three at least, probably. Now, how many of, say, Matt Damon\u2019s four children can you name? Even I had to Google that, and I write about this stuff for a living. This does not happen by accident.)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"436c07d1f7165280498c514cfaa6be74a8cdc21f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/436c07d1f7165280498c514cfaa6be74a8cdc21f/0_0_3000_2440/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pitt and Jolie with two of their adopted children, Maddox and Pax.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"813\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pitt and Jolie with two of their adopted children, Maddox and Pax.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dave M. Benett/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This double game \u2013 affecting to maintain privacy while actually being entirely in the public eye but only under their own terms \u2013 is what made them the perfect celebrity couple. They conjured up a form of \u201cintimacy at a distance\u201d, a term coined by Donald Horton and R Richard Wohl in their famous 1956 paper, <a href=\"http://visual-memory.co.uk/daniel/Documents/short/horton_and_wohl_1956.html\">Mass Communication and Para-social Interaction</a>. Most of all, they pulled it off by understanding the world of modern media better than the media understood itself. When the two of them needed to get the public back on side after Pitt\u2019s divorce from Aniston, and \u201cTeam Aniston\u201d sweatshirts were outselling \u201cTeam Jolie\u201d ones from LA boutiques by three to one, they didn\u2019t do it via the traditional means of fawning press interviews. As usual, they opted for photos. The two of them were pictured touring various developing world countries, with Pitt hugging children in orphanages and Jolie meeting victims of the 2002 civil war in Sierra Leone. Suddenly, they weren\u2019t the sex temptress and helpless hunk who broke the heart of America\u2019s sweetheart: they were the high-minded celebrity couple who were using their fame for good and, gosh, who has time for yoga and me-time on the beach when you\u2019re busy saving the world?</p> <p>Jolie, in particular, carved her own narrative for female celebrities in the 21st century: as opposed to being the lonely singleton followed by dated frump, which is the trajectory still accorded to every other famous woman, she was the sexual adventuress followed by idealised but still sexy mother figure and world saviour. Not even Madonna could pull off that combination successfully. It was genuinely interesting to watch her determinedly overturn the cliches, and while Pitt may have had the more successful career, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/nov/29/angelina-jolie-pit-i-am-on-fire-on-the-inside\">Jolie was always the more interesting one</a>, the brightly coloured bird of prey to his blond mouseburger. Until, that is, news broke this week that her family was about to endure the biggest Hollywood cliche of all.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c89cd761baf9d91c553455f5ffc2abb1b3c112d1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c89cd761baf9d91c553455f5ffc2abb1b3c112d1/0_137_3600_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Redefining female celebrity \u2026 Jolie talking at a Syrian refugee camp, September 2016.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Redefining female celebrity \u2026 Jolie talking at a Syrian refugee camp, September 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ahmad Alameen/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Celebrities get divorced all the time, but only a few celebrity divorces can be described as seminal. The BBC was not sending out alerts about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/aug/04/gwen-stefani-gavin-rossdale-file-for-divorce\">Gavin Rossdale and Gwen Stefani\u2019s divorce</a> last year. This is because, like the perfect celebrity couple, the perfect celebrity divorce has to represent something bigger to the public, either through a media-constructed narrative or through the scale of celebrities\u2019 cultural significance. There was Eddie Fisher and Debbie Reynolds\u2019 divorce back in 1959, when the housewives\u2019 favourite left America\u2019s darling for Elizabeth Taylor, the temptress of her era. (As Carrie Fisher, Reynolds and Fisher\u2019s daughter, has rightly pointed out since, her parents were the original Aniston and Pitt, with Taylor as Jolie\u2019s antecedent.) Taylor then left Fisher for Burton, which led to the next big celebrity divorce times two, as they married and divorced twice, while a fascinated public watched two highly public figures drive each other mad through their mutual sexual attraction and self-destruction. The next one was Cruise and Kidman, followed by Cruise and Holmes, both of which were only interesting, really, because of Cruise\u2019s weirdness, which became more apparent with each divorce. Some might include Paltrow and Martin in this list, with their all too memorable <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2014/mar/26/conscious-uncoupling-gwyneth-paltrow-chris-martin-separation\">\u201cconscious uncoupling\u201d</a>. But, really, next to the brightness of Taylor and Burton and even Jolie and Pitt (well, Jolie, mainly), they are too basic and beige in my eyes to make the cut.</p> <p>The narrative on Jolie-Pitt\u2019s split has yet to be decided, although Jolie is already showing her characteristically firm hand on that. Just as adopting a child on her own helped to change her image from \u2013 and I\u2019m paraphrasing here \u2013 kinky vampiric crazy lady to benevolent world saviour, so she is at least partly relying on her children to control the story. When news of the divorce broke this week, her attorney, presumably under Jolie\u2019s instruction, said that she had filed for divorce for \u201cthe health of the family\u201d. Her manager later reiterated the point, telling the media: <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-37427605\">\u201cAngelina will always do what\u2019s in the best interest of taking care of her family.\u201d</a> The inference being, of course, that Pitt\u2019s presence was somehow detrimental to their children. If being a perfect celebrity couple requires superhuman self-control, coming through a perfect celebrity divorce demands an unimaginable amount of personal drive.</p> <p>Rumours about the reasons for their divorce will run for decades, continuing to fuel the celebrity machine that they helped to shape and endure. Of course, the public will never know the full story, but that is always besides the point when it comes to celebrity gossip, where story matters more than truth and a person\u2019s symbolism is more significant than the actual person. Jolie and Pitt represented to the public, first, a passionate, forbidden love story, followed by a heightened version of an intimate, idealised family. In other words, theirs were stories more generally played behind closed doors, which is why so many people felt so personally invested in them. The end of their relationship clearly doesn\u2019t represent the death of love, as many of their fans have claimed online. But it does suggest the end of a kind of celebrity that managed to be conducted wholly on its own terms, with its own sort of dignity, which is already being destroyed in the divorce. The end of Brangelina is news in the way that the end of Burton and Taylor was news, not because of what they meant to themselves, but what they meant to the public. They knew how to play us better, it turned out, than they knew how to play themselves. That, perhaps, is the real definition of the perfect celebrity couple, and it\u2019s also why so many of them end up as the perfect celebrity divorce.</p>",

  "<p>Independent tests in the US have found that the energy consumption of Samsung and LG TV sets nosedives under test conditions but can soar by up to 45% in real-world use, raising questions of manipulation by software devices.</p> <p>TVs from the top three best selling US brands - Samsung, LG and Vizio - have also been found to be switching off power-saving features without warning, as soon as consumers make \u201cout of the box\u201d changes to their main picture menu settings, which can double the TV sets\u2019 energy usage. <br></p> <p>If just a third of LG, Samsung and Vizio TV owners changed their sets\u2019 pre-programmed picture settings, they could end up paying $1.2bn (\u00a3920m) extra on their energy bills and releasing an extra 5m tonnes of CO2 over the next 10 years, according to the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.nrdc.org/\">Natural Resources Defence Council</a> (NRDC), which commissioned the tests.</p> <p>Noah Horowitz, the director of the NRDC\u2019s centre for energy efficiency standards, said: \u201cIt appears that some major manufacturers have modified their TV designs to get strong energy-use marks during government testing but [they] may not perform as well in consumer homes.\u201d </p> <p>\u201cThese \u2018under the hood\u2019 changes dramatically increase a TV\u2019s energy use and environmental impact, usually without the user\u2019s knowledge. While this may not be illegal, it smacks of bad-faith conduct that falls outside the intent of the government test method designed to accurately measure TV energy use.\u201d</p> <p>In 2015, the NRDC began testing several manufacturers\u2019 ultra high-definition TVs in collaboration with the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.ecosresearch.com/\">Ecos Research</a> consultancy. More comprehensive laboratory and in-store tests were carried out this year of TV sets by firms, also including Sony, Phillips and Panasonic. </p> <p>The NRDC says that its results were shared with all TV manufacturers and none questioned their accuracy.</p> <p>The software involved <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/oct/01/samsung-tvs-appear-more-energy-efficient-in-tests-than-in-real-life\">was first revealed in a Guardian report last year</a> which is cited in the NRDC study. It is a feature known as \u201cmotion-detection dimming\u201d (MDD), which Samsung retails in European stores as part of the firms\u2019 9,000 and 7,000 series. </p> <p>It is not clear whether the exact models - the Samsung UN55JU7100, Samsung UN55JS9000 and LG 58UF8300 - are sold in Britain. But the product lines share the same screen size and many of the same or similar features.</p> <p>The energy performance of all TVs is highly dependent on brightness and other settings, and a <a href=\"http://www.coolproducts.eu/blog/vw-anniversary\">\u20ac400,000 study into power usage by big brand European TV manufacturers</a> is expected to announce its results later this year. </p> <p>The NRDC says that after being informed of the US test results, Samsung, LG and Vizio all said that they would consider modifying their TVs to address its concerns. </p> <p>However, John Taylor, a Vice President at LG stressed that \u201cLG disputes the findings in the report. LG has followed both the letter and spirit of the DoE [US Department of Energy] test procedure for TV energy testing, and we take great exception to the assertion that LG is \u2018exploiting a loophole\u2019 in the government test procedure.\u201d </p> <p>Taylor said the company was critical of the NRDC\u2019s test methodology and conclusions, particularly over the issue of \u201cnormal viewing\u201d. </p> <p>\u201cThere is no consensus on how to define \u2018normal viewing,\u2019 he added. \u201cThe NRDC\u2019s \u2018normal viewing\u2019 test clip and LG\u2019s \u2018normal viewing\u2019 test clip show significantly different results.\u201d </p> <p>Samsung maintains that MDD reduces power whenever any video motion is detected and so is a bona fide energy-saving measure.</p> <p> The company said in a statement that its TVs comply with US government guidelines and regulations: \u201cSamsung firmly rejects the accusation that we are misleading consumers. Our energy star rating is based on the default setting of our TVs. The majority of users stay within the default viewing settings through the lifetime of their television. Furthermore, we strongly believe that consumers should always have the option to customize the viewing experience on their TV.</p> <p>\u201cOur motion lighting and auto brightness control are default settings in our TVs. They are designed to save energy for consumers in real-world viewing conditions. Motion lighting reduces screen brightness when the picture on the screen is in motion. Auto brightness control adjusts the brightness of the TV automatically according to the ambient light level to reduce power consumption. Both are part of a range of features we have developed to help reduce the environmental impact of our TV technology.</p> <p>\u201cOur TVs have additional viewing settings for specific user preferences in which motion lighting and automatic brightness control are not active by default. Consumers are notified of this.\u201d </p> <p>While the NRDC accepts that TV firms may be trying to improve their customers\u2019 perceived enjoyment of programmes, the study says that they have nonetheless \u201ctaken questionable actions that run counter to the spirit of the law\u201d.</p> <p>Because the MDD feature reduced its TV sets\u2019 power usage during US Department of Energy (DoE) tests \u2013 by an average of 22% compared to real-world situations, but by 45% in one LG TV \u2013 the report suggests that manufacturers could be gaming the industry-designed International Electrotechnical Commission test clip. </p> <p>This is a distinctive 10-minute video spool of unusually short scenes, which is unlike normal sports, drama or news programme viewing. </p> <p> \u201cWe observed inexplicable, dramatic and sustained drops in energy use in TVs,\u201d the report says, \u201cbeginning within the first minute of the video test loop used in the Department of Energy test method for new TV models.\u201d </p> <p> \u201cIt is possible that some manufacturers have designed their TVs to detect the continuous occurrence of short scenes and frequent scene cuts and to \u2018optimise\u2019 their performance to reduce power when content with these characteristics is displayed.\u201d</p> <p>This would allow a TV manufacturer to gain a competitive advantage by publishing a low-energy usage rating, which does not reflect the products\u2019 likely performance in a real-world setting. </p> <p>Where the automatic \u2013 and often tough to reverse \u2013 brightening of screens is concerned, the NRDC report was unequivocal.<br></p> <p>\u201cSamsung, LG, and Vizio, which together represent half of all the new televisions sold in the United States, have designed their TVs to disable energy-saving features whenever users change the main picture setting,\u201d the report says.<br></p> <p>When viewers altered their TV\u2019s default settings \u2013 from \u201cnormal\u201d to \u201ccinema\u201d for example \u2013 features such as MDD and automatic brightness control (ABC) were automatically disabled, the report found. </p> <p>With many Samsung TVs, a simple change to the contrast, brightness or backlight settings would disable the MDD feature, without any warning to users. </p> <p>\u201cIf the MDD feature truly was intended to deliver energy savings and potentially reduce eye fatigue when content with certain characteristics is viewed, why would LG and Samsung design their TVs to disable this feature when the user selects a different picture setting?\u201d the report asked. <br></p> <p>Taylor said that LG was currently adding software for consumer notifications to its latest models, which informed consumers that changing picture modes could hike energy consumption rates. </p> <p>\u201cIt also allows consumers to turn on energy saving features in various picture modes,\u201d Taylor said, adding that LG was also planning to enhance the ABC features in its 2017 TV models. </p> <p>\u201cWe look forward to working with the DoE and stakeholders to develop a new test clip going forward,\u201d he said. </p> <p>The NRDC report identifies failings in the current test regime are a significant cause of the poor results in its survey.</p> <p>Chris Calwell, Ecos\u2019s principal researcher said: \u201cThe global standard video clip on which the DoE test method is based is eight years old and needs a major overhaul. DoE should update its test method with more realistic video content, including video encoded in high dynamic range (HDR), to ensure that the resulting measurements are closer to what consumers would actually experience when using their TVs at home.\u201d</p> <p> In the meantime, the <a href=\"http://www.coolproducts.eu/\">coolproducts campaign group</a> is calling for the European commission to outlaw the use of \u2018defeat devices\u2019 \u2013 where this is proven \u2013 and oblige TV manufacturers to inform consumers about changes to settings or software updates that could negatively impact on their sets\u2019 home energy consumption.<br></p>",

They scored their fifth point when Lewis McManus, aiming to hit Scott Borthwick to deep midwicket, found the third man boundary instead, with a thick top edge.</p> <p>Liam Dawson was lbw for 62 when he got one from Graham Onions that jagged back at him and kept low. Gareth Berg, pushing forward, was caught at second slip by Paul Collingwood off the same bowler, Mason Crane was bowled through the gate playing an indifferent stroke, again against Onions, and finally McManus slogged Borthwick to deep midwicket.</p> <p>When Hampshire bowled they appeared to get more out of the pitch than Durham had managed to. Berg was superb, repeatedly beating the bat with his nippy movement, so it was a surprise that he ended up with just one wicket in the day. But Hampshire, like Durham before them, invested more heavily in spin. It spun all day, but not more sharply than it had on the opening day. Unless the leg-spinner Crane was bowling, of course.</p> <p>Crane, 19, gave it a rip that would have earned nods of approval from another Hampshire leggie, Shane Warne. Rejected by Sussex as a youngster, he came to Hampshire and in his second championship match had figures of five for 35 against Warwickshire. England\u2019s talent-spotters, no slouches these days, already have him pencilled in for big deeds in the future.</p> <p>Durham lost the prolific Keaton Jennings for just a single, lbw to Berg shouldering arms. The other wicket to fall before lunch, when Durham were 44 for two, was that of Borthwick, who was caught behind attempting to cut Brad Wheal\u2019s first delivery of the game.</p> <p>The left-arm spinner Dawson, like Crane, was partially neutralised by the high number of left-handers in the Durham side. But Dawson broke through in his first over after the break when Mark Stoneman \u2013 like Borthwick bound for Surrey next season \u2013 jumped down the pitch and hit the ball straight to Jimmy Adams at a rather short midwicket.</p> <p>That brought in Stokes, who became more careworn after watching Graham Clark be caught behind off Dawson and then his captain, Paul Collingwood, caught at slip off Crane; 137 for five.</p> <p>Stokes threatened to get stuck into Crane when he block-drove a near yorker through mid-on for four and hit a short ball through midwicket for another boundary in the same over. But he was sixth out at 183 and two overs later Ryan Pringle produced a short-arm pull off Wheal and was caught at backward-square. That was 186 for seven but then Michael Richardson (50) and Brydon Carse (30) took them to 242 at the close without further loss. Hampshire have work to do still.</p>",
  "<p>Imagine if Hillary Clinton had a 6ft portrait of herself painted for a charity auction. Then Bill bid it up and paid for it with $20,000 from the Clinton Foundation.

His reporting unfolded as so many other journalists were writing their 50th stories about Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails. It is only in the past week that the Post\u2019s reporting on the Trump Foundation has gained traction. The issue should come up in the first presidential debate Monday, as those \u201cdamn emails\u201d, as Sanders called the over-covered controversy over Clinton\u2019s private email server, surely will. (The Trump campaign, by the way, has claimed that the report is \u201cpeppered with inaccuracies and omissions\u201d.)</p> <p>There is a clear disparity in the attention focused on Clinton\u2019s supposed ethics problems compared with Trump\u2019s. There has been some excellent reporting on everything from Trump University to his business practices, especially the tax breaks he received on real estate deals uncovered by the New York Times. But these revelations seem to roll off Trump\u2019s back, while in the Clintons\u2019 case they create indelible stains.</p> <p>I have covered the nexus of money and politics since 1988. My investigations revealed the twisting of the tax code governing charities by GOP political figures and different Democratic fundraising abuses in Bill Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign. When it comes to the cesspool of political money, I\u2019ve been an equal-opportunity scrutinizer.</p> <p>I also practically know by heart the tax code governing charitable groups \u2013 section 501C(3) \u2013 and immediately recognize that some of the Trump Foundation\u2019s donations involve unusual interpretations of it, to say the least.</p> <p>For example, when Melania Trump used a Trump Foundation check to purchase the towering (forgive the pun) portrait of her husband, the painting wasn\u2019t donated to a charity but apparently hung in the boardroom of one of her husband\u2019s golf clubs. The more than a quarter of a million dollars of Trump Foundation funds that went to help settle legal disputes included a case involving the height of a flagpole at Mar-a-Lago, Trump\u2019s estate in Palm Beach, Florida. And the conservative activist group that <a href=\"http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/trump-foundation-citizens-united-donation-eric-schneiderman\">received</a> $100,000 from the Trump Foundation was Citizens United, the group that opposes the disclosure and limitations of political fundraising and is headed by David Bossie, who was recently hired as Trump\u2019s deputy campaign manager.</p> <p>Perhaps the most salient thing about the foundation that bears his name is that Donald Trump himself has given a relatively small amount of money to the Trump Foundation and none since 2009, although we won\u2019t know for sure until \u2013 don\u2019t hold your breath \u2013 Trump releases his tax returns. Although there are some legitimate gifts to real charities, it\u2019s unclear what the Foundation actually <em>does</em>.</p> <p>Except for deep explorations by the New Yorker editor David Remnick, the Times\u2019 Amy Chozick and Celia Duggar, and a recent book by Joe Conason, relatively few journalists have looked seriously at the good works of the Clinton Foundation, especially on global health and the environment. The Foundation has given many millions to drive down the cost of anti-retroviral drugs to treat Aids in Africa and Latin America. It helped establish a multi-city fund for better technology to combat global warming and other environmental problems. The list of its projects could fill its own book. When I was managing editor of the Times, Bill Clinton invited a group of us from the paper to his office in Harlem for a barbecue lunch (this was before his heart problems and vegan diet) and spent more than three hours talking to us about the foundation\u2019s work.</p> <p>A separate and much smaller Clinton Family Foundation handles their personal contributions to charities. According to their tax returns, the Clintons as a couple have donated about 10% of Bill and Hillary\u2019s multimillion-dollar incomes in recent years to various well-known charities, more than most super-wealthy people, who give an average of about 3%.</p> <p>Though his vice-presidential running mate, Mike Pence, has said that Trump personally contributes \u201ctens of millions of dollars\u201d to charities, as with so much about Donald Trump, absolutely nothing has been made public to back up the claim. We are just supposed to accept Pence\u2019s word and the statement in a recent CNN interview by his campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, who calls reporters\u2019 questions about his charitable foundation \u201cbadgering\u201d, that Trump is indeed \u201ca very generous man\u201d.</p> <p>Personally generous he may sometimes be. The work of the Trump Foundation, however, is an entirely different question. For journalists, for regulators, for any citizen who cares about the future of this country, this isn\u2019t badgering. It\u2019s an urgent democratic duty. </p>",

Yes, it was an issue, but in difficult times underprivileged groups find a scapegoat. Some places with large immigrant communities, notably London, voted to remain, as did the whole of Scotland. The relentless anti-immigrant propaganda in the popular press played a major part in swaying leave voters. In the last year alone Germany took in around 1 million refugees, an astonishing figure. Yes, there have been problems, but the sky has not fallen in and Germany is not about to leave the EU.&#xa0;</p> <p>Poorer people living in deprived areas with few amenities feel the growing income gap. They read about absurd salaries and bonuses, and note the ostentatious flaunting of wealth. Meanwhile they are subjected to cruel cuts in benefits (which should be called entitlements) plus bedroom tax and the rest.

It caves in to the Conservative narrative instead of developing one of its own, much like Ed Miliband\u2019s disastrous campaign. Restricting immigration not only addresses the wrong issue but it simultaneously legitimises it.</p> <p>Labour should be addressing the anger of many leave voters by attacking decades of spending cuts to public services, catastrophic housing policies, and the decline of unions. Brexit negotiations could serve as a nationwide platform for demanding increased minimum wages, extended public investment, and stronger welfare \u2013 all of which would address the exploitation of both underpaid British and low-skilled EU workers.

The former is a stylish, 1950s-set noir thriller shot through with ambivalence about Hollywood, which is shown in all its dreamy allure and soul-crushing horror.

As well as its precise feel for character, place and pacing, it showed him to be a warmly attentive director of actors. He helped make stars of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/russellcrowe\" title=\"\">Russell Crowe</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/guy-pearce\" title=\"\">Guy Pearce</a> and gave <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/kevinspacey\" title=\"\">Kevin Spacey</a> one of his best roles as a narcotics detective seduced by Hollywood. Hanson refused to take any credit for the performances. \u201cWhat I try to do is give each actor an environment in which they can do their best work,\u201d he said. \u201cThen they go off and do the mysterious thing that they do.\u201d</p> <p>He conceded, though, that LA Confidential brought him to the attention of other performers keen to vacate their comfort zones. These included <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/michael-douglas\" title=\"\">Michael Douglas</a>, whom he directed intriguingly against type as a shambolic blocked novelist in the comedy <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2000/oct/28/features\" title=\"\">Wonder Boys</a> (2000), and Eminem, who had never acted before (and has not, to date, acted since) but who gave under Hanson\u2019s tutelage an affecting and low-key performance in 8 Mile that was approximately eight miles from his brash on-stage persona.</p> <p>Hanson was born in Reno, Nevada, and raised in Los Angeles by his mother, Beverly, who sold property, and his father, Wilbur, a primary school teacher. He shocked his parents by dropping out of high school and announcing his ambition to become a screenwriter. He took a detour into film journalism and edited the magazine Cinema, which brought him into contact with directors he admired and allowed him to pick up tricks of the trade. He became friends with legendary directors including Don Siegel and Sam Fuller. He later collaborated with Fuller on the screenplay for that director\u2019s last movie, White Dog (1982), an anti-racism drama about a dog trained to attack black people. Newcomer and veteran bashed out the script together in 18 days on matching typewriters in Fuller\u2019s unheated garage.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d86108dfa8996a70c1d114aff35e1c8670b71d63\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d86108dfa8996a70c1d114aff35e1c8670b71d63/415_536_2705_1623/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Curtis Hanson with Eminem, on the set of 8 Mile.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Curtis Hanson with Eminem, on the set of 8 Mile.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Universal</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He first began writing his own screenplays in the late 1960s. He was hired by the exploitation company AIP (American International Pictures) to write The Dunwich Horror (1970), before making his directing debut on another horror film, Sweet Kill (1972), and becoming one of four directors credited on the zombie movie Evil Town (1977). The starkest proof of Hanson\u2019s talent was his&#xa0;screenplay for the neat, nasty thriller&#xa0;The Silent Partner (1978), about a bank clerk (Elliott Gould) who tries foolishly to profit from a robbery. Alfred&#xa0;Hitchcock was reported to have admired the picture.</p> <p>Hanson directed the children\u2019s martial arts adventure The Little Dragons (1979) and the good-natured coming-of-age comedy Losin\u2019 It (1983), which starred a young <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/tomcruise\" title=\"\">Tom Cruise</a>. He wrote Never Cry Wolf (also 1983), about a biologist in the Canadian arctic wilderness, and directed The Children of Times Square (1986), a TV movie about a runaway who turns to crime. But it was The Bedroom Window (1987), a minor Hitchcockian thriller, which began to establish him as a budding master of suspense. He stayed in that genre for Bad Influence (1990), in which a strait-laced man (James Spader) is corrupted by a stranger, played by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/rob-lowe\" title=\"\">Rob Lowe</a>, and for The Hand That Rocks the Cradle (1993), a hit thriller about a diabolical nanny (Rebecca De Mornay).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4d879aea8e4fd7751e2347a93436690bc934c5cf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4d879aea8e4fd7751e2347a93436690bc934c5cf/0_130_2992_1796/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Toni Collette, left, and Cameron Diaz in In Her Shoes, an underrated comedy drama which Curtis Hanson directed in 2005.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Toni Collette, left, and Cameron Diaz in In Her Shoes, an underrated comedy drama which Curtis Hanson directed in 2005.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Sportsphoto/20th Century Fox</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The River Wild (1994) was a fascinating attempt to put <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/merylstreep\" title=\"\">Meryl Streep</a>, as a white-water rafter menaced by a pair of criminals, at the helm of an action movie. The film thrived on a unique exchange: the action genre benefited from an infusion of this esteemed actor\u2019s reputation while Streep herself seemed paradoxically lightened and lifted by the chance to head up a popcorn movie, albeit one of a superior stripe. Hanson did not so much direct her as emancipate her. The pair were reunited on-screen in 2003 when they played husband and wife in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/spike-jonze\" title=\"\">Spike Jonze</a>\u2019s bizarre comedy <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/adaptation\" title=\"\">Adaptation</a>.</p> <p>LA Confidential came next and marked an important turning point in Hanson\u2019s career. \u201cRather than being a director for hire as I have been on most of my films, LA Confidential is that one project where I\u2019ve been able to cash in the chips I\u2019ve earned from being lucky enough to have had a couple of financially successful films and saying: \u2018OK,&#xa0;now this is the film that I want to make.\u2019 It\u2019s my most personal movie. Whether it achieves any popular acceptance or not is less important to me. That\u2019s not why I made it.\u201d</p> <p>Continuing his determination to explore contrasting themes and milieux, he followed Wonder Boys and 8 Mile with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2005/nov/11/7\" title=\"\">In Her Shoes</a> (2005), a wise and underrated comedy-drama about two dissimilar sisters (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/camerondiaz\" title=\"\">Cameron Diaz</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/toni-collette\" title=\"\">Toni Collette</a>). He was disappointed to find the film dismissed in some quarters as a \u201cchick flick\u201d. \u201cMovies that deal with adult emotion don\u2019t get made today unless they can be put in that category,\u201d he complained.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2007/jun/22/drama\" title=\"\">Lucky You</a> (2007), with Eric Bana as a gambler, lacked Hanson\u2019s usual focus and confidence.

  "<p>On the beach in Kent this summer, my teenager went off to the gift shop. It is a treasure trove of tat. Whoopee cushions and shell ornaments, lucky dips, inflatable dolphins, toy swords and fairy figurines. She came back all agitated. \u201cThey are selling Jim Crow dolls in there!\u201d I didn\u2019t know what she meant. Then she showed me a picture. They were golliwogs, part of my childhood, but not hers. She didn\u2019t know the word and had never seen one. This is not down to that insane concept \u201cpolitical correctness gone mad\u201d. This is down to progress, where we tend to avoid giving children racist toys.</p> <p>She and my friend went back to the shop to have a word. The shopkeeper said: \u201cPeople love them, especially black people.\u201d My daughter, still outraged, wrote to the local mayor who replied that \u201cethnic dolls\u201d were not illegal and she could approach Trading Standards if there was a problem.</p> <p>Well, there is a problem all right because golliwogs have been making a comeback in the past few years, not just in this small seaside town, but all over the country. Fifteen years ago, when I first started visiting the Kent coast and would go to craft fairs, there were always knitted golliwogs. The old ladies made them, along with those crinolined dolls that cover toilet rolls, and lacy vacuum-cleaner covers. These women were in their 80s, from another era. It seemed pointless to have a conversation about racism with them as I simply assumed the golliwogs would die when they did. I was completely wrong. These things are now for sale all over the coast and in cities. They are brand new, often made in China. There is a thriving business online for \u201ccollectors\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/sep/21/enid-blyton-shop-golliwog-ad-asa\">Enid Blyton shop\u2019s \u2018racist\u2019 golliwog ad banned</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Every so often, some golliwog controversy comes to the fore. Some intrepid freedom-fighter insists on his or her right to sell golliwogs (\u201cIt\u2019s just a doll!\u201d). Anyone who takes offence at this is some loony-left zealot. It is especially good if the person who wants to sell golliwogs or dress up as one is themselves black or of mixed race. Rightwing papers excel in whittling out these oddballs. The latest is Viv Endecott, <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/09/21/enid-blyton-giftshop-has-golliwog-advert-promoting-english-freed/\">a woman who has decorated the windows of her Enid Blyton gift shop in Corfe Castle, Dorset, with tea towels featuring a golliwog</a>. An advert for this shop <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/sep/21/enid-blyton-shop-golliwog-ad-asa\">has been banned by the Advertising Standards Authority</a>. A spokeswoman for the store said the golliwog did not represent \u201ca negative racial stereotype\u201d but was, in fact, a \u201cheroic and aspirational role model\u201d. I have never met anyone who aspired to be a racist soft toy. Perhaps it\u2019s just me.</p> <p>It is telling that those who are nostalgic for the time when everyone proudly displayed their golliwogs refuse to accept the history of these figures. Created by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/feb/05/golliwog-history-florence-kate-upton\">Florence Kate Upton</a> in 1895, the golliwog grew out of caricatures of minstrelsy: big white teeth, frizzy hair, all one skin colour, large lips. Female characters are usually in servant costume.</p> <p>There is little ambiguity about these dolls; their literary presence spells it out. Blyton, in a Noddy story, has a naughty golliwog steal Noddy\u2019s car. In her book <a href=\"http://listverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/12/413px-the-three-golliwogs.jpg\">Three Little Golliwogs</a> (currently trading on eBay with the description \u201cBanned, so bid fast!\u201d), the characters Golly, Woggee and Nigger sing their favourite song, Ten Little Nigger Boys, which celebrates the death of 10 black children. In a 1975 edition of Agatha Christie\u2019s 1939 mystery Ten Little Niggers, a <a href=\"http://paradise-mysteries.blogspot.co.uk/2011/04/review-ten-little-niggers-agatha.html\">lynched golliwog appeared on the cover</a>.</p> <p>These harmless toys for white children fully dehumanise black people to such an extent that someone such as Carol Thatcher would, in 2009, refer to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2009/feb/03/bbc-drops-carol-thatcher\">a black tennis player as a golliwog</a>. It wasn\u2019t till that year that Hamley\u2019s banned them. By 2011, Bill Etherbridge, a prospective Tory councillor, <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1368713/Tory-husband-wife-posed-golliwogs-Facebook-forced-leave-conservatives.html\">was thrown out of the party after posing with golliwogs on Facebook</a>. He promptly joined Ukip and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/26/ukip-leadership-candidate-calls-for-bbc-to-be-privatised\">recently stood in the leadership contest</a>. He said he was merely trying to stimulate \u201chealthy debate\u201d. Right. He has also written a book celebrating golliwogs called <a href=\"https://images-eu.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/513Ge-4HS3L._SY291_BO1,204,203,200_QL40_.jpg\">Britain: A Post-Political Correctness Society</a>.</p> <p>This is exactly how these wretched things ended up back in the shops. Two things have been going on: the ongoing lie that political correctness (basically, manners) has gone so mad that an open display of racism brands itself somehow as an exercise of freedom. Such people always hark back to a time of \u201cinnocence\u201d. That innocence is now called white privilege.</p> <p>The other is the lie that we live in a \u201cpost-racist\u201d society. This is a view that is often expressed in Australia, where golliwogs are extremely popular. Yet if you go to any of the Australian websites selling them, you will see the vendors go with the word \u201cgollies\u201d, leaving out the obviously offensive bit. The tea towel of doom that caused the latest fuss in Dorset is a bizarre mind map. A golliwog holding a pint stands above the slogan \u201cEnglish freedom\u201d. Around it are phrases such as victimhood, safe space, freedom of speech, internet trolls, sharia law. You know \u2013 the kind of stuff you want on a tea towel.</p> <p>You see, this ubiquitous reclamation of the golliwog is neither fun nor nostalgic. It is less an ironic nod to our racist past than a stark reminder of our racist present.</p>",
  "<p>Theresa May posturing to the UN on uncontrolled migration (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/19/theresa-may-resists-calls-uk-accept-syrian-refugees-aid\" title=\"\">May refuses to take more Syrian refugees</a>, 20 September) was a little bit like a serial adulterer giving a lecture on the merits of fidelity in marriage. I\u2019m surprised she didn\u2019t get bottled off stage. First, Mrs May failed to reach UK targets on immigration during her time as home secretary. So, a case of the pot calling the kettle black. Second, the refugee crisis that she refers to is largely a consequence of UK foreign policy. In 2007, the UN estimated that the Iraq war caused 2 million people to flee the conflict. This year,the UN estimated that 4.8&#xa0;million had fled Syria. More than that fled Afghanistan during the UK\u2019s period of intervention.</p> <p>Surprisingly, dropping bombs upon people causes them to run away.

He would cut the tarpaulin in a vain attempt to evade the heat sensors and sniffer dogs. Each night he would be returned to the camp, often after a beating from the police.

This guided her through her Home Office days. She could reflect on what is happening in Canada, where Justin Trudeau\u2019s government has settled 30,000 Syrians, mostly families, mostly welcomed and sponsored by Canadian families. In the UK many people have offered to do the same, but Mrs May won\u2019t allow this to happen, even when people have offered full housing and financial support. Doesn\u2019t matter what is happening in Syria or elsewhere \u2013 \u201ckeep them out and leave it to others\u201d is the voice inside Mrs May\u2019s head, a voice not susceptible to humanitarian considerations.<br><strong>Bruce Ross-Smith</strong><br><em>Oxford</em></p> <p>\u2022 The real challenge facing world leaders attending President Obama\u2019s summit on refugees (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/18/refugee-crisis-rests-on-obama-summit-un-talks-fail\" title=\"\">Report</a>, 19 September) is tackling the root causes of migration, not just the effects. By ignoring the state-sponsored violence in countries such as Sudan (the source of the third-largest group arriving in the UK) our leaders seek a sticking plaster rather than a cure.</p> <p>Even more concerning is the UK\u2019s involvement in the so-called Khartoum process, whereby Europe aims to prevent Sudan\u2019s refugees from reaching Libya and the Mediterranean. If we turn a blind eye to Sudan\u2019s record of ethnically cleansing its non-Arab and non-Muslim citizens, refugees will continue to seek sanctuary \u2013 and are allowed to do so under international law. Were Sudan\u2019s government to be persuaded to stop bombing and oppressing its own civilians, they would be more likely to stay there.

He gave the offer careful thought in his apartment in Nagoya, where he was living while manager of Grampus Eight. His spell in Japan provided an experience that fascinated him. Far away from the madding crowd of European football, he immersed himself in a culture and in a way of life that was by its nature challenging, engaging, eye-opening, and at times lonely. The work was stimulating. But friends, family and familiarity were almost 10,000km away.</p> <p>The Arsenal opening represented a mighty leap in every way \u2013 professionally, culturally, personally. \u201cI was at a dangerous point and I had to make a decision. I felt that if I didn\u2019t come back now I would stay forever in Japan,\u201d he explained. \u201cAfter two years you get slowly emerged into this spirit. What you miss in Europe is slowly drifting away. I was at a point where I thought, I will make my life here if I don\u2019t come back now.\u201d His wife was pregnant with their daughter. Either they would make the big move to Japan to join him and Wenger would commit to deepening his roots in Asia, or he would return to Europe. In hindsight, this was a sliding doors moment. Who knows how his subsequent decades \u2013 and Arsenal\u2019s \u2013 would have turned out had he taken the other decision?</p> <p>Half a world away in London, his friend, the then Arsenal vice-chairman David Dein, awaited Wenger\u2019s choice. From their first chance meeting in 1989, when Wenger was passing through London with some time to kill on the day of a north London derby, Dein had been wowed by this individual who struck him as completely different to the average manager. He first proposed the idea of appointing this clever, worldly Frenchman working in the J-League in 1995, only for his fellow board members to reject it as far too risky. A foreign manager? What an audacious suggestion. There was no evidence to suggest it would work at all.</p> <p>There had been only one experiment with a manager from abroad in the top flight before. Aston Villa hired Dr Josef Venglos (predictably welcomed as \u201cDr Who?\u201d) in 1990. He arrived fresh from coaching Czechoslovakia at the World Cup, a multi-linguist who could communicate in Russian, Portuguese, Spanish and English as well as his native tongue. But a lot was lost in translation and Venglos left after one troubled season narrowly avoiding relegation. Venglos tried to introduce ideas relating to what he called: \u201cThe methodology of training, the analysis of nutrition, recuperation, regeneration and a physiological approach to the game.\u201d Frankly, most of those words sounded like they came from outer space to your average 1990 English dressing room.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/22/arsene-wenger-arsenal-20-years\">Ars\u00e8ne Wenger should have won more but English football owes him a lot | Barney Ronay</a> </p> </aside>  <p>We now live in an age when the currency of overseas managers in the Premier League has never been higher.

This rangy and athletic young midfielder \u2013 another Frenchman few in England knew anything about \u2013 was signed all of a sudden from Milan and represented a sort of advanced party before Wenger was freed from his commitments in Japan to start work with Arsenal. Actually it was more of an advanced present. Vieira made his debut midway through the first half of a modest performance against Sheffield Wednesday at Highbury under the caretaker control of Pat Rice. He came on and it was a shining lightbulb moment. Dennis Bergkamp, who was injured and watching from the sidelines, felt the crackling energy sweeping through dear old Highbury. \u201cWhen he came on he changed the game. He completely changed the game!\u201d the Dutchman recalls. \u201cAnd I think everyone in the stadium was thinking, \u2018What happened here? Did I really see it right?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Having been pedestrian and workmanlike in midfield for a few years \u2013 it certainly wasn\u2019t the team\u2019s most refined department \u2013 Vieira\u2019s appearance made a vital impression. He represented something fresh and different. As Wenger said: \u201cHe is the man who gave me the first credibility. It was a shock to people. He was like a genie from the lamp.\u201d</p> <p>Although life at Arsenal was about to change radically, Wenger did not want to be too judgmental or impose too much of a revolution without taking his time to look around and assess everybody.</p> <p><strong>1 October 1996. </strong>Wenger\u2019s first official day at work was spent at the training ground. Over the next two seasons he would introduce a range of new ideas. Some were based on science \u2013 everything from discouraging chocolate bars on the team coach, revising dietary habits and liquid intake (not only what you ate and drank but how you took it on board) and introducing stretching regimes and fitness specialists. Some were based on style of play, and short to-the-point training sessions designed to create the template for football that was both powerful and expressive. A knack for signing perfect players to fit the new jigsaw helped. In came quality of the calibre of Marc Overmars and Nicolas Anelka, whose pace frightened the life out of opposition defenders, and Emmanuel Petit, whose defensive instincts and long passes made him the ideal midfield foil for Vieira. All these ingredients whirled together to create a winning blend.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6344286a77359abe0da1c33b6e89a55857ae5c5f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6344286a77359abe0da1c33b6e89a55857ae5c5f/0_26_1632_979/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tony Adams\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tony Adams celebrates scoring a stunning volley in Arsenal\u2019s 4-0 win over Everton to seal the 1997-98 title.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Daily Mail/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For Bergkamp, the arrival of Wenger built a bridge between the football of his past, his education in the Dutch ideals of total football, and the never-say-die English football attitudes that were embodied by Arsenal\u2019s steely back four. There was a kind of symbiosis. Consider how Bergkamp absorbed the toughness which helped him to electrify the Premier League, or how Adams had the freedom to burst on to a chipped pass from Steve Bould to score with an impeccable volley.</p> <p>It all came together beautifully in Wenger\u2019s first full season as Arsenal won the Premier League and FA Cup double. There was something almost serene about how his team glided towards the honours at the end of the season. Wenger is acutely aware of the manifold complications football throws up, but just sometimes, and the finale to the 1997-98 double was one of those times, he has been able to experience the rare glow that transcends all the pressures. \u201cOf course. It happens when you feel your team is a really happy unit playing the game and enjoying it. Not distracted by any selfishness or any anxiety about the result. It\u2019s like you lead 3-0, everybody is up behind the team, they express themselves, they still respect the game. That\u2019s it. It sometimes lasts three, two, or one minute. It\u2019s so short, but you would battle forever to experience that again.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/gallery/2016/sep/22/arsene-wenger-20-years-arsenal-in-his-own-words\">Ars\u00e8ne Wenger's 20 years at Arsenal \u2013 in pictures and his own words</a> </p> </aside>  <h2><strong>The Wonder Years (1998-2006)</strong></h2> <p>Wenger\u2019s first decade yielded convincing, regular success. It was not without its towering disappointments. In between the doubles of 1998 and 2002 were three frustrating seasons of being close but not winning. They were league runners-up each season behind domestic rivals Manchester United, and also lost a bunch of painful semi-finals and finals. The rivalry with Alex Ferguson\u2019s team was intense and compelling.</p> <p>But overall, during the period between 1996 and 2006, Arsenal won the Premier League three times, FA Cup four times, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2006/may/18/match.championsleague\">reached the Champions League final</a> for the first time in their history and went through the 2003-04 league campaign undefeated. It was an era to bear comparison with the dominance masterminded by Herbert Chapman in the 1930s.</p> <p>A decade of high achievement is what the subsequent Wenger years are inevitably measured against. Recall of that time is important not only for the substance but also the aesthetic style. A team that had Thierry Henry in his prime leading the charge, with the artistry espoused by Bergkamp, Robert Pir\u00e8s, Freddie Ljungberg, Vieira, Kanu and company buzzing around the pitch (not to forget a toughened defence that took every goal conceded as an affront), won many admirers.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/sep/2016-09-21T13:43:45/embed.html\" data-alt=\"Interactive\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/sep/2016-09-21T13:43:45/embed.html\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>Although he is not a man who naturally enjoys looking back, making history with the \u201cInvincibles\u201d, the team that didn\u2019t lose a single league game, is a highlight that meant a great deal to him personally. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/oct/17/arsenal-invincible-season-arsene-wenger-inside-story\">\u201cIt was one of my dreams,\u201d</a> he said. \u201cI learned that you can achieve things that you think are not achievable.\u201d</p> <p>Wenger\u2019s time at Arsenal has coincided with the globalisation of the game, and creating an imprint, an identity \u2013 one that was in opposition to the \u201cBoring Arsenal\u201d tag they had carried for years \u2013 is something he is quietly proud of. \u201cSometimes when I speak to foreign coaches and ask about a player and they say, \u2018This is not an Arsenal player\u2019 this is the biggest compliment you can get,\u201d Wenger said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d2f4042942043e453417bea9026335bc3ca676e7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d2f4042942043e453417bea9026335bc3ca676e7/0_181_2829_1697/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Arsenal\u2019s \u2018Invincibles\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Arsenal\u2019s \u2018Invincibles\u2019 celebrate winning the title in May 2004, having gone through the season unbeaten.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Clive Mason/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Of course, in the process of 20 years not every transfer ended up in that this-is-an-Arsenal-player bracket. On the one hand Sol Campbell, on the other Igors Stepanovs. One hand Robin van Persie, the other Francis Jeffers. But Wenger got more than enough right in that opening decade to be brilliantly successful. It was a heck of a benchmark to live up to.</p> <h2><strong>Men Against Boys (2006-2013)</strong></h2> <p>Coincidentally or not, in splitting the Wenger years into two contrasting halves, the mid-point is the significant moment Arsenal relocated. Wenger loved Highbury. Even now, sometimes, this man who does not easily give in to the sentimental makes a diversion when he is driving to or from the Emirates and stops outside the old East Stand facade on Avenell Road to remember.</p> <p>But moving always felt, to him, imperative for the club to push forward. Having revolutionised the training facilities first of all by planning for a modern headquarters to be built (he went every day to the site at London Colney to check on the progress and is particularly fond of the fact they planted 280,500 trees), the complex question of Highbury\u2019s small capacity required considerable thought.</p> <p>When Arsenal decided to leave their ancestral home and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2006/sep/26/arsenal.paolobandini\">prepare for a move</a> that would in the end cost around \u00a3400m, Wenger knew and accepted that for a time it would compromise his team. What he did not know was that all Arsenal\u2019s plans would be thrown by the impact of oligarchs and billionaires landing suddenly to transform the football landscape. Arsenal\u2019s belt-tightening coincided with lavish spending elsewhere. \u201cYou feel like you have stones against machine guns,\u201d Wenger said. \u201cPeople don\u2019t want to know that. They just want you to win the championship.\u201d That period turned out to be more challenging than the club ever anticipated.</p> <p>Wenger\u2019s plan to sail the choppy waters with a modestly priced boat compared to the Premier League\u2019s financial powerhouses was to pin his faith on youth. The idea was brave: find the best young players you can, inculcate them with some club spirit, and develop a team that grows together and feels loyalty to one another and the cause.</p> <p>It nearly worked. Cesc F\u00e0bregas in his youth was sensational. In the group that included Van Persie, Samir Nasri and Abou Diaby, Wenger was sure he had enough talent to compete.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/sep/2016-09-21T16:09:16/embed.html\" data-alt=\"Interactive\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/sep/2016-09-21T16:09:16/embed.html\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>But project youth crumbled. It was perhaps the lowest blow for Wenger. The damage <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/aug/15/barcelona-cesc-fabregas-arsenal-tears\">when F\u00e0bregas</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/aug/26/samir-nasri-money-manchester-city\">Nasri left</a>, followed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/aug/17/manchester-united-robin-van-persie-everton\">by Van Persie</a>, was felt keenly. Wenger felt a very personal sense of loss. The ideology he believed in collapsed around him. Just before the stream of high-profile departures, while he fought to stem the tide, he admitted that the message it would send if they left was too great. \u201cYou cannot pretend you are a big club,\u201d he said.</p> <p>It was hard to take, particularly for someone who likes to manage with a strong emphasis on the human side of his players. Although it hurt, and other managers may well have been more ruthless in blocking moves, rightly or wrongly Wenger always tried to recognise that if a player wanted to go, it was time to let them go.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7ac45b77bb045cd72cb4e96ac7cc0fefc105785e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7ac45b77bb045cd72cb4e96ac7cc0fefc105785e/0_53_2142_1285/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cesc F\u00e0bregas\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ars\u00e8ne Wenger sought to rebuild around youngsters such as Cesc F\u00e0bregas, pictured here in 2004.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stuart MacFarlane/Arsenal FC via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The vulnerabilities in his team during these moments made it so tough to compete with the best around. The soft centre, the free-form style that on a bad day fell foul of well-organised opponents, the one or two elite players short they usually found themselves. Wenger bore the brunt of all the problems.</p> <h2><strong>A Second Coming (2014-15)</strong></h2> <p>How is your glass \u2013 half-full or half- empty? Depending on your perspective, the difficult, trophyless years provoked mockery and scorn or a quiet respect for the bigger picture. Several times during his Arsenal tenure Wenger could have left for other clubs. He never did. He stayed put, earning a handsome salary but also absorbing the flak. Why? Because he believes in an idea that is about more than honours for the CV. He started the project to see Arsenal over their expensive move, and he wanted to finish it. Whether he will or not is a question that frequently causes ripples in the fanbase. Is he the man to take the club back to the position they were in during the first decade of Wengerian Arsenal? Can he ever get them back to title-winning standards? There have been occasional close attempts, but no bullseye.</p> <p>After <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2005/may/22/match.sport1\">winning the FA Cup in 2005</a>, the last honour of part one of his tenure, Wenger endured moments of immense pressure and blame. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/aug/28/manchester-united-arsenal-premier-league1\">8-2 defeat at Manchester United in August 2011</a> was deeply humiliating. There were a cluster of those calamities in recent seasons, piercingly bad defeats that allowed Mourinho to deliver that cutting \u201cspecialist in failure\u201d line.</p> <p>\u201cThe immense importance of football is sometimes scary,\u201d Wenger said in his early days at Arsenal, admitting how it can be overwhelming to carry the burden of expectancy for a big club. \u201cWhen you don\u2019t win you are responsible for so many unhappy people. Sometimes it\u2019s better not to think about it because it could damage your life too much.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b10e805c500fc9c739ccafd9d655fd3d42a99cae\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b10e805c500fc9c739ccafd9d655fd3d42a99cae/0_36_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ars\u00e8ne Wenger\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ars\u00e8ne Wenger looks on during Arsenal\u2019s 8-2 defeat by Manchester United in August 2011.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Peters/Man Utd via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIt\u2019s the only way to survive. I don\u2019t go out at all. I stay at home and try to do my best for the club. But of course in bad moments, when you play away and you lose and you see after the game all those fans who travelled for 500 miles or 1,000 miles in Europe, and spend a lot of money, you feel that atmosphere. There is a strange vibration in the street when you lose at home. You feel responsible. But you cannot survive if you only feel that \u2013 you\u2019ll kill yourself. The professional aspect always takes over. \u2018Why did we lose? What did I do wrong?\u2019 But you can\u2019t just wipe out those moments.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/sep/2016-09-21T13:45:31/embed.html\" data-alt=\"Interactive\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/sep/2016-09-21T13:45:31/embed.html\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>Set against that analysis, it was meaningful when Wenger finally experienced the relief of winning again. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/may/17/arsenal-hull-city-fa-cup-final-match-report\">FA Cup final in 2014 against Hull City</a> was a rollercoaster. Going 2-0 down was, he said, \u201csurreal\u201d because the thought of losing when carrying so much expectation was unthinkable. Arsenal rallied and won the Cup 3-2 in extra time. \u201cWinning was an important moment in the life of the team. When it comes after a long time it sometimes comes with suffering,\u201d Wenger said. \u201cWe had such a feeling of relief and happiness.\u201d The following year they retained the trophy <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/may/30/fa-cup-final-arsenal-aston-villa-alexis-sanchez\">with a swashbuckling performance</a>.</p> <p>The graph was back on an upward curve. Silverware, and the ability to attract a higher calibre of player made a difference. When Wenger <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/sep/02/mesut-ozil-arsenal-real-madrid\">recruited Mesut \u00d6zil</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/jul/10/alexis-sanchez-signs-arsenal\">Alexis S\u00e1nchez</a>, signings that were out of their league in the drifting years, it was like suddenly buying a Porsche.

Now it is September 2016. He has had to roll with some heavyweight punches but has never come close to stepping out of the ring. What keeps him there is the feeling in his gut that keeps him obsessed by trying to win.</p> <p>\u201cI can only survive if I have that desire to win,\u201d he explained. \u201cIf you only fight to win that means you have to forget your life first and foremost. You feel you have more chance to win if you concentrate every part of your energy on doing that. If you lose a day by not concentrating on that you feel guilty. The years and the years and the years teach you that every small detail can make you win or lose. Once you are convinced of that you cannot allow yourself to relax any more because you think, \u2018Maybe I am making a mistake at the moment because I am not thinking about how I can win the next game.\u2019 You become a winning animal. Somewhere you slowly forget your own life. I think any manager can only be happy if he wins. We all live desperate for it, and everybody will do everything to win. It\u2019s not a regret, it\u2019s just an explanation of how the life of a manager is.\u201d</p> <p>Whatever his critics make of him, he retains the full support of his club\u2019s majority owner, Stan Kroenke, and the board. Their faith in him has not wavered. In Arsenal\u2019s broader diaspora there is black, white and every shade of grey whenever there is discussion about Wenger\u2019s ways. Some supporters frustrated by the ratio between high ticket prices and club honours vent their spleen and hold up banners. Others feel a sense of loyalty and affection for a man who has given a lot of himself to the club during his tenure. Many are stuck in the middle.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"492601d6398cd2adc4553da08f3705724c8ae259\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/492601d6398cd2adc4553da08f3705724c8ae259/425_0_2065_1239/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ars\u00e8ne Wenger\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ars\u00e8ne Wenger feels the strain during his side\u2019s 4-3 defeat by Liverpool on the opening weekend of this season.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Eddie Keogh/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There is also a range of emotions among ex-players, men who in some cases grew up while playing in one of Wenger\u2019s teams, and experienced defining moments of their careers in that time. It is curious that Wenger prefers to keep a professional distance with some of the greats who are starting out in coaching \u2013 Vieira, Henry, Bergkamp are among those who would have loved to return to work at the club but for whatever reason the invitations have not quite worked out. Others will never hear a word against him. Pir\u00e8s is at the training ground most days. Ray Parlour tells stories with enormous warmth that show another side to the man who can often appear reserved in front of the post-match TV camera.</p> <p>What the majority do not see is the personal side of Wenger, and the qualities that have kept him in the same job for so long. His keen intellect, his sense of trust in those around him (sometimes arguably too much trust), his dedication and his humour all make the man. He is very funny and has no problems laughing at himself. \u201cHe is such a clever man with such a knack at understanding people. But he could also be a walking disaster,\u201d said Parlour. \u201cHe would do something accidentally every day.\u201d He could get tangled up in the nets, drop the pudding off his plate without noticing, or join in a squad relaxation technique but lie with his legs up against a partition wall rather than a solid one and roll straight through it.</p> <h2><strong>The Future (2016-?) </strong></h2> <p>As The Bard wrote: \u201cOne man in his time plays many parts.\u201d After 20 years there is no single perception of Wenger and his time.</p> <p>We look today at the tall, wiry frame, sometimes bearing that strained expression when things are not going well, at others more urbane, with a ready wry smile and dry one-liner. In the current era of incessant managerial scrutiny, where millions of armchair managers give the impression of knowing better \u2013 something that occasionally provokes Wenger to dismiss the nerve of critics who cast judgment when they have never managed a single game \u2013 the pressure is relentless. But rest assured he goes home knowing that the biggest critic, the force who applies the harshest pressure, is the man in the mirror.</p> <p>Because of the sheer weight of a 20-year marriage, it is natural to veer between periods of joy and frustration, lurch from moments of absolute faith to fierce doubt. Naturally most opinions are shaped by what is going on now. Today\u2019s Wengerometer clearly does not hit the heights it has in the past. His Arsenal is a story in two acts. The first delivered wondrous success. The second has been complicated \u2013 maybe even so complicated, lasting a decade in itself, that many have forgotten how striking act one actually was.</p> <p>The last act is yet to be written. His current deal expires at the end of this season and, as with all his other contracts, the only person who will decide if he signs another, walks away, moves upstairs, or tries something completely different is him. It is, as Wenger says, the club of his life. \u201cWhat I like about Arsenal, and I am very proud of, is that the club is a mixture of respecting traditional values while not being scared to move forward,\u201d he said. \u201cI believe in the last 15 to 20 years you have all of that \u2013 fantastic periods, difficult periods \u2013 I stayed here for the respect I have for all that.\u201d</p> <p>Whatever happens and whenever it happens to end this collaboration between manager and club, Wenger is the last of his kind. The average timespan for a manager in England\u2019s professional game is currently 13 months. We will not see a 20-year boss at elite level again.</p>",

It\u2019s a film in which the lead character is briefly aware of becoming more attractive by losing weight \u2013 not so long after she had participated in a jokey student conversation about monkeys being sexually assaulted and then getting anorexia and having to see a therapist. And in a society where eating is somehow criminalised, cannibalism is an appropriate fantasy.</p> <p>Justine (Garance Marillier) is a teenager heading off to college to study veterinary science: her sister Alexia (Ella Rumpf) is already there, doing the same course a year ahead, and it becomes clear that her doting, protective parents (played by Laurent Lucas and Joana Preiss) took their own degrees there many years before. Justine is a virgin, an idealistic person, a believer in animal rights and above all a vegetarian. So she is horrified by a student initiation ritual in which she has to eat a rabbit kidney. Yet meekly aware of the need to fit in, she does it; she suffers a reaction for which the doctor suggests fasting and all this somehow triggers a whole new yearning.</p> <p>What is very impressive about Raw is that absolutely everything about it is disquieting, not just the obvious moments of revulsion: there is no let up in the ambient background buzz of fear. The scenes showing the frat-type \u201chazing\u201d are extraordinary and very convincing \u2013 as if studying to be a vet is like joining the Foreign Legion. Students are brutally woken in the middle of the night: humiliated, bullied, assured that not to submit would be to wimp out and let everyone down. Going to university was an experience which Justine had probably thought would be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to find herself, to express herself, to find her individuality and personality. Instead, college and adulthood seems more like a fascistic world of submission and staying in line \u2013 or even like some post-apocalyptic society in which these freaky cult rituals have grown up as part of survival.</p> <p>But she finds friendship and perhaps something more with her roommate Adrien (Rabah Nait Oufella), who has been assigned to her despite her request for a woman; he breezily assures her he is gay, which as far as the college authorities are concerned is the same thing. It is with Adrien that she goes to truck stops to eat the kind of glutinous sandwiches she can\u2019t get in the college canteen, and there they meet a sinister livestock haulier \u2013 a cameo for the Belgian director and actor Bouli Lanners \u2013 who has creepy things to say about the similarity of pig and human flesh.</p> <p>Just as in <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/news-opinion/news-bfi/lists/abel-ferrara-10-essential-films\">Abel Ferrara</a>\u2019s vampire horror The Addiction, college is an arena of fear: a sense that your entire sense of self is dissolving as you have to find your way in a new adult world of previously unsuspected menace, unsure if what people are making you do is normal or an outrage. And vet school \u2013 so apparently innocuous \u2013 is a place where you have to get used to the horror of animal flesh. To swallow it, in fact. Cannibalism becomes Justine\u2019s own initiation into adulthood.

  "<p>Sir Trevor Jones, who has died aged 89, formalised and finessed the practice of community politics for the Liberal party, later the Liberal Democrats. In the 1960s he developed new campaigning strategies including the delivery of Focus \u2013 the brash leaflet based on local issues that electors\u2019 identified with \u2013 that is still ubiquitous for Lib Dems. He was not its originator, indeed he was far too practical to be a theorist, but he developed the use of Focus and made it his trademark. As an organiser he had phenomenal energy and ambitions to match. First elected as a member of Liverpool city council in 1968, he was the dominant Liberal influence in the city for decades.</p> <p>Son of Owen and Ada, Trevor was born in the North Wales village of Dyserth, but his family moved to Bootle when he was young enough to acquire a clear Liverpool accent. He left the local grammar school in 1940, at the age of 14. He managed to conceal his age in order to join the Merchant Navy and served on the vulnerable Atlantic convoys that were essential to Britain\u2019s survival during the second world war. He later served in Aden and was in Singapore at the end of the war. Seeing the emaciated Allied prisoners being released from the infamous Changi prison camp had a great effect on him.</p> <p>After the war he worked on the Liverpool docks until, in 1961, he borrowed \u00a3200 to buy a business manufacturing dock fenders, which protect boats from docksides. He built this up and diversified into other businesses, including a ships\u2019 chandlery.</p> <p>Six years into his business life, one of his warehouses was threatened with demolition to make way for a new road. Trevor set about organising opposition and designing campaigning leaflets. Following an appearance before a House of Lords select committee to argue for conservation and against wholesale replanning in Liverpool, he turned to the political process as the way to influence decisions. His affinity with the underdog, and his Welsh roots, led him to join the Liberals, who at the time were barely above single figures in the polls.</p> <p>Within two years, he was elected to the city council, joining one other Liberal, Cyril Carr. Trevor was initially loyal to Carr\u2019s leadership, and at first he served as his deputy when the Liberals won control following local government reorganisation in 1973, but they fell out later that year. Carr gave up the leadership in 1975 on health grounds, leaving the way clear for Trevor. In 1973 Trevor was also elected to the new Merseyside Metropolitan county council and led the Liberal group there. Among the new city councillors was Trevor\u2019s wife, Doreen.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8d8dd52f8fc81c23872892cff2a992625b67adc2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8d8dd52f8fc81c23872892cff2a992625b67adc2/0_76_4096_2459/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Trevor Jones, second right, as a press conference with Michael Heseltine, far right, in the wake of the Toxteth riots, 1981.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Trevor Jones, second right, as a press conference with Michael Heseltine, far right, in the wake of the Toxteth riots, 1981.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Having established a strong Liberal bridgehead in a northern industrial city, based on community politics, Trevor was frustrated that the national party\u2019s official lip service to this strategy was belied by its respectable image, typified by its then president, Stephen Terrell, a barrister with a distinguished war record, but who had openly criticised the young Liberals\u2019 radicalism. Typically, after Terrell\u2019s year of office ended, Trevor decided to contest the presidency against the leadership\u2019s nominee, Penelope Jessel. He toured the country, distributed his Focus leaflets and romped home, serving in 1972-73.</p> <p>Even while he was campaigning for the presidency, he had got involved in the pending byelection in the Sutton and Cheam constituency, in south-west London. The party was at 8% in the polls nationally and locally it had struggled to hold its deposit at the previous election. The local association adopted Graham Tope as its prospective candidate, delighted to have a young Liberal activist who had not been put off by polling only 6% there at the 1970 Greater London council election. Thus, when Trevor approached Tope and asked if he would use his techniques, Tope agreed, realising that he had nothing to lose.</p> <p>Trevor took over the campaign with astonishing energy. He would pick on local issues, produce all the election material in Liverpool, then drive down to Sutton with his Triumph Stag stuffed full of Focus leaflets, which the local helpers then delivered. It was rumoured that a mattress that made an appearance in one set of leaflets had been transported from Liverpool by Trevor and dumped in order to be photographed and then publicly removed.</p> <p>Des Wilson, the candidate fighting Hove a short time afterwards, said that Trevor was driving him around when a woman tripped and fell on a pedestrian crossing. Trevor slammed on the brakes and leapt out of the car, grabbing a camera on the way. He then photographed the uneven surface before attending to the woman\u2019s injuries. \u201cIt will look good on a leaflet,\u201d he commented.</p> <p>The final result in Sutton and Cheam in December 1972 was a Liberal victory by more than 7,000 votes, conjured apparently out of nowhere by Trevor. On the same day as Sutton and Cheam, the Liberal candidate in Uxbridge, with a traditional campaign, polled just 10%.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>He was fierce with those who stood in his way. This applied to members of the SDP who stood against Liberal candidates</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Trevor himself fought <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/mar/25/britain-hung-parliament-1974\" title=\"\">two parliamentary elections in 1974</a> \u2013 the one in February, Toxteth in Liverpool, was theoretically ideal for his style, but he finished a poor third. He commented that he had spent too much time campaigning for other candidates. Trevor then contested Gillingham in October, but again finished third.</p> <p>Thereafter he concentrated on Liverpool city council and was leader of the council at the time of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/sep/14/toxteth-riots-1981-summer-liverpool-burned-patrick-minford-jimi-jagne\" title=\"\">Toxteth riots</a>, which upset him greatly. In 1981 he was knighted for his services to local government. However, the title he preferred was the one that combined his Welsh origins and his political skills \u2013 \u201cJones the Vote\u201d.</p> <p>Trevor was intensely loyal and committed, but he could be a difficult man, never content to be No 2, and had little time for those who did not accept his strategy. He was fierce with those who stood in his way. This applied to members of the SDP who stood against Liberal candidates in Liverpool in the 1980s and who, by splitting the vote, ensured enough Labour victories to put the party in control and open the door to Militant. Trevor was fearless in standing up to their councillors. On one occasion he so riled <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/jul/16/militant-derek-hatton-labour-party-1991\" title=\"\">Derek Hatton</a>, Militant\u2019s key man, that Hatton shouted: \u201cI\u2019ll dance on your grave.\u201d Trevor replied: \u201cThat\u2019s fine by me \u2013 I\u2019m going to be buried at sea.\u201d</p> <p>When, in March 1987, 47 Militant councillors were disqualified, the Liberals came back into control and Trevor was again leader of the council. His refusal to give way to the SDP meant that Liverpool Broadgreen was one of only three seats contested by both Liberal and SDP candidates at the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/electionspast/page/0,,1450576,00.html\" title=\"\">1983 general election</a>. He retired from the city council in 1991, but clearly found it difficult to be away from the action and returned in 2003 for a further six years.</p> <p>He is survived by Doreen (nee Brown), whom he married in 1950, and by a son, Glyn, and daughter, Louise.</p> <p><em>\u2022 </em>Trevor Jones, politician, born 17 December 1927; died 8 September 2016</p>",

  "<p>Ninety minutes from downtown Los Angeles, flowers of all shapes and sizes grow next to the historic US highway 101.

But if you are rich, you are a rich negro. If you are intelligent, intellectual, you\u2019re an intellectual negro. If you are a dancing and sliding and gliding nigger \u2013 I meant negro \u2013 you\u2019re a dancing and sliding and gliding negro. So dare not alienate because you cannot assimilate.\u201d </p> <p>The use of the racial epithet led to awkward laughter from Trump and other audience members.</p> <p>King\u2019s use of the term followed bizarre meandering remarks in which he argued that \u201cevery white woman should vote for Donald Trump\u201d and praised the Republican nominee as \u201ca doctor of humanness\u201d and as \u201cthe only gladiator\u201d. The boxing promoter, convicted of killing two men in separate incidents in the 1950s and 60s, bemoaned the media\u2019s treatment of Trump, saying: \u201cThey vet him like he\u2019s a politician.</p> <p>\u201cWhen the system was created, they did not give her, the white woman did not have her rights and she still does not have her rights,\u201d he said. \u201cDonald ... when I see them try to ridiculize him, or when they try to ostracize ... I want you to understand that every white woman should vote for Donald Trump ... to knock out the system.\u201d</p> <p>Trump followed King, praising the boxing promoter, who served four years for manslaughter and invoked his fifth amendment constitutional rights when asked about his ties to John Gotti in 1992, as someone who \u201ctook advantage of a lot of situations\u201d.</p> <p>King had reportedly been considered to speak at July\u2019s Republican national convention by Trump before his appearance onstage was vetoed by party chair Reince Priebus. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/20/donald-trump-african-american-communities-north-carolina\">Trump claims African American communities are in 'worst shape ever'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In his remarks, Trump struck themes that have become familiar in his attempts to win over African American voters. He argued that inner cities were less safe than Afghanistan and asked black voters: \u201cWhat have you got to lose?\u201d Trump\u2019s polling numbers among African Americans are usually in the low single figures. </p> <p>Trump has been trying to reach out to African American voters in recent weeks and is holding a televised town hall on the subject with Fox News\u2019s Sean Hannity airing Wednesday evening, which was scheduled to be taped earlier in the day.</p> <p>In an extract released on Wednesday afternoon, Trump came out in favor of a nationwide stop and frisk program. \u201cI would do stop-and-frisk. I think you have to,\u201d said the Republican nominee. \u201cWe did it in New York, it worked incredibly well and you have to be proactive and, you know, you really help people sort of change their mind automatically, you understand, you have to have, in my opinion, I see what\u2019s going on here, I see what\u2019s going on in Chicago, I think stop-and-frisk.\u201d</p> <p>Stop and frisk, the practice of New York police officers to stop passersby, question them and check for weapons, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/12/new-york-stop-and-frisk-unconstitutional-judge\">was found unconstitutional </a>by a federal judge in 2013 who held it to be illegal racial profiling. </p> <p>The Republican nominee faces a number of obstacles with African American voters, a traditionally Democratic demographic, including his longstanding insistence, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/sep/16/donald-trump-barack-obama-birther-video\">seemingly dropped last week</a>, that Barack Obama was not born in the US, and a history of housing discrimination lawsuits against Trump-owned real estate projects. He is hoping to overcome this with his message about jobs.</p> <p>The Republican nominee also answered a question from Scott <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/19/tulsa-oklahoma-terence-crutcher-police-shooting\">about the police shooting</a> on Friday of Terence Crutcher in Tulsa, Oklahoma.

  "<p>I doubt I\u2019m the only one disappointed in The Wire creator David Simon\u2019s decision to use the N-word in the context of a joke about Donald Trump choosing Sean Hannity to moderate a town hall focused on black issues. You would think that the man responsible for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2007/jul/21/tvandradio.guide\">the greatest black drama in television history</a> would be more aware of the fact that black folks don\u2019t like white folks using that word under any circumstances. Of course, that\u2019s sort of the problem here, isn\u2019t it? Isn\u2019t it peculiar that the best black TV show of all time was created by a white man?</p> <p>According to an investigation conducted by Variety, <a href=\"http://variety.com/2016/tv/news/diversity-television-white-male-showrunners-stats-fox-nbc-abc-cbs-cw-study-1201789639/\">90% of the showrunners</a> hired for new series in the 2016-17 season by broadcast networks (NBC, ABC, CBS, Fox, The CW) are white. Only four of the 50 new showrunners are black. David Simon\u2019s place at the head of the black drama table is not just because his show was fantastic. It\u2019s also because of a sheer lack of competition. It\u2019s been three years since Fox debuted Lee Daniels and Danny Strong\u2019s Empire and the networks still lag behind cable \u2013 the format that incubated The Wire \u2013 and streaming giants Netflix and Amazon. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/sep/20/atlanta-brian-tyree-henry-tv-fx-black-culture\">Atlanta star Brian Tyree Henry: if Trump gets elected 'it's going to be Mad Max'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The most exciting African American series to hit since Empire is FX\u2019s Atlanta, Donald Glover\u2019s ode to black America\u2019s capital city and a critical look at the modern infantile man. Glover plays Earnest Marks, an aspiring music manager struggling to provide for his estranged girlfriend and young daughter. There\u2019s a casualness of tone to Atlanta that\u2019s rare in prestige black TV. Empire exists in a heightened reality where people poison each other and push their pregnant rivals down the stairs. Dramatic reveals of long-lost mothers come and go without much fanfare, primarily because outrageous plot twists are commonplace. It dulls the senses to the point where nothing is shocking any more. </p> <p>In Atlanta, the southern black experience is treated as matter-of-fact and generally unremarkable. The stakes are small and intimate. Earn\u2019s cousin, the underground rapper Paper Boi \u2013 tragically unrelated to the Paperboy responsible for the song <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N58TYv7Vt3A\">Ditty</a> \u2013 sells drugs. He carries a gun. He goes to jail for shooting a guy over a broken rear-view mirror. No white character shows up to question the validity of this lifestyle. It\u2019s treated as merely the world in which these people live. Of course, this is part of the surrealist, comedic aspects of Atlanta \u2013 the underplaying of outrageous situations like a drug dealer shooting a man in the back with a hunting rifle or an inmate drinking toilet water while amused onlookers cheer him on \u2013 but it\u2019s also a true joy and a sign of black creatives behind the scenes that blackness is not seen as an impenetrable other. It\u2019s not exotic or beguiling. It\u2019s not mysterious. It just is.</p> <p>The emergence of black creatives behind the scenes of black entertainment has been slow. There have been numerous stops and starts since groundbreaking series like I, Spy and Star Trek made African American faces on TV more acceptable to white audiences. The success of the Wayans brothers\u2019 sketch series In Living Color led to numerous black comedies, many of them on the then fledgling Fox network: Living Single, Roc, Martin, True Colors. They often had black writers and felt authentic to the experience, though within the limiting confines of network TV. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"47832578620c09117f1d9591de5ea676dc44141e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/47832578620c09117f1d9591de5ea676dc44141e/0_68_1600_960/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Michael K Williams as Omar Little in The Wire\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Michael K Williams as Omar Little in The Wire.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: HBO</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Hope comes in the form of shows such as Marvel\u2019s upcoming Netflix superhero tale Luke Cage \u2013 run by black screenwriter Cheo Hodari Coker \u2013 and Ava DuVernay\u2019s Queen Sugar, a domestic drama about a family that inherits a sugarcane farm. This is as far away from the urban blight and shoot-em-up nature of the typical black series, typified by the Starz network\u2019s Power. Power \u2013 set, like Empire, in the music industry \u2013 suffers from the bleak, violent posturing that has come to define the African American experience on screen and in the media. Much has been made of Queen Sugar challenging black ideas of masculinity through a five-year-old boy character named Blue who carries around a doll. Combine that with Atlanta\u2019s ineffectual protagonist and his rapper cousin\u2019s questioning of hip-hop bravado and you have the makings of a trend.<strong> </strong>This also extends to film, as the upcoming Moonlight chronicles the struggles of a black man to come out \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/sep/03/moonlight-review-devastating-drama-is-vital-portrait-of-black-gay-masculinity-in-america\">a story rarely told</a>.</p> <p>It is not a coincidence that these refreshingly complex visions of blackness come from series fronted by black writers. It\u2019s not that white writers are incapable of telling black stories. Simon\u2019s work on The Wire is a prime example of when that scenario works. The Wire challenged our perception of what a prestige drama could be at a time when they were uniformly white stories of upper middle class suburban angst. What a white writer can miss is the subtle nuance of the experience of living in this world as a black person. When Simon excused his use of the N-word by saying he was employing the version with the suffix \u201ca\u201d as opposed to \u201cer\u201d, he thought he was playing within the boundaries of taste. The truth was that he was far from it, as he found out when numerous prominent black voices such as Jezebel\u2019s Kara R Brown, the Undefeated\u2019s Clinton Yates, the New York Times\u2019 Greg Howard, and New York magazine\u2019s Rembert Browne piped up with their displeasure.</p> <p>One can only know what it\u2019s like to be black in America by being black in America.

They are also not the subject matter you usually find being addressed on BBC4 late at night \u2013 that is, until this weekend.</p> <p>In an unprecedented move for the BBC, the Rolling Stones guitarist will be handed the reigns of BBC4 over three nights, to curate a weekend of programming about whatever he finds interesting. Working with renowned music documentary film-maker Julien Temple, Richards has put together a line-up of films, cartoons, music clips and footage that will be broadcast on the channel between 7pm and 4am each night, offering a rare insight into the intriguing mind of the 72-year-old.</p> <p>For Temple, the concept is something close to a pirate radio broadcast, with Richards taking over the airwaves and intruding into people\u2019s homes throughout the night, taking viewers on a continually surprising journey.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think many people could pull it off,\u201d said Temple. \u201cHe\u2019s one of the greatest raconteurs, so spending time with him is real quality time \u2013 and his life philosophy and survival strategies and contagious sense of humour will come together to create a good mix over those 27 hours.</p> <p>\u201cIt is an unknown quantity and people are meant to party along with it as well as just watch it.\u201d</p> <p>The broadcast will also be interspersed with an in-depth interview between Temple and Richards. With the length of time the all-nighter broadcast allowed, he said it offered a rare chance for people to get a comprehensive insight into the mind of the rock\u2019n\u2019roll veteran. Temple, who directed rock musical Absolute Beginners starring David Bowie, as well as documentaries on the Sex Pistols, Joe Strummer and the Kinks, said Richards saw himself as much as a poet and philosopher as a musician.</p> <p>\u201cSpending that much time with him, in a very free-ranging, relaxed, intimate interview, over three nights you will get to know him in a way you\u2019ve never done before,\u201d said Temple.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bff337308d2eae1eeabe094aaca4d65089d6dddb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bff337308d2eae1eeabe094aaca4d65089d6dddb/0_0_1960_929/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018He talks about life and death, he talks about badgers, he talks about fame\u2019 \u2026\" width=\"1000\" height=\"474\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018He talks about life and death, he talks about badgers, he talks about fame\u2019 \u2026</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Austin/Rex Features</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIt\u2019s interesting to see how he\u2019s dealing with where he\u2019s at now. I think you get incredible insights into how it felt to become famous so suddenly. The whole journey is in there, but the most fascinating thing is how at peace with himself he is these days. He talks about life and death, he talks about badgers, he talks about fame.\u201d</p> <p>Few people have lived a life like Richards, said Temple, and over the three days Richards will share the strange and colourful encounters that have made it so extraordinary. Laughing, he said: \u201cMy favourite story is about some mugger on the Lower East Side who jumped out on him late at night with a gun and said \u2018give me your money.\u2019 Keith turned round and the mugger said \u2018oh sorry Keith, I didn\u2019t know it was you\u2019.\u201d<br></p> <p>Richards was given completely free reign in his choices, which include Alfred Hitchcock\u2019s The 39 Steps, classic Italian film Bicycle Thieves, macabre horrors The Sorcerers and I Walked with a Zombie, as well as footage of Jimi Hendrix with Keith, and Keith even giving out his own recipe for shepherd\u2019s pie.</p> <p>At a time when people mainly access TV through on-demand and catch-up services, Temple said it felt exciting to create a piece of event television, which required people to tune in live without any real idea of what they would encounter.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s about pushing the envelope and trying to do something new with TV which is in a late epoch of its existence in the way we know it,\u201d said Temple. \u201cIt needs some jolts of life and risk. So yes it does feel experimental. It\u2019s tapping into people at night when they are receptive to different things.\u201d</p> <p>He added: \u201cIt\u2019s a bit like an intellectual DJ session \u2013 and you\u2019ve got to make it till the sun comes up on your television set.\u201d </p> <p><em>\u2022 Keith Richards\u2019 Lost Weekend is on BBC4 from 7pm on 23, 24 and 25 September.</em></p>",
  "<h2>Curb your enthusiasm</h2> <p>When the Newcastle United defender John Bailey first saw Paul Gascoigne training at the club he made a prediction: \u201cHe will either be one of the greats or finish up at 40, bitter about wasting such talent.\u201d</p> <p>As the Saracens wing Chris Ashton starts <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/20/chris-ashton-saracens-england-biting\" title=\"\">his second long suspension of the year</a>, one which has all but extinguished the flickering flame of his international career, he can reflect on a career that is burning itself out by the strength of its own heat.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2016/sep/20/rugby-union-calendar-world-rugby-test-schedule\">Players\u2019 interests must be at heart of any new timetable for world rugby | Robert Kitson</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Gascoigne, a national hero after his exploits, and tears, at the 1990 World Cup when England reached the semi-final (Gascoigne would have missed the final had England beaten West Germany having picked up a second booking of the tournament), self-destructed in the following year\u2019s FA Cup final between Tottenham Hotspur and Nottingham Forest when, after making the second of two high, wild tackles in the opening 15 minutes, he damaged knee ligaments that kept him out of action of 16 months. \u201cHe only has himself to blame,\u201d said the presenter Des Lynam.</p> <p>Ashton may not have Gascoigne\u2019s innate talent, but he shares the footballer\u2019s childlike enthusiasm for his sport, his relish for being the centre of attention and the exuberant way he celebrates scoring; he is one of the best finishers around but finished may be the word after the biting charges he had to answer at a disciplinary hearing this week and the ensuing 13-week suspension which means he will have spent six months of 2016 serving a ban.</p> <p>The wing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jan/20/chris-ashton-banned-10-weeks-miss-six-nations-england-saracens\" title=\"\">was banned for 10 weeks</a> last January, having just been recalled to the England squad, for putting his hand near the eye of the Ulster centre Luke Marshall. If it were a disproportionate punishment \u2013 set high because the offence was bracketed alongside eye-gouging rather than coming under the provisions of a dangerous tackle or reckless challenge \u2013 there had been a drive by World Rugby to deter players from wrapping a hand around the face of an opponent. A long suspension was the chosen weapon.</p> <p>And now, subject to appeal, he faces an even longer time watching from the stand. Saracens stood by their player before Tuesday night\u2019s hearing, although the image of Ashton seeming to bite the hand of Alex Waller did not square with the contention that the player was being victimised by citing officers. The club is entitled to check the wording of Ashton\u2019s contract to see whether a conduct clause had been breached, but it will stand by a player who struggles to control the almost nuclear energy he generates going into a game.</p> <p>The bite on Waller was a petulant response to an act the wing had himself committed on the same ground eight months before and, as with Luis Su\u00e1rez when he received a four-month ban from all football <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/jun/24/luis-suarez-bite-uruguay-ban-world-cup\" title=\"\">for biting the Italy defender Giorgio Chiellini</a> while playing for Uruguay at the 2014 World Cup a year after committing the same offence <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/apr/24/luis-suarez-10-games-ban-liverpool\" title=\"\">for Liverpool against Chelsea</a>, there was no mitigating factor.</p> <p>Ashton\u2019s first suspension was for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/dec/06/chris-ashton-banned-hair-pulling-brawl\" title=\"\">tugging the hair of Alesana Tuilagi</a> when he was playing for Northampton against Leicester in 2011 and after joining Saracens the following season he received a one-match ban for accumulating three yellow cards, having honed a tackling technique that owed more to mountain-climbing than rugby. The acts that have brought him before disciplinary panels have not been routine \u2013 a punch to the face or boot to the back\u2013 but those that are not so much the result of brain fades as a holiday of the senses.</p> <p>Biting is one of the (few) offences that was not tolerated in the amateur era when jungle laws were on the statute book. Like spitting, a miscreant could expect to be clobbered by someone on his own side before an opponent got to him. Incidents have been few in the last 25 years: the highest profile one in the Premiership involved the Bath prop Kevin Yates who received a six-month suspension in 1998 and resurrected his career in New Zealand before returning to England and playing for Saracens. Others include <a href=\"http://www.stokesentinel.co.uk/rugby-player-banned-biting-finger/story-12575522-detail/story.html\" title=\"\">fingers being nearly bitten off</a> and ears <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/7635752.stm\" title=\"\">being chewed</a> in Wales as <a href=\"http://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/news/wellington/69240209/Sean-Fitzpatricks-ear-bitten-in-Springbok-attack-150-years-of-news\" title=\"\">well as New Zealand</a>.</p> <p>Gascoigne battled to control his nervous energy, going into the 1991 FA Cup final in such a state of feverish excitement having struggled, as usual, to sleep the night before that he fell off the edge as he ran on to the field. Ashton is a wing who likes to involve himself in a game rather than hang around waiting for a pass but his enthusiasm too often gets the better of composure which is why his international career stalled two years ago on 39 caps and 19 tries.</p> <p>Eddie Jones recalled Ashton to the England squad last January only for the 10-week ban to delay his comeback. In his first match for Saracens after the suspension at Bath, he scored two tries but escalated an incident after Anthony Watson took out Alex Goode in the air, shoving his opponent needlessly, and Jones\u2019s admiration for Ashton cooled.</p> <p>Saracens feel Ashton is being victimised, his reputation going before him, but that is to suggest Waller would not have been cited had he bitten Ashton\u2019s arm. Waller could have been cited for two offences in the second-half, a dump tackle on Jamie George followed by head contact with the hooker\u2019s face, but the referee dealt with both incidents on the field after watching a replay on the big screen, something that should rule out citing commissioner involvement.</p> <p>There have been times when a player\u2019s reputation seems to have been a factor \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/may/27/england-dylan-hartley-world-cup-four-week-ban\" title=\"\">Dylan Hartley\u2019s citing last year</a> for a head-butt on Jamie George was arguably more about him than the offence, no pain or injury caused. But with his record why give the citing officer a decision to make?</p> <p>Ashton will be inconsolable as he contemplates another long exile from something he loves. If he accepts that it was a consequence of his own rashness and owns up to an act which has no place in a sport that promotes family values, he will rise from it. If he plays the victim card, the only way will be down and, like Gascoigne, he will look back on a career which, while far from being a failure, delivered less than it should have with heart ruling head.</p> <p>\u2022 This is an extract taken from The Breakdown, the Guardian\u2019s weekly rugby union email. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/18/sign-up-to-the-breakdown\" title=\"\">To subscribe, just visit this page and follow the instructions.</a></p>",
  "<p>Consumers across Europe should be able to pay the same for using their mobile phones abroad as they do in their home country for an unlimited number of days, under plans being debated by the European commission as it tries to abolish roaming charges.<br></p> <p>The commission discussed new proposals on Wednesday as part of an EU plan to abolish roaming charges by June 2017, after Brussels officials were forced into a U-turn.</p> <p>Roaming charges have become a political football, as the EU executive searches for ways to give the European project more popular appeal amid the eurozone debt crisis and Brexit negotiations.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/apr/30/end-bill-shock-eu-mobile-roaming-charges-slashed-phone\">An end to \u2018bill shock\u2019 as EU mobile roaming charges are slashed</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The cost of sending messages and making calls abroad has been slashed by more than 90% since the EU began capping roaming charges in 2007. Now the commission wants to phase out roaming charges entirely by next year. </p> <p>But Jean-Claude Juncker, the European commission president, ordered his officials to rewrite the draft plans after deeming they did not go far enough.<br></p> <p>Under a previous draft, telecoms companies would have been allowed to charge people more for using their phones abroad for more than 90 days a year. But Juncker ordered his officials to go back to the drawing board, after criticism from members of the European parliament.<br></p> <p>The change has alarmed the telecoms industry, which argued that 90 days was already stretching the definition of periodic travelling. The average EU citizen is abroad for 12 days a year and only 0.1% of European consumers will be affected by abolishing the 90-day cap.</p> <p>Andrus Ansip, a European commission vice-president, said the earlier plan had not won support. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t accepted by member states or service providers. It was one idea, [but] it didn\u2019t fly.\u201d</p> <p>Mobile phone costs vary significantly across the 28-country bloc, with prices in Latvia more than six times cheaper than in Ireland. Phone companies are concerned the law would mean consumers could buy cheap sim cards in one country and use them permanently in another. They claim cheaper companies would be saddled with the higher costs of customers who are not genuinely roaming.</p> <p>In response, the commission has promised to introduce safeguards: telecoms companies would be able to check on consumers who appear to be permanently roaming and charge them more. Customers will be able to complain to national telecoms regulators if they dispute the charges.<br></p> <p>Consumer groups argue that phone users face unjustified costs. One survey cited by the European Consumer Organisation (BEUC) found that roaming calls could cost up to \u20ac2 (\u00a31.70) a minute \u2013 20 times more than the cost of making a domestic call. </p> <p>Monique Goyens, the BEUC director general, welcomed the decision to drop time limits on roaming. \u201cConsumers should be able to make phone calls, send messages and use the internet for the entirety of their stay abroad and not be charged additional costs when travelling for a long period of time, working or studying in another EU country.\u201d</p> <p>But questions remain about how abuse of the proposed regime will be defined and policed. Phone operators will be responsible for checking suspected abuse, but industry sources say this raises many practical difficulties, such as checking residence when a British student is doing a six-month course in Germany. \u201cThe burden is on the operator to check \u2026 and I don\u2019t know what we will do,\u201d one industry source said. \u201cWill we have to ask for the certificate from the university?\u201d</p> <p>The European Telecommunications Network Operators\u2019 Association, which represents providers including T-Mobile and Orange, said: \u201cA careful evaluation of all the technical, legal and economic aspects of this decision is vital.\u201d </p> <p>The commission will announce detailed proposals in mid-December, after consultation with telecoms regulators and EU member states.</p> <p>Roaming charges also feature among the many unanswered questions about Britain\u2019s vote to leave the EU. If the UK were to remain a member of the European Economic Area, which includes all EU member states plus Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland, British consumers would continue to benefit from the abolition of roaming charges. </p> <p>But a more detached relationship with the EU could lead to Britons paying higher prices to use their phones on the continent. Swiss consumers pay more for data roaming than any other member state, according to the Body of European Regulators for Electronic Communications. Swiss phone users pay 35 eurocents per megabyte of data when using their phones abroad, compared with an average of 6-7 eurocents across the European Economic Area.</p> <p>The Bruegel thinktank, which drew attention to the issue in a recent<a href=\"http://bruegel.org/2016/06/mobile-roaming-brexit-and-unintended-consequences/?utm_content=bufferde468&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_campaign=buffer+(bruegel)\"> article</a>, concluded that British consumers would pay more to roam after Brexit. It remained \u201ca safe bet\u201d that UK residents with UK mobile subscriptions would pay more for using their phone in Europe than EEA citizens would pay, it said.</p>",

But there\u2019s also a fetishistic edge to watching Jolie glowering past those perfect cheekbones at her husband because he doesn\u2019t sufficiently appreciate the drapes, or watching Pitt, the movie star who serially dated the most celebrated women in Hollywood, stutter and stammer and try to avoid confessing his sex life isn\u2019t so great. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dd0352b2b4becc67df7b909b9491f3bee3ef018f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dd0352b2b4becc67df7b909b9491f3bee3ef018f/0_0_2700_1621/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mr and Mrs Smith\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pitt and Jolie \u2026 just like us?</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/20th Century Fox</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Jolie\u2019s dominatrix getup is given extra va-voom because she hides it under a demure coat in preparation for a great reveal \u2013 and because the boots accidentally peek out when she\u2019s at a neighbor\u2019s suburban party. Similarly, Pitt\u2019s caddish dudebro bumbling is funny and engaging because it\u2019s secretly a front; in the film he repeatedly adopts the persona of a clueless civilian schmo in order to conceal his suave uber-competent spy deadliness.

Yes, right before <a href=\"http://www.fox.com/empire\">Empire</a>. </p> <p><strong>What is this show about? </strong>Dude, it\u2019s Lethal Weapon! You know <a href=\"http://www.empireonline.com/movies/features/lethal-weapon-cast-reunion/\">the 80s (and early 90s) movies with Danny Glover and Mel Gibson</a> before he was likely to go on alcohol-fueled tirades against police? Now, instead of waiting years between each one of their cases, you only have to wait a week. </p> <p><strong>Who plays Glover and who plays Gibson? </strong>Damon Wayans is Roger Murtaugh, the \u201ctoo old for this shit\u201d cop who wants to do the right thing but is worried about getting home to his gorgeous, supportive wife (Keesha Sharp) at the end of every shift. Clayne Crawford is Martin Riggs, the suicidal rogue who lost his pregnant wife in a car crash and is now the reckless hero of the police force. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXZdEmvcFdU\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/cXZdEmvcFdU?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p><strong>Are they any good? </strong>Wayans is an old pro and finds the perfect balance between action and laughs. Watching the man try to sit in an Eames chair turns into an inspired bit of physical comedy. Crawford, who is superb on <a href=\"http://www.sundance.tv/series/rectify\">Sundance TV\u2019s Rectify</a>, finds the pathos in Riggs but, dare I say it, the character is annoying. When he saunters into a bank robbery with a stack of pizzas or gets into a bar fight because that is the only way he can feel pain I just want to change the channel and watch someone whose personality seems more lifelike \u2013 for instance <a href=\"http://screenrant.com/game-of-thrones-best-daenerys-targaryen-facts?view=all\">Daenerys Targaryen on Game of Thrones</a>. But most importantly, the two have fantastic chemistry and by the end of the second episode Riggs\u2019 sullen tics are a bit less ludicrous. </p> <p><strong>How many times does their boss force them to turn in their badge and gun because they\u2019ve gone too far? </strong>None yet, but their captain (Mad Men\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/mad-men-star-kevin-rahm-794433\">Kevin Rahm</a>) yells at them at least three times an episode. In a nice hat tip to how unlikely all of their cases are, the captain keeps a running tally of how much the collateral damage to their escapades costs the city. It\u2019s well in the millions.</p> <p><strong>What happens in the first episode?</strong> You know the basics of the story: Riggs\u2019 wife dies and he moves to LA and joins the police force where he\u2019s partnered up with Murtaugh who is just returning to the force after heart surgery. They investigate what seems like an open-and-shut suicide, but it leads them to a cadre of drug runners. Car chases, explosions, shootouts and a few well-placed quips follow.</p> <p><strong>Is it good?</strong> Well, it\u2019s enjoyable. But this is the kind of show where an escaping killer steals not just a car but a propane truck. Why? So that Riggs and Murtaugh can shoot the tanker turning it into a fireball that rolls down the middle of a Hollywood street. Even more ridiculous is when a truck full of fireworks (why is there always a truck full of fireworks lying around?) that they set off to save them in a tense situation. Like the 80s movie it\u2019s based on, everything is big, loud and extreme. However, when going for extreme it can also be extremely ridiculous. </p> <p>The real draw for viewers, just like in the original, is the relationship between the two main characters. Like I said, the state of that union is strong but it never quite captures the level of likability of the original. As long as watching these guys bro out and stop crime is entertaining, they should have a healthy show on their hands.</p> <p><strong>Should I watch this show? </strong>Sure, if you have a yen for a throwback action movie. This is by no means <em>must-see TV</em>, but you can do a lot worse than this over-the-top procedural which would rather make things go boom than make sense. </p>",
  "<p>Our love of social media seems to have grown and grown in the past decade, but recent studies show the tide may be turning for some platforms, with young people in particular ditching Facebook. One study claims that more than <a href=\"http://business.time.com/2014/01/15/more-than-11-million-young-people-have-fled-facebook-since-2011/\">11 million teenagers left Facebook</a> between 2011 and 2014. It\u2019s been argued that they are <a href=\"http://theconversation.com/so-long-social-media-the-kids-are-opting-out-of-the-online-public-square-53274\">swapping public platforms such as Twitter and Instagram</a> for more private messaging apps like WhatsApp and Snapchat.</p> <p>We asked the Guardian\u2019s younger readers whether they have quit social media and why, as well as what apps they are ditching. Almost all reported a greater sense of happiness after going offline. Here, we share some of their experiences. <br></p> <h2>Daisy, 23, Manchester: \u2018I feel less anxious and less like a failure\u2019<br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"2f3c2c53e32a69a840d7974a9a264c5368e23a76\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2f3c2c53e32a69a840d7974a9a264c5368e23a76/0_0_280_280/280.png\" alt=\"Daisy\" width=\"280\" height=\"280\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>After a romance ended with a guy I really liked, I kept trying to avoid Facebook so I wouldn\u2019t have to see him.

When I went online it seemed like everyone was in Australia or Thailand, and if they weren\u2019t travelling they were getting engaged or landing great jobs. I felt like everyone was living the dream and I was still at home with my parents, with debt from my student loan hanging over me. </p> <p>I also felt that if I wasn\u2019t tagging myself at restaurants or uploading photos from nights out, people would assume I wasn\u2019t living. I remember a friend from uni said to me once, \u201cYeah, but you\u2019re still going out having fun, I\u2019ve seen on Facebook.\u201d I tried to present myself as always having a great time.

I also feel less anxious and less of a failure. </p> <p>I\u2019m planning to visit a friend in Australia next month, and she and my mum and a couple of other friends want me to go back on Facebook to share my pictures.

After doing this I started to ask, why am I using it at all? That\u2019s why I\u2019ve quit various platforms over the past year: Snapchat in November and Facebook in June. I\u2019ve never really had WhatsApp or Twitter. I mainly used Facebook at university, for organising events and meet-ups, but I\u2019ve gradually started to realise how pervasive is it. I also feel uncomfortable with the amount of time I used to spend on it. <br></p> <p>I\u2019ve always found social media to be an environment in which people constantly seek attention and validation through one-upping people\u2019s comments, and boasting over likes and retweets. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We\u2019ve not needed social media for thousands of years and now people think your life is over if you don't have it</p> <footer> <cite>Ben</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>We\u2019ve not needed social media for thousands of years and now it feels like people think your life is over if you don\u2019t have it, which is ridiculous. I joined when I was 13, but I don\u2019t feel like I really knew what I was signing up for and the platform has changed a lot over the years. There\u2019s much more advertising on it now, for example.</p> <p>I didn\u2019t find it hard to quit and, after a while, contacting people through other means became the norm. People completely respect my not being on social media, and some wish they could do it too. Since I left, I\u2019ve spoken to people about it and that\u2019s convinced them to do the same.</p> <p>I\u2019m more productive and less concerned with what other people think about me \u2013 now, the only person I have to regularly compare myself with is me. I\u2019m in a much more positive mindset without social media than I ever was with it. It\u2019s let me see who my friends truly are, and who I was only concerned with simply because they were there on social media. I now use a basic non-smartphone and email as my only forms of communication, and people have adjusted to it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"24b3e2ca46c1e6ccb5e273969f365035eef465b9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/24b3e2ca46c1e6ccb5e273969f365035eef465b9/0_162_4928_2956/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Twitter on a phone\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Twitter has more than 300m monthly active users.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Damien Meyer/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Syed Ali, 19, Birmingham: \u2018I don\u2019t need to prove anything to people\u2019</h2> <p>There\u2019s so much negativity on social media, with people complaining about how tough their lives are (and these are the same people who post a picture of every meal they eat).

I can live my life instead of trying to shape it into one that looks good online. I also have a lot more time now, and it\u2019s easy enough to keep in touch with my friends in other ways. What\u2019s more, now we can have conversations about what we\u2019ve been doing because we haven\u2019t seen it all already on social media.</p> <p>I don\u2019t plan on going back to Facebook, but I still have my Instagram account, which I check once a day. Instagram is different because it\u2019s not as time-consuming, and you don\u2019t get bombarded with other people\u2019s views. Plus, the Instagram community is more supportive. I gave up Twitter years ago because it didn\u2019t really feel like it had a point, and it was just a space for opinionated people to air their views in a non-constructive way.</p> <h2>Kevin, 23, Dublin: \u2018I enjoy actually talking to people face to face\u2019 </h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"089ce807d373e3d5df48f197e765e68b25b39625\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/089ce807d373e3d5df48f197e765e68b25b39625/0_0_280_280/280.png\" alt=\"Andy Staunton\" width=\"280\" height=\"280\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>When I used Facebook, I found myself aimlessly watching videos and scrolling through articles that I never had any interest in reading in the first place.

So if the Tories are going to lose seats, they will lose them to the Lib Dems, he told his conference.</p> <p>Conveniently for the Lib Dems, <strong>Chris Mullin</strong>, the former Labour minister, is making exactly the same argument. He has just published <a href=\"https://profilebooks.com/hinterland-hb.html\">Hinterland, a memoir,</a> and in it he says Labour needs a Lib Dem revival because \u201cthey can win seats in places we can never hope to hold.\u201d</p> <p>More significantly, Mullin, a leftwinger and former minister, calls for an electoral pact with the Lib Dems and the Greens. Here is an extract from his book.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Although the Tories have by historical standards only a small overall majority, the political realities are stark. Labour is between a rock and a hard place. Too left-wing for the southern middle classes, not left-wing enough for Scotland. Given that Scotland is not likely to return to the Labour fold any time soon, I see only one way forward - an electoral pact with the Liberal Democrats and the Greens designed to ensure that in, say, a hundred of the most marginal seats the Tories face a united opposition. Tribalists on all sides will throw their hands up in horror at the prospect, but the truth is that Labour badly needs a Liberal Democrat revival because they can win seats in places we can never hope to hold. One should never say never in politics, but the alternative is an indefinite period of Tory rule. Think about it.</p> </blockquote> <p>Even Farron did not go quite this far. But there is increasing interest in the idea of some kind of progressive alliance on the left. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/18/labours-lisa-nandy-urges-party-to-ditch-tribalism\">The Labour MP Lisa Nandy has co-edited a new book that explores the idea. </a>Paddy Ashdown, the former Lib Dem leader, is supporting <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/19/liberals-celebrities-and-eu-supporters-set-up-progressive-movement\">a separate initiative promoting cross-party progressive cooperation. </a>And the Green party, under their new co-leaders Caroline Lucas and Jonathan Bartley, are actively pushing the progressive alliance theme.

And the way it was done was even more disgraceful. At the end of an NEC, when people had left, a paper laid round and a decision taken on a vote of 14/14. And it was carried on the basis of a recommendation. So it was 14 people basically preventing 140,000 [sic] people having a vote.</p> </blockquote> <p>Although people who joined after January were able to vote if they paid \u00a325 to become a registered supporter, McDonnell said many people could not afford that. He said many of those excluded were Corbyn supporters.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>So we lost, I think, a large group of people who were Jeremy Corbyn supporters. I think never again should we allow that to happen.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He criticised the proposal from Tom Watson, Labour\u2019s deputy leader, that was debated at the NEC yesterday to change the leadership election rules and reintroduce an electoral college.</strong> McDonnell said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>One thing about our party now is it\u2019s based on one person one vote. I don\u2019t want to go back to some of the proposals that have come forward today [for] electoral colleges. Because what that would mean, as it was before ... the parliamentary Labour party gets a third of the votes. It will mean for every individual MP, their vote will mean 3,000 or 4,00 of ours. That is unacceptable.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He criticised the way Labour has applied rules banning some members from taking part in the election</strong>. People were being suspended \u201cfor the bizarrest of reasons\u201d, he said. He said he know one woman who was suspended for tweeting that she supported the Greens; but she was talking about a team from her child\u2019s primary school, not the Green party. McDonnell said the decision to include \u201ctraitor\u201d as a word that could lead to people being suspended if used on social media was questionable, because it features in the Red Flag, sung by all members at conference. On that basis, everyone should be excluded, he said.

But McDonnell insisted that, even if Corbyn got a lower share of the vote than the 59.5% he got last time, that would not weaken his mandate. McDonnell said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I think it\u2019s going to be really tough to get the 59.5% that we got last time around because of the numbers that have been prevented from voting.

  "<p>If you have stumbled across the Isle of Man, chances are it is in one of two contexts: tax havens or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/isle-of-man-tt\">motorbike racing</a>. Few know that the 32-mile-long crown dependency is also home to a parliament of Norse origin, thought \u2013 at more than 1,000 years old \u2013 to be the oldest continuously sitting legislature in the world. Even fewer know that, in its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jun/20/isle-of-man-campaign-abortion-law-modernisation\">general election</a>, 16-year-olds can vote and party politics is insignificant. And hardly anyone knows that the Isle of Man is on the cusp of a momentous shift in its political history.</p> <p>Carlos Phillips is 27 years old and is standing on the 22 September to become a member of the House of Keys, the island\u2019s equivalent of the Commons. Among the 62 other candidates jostling for position are a dentist, a sidecar racer, a theatre producer, an architect and a nurse. It\u2019s not your average Westminster lineup. But this isn\u2019t Westminster.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There\u2019s nowhere to hide here. Ministers and backbenchers are all held accountable when they walk to buy a sandwich</p> <footer> <cite>Carlos Phillips</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cThere\u2019s nowhere to hide here,\u201d says Phillips. \u201cThe approachability of politicians in the Isle of Man is unrivalled. Ministers right the way down to backbenchers are all held accountable when they walk down a street to buy a sandwich.\u201d</p> <p>What makes this election so significant, aside from the colourful cast? First, the chief minister (the island\u2019s prime ministerial equivalent) is stepping down, along with a handful of long-time MHKs, meaning that the average age of a member, currently around 56, is likely to plummet. Second, of the 24 seats, just 17 are being defended, meaning that at least 30% of the intake will be fresh faces.</p> <p>At approximately 86,000, the island\u2019s population is roughly a sixth of Manchester\u2019s. Yet Phillips thinks there is plenty the UK could learn from the accountability and accessibility that comes from national politics with a local flavour, not to mention the freedom from the dogma and spin of party politics.</p> <p>\u201cWith the lack of parties, it\u2019s hard to label people red, yellow, blue or green,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd without a party machine behind you, you really do rely on your own self-drive. In that respect, it\u2019s good: you can\u2019t rely on researchers or policy officers to formulate answers on your behalf. It\u2019s all down to you.\u201d</p> <p>Most importantly, the new candidates can see that the conversation is being changed. In the northern constituency of Ramsey, GP Alex Allinson is promising a \u201cvital increase\u201d in healthcare investment. In Arbory, Castletown and Malew, Carl Parker wants to legalise medical cannabis and tackle fuel poverty through investment in green energy. If either gets in, they will be one of 24 key people calling the shots.</p> <p>\u201cThere are exciting opportunities to enrich our parliamentary debates with some new-generation thinking,\u201d says Phillips. \u201cIt\u2019s one of those momentous times.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>His Dark Materials author Philip Pullman has welcomed a \u201cbadly need[ed]\u201d new proposal from the European Commission that would protect authors who achieve unexpected success from missing out on royalties.</p> <p>Pullman was speaking as president of the Society of Authors, which is pressing the UK government to adopt clauses from the <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/transparency/regdoc/rep/1/2016/EN/1-2016-593-EN-F1-1.PDF\">new EU draft directive on the digital single market</a> in order to \u201cavoid unfair practices that currently prevent authors making a living from writing\u201d.</p> <p>The new draft directive, released last week, states that authors \u201coften have a weak bargaining position in their contractual relationships, when licensing their rights\u201d, and that \u201ctransparency on the revenues generated by the use of their works or performances often remains limited\u201d, with this affecting their remuneration.</p> <p>It proposes two safeguards, which the Society of Authors says are particularly important for writers. The so-called \u201cbestseller clause\u201d would give authors the right to claim additional and appropriate remuneration if the returns in their contracts are disproportionately low compared to the subsequent profits from exploitation of the works. The transparency safeguard, meanwhile, would give writers a right to regular and adequate information on the exploitation of their works.</p> <p>\u201cI welcome this draft directive, especially for its emphasis on transparency and the bestseller clause. Authors badly need the sort of natural justice that these clauses embody, not least because our work contributes substantially to the wealth of the nation,\u201d said Pullman. \u201cI hope that our government will see the rightness of these proposals and embody them firmly in the law of our land to ensure that they continue when we leave the EU.\u201d</p> <p>Society of Authors chief executive Nicola Solomon urged the UK government \u201cto implement these clauses without delay\u201d, and for the provisions to be adopted in UK law, given that the directive is unlikely to have effect until after Britain has left the EU.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jan/15/earnings-soar-for-uks-bestselling-authors-as-wealth-gap-widens-in-books-industry\">Earnings soar for UK's bestselling authors as wealth gap widens in books industry</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cPublishers too often fail to give their authors full information on sales and exploitation of their work.

  "<p>It\u2019s late. You\u2019re a little worse for wear. And feeling nostalgic. </p> <p>You know that what you really shouldn\u2019t do now is send a text, yet the more you try to talk yourself out of it, the worse the urge gets. </p> <p>You wake up the next morning in a full-body cringe, dreading the ritual rereading of your phone. You wish you hadn\u2019t sent that text. Later, you might try to repair the damage (and your ego) with yet another text. And so the cycle of impulsivity and regret continues.</p> <p>Lots of people write letters or emails they don\u2019t ever intend to send, as a means of harmlessly getting it all out there, or of constructively thinking about what they would say to someone in a magic world where it would be productive and relieving to do so. But text messages are different, because the short format, immediacy and ease of clicking \u201csend\u201d make it harder to control.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/mar/20/i-am-funnier-and-franker-on-google-chat-but-whats-the-truth-about-instant-message-me\">I am funnier and franker on Google chat, but what\u2019s the truth about instant-message me?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Fascinated by this dynamic, the New York-based artist Hanny Ahern began texting herself instead of the objects of her agita. She added herself as a pseudonymous contact in her own phone, and sent herself the sometimes \u201celaborate emoji compositions\u201d or words, redirecting the urge to send impulsive texts. </p> <p>\u201cIt changed the way I used my phone from anxious and impulsive to creative and fulfilling,\u201d says Ahern. \u201cWhen I would get a notification from myself, I would feel a certain excitement, almost as if I were getting a text from another person. I\u2019d go back to the messages months later and be so grateful that I sent them to myself instead of to the other person, because I realized how much time had changed my perspective.\u201d </p> <p>Moreover, Ahern realized she wasn\u2019t alone. \u201cMany of us seem to be in a room together with a text-bubble draft looming in our heads, unsent and unrequited. So the question became: how can the medium of <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_Message_Service\">SMS</a> be gently subverted to challenge alienation and misunderstanding in text communications, and to free up some mental space?\u201d </p> <p>Working with the technologist Chris Allick, Ahern began creating a project called <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://whenithinkaboutyouitextmyself.com/\">When I Think About You I Text Myself</a> to create a \u201crelational intervention\u201d in the text messaging medium. Rather than send that ill-advised text, you set afloat your tricky little digital boats in the direction of an anonymous phone number \u2013 <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://whenithinkaboutyouitextmyself.com/\">provided online</a> \u2013 which will then automatically send your own words back to you at intervals of three, six, nine and 12 months so you can revisit them privately, safely and with the distance of time. </p> <h2>\u2018You\u2019re depending on a disembodied high\u2019</h2> <p>The project was initially conceived primarily as a work of art rather than a public service. Ahern describes being influenced by the media theorist Marshall McLuhan\u2019s idea of the \u201cself-amputated image\u201d, which describes our relationship to technology. \u201cIn his essay the Gadget Lover, McLuhan uses the myth of <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcissus_(mythology)\">Narcissus</a> to describe \u2018cultural narcosis\u2019, or a numbing loop that is extended between ourselves and the gadgets that \u2018are ourselves\u2019.\u201d </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The youth Narcissus mistook his own reflection in the water for another person. This extension of himself by mirror numbed his perceptions until he became the servomechanism of his own extended or repeated image. Now the point of this myth is the fact that men at once become fascinated by any extension of themselves in any material other than themselves. </p> <p><em>Marshall McLuhan, The Gadget Lover, Understanding Media </em></p> </blockquote> <p>When I Think About You I Text Myself debuted as part of Temporary Highs, an exhibit that ran earlier this summer at the Bitforms Gallery in New York, curated by Lindsay Howard, devoted to \u201c<a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://artforum.com/uploads/guide.003/id24775/press_release.pdf\">how the structure of the internet enables reward-seeking behavior</a>\u201d. Other works in the exhibit dealt with themes such as online shopping, video games, work and drugs. It\u2019s not too much of a stretch to talk about ill-advised texts alongside other self-destructive behaviors. The cycle of impulsivity, instant gratification and then regret brought on by the clarity of a new day is part of the experience. </p> <p>\u201cI thought [Temporary Highs] was the perfect context for the project, because it presented a way to reverse the reward system,\u201d Ahern says. \u201cIf the smartphone causes alienation, communication paralysis and numbness, then I want to challenge that in a way that provokes emotion and creativity \u2026 if you rely on a text message exchange for satisfaction, you\u2019re depending on a disembodied high. There are a lot of stress hormones activated by phone notifications and, in a way, the nervous system is partially hijacked to meeting this new extension of the self.\u201d</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Waiting: tumult of anxiety provoked by waiting for the loved being, subject to trivial delays (rendezvous, letters, telephone calls, returns) <br tabindex=\"-1\"><em tabindex=\"-1\">Roland Barthes, A Lover\u2019s Discourse</em></p> </blockquote> <p>During the first week of When I Think About You I Text Myself, anyone who texted the provided number received responses personally written by Ahern, along with automated, programmed texts designed to prompt the user to express themselves. </p> <p>Although providing each individual text with personal attention wasn\u2019t practically or emotionally sustainable for Ahern, she says it was important to her that the project account for some ambiguity between human and machine. \u201cI learned through testing that people were more likely to communicate [if given] a little bit of feedback, and that they were more likely to quit texting and give up expressing themselves if they felt they were texting into a vacuum,\u201d says Ahern.</p> <h2>\u2018The simplicity was beautiful\u2019</h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>When you talk to a human in 2035, you\u2019ll be talking to someone that\u2019s a combination of biological and nonbiological intelligence</p> <p><em>Ray Kurzweil</em></p> </blockquote> <p>Through Ahern\u2019s project, we learn that knowing we may receive a response is part of the irresistible urge of texting \u2013 even if we don\u2019t know whether the response is coming from a human or a robot, and even when it\u2019s just our own words and feelings reflected back at us at the project\u2019s preordained three-month intervals. She also says she learned from the patterns and commonalities among the messages she received.</p> <p>\u201cMost of the responses were related to love in one way or another. All in all, the most common expression was and is some version of \u2018I miss you\u2019,\u201d Ahern says. \u201cThat simplicity was very beautiful. I heard from people who are harboring secret crushes, falling in love but too afraid to say so, stepping outside their relationship or hoping to get back together with a past love. Some were cathartic, angry or even accusatory. Others were venting at work or family. It seemed like most of these people were using the project as a way to communicate feelings that would otherwise complicate delicate relationships.</p> <p>\u201cThe texts were anonymous, which was helpful in staying objective,\u201d she continues. \u201cThere were times where I thought, Mom, is that you? Or, oh man, is this my ex? But in fact I\u2019ll never know, and most likely, I was seeing that all of our stories aren\u2019t that different.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/mar/09/facebook-social-media-intimacy-human-contact-craving\">Social media mimics the intimacy we yearn for \u2013 but fails to deliver | Chibundu Onuzo</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Ahern says that as an art project, When I Think About You I Text Myself\u2019s primary goal is to invite expression, and anything users share is at their discretion. Participants\u2019 phone numbers are anonymized, texts aren\u2019t shared publicly and all the information is stored in a secure database. </p> <p>\u201cThis hotline should in no way replace the option to reach for a real person. In fact, I hope that it shapes the thoughts and feelings, and provokes authentic communication with real live people, perhaps after some reflection,\u201d Ahern adds. \u201cThis phone number is more like a safe space waiting room for all the pent-up communication.\u201d </p> <p>Next time you can barely contain that text you know you aren\u2019t supposed to send, try Ahern\u2019s hotline instead.

  "<p>It has been 17 years since these sides last met and for Nottingham Forest the reunion was a chastening experience given that Ars\u00e8ne Wenger had effectively put out a reserve side. Arsenal still managed to win with something to spare and the second half was so one-sided it was a stark reminder about the gulf that exists between the higher end of the Premier League and the middle reaches of the Championship.</p> <p>Wenger\u2019s players passed the ball with the kind of elegance that is simply not seen in second-tier football and, in the process, Lucas P\u00e9rez\u2019s confidence should be soothed by the two goals he scored during that period of the match when the away side were at their most dominant. On that basis alone, Wenger can reflect on a satisfactory evening, featuring another spectacular goal from Granit Xhaka and late debuts for Chris Willock and Krystian Bielik, two 18-year-olds from the club\u2019s conveyor belt of young talent.</p> <p>The imbalance was clear from the moment Xhaka struck midway through the first half and when Lucas made it 3-0 after 71 minutes it was almost a surprise they had to wait until the third minute of stoppage time before Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain ran clear to complete the rout. Forest are still waiting for their first clean sheet of Philippe Montanier\u2019s watch and this was the seventh occasion out of 11 that they have conceded two or more. In truth, the ordeal could have been even worse.</p> <p>For Wenger, it was also a victory that justified his team selection and the calculated gamble of starting with only three players aged above 24. He had six teenagers on the bench and, in total, Arsenal\u2019s starting XI and seven substitutes wore shirt numbers totting up to 618.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/20/derby-county-liverpool-efl-cup-third-round-match-report\">Liverpool waltz past Derby as Coutinho and Firmino show their class</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It was clear that Wenger was prioritising the game against Chelsea on Saturday and there was only a brief flurry early on, when Pajtim Kasami made a mess of a presentable chance, when Forest threatened to repeat <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/oct/27/sheffield-wednesday-arsenal-capital-one-cup-match-report\" title=\"\">what Sheffield Wednesday did in this competition last season</a>.</p> <p>\u201cI told the players before the game that we went to Sheffield Wednesday and lost 3-0 because we were not ready mentally for the commitment of the Championship,\u201d Wenger said afterwards. \u201cOur history helped us tonight to start in a much stronger way.\u201d</p> <p>Nicklas Bendtner caused few problems against his old club and Arsenal did not look back after Xhaka let fly midway through the first half. He had shown his ability to strike the ball with power and precision in the 4-1 win at Hull on Saturday. Xhaka was 35 yards out when he swung back his left foot for his latest goal. The shot skimmed off Chris Cohen\u2019s back and, to be generous, that slight deflection might explain why the goalkeeper, Vladimir Stojkovic, appeared to lose the trajectory of the ball. Stojkovic, diving to his right, did get a glove to the ball but without levering it away. The ball dropped in and though it was undoubtedly a fine strike, it was a misjudgment on the part of the Serbia international.</p> <p>To give him his due, Stojkovic had already saved his team in the 12th minute when Chuba Akpom found space in the penalty area to take aim against the club that had him on loan two seasons ago, paying little attention to the fact this was the point of the night when the home supporters were marking the 12th anniversary of Brian Clough\u2019s death.</p> <p>Lucas had been disappointingly peripheral in the first half but the \u00a317m signing was given his chance just before the hour. The referee, Paul Tierney, ruled Michael Mancienne had bundled over Akpom and Lucas was not put off by Stojkovic\u2019s attempts to disrupt his concentration. The goalkeeper had left a larger gap to his right, signalling that was where the Spaniard would put it. Lucas duly obliged but with enough precision that Stojkovic could not reach the shot.</p> <p>Arsenal had complete control and for the rest of the night the home supporters were reminded about the team\u2019s defensive shortcomings. Montanier has a habit of changing his defence for every game and if the Frenchman is to prosper at a club with a remarkably quick turnover of managers, it might be that his back four need a more settled look.</p> <p>Lucas outmuscled Mancienne before the second goal in a straight chase for the ball. Play was waved on and the striker, cutting in from the left, took the ball away from Stojkovic before slipping his shot into an exposed net. \u201cI liked that goal,\u201d Wenger said. \u201cAs well as technique, it showed great determination to win the&#xa0;fight.\u201d</p> <p>After that, the game was little more than an exercise in damage-limitation for Forest and the away end could even serenade Bendtner. The Dane was substituted after the third goal and on his way he must have felt that he, and his new club, had slipped a long way down football\u2019s order of merit.</p>",

  "<p>Ken Loach\u2019s seminal drama Cathy Come Home arrived on our TVs half a century ago, shocking the nation with its depiction of a young couple\u2019s slide into poverty and homelessness.</p> <p> Housing charity Shelter was founded just a few weeks later, but its work to solve an endemic housing crisis is far from over. The key thing that\u2019s changed is the way we conceptualise homelessness, says Kate Webb, Shelter\u2019s head of policy. In the 1960s, homelessness was seen as a personal problem; it wasn\u2019t seen as a housing problem and there was no state duty to rehouse people.</p> <p> But things changed in the decades that followed. First, in the 1960s, came a big council house building programme. This was followed by landmark legislation in the form of the 1977 Housing (Homelessness Persons) Act, which gave local authorities a duty to rehouse families.</p> <p> And yet a new generation of Cathys have nowhere to call home.</p> <p> \u201cWe have a strong legislative safety net in this country, but the problems have come from the housing system itself,\u201d says Webb. Fewer council houses are being built, stocks have been siphoned off by right to buy and deep cuts have left councils struggling to rehouse homeless people.</p> <p> \u201cThe early noughties saw a decline in homelessness and the use of bed and breakfasts for homeless families dropped too, but all that progress has rapidly gone into reverse over the past four or five years,\u201d adds Webb.</p> <p> MPs agree. A report in August from the Commons communities and local government committee said a demonstrable increase in homelessness had pushed the problem to such a level that a renewed, government-wide strategy is needed.</p> <p> The committee found examples of great work, but wide variations in the level of support offered to vulnerable people across the country: \u201cMany people are badly treated by council staff and those who are judged not to be in priority need are often sent away without any meaningful support or guidance.\u201d</p> <p> People have increasingly been forced to turn to the private rented sector. \u201cMemories of post-war slums might have faded, but they\u2019ve been replaced with a new problem \u2013 an insecure and expensive private rented sector,\u201d says Webb. The single biggest driver of homelessness among families today is losing a private tenancy, adds Webb, with cuts to housing benefit dramatically reducing the prospect of private renting for many families on low incomes.</p> <p>Meanwhile, youth homelessness charity Centrepoint, set up in 1969, is seeing growing numbers of young people get stuck in the sort of hostel accommodation it provides. \u201cAs local authorities have their money cut, they\u2019re less generous in helping borderline cases get housing,\u201d says Paul Noblet, head of public affairs at Centrepoint. \u201cEven if a young person can get into full-time work on the national living wage, they struggle to get anything in the private rented sector.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>Terence Crutcher had his hands up. That didn\u2019t stop him from being shot by Tulsa police on Friday. He was a father, a husband, a churchgoing man, a college student at the age of 40.

Bad cops see large-bodied black men like me and they treat us like wild game. Was Crutcher just too big, too scary, too black to live? </p> <p>This kind of thinking is why some of us fear being perceived as forceful or empowered, especially around law enforcement. We try to avoid attributes that any red-blooded American, white male is raised to embrace as a right. For men of color, death \u2013 not trouble with the law \u2013 is the consequence of getting out of line. It\u2019s been that way since the days of colonial slave codes.</p> <p>I know this well. I write in a doughnut shop several days a week. The same police officers, more or less, see me all the time. They always seem to give me an extra look over, each and every time. They have never smiled or said hello or seemed impressed by the mounds of books surrounding me. None have ever stopped to reassure me that they will look out for me or my things. </p> <p>One once warned me that the aspirin I was about to take (clearly marked aspirin) should be consumed or thrown away because I \u201cwould probably be locked up for probable cause of selling drugs\u201d. Every time I stand up to stretch, the length of my body is scanned by their eyes and entire tables of law enforcement turn around to assess if big, black me is a danger. </p> <p>Of course, I want to believe the police are here for me. To believe they will protect me. But nothing in my experience, including getting hauled off a bus to be searched, or having a gun put to my head as an unarmed, immobile passenger in a traffic stop, with a white driver who moved around without restriction, has told me I have a fighting chance if I am the victim of law enforcement overreach.<br></p> <p>You\u2019ve probably heard of \u201cthe talk\u201d African American parents have with their children. But there is another talk I want to have, one which I shared with friends on social media after I learned of this recent police shooting. It\u2019s the talk about what happens if I am ever in Terence Crutcher\u2019s place. </p> <p>Yes, I will do my absolute best not to do anything to be considered \u201cresisting arrest\u201d or \u201cnot following commands\u201d. I will sit stoically and silently. If they ever get their hands on me, I will sit silently until it\u2019s over \u2013 though those who don\u2019t should never be shot. But if they kill me, I hope my friends bear witness that I was not \u201cone bad dude\u201d.</p> <p>I hope people fight for my character.

  "<p>The drive for power leads to deceit. Soon moral ruin comes in its train, then violence, then murder. This cycle of high hopes rolling down to hell in a handcart is probably plot No 2 in literature. (Plot No 1 being girl meets boy, etc.) Corruption of the soul, of the heart, of men, of power, of ideals and idealism has been at the dead centre of so many great books it\u2019s kind of invidious to pick a top 10.

The hero is an ex-IRA man, one of his allies an ex-Mormon CIA man wrestling with his religion. But events in modern Russia inspired it: things I\u2019ve seen with my own eyes from Chechnya to Moscow, from Siberia to Sochi<em>. </em>It\u2019s not about Putin, but while working as a journalist, I\u2019ve met him and three of his critics: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2006/oct/09/guardianobituaries.russia\">Anna Politkovskaya</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/jul/15/chechnya-natalia-estemirova-murdered\">Natasha Estemirova</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/boris-nemtsov\">Boris Nemtsov</a>. They all got murdered, reason enough to dedicate Cold<em> </em>to their memories.<br></p> <p>Below is my idiosyncratic selection of the books that pass two tests: they\u2019re all great reads, and their subjects are rotten to the core.<br></p> <p><strong>1. <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/oxford-shakespeare-the-tragedy-of-macbeth.html\">Macbeth by William Shakespeare</a></strong><br>It still grips me, this play written in 1611 about a Scottish nobleman corrupted by the lust for power who goes on to kill a good king and \u2013 to secure his grip on the throne \u2013 keeps on killing. Rereading Macbeth, you get the flavour of what it must be like to be at the court of Kim Jong-un in Pyongyang, or of Caliph Al-Baghdadi in Isisland: \u201cIt will have blood, they say; blood will have blood.\u201d</p> <p><strong>2. <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/darkness-at-noon.html\">Darkness at Noon by Arthur Koestler</a><br></strong>The outstanding novel about how the Russian revolution became twisted by Stalinism. It\u2019s great literature, but at its heart is the corruption of a human soul, as the great revolutionary Rubashov allows himself to be ruined \u2013 and ruin others he loves \u2013 to serve an ideal. When people rot, Koestler tells us, they do so from within.<strong tabindex=\"-1\"><br tabindex=\"-1\"></strong></p> <p><strong>3. <a href=\"http://www.screenplay.com/downloads/scripts/Chinatown.pdf\">Chinatown by Robert Towne</a><br></strong>Picking a screenplay is a cheat. Yeah, but it\u2019s Chinatown. To me, this is the defining work of art about the corruption that is the essence of LA; the living, breathing, pulsing dishonesty of Tinseltown. At the dead centre of the American Dream is a lie, a city built on wrongdoing. When power indulges in murder, hypocrisy and paedophilia, the forces of law and order don\u2019t just look the other way, they entrap the honest detective. He ends up with slit nostrils. The helplessness of ordinary people in the face of corrupt entitlement has never been better told.</p> <p><strong>4. <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/boys-in-zinc.html\">Zinky Boys: Soviet Voices from the Afghan War by Svetlana Alexievich</a><br></strong>The 2015 Nobel laureate\u2019s stunning work on the Soviet agony in Afghanistan is simply written but no less profound for that. She tells the stories of individual soldiers and Soviet citizens, in Kabul and elsewhere, coming to realise that the ideals of fraternity and solidarity the old men in Moscow spout are toxic. It\u2019s a lament for a noble idealism that turned sick. The boys were sent home in zinc coffins \u2013 hence the title.</p> <p><strong>5. <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/bare-faced-messiah-the-true-story-of-l-ron-hubbard.html\">Bare-Faced Messiah by Russell Miller</a><br></strong>This extraordinary biography of L Ron Hubbard tells the gobsmacking truth about the greatest conman of the 20th century, a title for which there\u2019s a lot of competition. Miller considers Scientology\u2019s boasts about their founder and on critical examination, all of it \u2013 that L Ron was a war hero, an explorer, a nuclear scientist (and not a bigamist) \u2013 turns to dust.

In this reworking of the Knights of the Round Table, Mordred is the city\u2019s immoral rich, his thanes bent cops and smooth-talking, grey-suited mobsters. A corrupt city has never been so skilfully drawn. </p> <p><strong>8. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fromthearchive/story/0,,1078193,00.html\">Maxwell: The Rise and Fall of Robert Maxwell and His Empire by Roy Greenslade</a><br></strong>The sickly sweet corruption of journalists in thrall to an ogre from a medieval fairy story, Greenslade\u2019s account of the madness of those under the monstrous whim of King Bob is hilarious and tragic, both at the same time.

When the Nazis rescued Mussolini, Ciano was shot in the back on the orders of the old man. But his diaries record Italy\u2019s descent from corruption into something far worse, providing posterity a window into Mussolini\u2019s dark soul.</p> <p><strong>10. <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/unravelling-413469.html\">The Unravelling by Emma Sky</a><br></strong>Sky, a punky, anti-war English liberal, provides a ringside seat from within the US military to the aftermath of the invasion of Iraq and the moral quagmire into which the west\u2019s great warriors sank.

Rather than ruthlessly casting him on to the scrapheap and talking to Guardiola behind his back, which appears to be the impression in Seluk\u2019s parallel universe, City were actually quite generous to the Chilean. A truly ruthless club would have parted with Pellegrini after his trophyless second season; instead they ended talk of a dead man walking <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/aug/07/manchester-city-manuel-pellegrini-new-contract\" title=\"\">by awarding him a contract extension</a>.

In the end Pellegrini was given a generous three years to make a case for his retention at the club \u2013 admittedly he would have had to achieve something astounding to deflect City from their pursuit of Guardiola \u2013 and most people apart from a Ukrainian agent with an axe to grind recognise he fell somewhat short of the mark.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9f449c0a3c4b0f8308f979eb5210fac8ba0810c8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9f449c0a3c4b0f8308f979eb5210fac8ba0810c8/0_216_5568_3341/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Yaya Tour\u00e9\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Manchester City have moved on and no one is clamouring for Yaya Tour\u00e9, in action here against Steaua Bucharest in August, to return to the side.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anthony Devlin/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Tour\u00e9, on the other hand, can be seen as a victim. He has been frozen out, has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/24/manchester-city-steaua-bucharest-champions-league-match-report\" title=\"\">played only one game this season</a> and has now arrived at a diplomatic impasse. It is easy to say his limbo will be a fairly comfortable one on around \u00a3225,000 per week, though at 33 he will want to play and as his contract is up at the end of the season his agent probably needs him to play. So instead of escalating the argument \u2013 Seluk has just claimed Guardiola needs to try managing a club such as Sunderland before he can consider himself a top manager \u2013 it might be an idea for the Tour\u00e9 camp to calm down and confront the reality that this particular ace has been trumped.</p> <p>Had Guardiola simply regarded Tour\u00e9 as a bolshy dressing-room character that he would be better off without, as Seluk suggests, he would most likely have been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/31/joe-hart-torino-excited-test-serie-a-transfer-window-manchester-city\" title=\"\">bundled out the door with Joe Hart</a>. It was always going to be interesting to discover how Guardiola would renew his relationship with a player he first dealt with at Barcelona, but initially at least the club seemed prepared to keep the door open. Tour\u00e9 was assured he would have a role to play, though possibly not one that involved a game every week.</p> <p>Does that count as humiliation? It depends on how entitled you feel. Even towards the end of Pellegrini\u2019s reign there were clear signs that Tour\u00e9 no longer held the influence he once did, and given his age and contractual situation he has to be realistic about his first-team chances at a major club, which is what City have just become. City the wannabe club might have worn the Ivorian for a little longer, but City with Guardiola at the helm are a different proposition, as their eight wins from the first eight games of the season have shown. City this season no longer miss Sergio Ag\u00fcero when he is unavailable, never mind Tour\u00e9.</p> <p>Guardiola <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jun/02/manchester-city-confirm-signing-ilkay-gundogan-borussia-dortmund\" title=\"\">has brought in Ilkay G\u00fcndogan</a> to notable effect, stiffening and adding creativity to a midfield that already includes Kevin De Bruyne, David Silva and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/12/raheem-sterling-pep-guardiola-manchester-city\" title=\"\">a rejuvenated Raheem Sterling</a>, and the upshot has been that Tour\u00e9\u2019s absence has gone unnoticed. The team has moved on. No one has been wondering when Tour\u00e9 will be back, much less clamouring for his return. This happens in top-level football, even to players originally brought in for their stature and experience. Rather than fretting about Tour\u00e9\u2019s place in the scheme of things this season, most City supporters have been trying to work out where on earth Leroy San\u00e9 and, ultimately, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/21/gabriel-jesus-manchester-city-palmeiras-brazil-interview\" title=\"\">Gabriel Jesus</a>, are going to fit in.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/21/gabriel-jesus-manchester-city-palmeiras-brazil-interview\">Gabriel Jesus: \u2018I like a challenge. The biggest battles go to the biggest warriors\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Even in the unlikely event of Seluk and his player making a public apology to Guardiola on the steps of Manchester Town Hall it seems doubtful that Tour\u00e9 would get more than a handful of minor games in his final campaign, so the possibility exists that these noises off will continue for the rest of the season. Undignified, of course, but Guardiola has made his position clear and, though Seluk might not notice it from his continental base, the Spaniard\u2019s demand for more respect has attracted widespread support. Partly because Seluk is perceived to have overstepped the mark on previous occasions, partly because Guardiola has so clearly moved City forward.</p> <p>A mere five games into the Premier League season and the eagerly anticipated power struggle between the two Manchester clubs is already looking like a mismatch. Guardiola can do no wrong, whereas Jos\u00e9 Mourinho appears to be wilfully making every mistake in the book, blaming his players, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/20/manchester-united-jose-mourinho-criticism-luke-shaw-efl-cup-northampton\" title=\"\">criticising individuals</a> and making promises to Wayne Rooney that he subsequently finds difficult to keep. Those of us who suggested Manchester United might win the title did so because Mourinho is a proven winner in England, whereas Guardiola might struggle with the enormity of the task at City in his first season in a new country. So far, it has not worked out that way. Mourinho is already looking as short of ideas and inspiration as he did at Chelsea last year, while Guardiola sails serenely on, the notion of City turning themselves into a new version of Barcelona no longer an idle fantasy.</p> <p>Guardiola is even winning the public relations war. Before picking a fight with Tour\u00e9\u2019s agent he cheekily dismissed United as a long-ball team with the choice observation that Bournemouth were the best side City had played all season. That might soon change \u2013 Barcelona crop up next month \u2013 but whereas last season that prospect would have terrified City, now they appear to be up for any challenge. Not even Tour\u00e9 and Seluk could disagree, though don\u2019t bank on it.</p>",

  "<p></p> <p>Navarinou Park \u2013 part playground, part open-air cinema, part vegetable garden and verdant oasis \u2013 was never meant to be. On that, all of its participants agree. Stavros Stavrides, a professor of architecture at Athens\u2019 National Technical University, is the first to say it; so, too, do the local residents who, spade in hand, also worked to transform an unprepossessing parking lot on the rim of Athens\u2019 edgy Exarcheia district into a vibrant community garden.</p> <p>\u201cWho\u2019d have thought?\u201d asks Effie Saroglou, a dancer, walking her dark-haired mutt around the park. \u201cWho\u2019d have imagined us ever sitting here?\u201d says Yannis Mandris, a musician, watching a grainy rendition of Blade Runner in a makeshift arena on the other side of the lot. Something is stirring in the Greek capital \u2013 and in more ways than one Navarinou Park has come to represent it. </p> <p>Stavrides calls it a movement, a new form of commons in which public-spirited individuals reclaim public space; others an informal urbanism born of a spirit of solidarity that has taken hold since Europe\u2019s economic crisis erupted in Greece in 2009. For in Navarinou \u2013 a place run by neighbourhood committee \u2013 citizens have sought new ways of overcoming the trauma of economic collapse. And they have done so by creating a place where, self-contained and seemingly beyond the reach of authority, they can meet, converse, play and produce food.</p> <p>Bereft of civic protection and the great umbrella of the welfare state, grassroots groups across Athens have followed suit. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5bc67becbf6bfefa089cb41415f6140491784732\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5bc67becbf6bfefa089cb41415f6140491784732/0_149_4200_2520/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Navarinou Park hosts a \u2018community kitchen event\u2019 in 2011, organised to help out those hit hardest by the financial crisis.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Navarinou Park hosts a \u2018community kitchen event\u2019 in 2011, organised to help out those hit hardest by the financial crisis.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Louisa Gouliamaki/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWhat we are witnessing is an explosion of social networks born of bottom-up initiatives,\u201d says Stavrides, who was among the activists whose spontaneous efforts stopped the lot being turned into a parking space in late 2009. \u201cNavarinou heralded this new culture, this new spirit of people taking their lives into their own hands. They know that they can no longer expect the state to support them and through this process, they are discovering how important it is to share.\u201d</p> <p>It is a movement that has confounded expectation. Greece is both an anarchic and a self-absorbed nation, where notions of civil society have never been strong. Instead, individualism has always burned bright.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The crisis has made a lot of Greeks want to work together.</p> <footer> <cite>Lydia Carras</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But the crisis, first glimpsed in the <em>esprit de rage </em>of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/dec/14/greece\">the December 2008 street riots</a> that followed the police shooting of a teenage boy only streets away from Navarinou Park, has turned that on its head.</p> <p>Increasingly, local associations, resident committees and solidarity groups are forging ties, exchanging know-how, giving shape to new concepts of co-existence, and in so doing, reshaping public space. </p> <p>\u201cThe crisis has made a lot of Greeks want to work together,\u201d says Lydia Carras, who oversees the long-established Elliniki Etairia Society for the Environment and Cultural Heritage from a building at the foot of the Acropolis. \u201cThere is a new mood of cooperation because people understand that the only way to get their voice heard is to make alliances.\u201d</p> <p>If Navarinou provides a compelling example of neighbourhood revitalisation, it is not the only one.

For those reasons, the court considers that the UK has failed to fulfil its obligations under the directive and orders the UK to pay the commission\u2019s costs.\u201d</p> <p>In a joint report, Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth said Aberthaw belonged to a different era. \u201cOn average, pollution from Aberthaw is responsible for curtailing the lives of 67 people in Wales every year. This is equivalent to 64% of the death toll on Welsh roads, yet there is no special strategy for securing the accelerated final closure of the plant.</p> <p>\u201cThe emissions from the power plant are estimated to be responsible for 195,000 days of illness per year, including 35,000 days of sick leave. On an average day, 530 people are ill due to the harmful health impacts of the pollution.</p> <p>\u201cThe fact that its pollution has been causing respiratory sickness and prematurely ending the lives of thousands upon thousands of people in Wales and beyond for decades has eluded scrutiny.</p> <p>\u201cThe Welsh and UK governments must do everything in their power to ensure that Aberthaw power station ceases operating. For good\u201d.</p> <p>Mike Childs, the head of science, policy and research at Friends of the Earth, said: \u201cThis is a vindicating decision. The pollution from Aberthaw is unacceptable for the people near the power station in south Wales, but detrimental effects are felt as far away as Exeter, Bristol, Swindon and Bournemouth. We need a full and permanent closure, and today\u2019s decision should help bring that about. It is the only sensible solution unless we are prepared to accept premature deaths and children\u2019s ill health as a reasonable price to pay for corporate profit.\u201d</p> <p>Rebecca Williams, the climate and energy specialist at WWF-UK said: \u201cThis judgment is yet another nail in the coffin for the UK\u2019s dirty old coal-power stations.

Yet a thread links his lynching to current battles over inequality, labour mobilisation and blue collar representation.</p> <p>\u201cThe history of labour in America and the fight for recognition was much, much bloodier than Europe\u2019s,\u201d said Arnon Gutfeld, a historian who worked in Montana\u2019s mines and investigated Little\u2019s murder. \u201cViolence is as American as cherry pie.\u201d </p> <p>Little grew up in the twilight of the Gilded Age. Corporate titans known as robber barons amassed fortunes on the backs of workers who toiled for meagre pay in difficult conditions. Grand mansions co-existed with homeless camps known as hobo jungles. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Violence is as American as cherry pie</p> <footer> <cite>Arnon Gutfeld</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Little, the son of a Quaker and, according to Stead, part Cherokee, is thought to have been born in Oklahoma in 1879. After a stint as a miner he joined the Industrial Workers of the World (<a href=\"http://www.iww.org/content/about-iww\">IWW</a>), a radical labour union known as the Wobblies. The nickname\u2019s origin is unclear but the organisation\u2019s goal gleamed bright: a revolution to let workers \u2013 in fields, farms and mines \u2013 keep what they produced.</p> <p>The IWW\u2019s leaders and intellectuals \u2013 socialists, anarchists and Marxists \u2013 were based in Chicago but Little criss-crossed hamlets, towns and cities in western states, agitating, recruiting and evangelising with little more than the clothes on his back, oratorical power and a fearlessness bordering on suicidal.</p> <p>He preached to fruit pickers, lumberjacks, oil drillers and miners, urging them to strike for better pay and conditions and if necessary to impede \u2013 to sabotage \u2013 production. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"de51f4a6815480f5088187a0d06c549010432de2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/de51f4a6815480f5088187a0d06c549010432de2/0_48_640_384/500.jpg\" alt=\"Reverse view of Frank Little\u2019s grave in Butte, Montana\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Reverse view of Frank Little\u2019s grave in Butte, Montana</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rory Carroll/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He drew crowds by standing on street corners reading the Declaration of Independence. He appealed not just to white working men but women, blacks, latinos and hobos, insisting they had common cause.</p> <p>Business owners hated and feared Little. Newspapers denounced him and police jailed him. When that didn\u2019t work, hired thugs beat him up \u2013 but that didn\u2019t work either. Little was the \u201chobo agitator\u201d, fighting for freedom of speech and catching trains to flashpoints in Washington, California, New Mexico, anywhere where he could stir things up. </p> <p>The US\u2019s entry into the first world war in April 1917 raised the stakes. Patriotic hysteria swept the country. The Espionage Act virtually criminalised any opposition as treachery. IWW leaders opposed the war but hesitated to say so publicly. Little, in contrast, by then a board member, branded it a capitalist slaughter-fest for which no worker should die. When soldiers rounded up hundreds of striking Arizona mine workers in June 1917, an enraged Little denounced the troops as scabs.</p> <p>Weeks later he headed north to America\u2019s industrial crucible: Butte. The Montana town sat atop \u201cthe richest hill on Earth\u201d, a font of copper which drew tens of thousands of miners. It had been known as the Gibraltar of Unionism, with powerful unions and a socialist mayor. But by 1917 the aptly named Anaconda company, a global player, was crushing organised labour. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In retrospect it was a death foretold, but Little ignored warnings.</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It controlled employment, newspapers, police, politicians and for good measure had a militia, said Gutfeld, the professor. \u201cIn many respects Montana at that time was a colony of the Anaconda company. If you wanted to commit suicide you went out against the company.\u201d</p> <p>A horrific accident in June 1917 killed 168 miners, infuriating survivors and giving the IWW, Little hoped, a chance to recruit. He arrived on 18 July. He was 38 and a physical wreck \u2013 thin, ill, a broken leg in a cast. Even so, he gave a barnstorming address to miners. He spoke with \u201cmaniacal fury\u201d and \u201cpractically threatened the United States government with revolution\u201d, the pro-company Butte Miner newspaper reported. For two weeks Little kept at it, urging miners to strike and \u201cfight the capitalists but not the Germans\u201d.</p> <p>Newspapers demanded authorities crack down \u201cwithout gloves\u201d on such \u201csedition\u201d and \u201ctreasonable tirades\u201d. In retrospect it was a death foretold, but Little ignored warnings. Maybe he thought he would escape with just a beating. Maybe he knew what was coming. \u201cIt would be better to go down slugging,\u201d he had told colleagues. </p> <p>There were no witnesses to the abduction besides Byrne, the boarding house owner. And there were no known witnesses to the lynching. A man called Robert Brown on his way to work found the body swinging from the trestle some time after dawn. Pinned to the underwear was a placard: \u201cOthers take notice, first and last warning, 3-7-77.\u201d</p> <p>Rumours swirl to this day: that Little was castrated, stabbed 27 times and lost his kneecaps; that the numbers referred to his draft number, or Montana\u2019s grave specifications, three feet wide, seven feet deep, 77 inches long; that he was killed by union rivals, or a patriotic mob.</p> <p>The grisly details, said Jane Little Botkin, are exaggerations. He was savagely beaten and tortured but didn\u2019t lose body parts and was likely unconscious when hanged. \u201cI believe they put him on top of the car and drove the car out from underneath him. He didn\u2019t struggle. He was strangled, the neck did not break. \u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"210cd7a85137fb0d9ec4172b4c3954abccaa4e84\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/210cd7a85137fb0d9ec4172b4c3954abccaa4e84/15_354_5882_3530/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The funeral procession for Frank Little.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The funeral procession for Frank Little.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Walter P Reuther Library, Archives of Labor and Urban Affairs, Wayne State University</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Little Botkin, more than anyone, should know. The activist\u2019s great grandniece, she has spent seven years combing official archives and plumbing family lore for a biography, Frank Little and the IWW: the Blood That Stained an American Family, due out next year. The retired teacher believes the numbers refer to a warning to vagrants to buy a $3 train ticket for a 7am stagecoach, as ordered by a purported secret committee of 77 men in Helena, Montana.</p> <p>Little Botkin and other historians agree the killers most likely worked for Anaconda. The company had armed thugs, private detectives and police officers on its payroll. Which would explain why the official murder investigation went nowhere. </p> <p>There is a literary sub-plot. In his youth<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/sep/29/100-best-novels-the-maltese-falcon-dashiell-hammett-sam-spade-raymond-chandler\"> Dashiell Hammett</a>, who created the fictional detective Sam Spade, worked for the Pinkerton detective agency, which specialised in strike breaking. Hammett\u2019s first novel, Red Harvest, concerns a labour dispute set in a thinly veiled version of Butte. </p> <p>In her memoirs Lillian Hellman, Hammett\u2019s companion, said he told her he was offered $5,000 to murder Little. \u201cThrough the years he was to repeat that bribe offer so many times that I came to believe \u2026 that it was a kind of key to his life. He had given a man the right to think he would commit murder.\u201d</p> <p>Some have speculated the novelist actually did it. <a href=\"https://www.fantasticfiction.com/n/william-f-nolan/\">William Nolan</a>, one of Hammett\u2019s biographers, thinks not. \u201cHe didn\u2019t do it but the fact that someone even asked him, thinking that he would be that kind of person, and that he was that deep into the thing made him feel guilty. He never got over and it always haunted him.\u201d Hammett subsequently became a communist and ended up on a McCarthyite blacklist.<br></p> <p>Little\u2019s murder initially provoked flurries of defiance. Thousands attended the funeral and sang La Marseillaise. Protests flickered across the west. </p> <p>But instead of galvanising the movement, the lynching presaged a government crackdown: federal troops in Butte, martial law in Spokane, the Federal Sedition act of 1918 and the arrest of 165 alleged IWW members, resulting in jail terms of five to 20 years. \u201cThe wounded IWW ... seemed to lose all of its old dash, all of its genius for improvising guerrilla tactics,\u201d noted the historian Robert Tyler.</p> <p>Members of Little\u2019s family were arrested, terrifying the family into decades of silence, said Little Botkin. \u201cIf you had Frank\u2019s photo on you that could be sedition. We had no photos of him, not one. The family just stopped talking about him.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>His death signalled the end of the only truly radical and in some ways truly effective union of the time.</p> <footer> <cite>Arnold Stead</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>A movement which had mobilised the homeless and taught workers to take direct action never recovered, said Stead, the biographer. \u201cHis death signalled the end of the only truly radical and in some ways truly effective union of the time.\u201d </p> <p>Stead sees a continuum through the evolution \u2013 and weakening \u2013 of US unions. Instead of a wide movement infusing white, black and Latino workers with a shared class identity, unions narrowed and moderated their goals, seeking gains only for dues-paying members. </p> <p>Arguably this was a sensible, successful tack which benefited members. But globalisation and anti-union laws gradually drained their power. Only one in 10 American workers now belong to a union despite stagnant wages and widening inequality. </p> <p>Which brings us to Trump.</p> <p>In the absence of powerful unions, or a shared identity with the working poor of other races, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/14/opinion/sunday/the-decline-of-unions-and-the-rise-of-trump.html?_r=0\">blue collar white men are Trump\u2019s strongest supporters</a>. \u201cThey feel angry and left out so it\u2019s no surprise now that you have people willing to support someone who doesn\u2019t give a damn about them,\u201d said Stead.</p> <p>For CW Copeland, a Montana member of the IWW, which still limps on, the fault lies not just with unions but also the Democratic party and progressive academics. They neglected labour issues, he said. \u201cA lot of those going crazy for Donald Trump identify more with their whiteness than with their class. If more people knew about Frank Little \u2026 I think you\u2019d have fewer voting for Trump.\u201d</p> <p>Perhaps.

Already he has introduced the reader to his troubled relationship with a Dutch-Irish father unable to escape a succession of blue-collar jobs \u2013 bus driver, prison guard, factory worker \u2013 in a nondescript part of New Jersey. It is in this harsh, cold, ungiving man that Springsteen locates the origin of his own flaws and fears.</p> <p>\u201cAs a boy, I figured it was just the way men were, distant, uncommunicative, busy with the currents of the grown-up world.\u201d And angry. At the wheel of a car, \u201cI would use speed and recklessness to communicate my own rage \u2026 with the sole purpose of terrorising my rider.

I\u2019ve always believed the E Street Band\u2019s continued existence is partially due to the fact that there was little to no role confusion among its members. My bandmates were not always happy with the decisions I made and may have been angered by some of them, but nobody debated my right to make them.\u201d</p> <p>The book is as rich in anecdote and detail as in anguish and doubt. He opens by describing his 10-year-old self accompanying his grandfather to scavenge in rubbish tips for broken radio sets that can be repaired and sold to black workers in summer migrant camps. He talks about his experience as an altar boy with a Catholicism that surely encouraged his underlying sense of guilt and obligation (\u201cI don\u2019t often participate in my religion but I know somewhere, deep inside, I\u2019m still on the team\u201d).

There\u2019s another who broke his heart in the days before success struck: \u201cA drug-taking, hell-raising wild child who played by nobody\u2019s rules.

Discretion and the feelings of others don\u2019t allow it.\u201d The exceptions to the code of romantic anonymity are his two wives: the actor and model Julianne Phillips, whom he married in 1985; and the singer Patti Scialfa, with whom he took up when the first marriage was faltering and with whom he now has three grown-up children.

The sentimental stuff about his kids could have been tightened up and the occasional splurges of capital letters and exclamation marks require understanding as an attempt to reproduce on the page the comic melodrama of his on-stage storytelling.

  "<p>Police officers are to be given more training to protect victims of domestic abuse from controlling and coercive behaviour after the College of Policing found that damaging abuse was going undetected due to a lack of police understanding.</p> <p>Under a new <a href=\"http://www.college.police.uk/News/College-news/Pages/Police-support-victims-of-coercive-control.aspx\">pilot scheme run by the college</a>, officers from three forces will be trained to look out for patterns of coercive abuse and controlling behaviour that can lead to long-term psychological injury.</p> <p>It comes after research by the College of Policing warned that unless frontline understanding of the problem improved, high-risk cases would \u201cslip under the radar\u201d. It found that officers focused too much on physical violence and failed to spot signs and patterns of coercive behaviour. </p> <p>It also follows a freedom of information request, which revealed that a new law protecting victims was used <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/aug/31/police-failing-to-use-new-law-against-coercive-domestic-abuse\">just 62 times in the first six months since it was introduced</a>. </p> <p>The legislation is aimed at tackling a range of behaviours, including controlling victims through social media, spying on them online or stopping them from socialising. </p> <p>David Tucker, head of crime and criminal justice at the College of Policing, said the pilot was aimed at fostering a more \u201cnuanced and understanding approach\u201d to the history of abuse encountered by frontline police.<br></p> <p>Speaking on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme he said: \u201cWhat we want to do is equip officers to look beyond the initial incident, to understand what\u2019s gone on before ... that might be an indicator of risk in the future.\u201d</p> <p>Dr Amanda Robinson, a reader in criminology at Cardiff University who conducted the research for College of Policing, said: \u201cOur research showed very clearly that we need to embed an understanding of coercive control more centrally and explicitly with a risk-led approach to domestic abuse.\u201d</p> <p>The research said: \u201cA tendency for the police to focus on physical violence and what has occurred at the current incident can result in them missing abuse which is characterised not by physical violence and injury but by continuous coercion and control in other forms.\u201d</p> <p>It identified problems with a 27-item checklist that officers use when dealing with victims. It found that the checklist known as Dash (domestic abuse, stalking and harassment and honour-based violence) \u201cmay not be appropriate or proportionate\u201d for some incidents of domestic abuse. It found that officers were often failing to use the form largely because of a \u201clack of understanding of coercive control and not considering the history and context of a case\u201d.</p> <p>Robinson said changes to the checklist, to be tested in the pilot, would \u201cget officers to ask the right questions framed more explicitly at seeking to identify whether coercive control is taking place\u201d.</p> <p>Polly Neate, chief executive of Women\u2019s Aid, welcomed the initiative. She said: \u201cIt is vital that officers have a thorough understanding of coercive control and consistent training available to them, so they are able to understand how domestic abuse perpetrators behave and read abusive situations accordingly.\u201d</p>",

The Iraqis he said \u201chave among the largest oil reserves in the world, in the entire world\u201d. Iraq is estimated to have the fifth biggest reserves, but the bulk of that oil is not under Isis\u2019s control.<br></p> <p>\u201cThe territory that [Isis] holds just does not have much oil under it,\u201d said Jim Krane, an energy studies fellow at Rice University\u2019s Baker Institute for Public Policy in Houston. \u201cIn Iraq, most of the Iraq oil reserves are in the far south, around the Persian Gulf. There is some in the Kurdish north, but the Kurds swept in and took that area near Kirkuk.<br></p> <p>\u201cSyria is not a big oil producer,\u201d Krane added. \u201cIt produced 400,000 barrels a day before the war. And 27,000 barrels in 2015. That is minuscule. There is not a lot of oil production that [Isis] controls. When oil was $100 a barrel, that was one thing, but nowadays it\u2019s not a lucrative business.\u201d </p> <p>The US military has already targeted Isis\u2019s small-scale oil refineries and oil convoys as a way of cutting off that income, but Trump clearly has something else in mind \u2013 actually seizing the oil fields with troops. </p> <p>\u201cWe would leave a certain group behind and you would take various sections where they have the oil,\u201d he said at the forum.</p> <p>That \u201ccertain group\u201d would have to be pretty big to hold and protect the oil fields, according to Chris Harmer, a former navy officer and naval aviator, and now a military analyst.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSqPTiZES8A\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/gSqPTiZES8A?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>\u201cIt would take close to 100,000 troops plus the equipment, the airborne patrols, to secure the oilfields and extract the oil,\u201d Harmer said. \u201cTheoretically it would suck up all the deployable assets we have. Forget about the Pacific, forget about Africa. They would just have one purpose \u2013 sucking up oil assets in the Middle East.\u201d </p> <p>The military footprint would have to be even larger to actually get the oil out. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It's hard to overstate the stupidity of this idea \u2026 Seizing Iraq\u2019s oil would make our allies against Isis our enemies</p> <footer> <cite>Jay Hakes</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cYou\u2019d have to occupy most of Syria to get the oil out of the country, since the Syrian export pipelines travel from the oilfields in eastern Syria all the way to the Mediterranean coast, right across the central breadth of the country,\u201d Krane said. </p> <p>\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t do you much good to just capture the oilfields. If you wanted to steal the oil, it would take a full military occupation of Syria to control the full length of the pipelines, so you could move the oil to market. At a minimum, that would mean occupying the city of Homs in central Syria, as well as the main Syrian oil terminals at Banias and Tartus. All that is in addition to occupying rebel-held areas such as Deir ez-Zour where the oilfields lie.\u201d</p> <p>Nor would be it be an in-and-out deployment. When he says \u201ctake the oil\u201d, Trump clearly has the reserves in mind.

  "<p>Google\u2019s new messaging app, Allo, is just a bit snoopier than the company promised it would be back in May.</p> <p>The app is already viewed with suspicion by many privacy advocates, because its integration with Google\u2019s new AI assistant (called, imaginatively, Assistant) requires messages to be sent without end-to-end encryption on by default. That means Google\u2019s Assistant can read your messages, and provide contextual aid \u2013 but it also means Google can read them, and so too can law enforcement, national security and anyone else with a valid warrant.</p> <p>But as a spoonful of sugar to help that go down, the company <a href=\"http://www.theverge.com/2016/5/18/11699122/google-allo-messaging-app-announced-io-2016\">also announced back in May</a> that Allo would have some of the most progressive message retention policies of any app: rather than keeping your texts forever, they would instead be stored \u201ctransiently\u201d, ensuring that your full chat logs aren\u2019t sitting on Google\u2019s servers forever, and anonymously, so that even if the logs are subpoenaed, they can\u2019t be linked back to the sender.</p> <p>Now that Allo is in app stores, those features appear to be missing in action. By default, messages are stored indefinitely, and linked directly to an account.</p> <p>To be clear, the defaults can be changed: both end-to-end encryption and ephemeral messages can be turned on by the user as part of the app\u2019s Incognito mode. That mode also disables access to Google Assistant, for obvious reasons. Previously sent messages can also be deleted manually.</p> <p>Google says that the ephemerality was removed from the shipped version to improve the \u201csmart reply\u201d feature on Allo, which learns from your previous conversations to suggest automatic replies to the latest message sent.

  "<p>I\u2019m still struggling to process it. I don\u2019t understand why it happened, or what it means; its purpose eludes me. The whole thing defies explanation; I frequently find myself attempting to rationalise it, to find sense and reason in it, but I cannot.</p> <p>All I can do is present the facts. On Saturday, at 12.26pm <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/noel-edmonds\" title=\"\">Noel Edmonds</a> phoned me up and then proceeded to talk to my cat, offering her words of affirmation and motivation. And it confirmed what I had long suspected: that Edmonds is a man whom we should all seek to emulate.</p> <p>The call was not unsolicited: a few days previously, I had <a href=\"http://noel.world/phone-a-pet/\" title=\"\">filled in a form</a> on his website, promoting his phone-A-pet service. But that does not mean the call was expected. I had submitted my details, and those of my cat, out of curiosity.

Before long, the phone was placed beside the hairy ears of the cat, while Edmonds offered reassurance and hope. And that, bar one tense moment when I expressed reservations about certain species of beard (I had momentarily forgotten the most famous feature of the man I was talking to), was that.</p> <p>There will be some who will view the entire episode not so much as Edmonds calling a cat, but as Edmonds calling for help. After all, here is a man who was once the Sultan of Saturday, spending years entertaining the nation of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtQXLmkeOgo\" title=\"\">a Saturday morning</a>, and then spending years and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Goksk4YCINs\" title=\"\">years and years entertaining</a> the nation of a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4bew9rVyNE\" title=\"\">Saturday evening</a>.

Unlike them, it\u2019s never been entirely clear what he does, what particular talent he possesses. He\u2019s not what one might call an entertainer; he isn\u2019t renowned for his wit; he\u2019s not an actor; he\u2019s not known for his expertise on any particular subject, or for his sporting ability. Nor is he a broadcaster as such; he\u2019s not a Wogan, still less a Dimbleby. It\u2019s impossible to imagine what he might have done with his life had he been born in a different age.</p> <p>Luckily for us, however, we need not dwell on such hypotheticals. Because all that matters is that he has no equal when it comes to presenting live light entertainment on television. Should the set collapse and the lights go out, you know he\u2019d somehow keep going, a steady companion on the other side of the screen. Even on Brass Eye, when he was hoaxed into warning the young about the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbEfOsYTq0s\" title=\"\">dangers of a pretend narcotic</a>, he conducted himself with a cultured professionalism, amending a script he then delivered so naturally that viewers may have ended up wondering whether the \u201cmade-up drug\u201d Cake might be real after all and the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Morris_(satirist)\" title=\"\">joke might actually be on Chris Morris</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d03e930b45e48616389c98e8c593c1b187040241\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d03e930b45e48616389c98e8c593c1b187040241/0_153_2944_1766/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Noel Edmonds and Mr Blobby in 1994.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Our age is blighted by irony and self-consciousness and a desire to label people.

  "<p>If you\u2019ve glanced at the ads for Simba, Eve or Casper, you\u2019d be forgiven for thinking they were flogging some kind of new gadget. They have the aesthetic of tech startups everywhere, tout the research and development that went into their sparkly new products, and offer eye-catching, venture capital-funded deals. If you look more closely, however, you\u2019ll see they\u2019re actually selling mattresses.</p> <p>But why would companies selling foam, springs and fabric be posturing as Silicon Valley brands? The answer is mattress-selling has changed.</p> <p>At the heart of the ad battle is a three-way fight between companies all promising to use the latest technology to both produce and sell you a mattress. British startups Simba and Eve are taking on each other, as well as the better-funded American competitor Casper, in a war of words, technology, and a lot of billboards.</p> <p>To be clear, these companies aren\u2019t selling \u201csmart mattresses\u201d. Those exist, made by companies like <a href=\"https://www.restperformance.com/\">ReST</a> and <a href=\"http://itbed.sleepnumber.com/\">Sleep Number</a>, and are your classic internet of things devices that can record things like your sleep patterns and automatically adjust the firmness of the mattress to help you get a better night. Instead, the mattresses sold by these new startups are, well, mattresses.</p> <p>Nonetheless, Jas Bagniewski, the chief executive of Eve, says his firm sees itself as a technology company. \u201cWhether you think of the technology in the website, the technology used to compress the mattresses for postage, or the technology of the ERP [enterprise resource planning] system that links the warehousing to the stock control,\u201d he says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ee47f2d98dd618f81be4e6338c007f3c167c5ba7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ee47f2d98dd618f81be4e6338c007f3c167c5ba7/0_0_1113_560/1000.jpg\" alt=\"One of Eve\u2019s tube adverts.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"503\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">One of Eve\u2019s London underground adverts.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Eve</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He likens it to Amazon a decade ago, or his previous employer, the e-commerce site Zolando: just selling things online doesn\u2019t necessarily make you a tech firm, but if you do it with a sufficiently innovative approach, you can be one, even if what you sell isn\u2019t technology itself.</p> <p>Bagniewski concedes that it\u2019s \u201ca stretch\u201d to call Eve\u2019s mattresses \u201ctechnology\u201d. \u201cSome people would say yes, some would say no. A lot of technology goes in to developing the product. But is a Nike shoe technology? Is Gore-Tex?\u201d</p> <p>James Cox, the founder and chief executive of Simba Sleep, says he \u201cdefinitely\u201d sees his company as a technology firm. \u201cThe mattress market was one of the last venues that hadn\u2019t seen any change. The simple direct-to-consumer offerings that the likes of Casper came up with were clever, but more from the marketing than the product side.\u201d</p> <p>As for Casper itself \u2013 no surprises: \u201cCasper is indeed a technology company,\u201d the company\u2019s co-founder Constantin Eis tells me. \u201cWe have an army of web developers that allowed us to build and scale software to enable one of the fastest growing brands of all time. Our tech hardware is our sleep product line. The engineering team at Casper is based in San Francisco, where they researched, designed, prototyped, and iterated on the mattress, pillow, and sheets.\u201d</p> <p>Not to be outdone, Cox says Simba\u2019s mattress is \u201cthe most advanced in the world\u201d, not only in terms of actually sleeping in it, but also in how it\u2019s built from the ground up to be sold online and posted to customers: even the springs are slightly conical, so that they can be compressed fully flat. \u201cWe\u2019re the only ones that have truly used technology to create a superior product,\u201d says Cox.</p> <p>Nonetheless \u2026 it\u2019s still foam and springs and fabric. Three types of foam, and conical springs, but still: does making really fancy foam and springs turn you into a technology company?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dd5994d5674aaf915bf9323fc732752ae15bcad2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dd5994d5674aaf915bf9323fc732752ae15bcad2/0_0_1200_720/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Simba\u2019s mattress test in progress.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Simba\u2019s mattress test in progress.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Simba</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Perhaps not. Perhaps the link isn\u2019t really in the product, or even the way the product is sold, but the way the company is run. \u201cWe\u2019re a tech-enabled business,\u201d says Cox: \u201cWe acquire clients in the most strategic way possible, and we acquire them for the least amount of money.\u201d That means things like heavily targeted Facebook adverts, smart lead generation for sales and canny investment in growth.</p> <p>Indeed, the attitude to growth is perhaps the single biggest thing that unites all three companies against the Warren Evanses of the world. All describe, in different forms, what\u2019s come to be known as \u201cgrowth hacking\u201d as core to their approach: rapid experimentation in marketing and development with the aim of quickly identifying and putting into practice methods to build their business. For Eve, that included offering a chunk of its company directly to Channel 4, leading to its first TV adverts; for Casper, branching out from mattresses to similarly fancy pillows and sheets; for Simba, a smart manufacturing line that lets it identify faults from returned mattresses and monitor across batches for similar problems.</p> <p>And behind that attitude to growth is another similarity: the money. All three companies are structured more like a high-growth tech startup than a staid physical goods retailer, and they have the investment to match. Simba shares investors with Made.com and Lastminute.com, Eve with Shazam and Happen, and Casper with Twitter and Snapchat.</p> <p>Until recently, if you wanted to make a $100m (\u00a377m) in a year, you probably wouldn\u2019t have started selling mattresses. But the internet changed that, opening up the possibility of a company like Casper going nationwide faster than ever before \u2013 and the money provided by the venture capital system, which matured in the forge of Silicon Valley, made that possible. That, then, is the real technology legacy flowing in to all three companies: the belief that with a big bang and big bucks, it\u2019s possible to jump into a whole new market and fully reshape it in your image.</p> <ul> <li><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jul/19/thread-fashion-stylist-startup-machine-learning-ai\">Would you trust a stylist with 50,000 clients to get your look right?</a></strong><br></li> </ul>",

  "<p>A lack of transparency on antibiotic use by the Australian farming industry is undermining efforts to prevent superbugs developing and spreading through the food supply, an infectious diseases physician and microbiologist has said.</p> <p>The comments from Prof Peter Collignon come as the UN general assembly holds a meeting involving all 193 member states to develop a plan to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/sep/20/un-declaration-antibiotic-drug-resistance\">fight the threat of antibiotic resistance</a>. It is only the fourth time the assembly has met on a public health issue.</p> <p>Collignon said that while antibiotic resistance in humans through overprescribing of the drugs was part of the problem, the use of antibiotics in the food industry was being \u201cwidely abused around the world\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/sep/20/un-declaration-antibiotic-drug-resistance\">UN agrees to fight 'the biggest threat to modern medicine': antibiotic resistance</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThere is a lack of appropriate controls in Australia for antibiotic use in food,\u201d said Collignon, who has sat on a number of World Health Organisation advisory committees on antibiotic resistance.</p> <p><em>\u201c</em>We know the US pork industry uses four to five times the amount of antibiotics as the industry in Denmark. In Australia we don\u2019t really know, we don\u2019t know which antibiotic is given for which animal and how much. </p> <p>\u201cIn humans you need prescriptions so we can get that data but in food and animals we don\u2019t know because there\u2019s not the mechanism to get the data, and manufacturers cite commercial confidence.\u201d</p> <p>In other countries, third-generation antibiotic-resistant E.coli in the chicken supply has been found. In Australia, those same antibiotics are being used in pigs and cattle, Collignon said, though it was unclear how much. </p> <p>\u201cAs far as we are aware it\u2019s not used in chickens in Australia but there isn\u2019t a law that says it can\u2019t be,\u201d he said. \u201cIf a vet were to start using it tomorrow in chickens, there would be no way for me to find that out.<br></p> <p>\u201cPerdue chickens in US produce twice as many chickens as the whole of Australia and yet they\u2019ve managed to go completely antibiotic-free. </p> <p>\u201cThey had to invest about $100m to do so but, by making the investment and improving animal husbandry, it was possible. So any argument from industry that they need antibiotics and it can\u2019t be stopped is facetious.\u201d</p> <p>With Australians travelling overseas and produce being imported from overseas, the UN general assembly meeting on the issue would be an important step towards encouraging other countries to clean up their water supply and curb their use of antibiotics, particularly in livestock feed as an illness preventative and as a growth stimulant, he said.</p> <p>Prof Lindsay Grayson, the director of the department of infectious diseases and microbiology at Austin Health, said hospitals and laboratories could also become more transparent about the incidence of superbugs.

The priority for any social worker should be to keep the safety and wellbeing of children at the forefront of all we do. </p> <p>However, I also believe that children should remain with their families as much as possible. While it might lead to immediate safety, being taken from a family brings trauma in the guise of grief and a complete loss of identity. I constantly felt the burden of these competing ideals. </p> <p>Sadly, I worked with women who had children repeatedly removed. This ranged from the second child to the eighth, and it was depressing to see how little we were able to do to change the situation.

The emphasis on assessments is difficult for parents. They are being tested at the most emotionally challenging time of their lives and they will also be experiencing grief and loss, not just the child. </p> <p>If the judge decides that the baby cannot return to the parents then the social worker is already focusing on alternative care arrangements, perhaps with adopters.

I know what they represent \u2013 the growing solidarity among Polish women (and many men) in the struggle for our reproductive rights, a struggle once left to feminist groups working at society\u2019s margins.</p> <p>No longer. On Wednesday our fight will come up against another draft law \u2013 the \u201cStop Abortion\u201d law \u2013 which has been put forward by the ruling <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/27/poland-law-justice-party-wins-235-seats-can-govern-alone\" title=\"\">Law and Justice party</a>. Supported by the Catholic church, it would ban abortion in all circumstances except to protect the life of the pregnant woman.</p> <p>Not a single MP has publicly supported our draft law in the Sejm. Over the summer, a diverse coalition of NGOs \u2013 which includes women\u2019s rights, human rights, and democracy-building organisations \u2013 collected more than <a href=\"http://sxpolitics.org/abortion-politics-in-poland-save-the-women-legal-initiative-tabled-in-polish-parliament/15390\" title=\"\">200,000 signatures for our petition</a> \u2013 twice the number required to ensure a debate in parliament.</p> <p>Our draft \u201cSave Women\u201d law would allow abortion on request in the first 12 weeks of a pregnancy, increase access to contraception and sex education, and preserve existing exceptions for foetal anomalies until the 24th week, and for rape or sexual abuse until the 18th week.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/18/thousands-protest-against-proposed-stricter-abortion-law-in-poland\">Thousands protest against proposed stricter abortion law in Poland</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Last weekend, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/18/thousands-protest-against-proposed-stricter-abortion-law-in-poland\" title=\"\">thousands gathered outside parliament</a> in Warsaw to protest at the \u201cStop Abortion\u201d law \u2013 a show of force that has taken everyone in our country by surprise. It is as if Polish women have woken up from a long dream. We had grown accustomed to our abortion law (the wealthy merely paid for the plane tickets and medical procedures needed to work around it) and everyone seemed to accept it as a measure to keep the peace in our predominantly Catholic country. But even Catholic women are appalled at the move by the Law and Justice party to restrict our already limited reproductive rights. \u201cNot one step further,\u201d goes the rallying cry.</p> <p>The current law is more conservative than it appears on paper because so many doctors opt out of providing abortions by claiming to be conscientious objectors \u2013 my organisation, the <a href=\"http://www.federa.org.pl/english\" title=\"\">Federation for Women and Family Planning</a>, learns of at least two or three such cases every day. Even more problematic is the fact that some doctors make this objection in their work at public hospitals while continuing to provide abortions at high prices in their private practice.</p> <p>Because the \u201cStop Abortion\u201d law further criminalises doctors who perform abortions, the sole remaining exception allowing it to be carried out to protect the life of the pregnant woman would be meaningless. Doctors have told us they would err on the side of caution if the alternative might mean spending five years in prison.</p> <p>In fact, the draconian nature of the law has done more to broaden support for women\u2019s rights in Poland than any effort by women\u2019s groups. Europe has taken notice too. Polish reproductive rights will be debated next month in the European parliament.</p> <p>The 1,500 signatures I have in my drawer may not sound like a lot. But consider the context. Before this law was proposed, my organisation had about 4,000 individual supporters. Today we have about 6,000. Visits to our website have increased by 25% in the past two months, and our Facebook followers have grown by more than 50%. More women visited our office in June and July than in the previous 25 years \u2013 tangible proof of the growing interest in women\u2019s reproductive rights.</p> <p>One woman I spoke to at first declined to sign our petition. \u201cOh no, I couldn\u2019t,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m against abortion.\u201d</p> <p>Then she proceeded to tell me that, as a second-year student, she would find a way to have an abortion if she got pregnant because having a child at this time in her life would derail her studies. When I pointed out the injustice inherent in being for her own abortion but against every other woman\u2019s, she signed the petition.</p> <p>When I talk to people about our efforts, I never say we are \u201cfor abortion\u201d. I say we are for the right to safe, legal abortion. In a country where 150,000 illegal abortions are performed every year, that shouldn\u2019t be a radical idea. Indeed, the \u201cSave Women\u201d petition shows that it isn\u2019t.</p>",

The person put in charge of setting up the new body \u2013 much to the sector\u2019s surprise \u2013 was the veteran TV executive and former chairman of both the BBC and ITV, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/may/22/michael-grade-bbc-luvvies-recipes\">Michael Grade</a>.</p> <p>Interviewed in his private Mayfair offices ahead of his speech on 22 September at the Media Trust\u2019s annual reception, Lord Grade \u2013 he was made a Conservative peer in 2011 \u2013 said he did not need much persuading to take on the role.As a self-confessed \u201cnews junkie\u201d he\u2019d followed last year\u2019s charity scandals with interest and with some sympathy for the charities caught up in them. \u201cI thought to myself, as a trustee for over 30-40 years with dozens of charities, I don\u2019t think I ever worried about how we got the money \u2026 and I think that\u2019s been typical of most trustees who go into these things with wonderful commitment. The whole question of the ethics of fundraising has never really been an issue.\u201d</p> <p>Soon after Etherington\u2019s report was published, Grade was sounded out by Whitehall to chair the Fundraising Regulator. \u201cThey needed to get things done fast, they needed someone with a bit of profile and a bit of experience who could get the thing on the road as soon as possible, and my name came out of the hat. I knew immediately I wanted to do it.\u201d</p> <p>Nine months later, Grade reports that the new regulator is up and running, with a full team and funding in place, and taking calls from the public. Since it opened in July, it has received 174 complaints: 19 are being investigated, including the latest scandal involving alleged abuses by employees of the Neet Feet fundraising company, <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/1422874/charity-firm-hires-drugged-up-ex-criminals-to-squash-old-and-vulnerable-for-donations/\">revealed by the Sun newspaper</a> in July. Its first adjudications are expected in a few weeks\u2019 time. It is a \u201cpromising start\u201d, he says.</p> <p>In the wake of the Cooke and Rae scandals there was much talk of \u201ctough regulation\u201d, but Grade appears more conciliatory. \u201cThe key for us is to draw the line between making sure that charities are not inhibited in their ability to raise money for the causes they care about, and we all care about, while \u2026 making sure that there isn\u2019t an erosion of public confidence. It only takes one horrible case and the whole sector is tarred with it, whether they like it or not.\u201d</p> <p>Charities and trustees need to raise their game, not because the Fundraising Regulator will deal out harsh punishments, but because they will suffer if they don\u2019t \u2013 in terms of diminished public trust and the implied threat of heavier statutory regulation. \u201cI\u2019m against statutory regulation and I hope it will never be necessary, but that is in the hands of the charities. If they behave, by and large, then we can maintain a voluntary, independent regime.\u201d</p> <p>He promises a fair and speedy complaints process that will, with the support of the charities concerned, resolve cases in weeks rather than months. His biggest fear is that charities will treat hearings as judicial battlegrounds. \u201cMy plea to charities is: \u2018Can we please keep lawyers out of it.\u2019 We hope our processes are going to be fair and open and balanced. It is not in our interest to have a kangaroo court. The last thing we need is for m\u2019learned friends to get involved and suck hundreds of thousands of pounds out of the sector.\u201d</p> <p>The trickiest part of the regulator\u2019s remit is likely to be the fundraising preference service, an arrangement that will allow donors to register to opt out of receiving any unsolicited fundraising communications from charities. It is expected to come into force later this year. Charities are worried that this could choke off a crucial source of income for them at a time when their finances are ever more precarious.</p> <p>Grade argues that this is unlikely. The important thing is that people regain a measure of control over their private space, he says. \u201cI deeply resent being cold-called. [Charity salespeople] knock on my door at 8 o\u2019clock at night \u2026 [I say to them] \u2018Go away!\u2019 However good the cause, it\u2019s not what you want. You want to have control over your life and therefore if we can show people they can get control, that is a good thing for the health of the charitable sector long term.\u201d</p> <p>Grade says he agreed to stay for a year and will leave the regulator in June 2017. How will he know if he has succeeded? He wants complaints levels to rise, and then over time reduce, as charities\u2019 fundraising practice improves. \u201cMy vision of success [for the regulator] is that there is no business coming in. That\u2019s success, really, isn\u2019t it? That we have people sitting around with nothing to do. That would be a wonderful success.\u201d</p> <p>He breaks into smile. \u201cIt\u2019s never going to happen \u2026\u201d</p> <h2>Curriculum vitae</h2> <p><strong>Age</strong> 73.<br></p> <p><strong>Family</strong> Married with three children (two from a previous marriage).</p> <p><strong>Education</strong> St Dunstan\u2019s College, London.</p> <p><strong>Career</strong> 2016-present: chairman, Charities Fundraising Regulator; 2014-present: co-owner, the Grade Linnit Company; 2014-present, director, Land Rover BAR; 2011-2015: director, WRG Group; 2011\u201314: lay member, Press Complaints Commission; 2010\u201312: non-executive chair, James Grant Group; 2009: member, Panel on Fair Access to the Professions; 2007\u201309: executive chairman and chief executive, ITV; 2004\u201306: member, board of governors, BBC; 2000-present, chairman, Pinewood Group; 2000\u201304: chairman, Index on Censorship; 1991\u20132000: director, then chairman, then chief executive, First Leisure Corporation; 1994\u201396: member, the National Commission of Inquiry into Prevention of Child Abuse; 1988\u201397: chief executive, Channel 4; 1986\u201387: director of programmes, BBC TV; 1984\u201386: controller, BBC1; 1981\u201384: president, Embassy Television; 1973-81: deputy controller programmes, then director of programmes, London Weekend Television; 1969-73: joint managing director, London Management and Representation; 1966-69: theatrical agent; 1960-66: trainee journalist, then sports columnist, Daily Mirror.</p> <p><strong>Interests</strong> Entertainment, sailing.</p>",

  "<p>US drug regulator the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued warnings about possible side effects of taking varenicline. Varenicline (marketed as Chantix in the US, and Champix in the UK) is a drug which <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23728690\">can help people</a> stop smoking. The FDA\u2019s warnings are out of date, do not reflect the scientific evidence, and urgently need to be updated. They may have led the public and clinicians to incorrectly believe that there was strong scientific evidence that varenicline causes or exacerbates mental health problems. Given varenicline is the most effective way to successfully stop smoking, these safety concerns may have resulted in fewer people successfully stopping smoking.</p> <h2><strong>A brief history FDA\u2019s warnings over varenicline</strong></h2> <p>In May 2006 the <a href=\"http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/2006/ucm108651.htm\">FDA approved</a> varenicline for use as a medication to help people stop smoking. This was the first treatment licensed for smoking cessation since 1997, and initial evidence suggested that people who took it were more likely to successfully stop smoking. However, it was not long before concerns were raised that people prescribed varenicline were experiencing mental health side effects. Newspapers reported a series of anecdotes that people taking varenicline had suicidal behaviour. The FDA\u2019s Adverse Event Reporting System (AERS) <a href=\"http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/PostmarketDrugSafetyInformationforPatientsandProviders/DrugSafetyInformationforHeathcareProfessionals/ucm169986.htm\">suggested</a> patients prescribed varenicline were more likely to report suicidal behaviour than patients prescribed other medications. The key question was, are these differences a result of taking varenicline, or is it just that patients prescribed it had a higher risk of these events even before they were prescribed treatment? Were they due to correlation or causation?</p> <p>The FDA attempted to answer this question in a <a href=\"http://www.fda.gov/downloads/AdvisoryCommittees/CommitteesMeetingMaterials/Drugs/PsychopharmacologicDrugsAdvisoryCommittee/UCM418705.pdf\">safety review</a> that was published in February 2008. They <a href=\"http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/PostmarketDrugSafetyInformationforPatientsandProviders/ucm051136.htm\">concluded</a> that \u201c[varenicline] may cause worsening of a current psychiatric illness even if it is currently under control and may cause an old psychiatric illness to reoccur.\u201d In July 2009, after pressure from the media and consumer groups, the FDA went further, <a href=\"http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/PostmarketDrugSafetyInformationforPatientsandProviders/DrugSafetyInformationforHeathcareProfessionals/ucm169986.htm\">mandating</a> that varenicline carry a \u201cBlack Box warning\u201d. Black Box warnings are the FDA\u2019s strongest warning about possible side effects of drugs. The Black Box warning for varenicline highlights \u201cthe risk of serious neuropsychiatric symptoms in patients using these products\u201d. Symptoms included changes in behaviour, hostility, agitation, depressed mood, suicidal thoughts and behaviour, and attempted suicide.</p> <p>The FDA then commissioned two large observational cohort studies to examine the risks associated with varenicline. They also instructed Pfizer to conduct a large randomised trial to investigate the side effects of varenicline in people with mental health problems. </p> <p>Results from the observational studies were reported in October 2011. In both studies people prescribed varenicline had similar risks of being hospitalised for psychiatric problems as patients prescribed nicotine replacement therapy \u2013 in other words, there was no evidence of increased risk. However, these were observational studies, rather than experimental (randomised trials), so could not <em>prove</em> that varenicline did not cause adverse outcomes. However, most epidemiologists would regard these studies as more reliable evidence than the anecdotal case reports and newspaper reports which originally raised concerns about these risks. Nevertheless, in response to this new evidence, the FDA \u201cdetermined that the current warnings in the varenicline drug label, based on post marketing surveillance reports, remain appropriate\u201d and did not remove the Black Box warning.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/sifting-the-evidence/2014/jul/15/smoking-and-mental-health-whats-the-connection\">Smoking and mental health, what's the connection? | Suzi Gage</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Meanwhile, further observational studies were amassing evidence about whether varenicline use is associated with adverse events. In 2009, our colleagues <a href=\"http://www.bmj.com/content/339/bmj.b3805\">found</a> no evidence that patients in UK prescribed varenicline had higher risks of suicidal behaviour. In 2013, we <a href=\"http://www.bmj.com/content/347/bmj.f5704\">updated</a> this evidence to include over 100,000 patients, and again found that patients prescribed varenicline had similar risks of suicidal behaviour and similar rates of self-harm. In 2015, we <a href=\"http://www.bmj.com/content/350/bmj.h1109\">systematically reviewed</a> the literature of randomised controlled trials, and again found that participants given varenicline had similar risks of suicide and self-harm as those given placebo. </p> <p>In March 2015 the FDA issued a further update. Despite mounting evidence about the safety of varenicline, they did not change their warnings. In 2016, the randomised controlled trial the FDA commissioned reported its findings. <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673616302720\">This trial</a> randomised 8,144 people to receive varenicline, nicotine patch, bupropion or placebo, and found that people allocated to varenicline rather than nicotine replacement products experienced <em>fewer</em> moderate and severe mental health adverse events. The European Medicine Agency, which regulates pharmaceuticals in Europe, recently <a href=\"http://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/EPAR_-_Procedural_steps_taken_and_scientific_information_after_authorisation/human/000699/WC500025256.pdf\">updated</a> the information it provides about varenicline. In contrast, to date the FDA has refused to update its warnings.</p> <h2><strong>Correlation does not equal causation</strong></h2> <p>Patients who take medications are different from the general population. This means that even if patients prescribed a drug are more likely to have a particular adverse event this does not necessarily prove that these events are caused by the drug. In the case of varenicline, people who smoke <a href=\"http://www.surgeongeneral.gov/library/reports/50-years-of-progress/full-report.pdf\">are different</a> from the general population on average; they are usually poorer, sicker, and more likely to have mental health problems. So the fact that patients taking varenicline reported higher rates of suicidal behaviour than patients prescribed other drugs in the FDA Adverse Events Reporting System, may have been because these patients were at higher risk of these events, <em>before</em> taking varenicline. This means these adverse events are unreliable evidence of the difference when taking varenicline or other nicotine replacement products.</p> <h2><strong>Spurious safety warnings can be extremely harmful</strong></h2> <p>In 1998 a paper was published which suggested that there might be an association between taking the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine and developing autism. These claims were <a href=\"http://www.bmj.com/content/342/bmj.c7452.full\">false</a>, and multiple, large, well-conducted studies have proven that these claims were <a href=\"http://www.bmj.com/content/342/bmj.c7452.full\">false</a>, and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/apr/21/no-link-between-mmr-and-autism-major-study-concludes\">MMR vaccine is not associated with, and does not cause autism</a>. Nevertheless, these warnings led to a substantial fall in vaccination rates, and an increase in cases of measles. So it is vital for regulators to distinguish between side effects which are caused by drugs, and potential events which the drugs do not cause. These could be events that are correlated with a medication, or risks for which the regulator does not have any reliable evidence. </p> <p>In 2007 <a href=\"http://www.fda.gov/downloads/AdvisoryCommittees/CommitteesMeetingMaterials/Drugs/PsychopharmacologicDrugsAdvisoryCommittee/UCM520103.pdf\">3.9 million patients</a> took varenicline in the US. In 2012, after the safety warnings were issued, only 1.2 million patients took varenicline. Thus a potential cost of issuing safety warnings is that fewer patients take otherwise effective medications.</p> <h2><strong>What should we do now?</strong></h2> <p>From the first warnings about potential adverse effects of varenicline on mental health in November 2007 to today, 4.1 million people are likely to have died from smoking related disease in <a href=\"http://www.surgeongeneral.gov/library/reports/50-years-of-progress/full-report.pdf\">the US alone</a>. The FDA\u2019s Black Box warning of mental health problems associated with varenicline is inconsistent with the latest scientific evidence. Ultimately, it could discourage people from using the most effective smoking cessation treatment. In 14<sup>th</sup> of September 2016, the FDA\u2019s expert advisory group for drug safety met and again reviewed the evidence about the side effects associated with varenicline. The vote was close: they voted 10 to 9 in favour of advising the FDA to remove its warning. However, given the committee\u2019s lack of consensus, it is not clear if the FDA will follow their guidance. In our opinion, given the evidence, the FDA needs to urgently revise this safety warning.</p> <p><em>Dr Kyla Thomas is a National Institute for Health Research funded Clinical Lecturer in Public Health Medicine based at the University of Bristol and an Honorary Consultant in Public Health.

Although they would be resuming their 2,278-mile journey to Los Angeles the next day \u2013 joining the<a href=\"https://www.amtrak.com/sunset-limited-train\"> Sunset Limited</a> to the west coast \u2013 they had an overnight stop, and only one hotel in mind for it.</p> <p>\u201cIn San Antonio,\u201d Bragg explains, \u201cthere\u2019s the Gunter Hotel. That\u2019s where Robert Johnson had his first recording session, in room 414.\u201d<br></p> <p>\u201cAnd he only had two sessions,\u201d Henry chips in.<br></p> <p>\u201cHe recorded <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dkftesK2dck\">Sweet Home Chicago</a> in that hotel,\u201d Bragg continues. \u201cSo I thought we should at least go there and get a bit of a vibe from that. The train was really late, and we turned up about half past two in the morning, totally knackered. And damned if I didn\u2019t get room 414. I checked under the bed and in the cupboard to see if <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/jun/16/robert-johnson-sells-soul-devil\">the devil was there waiting to offer me great guitar-playing skills in return for my soul</a>\u201d \u2013 it turns out he wasn\u2019t \u2013 \u201cand the next morning, over coffee, I said to Joe, \u2018You know we\u2019ve got to record something here.\u2019 So we set up in the room.\u201d<br></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mJnOX6fbvo\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/-mJnOX6fbvo?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mJnOX6fbvo\">Watch Bragg and Henry\u2019s video for Gentle on My Mind on YouTube</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>The song they chose was Waiting for a Train by Jimmie Rodgers, one of 13 they recorded during their 65-hour journey across the US \u2013 two men, their voices and their guitars, on trains, on platforms, in waiting rooms \u2013 for Shine a Light: Field Recordings from the Great American Railroad. It\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/aug/21/billy-bragg-joe-henry-st-pancras-shine-a-light-review\">an album of folk and blues standards</a>, reflecting on the invention that opened up the vast country. Deep in the background you can hear the life of the railroad: the sounds of passengers, station bustle, slamming doors, luggage being loaded, engines pulling out are embedded in the record.<br></p> <p>So, what is the Gunter like now? An eerie piece of heritage, cobwebbed and dusty?<br></p> <p>\u201c<a href=\"http://www.sheratongunter.com/\">It\u2019s a Sheraton</a>,\u201d Henry says. \u201cBut there\u2019s no missing the fact it was a grand old hotel. And they completely recognise the significance of what happened there. The bar is called the <a href=\"http://www.bar414.com/history-of-bar-414/\">Bar 414</a>, and all they play is Robert Johnson.\u201d Which, given he only recorded 29 songs, must get wearing for the staff, but still. A bit like the old <a href=\"http://www.spectator.co.uk/2015/08/a-n-wilsons-diary-vj-day-and-the-virginia-woolf-burger-bar/\">Virginia Woolf Burger Bar</a> at the Russell Hotel in Bloomsbury, then?<br></p> <p>\u201cOh, she loved a burger, she did,\u201d Bragg says, deadpan.<br></p> <p>\u201cThe bar was long closed when we arrived, so I didn\u2019t get a chance to see how garish it might be,\u201d Henry says.<br></p> <p>\u201cOr what the names of their cocktails were.\u201d<br></p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll have a Hellhound on My Trail, please.\u201d<br></p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>When you conjure an automobile in a song, it's just an automobile \u2013 a train speaks to something other</p> <footer> <cite></cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cAnd I\u2019ll have a Terraplane.\u201d<br></p> <p>Henry pulls back to seriousness. \u201cBut the Sheraton doesn\u2019t have the authority to defeat the power of his mythology.\u201d And, it should be said, <a href=\"http://www.bar414.com/bar414menu/\">Bar 414 doesn\u2019t go in for tawdry, Johnson-themed drinks</a>.<br></p> <p>Mythology is at the heart of Shine a Light, in songs such as John Henry \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.metrolyrics.com/john-henry-lyrics-woody-guthrie.html\">the story of the African-American steel driver</a> who beats a steam-powered hammer in a race but dies at its end \u2013 and Railroad Bill, the outlaw who achieved Robin Hood status. It\u2019s also there in the concept of the American railroad itself. \u201cAnybody who writes a song \u2013 and even Mr Springsteen would attest to this, I\u2019m sure \u2013 knows that when you conjure an automobile in a song, it\u2019s just an automobile,\u201d Henry says. \u201cBut when you conjure a train, it speaks to something other. It lays out a whole deck of cards of possibility in front of you, dreams of loss and longing.\u201d<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"26009c510e184e54b1a806cbdf0e2da385daef53\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/26009c510e184e54b1a806cbdf0e2da385daef53/60_0_776_970/400.jpg\" alt=\"Billy Bragg and Joe Henry\" width=\"400\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018There trains and then there\u2019s the railroad\u2019 \u2026 Billy Bragg and Joe Henry</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThere\u2019s trains, and there\u2019s the railroad,\u201d Bragg suggests. \u201cAnd \u2018the railroad\u2019 is one of those phrases like \u2018the west\u2019 that has an immediate and evocative sense of space and light, and distance and hope, and fear. The railroad was such a transformative technology, right up to the end of the second world war when the Americans built the interstates. People relied on the railroad not just for travel, but for bringing news, bringing goods. The connectivity of the internet is nothing compared to the physical change that was brought by the railroad.\u201d<br></p> <p>They talk of how the railroad unified the US, bridging its two coasts, and opening up the possibility of building cities in places other than on the coasts and the banks of the great rivers. They talk of the thousands who built the railways, and the thousands who must have died doing so, and how <a href=\"http://railroad.lindahall.org/siteart/home-map/6_PromontorySummit.jpg\">the famous photo of the uniting of the railroads at Promontory Summit</a>, in Utah, portrays only white faces, when the railways were built by black and Chinese workers \u2013 a whitewashing of history. They talk of the tiny towns they passed through on their journey, places whose entire existence is owed to the presence of the railroad. Alpine, Texas, for example \u2013 now advertised by Amtrak as your stopping-off point to visit Big Bend National Park. \u201cIt\u2019s only there because it had a source of fresh water for the railroad,\u201d Bragg notes.<br></p> <p>What\u2019s fascinating for a British listener is how many of these songs and stories are familiar. Some of them I heard growing up, from my mother, who was anything but deeply immersed in the African-American folk tradition. That\u2019s because she would have heard them on the radio in her teens, sung by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2004/jun/21/popandrock\">Lonnie Donegan</a>, the great populariser of American folk music in the UK.<br></p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There are some times I really have to be 'Billy Bragg' \u2026\u00a0But I can\u2019t go out every night and be a firebrand</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cEveryone refers to the fact that Ramblin\u2019 Jack Elliott came here in \u201955, \u201956, \u201957,\u201d Bragg says. \u201cHe was impressing the hell out of people in the folk clubs \u2013 but Lonnie Donegan was getting into the Top 10. You don\u2019t think of Donegan as a white blues singer, but that\u2019s what he was doing. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7col8uqIQQ\">He sings the shit out of Rock Island Line</a> \u2013 he gets faster and faster and faster, and he loses control of the song. In America, people who were using the same material were so aware they were dealing with a racial divide that they felt they couldn\u2019t put into the those songs the same feeling that black Americans did, because they\u2019d be accused of doing blackface and appropriating. But Donegan \u2013 he goes at it with so much energy that when he did go to America he was accused of being a Jim Crow by a black American journalist. But he was sincere in his love of the material, and being removed from the source meant he could go at it like gunpowder. He\u2019s the first guy to get in the charts playing a guitar, and he\u2019s playing <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCiJ4QQG9WQ\">a Lead Belly song</a>. A lot of the things we take for granted about 60s music spark out of that moment.\u201d<br></p> <p>Shine a Light is very much an album, not just 13 songs \u2013 something that is particularly important to Henry. \u201cThe album is a recognisable form, like the sonnet or the haiku or the three-act play. To make an album that has a concept framing it is a way to remind people that this is a deliberate creation, not just songs in a pile. I\u2019m a record producer for a lot of other artists, and this is something I think about a lot. Sequence really matters, content really matters. If you put more than 13 songs on a record you lose the thread \u2013 it starts to feel like a compilation.\u201d<br></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQG3eWj6N-4\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/kQG3eWj6N-4?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQG3eWj6N-4\">Watch the video for The L&amp;N Don\u2019t Stop Here Any More</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Both men reminisce about albums they still can\u2019t put on without playing the whole thing \u2013 Highway 61 Revisited, Astral Weeks, Dusty in Memphis, <a href=\"http://www.allmusic.com/album/good-old-boys-mw0000196672\">Randy Newman\u2019s Good Old Boys</a> \u2013 and then start eulogising the simple power of the song. \u201cI\u2019m nearly 60,\u201d Bragg says, \u201cbut every so often, a song really gets me and won\u2019t let me go. There\u2019s one by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jul/21/izzy-bizu-its-ok-to-be-a-space-chicken\">Izzy Bizu</a> that I saw on Later \u2026 and she hadn\u2019t released it, and I needed it so much that I played the video clip and put my iPhone up by the speaker.

Then again, he says: \u201cThere are some times that I really have to be Billy Bragg. Glastonbury, the night Brexit went down, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMGrXCLToIE\">I was headlining the Left Field stage</a>. I had a real role to play there as someone playing to a load of predominantly young people who\u2019d woken up feeling like they didn\u2019t belong in their own country \u2013 to let them know they weren\u2019t alone. But I can\u2019t do that every night. I can\u2019t go out every night and be a firebrand.\u201d<br></p> <p>During those three days on the railroads, at least he could be sure no one needed him to be Billy Bragg, to lead the calls for something, anything. (He thanks me for not spending 90 minutes asking about Jeremy Corbyn; there\u2019s just a brief expression of support and a plea for intra-party tolerance at the end.) In the US, the pair were almost completely ignored, whatever they sang, wherever they sang it. \u201cI felt like we were beautifully and anomalously invisible,\u201d says Henry. \u201cIt was strangely heartening to think that singing with a couple of guitars in a train station could just be part of the fabric of the day.\u201d<br></p> <ul> <li><a href=\"http://shinealight-joehenry.billybragg.co.uk/\">Shine a Light: Field Recordings from the Great American Railroad</a> is released on 23 September on Cooking Vinyl.

  "<p>If there\u2019s one thing Donald Trump\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign has taught us it\u2019s to view every depraved moral nadir as a challenge, not a destination. You think this is bad? Wait for the tangy mouth garbage he\u2019s got stewing for tomorrow. Then forget about it instantly \u2013 everyone else will! I heard state department employees sometimes email each other!!!</p> <p>Just this week we\u2019ve seen Trump metabolise the Chelsea bombing into an incoherent anti-Clinton smear before the shrapnel had even settled. I\u2019ve listened to my Muslim friends express their fear of leaving the house after <a href=\"http://nymag.com/selectall/2016/09/new-yorkers-just-received-a-terrible-emergency-alert.html\">Monday\u2019s unconscionably irresponsible emergency alert</a>, the kind of histrionic racial profiling Trump vows to amplify. We\u2019ve read up on <a href=\"http://nymag.com/thecut/2016/09/donald-trumps-new-anti-abortion-letter-should-terrify-you.html\">Trump\u2019s alignment with an anti-abortion extremist group</a>, and his avowal to <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2016/09/19/donald-trumps-law-and-order-approach-wont-make-us-safer/\">\u201cget very tough\u201d</a> on \u201cthing[s]\u201d apparently including <a href=\"http://fusion.net/story/348568/donald-trump-free-speech-ny-bomb/\">freedom of expression</a>. We\u2019ve clocked Trump\u2019s pin-drop silence on the shooting deaths of Terence Crutcher and Tyre King, though \u2013 don\u2019t worry \u2013 over the summer he promised to make the streets safer \u2026 for police. Trump \u201cjoked\u201d (again!) <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2016/9/16/12949204/trump-jokes-clinton-assassination\">about the assassination of Hillary Clinton</a>. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/20/donald-trump-jnr-compares-refugees-poisoned-skittles-twitter-reacted\">His son compared refugees, who are human beings who need our asylum to live, to Skittles</a>, which are sweets.</p> <p>It was a panoply of potentially career-ending gaffes extruded, clumped, scooped and forgotten in a single week \u2013 AKA business as usual in proto-Trump America. Baffled disgust turned to abject terror (in my circles, at least) when new poll numbers saw Trump climb to 42%.</p> <p>So, yesterday (like most days in these, surely, the end times), I wrote some snotty doom and gloom about Trump on Facebook and, to my surprise, was gently scolded by a friend. \u201cHating Trump isn\u2019t enough,\u201d she said, \u201cjust like hating W wasn\u2019t enough in 2004. We have to talk about Hillary.\u201d I was defensive for a second \u2013 I do talk about Hillary! \u2013 but couldn\u2019t quibble with her point. It\u2019s easy and fun (and compulsory for responsible human beings) to despise Trump, but treating Clinton like a barely-better-than-a-literal-white-supremacist cipher does her \u2013 and our future as a non-blown-up planet \u2013 no favours. Yes, Trump is an objectively, dangerously horrendous candidate. But we have to start acknowledging that even if we scrubbed Trump from this universe altogether (buy my fan fiction!), Clinton would still be an excellent one.</p> <p>I cannot wait to vote for Hillary Clinton, but not just because I want to see Donald Trump fail and cry.</p> <p>Clinton is pro-choice. This means she does not want to force anyone to give birth to their rapist\u2019s child, or carry a dead foetus inside of their body for 20 weeks, or derail their future because sex is great and everyone has it and accidents happen, or otherwise be a nonconsensual incubator of any kind. Clinton wants to make it harder, not easier, to buy guns. She believes in eliminating loopholes and expanding background checks on gun sales. She does not think domestic abusers should own guns, which is good, because abused women are five times more likely to be murdered if their abusive partner owns a gun. She would prefer your children not to get shot in schools or shopping malls or nightclubs. I agree.</p> <p>Clinton believes in guaranteed paid family leave, because fathers are parents too, and mothers shouldn\u2019t have to choose between career stagnation and going back to work while their episiotomy stitches are still oozing.</p> <p>Clinton wants to tax rich people more than poor people, which is a sentence that no one should have to type ever again.</p> <p>Clinton\u2019s platform addresses mass incarceration, the school-to-prison pipeline, climate change, violence against trans women of colour, the systemic neglect of veterans, mental health stigma, voting rights, student loan debt, public education and affordable health care. Clinton is the candidate whose views best represent my own.</p> <p>Whether or not you feel comfortable with every decision and position in Clinton\u2019s past (I do not), she is qualified for this job. She is a shrewd, savvy, tough politician.</p> <p>Clinton has weathered intrusive, insulting, gendered smear campaigns \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2016/08/18/490478924/cooked-up-after-a-hillary-clinton-gaffe-the-first-spouse-cookie-battle-is-back\">cookies</a>, Benghazi, emails and pneumonia \u2013 with a grace rivalled only by Obama\u2019s unflappable handling of birthers. She swam through tar every single day of her career and still surpassed male opponents who swam through water. She has been scrutinised in bad faith and beyond all reason for her entire campaign (and decades prior), and Republicans have still had to manufacture baroque, toothless scandals out of dust motes. Yet, somehow, 42% of my country apparently believes that Donald Trump is more qualified to address foreign policy and \u201csafety\u201d than an actual seasoned diplomat. Do you guys think \u201csecretary of state\u201d is the kind of secretary who gets the president coffee? Is that the confusion?</p> <p>We cannot excise sexism from this election (and here I am talking predominantly to white dudes \u2013 the group most disproportionately supporting Trump \u2013 who just have a vague \u201cfeeling\u201d that they don\u2019t like Clinton). You might not overtly hate women. You might be a fantastic boyfriend, husband, brother or son. You might not beat women or harass them or even objectify them or belittle them. But do you trust them? Do you hire them? Do you hire them for management positions? You\u2019re building a house. Do you prefer a male contractor or a female contractor? You\u2019re having open heart surgery tomorrow. Do you want a male surgeon or a female surgeon? If your gut says \u201cman\u201d, you have some introspection to do.</p> <p>So let\u2019s try again: you\u2019re voting for a president soon. Do you want a graduate of Yale law school who served eight years as a US senator and four as secretary of state? Or a racist landlord who moonlights as a tie salesman?</p> <p>I cannot wait to vote for Hillary Clinton.</p>",

Between 20 June and 10 August, Rahami allegedly purchased materials for the pipe and pressure cooker bombs under his own name through eBay, including citric acid, circuit boards, ball bearings and electric igniters, ingredients found in the 27th Street device. </p> <p>Responding to the allegations that Rahami bought materials for the bombs on eBay, the company said: \u201cWe\u2019ve been proactively working with law enforcement authorities on their investigation. The types of items bought by the suspect are legal to buy and sell in the United States and are widely available at online and offline stores.\u201d</p> <p>Also, an unidentified telephone service provider cooperating with the FBI indicated that it shipped two cellphones, used as detonators, to a store in Perth Amboy, New Jersey, near a residence Rahami claimed. Both phones were used in the Seaside Park and Chelsea bombs. </p> <p>Another phone used in the Chelsea bombs, the complaint alleges, \u201cwas subscribed in the name of a family member\u201d of Rahami\u2019s, although no one else has been charged as an accomplice. An unspecified family member\u2019s phone, now in the possession of the FBI, contains videos showing Rahami in a backyard in Elizabeth showing Rahami \u201cigniting incendiary material\u201d two days before the bombings. </p> <p>The bombs themselves, while powerful, failed to kill anyone and appeared to investigators to demonstrate minimal technical sophistication, leading some to believe their designs emerged from al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula\u2019s English-language web magazine Inspire. Although the Manhattan bombs reportedly used high-powered explosive \u2013 with one placed in a dumpster, a curious choice for a lethal device \u2013 they were \u201csomething any 12-year-old could do if he had access to Christmas lights, a phone and ball bearings,\u201d a US official told the Guardian. </p> <p>Legally, a charge of use of weapons of mass destruction does not necessarily have to involve chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear weapons.</p> <p>If the bombs were crude, the hunt for Rahami, an Elizabeth, New Jersey, resident who worked at his family\u2019s fried-chicken spot, and the circumstances of his capture have proven extraordinary. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1550d24424b09186daa214695cbc6f5062671ccd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1550d24424b09186daa214695cbc6f5062671ccd/0_175_750_450/500.jpg\" alt=\"The alert sent to mobile phones about the bombing suspect.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The alert sent to mobile phones about the bombing suspect.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Screengrab</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On Monday morning, the New York police department used an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/19/new-york-explosion-suspect-mobile-alert-ahmad-khan-rahami\">emergency-notification system</a>, typically employed for information on disasters or severe weather, to broadcast onto mobile phones an alert for Rahami. <br></p> <p>Hours later, as Rahami lay sleeping in the vestibule of a bar on East Elizabeth Avenue in Linden, New Jersey, the bar owner contacted local police, who recognized Rahami.

  "<p><strong>I booked a return flight with easyJet from Gatwick to Ibiza in May. The confirmation email contained a hyperlink to add the details of the flight to the calendar function on my iPhone. It said the flight was due to leave at 6.35am; we turned up at the airport at 5am, only to find that the flight details had been incorrectly imported. The flight was in fact departing at 5.35am and the gate was closed.</strong></p> <p><strong>EasyJet had not heard of a problem like this before and was unable to help. We managed to find a flight with another carrier later in the day, but at considerable cost. </strong></p> <p><strong>I contacted Apple and spoke to its most senior level of technical support, who confirmed that the problem lay within the hyperlink sent by easyJet. When I wrote to easyJet it said that its technical department would investigate \u2013 but I haven\u2019t heard anything. I then read an article describing how the Apple Calendar app \u201chandles time zones terribly\u201d. </strong><em>RT, Oxford</em></p> <p>Apple ignores three requests to comment on your case. Its support page explains that its Calendar app uses the default time zone in the settings of your Apple devices, and you have to turn on time zone support to create events in other time zones.</p> <p>However, you have had your settings checked and the times you were given make no sense. Your app declared your flight to Ibiza was calculated using GMT+1, which was correct for British summer time, yet the departure time was an hour out.</p> <p>Since then, you\u2019ve received a calendar invitation for a local yoga class in Oxford that imported at GMT-5. Apple at this point acknowledged a software error but, you say, has failed to get back to you.</p> <p>It sounds as though easyJet, despite its silence, has realised there is a problem with Calendar. \u201cWe previously offered calendar invites to passengers for flights they had booked,\u201d says a spokesperson. \u201cWe became aware after launching the feature that the flight time was influenced by local calendar settings and the time zone the passenger was in when adding this to their calendar. As soon as this became apparent easyJet removed the \u2018add to calendar\u2019 function. This occurrence is extremely rare and easyJet apologises that RT missed their flight as a result.\u201d</p> <p>It says that while the correct flight time would have been displayed on boarding passes, online check-in screens and email confirmations, its customer service team will get in touch to \u201cresolve the situation\u201d. This \u201cresolution\u201d turns out to be a refund of \u00a326 \u2013 the tax on the flight you missed.</p> <p>It would seem that there has been a technical error, but neither company is admitting it. You, meanwhile, are left to cover the cost \u2013 \u00a3971 for the two alternative tickets to Ibiza plus \u00a350 for a taxi to Heathrow.

  "<p>The humanitarian and international relief field is tough to break into, with thousands of smart, ambitious and eager graduates trying to enter the profession. Despite the competition, landing that dream job with an NGO or aid organisation can be achieved. Besides resilience, a thick skin and steely determination, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/careers/2016/sep/11/how-to-get-a-job-in-humanitarian-aid-and-relief-live-chat\">experts share</a> what you need to do to stand out from the crowd and win over future employers. </p> <h2>Scout out relevant work experience </h2> <p>Like many fiercely competitive sectors, it\u2019s best to build up work experience and seek out relevant voluntary work. \u201cLook for voluntary opportunities on websites such as Do-It and Volunteering Matters,\u201d suggests Rachel Locke, an adviser for the <a href=\"https://nationalcareersservice.direct.gov.uk/Pages/Home.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">National Careers Service</a>. </p> <p>Those looking to build their overseas experience should take a look at volunteering programs that could help you transfer your skills or kickstart a career in the humanitarian sector. \u201cFor those under 25, VSO\u2019s International Citizen Service [volunteering overseas on a project] is a good option,\u201d says Katherine Tubb, founder of volunteer agency <a href=\"http://2waydevelopment.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">2Way Development</a>. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/careers/2016/sep/11/how-to-get-a-job-in-humanitarian-aid-and-relief-live-chat\">How to get a job in humanitarian aid and relief \u2013 live chat</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cBut don\u2019t rule out the value of volunteering at home for organisations like the Red Cross, and the value of [doing] training courses with [disaster relief charities], such as RedR, to prepare you for volunteering or humanitarian work and to build your CV,\u201d says Tubb. \u201cAnd with new technology you can sit at home and volunteer remotely through portals such as the United Nations Volunteers, and arrange your volunteering activities around studies or work commitments.\u201d</p> <h2>Build up experience while studying</h2> <p>For those currently studying relevant international aid degrees and master\u2019s, there\u2019s a wealth of ways to start working towards your career goal. Nick Macdonald, a relief and development professional with over 15 years of experience working in conflict and disasters, advises using this time to engage with people and organisations working in that field. \u201cVolunteer, intern, attend conferences, comment on papers, blog, etcetera.\u201d</p> <p>Locke agrees that building a network of contacts early on will improve your chances of finding paid employment, \u201cso make the most of any placements you have, no matter how small or short term\u201d. </p> <p>\u201cDo network,\u201d echoes Toby Evans, head of liaison for recruiting group for Capita, and commands an <a href=\"http://www.army.mod.uk/reserve/31781.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">Army Reserve</a> training unit in his spare time. \u201cIt sounds dull, but if you are not rubbing shoulders with people in the industry, you won\u2019t learn about it or hear about the opportunities.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMake sure you keep the contact details so you know who to contact should further opportunities arise,\u201d adds Locke. \u201cAny experience you get will enable you to build up a portfolio of projects and transferable skills, possibly opening doors to permanent, paid positions.\u201d<br></p> <h2>Search high and low but don\u2019t just focus on the big organisations</h2> <p>When looking for jobs, Locke recommends scouring through newspapers and searching online job websites for positions with NGOs. \u201cPeople still find opportunities through word of mouth, so good networking skills are essential when you\u2019re looking for opportunities.\u201d She also suggests finding out if any local campaign organisations have national and international links that could prove useful.</p> <p>Also, while many graduates might be attracted to larger, more well-known aid organisations, never underestimate the value of smaller, community-based organisations. \u201cOften graduates aim for larger organisations that may be more difficult to break into,\u201d says Locke. \u201cTry to get as much experience as possible and be prepared to work long hours for little, or no, money in the initial stages.\u201d</p> <p>Tristan Shirley, a senior consultant for non-profit recruitment specialist <a href=\"https://prospect-us.co.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Prospectus</a>, recommends building core administrative skills by either interning or temping in the sector. He says this will \u201cdemonstrate your foundation level for the next post\u201d.</p> <h2>Keep fighting to breaking into the department you really want to work in </h2> <p>Experts agree that even if you have focused on work in one area of international development, there\u2019s still plenty of opportunity to achieve your ultimate ambition. </p> <p>Focus on networking and building relationships with people in the roles you\u2019d like to be in and with recruiters who fill those roles. Also, make sure your CV reflects the skills you have accumulated. </p> <p>\u201cTweak your CV to a skills-based CV and really focus on your transferable skills,\u201d says Lydia Fairman, a HR and resourcing specialist, who owns HR and recruitment consultancy, <a href=\"http://www.fairmanconsulting.co.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Fairman Consulting</a>. \u201cTake the time to tailor every application and approach you make, make every approach personal. You may be better off opening doors directly rather than using an agency, if they think it\u2019s going to be a more challenging sell for them. Network, network, network. Ask questions, build a rapport with the right people, and you will find you\u2019ve already got promising leads into a different direction from your contacts.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Opportunities aplenty for those with a legal background</strong></h2> <p>Those working in the legal industry but hoping to take their career out of the City and into the field, are welcomed by international aid organisations. \u201cA legal background should stand you in good stead for a variety of opportunities in the sector,\u201d says Fairman. \u201cMy best recommendation would be to try to get some work placements or volunteering under your belt first to get a feel for the kinds of roles that are out there, and a better idea of the direction you want to take. You\u2019ll find that way you begin to carve a route in and make some strong contacts while you learn.\u201d<br></p> <p>Humanitarian organisations need a surprising amount of legal advice, adds Macdonald. \u201cThey get some of that met pro bono by external firms, but will also retain their own legal staff both in their headquarters and local representation in other countries.

For EU and North American countries there is a concern about their role in dispensing funds for terrorism or in concealing the profits of violent crime. While in the global south, leaders are more concerned with economic justice and the development that greater tax receipts could fund.</p> <p>Some dismiss the proposal as idealistic after it was so <a href=\"http://www.ipsnews.net/2015/07/global-tax-body-sticking-point-at-financing-conference-in-addis/\">thoroughly quashed</a> last year. But Long pointed out that Ecuador had proved itself capable of similar feats of political persuasion in the recent past. It has clamped down hard on tax avoidance by its own citizens \u2013 tripling its tax take in the process, he said. And it successfully led the charge to <a href=\"https://business-humanrights.org/en/binding-treaty/un-human-rights-council-sessions\">create a binding UN instrument to bring transnational corporations to account</a> for human rights violations.</p> <p>\u201cThe whole UN system is based on bringing states to account. But in today\u2019s world it\u2019s not just states that violate human rights,\u201d said Long. \u201cWe in Ecuador know this. We\u2019ve had terrible human rights violations by multinationals.\u201d <br></p> <p>Last year Ecuador was given the mandate to preside over a committee which is drafting a law to hold multinationals that commit human rights offences to account. </p> <p>Long admitted that sufficient support for the creation of a new UN body wouldn\u2019t appear overnight but, he said, \u201cthere is a growing consensus that tax havens need to be tackled\u201d. He thought this week\u2019s UN meeting would be the \u201claunch of the final chapter in this fight. It\u2019s been an ongoing battle, but I think the time is right.\u201d </p> <p>Many studies have underlined the positive impact that shutting down tax havens could have for the developing world. <a href=\"http://www.international-adviser.com/news/1027020/inequality-tol-stay-tax-havens-oxfam#sthash.tkgphCFm.dpuf\">Oxfam estimates that</a> wealthy individuals hold $7.6tn offshore, and that the tax on that wealth could amount to $190bn annually. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2014/dec/18/developing-countries-debt-eurodad-report\">Developing countries lose $2 for every $1 gained, report says</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (Eclac) estimates that Latin America <a href=\"http://www.cepal.org/en/news/tax-evasion-latin-america-totals-340-billion-dollars-and-represents-67-regional-gdp\">loses $340bn a year</a> through tax evasion.</p> <p>Ecuador\u2019s own clampdown on tax avoidance has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2012/jan/19/ecuador-radical-exciting-place\">a success</a>. Long said that in 2006 tax returns amounted to $3.5bn a year, while at the close of 2014 they were up to $14.5bn.</p> <p>He stressed that the vast majority of the increase in returns is due to better collection rather than tax increases: \u201c92% of this increase is from greater efficiency, through greater transparency, and through fighting tax evasion and tax dodging.\u201d</p> <p>Setting up a UN body to regulate tax should help end the destructive competition between countries. There has long been a race to the bottom in the tax game, with countries offering ever lower tax rates, tax breaks and greater secrecy in order to attract multinationals and wealthy individuals. <br></p> <p>Long said that some countries have been victims of their own underdevelopment. \u201cSome island countries [that] have resorted to practices that are harmful to everybody \u2026 are themselves not necessarily extremely wealthy.\u201d</p> <p>He admitted that getting those countries on board would be challenging. \u201cWe need to plan a transition for them to move away from certain financial practices and \u2026 we need to convince them that we are not trying to threaten their economy or prosperity.\u201d <br></p> <p>If Long is able to secure a vote on the issue, it is likely to be decided on a simple majority. There may well be opposition: it was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jun/25/ten-reasons-why-european-governments-should-back-global-tax-body\">the EU who rejected the idea of a global tax body</a> at Addis Ababa in 2015, with the UK and France especially vocal against it.</p> <p>For Long to secure victory from last year\u2019s defeat he will need to make sure his own record on tax havens is exemplary: he is keenly aware that other <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/05/iceland-prime-minister-resigns-over-panama-papers-revelations\">politicians have not covered themselves in glory</a>.

  "<p>At midday on 31 August, a silent and subversive music event happened inside Parliament House. Milling among the gaggles of children on school excursion were about 15 unacquainted visitors distinguished by one thing: all wore earphones and walked the same route through the building\u2019s public zones.</p> <p>I was one of them. That morning, as instructed by the artists, I downloaded an album from Bandcamp called Kill Climate Deniers: Listening Party Mix and headed to Parliament House. I parked between gleaming government-issued cars, walked to the forecourt and pressed play. Over ambient sound came the disembodied voice of the Canberra musician Reuben Ingall. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/14/debunking-malcolm-roberts-the-case-against-a-climate-science-denier\">Debunking Malcolm Roberts: the case against a climate science denier</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThere are plain-clothed police officers patrolling every floor.

How does a normal person act? Be like that.\u201d</p> <p>Easier said than done. Ingall\u2019s concept album was based on a playscript called Kill Climate Deniers by the experimental theatremaker David Finnigan. The play is a hostage drama about an eco-terrorist attack on Parliament House with the tagline: \u201cWhat happens when the unstoppable force of climate change meets the immovable object of Australian politics?\u201d</p> <p>Even before the volley of gunfire during the song Music to Shoot Climate Activists To, Ingall\u2019s \u201cbangers\u201d were an unsettling score for a Parliament House stroll. His classic house and techno tracks expressed an abandon and depravity that was utterly incongruent with the civic fustiness of the meeting place of our nation.

It\u2019s an era thing, says Finnigan. \u201cIt\u2019s been 28 years since [Nasa scientist] James Hansen testified to the US Congress that climate change had commenced. Around that time Chicago house and Detroit techno arrived in the UK with all the cheap ecstasy and kicked off the second summer of love.\u201d</p> <p>Unlike a lot of current dancefloor music, these tracks aren\u2019t smart or self-referential. They are pure elation, pure escapism. If Nero were around, they\u2019d have been his jam as Rome burned. Which fits nicely with the extinction theme that Julian Hobba, artistic director of Aspen Island Theatre Company, sees as \u201cthe hard kernel sitting at the heart of the [Finnigan\u2019s] play\u201d. </p> <p>Hobba commissioned the work but it hasn\u2019t yet been performed as the traditional stage play it was written to be. In late 2014 the Herald Sun columnist Andrew Bolt discovered Finnigan had received funding from Arts ACT. Bolt hadn\u2019t read the play \u2013 it was still in development \u2013 but the title was enough. </p> <p>\u201cHow does the ACT government justify spending taxpayers\u2019 money on a theatre work entitled Kill Climate Deniers?\u201d <a href=\"http://www.heraldsun.com.au/blogs/andrew-bolt/act-government-donates--to-kill-climate-deniers-project/news-story/1dc34e7614ced0ca80939889403b6541\">he wrote</a>. \u201cWhat sane government donates to a project urging others to kill fellow citizens, even as a \u2018joke\u2019?\u201d</p> <p>Others decried it too, sight unseen.

He is out of money and says \u201cit can\u2019t be a shambolic, rough-as-guts first go because there is an audience waiting for it to fail\u201d. Instead, he has been folding the scandal back into the script, blurring fact and fiction in what he calls a \u201cconstantly evolving text\u201d.</p> <p>The play\u2019s provocative title and topic are necessary stimulants in the \u201ccalcified\u201d climate change debate, he says. \u201cIf I see an article with a climate headline, my eyes just slide right off,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I suspect that\u2019s a feature, not a bug, for the organisations who\u2019ve spent a lot of money muddying the water with absurd technical falsehoods.

Then we have the massive, abstract, global phenomena of climate change, unfolding over a span of decades. The tools are manifestly unfit to deal with the problem.\u201d </p> <p>He is right. Driving to Canberra for the listening party, I realised I had no idea of the major political parties\u2019 policies on climate change, even though an election campaign had just lapsed. It was the second sitting day of parliament yet I heard nothing about the environment. There was talk of new, even more alarming data on the Great Barrier Reef but according to Finnigan, data doesn\u2019t help anymore. </p> <p>\u201cThe assumption by the scientific community in the 90s was that all people needed was the evidence, provided clearly and straightforwardly,\u201d he says. \u201cNow we know about confirmation bias and the echo chamber effect and we can see evidence is never going to be enough to change people\u2019s minds. What a thing, if that\u2019s true! Climate scientists back in the 80s would shake their heads in disbelief if you told them that.\u201d</p> <p>Finnigan has plans for a solo show of Kill Climate Deniers at festivals in 2017 but he\u2019s trying not to overthink the next instalment. \u201cThere\u2019s a degree to which these project evolutions should be intuitive and driven by excitement and urgency, not market research.

  "<p>\u201cWe are all micro mine owners.\u201d<br></p> <p>This is the mantra preached by Veena Sahajwalla, a materials scientist at the University of New South Wales who wants to fundamentally change how we perceive our electronic waste: not as trash, but as treasure. </p> <p>Electronic waste, or \u201ce-waste\u201d, is full of valuable resources: a tonne of mobile phones, which is roughly equivalent to 6,000 handsets, contains about 130kg of copper, more than 3kg of silver, 340 grams of gold and 140 grams of another precious material known as palladium. </p> <p>\u201cWe have almost 25m mobile phones just in Australia,\u201d says Sahajwalla. \u201cAnd these are the ones not in use.\u201d Add to that the huge numbers of TVs, computers, tablets and appliances laying around our homes and that\u2019s a lot of opportunity. Unfortunately, we\u2019re not capitalising. </p> <p>Globally e-waste is an intensifying problem. Between 2009 and 2014, the amount of e-waste generated worldwide doubled, hitting 42m metric tonnes per year. According to a report by the United Nations University, the combined estimated value of the resources embedded in that waste was A$69bn (US$52bn). </p> <p>Yet <a href=\"http://unu.edu/media-relations/releases/discarded-kitchen-laundry-bathroom-equipment-comprises-over-half-of-world-e-waste-unu-report.html#info\" rel=\"nofollow\">less than one-sixth was diverted</a> to proper recycling plants.</p> <p>E-waste is challenging to recycle because it contains a spectrum of mixed resources, but also toxins such as mercury, arsenic, chromium and lead.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/sep/12/energy-storage-how-an-abandoned-goldmine-will-be-converted-into-a-world-first\">Energy storage: how an abandoned goldmine will be converted into a world first</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Australia is one of the world\u2019s largest generators of e-waste, producing more than 15.2kg per inhabitant each year. Regionally, Oceania is second only to Europe in that metric.</p> <p>Safe recycling of e-waste in Australia has traditionally been limited to high-cost, industrial-scale smelting facilities. Despite efforts to improve management, huge amounts of e-waste still end up in landfill, where toxins can leach into the environment, contaminating soil and groundwater, and posing public health risks. The charity <a href=\"http://www.cleanup.org.au/au/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Clean Up</a> estimates that just 10% of the seven million TVs and computers purchased each year in Australia are recycled correctly.</p> <p>Large amounts of e-waste are also exported from industrial economies like Australia to the developing world, where regulations are less stringent. In some places, these hazardous materials are processed by labourers in unsafe working conditions.</p> <p>Sahajwalla wants to make e-waste processing safer and more profitable. As part of her Australian Research Council laureate fellowship, she\u2019s developing the fundamental science to transform the resources in e-waste into a range of valuable products.</p> <p>She is currently developing the prototype for a low-cost alternative to industrial-scale smelting, which will be based at UNSW. The concept is simple yet innovative: portable micro-factories, roughly the size of a shipping container, which can be deployed at collection sites in suburbs, remote communities and throughout the developing world. Sahajwalla is collaborating with industry on the project.</p> <p>These micro-factories will churn out high-value metal alloys, ceramics, composites and nanomaterials, while simultaneously eliminating any hazardous impact. As the materials already have market value, they could benefit niche manufacturers producing everything from jewellery to marine hardware, says Sahajwalla.</p> <p>The technical challenge is what Sahajwalla calls selective thermal transformations: working out how to create the valuable products efficiently using precisely controlled, high-temperature chemical reactions in a small-scale furnace.</p> <p>If her team can overcome the hurdles, the benefits are clear: micro-factories decentralise recycling, allowing e-waste to be processed locally where it\u2019s collected. This helps eliminate emissions associated with shipping the waste across huge distances to recycling plants.</p> <p>Sahajwalla says large-scale smelters have a high energy cost because they need to extract metal from ore bodies, which have been produced from upstream mining activities. \u201cParts of what we are processing start their life in an e-waste, in a metallic form,\u201d says Sahajwalla. \u201cSo you\u2019re saving on energy to begin with.

What we need is some serious research that can tell us how much is collected, how much is recycled,\u201d she says. </p> <p>Metternicht says portable micro-factories are a \u201cgreat plan\u201d and should be considered, but they need to be affordable. </p> <p>With the design process still under way, Sahajwalla says the price tag for micro-factories is not yet clear, but maintains she\u2019s committed to providing a low-cost, accessible option. \u201cIf we can develop these affordable and sustainable solutions, that may well be the tipping point for how it becomes possible for a lot of developing regions to be more safely processing their e-waste.\u201d </p>",

Not knowing when it\u2019s going to come down translates as not knowing where its going to come down.\u201d</p> <p>McDowell said a slight change in atmospheric conditions could nudge the landing site \u201cfrom one continent to the next\u201d.<br></p> <p>While most of the eight tonnes of space station would melt as it passes through the atmosphere, McDowell said some parts, such as the rocket engines, were so dense that they wouldn\u2019t burn up completely. <br></p> <p>\u201cThere will be lumps of about 100kg or so, still enough to give you a nasty wallop if it hit you,\u201d he said.<br></p> <p>\u201cYes there\u2019s a chance it will do damage, it might take out someone\u2019s car, there will be a rain of a few pieces of metal, it might go through someone\u2019s roof, like if a flap fell off a plane, but it is not widespread damage.\u201d<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"97f05c81af9b1abba17f69ec2af8e7aa5472dc2a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/97f05c81af9b1abba17f69ec2af8e7aa5472dc2a/0_0_3528_2116/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Chinese astronaut Liu Yang of the Tiangong-1 mission poses for photographs during the opening ceremony of an exhibition on China\u2019s first space station in 2012.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chinese astronaut Liu Yang of the Tiangong-1 mission poses for photographs during the opening ceremony of an exhibition on China\u2019s first space station in 2012.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><br></p> <p>Wu Ping, the space official, told reporters the lab \u2013 which was launched into space <a href=\"http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/china/2011-09/29/c_131168235.htm\">amid great fanfare</a> in September 2011 \u2013 had made \u201cimportant contributions to China\u2019s manned space cause\u201d during its four and a half years of service.</p> <p>She claimed its return to earth was \u201cunlikely to affect aviation activities or cause damage to the ground\u201d. </p> <p>\u201cChina has always highly valued the management of space debris, conducting research and tests on space debris mitigation and cleaning,\u201d Wu said, according to Xinhua. </p> <p>Wu said Tiangong-1 was \u201ccurrently intact\u201d and that authorities would \u201ccontinue to monitor [it] and strengthen early warning for possible collision with objects.\u201d </p> <p>\u201cIf necessary, China will release a forecast of its falling and report it internationally,\u201d she added. </p> <p>Space enthusiasts who have been monitoring Tiangong-1, and attempting to draw attention to its plight, fear there is a risk \u2013 albeit small \u2013 that pieces of the falling lab could cause damage back on earth.<br></p> <p>\u201cIt could be a real bad day if pieces of this came down in a populated area,\u201d Thomas Dorman, an amateur astronomer who has been attempting to track the missing lab, was <a href=\"http://www.space.com/33140-china-tiangong-1-space-lab-falling-to-earth.html\">quoted as saying</a> by the space.com website in June. </p> <p>China\u2019s first space lab was most likely to land in the ocean or in an uninhabited area, Dorman admitted. </p> <p>\u201cBut remember \u2013 sometimes, the odds just do not work out, so this may bear watching.\u201d</p>",

Considering the recent political news involving debates over the acceptance of refugees from the Syrian civil war, it\u2019s relevant reading:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> I came to the United States as a refugee when I was 11 years old. My father was a diplomat and a strong supporter of democracy in Czechoslovakia, so when the Communists took over, we were forced into exile as refugees. In November 1948, we were welcomed to the United States of America.</p> <p>Becoming a US citizen is the most important thing that ever happened to me. My father said that when we were in Europe during WWII people would say, \u2018We are sorry for your troubles and hope that you have everything you need; by the way, when will you be leaving to go back home?\u2019</p> <p>But in America, people said: \u2018We are sorry for your troubles and hope that you have everything you need; by the way, when will you become a citizen?\u2019</p> <p>America resettles more refugees than any other nation because it reflects one of our noblest traditions as a nation: providing support to those who are most vulnerable.</p> <p>With the world facing the largest mass displacement on record since World War II, it has never been more important for world leaders to follow America\u2019s example and work together to do more to support refugees....</p> <p>When countries with insufficient resources take in refugees, it creates more instability, not just at the frontlines of this crisis, but around the world. If we were to slam the door in the faces of refugees with certain religious backgrounds, we would defy our history and our principles of pluralism and diversity. As we talk to other nations about what more needs to be done to tackle this crisis, it\u2019s important that President Obama is setting this example.</p> <p>When I came here as a child, I will never forget sailing into New York Harbor for the first time and beholding the Statute of Liberty. I did not have to face refugee camps or the kind of danger that many refugees endure. But like all refugees, I shared a hope to live a safe life with dignity and a chance to give back to my new country.</p> <p>Together, we can help refugees rebuild their lives and live with dignity once again.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57e1a621e4b0603ea33c4669\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-20T21:18:18.009Z\">10.18pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Fox News talking head Sean Hannity\u2019s outspoken and material support for Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has reached another milestone today, with the release of an eight-minute promotional video for the nominee in which Hannity makes an appearance.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0J_EKmvYZk\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/k0J_EKmvYZk?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Hannity, whose eponymous program has long been a favorite slot for Trump to answer softball questions and for the duo to <a href=\"https://vine.co/v/OeF3QBlnwlV\">soak up each others\u2019 awesomeness</a>, arrives about six minutes into #HEARTLAND4TRUMP, a promotional video studded with testimonials about the Republican nominee:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>One of the reasons I\u2019m supporting Donald Trump this year is, number one, he\u2019s going to put originalists on the supreme court - people that believe in fidelity to the constitution, separation of powers, co-equal branches of government.</p> <p>He\u2019s a guy that will vet refugees to keep Americans safe.</p> <p>And, of course, he\u2019s gonna build that wall.

They have a right to be concerned about this. Marriage equality advocates are also concerned.</p> <p>The plebiscite legislation is completely silent on how religious freedom would be maintained should the laws defining marriage change.

In New South Wales we approved same-sex adoption in the parliament. We dealt carefully with issues of religious freedom. We managed a civil, respectful and thorough debate. Labor and Liberal MPs exercised a free vote in the parliament. The outcome was accepted by the public. The matter is done. No one today is trying to overturn the law.</p> <p>The same would be true of a parliamentary vote on marriage equality.</p> <p>The churches cheer Abbott and Turnbull to a same-sex marriage plebiscite at their peril.

  "<p>Fending off several controversies on Tuesday, Donald Trump started another when he proclaimed at a North Carolina rally that \u201cour African American communities are in the worst shape they\u2019ve ever been ...

The tweet set off a major firestorm and even the candy maker distanced itself from it with a spokesperson saying: \u201cSkittles are candy. Refugees are people.\u201d Trump Jr followed up on Tuesday morning when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/20/donald-trump-jr-skittles-tweet-hunting\">he shared an article</a> from a far right wing website that claimed, without evidence, that \u201ctens of thousands\u201d of British women have been tortured and raped by gangs \u201ccomprised almost exclusively of Muslims\u201d.</p> <p>The firestorm caused by the younger Trump\u2019s tweet even forced a response from running mate Mike Pence who told NBC News\u2019s Kelly O\u2019Donnell in an interview: \u201cIt is remarkable to me to see the level of outrage about a metaphor used by Don Jr, when Hillary Clinton\u2019s calling for a 550% increase in the Syrian refugee program.\u201d </p> <p>Trump\u2019s comments on Tuesday came against the backdrop of another fatal shooting by police of an unarmed black man, this time in Oklahoma.

As a result, Trump <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/778238281196662784\">jibed on Twitter</a>: \u201cHillary Clinton is taking the day off again, she needs the rest.
