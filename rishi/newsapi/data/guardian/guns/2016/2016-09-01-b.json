  "<p>The home secretary has been urged to take immediate action over the 387 refugee children in Calais who have a right to come to Britain.</p> <p>The list of eligible children who are stuck in the camps in Calais has been drawn up by Citizens UK and given to Amber Rudd, and the demand for immediate action endorsed by Alf Dubs \u2013 the Labour peer and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/04/britain-failing-child-refugees-europe-help-them-fast\">long-time refugee campaigner</a>.</p> <p>It comes as a group of more than 100 faith leaders, council chiefs and celebrities, including Juliet Stevenson and Vanessa Redgrave, prepare to gather outside the Home Office on Friday at a memorial event marking the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/04/alan-kurdi-turkish-court-jails-pair-syrian-toddler-death-trafficking\">anniversary of the death of Alan Kurdi</a>, the three-year-old Syrian boy whose body was washed up on a beach in Turkey.</p> <p>The plea for urgent action on child refugees in Calais also comes as a freedom of information request has revealed that the government spent more than \u00a3100,000 earlier this year in legal fees to make it harder to reunite refugees in Calais with their families in Britain.</p> <p>The list of 387 refugee children eligible to come to Britain is made up of the names of 178 children who have a right to come to the UK because of their close family links in the country and a further 209 children who qualify under the terms of the \u201cDubs\u201d amendment accepted by the government in March earlier this year.</p> <p>Lord Dubs said: \u201cI am deeply saddened that despite repeated calls from me and others the government still seems to be dragging its feet on the commitments made when the amendment in my name was accepted.</p> <p>\u201cNow that the new government has had some weeks to settle in after the EU referendum vote there really is no excuse for any further delay. Theresa May and Amber Rudd should be taking immediate action.\u201d</p> <p>Citizens UK says that to date the only children transferred from France to Britain have been those with family in the UK, largely involving those supported by its Safe Passage partnership: \u201cThis process takes months and at the present rate it will take over a year to help the 178 children identified,\u201d said a Citizens UK statement. \u201cTo date not one child has been transferred from France to Britain under the wider provisions of the Dubs amendment.\u201d</p> <p>A Home Office spokesperson said that more than 30 under-18s have been accepted for transfer within Europe since the Immigration Act 2016, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/27/peer-condemns-shocking-delays-over-help-for-unaccompanied-child-refugees\">which includes the Dubs amendment</a>, reached the statute book in May and the majority had already arrived. A total of 120 unaccompanied children had been \u201caccepted for transfer\u201d under the Dublin III regulations since the start of the year.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"869fe92d056fcf8cc416ed73ff8bf04b2ff9fafd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/869fe92d056fcf8cc416ed73ff8bf04b2ff9fafd/0_0_4096_2715/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Amber Rudd\" width=\"1000\" height=\"663\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Amber Rudd, the home secretary, has faced calls to help house the children in Calais.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Heathcliff O'Malley/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cOur priority is to protect the best interests of children who are in need of our help. Last year there were over 3,000 claims for asylum in the UK by unaccompanied children, in addition to those who were already being cared for in the UK,\u201d said the Home Office spokesperson. \u201cWhile these children have made it to the UK, they still need support and we still need local authorities to agree to care for them.\u201d</p> <p>They added that they were in talks with the United Nations high commissioner for refugees, other partner organisations and the Italian, Greek and French governments to speed up mechanisms to identify, assess and transfer unaccompanied refugee children to Britain.</p> <p>\u201cWe continue to work closely with the French government to ensure that children in Calais with family links in the UK are identified, receive sufficient support and can access the Dublin family reunification process without delay,\u201d he added.</p> <p>But actor and campaigner Stevenson said the government had not shown the generosity to refugees it should. She said: \u201cOn this painful anniversary, when we remember a tiny Syrian boy lying drowned on a Turkish beach, a death which shook the world, it would be appropriate for the prime minister and home secretary to act to help stranded refugee children. We are only talking about fewer than 400 children. How can it be argued that Britain cannot cope in providing new homes for these children?\u201d</p> <p>Bishop Peter Hill, the Bishop of Barking, who visited Calais last week, added: \u201cI appeal to ministers to look into their hearts and take immediate action to bring these children to safety. It has been established that the UK has a legal obligation to these children, but more to the point, this country has a moral obligation.\u201d</p> <p>The government legal department\u2019s FoI response showed that more than \u00a365,000 was spent on barristers\u2019 fees and a further \u00a339,000 on \u201cinternal costs\u201d in successfully challenging an<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/02/uk-home-office-wins-appeal-against-ruling-four-syrian-refugees-calais-camp\"> immigration tribunal ruling</a> earlier this year that three Syrian teenagers and a 26-year-old man should immediately be brought to Britain and reunited with their families.</p> <p>But the information commissioner has had to step in and demand that the Home Office responds within 35 days to an FoI request asking for details of how many refugees have been transferred to the UK under the Dublin arrangements for family reunion in the past 12 months.</p> <p>Labour MPs will also press the home secretary on Monday for faster progress on child refugees and are expected to publish further legislation that would try to secure the removal of the children from the Calais camps before Christmas.</p>",
  "<p>Andy Murray was pleased to come through a difficult period against Marcel Granollers as he recorded <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/01/andy-murray-marcel-granollers-us-open-straight-sets-flushing-meadows-roof\" title=\"\">his second successive straight-sets win</a> to reach the third round of the US Open.</p> <p>\u201cThere was a 20- to 25-minute period in the match where it was tough and tricky,\u201d he said of his 6-4, 6-1, 6-4 win in two hours and 22 minutes over the Spaniard under the roof on Arthur Ashe on day four. That followed his opening win in similarly convincing fashion against the altogether different skills of Lukas Rosol on Monday.</p> <p>He added: \u201cI got myself in a situation that maybe I could have avoided if I had taken one or two of the set points that I had at 5-2 or 5-3. But I thought I did pretty well. There were some good points in there. That period of the match was very tough. I didn\u2019t play that well during that period and managed to come through it, thankfully, and play some good stuff in the second and third sets.</p> <p>\u201cI served at like 40, 42% first serves or something and still won in straight sets. I must have been doing things well other than serving. I was obviously hitting the ball pretty well and returning pretty good. But I could serve better, for sure. I only got broken once in a game where I had game points. It was all right.\u201d</p> <p>Murray said playing under the new roof provided some new challenges \u2013 not the least of them having to pick up the sound of the ball against the background of an echo in the cavernous stadium.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think it was too different to the other night when I played but, when the rain came, it was certainly loud. You can\u2019t hear anything, really. You could hear the line calls, but not so much the opponent\u2019s [shots] when he was hitting the ball or even when you\u2019re hitting the ball, really, which is tough purely because we\u2019re not used to it. That\u2019s what makes it challenging.</p> <p>\u201cWe use our ears when we play. It\u2019s not just the eyes. It helps us pick up the speed of the ball, the spin that\u2019s on the ball, how hard someone\u2019s hitting it. If we played with our ears covered or with headphones on, it would be a big advantage if your opponent wasn\u2019t wearing them. It\u2019s tricky. You know, you can still do it but it\u2019s harder, for sure.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s definitely louder [than Wimbledon] but I don\u2019t think it changed the conditions on the court as much as it does at Wimbledon.</p> <p>\u201cWhen the roof is on, the humidity picks up significantly [at Wimbledon], whereas here it\u2019s always humid, even when the roof is open.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/obama-administration\">Obama administration</a> has insisted that the terms of a nuclear agreement signed last year with Iran were being upheld after a Washington think tank alleged that Tehran had been granted secret exemptions. </p> <p><a href=\"http://file///Downloads/Internet%20Downloads/JCPOA%20Exemptions%20Revealed_1Sept2016_Final1.pdf\">A report</a> by the Institute for Science and International Security alleged that a joint commission set up to implement the Vienna deal had allowed Iran to keep more than the agreed maximum of 300 kg of low enriched uranium (LEU) by excluding waste material in Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities. If enriched further, LEU could be used in a nuclear warhead.</p> <p> The institute\u2019s director and co-author of the report, David Albright, said that this and other exemptions were granted by the commission in secret. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/18/life-iranians-nuclear-deal\">After the nuclear deal, the west should not disappoint Iranians for the third time | Saeed Kamali Dehghan</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cOne of the biggest problems is we are being denied information in these cases,\u201d Albright said. \u201cIf the joint commission has so many powers to change this deal, shouldn\u2019t we know what they\u2019re doing?\u201d</p> <p>The state department denied that the 300 kg LEU limit set down in the agreement, known as the Joint Comprehensive Programme of Action (JCPOA), had been breached. </p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s been no loosening of the commitments and Iran has not and will not under the JCPOA be allowed to exceed the limits that are spelled out in the JCPOA,\u201d spokesman John Kirby said.</p> <p>He added the only violation of the terms of the deal had been a temporary surplus in Iran\u2019s export of heavy water (which can be used in nuclear reactors to produce plutonium), but that had been corrected.</p> <p>Kirby also said the secrecy of the work of the joint commission, which represents all parties to the deal, was stipulated in last year\u2019s deal, signed by six world powers (the US, UK, France, Germany, Russia and China), the EU and Iran.</p> <p>\u201cThis is in compliance with the JCPOA which says the commission\u2019s work should be confidential unless all parties agree otherwise,\u201d Kirby said. </p> <p>However, while he repeatedly stated there had no been \u201cno exceptions\u201d to the quantitative limits set down in the agreement, Kirby did not respond directly to the question of exemptions.</p> <p>Albright\u2019s report claimed certain waste products and residues were not being included in the joint commission\u2019s inventory of nuclear materials.

They can be used to separate plutonium from spent fuel on a small scale. </p> <p>Kirby noted that the joint commission was given the authority to approve larger hot cells than envisaged in the agreement. </p> <p>\u201cWe aren\u2019t saying anything has been violated here,\u201d Albright said. \u201cBut the number of these hot cells is surprising. We don\u2019t know how many are being monitored by the IAEA [International Atomic Energy Agency], and again, why is this secret?\u201d</p> <p>Jim Walsh, an international security expert at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said that it was the norm for arms control agreements to have secret sections. </p> <p>\u201cSecret doesn\u2019t mean evil. It\u2019s just standard operating procedure, and as this report says itself, Obama notified Congress. Congress has known this from the beginning,\u201d Walsh said. On the question of the \u201chot cells\u201d, Walsh added: \u201cThe report admits these are being used for producing medical isotopes. There is no plutonium reactor in Iran. A reactor is years away, so allowing the existing hot cells is not a proliferation danger.\u201d </p> <p>James Acton, the co-director of the nuclear policy programme at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said: \u201cThe more complicated and comprehensive your arms control agreement, the more questions it throws up in implementation.</p> <p>\u201cUnder the Chemical Weapons Convention, the US had to destroy its stockpile by 2012, but it wasn\u2019t possible to meet that deadline. People didn\u2019t see that as an attempt to undermine the convention, and a pragmatic solution was found,\u201d Acton said. \u201cThere is the same principle at work here.\u201d </p>",

  "<p>The Boston law firm representing dozens of alleged victims of sex abuse at an elite Rhode Island boarding school released a long awaited <a href=\"https://sgsinvestigationdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/report-of-independent-investigator-martin-murphy-with-exhibits.pdf\">investigation</a> on Thursday detailing more than 60 alleged incidents of sexual abuse at St George\u2019s school, and accusing six faculty and staff members by name of crimes ranging from molestation to rape.</p> <p>The report comes eight months after Anne Scott, an alumnus, told the Boston Globe that a former athletic trainer, Al Gibbs, had raped her when she was 15 years old. The story unleashed a cascade of accusations from former students, many of them decades removed from St George\u2019s, who said they, too, were raped and sexually abused by members of the school\u2019s faculty or staff. On St George\u2019s campus, it sent administrators on a scramble to uncover the extent of the abuse and the institution\u2019s share of blame.</p> <p>In early August, nearly 30 St George\u2019s alumni <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/03/rhode-island-boarding-school-sexual-abuse-settlement\">entered a settlement agreement with the school</a>, although the terms and finances involved have not been made public.</p> <p>Thursday\u2019s report details a torrent of new accusations that school officials repeatedly failed to act in the protection of students. </p> <p>Many of the new revelations pertain to Gibbs, the athletic trainer, whom the school fired in early 1980. One out of every five girls who was a student at St George\u2019s between 1972 and 1979 reported sexual abuse by Gibbs, and the investigation estimated that \u201cthe number of women who were actually abused by Gibbs substantially exceeds the reported figure\u201d.</p> <p>Alumni had previously alleged that St George\u2019s headmaster in the 1970s and 80s, Anthony Zane, failed to fire Gibbs until multiple people complained. (Katie Wales, an alumnus who reported Gibbs, claims Zane told her the abuse was in her head.) But the report found that Zane and the school board gave Gibbs a letter of recommendation and a financial reward for his service that lasted until Gibbs\u2019s death in 1996. </p> <p>\u201cThe school\u2019s treatment of Gibbs in the years after his termination, continuing to his death in 1996, reflected, at best, serious misjudgment, and at worst, callous indifference to the girls and young women the school knew he had abused,\u201d the report concluded.</p> <p>The report is the handiwork of Martin Murphy of the Foley Hoag law firm in Boston, who, along with several colleagues, interviewed more than 150 witnesses and read thousands of internal documents. Murphy\u2019s investigation, which was commissioned by the school and an alumni survivors group, took on an added prominence after St George\u2019s was seen as sabotaging its own effort to set up an independent inquiry. The school placed a Boston lawyer in charge of that inquiry, without disclosing that she was the law partner and wife of the attorney representing St George\u2019s in the abuse cases.</p> <p>The school\u2019s investigation found about two dozen students who were abused by six school employees. St George\u2019s terminated most of the abusers, but did so without reporting the crimes in a way that would prevent them from continuing to work with children. </p> <p>Murphy\u2019s investigation expands the number of known accusers of faculty and staff members to 51, and identifies 10 alleged abusers, six by name. Another 10 students were abused by their peers.</p> <p>\u201cMany of these students remember St George\u2019s as a place where their abusers created a kind of private hell for them \u2013 a place where they suffered trauma and emotional wounds that, for many, remain unhealed,\u201d the report read. \u201cThe abuse they experienced involved not only physical acts of sexual assault (as horrible as those were), but something that, for many, was even worse: betrayal at the hands of an adult entrusted with their care, at a school where they saw few, if any, places to turn for help.\u201d</p> <p>Three of the accused named in the report \u2013 Rev Howard White, an associate chaplain; Franklin Coleman, a music teacher and choirmaster; and Timothy Tefft, an English teacher \u2013 went on to teach at other schools after they were terminated from or left St George\u2019s. Tefft is serving a prison sentence for child pornography. White and Coleman have declined to comment for the duration of the investigation. </p> <p>Others accused include Susan Goddard, a former school nurse who allegedly had sexual contact with a student in 1979 and 1980, and William Lydgate, a former English student. Neither could be immediately reached for comment.</p> <p>Most of the accusations date back decades, well beyond the statute of limitations. But several alumni claimed they were abused in the 2000s. And the report raises questions about how the school\u2019s current headmaster reacted in 2004 when students accused Charles Thompson, a teacher, of touching their legs. The report asserted that Thompson should have been fired, rather than placed on leave. </p> <p>The headmaster, Eric F Peterson, announced in June that he would step down, following months of alumni pressure for him to resign.</p> <p>Regarding another administrator, Robert Weston, who was accused of inappropriate behavior and suspended, Murphy found no evidence to substantiate the allegations against him. The chair of the St George\u2019s board of trustees said Weston was welcome to return to his position.</p> <p>St George\u2019s joins a number of elite east coast boarding schools reeling from revelations of widespread and pervasive sexual abuse. The scale of this scandal rivals that of Horace Mann school in New York, where almost three dozen cases of abuse took place in the 1970s.</p> <p>But Scott, the alumnus who was raped by Gibbs, and an attorney for some of the accusers, Eric MacLeish, made clear that they were satisfied with the changes made to St George\u2019s policies toward sexual abuse in recent years.</p> <p>\u201cThe St George\u2019s community is full of wonderful and caring people,\u201d Scott said, adding that her survivors\u2019 group is aiding the search for the next head of the school and reviewing the school\u2019s abuse, assault, harassment and bullying problems.</p> <p>\u201cSt George\u2019s today is a very different school from the one portrayed in this report,\u201d said MacLeish, who is also an alumnus of St George\u2019s. \u201cNo parent should hesitate to send their child to an institution to this school, which has state of the art practices and policies designed to protect children.\u201d</p>",

He doesn\u2019t know where he\u2019s going, or how to switch on the cab\u2019s off-duty light. People get in, he politely asks them to get out \u2013 Naz K ain\u2019t no Travis B, it would appear. Things look up when a \u201cmad female\u201d gets in and asks to be taken to the beach. Now it doesn\u2019t seem to matter so much that Naz isn\u2019t going to make the party.</p> <p>They don\u2019t get to the beach, but to the river, by a bridge, where they pop pills under a full moon. Then they go back to her beautiful brownstone for tequila shots, cocaine, the knife game (a bit like Russian roulette only with knife and hand on table instead of gun against temple). And sex.</p> <p>But the best night of Naz\u2019s life soon turns into the worst when he wakes, blurry-headed, in the early morning to find her dead, with multiple stab wounds. Naz remains free for a while, but is then picked up for a traffic offence (another wrong turn, at a junction, in his life \u2013 understandable in the circumstances). Lovely, doe-eyed Naz is now chief, and only, suspect in the murder of Andrea Cornish (she only gets a name posthumously). Suddenly so much that has come before \u2013 CCTV at the tunnel, a garage stop, an unpleasant encounter on the street \u2013 takes on enormous significance; what seemed like random events, part of Naz\u2019s night out, now look like a big pile of evidence against him, in court. DNA isn\u2019t doing him any favours either. Or the knife in his pocket.</p> <p>The Night Of has moved on from procedural crime drama to something more about the randomness of justice, with a lot of the brilliant first series of the Serial podcast about it (the fact that Naz is from a Pakistani-American family adds to this).</p> <p>The sharp-eyed television addict will also recognise that it is based on the first series of the BBC\u2019s also brilliant Criminal Justice, written by Peter Moffat. But Richard Price and Steven Zaillian\u2019s adaptation, taking in a new city, new prejudices, post-9/11 Islamophobia etc, more than justifies its existence and makes it a thing in its own right. A very excellent thing. With a hypnotic performance from Riz Ahmed as a young man whose world is closing in on him, doors slamming with metallic clunks. Excellence, also, from Bill Camp as the weary cop in no doubt about whodunnit; and from John Turturro as the scruffy, scratchy (he has eczema) just-about-a-lawyer who appoints himself to Naz\u2019s defence and who we\u2019ll be seeing a lot more of as this gets into the legal nitty-gritty.</p> <p>A Guardian moan: that the one major female character is horribly and graphically killed off, less than half an hour in. It gets a bit better, with Naz\u2019s mother, who will become a bigger and stronger as this goes on; also the prosecutor and other female lawyers. And did the racist outburst (\u201cdid you leave your bombs at home, Mustafa?\u201d) have to come from an African American, who also happens to be a big-time weed enthusiast? Hmmm, objection slightly sustained, though there are also African Americans who are neither racists nor stoners, like the excellent traffic cop (also, undeniably, a woman, though, also undeniably, a relatively minor character).</p> <p>Moans over. The Night Of looks stunning. Is there maybe a little nod to Scorsese in this opener, nighttime Manhattan lights at taxi cruising speed, windscreen reflection, rear-view glances, Ahmed a 21st-century De Niro? There\u2019s a zooming in and out focusing thing going on \u2013 are you lookin\u2019 at this right here, or that back there? \u2013 that is utilised to the limit (OK, I got a little weary of it). But it adds to the feeling of dazzled confusion when a frightened young man is suddenly caught in the headlights on the road to hell.</p> <p>Is Naz innocent, though? We know stabbed her once, even if she was egging him on, in knifey-foreplay. And he was on a cocktail of unfamiliar class As. Could he have done it in a crazy drugged-up frenzy, and then forgotten about it? Or not forgotten about it ... One thing I do know: I\u2019m hooked.</p>",

For thousands of years they\u2019ve lived on <em>Noongar boodjar</em> (Noongar country), what is now known as the south-western corner of Western Australia and includes the capital city, Perth. Artefacts likely carried by early Noongar ancestors <a href=\"http://www.news.uwa.edu.au/201211055167/features/indigenous-people-use-science-investigate-their-heritage\">have been dated as far back as 30,000 years</a>.</p> <p>The Noongarpedia project began in 2014 by a team from the University of Western Australia led by school of Indigenous studies professor and Noongar elder Leonard Collard, with Curtin University\u2019s John Hartley and the Miles Franklin award-winning novelist Kim Scott. Although not yet formally launched,<a href=\"https://incubator.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wp/nys/Main_Page\"> the site is live</a> and users can create an account and contribute by writing or editing articles.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/feb/23/ernie-dingo-and-richard-walley-on-the-40th-year-of-their-welcome-to-country\">Ernie Dingo and Richard Walley on the 40th year of their welcome to country</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Its front page bears a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/feb/23/ernie-dingo-and-richard-walley-on-the-40th-year-of-their-welcome-to-country\">welcome to country</a>, an ancient spiritual greeting practised by many Indigenous Australian nations:<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><em><strong>Kaya wanju gnullar NoongarPedia. </strong></em><em><strong>Gnullar waarnkniy kwop kwop birdiyah wiern, maaman, yorga, koorlinga. </strong></em><em><strong>Gnullar waarnkiny noonar yoorl koorliny waarnkiny nidja NoongarPedia.</strong></em> / Welcome to our Noongarpedia. We speak in good spirit of our ancestors, spirits, men, women and children. We hope you come and contribute to our Noongarpedia.</p> </blockquote> <p>It is just one of many subtle but important departures from the larger Wikipedias. For example, Collard says inherent to English Wikipedia is an assumption that \u201call information is freely available to everybody\u201d. Such a policy would conflict with Noongar knowledge convention and law which places restrictions on who can know what knowledge, so the Noongarpedia community is developing procedures to prevent general access to certain information.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0d6271ac91e052ca20ff7f1065b870ec1a6c1581\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0d6271ac91e052ca20ff7f1065b870ec1a6c1581/0_0_2107_1416/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Noongar dancers perform a welcome dance on the steps of Western Australia\u2019s Parliament House in Perth\" width=\"1000\" height=\"672\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Noongar dancers perform a welcome dance on the steps of Western Australia\u2019s Parliament House in Perth.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Denise Cahill/AAP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A research associate, Jennifer Buchanan, says Wikipedia convention favours mainstream books, newspapers and scientific journals as creditable sources. For the Noongar people, while published works are also important, their elders are considered the greatest authority in knowledge and culture (meanwhile, inaccuracies about their people run rampant in the media and academic circles).<br></p> <p>One of the largest challenges the team face is that Wikipedia is primarily text-based. Until recent times Noongar has only ever been an oral language. There is no standard spelling of Noongar words, but its written form is now being developed through institutions like the Noongar Boodjar Language Centre in Bunbury. The team are also investigating how audio and video can be used to reflect the importance of oral testimony in their culture.</p> <p>So far the Noongarpedia has been written in both Noongar and English to accommodate for the varying levels of fluency by its users and to serve as a resource for language students. Buchanan says \u201cthe historical and political context of Noongar language use, loss and regeneration is a constant and pressing consideration in this project\u201d.</p> <p>The team hold monthly \u201c<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/NoongarPedia-925565157522262/events\">Noongarpedia Wikibombs</a>\u201d where people gather to edit and write articles, share ideas and are trained to use the site. One session was themed <em>Kadadjiny kura yeye boorda</em>: acknowledging our ways of learning from the past, today and future.</p> <p>Buchanan says: \u201cOne of the exciting elements of Web 2.0 platforms like Wikipedia is that they provide an opportunity for people to not only consume knowledge produced by others, much the same way as books offer, but also become producers themselves.\u201d</p> <p>The Noongarpedia is essentially an exploration of what life Noongar knowledge and language can take online. For Buchanan, language is \u201ca living, adaptable and changing thing that exists in its uses, not as a heritage language for preservation. We want to face the future.\u201d</p> <p>A <a href=\"http://noongarboodjar.com.au/\">Noongar Boodjar Language Centre</a> linguist, Sue Hanson, calls the Noongar Wikipedia \u201cinvaluable\u201d and hopes it is merely the beginning of Noongar language texts. \u201cFor a language to survive and be enjoyed you need a minimum of 200 places of use.

They will also investigate the emergence of \u201ccontemporary Noongar\u201d, which has elements of English grammar, and how this compares with traditional Noongar. </p> <p>\u201cLanguage must be dynamic to survive,\u201d Hanson says. A language is never corrupted, rather, takes on different forms to suit modern times, while always remaining valid. \u201cWe might feel sad a lot of Noongar language has died away but we can also be excited because it has developed.\u201d</p> <p>Hanson says during colonial times the Noongar people were among the most traumatised Aboriginal nations in the country. The WA Aborigines Act 1905 gave unprecedented power to a chief protector over the lives of Indigenous people, and led to the mass removal of children from many Noongar families. </p> <p>Alongside the lifetimes of sorrow this caused the community, it also meant a widespread interruption of the transmission of language between generations.</p> <p>Hanson says Western Australia has yet to constitutionally recognise the existence of its many native languages, the practical consequence of which is an absence of adequate translating or interpreting services, aside from one small service in the Kimberley region. In 2008 plans for an Aboriginal languages policy were shelved owing to the cost of implementation.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/mar/28/gina-williams-on-why-every-australian-should-know-some-indigenous-words\">Gina Williams on why every Australian should know some Indigenous words</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Language advocates in WA must instead turn to the commonwealth for support.

I checked, and England\u2019s ODI team for the Pakistan series that year did indeed include five debutants - Croft, Headley, Lloyd, Mullally and Knight. Seemed like a reasonable starting point. The only survivor of the side that toured India in 1993, three years earlier, was Alec Stewart, and given his international career spanned 14 years and 140 matches it\u2019s quite tricky to find a side without him in it. But he didn\u2019t play in the fifth ODI of that India series, Richard Blakey taking the gloves. Which means the team of August 29 1996 vs Pakistan in Manchester contained no survivors from the team of March 1st 1993 vs India at Jamshedpur. Scorecards: <a href=\"http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/64414.html\">1993</a> and <a href=\"http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/current/match/65020.html\">1996</a>. Having done all that leg work, I fully expect someone to come along and produce a side from two years ago that looks nothing like today\u2019s, but I\u2019ve established that I\u2019m a tragic cricket geek so there is that at least.\u201d</p> <p>Good work.

Eoin Morgan will be telling them otherwise, and pointing out that they are still only <a href=\"http:// http://www.icc-cricket.com/team-rankings/odi\">fifth in the world at this kind of cricket</a>. But they could be forgiven for a certain amount of ambling. And it might make for a better contest \u2013 though the game itself, with its love of a good levelling, may have something to say about that.</p> <p>Pakistan have three targets at Headingley today, apart from the obvious one of claiming a consolation victory.

These one-day players are markedly younger than the Dad\u2019s Army Misbah-ul-Haq has somehow turned into the world\u2019s top Test side, yet their fielding is even worse. If Azhar Ali can\u2019t persuade them to make routine stops, there\u2019s not much point having him in charge \u2013 especially as Sarfraz Ahmed, the Twenty20 captain, is in this team, in good form, and looking a lot more up for it than some of his team-mates. <br></p> <p>Play starts at 2pm.

America\u2019s ambitions to catch up to Russia\u2019s success with Sputnik would have to wait.</p> <p>Almost 60 years later, private spaceflight company SpaceX is feeling similarly explosive growing pains. From the same launch center at Cape Canaveral, Florida, a reusable Falcon 9 rocket <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/01/spacex-explosion-launch-site-florida\">exploded on the launch pad on Thursday morning</a> in a blast that could be felt miles away and that destroyed a satellite meant to expand internet access.</p> <p>The company\u2019s founder and CEO, tech billionaire Elon Musk, has <a href=\"https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/771394161756942336\">said</a> that the rocket exploded \u201cduring propellant fill operation\u201d and that the blast \u201coriginated around upper stage oxygen tank\u201d. </p> <p>Musk has stayed stoical about the company\u2019s accidents, and SpaceX itself only gave an engineer\u2019s euphemism for the explosion in its first statement, describing the blast as \u201can anomaly on the pad\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/jan/05/spacex-mission-reusable-rockets-elon-musk\">SpaceX mission could herald new era of reusable rockets</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The history of spaceflight is littered with explosions, accidents and disasters: SpaceX has had its share but has avoided tragedy or injury. Nasa has contracted the company to help take supplies to the International Space Station, and together the organizations hope to bring manned launches back to American launch pads in 2017. SpaceX\u2019s year of success and failure has cast that schedule into doubt.</p> <h2>The booms</h2> <p>SpaceX has had more success than failure in the 14 years since it was founded, when Musk set out with about 30 employees to revolutionize spaceflight with reusable rockets \u2013 the kind that can save small fortunes in fuel and technology with every landing. </p> <p>In December 2010, SpaceX became the first private company to send a spacecraft into low-Earth orbit and back, and a year and a half later it became <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2012/may/25/spacex-dragon-capsule-space-exploration\">the first to dock</a> at the International Space Station. That same year it first resupplied the station, and by 2014 it won a $2.6bn Nasa contract alongside Boeing to take US astronauts into space.</p> <p>On 21 December 2015, the company managed its first landing of a reusable rocket \u2013 just under a month after a rival spaceflight company, headed by Amazon billionaire Jeff Bezos, achieved a similar landing with a smaller vehicle. Then on 8 April 2016, after four failures during the past year, the company landed a reusable rocket on a drone ship floating in the Atlantic ocean, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/apr/08/spacex-rocket-test-elon-musk-international-space-station\">the first ever landing at sea</a>. </p> <p>In the next eight months the company <a href=\"http://www.space.com/33742-spacex-satellite-launch-rocket-landing.html\">repeated the feat six times</a> in all, four at sea and twice on land.

After proving the rockets could lift supplies to astronauts in orbit, SpaceX began testing their abilities to land on a robotic drone ship out at sea \u2013 unmanned for safety, and mobile to meet the rocket, if a little unsteady.

Nasa, for instance, has had contractors <a href=\"https://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/msp98/news/mco990930.html\">mix up metric measurements</a>, <a href=\"http://www.skyandtelescope.com/astronomy-news/mars-polar-lander-found-at-last/\">lost a lander somewhere on Mars</a>, and its Kepler spacecraft <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/apr/11/nasa-re-establishes-solid-contact-with-kepler-spacecraft\">jerry-rigged</a> into a planet hunter sailing on pressure from radiation off the sun. In recent years, Russia\u2019s space agency has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/may/08/russias-failed-progress-spacecraft-plunges-into-the-pacific-ocean\">lost control of a cargo ship</a>, and had <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/04/27/vladimir-putin-slams-repeated-russian-space-failures-after-delay/\">repeated malfunctions</a> and <a href=\"http://www.parabolicarc.com/2015/05/16/years-failure-haunt-russian-space-program/\">engine failures</a>.</p> <p>Like Nasa, Musk remains ambitious. Earlier this year he announced that SpaceX intends to send <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/apr/27/elon-musk-space-x-mars-mission-tesla\">an unmanned mission to Mars by 2018</a>, to investigate the demands of a later crewed mission. The company has also won a contract <a href=\"http://www.ses.com/4233325/news/2016/22407810\">to launch one of its used rockets</a> with a payload; Thursday\u2019s launch involved a new rocket.<br></p> <p>Nasa\u2019s inspector general doused cold water on some of those aspirations in <a href=\"https://oig.nasa.gov/audits/reports/FY16/IG-16-028.pdf\">an audit released Thursday</a>. The mission to take astronauts into space from US launchpads \u201ccontinues to face multiple challenges that will likely delay the first routine flight\u201d, the office said in its report. The US will continue relying on foreign agencies, such as Russia\u2019s Roscosmos, to launch astronauts \u201cuntil late 2018 \u2013 more than 3 years after NASA\u2019s original 2015 goal\u201d, the auditors added.</p>",
  "<h2>7am: take Parasolvent for a spin</h2> <p>One of the artworks that seemed to reflect this year\u2019s theme (\u201cDa Vinci\u2019s Workshop\u201d) best is Parasolvent by Dan Benedict. It consists of a disembodied suit standing at the base of a ferris wheel that has umbrellas instead of cars on its outer rim. Viewers can turn an enormous crank, which turns the wheel and makes the umbrellas flow between the suit\u2019s shoulder blades.

His role predates the tenures of president Dana White and outgoing owners Frank and Lorenzo Fertitta, who took over the UFC and made it a multi-billion dollar industry.</p> <p>A big part of the reason the UFC has been able to rise is the ability of their management to find compelling fights and package them in glossy pay-per-view productions. Since the UFC controls the fate of their fighters, they mostly dictate the bouts. The fighters generally accept the proposed fights or risk being dropped.</p> <p>The MMAjunkie story says Silva is leaving after earning a share of the UFC\u2019s sale to WME-IMG this summer. His timing might be fortuitous depending on how much interest Congress shows in trying to apply the Ali Act to mixed martial arts. Oklahoma congressman Markwayne Mullin is pushing to extend the 2000 boxing law to the UFC.&#xa0;</p> <p>Among the Ali Act\u2019s provisions are stipulations that promoters must open their books to fighters, can\u2019t enter into long-term contracts with fighters and have to use independent rankings in putting together championship bouts. Application of the law could extend more power to the fighters, but it might also hamper the UFC\u2019s ability to put together the most attractive bouts. </p>",

Since hitting an impressive 117 against Yorkshire at Headingley during the second week of the campaign, arguably the innings which sealed his berth in the Test side, he has posted a series of low scores against the red ball. This 84-ball knock with 10 boundaries was his best score in 24 innings.</p> <p>Vince has failed to score above 42 in seven Tests in the middle order against Sri Lanka and Pakistan, meaning his place in the touring squad for the early-winter series in Bangladesh is in serious doubt.</p> <p>But here he was able to contribute to an impressive Hampshire fightback from 38 for three, finding an ally in the Zimbabwe-born left-hander Ervine.</p> <p>Since the start of July Ervine has gone beyond 50 six times in eight innings, including two centuries in last week\u2019s draw against Somerset at Taunton.

They had started the day well, despite adding only six runs to their overnight score of 275 for nine. Brooks, Ryan Sidebottom and Steve Patterson all struck inside the first 15 overs of the home reply, with Will Smith and Tom Alsop falling lbw and Jimmy Adams caught at short mid-wicket off Patterson.</p> <p>But Vince and Ervine united to share a counterattacking century stand for the fourth wicket either side of lunch. Vince played confidently down the ground and through the covers before edging Tim Bresnan to second slip as the score slipped to 145 for four.</p> <p>Ervine then proceeded to add 54 for the fifth wicket with the overseas all-rounder Ryan McLaren before falling to Sidebottom, caught behind in the latter stages of the afternoon.</p> <p>That sparked the Hampshire collapse, with the effervescent Brooks prospering.

  "<p>A cross-party group of MPs are backing a new law that could force multinational corporations to disclose where they do business, the money they make and the tax they pay.</p> <p>An amendment to the finance bill, which has crossbench support, proposes that the government should agree in principle to release information currently held by HM Revenue and Customs. </p> <p>Campaigners have argued that such an amendment could ensure that multinationals, which operate across several countries, adhere to \u201cpublic country-by-country reporting\u201d. </p> <p>It follows the landmark ruling of the European commission this week to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/30/apple-pay-back-taxes-eu-ruling-ireland-state-aid\">order Apple to pay back the Irish state</a> up to \u20ac13bn (\u00a311bn) in taxes. </p> <p>A Treasury official said on Thursday that the amendment is being carefully considered. Theresa May promised to be tough on tax evasion and avoidance during her campaign to become leader of the Conservatives. </p> <p>Drawn up by the Labour MP Caroline Flint, <a href=\"http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/bills/cbill/2016-2017/0047/amend/finance_rm_0831.pdf\">the amendment</a> has gained the support of more than 60 MPs \u2013 including the shadow chancellor John McDonnell, the current and former chairs of the public accounts committee (PAC) and Conservative members of the committee. </p> <p>\u201cMPs and the public are saying it is time to shine a light on these secretive tax arrangements and make sure big multinational enterprises pay the right amount of tax,\u201d Flint said. \u201cThis public country-by-country reporting is a simple way to tackle a huge problem of avoidance.\u201d</p> <p> Other MPs supporting the amendment include members of the Scottish National party, the Ulster Unionist party, the Social Democratic and Labour party, Plaid Cymru and the Liberal Democrats. The House of Commons is expected to consider the remaining stages of the bill on Monday and Tuesday, including Flint\u2019s amendment. It has already completed the committee stage. </p> <p>Flint, a PAC member, first put forward a similar amendment to the bill in June that, if it had been accepted, would have forced multinationals to make disclosures on tax. While welcomed in principle by the then tax minister David Gauke, it was opposed by the government because, he argued, it needed to be implemented with international cooperation.</p> <p>Flint said that the new \u201cpermissive\u201d amendment would mean that the government could accept the principle of transparency but implement it at a later date. <br></p> <p>\u201cWe have changed the amendment so that it no longer binds the government to a strict timetable, but would commit ministers to the principle of transparency,\u201d she added. \u201cThe only reason they might reject this is if they really do not want it to happen.\u201d</p> <p>The amendment is supported by Meg Hillier, the chair of the PAC \u2013 which scrutinises HMRC. She said: \u201cIf the government is serious about greater tax transparency by multinationals then it should have no fear in agreeing to this amendment.\u201d <br></p> <p>The Treasury is already proposing new rules to punish offshore tax evaders who fail to come clean about their finances before September 2018, with fines of up to 200% of the amount owed.

His chances of slipping a devastating takedown of this year\u2019s Autumn Statement into casual chitchat with Tess Daly may admittedly be limited, but there\u2019s a time for hitting voters over the head with hard economic theory, and a time for simply earning the right to be heard again, building your way slowly back up to a position of trust.</p> <p>And if it all seems a bit undignified \u2013 well, as Balls found out last year, there\u2019s nothing terribly dignified about losing elections either. Few politicians have more time or reason to reflect on why their party lost an election than those who lose their own seats. Just occasionally, those personally closest to disaster can see what others miss.</p> <p>Those who really can\u2019t bear the idea of politicians lowering themselves to engage with popular culture should meanwhile perhaps reflect on the fact that Strictly reaches up to 12 million viewers, whereas Newsnight gets half a million on a good night, and save the intellectual snobbery for a time when Labour can once again afford to be picky.</p>",

Hell or High Water, he says, was a \u201clove at first sight&#xa0;experience\u201d, when he was sent Sheridan\u2019s script as a spec project: \u201cI&#xa0;very rarely read a script that I don\u2019t feel I want to change a lot.\u201d Mackenzie acknowledges that the Hollywood new wave comparisons are apt \u2013 \u201cIt had the freewheeling vibe to it that I love in 70s movies\u201d \u2013 but suggests that depression-era outlaw stories (of which the new wavers made plenty, such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/oct/17/bonnie-clyde-crime\">Bonnie and Clyde</a>, Dillinger and Thieves Like Us) was as much of an influence on Hell or High Water\u2019s social comment. \u201cIt\u2019s a reclamation of some kind against forces that are bigger than people. I&#xa0;wanted that <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Boy_Floyd\">Pretty Boy Floyd</a> atmosphere.\u201d He&#xa0;says the name given to Pine and Foster\u2019s characters \u2013 Howard \u2013 is \u201ca sly reference to Jesse James\u2019s alias\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7516599ce554425836db6802a60f468016622915\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7516599ce554425836db6802a60f468016622915/0_32_5000_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"David Mackenzie at the Cannes film festival in May this year, for the showing of Hell or High Water\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">David Mackenzie at the Cannes film festival in May this year, for the showing of Hell or High Water.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pascal Le Segretain/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>James, of course, belongs to an earlier era of American outlawry, but the point is well-made; it is the sense of economic hardship, bred in the bone for generations, that underpins the brothers\u2019 criminality, and is exactly what US audiences \u2013 in the era of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jan/24/the-big-short-review-crash-riveting-steve-carell-christian-bale\">The Big Short</a>, the Trans-Pacific Partnership and Trumponomics \u2013 wants to hear. \u201cI\u2019m an outsider; I\u2019m not involved in American politics, but these themes are there to be picked up on. I can shine a light on them, I can touch on them, but I am not in a position to ram them home. That\u2019s not my sensibility anyway.\u201d</p> <p>But exactly what is Mackenzie\u2019s sensibility? Though a staple of the festival circuit, and a pillar of the Scottish film industry, he is remarkably hard to pin down, as a director at least. Hell or High Water is Mackenzie\u2019s ninth feature, released 14 years after his first, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2003/may/09/artsfeatures6\">The Last Great Wilderness</a>. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2004/mar/26/dvdreviews.shopping\">Young Adam</a>, the Alexander Trocchi adaptation he released in 2003, remains probably his most admired film; the Jack O\u2019Connell prison flick <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/mar/23/starred-up-review-prison-drama-mark-kermode\">Starred Up</a> \u2013 until Hell or High Water came along \u2013 the closest he has come to a popular success. He has a proper body of work to his name, but if it is distinguished by anything, it is by its pinballing, switchback nature: a determined effort not to go over old ground, to the extent that the usual evidence of directorial signature is almost entirely absent.</p> <p>\u201cI think there are connections between them,\u201d Mackenzie says, frowning. \u201cBut it\u2019s true, it\u2019s quite hard to pin down what they are. I\u2019m not doing it wilfully; in the early days, I was just trying to do something original each time. Signature film-making seems rather dull to me; it\u2019s about finding something you can do something with, and running with the ball.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8ff2f3780a1f4c8528614e99c2ed8440a65b8c51\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8ff2f3780a1f4c8528614e99c2ed8440a65b8c51/0_88_3504_2102/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jack O\u2019Connell in Mackenzie\u2019s 2013 film Starred Up\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jack O\u2019Connell in Mackenzie\u2019s 2013 film Starred Up.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Film4</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Mackenzie talks about \u201ctuning into\u201d or \u201cassimilating\u201d into the world of each film \u2013 whether it is the Marfa, Texas, of Hell or High Water, or the grimy sludge of T in the Park for his guerrilla-shot music festival romance You Instead. \u201cA lot of cinema is about the game of authenticity \u2013 do you feel it\u2019s real?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAs a director, when you embrace a project, you try to understand as much as you can about its world, and you do that by embracing and engaging with people who are in that world. Then it\u2019s down to your best instincts, which is what most directing is about anyway.\u201d Describing himself as a \u201cnavy brat\u201d, he mentions an itinerant childhood as a possible source for this habit (he is the son of <a href=\"http://www.heraldscotland.com/opinion/obituaries/14177989.John_Mackenzie/\">Rear-Admiral John Mackenzie</a>, a senior officer in the Royal Navy). Directing, he says, \u201cis all about an alchemy, a dance\u201d; on set, he says, he is \u201ctrying to steer towards what\u2019s needed\u201d. \u201cIf you ever have to do any hard steering, it feels less than ideal. It\u2019s a gentle dance. I don\u2019t know if I explained that very well.\u201d</p> <p>Despite You Instead attracting some unkind reviews, Mackenzie credits the film with loosening him up as a director: choosing to shoot an entire feature in five days in \u201cthe most uncontrollable environment you could possibly make a film in\u201d was \u201can amazingly liberating experience\u201d. \u201cWe had to roll with the blows and the circumstances at any given moment. We had to evolve our technique, shooting with longer lenses so people wouldn\u2019t notice the camera.\u201d Now, he says, he doesn\u2019t \u201creally give a fuck about originality\u201d, and is less uncomfortable with genre films. It is no coincidence, surely, that his recent critical and commercial surge has been due to taking on those very genre films \u2013 Starred Up, Hell or High Water \u2013 that he spent so long avoiding.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a296da6206cee9a61e55ad79909854ed7b1f1273\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a296da6206cee9a61e55ad79909854ed7b1f1273/602_0_2491_1496/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ewan McGregor and Emily Mortimer in Young Adam, 2003\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ewan McGregor and Emily Mortimer in Young Adam, 2003.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Hanway Films</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Thinking back, he says that in the late 90s and early noughties, when he was making award-winning short films and developing his first features, his main inspiration was Danish cinema, and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/nov/25/how-dogme-built-denmark\">Dogme 95 movement</a> in particular. \u201cIt punched above its weight for a small country and made some incredible stuff. It was very hard not to admire it from the outside, and think that it was possible to do something like that in Scotland.\u201d</p> <p>It didn\u2019t work out that way, says Mackenzie, but Sigma Films, the company he founded with his production partner Gillian Berrie, has been very thick with Lars von Trier\u2019s Zentropa over the years: joint credits include <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2006/oct/27/thriller\">Red Road</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/News_Story/Critic_Review/Guardian_review/0,,1099881,00.html\">Wilbur Wants to Kill Himself</a> (from the <a href=\"https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=XUsqlE-OmOcC&amp;pg=PA46&amp;dq=%22advance+party%22+von+trier&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi12qnc0JjOAhVrCcAKHfnRAuoQ6AEIIjAB#v=onepage&amp;q=%22advance%20party%22%20von%20trier&amp;f=false\">\u201cScottish Dogme\u201d scheme Advance Party</a>) and von Trier\u2019s Dogville. Zentropa also helped Mackenzie\u2019s debut, The Last Great Wilderness, into production; it looks very Dogme-ish now, with its frenetically mobile low-tech video camera.</p> <p>His attachment to Danish cinema may also have led to his career low point; he readily admits to finding his ambitious end-of-the-world fable <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/oct/06/perfect-sense-film-review\">Perfect Sense </a>\u2013 from a script by Danish writer Kim Fupz Aakeson, and backed again by Zentropa \u2013 a difficult and, at times, disorientating experience. He says he found it \u201cemotionally hard\u201d, and that he \u201ctried really hard, but I was going home every night and asking whether we really knew what the idea was supposed to be. I\u2019ve never felt less comfortable as a director.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"702c77a6b75a94c96336226d2780a4c67a7190a2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/702c77a6b75a94c96336226d2780a4c67a7190a2/0_0_2000_1333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jeff Bridges as the lawman, with Gil Birmingham as his sidekick, in Hell or High Water.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jeff Bridges as the lawman, with Gil Birmingham as his sidekick, in Hell or High Water.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/FILM 44</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Perfect Sense does, however, fit into the narrative of reaction and about-turn that is how Mackenzie describes his film-making progress. The barebones simplicity of You Instead was, he says, a reaction to Perfect Sense\u2019s overwrought, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/sep/29/melancholia-film-review\">Melancholia</a>-style imaginings, while Perfect Sense was itself a high-minded response to his first, not entirely comfortable, American production: the Ashton Kutcher sex comedy <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/dec/31/spread-review\">Spread</a>. Released in<strong> </strong>2008, Spread is by some way Mackenzie\u2019s most unlikely film; and one that, despite its confidence and fluency, appeared to sour Mackenzie against a planned full-time shift to LA. He doesn\u2019t go into detail, but admits: \u201cThere was a little bit of negativity between myself and the producers, and it left a nasty taste in my mouth. I don\u2019t really want to go there, as it feels a long time ago and the final film is my vision \u2013 but gentlemanly behaviour wasn\u2019t going on.\u201d Instead, he went back to Glasgow and got on with Perfect Sense.</p> <p>Hell or High Water is his first venture in the US since Spread, and it seems that the credibility he derived from Starred Up put him back on the radar of US producers. Starred Up wasn\u2019t a commercial success in the US, he says, but \u2013 as he rather sheepishly points out \u2013 despite \u201cnot being particularly macho in the way I live my life, somehow or other it allowed Americans to regard me as someone able to deal with macho subjects\u201d. Having extracted what could well be a career-changing performance from Pine, Mackenzie would appear to be set fair for a proper tilt at Hollywood.</p> <p>Only then does his careful, diplomatic manner break down, after I suggest that Marvel \u2013 with its current penchant for indie directors \u2013 might be considering putting in a call. \u201cI can\u2019t fucking bear superheroes, so I won\u2019t be doing one of those.\u201d It is the nearest he gets to actual asperity; fortunately, Hollywood is a big place, and Marvel is not the only game in town. \u201cI look forward to the day when the general public get tired of these things \u2013 I\u2019ve been tired of them for a long time.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Tunisians used to say that one in five of their countrymen worked for the secret police. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leyla_Bouzid\">Leyla Bouzid</a> was an aspiring young noughties film-maker in Tunis\u2019s F\u00e9d\u00e9ration des Cin\u00e9astes Amateurs when she found out that one of her close friends in the club was an informer. It wasn\u2019t an isolated experience. Of the paranoia that runs through her galloping debut feature <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgx_48jQAmE\">As I Open My Eyes</a>, about a rock group trying to find their voice and hold their nerve in the final months of former president <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jun/20/ben-ali-sentenced-35-years-jail\">Ben Ali</a>\u2019s rule, she says plainly: \u201cThese are things either that I saw, or that friends or myself lived through.\u201d</p> <p>Bouzid left Tunisia shortly after the informer incident to study literature at the Sorbonne, but returned as soon as she could, in fiction. As I Open My Eyes pivots around an incandescent performance from Baya Medhaffar as the corkscrew-haired chanteuse Farah, foolhardy and fiery in her determination to confront the regime. People\u2019s Choice award-winner at Venice last year, it is a fine addition to a strong recent crop of feminist Middle Eastern and Maghreb cinema, including Wadjda, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/may/15/mustang-review-women-rural-turkey-oscar-nominated\">Mustang</a>, the Moroccan prostitution drama <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/nov/10/much-loved-review-sex-trade-morocco-nabil-ayouch-loubna-abidar\">Much Loved, </a>and the Pakistani thriller <a href=\"http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x21nel2_dukhtar-pakistani-movie-official-trailer-2014_shortfilms\">Dukhtar</a>. But for Bouzid, the film\u2019s importance is precisely Tunisian; its mission to return to 2010 and the stirrings of what became the Arab spring. \u201cIt was very important for me to go back,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s true there was this revolution, and the world went: \u2018Wow!\u2019 But we didn\u2019t go deeply into things at all.

Farah\u2019s mother, who tries to protect her by insisting she stop her rebellion, is her most visible enemy for most of the film. Ben Ali may be long gone, but such problems have not vanished: Bouzid cites <a href=\"http://www.middleeasteye.net/news/drugs-charges-dropped-against-prominent-tunisian-blogger-996563949\">the 2014 arrest </a>of blogger Azyz Amami under <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2016/02/02/tunisia-widespread-abuses-under-drug-law\">law 52</a>, an anti-drug measure still used by the Tunisian state to clamp down on youth expression. She is in no doubt that there is major work to be done if the country is to move forward. \u201cI believe in the necessity of a cultural revolution in our country. Not just political revolution, but creating new forms of thought.\u201d</p> <p>Holding court the morning after her film has screened at Cinemed festival in Montpellier, the 32-year-old is getting into her stride. \u201cOur young musicians and artists don\u2019t have a voice in Europe today.

  "<p>I am writing in response to a series of articles asserting that the Syrian government \u201ccontrols UN aid\u201d and that the UN has channelled funding intended for life-saving humanitarian response to the \u201cAssad regime\u201d (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/29/how-assad-regime-controls-un-aid-intended-for-syrias-children\" title=\"\">Reports</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/29/un-pays-tens-of-millions-to-assad-regime-syria-aid-programme-contracts\" title=\"\">30</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/30/un-under-pressure-to-set-up-inquiry-into-syria-aid-programme\" title=\"\">31</a> August). The UN welcomes public scrutiny of its humanitarian operations in Syria. Our programmes, partners, contracting and financial details are published online, available to the media and public alike. However, your articles mischaracterise the UN-led humanitarian operation in Syria, fail to offer a balanced perspective on the challenges of operating in Syria and discredit the courageous work of national and international humanitarian aid workers who risk their lives on a daily basis to help millions of people in need in one of the world\u2019s most vicious conflicts.</p> <p>Impartiality in humanitarian terms means that we provide life-saving and life-sustaining assistance to civilians based on their humanitarian needs without consideration of where they are, which side in the conflict they may sympathise with, their nationality, social status, gender, age, religious belief or any other consideration. This fundamental notion of impartiality guides our work and is non-negotiable, in Syria or anywhere else.</p> <p>Inside Syria, as in other countries, UN agencies must work with key government departments to support the delivery of public services and humanitarian relief. Some governments, such as the one in Syria, insist that UN agencies work with a list of authorised implementing partners. However, we choose our partners from that list based on our own assessments of their capacity to deliver and following due diligence processes \u2013 not because we are forced to work with any particular organisation in order to stay and deliver in the country. In areas not controlled by the government, we work with local partners that may not be authorised by the government.</p> <p>As political solutions remain elusive, humanitarian needs grow exponentially. The UN is doing everything we can to reach all 13.5 million people in need of urgent humanitarian assistance. Our humanitarian imperative compels us to pursue every means of delivery, and though far from enough, we are saving lives every day in Syria. In 2016, the UN and its partners have provided food to 5.7 million people a month. We have delivered over 7m medical treatments to the most vulnerable. Our relief convoys have crossed active frontlines and our aircraft have air-dropped aid to reach over 1.2 million civilians, many more than once, in besieged, hard-to-reach and other priority locations in which people desperately need our help.</p> <p>Cross-border operations are a vital part of the response to deliver assistance by crossing international borders into Syria, predominantly to areas not under government control. When we deliver to these areas crossing borders, we notify, but do not seek explicit approval from, the Syrian government. Since the security council authorised this in July 2014, we have sent nearly 10,000 trucks loaded with life-saving UN aid across the authorised borders from Turkey and Jordan.</p> <p>The conflict in Syria is the greatest humanitarian crisis of our time. Civilians across Syria are in desperate need and are crying out for our help. We cannot deprive people of aid because there is pressure to disengage from a party to the conflict. The impartiality of the UN\u2019s humanitarian operations is fundamental to saving lives and our focus is squarely on reaching people in need. To achieve this, we must work with all to reach all.<br><strong>Stephen O\u2019Brien</strong><br><em>UN under-secretary-general for humanitarian affairs and emergency relief coordinator</em></p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Join the debate \u2013 email </em></strong><a href=\"mailto:guardian.letters@theguardian.com\" title=\"\"><strong><em>guardian.letters@theguardian.com</em></strong></a></p>",

Schubert is obviously the starting point, but, stylistically, the 20 songs span the whole of the 19th and early 20th centuries, colonising the atonal territory of the Second Viennese School as comfortably as they evoke the folk-song settings of an earlier generation.</p> <p>Boesch and Vignoles evoke this kaleidoscope of styles with fabulous naturalness and fierce dramatic intensity when needed. They give equally idiomatic performances of the group of four songs by Zemlinsky that are included as a fill-up.

Of 184 Georgians shot and killed by police officers since 2010 \u2013 nearly half of whom were unarmed or shot in the back \u2013 none of the officers involved were indicted, according to <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://investigations.myajc.com/overtheline/ga-police-shootings/\">an Atlanta Journal-Constitution investigation last year</a>.</p> <p>The new law curtailing these privileges took effect on 1 July this year, but because Rogers was killed prior to that it did not affect this hearing. </p> <p>In the hours before the indictment was announced, roughly 200 people gathered for a vigil that lasted 24 hours before and during James Burns\u2019 hearing. Supporters stayed outside the Fulton County courthouse overnight, and held signs listing the names of people killed at the hands of cops. The list included Jamarion Robinson, a 26-year-old shot and killed by US marshals last month while being served arrest warrants.</p> <p>\u201cWe know that we\u2019ve got to continue fighting to make sure that he is sent to jail,\u201d said Dre Norman, who stayed outside the courthouse overnight, referring to Burns.</p> <p>Burns was charged with two violations of oath of office, aggravated assault, felony murder, and making a false statement.</p> <p>Shean Williams, a partner at the Cochran Law Firm, placed blame on the police department for failing \u201cto provide adequate training and discipline to officer Burns\u201d such that it is \u201cultimately responsible for the death of Caine Rogers through the actions of officer Burns\u201d.</p> <p>After Rogers\u2019 death, Xochitl Bervera, director of the Racial Justice Action Center, called on Atlanta police chief George Turner to take responsibility for his department\u2019s role in the incident. </p> <p>\u201cChief Turner needs to acknowledge that killings happen when officers are trained to see community members as enemies and neighborhoods as combat zones to occupy,\u201d she said. \u201cUntil we get rid of broken window policing and policing for profit, we will continue to see officers violating the rights of \u2013 and sometimes ending the lives of \u2013 our friends, neighbors and fellow residents.\u201d</p> <p>When asked about changes to training protocol since Rogers death, Atlanta police spokesperson Sgt Warren Pickard answered:</p> <p>\u201cThe actions that Burns took in this incident were the result of his decision-making, not as a result of training.\u201d</p>",

In fact, Heidi\u2019s request to end things on the basis that he was \u201cneedy\u201d was entirely unfathomable to him. \u201cIt is weird, isn\u2019t it?\u2019 he wondered rhetorically of the Daily Mail at the time. \u201cI find it all weird. I mean, she came up to the flat in London last week to change my sheets. I honestly can\u2019t get to the bottom of it.\u201d</p> <p>Amazing.</p> <p>Anyway, back to the present day. It is little known that every morning for some years, Gregg would stare into his enchanted mirror and inquire: \u201cMirror mirror on the wall, who\u2019s the most cooking judge of all?\u201d And every morning the mirror would beam his own visage back at him and reply, \u201cYOU ARE, GREGG.\u201d Gregg Wallace has long known that he bestrides the world of giving points to food like a Colossus. He looms over a plate like he\u2019s invading its personal space, and the public love him for it. He strongly suspects his iconic catchphrase \u2013 \u201cCooking doesn\u2019t get tougher than this\u201d \u2013 will soon be given listed status.</p> <p>One day last week, however, this morning ritual was cataclysmically disrupted, and it was not Gregg\u2019s face that he saw in the looking glass. But who is this? Who is this lady biting into a sachertorte with a critical tooth, before pronouncing it \u201creally very accomplished\u201d? Over to the mirror, which doesn\u2019t mince its words: \u201cMARY BERRY IS THE MOST COOKING JUDGE!\u201d it informs him. \u201cMASTERCHEF HAS BECOME A SECOND-TIER COOKING SHOW.\u201d</p> <p>Once he\u2019s stopped screaming, and swept up the mirror shards and spittle, Gregg has two options. A poisoned apple tart with a brulee glaze. Or an outing in the Sun on Sunday, in which he goes to war with Mary over some passing comment she\u2019s made about deep-fat fryers. He chooses the latter. Indeed, he chooses batter.</p> <p>But first, a recap of Mary\u2019s comment \u2013 made to Good Housekeeping \u2013 in which the Great British Bake Off star poured scorn on the smell and health risks of fryers, declaring: \u201cI don\u2019t think&#xa0;any household should have one.\u201d Dear Mary! I suspect she is one of those&#xa0;national treasures whose results on the <a href=\"https://www.politicalcompass.org/\" title=\"\">Political Compass</a> test I\u2019d be much happier not knowing. A bit like Joanna Lumley.</p> <p>For Gregg, however, this was nothing less than a culinary invasion of Poland. As he <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/1681032/telly-chef-gregg-wallace-goes-to-war-with-bake-off-star-mary-berry-over-fried-food/\" title=\"\">thundered in the Sun</a>: \u201cEvery household down my road in Peckham, south-east London, stunk of deep-fat frying and I\u2019m sure every working-class home around the country was the same. How would you have done chips and Spam fritters without a deep-fat fryer? It really does beggar belief. Our nation was built on chips and Spam fritters.\u201d</p> <p>Mirror, mirror on the wall \u2026 But there was more. Much more. \u201cThe smell of deep-fat frying was universal back then, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d inquired Gregg, again rhetorically. \u201cIt brought families and friends together. To suggest getting rid of it isn\u2019t just an assault on the deep-fat fryer but on the traditional British psyche. I love Mary dearly but this is an attack on our British way of life.\u201d</p> <p>If those sound to you like the words of someone who\u2019ll say anything, and with any amount of confected feeling, just to get Bake Off out of the headlines, then you have simply failed to understand the centrality of the fryer to this island race. It is existential. Happily Gregg, now on his fourth marriage \u2013 they met after <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-3728242/MasterChef-s-Gregg-Wallace-arriving-Hever-Castle-ahead-marrying-Anne-Marie-Sterpini-celebrity-friends.html\" title=\"\">she asked him a question about rhubarb</a> on Twitter \u2013 understands all about gathering round the fryer like the Waltons. Not that he didn\u2019t write the book on moderation too. \u201cI\u2019ve lost three stone in the past couple of years,\u201d he finds space to point out, \u201cso I know about it.\u201d</p> <p>Lest the sledgehammer nature of his shade-throwing be missed, though, Gregg ends with a reminder that certain glass-house dwellers are no better than they should be. \u201cThe main thing to remember,\u201d he points out, \u201cis that things like deep-fat-fried foods, or the delicious sugary buttery cakes like Mary Berry bakes, are treats.\u201d</p> <p>As are you, Gregg. As are you. Indeed, we look forward to hearing much more from you at your very earliest convenience, and as frequently as possible while this record-breaking series of Bake Off continues.</p>",

  "<p>Joe Markko was 14 years old when he first encountered Larry Hill hobbling around the north side of Chicago on a pair of white wooden crutches, rapping about God and salvation in a way that captivated him. It was October 1962, and the 26-year-old Hill was a pentecostal minister who specialised in saving \u201cstreet people\u201d \u2013 drug addicts, motorcycle gang members, even delinquents such as Markko, who had spent much of his youth shuttled between foster homes and juvenile correctional facilities.</p> <p>More than 50 years later, Markko still recalls the meeting: \u201cLarry had, and still does have, an incredibly commanding presence,\u201d he says. \u201cThat was always one of the things that made him appealing to radical people. We were looking for truth, and he presented a truth. When I first met him, I thought to myself: \u2018This guy is right-on.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Markko was not converted that day, but Hill would become a friend and mentor to him, and six years later, with Chicago in tumult during the build-up to the 1968 Democratic convention and Markko\u2019s young wife fearful for their family\u2019s safety, it was to Hill\u2019s newly established church in Harpersfield, Ohio \u2013 later renamed the Church of the Risen Christ (CRC) \u2013 that they fled. Once there, Markko began sitting in on Hill\u2019s weekly radio broadcasts, accompanying the pastor\u2019s sermons on acoustic guitar. Later, his younger brother Randy joined in on bass, and the trio began performing their own Christian-themed folk songs under the name Preacher &amp; the Witness. It was not until Glenn Schwartz came into their service in early 1970, however, that Hill\u2019s church begat its own inhouse group: <a href=\"http://www.allsavedfreakband.com/home.htm\">the All Saved Freak Band</a>.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Glenn is probably the biggest electric guitar influence on my life but he could be aggressive with his religion</p> <footer> <cite>Dan Auerbach, Black Keys</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>First with <a href=\"http://www.classicbands.com/jamesgang.html\">the James Gang</a> and then with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Gas_%26_Electric_(band)\">Pacific Gas &amp; Electric</a>, Schwartz had been hailed as one of the most gifted blues guitarists of his generation, nicknamed \u201cthe white Hendrix\u201d for his skill and showmanship. \u201cWhen you see Glenn play, you see the history of rock\u2019n\u2019roll in front of your eyes,\u201d says <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/black-keys\">Black Keys</a> singer-guitarist Dan Auerbach, a fellow Ohioan who has been watching Schwartz since he was 15, at the small Cleveland bar where he still has a monthly residency. \u201cHe\u2019s probably the biggest electric guitar influence on my life, but he\u2019s always had certain barriers to success, like how aggressive he could be with his religion. He would stop songs in really abrupt places and start preaching, yelling at people, telling women they should be veiled from head to toe. He\u2019s completely uncompromising, and it\u2019s hard for the average person to deal with seeing that kind of fire in someone.\u201d<br></p> <p>Schwartz once counted Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin and Frank Zappa among his many admirers, but he was not cut out for fame and in June 1968, at his lowest ebb \u201cof drug addiction, of stealing cars, of lying and cheating\u201d, he turned instead to Christianity. Eighteen months later, his religious beliefs had so alienated him from his bandmates that he quit Pacific Gas &amp; Electric and returned home to Cleveland, \u201cwhere I started backsliding, like a dog returning to his own vomit. I had no direction, no church to go to, no one to guide or rebuke me. That\u2019s when I met the pastor. That\u2019s when I got involved in the cult.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"53b25415d96214e6754284f086352cdd9ceab190\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/53b25415d96214e6754284f086352cdd9ceab190/0_0_1094_1166/938.jpg\" alt=\"Glenn Schwartz All Saved Freak Band\" width=\"938\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Freak power \u2026 guitarist Glenn Schwartz.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ramona Shay</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Hill heard about the local hero who had forsaken a promising rock\u2019n\u2019roll career to commit himself to Christ, and immediately recognised what Schwartz\u2019s name and talent could do for his own musical ambitions. \u201cHe drove through a snowstorm to see me play in Boston one night, then he took me to a restaurant and we talked for five hours,\u201d Schwartz remembers. \u201cHis message was powerful. He preached real hard, real heavy \u2013 fire and brimstone stuff. That sounded pretty good to me, so I decided to go back with him.\u201d</p> <p>Schwartz\u2019s arrival brought increased profile and professionalism to the band, but it was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/may/06/ohio-neil-young-kent-state-shootings\">the killing of four anti-war demonstrators by the Ohio National Guard on 4 May 1970</a> \u2013 at nearby Kent State university \u2013 that gave them purpose. The All Saved Freak Band became a constant presence in Kent, hosting weekly services at a bar on Water Street, which usually ended with members of the audience coming forward to be saved. Some of those people even joined the band, such as guitarist Mike Berkey, classically trained sisters Pam and Kim Massman and percussionist Tom Miller, who was also a member of the famed Kent 25, a group of demonstrators indicted on a series of charges connected to the events of that day.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify%3Aalbum%3A1zesMRzw7cKiPaDrpHQytq\"> <iframe width=\"300\" height=\"380\" src=\"https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify:album:1zesMRzw7cKiPaDrpHQytq\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <p>All of them went to live on \u201cthe farm\u201d, a rundown estate Hill had bought just outside the village of Orwell, on Fortney Road, where up to 25 CRC members lived full-time. Fortney Road became Hill\u2019s personal fiefdom, but for everyone else it was a hardscrabble existence of 4am rises, backbreaking manual labour and mandatory prayer meetings that went on into the small hours of the morning, all gladly endured in the belief that they were doing the Lord\u2019s work. Hard as life could be on the farm, those early days were among the happiest in the All Saved Freak Band\u2019s history: as the church\u2019s primary outreach tool, the 12-piece ensemble were frequently on the road, travelling across the US to spread the word in any venue that would have them.</p> <p>In 1973, they released their debut album, <a href=\"http://www.allsavedfreakband.com/music%20reviews.htm#For_Christians,_Elves_and_Lovers\">My Poor Generation</a>, with Nashville-based producer Rob Galbraith offering his services for free. Recorded in less than a week and sold at gigs or through mail-order on their own label, it was not as technically accomplished as later efforts (the album was made without a drummer), but its eclectic mix of swamp blues, chamber-folk and psychedelic rock received national airplay, winning offers of record deals from RCA and Columbia; offers turned down by Hill, much to the band\u2019s disappointment.</p> <p>While the album was possessed of an innocence and idealism that had been snuffed out of secular rock music a few years before, it was also massively informed by tragedy, specifically, the pair of automobile accidents that had recently claimed the lives of three members. The first was Brett Hill, Larry\u2019s son and the band\u2019s percussionist, who was killed while he and Tom Miller drove back from Kent State on 31 December 1972. Miller fell asleep at the wheel and ploughed his pickup truck into a cornfield. He survived, but Hill was sent tumbling from the passenger door, where his skull was crushed under the back wheel. A few months later, on their way to a rock festival in Illinois, Miller and Randy Markko \u2013 Joe\u2019s brother \u2013 met a similar fate when their driver dozed off and crashed on the interstate. The car burst into flames with Miller and Markko still trapped inside.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Every night we\u2019d have prayer meetings until 1am, then we\u2019d be up at 4am to feed the animals or hitch-hike to work</p> <footer> <cite>Glenn Schwartz</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cTheir deaths were devastating for us,\u201d Schwartz says. He notes that members of the church were often exhausted: \u201cEvery night we\u2019d have these prayer meetings that went on until 1am, and then we\u2019d be up at 4am to feed the animals, do the chores or hitch-hike to work through blizzards. Sometimes we only had rice to eat for months on end. It was a struggle.\u201d</p> <p>Hill held up the three people who had died as near-martyrs. \u201cThose who died were cited as examples of what real believers did, and nobody should ever complain about making any sacrifice that was less than theirs,\u201d Markko says. \u201cWhenever people died, Larry used that to become even more of \u2026 whatever he was becoming.\u201d </p> <p>What Hill was becoming was something more than their pastor: he was assuming the role of a prophet. For years, he had claimed to receive cryptic visions from God, but only recently had he been able to decipher their true meaning. He taught that America had grown spiritually corrupt and its judgment would take the form of a communist coalition of Russian, Chinese and Cuban forces, whose victory would begin the earthly rule of the Antichrist. At this time, it would fall to a group of scattered prophets \u2013 of which Hill, naturally, was one \u2013 to lead the \u201clasting generation\u201d of Christians through a long and bloody guerrilla war, restoring America to the godliness it had strayed from and paving the way for Christ\u2019s second coming. \u201cDid he believe it?\u201d Markko sighs. \u201cDoes a sociopath believe the stories they tell people? I think he wanted to.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"39c211fcff601f911874eb80e7b49e5c90756b4d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/39c211fcff601f911874eb80e7b49e5c90756b4d/584_0_1638_983/1000.jpg\" alt=\"All Saved Freak Band\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Strings attached \u2026 members of the All Saved Freak Band on stage in Vermont in 1976.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>By Markko\u2019s account, however, the rest of the group had no problem believing it. Each member was assigned entire books from the Bible to memorise, in preparation for when the communists would start burning physical copies. They underwent rigorous calisthenics and martial arts training, learned survival techniques and even dug a network of tunnels designed to hide men and supplies. Hill began stockpiling rifles, never went anywhere without a loaded .357 Magnum, and often instructed the Massman sisters \u2013 by now his most devoted acolytes \u2013 to hide a small arsenal in the band\u2019s instrument cases when they were on the road. This end-time paranoia would creep into the band\u2019s music in fascinating ways, such as Markko\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEzzOlLklDQ\">Don\u2019t Look Back</a>, which told the story of his 1968 flight from Chicago in apocalyptic terms (\u201cIf Sodom and Gomorrah came down in dust, so the cities of America surely must\u201d) and seemed to liken Hill to God himself.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jun/02/christian-rock-singer-trey-pearson-comes-out-gay\">Christian rock singer Trey Pearson comes out: 'I never wanted to be gay'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Yet even as the CRC was becoming an army of God, its casualties remained victims of misfortune. Disaster struck again in May 1973, when Markko was working in a construction job near Lake Erie and the loading boom he was operating snapped an overhead power cable, sending 27,000 volts of electricity surging through him. He suffered third-degree burns all over his body, but particularly on his hands, which he would never be able to use again. Then there was the matter of a dinner plate-sized hole in his chest through which his heart could be seen, still somehow beating. Doctors gave him just four days to live.</p> <p>But he survived and left hospital, nine months and countless agonising skin grafts later, his physical recovery so complete that even the doctors called it miraculous. But while he could no longer play an instrument, his determination to keep writing and performing music became a source of comfort during his long battles with depression. \u201cThere was a lot of struggle, but if music is part of you, it\u2019s part of you. If it\u2019s in your DNA, you have to stay involved with it. It\u2019s gotta come out somehow.\u201d</p> <p>By 1976, when the All Saved Freak Band released two albums \u2013 For Christians Elves and Lovers and Brainwashed \u2013 within a few months of each other, music was coming out at a prolific rate. Elves\u2019s unusual title and softer, folkier style was inspired by Hill\u2019s love of Tolkien \u2013 that\u2019s him dressed as Gandalf on the cover \u2013 and highlighted the growing role of the Massmans, whose vocal harmonies, pastoral songwriting and musical knowledge had become key features of the band\u2019s sound. Brainwashed, meanwhile, found the band \u2013 and Schwartz, in particular \u2013 firing angrily on all cylinders. For Schwartz, the album was uniquely personal \u2013 the title, and several songs, relate to the bizarre affair of his kidnapping by Ted Patrick, \u201cthe father of deprogramming\u201d, who had been hired by the guitarist\u2019s family to break the CRC\u2019s hold over him. Patrick had returned scores of cultists to their previous lives, but he couldn\u2019t do anything with Schwartz, and the album, recorded after his return, was both a testament to Schwartz\u2019s spiritual fortitude and a riposte to the CRC\u2019s growing list of detractors.</p> <p>\u201cWe couldn\u2019t see ourselves as a cult, and we felt very badly about being called one, but that\u2019s really what it was,\u201d Markko says. \u201cOur group began as something strong and positive, but it ended up being severely broken. When it first dawns on you that you\u2019ve been sucked in \u2013 that\u2019s a telling moment.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"4fe256a450e98fe7f104db59266a5ebf3a5a23ef\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4fe256a450e98fe7f104db59266a5ebf3a5a23ef/2_0_1020_1020/1000.jpg\" alt=\"All Saved Freak Band For Christians Elves and Lovers.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The cover of For Christians Elves and Lovers.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: The All Saved Freak Band</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The revelation finally came in February 1977, when Hill\u2019s wife and \u201cprophetess\u201d, Diane Sullivan, was witnessed brutally disciplining the 11-year-old daughter of another church member with a horsewhip. Hill was then said to have taken the whip himself in order to demonstrate how to \u201creally break [the girl\u2019s] spirit\u201d. According to many former residents, corporal punishment was commonplace at Fortney Road, with whippings and beatings administered for offences as minor as sleeping late or wearing dirty socks, but the savagery of this incident was different, provoking a spate of departures from the farm and, eventually, the attentions of the law.</p> <p>In September 1978, Sullivan was convicted on a misdemeanour child abuse violation in Ashtabula County juvenile court. She was given a six-month suspended sentence, serving only six days, and a suspended fine of $500. In court, one CRC member testified that Sullivan whipped the child \u201cas hard as she could and the clothes were ripping off the kid \u2013 and there was blood\u201d. The same witness testified that the child had been given to Sullivan by her parents at the express command of Hill.</p> <p>Hill was sought by the police, but had left the state and was never prosecuted for any crime. However, in the wake of Sullivan\u2019s conviction, members of the church began talking to the local papers about life on Fortney Road, and the prevalence of physical punishment was a recurring theme in their memories. Hill himself previously appears to have suggested severe corporal punishment should not be viewed as a major problem. In the book <a href=\"http://www.freethoughthouse.com/fortney-road.html\">Fortney Road: Life, Death, and Deception in a Christian Cult</a>, author Jeff C Stevenson quotes an article Hill wrote in the church\u2019s self-published magazine, the Freedom Bell: \u201cWe\u2019re so squeamish about bruises on our children\u2019s legs, but we can stand and watch their souls and emotions be mutilated.\u201d</p> <p>When the Guardian contacted Hill for comment, he said only that \u201cI don\u2019t care to contribute to their [his former bandmates\u2019] mess,\u201d before hanging up. Some years ago, however, he issued a statement insisting that the CRC \u201cwas no more a cult than the Baptist church is, and there was no physical abuse. The penalty for bad behaviour was usually 10 push-ups. Any accusations of abuse are from a few disgruntled members made angry by the fact that developing spirituality meant losing money \u2026 Diane Sullivan never hurt anyone and children fought to be with her. It was not a cult. We were helping kids come off drugs.\u201d</p> <p>Shortly after the court case, a disgusted and disillusioned Markko left the CRC for good. Schwartz followed a year later. \u201cOne day, the pastor was about to give me another beating with the horsewhip when I told him: \u2018I\u2019m not taking it from you no more, I\u2019m done.\u2019 He punched me in the face three times, then sat me down and said: \u2018I guess if you want to go, you can go.\u2019\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7a09N5krIyq-lqgghL7GCta8ZRnlAz4c\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/videoseries?wmode=opaque&list=PL7a09N5krIyq-lqgghL7GCta8ZRnlAz4c\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Listen to the All Saved Freak Band on YouTube.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>In his exile, Hill would cobble together one final All Saved Freak Band album \u2013 the fiercely prophetic Sower, released in 1980 and comprised of outtakes from earlier recording sessions \u2013 but the band was finished, and the Fortney Road residents began to scatter and drift apart. It wasn\u2019t until the late 90s, when Markko discovered their LPs selling for hundreds of dollars online, that he realised not only had the the band\u2019s weird history been remembered, but they were acclaimed as Christian rock pioneers. In 2006, after reuniting with his former bandmates to win legal control of the music back from Hill, they issued a best-of compilation, <a href=\"http://www.allsavedfreakband.com/how.htm\">Harps on Willows</a>, which remains their only commercially available release.</p> <p>Since returning to Ohio, Hill, now 80, has lived a reclusive life alongside Sullivan, the Massmans and Joe\u2019s sister Laura \u2013 the last of the faithful. Markko hasn\u2019t spoken with his sister since leaving the CRC, \u201cbut I have run into Larry at the funerals of mutual acquaintances. One time, I walked right up to him and said, cheerily as I could: \u2018Hey Larry, how ya doin\u2019?\u2019 He couldn\u2019t handle that, and walked out. Afterwards, everybody wanted to sit with the guy who got Larry Hill to leave.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"97432bc764920f73b8bcbbce6d65d3476f72baee\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/97432bc764920f73b8bcbbce6d65d3476f72baee/0_0_500_425/500.jpg\" alt=\"All Saved Freak Band\" width=\"500\" height=\"425\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Born again \u2026 an AFSB reunion in 2007, including (top left) Joe Markko.

Markko\u2019s new band, <a href=\"https://homebeforemidnight.com\">Home Before Midnight</a>, released their debut album earlier this year, while Schwartz recently cut an LP with Dan Auerbach and <a href=\"http://www.joewalsh.com\">Joe Walsh</a> \u2013 his onetime replacement in the James Gang \u2013 and appeared with them at this year\u2019s Coachella, guesting on the old All Saved tune Water Street, which Rolling Stone called \u201cthe best guitar jam of the festival\u201d. For both men, the music of the All Saved Freak Band remains a source of pride, even if the story is painful to revisit.</p> <p>Rob Galbraith, who produced all four albums and knew the band as well as any \u201coutsider\u201d ever did, offers a thoughtful take on their chequered legacy. \u201cGod works in mysterious ways,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m sure there are a lot of people who were ministered to by that music, who related to it and were moved by it, but had no idea how wrong an individual the catalyst for it was. I think God was able to use what the All Saved Freak Band did in spite of Larry Hill.\u201d</p> <p>That\u2019s how Markko would like to see it, too. He believes the band have been \u201creclaimed\u201d from the long shadow cast by their former pastor. \u201cI\u2019m learning to find joy in the fact that people remember the music,\u201d he says. \u201cThis was my life, and I\u2019m grateful for it. I don\u2019t regret anything. I was deceived, but I did what I did because I thought it was what God wanted from me. It\u2019s all been part of my experience. In life, you just have to learn to spit out the bones.\u201d</p>",

But in the wider culture, the spectre of atheism has been haunting us since the internet showed the wider world to the backwoods and the boondocks. And even more so since the publication about a decade ago of a trio of tracts on non-belief \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2005/feb/06/society\">The End of Faith</a>, Sam Harris, 2004; The God Delusion, Richard Dawkins, 2006; and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/jun/03/society\">God is Not Great, </a>Christopher Hitchens, 2007, all of which drew massive audiences on promo-tours and ignited widespread debate \u2013 and the release of Bill Maher\u2019s anti-religious comedy-doc <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/apr/02/religulous-film-review\">Religulous</a>.</p> <p>At the same time, religious adherence has plummeted, especially among the young and millennials, only 48% of whom, according to a survey by the Banda Group last year, are inclined to believe in any god at all. The 2008 American Religious Identification Survey found that 15% of Americans had \u201cno religious belief\u201d, which isn\u2019t quite militant atheism, but almost double what it was \u2013 8% \u2013 in 1990. The figures suggested not that atheism was growing exponentially, but that people felt less community peer-pressure, and were emboldened to admit they had no god. Atheism was on the map and up for discussion in a way it had never been before in the US \u2013 and now comes the belated cultural trickle-down.</p> <p>In Sausage Party, the denizens of a giant supermarket long for the day when they will be purchased by \u201cthe gods\u201d \u2013 customers \u2013 and taken out into \u201cthe Great Beyond\u201d to begin a wonderful life that none of them knows anything about. The movie opens with a musical number extolling the virtues of the purchasing gods and the glorious life after check-out (which suddenly sounds terribly ominous). One day a pot of Honey-Mustard (Danny McBride) is returned to the store with a terrible tale to impart: there is no Great Beyond. Instead, all the products in the store are doomed to be eaten, after every imaginable kind of sadistic \u201cpreparation\u201d \u2013 skinned alive, sliced and diced, boiled, baked or simply flung down the gullet of some sharp-toothed human. The gods are evil and monstrous, and must be stopped, he says, to widespread scepticism.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"be3feb92b3256f3b3081db2c766ca42f00847fb1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/be3feb92b3256f3b3081db2c766ca42f00847fb1/0_216_4096_2458/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ricky Gervais in The Invention of Lying.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ricky Gervais in The Invention of Lying.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Photo Credit: Sam Urdank/PR company handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When Frank the hotdog prowls the closed store at night for answers, he bumps into the Imperishables \u2013 a bottle of Firewater and a Twinkie \u2013 a kind of unofficial clergy of the foodstuffs. Firewater (Bill Hader) admits \u2013 spoiler alert \u2013 that the whole framework of gods and great outdoors was something he made up to ameliorate the despair that would assail the products if given full knowledge of their coming fate. Their religion has been a lie all along \u2013 a consoling, comforting lie, to be sure, but a lie nonetheless. It\u2019s as if they\u2019re in the Matrix. Or are like Aztecs, groomed unknowingly for human sacrifice \u2013 at the moment they find out what horror awaits them at the top of those steep stone stairs.</p> <p>Here, there are comparisons with Ricky Gervais\u2019s less successful <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/oct/02/the-invention-of-lying-review\">The Invention of Lying</a> (2009), in which Gervais tells one lie, the first ever told in his society\u2019s history, to comfort a woman whose mother is dying, and to his own great dismay accidentally invents God. And also with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/feb/13/paul-review-simon-pegg-nick-frost\">Paul</a> (2011), which Rogen stars in but didn\u2019t write, in which his alien character is able to transmit the entirety of human knowledge into another\u2019s mind with the merest prod of his ET-ish index finger. After that, religion is just not an option. Kristen Wiig plays a one-eyed backwoods evangelical true believer, and her loss of faith \u2013 and acquisition of full-sightedness \u2013 on finger-contact is instant and total.

Every day, another homophobic preacher is found diddling boys (see also: Catholicism), basking in motel sleaze with hookers and meth, or abusing little girls. When they appear on cable news, the religious right talks only of hell, never of heaven, and preaches a religion full of hatred and bigotry. It cries the blues about how bone-deep prejudice is among godless liberals against people of faith. It\u2019s nonsense, of course, with a huge side-order of projection, but the net effect is to make us ask why anyone would want to affirm a religion of such negativity and loathing. The atheism figures cited above start to become clearer.</p> <p>And what of Hollywood itself? Religion made the studios a tonne of money for most of the 20th century, with things easing up a bit after the tumult of the iconoclastic 1960s. It also made a good cover story when the studios instituted the <a href=\"http://www.screenonline.org.uk/film/id/592022/\">Hays Code</a>. In one of the odder religious moments in movie history, the nervous, half-assimilated immigrant Jews who built the studios handed over the moral invigilation of their product to Catholics \u2013 Joseph Breen, et al, at the Hays Code Office \u2013 before releasing them to an overwhelmingly Protestant audience. The Hays Code retarded the development of American movies for 40 years, but in the meantime, the age of the religious epic got under way: Quo Vadis, Ben-Hur, King of Kings, The Greatest Story Ever Told, some of the most expensive and (mostly) successful movies ever made. The Catholic audience was also vast enough to support a whole subculture of vaguely religious movies: ones in which Loretta Young or Ingrid Bergman played nuns, or Bing Crosby and Pat O\u2019Brien played lovable Irish priests \u2013 a genre that seems entirely foreign now, after Vatican II, the abortion wars, clerical child abuse and everything else.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bec9e70f67b3742b84e63617619023d0dc6541e7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bec9e70f67b3742b84e63617619023d0dc6541e7/0_0_2406_1875/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Greatest Story Ever Told, 1965.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"779\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Greatest Story Ever Told, 1965.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Cinetext/UNITED ARTISTS</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Religious adherence has been on the wane for a century in the west, but the process has been slower in the US, despite upticks such as the born again movement of the 60s and 70s, which is now slowly playing itself out after pushing its luck too far for too long. Hollywood does occasionally reach out to this demographic \u2013 most recently with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/mar/18/miracles-from-heaven-review-jennifer-garner\">Miracles from Heaven</a>, for instance \u2013 but that market isn\u2019t going to grow any larger, while the atheist demographic has increased hugely in a single decade.

That movie ends with the breaking of the Seventh Seal and all the appurtenances of Armageddon and Apocalypse \u2013 with the Book of Revelation as handy guidebook to the Last Days.

If you can ascend into heaven thanks to being good-hearted, and the saints in heaven will magic up a Backstreet Boys reunion for you on arrival, does that actually make your movie religious?</p> <p>Not at all.

Groups of schools will share ideas and resources, and therefore improve standards. According to former education secretary Nicky Morgan, Mats are the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/the-importance-of-partnerships-for-a-world-class-education-system\">most efficient way</a>\u201d to spread best practice and help weaker schools.</p> <p> But critics have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/jun/15/few-multi-academy-trusts-good-enough-improve-schools-says-sir-michael-wilshaw\">questioned how well this system actually works</a>, pointing out that many Mats have expanded rapidly and been unable to support all of their schools. The research suggests it\u2019s a complex situation, with studies reporting varying success in raising student attainment. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/teacher-network/2016/jul/27/six-things-schools-must-know-before-joining-multi-academy-trust\">Joining a multi-academy trust? Ask these questions first</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>\u2018Considerable variation\u2019 in performance<br></h2> <p>When <a href=\"http://epi.org.uk/report/school-performance-multi-academy-trusts-local-authorities/\">the Education Policy Institute (EPI)</a> controversially compared Mats with local authority maintained schools it found a mixed picture.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u201cWe found considerable variation between the performance of Mats,\u201d says Jon Andrews, director of education data and statistics at EPI. \u201cIt shows there\u2019s not much difference between schools in Mats and schools in local authorities.\u201d</p> <p>Meanwhile, the National Foundation for Educational Research\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.nfer.ac.uk/publications/LGGG01/LGGG01_home.cfm\" draggable=\"true\">recent study of academies</a> found no short-term benefits in the performance of primary school pupils. And the difference in GCSE performance was small, according to the report \u2013 the number of pupils achieving 5 or more A*\u2013C grades was 2.7% higher in sponsored academies and 1.1% higher in converter academies. </p> <h2>\u2018Pretty average\u2019 impact on disadvantaged pupils<br></h2> <p> The Sutton Trust\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.suttontrust.com/researcharchive/chaineffects2016/\" draggable=\"true\">2016 chain effects study</a> looked specifically at the impact of joining a Mat on disadvantaged pupils in sponsored academies, and found that doing so was often not beneficial for these pupils. </p> <p>\u201cSome chains do appear to have transformed the chances of their disadvantaged pupils,\u201d says Merryn Hutchings, a professor at London Metropolitan University, who conducted the research. \u201cBut most are pretty average and don\u2019t make much difference. And some of them are simply appalling.\u201d</p> <h2>\u2018Improvements take time to emerge\u2019</h2> <p>But some studies have been more positive about school partnerships. The most extensive investigation into federations, <a href=\"http://dera.ioe.ac.uk/12140/1/download%3Fid%3D155373%26filename%3Dthe-impact-of-school-federation-on-student-outcomes.pdf\">carried out in 2011 by Christoper Chapman</a> [pdf], professor of educational policy and practice at the University of Glasgow, is optimistic about their effects on student outcomes. Researchers found that hard federations (where two or more schools operate under one governing body), had a positive impact on pupil results in both higher- and lower-performing schools. This was the case for both maintained schools and academies.</p> <p>\u201cWe found that the GCSE performance of federations was significantly higher than their non-federated counterparts,\u201d says Chapman. </p> <p>Chapman found a time lag of two to four years from when a federation was formed to it overtaking non-federated schools \u2013 suggesting that improvements take time to emerge. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/teacher-network/2016/may/25/school-governors-vs-academy-trustees-whats-the-difference\">School governors vs academy trustees: what's the difference?</a> </p> </aside>  <h2><strong>What works: size, geography and leadership</strong></h2> <p>Given the huge variation that research has revealed, what is it that makes a Mat or federation effective? And what is it that makes them fail? One problem identified by the Sutton Trust is the speed of growth. </p> <p>\u201cSome chains have been able to grow very quickly and while occasionally that might work if they already have good structures, it\u2019s generally quite hard,\u201d says Hutchings. \u201cMats must have a track record of improving schools before they\u2019re given any more schools to improve.\u201d</p> <p>Research suggests a Mat is more likely to be effective if it is focused in one area of the country, with centralised decision-making. </p> <p>\u201cSome of the big chains that haven\u2019t done terribly well have schools dotted all over the country,\u201d Hutchings adds. \u201cSchools can\u2019t learn from one another or get headteachers together if the schools are scattered.\u201d <br></p> <p>Strong leadership is also important, Chapman says. \u201cYou need professionals who see the benefit of working across schools, otherwise they retrench into their own school and the opportunities to practise knowledge and expertise across the Mat are lost.\u201d</p> <p>Focusing on quick fixes rather than long-term solutionsis a common cause of problems, Chapman continues. \u201cYou can get a series of false dawns. People are sold a vision of coming together, but the aspiration isn\u2019t realised, because they\u2019re focusing on the short term rather than on building a long-term set of shared values and relationships.\u201d</p> <p>In contrast, successful chains have clear policies. \u201cWell-performing chains will give you a list of policies and structures,\u201d says Hutchings. \u201cWhereas some of the chains that are doing really badly don\u2019t seem to have any particular policies or structures \u2013 they\u2019re just drifting along.\u201d </p> <h2>The right incentive</h2> <p>Ultimately, the incentive for joining a Mat is key, says Chapman. \u201cIf it\u2019s externally mandated as an issue of performance, it needs to be managed very carefully. This is different to a school choosing to join through their own interest, desire and aspirations. In this case it tends to become more challenging, depending on the quality of the leadership.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/teacher-network/2016/aug/31/great-expectations-how-to-help-your-students-fulfil-their-potential\">Great expectations: how to help your students fulfil their potential</a> </p> </aside>  <p>So what should schools thinking of joining a federation bear in mind? \u201cThe advice boils down to: do your due diligence,\u201d says Cruddas. \u201cResearch. Find out as much as you can about the trust that you\u2019re considering joining. </p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of data out there now \u2013 such as <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/multi-academy-trust-performance-measures-2014-to-2015\">Mat data</a> from the Department of Education. But your due diligence needs to extend beyond that. Find out whether this group is a good match for your school in terms for everything it stands for. Its vision, its values, its ethos, its curriculum model. Is it right for the children in your school?\u201d</p> <p>If so, you could reap the rewards of collaboration. However, Hutchings offers a warning. \u201cIt\u2019s not a panacea to join a chain. It\u2019s not going to solve everybody\u2019s problems. Look at the pupil results of other schools and ask about their policies.

He has then killed himself. </p> <p>And in searching for answers, we are told what an honourable man the murderer was: \u201ca valuable member of the community\u201d, \u201cvery committed\u201d and \u201cthe most normal person you could meet\u201d. Soon follow the calls for increased funding of mental health services.</p> <p>Two days have passed since the tragic news broke, and today the Irish Times ran a front page reading, \u201c<a href=\"http://www.irishtimes.com/news/ireland/irish-news/cavan-deaths-community-comes-to-terms-with-terrible-tragedy-1.2773014\">Wonderful children who will be missed by all who knew them</a>\u201d. \u201c<a href=\"http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/killed-in-their-pyjamas-by-father-in-frenzied-attack-before-motherinlaw-found-note-35009310.html\">Killed in their pyjamas by father in frenzied attack</a>,\u201d goes one Irish Independent headline alongside a photo of the boys. It is almost as if we\u2019ve already forgotten: they were a family of five. Rest in peace, invisible mother.</p> <p>The picture of the man who killed her, however, is becoming more multi-faceted by the day. Mr Hawe was \u201cquiet and a real gentleman\u201d, says one representative of the local council. </p> <p>His brother goes on to talk about his big passion, handball: he\u2019d \u201cwon a number of titles\u201d, \u201cplayed from about eight years of age\u201d and used to play \u201cwith his brother and his cousin\u201d. A neighbour offers more praise: \u201cHe was the sole person who would do anything for anybody at any time of day or night. He was very obliging.\u201d</p> <p>It makes sense to draw the conclusion that the man must have been carrying some very dark, difficult secrets, that he must have been mentally tortured somehow. Why else would such a lovely man kill his wife and children before taking his own life? </p> <p>(There\u2019s a study in here somewhere, comparing the reporting of events like this with the discourse surrounding abortion and mental health, with women being labelled murderers for ending pregnancies, stopping the growth of sometimes near-invisible clumps of cells, regardless how mentally tortured or suicidal they are). </p> <p>But while a note found at the house suggests that Mr Hawe had been in \u201ca vulnerable state of mind\u201d at the time of the murders \u2013 and while I wholeheartedly agree with calls to end the stigma around mental illness \u2013 there is a different and important narrative for framing these events.</p> <p>We hear about tragic killings like these every now and then. Nine times out of ten (I don\u2019t have statistics, but my hunch is that the figure is far higher), the perpetrator is a man. </p> <p>Lots of people, men and women and non-binary people, struggle with mental illness, but it takes more than mental torture to brutally murder your own children. </p> <p>There is a patriarchal narrative that runs through this entire story, from the act itself to the reporting of it, and we need to allow ourselves to see it if we are to find a way to prevent similar events from happening again.</p> <p>As Paul Gilligan of St Patrick\u2019s university hospital <a href=\"https://www.stpatricks.ie/articles/%E2%80%9Cprotecting-little-innocents%E2%80%9D-irish-examiner-18032013-analysis-paul-gilligan-ceo-st-patrick\">pointed out</a>, killing a child requires a certain view of children, an idea that they must be controlled and managed and, in the case of murder suicides, that they cannot go on to live without the murderer. </p> <p>This ideal of control is part of the same patriarchal worldview that refuses to label domestic violence for what it is; that insists on publishing praise for a man who has just brutally murdered his wife and three children; that almost entirely omits the one woman from the story.</p> <p>That headline, \u201cKilled in their pyjamas by father in frenzied attack\u201d, continued by saying \u201cbefore mother-in-law found note\u201d. The narrative, of course, is from the viewpoint of the murderer: she was <em>his</em> mother-in-law. She was the children\u2019s grandmother, the murdered woman\u2019s mother. </p> <p>The murdered woman, then, is most often referred to as the murderer\u2019s wife \u2013 relevant only as what she is in relation to the man who killed her. Her name is Clodagh.</p> <p>A man murders four people in Cavan, and we are fed questions and statements of disbelief alongside praise of the murderer as a community man. </p> <p>On the front pages, we see the man and the three children he murdered.

The brazenness of the parade\u2019s originators in 1964, marching proudly through the beleaguered streets that had seen <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2002/aug/24/artsandhumanities.nottinghillcarnival2002\" title=\"\">race riots in 1958</a> and the <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/4871898.stm\" title=\"\">death of Kelso Cochrane</a> in 1959, shouldn\u2019t be underestimated.

  "<p>An Illinois woman is accusing a Catholic hospital of refusing to remove her birth control device because of the hospital system\u2019s religious affiliations, causing her nearly a week of pain and bleeding while she was forced to seek help from a different hospital network.</p> <p>Melanie Jones, who is being represented by attorneys with the American Civil Liberties Union of Illinois, said she dislodged her copper intrauterine device (IUD), a form of long-acting birth control, in 2008 when she slipped and fell on a wet bathroom floor. After a night of cramping and bleeding, she went to a hospital controlled by the Chicago-based Mercy Hospital and Medical Center network, where a doctor confirmed that her IUD needed to be removed.</p> <p>But the doctor refused to remove it, Jones claims in <a href=\"http://www.aclu-il.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/2016-8-22_Redacted-Charge-of-Discrimination-Melanie-Jones.pdf\">two separate</a> <a href=\"http://www.aclu-il.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/2016-6-30_Melanie-Jones-OCR-Complaint.pdf\">lawsuits</a>, saying the hospital\u2019s \u201cCatholic initiative\u201d barred her from providing any care related to contraception. In fact, the doctor allegedly told her, every single provider in her Blue Cross Blue Shield Insurance network followed the same religious restrictions. </p> <p>Jones left the hospital with her IUD still dislodged, leaving her \u201cat risk for infection, cervical and uterine lacerations, and scarring, and pregnancy\u201d, she claims in her suits. Because she could not pay out-of-pocket for a visit to the emergency room, she did not get her IUD removed for another five days, when Blue Cross Blue Shield moved her coverage to a secular network of hospitals.</p> <p>\u201cI felt shocked, judged, and angry,\u201d said Jones, in a <a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/blog/speak-freely/i-needed-treatment-not-judgment-my-catholic-hospital\">letter</a> published by the ACLU. \u201cI left my appointment feeling worse than when I arrived \u2013 stigmatized, in pain and bleeding, facing the prospect of waiting an entire month before I could get the care I needed.\u201d</p> <p>Hospitals with Catholic sponsorship require all their medical personnel to follow a set of rules, known as the Ethical and Religious Directives for Catholic Health Care Services, laid out by the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops. The rules prohibit healthcare professionals from offering services that \u201cpromote or condone\u201d contraception and ban abortion unless the termination of the pregnancy is incidental to saving a mother\u2019s life.</p> <p>Catholic ethicists argue that the rules are consistent with modern standards of care. But public health advocates have warned that the rules are subject to arbitrary interpretations, and that they pose a special threat to women\u2019s reproductive care. </p> <p>A spokeswoman for Trinity Health, a Catholic hospital network that includes Mercy Health and Medical Center, denied Jones\u2019s allegations. </p> <p>\u201cThis claim has no merit,\u201d said the spokeswoman, Eve Pidgeon. \u201cThe treatment Ms Jones received at Mercy was entirely consistent with the standards of high-quality care. Ms Jones described to our clinical team a dislodged or troublesome IUD. When our Mercy physician followed our protocol and offered to remove the IUD, Ms Jones declined the removal and left the clinic.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOur priority at Mercy and throughout Trinity Health is the safety and wellbeing of the people we serve,\u201d she continued, \u201cand we are committed to the high-quality care our ministry has provided for more than 150 years.\u201d</p> <p>But Jones is not the first woman to accuse Trinity of illegally denying essential care. In 2011, the ACLU sued the Catholic hospital network for failing to offer a full slate of treatment options to a woman who was miscarrying.</p> <p>The woman, Tamesha Means, claimed she went to Mercy Health Partners (a Trinity hospital) for severe pain and that she showed signs of a significant infection that could worsen until she delivered. Because the doctor was unwilling to use artificial means to hasten her miscarriage \u2013 the hospital considered that an abortion \u2013 the doctor sent her home. It took her two days to miscarry. </p> <p>\u201cAt no time did [Mercy Health Partners] inform Ms Means that there was virtually no chance her fetus would survive, or that there was a high risk to her health if she continued the pregnancy,\u201d her lawsuit stated. The lawsuit was thrown out on jurisdictional grounds.</p> <p>Earlier this year, the Guardian <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/18/michigan-catholic-hospital-women-miscarriage-abortion-mercy-health-partners\">revealed</a> that Mercy Health Partners was accused of risking the lives of four other women in addition to Means. The women were all undergoing potentially deadly miscarriages, internal documents claimed, but Mercy Health Partners doctors refused to artificially speed up their miscarriages because they considered that to be abortion. As a result, records showed, some of the women suffered infections and sepsis or were unnecessarily subjected to surgery.</p> <p>The number of Catholic hospitals in the US has risen steadily for at least a decade. Since 2001, the number of hospitals with Catholic ties has gone up by 22%, mostly through sales of hospitals to major Catholic systems and mergers.</p> <p>One out of every six beds in the country\u2019s acute care hospitals is in a hospital with Catholic affiliations, according to a May <a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/healthcaredenied\">report</a> by the American Civil Liberties Union and MergerWatch, a public health watchdog that monitors healthcare institutions with religious affiliations. Today, Catholic hospitals make up 15%, or 548, of the country\u2019s acute care centers. In dozens of communities, the only hospitals that remain are Catholic.</p> <p>\u201cI do not want to imagine \u2026 what could happen to other women like me who go to Mercy seeking healthcare and do not have the resources I had,\u201d Jones said in her letter. \u201cThis can happen to any woman. Not everyone will be so fortunate.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>While on holiday in New York City a few years ago, I arranged to meet a friend for lunch. \u201cLet\u2019s go for Mexican food in Manhattan,\u201d he said. \u201cI need to get the new <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/mar/26/jace-clayton-dj-rapture\">DJ /rupture CD</a>, and you can only buy it if you go in person to this tiny taco shop in the East Village.\u201d I burst out laughing. For a digital-age pioneer like DJ /rupture (real name Jace Clayton), it seemed like a contrarian, counter-intuitive move. So we went along to Tacos Zaragoza, ate hearty homemade stews at the bodega\u2019s solitary table, then bought <a href=\"http://www.negrophonic.com/2013/new-cumbia-mix-rupture-vs-sonido-martines/\">copies of the mix CD</a>, a compilation of below-the-radar cumbia tracks made in the US, fizzing with energy (and now, available <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.negrophonic.com/2014/dj-rupture-enero-2013-cumbia-mix/\">online</a>).</p> <p>It was just one of Clayton\u2019s playful projects dedicated to celebrating the world\u2019s music in its glorious variety \u2013 not in snobbish opposition to western pop, but rubbing up happily alongside it. After more than 15 years of touring, writing his <a href=\"http://www.negrophonic.com/\">Mudd Up blog</a> and digitally enhanced globe-trotting, Clayton has published his first book, Uproot: Travels in 21st-Century Music and Digital Culture. It is a tome as sprawling and excitable in its subject matter as one of the mixes that launched his career as a DJ 15 years ago. </p> <p>We discover the subversive power of Autotune when used by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/dec/30/the-playlist-best-middle-eastern-north-african-music-of-2014\">Berber folk singers</a>, the new technologically enhanced languages (musical and otherwise) springing up in Egypt, why Celine Dion and Michael Bolton are gods to Jamaican reggae fans, and Clayton\u2019s attempts to get big business to fund his \u201c<a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.beyond-digital.org/sufiplugins/\">Sufi plug-ins</a>\u201d project, free computer music software using north African soundbanks.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Going to get a taco, hanging out with the slightly eccentric shop-owner \u2013 it\u2019s all part of the music in some level</p> <footer> <cite>DJ/Rupture</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>On the phone from a library in Manhattan, I remind Clayton about the taco shop cumbia project. \u201cIt was partially just internet burnout, but it was also a homage to the idea of a cumbia <em>sonidero </em>[host or MC],\u201d he says. \u201cFor the infrastructure of the scene, going to get a taco, hanging out with the slightly eccentric shop-owner \u2013 it\u2019s all part of the music in some level, so I thought let\u2019s make it explicit.\u201d </p> <p>Clayton explains cumbia as a real world peer-to-peer network, embedded in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qeaXAyvOrwM\">working-class Hispanic communities</a> in the US and Latin America alike, mutating the sound every time it moves.</p> <p>Cumbia is in some respects exceptional, because it is relatively self-contained, uses the internet on its own terms, and seems uninterested in \u201ccrossing over\u201d or creating stars \u2013 but it has acquired a similar global cult following to many other non-western genres in the internet era; just without the more faddish sporadic western interest shown to say K-pop (Gangnam Style is a very 21st-century phenomenon) or South African house (remember DJ Mujava\u2019s Township Funk?). Clayton traces the ways the digital revolution has transformed the unfashionable idea of \u201cworld music\u201d that was solidified in the 1980s.</p> <p>The term was coined <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2004/jun/29/popandrock1\">when a group of 19 record label owners</a>, journalists and radio DJs met in a north London pub and tried to name a genre category to help record shops sell the music \u2013 no one was finding it, buried in the jazz or folk sections. Until the 2000s, western gatekeepers were excessively powerful and decided what reached fans in Europe and North America \u2013 with an often-lamented, neo-colonial aspect to the \u201cdiscovery\u201d and fetishising of the music and its creators.</p> <p>For Clayton, the internet has transformed this arrangement, creating \u201cworld music 2.0\u201d \u2013 making entire genres accessible at the click of a button, first via chat-rooms and file-sharing sites, and now YouTube or online shopping \u2013 but in some respects, the industry gatekeeping remains. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"fed024de24ff1810893647afc9083e559bb39d73\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fed024de24ff1810893647afc9083e559bb39d73/0_59_1600_2000/800.jpg\" alt=\"Jace Clayton aka DJ/Rupture.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jace Clayton aka DJ /rupture.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Max Lakner</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cFor me, the \u20182.0\u2019 refers to all the crazy, slippery digital stuff you can access out there as an online listener,\u201d he explains. \u201cBut once you get into the specifics of European or American tours, or the festival circuit, suddenly that same industry infrastructure, selection and contextualisation by a few people occurs. So you\u2019re still told \u2018<em>This</em> is the Saharan desert blues band that you must hear\u2019 \u2013 as if there aren\u2019t hundreds of different bands, doing hundreds of different things.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s a process that remains arbitrary and mysterious \u2013 Syrian dabke musician <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/aug/20/omar-souleyman-syrian-wedding-singer-wooing-the-west\">Omar Souleyman</a> is a prime example: signed to world music label Sublime Frequencies, he has released several albums in the west, played Glastonbury and sold thousands of albums and concert tickets in Europe and the US \u2013 but Clayton is slightly baffled. \u201cNone of the dabke fans I\u2019ve met have ever heard of him. I get most of my dabke in Arab music shops here in Brooklyn, and it\u2019s crazy and interesting, all this weird stuff \u2013 but I\u2019ve never seen Omar Souleyman\u2019s CDs.\u201d</p> <p>Clayton is not out to criticise Souleyman or his label, but observes that some of the same arbitrary cherry-picking processes remain in place from the pre-digital age; he tells the story of the Master Musicians of Jajouka, a traditional Berber group beloved across the west, first produced by Brian Jones in 1971, they also received visits and collaborations from Mick Jagger, Billy Corgan, Ornette Coleman, William Burroughs and Lee Ranaldo. And yet despite this fame, the group are \u201cunknown a few towns over\u201d, and their music is unfindable at local tape stalls. \u201cIt slowly dawned on me,\u201d Clayton writes in Uproot, \u201cthat the music that got lauded within Morocco had virtually no overlap with the stuff successfully presented outside its borders.\u201d</p> <p>Uproot\u2019s strength is Clayton\u2019s determination to look beyond the easy answers: he enthuses about the liberatory potential of the new connections, fusions and mutations encouraged by digital music, and globally available cheap software like FruityLoops, but is keen we shouldn\u2019t overlook its limitations. \u201cThe first time I noticed this was back in 2002: I remember Kid606 saying to me, \u2018Hey check out this music\u2019, and it was just really bad, generic techno. I asked him \u2018Why are you playing me this?\u2019 and he said \u2018Because it\u2019s from Algeria!\u2019. He\u2019d picked it up in an obscure chat-room. And there was a moment of realisation where we both said, \u2018Oh, they\u2019re just using the same FruityLoops presets in Algeria\u2019.\u201d </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/nov/06/highlife-dj-auntie-flo\">Living the Highlife: the global party scene taking world music into the future</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The same, he said, goes for remix apps for smartphones and tablets, which vastly constrain the possibilities of what a remix might be: \u201cJust looking around, I\u2019m slightly horrified, because it\u2019s so minimal, the changes you can make: \u2018press this button for \u2018siren\u2019, \u2018press this button to change the backing beat to \u2018rock\u2019, it\u2019s so limited.\u201d</p> <p>Generally, Clayton is excited about the same things the music industry panics about, and the way even big stars like Kanye and Beyonc\u00e9 are tinkering with old logic and protocols \u2013 \u201cI want the giants to fall even faster,\u201d he writes in Uproot, \u201cso we can see what weird flowers start blooming in the spaces left vacant.\u201d </p> <p>One of very few manifesto-style demands he makes is for technological innovators to find a way to compensate artists for the music they make \u2013 directly, and as fully as possible. \u201cThat came from looking into the huge cellphone banking boom in Africa,\u201d he recalls. \u201cIt feels like the technology is almost in place, to allow that if someone makes a beat on their laptop, they could sell it on their phone, and get all the money for it, direct. It comes down to this basic thing \u2013 how to give, say, a weird Angolan techno producer their dues?\u201d</p> <p>For Clayton, the threats to the old ways are mostly a litany of new opportunities \u2013 he describes the Egyptian genre sha3by<em> </em>(the 3 is not a typo \u2013 it\u2019s <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic_chat_alphabet\">Arabizi</a>) as \u201cantisentimental and ultralocal\u201d \u2013 doesn\u2019t that apply to all the music he loves? \u201cDefinitely, a lot of the stuff I talk about falls into that category. This sense that there\u2019s nothing sentimental about the act of creation, but instead more generosity, and messiness. Let\u2019s not be sentimental about musical history, and respect it too much: we\u2019re not tied down to the past, we\u2019re here now, let\u2019s just make something and throw it out there.\u201d</p> <ul> <li>Uproot: Travels in 21st Century Music and Digital Culture is out now via FSG<br></li> </ul>",
  "<h2>NORTH v SOUTH</h2> <p>A new season starts with an old argument. The global calendar, a concept which has for most of the decade casually been kicked around like a ball in a warm-up, is an issue <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/25/premiership-rugby-mark-mccafferty-global-calendar-talks\">that is now being taken seriously</a>.<br></p> <p>There is no fit-all solution, no prospect of the seasons in the hemispheres being played simultaneously so one has to operate in its summer. It is about trying to find a way of playing club/regional/franchise rugby in a different window to the international game. And trying is the word.</p> <p>New Zealand have applied electric shock therapy by saying they are not prepared to sign up to a new Test tour schedule to replace the one that runs out after the 2019 World Cup if it means the two hemispheres trudge on tour at the end of their respective long seasons.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/01/lions-tour-treadmill-premiership-pro-12-rugby\">Lions tour the prize but first comes treadmill even robots would find wearing | Robert Kitson</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The All Blacks would go it alone. If one of the European nations wanted them to visit, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/24/global-rugby-union-season-talks-stall-2019-fixture-list\">it would have to strike a deal</a>, something that would also operate in reverse. Under the current tour agreement, the host nation banks all the profits from a match, paying the visitors\u2019 hotel and transport expenses.</p> <p>The four home unions and France earn (much) more from a match against the All Blacks than New Zealand do for playing any one of them at home. Market forces: there are millions more chimney pots in Europe than there are in the major southern hemisphere nations; New Zealand\u2019s population is not much more than half of London\u2019s.</p> <p>The New Zealand Union has done remarkably well to sustain success at international level at a time when French clubs are offering players seven-figure salaries and Japan has become a major importer of talent, but it feels it has maximised its financial potential at home and so has to look elsewhere.</p> <p>It knows that as it continues to produce players of such quality that even figures such as Richie McCaw, Dan Carter, Ma\u2019a Nonu and Conrad Smith are barely missed, so it will have to work harder to hold on to them. The All Blacks\u2019 jersey is so alluring that McCaw denied himself the chance of earning substantially more abroad to continue wearing it, even if at the same time he probably extended his playing career.</p> <p>Australia and South Africa are not so fortunate, two of the game\u2019s superpowers who look in decline, with England now closest to New Zealand in the world rankings \u2013 they have been prey to the greater financial muscle of clubs in Europe. If the current tour schedule works in any way for them it is to make French owners ponder the wisdom of signing players who may not be around for much of the first three months of the season, and June; not that it has stopped them so far.</p> <p>There is little sympathy in Europe for the relative financial weakness of the south and even less enthusiasm to split the proceeds from tour matches evenly, although that stance has not stopped some on the four home unions from arguing the next Lions deal with New Zealand, Australia and South Africa should give them a chunk of the profits from each tour. Yet there would be significant ramifications here should countries which have customarily been in the top five of the world rankings in the professional era, and very often in the leading three, lose their lustre.</p> <p>One argument why there should be no revenue sharing is that the unions here have all redeveloped their grounds at considerable expense and should be able to enjoy the rewards. New Zealand, Australia and South Africa play Test matches all over their countries rather than in one base, although two of the Tests against the Lions next year will be at Eden Park, and only Sydney competes with Twickenham, Paris and Cardiff in terms of capacity.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"19a143a61c643b8c37eb57517098a11c9a346bac\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/19a143a61c643b8c37eb57517098a11c9a346bac/0_0_5184_3109/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Twickenham\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The RFU recently entered into a \u00a350m revolving credit facility with RBS over five years to finance the east stand redevelopment at Twickenham.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Clive Rose/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Stadium development was funded by loans: earlier this year the Rugby Football Union entered into a \u00a350m revolving credit facility with RBS over five years to finance the east stand redevelopment at Twickenham, which will start after next year\u2019s Six Nations, as well as the laying of artificial pitches at community level, two-thirds of which has already been drawn down.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/31/ben-teo-worcester-rugby-union-league-sam-burgess\">Ben Te\u2019o: \u2018Some people in union love that Sam Burgess went back\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Loans are granted not least on income projection. Take out autumn home matches against New Zealand, South Africa and Australia and the three Celtic unions are in financial trouble and the RFU\u2019s \u00a3152m annual turnover suffers a tumble. The hemispheres are in it together and a danger of failing to agree a tour schedule after 2019, or taking talks down to the wire as seems to be the way now, would be to create a vacuum that would probably be filled by clubs, and not just ones in England and France.</p> <p>The game has stretched itself in the last 20 years to generate the money to pay players and coaches: even the RFU blew its international playing budget last season through generous bonuses for the Six Nations title and the grand slam. A season that used to run from the beginning of September to the end of April, with a June tour more occasional than routine, now starts with friendlies in August and extends to the end of May \u2013 longer in France where the Top 14 will again stretch into June having kicked off two weekends ago.</p> <p>A global season, in which everything was synchronised, would work only if Test sides were fed by a league made up of sides from the two hemispheres, Super Rugby meets the European Champions Cup. The two windows would be separate, but that would devalue domestic leagues, something the Top 14 and Premiership rugby would not consider, never mind accept.</p> <p>And so the debate will go on, more questions than answers. The new campaign promises much in England, where if Gloucester and Bath pick up, Harlequins add growl to their bite and Northampton loosen up, the battle for the top four places will be intense. The Pro12 needs the Welsh regions to come out of hibernation, while Conor O\u2019Shea\u2019s move to Italy should galvanise Treviso and Zebre.</p> <p>The global season issue will run in the background.

In a world where even the most ardently future-facing artists are eventually pinned down and pigeonholed, she\u2019s spent much of the last decade bulldozing her way through fads and phases, sidestepping the new boring, upstaging the queen of pop and \u2013 somehow, throughout it all \u2013 sustaining sonic relevance.</p> <p>Even in a year in which our most prominent artists are exploring their creative limits \u2013 Frank Ocean\u2019s week-long carpentry live stream; <a href=\"http://insider.foxnews.com/2016/08/29/beyonce-mtv-video-music-awards-performance-gun-violence-police-shootings\">Beyonce\u2019s interpretation of the atrocities of gun crime</a> aired on primetime TV \u2013 the Sri Lankan rapper\u2019s originality remains unmatched. Yet there is something absent on AIM, an album she <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jul/15/mia-aim-last-album\">recently claimed</a> would be her last. Sure, there is vision, scope and experimentation \u2013 there\u2019s even an inexplicable cameo from the world\u2019s most famous former boy band member \u2013 but for the most part, AIM is frustratingly unfocused.</p> <p>It\u2019s disheartening, not least because the initial signs around her fifth album were so promising. The hypnotic teaser song Swords (which features on the deluxe version of AIM) is sparse and slick, fusing samples of clanging metal and arriving with a triumphant video starring a group of sword-wielding female dancers. Then came her official return with Borders \u2013 released at the tail end of 2015, it exhibited MIA\u2019s ability to scale a pop culture framework while providing serious political messages. A stark, brutalist construction, it infused eastern and western sounds, and pit basic, benign web-speak (\u201cbeing bae\u201d, \u201cbreaking the internet\u201d, \u201cqween\u201d) against sincere statements of compassion. The video was similarly affecting: a cinematic depiction of the refugee crisis that featured a cast of men scaling barbed wire fences and lying lifelessly on a flotilla of boats laden with bodies.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-Nw7HbaeWY\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/r-Nw7HbaeWY?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-Nw7HbaeWY\">Borders by MIA on YouTube</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Given that Richard Ashcroft appears to be the only other mainstream artist to have recognised the migrant crisis <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21894-these-people/\">in song</a> this year, the visibility of MIA \u2013 a refugee who escaped the Sri Lankan civil war \u2013 seemed vital in 2016.

Joyousness is something MIA has imbued in many of her hits, from the braggadocious Bucky Done Gun to the glamorous world-beat of Bad Girls. On AIM, however, any upbeat energy that does exist is denied the space to thrive. Instead we get clutter and noise, the product of a fragmented attention span. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGDhHxgY6uo\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/kGDhHxgY6uo?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGDhHxgY6uo\">Go Off by MIA on YouTube</a></figcaption> </figure>  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/aug/31/best-music-autumn-2016-bjork-david-bowie-pink-floyd-saint-etienne-autumn-arts-preview\">It's oh so cultural: the sharpest sounds of autumn 2016</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Go Off, produced by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/skrillex\">Skrillex</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2008/nov/05/mia-tom-waits-blaqstarr-the-wire\">Blaqstarr</a>, is all big drops and bluster; once the initial blow of the thuds subside you\u2019re left with little desire to return to the wreckage. The same fleeting pleasure can be felt on Bird Song, a lumbering list of winged animals set to a kazoo-like caw. On Jump, as MIA\u2019s vocals stutter and overlap rather than creating the rhythmic soundscape she may have intended, it pushes the limits of the listener\u2019s patience. Freedun, which features the subtle, syrupy vocals of former One Direction member<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jun/02/lessons-from-adele-justin-bieber-and-zayn-on-having-a-hit-number-one-no-1\"> Zayn Malik</a>, is a better example of her buoyant capabilities; it bubbles and crunches, a cartoonish creation that elevates the middle section of the album, even if Malik and Maya appear to be channelling different spirits.</p> <p>Her mellifluous excursions work best. \u201cWhat haters say about me don\u2019t worry me, I keep it moving forward to what\u2019s ahead of me,\u201d she raps on Finally, a breezy dalliance with dancehall. Its approachability does not exist on the majority of AIM. These are global-facing pop songs that somehow have no place: too slow for a club, too confrontational for the bedroom, too skatty for the radio. It sounds as if AIM was made exclusively for MIA\u2019s benefit: one final eruption of inventive and sometimes incoherent ideas. Apt, perhaps, that an artist so vehemently punk bows out with an album so stubbornly hers.</p>",
  "<p>The vote that sealed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/31/dilma-rousseff-impeached-president-brazilian-senate-michel-temer\" title=\"\">Michel Temer\u2019s installation into power in Brazil</a> took place precisely one week after the end of the Rio Olympic Games and just days before the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/31/china-hangzhou-propaganda-facelift-g20-summit\" title=\"\">G20 summit</a>. Major disturbances were avoided during the Games and the new president was confirmed in his post just in time to take his flight and enjoy a convenient round of handshakes and photos with world leaders in China. Everything was carefully planned to make the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/31/the-guardian-view-on-brazil-dilma-rousseffs-downfall-wont-cure-all-her-countrys-ills\" title=\"\">arbitrary removal of a democratically elected president</a> look like business as usual.</p> <p>That\u2019s not to say the new leadership in Brazil isn\u2019t worried about whether it appears legitimate. Over the past few months, the alliance forged to oust Dilma Rousseff rejected calling the impeachment process that it was sponsoring a coup d\u2019\u00e9tat. Some even threatened to take legal action against those making this claim in official debates. Their narrative insisted that constitutional procedures were observed.</p> <p>It is true that, unlike the sudden impeachment carried out after just a couple of days in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jun/22/paraguay-fernando-lugo-ousted\" title=\"\">Paraguay in 2012</a>, or the clear use of force in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/jun/29/manuel-zelaya-honduras-coup-protests\" title=\"\">Honduras in 2009</a>, formalities were observed in the surreal trial of Rousseff. For over five months alleged government accounting irregularities were treated as one of the most serious crimes in Brazilian political history and were carefully analysed by zealous legislators, including some accused of many crimes themselves, ranging from corruption to money laundering. Suddenly the same country that was capable of silently coping with a routine of impunity in notorious cases of state violence, such as the mass murder of street children or landless workers, became fixated on the legality of administrative budgeting orders.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Rousseff\u2019s fate was decided long before the last vote in the senate</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Irrespective of such bizarre and creative legal analysis, Rousseff\u2019s fate was decided long before the last vote in the senate, by the collapse of the heterogeneous coalition that sustained her government and that made her the easy prey of an ultra-conservative legislature rattled by uncontrolled corruption investigations.</p> <p>This transition sheds light on the structural weaknesses of Brazil\u2019s democracy. The conservative congressmen who led the process of impeachment had been, in fact, key supporters of Rousseff, and of all other presidents of Brazil since the end of the dictatorship in 1985. Without their support, government majority in parliament would be impossible. With the arrival of Temer to the top post, this collection of ultra-conservative and corrupt forces has finally achieved hegemonic control over the executive and legislative branches.</p> <p>Even with the careful re-arrangement of forces in the parliament and the enthusiastic support of the Brazilian mainstream media (often controlled by politicians), it is hard to believe that Temer will enjoy the same calm mood he should now meet in China. Judicial investigations of corruption are still ongoing and threaten Temer personally and his most direct allies, and political polarisation remains at an all-time high in Brazil.</p> <p>The impeachment of Rousseff will leave deep scars in political and institutional life. Not only will the country be headed by an artificial leadership arrangement; the new coalition comes to power imposing a radical turn to the right which was defeated in four previous elections. Law reforms are to be pushed through by the new leadership to undermine laws protecting workers and severely restricting mandatory expenditure in health and education over the next decades as the magical solution to restore global trust in the country\u2019s economy. Parliament is also on the verge of concluding a stream of measures undermining rights in critical areas such as the defence of indigenous lands and the environment, as well as threatening sexual and reproductive rights.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/31/the-guardian-view-on-brazil-dilma-rousseffs-downfall-wont-cure-all-her-countrys-ills\">The Guardian view on Brazil: Dilma Rousseff\u2019s downfall won\u2019t cure all her country\u2019s ills | Editorial</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Brazilian crisis is not unique. Perhaps as a late consequence of the global economic debacle of 2008, mainstream political forces in all regions are now dealing with very high levels of dissatisfaction and battling strident voices and movements. In some places, this new wave is resulting in violence and serious damage to the rule of law and democracy.</p> <p>In Brazil it is clear that the combined economic and political crisis is offering a golden opportunity for an ultra-conservative alliance to regain control of power and demolish part of the legacy of the brief democratic experience. Such a dramatic ending of what was once believed to be one of the very few positive experiences of pragmatic left leadership in the global south will certainly resonate beyond its borders, particularly in Latin America. The tasks of promoting democracy and human rights in an extremely unequal society are far more complex than Brazil once made the world believe.</p>",
  "<p>Thirty years ago next month, down a back street in Hull, the war finally came to an end.<br></p> <p>The victors didn\u2019t waste any time. No sooner had the defending army \u2013 the self-proclaimed Northern Allied Axis Society \u2013 vacated its camp on 21 October 1986, than a bulldozer moved in to clear up. A snapper from the local paper captured the moment a small girl, crying, was comforted by the defeated general, who happened to be her dad. And that was that.</p> <p>Homes had been destroyed and a whole neighbourhood gutted; babies born and at least one person died. But now \u2018Major General\u2019 Nuttall was just plain old Barry again: a barrel-chested 38-year-old family man with a wife and seven kids to support. It was as though the previous seven years \u2013 the battle of Melbourne Grove, the siege of Wyndham Street \u2013 had simply never happened. </p> <p>Three decades later, on an overcast summer afternoon, I am wheeling my bike down Argyle Street looking for traces of this infamous (in Hull, at least) conflict. I must have been down here hundreds of times before \u2013 trudging back on foot after another desperate 90 minutes of football at the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hull_City_A.F.C.\">KCOM stadium</a>. But besides idly wondering how the burger van on the corner keeps going when it\u2019s not match day, or whose job it is to clear up the rubbish, it\u2019s not an area of Hull I\u2019d ever thought about much.</p> <p>That changed when I heard about Barry Nuttall. If this man hadn\u2019t existed, you couldn\u2019t make him up. Other protesters may have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/dec/19/dale-farm-travellers-face-eviction-again\">staged sit-ins</a> to try to stop local authorities from demolishing their homes. But dressed up as a second world war US major general, backed by a contingent of military re-enactment enthusiasts? Not so much.</p> <p>Nuttall was a jack of all trades; he\u2019d worked in a wood yard, on barges, as a DJ and a bouncer. He had also done a stint as a garage mechanic, which is how he learned the knack of restoring his growing collection of old military vehicles. He drove these jeeps and troop carriers to re-enactment events throughout the north, along with his band of brothers in the Northern Allied-Axis Society.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"a472582ad075cb47ace58c40fe600cda49ac5adf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a472582ad075cb47ace58c40fe600cda49ac5adf/0_0_1228_1818/675.jpg\" alt=\"Barry Nuttall\" width=\"675\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A member of Nuttall\u2019s army hoists a union flag amid the rubble.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jim Holmes</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>So when the council announced its plans to demolish all the two-up, two-downs in the area without offering what Nuttall considered adequate compensation, he and his army were ready. In 1983, the national press were there to witness their showdown with police and bailiffs on the terraced streets off Spring Bank in central Hull. The battle dragged on and it took a compulsory purchase order for the demolition to go ahead \u2013 but even then, the matter was far from settled.</p> <p>Nuttall retreated, but only as far as nearby Wyndham Street, where he built a fortress in the wreckage of his own home and dug in with his army \u2013 for three more years.<br></p> <h2>Urban legend</h2> <p>It is said that Nuttall only left his makeshift camp twice: to present a petition to the House of Commons, and to marry his second wife, Alyson. This was not just another planning dispute; it\u2019s the stuff of urban legend. </p> <p>Nuttall\u2019s stand-off had deep roots in Hull\u2019s post-war housing policy \u2013 itself a reaction to the squalor of the city\u2019s 19th-century slums and the devastation of second world war bombing. But the events of 30 years ago also have echoes right down to the present day, through Hull\u2019s patchy post-war architecture and even in the city\u2019s recent, overwhelming vote to leave the European Union.</p> <p>I know next to nothing about how Nuttall survived under canvas for so long, other than that his wife kept him supplied with homemade rock buns. I\u2019d ask the man himself but he died five years ago, and his nearest and dearest won\u2019t talk to me. I\u2019ve been poring through the local newspaper archives at <a href=\"http://www.hullhistorycentre.org.uk/\">Hull History Centre</a> but since they\u2019re mostly on microfilm, it\u2019s an arduous process. My trek down Argyle Street is an excuse to get out, as much as anything.</p> <p>One thing I have gleaned from the archives is just how radically this part of Hull has changed over the last half century. A fascinating series of Ordnance Survey maps, drafted at 10-year intervals, shows the dense Victorian streets being swept away to create the open-plan estate of today. But the road names \u2013 the larger ones at least \u2013 remain the same, and the sign for Wyndham Street soon appears on the right. What was I expecting: a blue plaque? There\u2019d be nowhere to put it.</p> <p>This was where it all happened then. To be fair to the council, the demolition probably made sense in the early 1980s. Hull\u2019s economy was in dire straits: job losses following the collapse of the fishing industry in the late 70s had been compounded by swingeing cutbacks as Thatcherite economic policies started to bite. You can imagine the panic setting in among councils, desperate to stop the rot. Encouraging small business was one solution. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"c70288ab1a2b838c5dbc26cbd348ad55c660a8e8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c70288ab1a2b838c5dbc26cbd348ad55c660a8e8/0_31_3948_2369/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nuttall apparently only left his makeshift camp twice: to present a petition to the House of Commons, and to marry his second wife, Alyson.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nuttall apparently only left his makeshift camp twice: to present a petition to the House of Commons, and to marry his second wife, Alyson.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: J Mitchell/Northcliffe Media/SWNS</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>You could say the stand-off on Melbourne Grove pitched one economic hero of the 80s (the home owner) against another (the entrepreneur). For a while afterwards, Nuttall claimed he still held the deeds to the plot of land on which his house had stood. But if he ever tried to make good on the claim, Bob Harding, owner and managing director of Quality Fixing Supplies, knows nothing about it.</p> <p>Harding sells screws and fixings, mainly to manufacturers of portable buildings and garden furniture. He\u2019s been here for 12 years, has five employees, and says the location is handy for the motorway. Next door, Brad Lake at the <a href=\"http://www.leatherrepaircompany.com/\">Leather Repair Company</a> has just got back from fixing car upholstery over the Humber Bridge in Lincolnshire. He hasn\u2019t heard of Nuttall either.</p> <p>I ask Harding whether his company has much to do with the local community. \u201cNot really,\u201d he says, \u201calthough some of the lads buy their lunch from the burger van on Wyndham Street.\u201d </p> <h2><strong>English </strong>eccentric</h2> <p>If I can\u2019t find any direct evidence of Nuttall\u2019s protest, I can at least talk to someone who was there. The media loved him \u2013 it probably made a welcome change from covering all those factory closures and job losses. Barry and his men offered some light relief and a chance for reporters to dust down their military metaphors.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I turned up and these two guys dressed as American GIs stopped me with mock rifles</p> <footer> <cite>Brian Lavery</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Brian Lavery encountered the major general not long after the siege on Wyndham Street. Nuttall had moved back in with his wife Alyson and their children, and Lavery, <a href=\"http://www.barbicanpress.com/Books/?wpsc-product=the-headscarf-revolutionaries\">now a successful non-fiction author</a> but then a humble freelance writer, knew a good, saleable story when he saw one.</p> <p>\u201cIt was like meeting a Bedouin chief,\u201d Lavery recalls. \u201cI turned up and these two guys dressed as American GIs stopped me with mock rifles. \u2018Identify yourself,\u2019 they said. I told them I\u2019d come to see their major general, and they led me round to the tent at the back where Barry and his wife were sitting behind a trestle table. These two stood to attention either side of me. Then one of them spoke in a mock American accent: \u2018Gentleman of the press to see you, sir!\u2019</p> <p>\u201cIt was easy to laugh at but a lot of people in Hull admired him,\u201d Lavery says. \u201cHe was seen as an English eccentric standing up to \u2018the man\u2019. In Hull, we\u2019re drawn to people who stand up for themselves \u2013 it goes back to the time <a href=\"http://bcw-project.org/military/english-civil-war/northern-england/yorkshire-1642\">we turned King Charles I away</a>. Barry wasn\u2019t daft though. He provided for himself and his family, and he raised money for charity. He won the war of public opinion.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"930120f236f84f06fc48193fe6580e4b35ac155d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/930120f236f84f06fc48193fe6580e4b35ac155d/0_0_1818_1090/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018They\u2019d put the sofas back and rearranged the bricks, so you could see where the rooms had been.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018They\u2019d put the sofas back and rearranged the bricks, so you could see where the rooms had been.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jim Holmes</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Nuttall certainly kept the papers on side during the siege, with a ready grin for any passing press photographer. There\u2019s the one of him in Yorkshire <a href=\"http://www.biography.com/people/telly-savalas-9542523\">Telly Savalas</a> mode, relaxing in his \u201ccastle\u201d, tin mug raised aloft; or on his wedding day in best dress uniform, after he\u2019d borrowed a Cadillac from local crooner Joe Longthorne to get to the church on time. Then there\u2019s him kissing Alyson under the mistletoe before returning to a lonely Christmas vigil on Wyndham Street. He must have missed the attention when it was over. </p> <p>But the best image didn\u2019t make it into the papers. Jim Holmes\u2019s colour photo, taken just after the demolition on Melbourne Grove, has more raw power than any of the staged newspapers snaps. Nuttall, cradling a canteen of rum, is surrounded by the mess that was once his home. He looks angry, and a bit lost.</p> <p>Holmes\u2019s photographs capture this weird war in a cul-de-sac perfectly. Uniformed men hoist Union flags, Iwo Jima-style over the mountain of rubble, while children sit around chatting. But for once, Nuttall is not his usual happy-go-lucky self. </p> <p>Holmes explains: \u201cI was cycling [past] and saw the flags coming over the bricks. I thought: this is never going to happen again, so I went back home to get my camera. It was just them and the site and the bricks and the chimney pots. They\u2019d put the sofas back, and rearranged the bricks so you could see where the rooms had been. There was a chair there and Barry was drinking a bottle of rum. It was great.\u201d</p> <p>It was Holmes who first told me Nuttall\u2019s story one night in a pub, so he\u2019s got a lot to answer for. He retells it one afternoon, sitting out in my back garden. It turns out he had deeper connections to the Battle of Melbourne Grove than I\u2019d realised.</p> <p>In the early 1980s, Holmes was a student at Hull School of Architecture and had bought a house not far from Nuttall\u2019s, on Kimberley Street. He often saw the major general and his men \u201cbombing round on army trucks\u201d, and in the local pub, the Polar Bear. They were, says Holmes, part of a rich street scene that also featured Mrs Allen, who thought herself a \u201ccut above\u201d but wasn\u2019t above dispensing scurrilous gossip; and an \u201cold boy\u201d with rheumy eyes who used to knock on Holmes\u2019s door if he needed an eyelash removing.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"90d425f1418e1a37603ee81f2ff0d6c968bd0780\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/90d425f1418e1a37603ee81f2ff0d6c968bd0780/0_0_1228_1818/675.jpg\" alt=\"Barry Nuttall surrounded by the rubble that was once his home.\" width=\"675\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nuttall surrounded by the rubble that was once his home.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jim Holmes</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIt was a nice place to live at the time; always interesting,\u201d Holmes says. \u201cDown the road was the depot for the railways. There were still shops: a bakery, a toy shop, a club called the Flamingo which I think was a \u2018cat house\u2019. There was a small Italian barber with a nifty moustache who had a salon on Argyle Street and there was a little supermarket. We were there when there were all the power cuts at the end of the Callaghan period \u2013 the winter of discontent. One night in the kitchen, I realised Thatcher was going to get in. I remember thinking: the world\u2019s going to change.\u201d </p> <h2><strong>Bad feeling</strong></h2> <p>Change came quicker than anyone expected. In 1979, the council announced its intention to demolish the area. Holmes seemed the obvious choice to lead the \u201cRetain the Houses\u201d campaign: not only was he local but, as an architecture student, he was aware of the pioneering work by future <a href=\"https://www.architecture.com/Explore/Home.aspx\">Riba</a> president Rod Hackney to fight slum clearances in Macclesfield.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019d been lots of successful schemes for refurbishing Victorian houses, so there was plenty of that stuff going on. [Our houses] were just standard two-up two-downs, so there were perfectly easy ways of making them habitable.\u201d</p> <p>But the campaign, Holmes says, was doomed from the start. \u201cHull\u2019s always been a bit behind the times, in its own little bubble. The last high-rise wasn\u2019t built here until 1979. It was the last public high-rise in England.\u201d</p> <p>With a council seemingly wedded to the idea of \u201cdemolish and rebuild\u201d, the residents\u2019 conservation campaign was further weakened by dissent from within. </p> <p>\u201cA lot of people had moved in [to the area] to get on the council list. People who owned their houses were in favour of keeping them, but those who were in landlord accommodation wanted the houses to come down. So there was a bit of bad feeling.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The campaign was shot down. The houses were judged to be not compatible with human existence</p> <footer> <cite>Jim Holmes</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>At a public inquiry held at Hull Guildhall, the conflict reached its climax. Holmes sat near the Italian barber: \u201cHe got up to object, saying, \u2018I\u2019ve got a business here\u2019 \u2013 but was shouted down. He sat down next to me, then dropped dead on the floor. He\u2019d had a heart attack.</p> <p>\u201cI was pretty green,\u201d Holmes admits. \u201cI had no experience at all in that kind of stuff, and the campaign was shot down. The houses were judged to be not compatible with human existence.\u201d </p> <p>These days, Holmes works for an architectural practice that specialises in making 1960s and 70s council homes compliant with today\u2019s much more rigorous energy conservation rules.</p> <p>\u201cThe houses built following the demolitions were thermally inefficient and difficult to bring up to modern standards. Their electric underfloor heating was a disaster. Terraced houses work better from an ecological point of view, because they\u2019re squashed together and they\u2019ve got a limited external area.\u201d</p> <p>Squashed together; it could apply equally to the lives lived on those old Victorian streets where everyone knew everyone else and, more often than not, shared a surname. It\u2019s the world Barry Nuttall would have known and which Jim Holmes saw the end of; that sense of togetherness, swept away in the great race for urban modernisation after the second world war.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"641777f56ec643bd512708835c2f4e92fbefaa3c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/641777f56ec643bd512708835c2f4e92fbefaa3c/0_0_1026_693/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The cul-de-sac camp was finally forced to leave in 1986.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"675\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The cul-de-sac camp was finally forced to leave in 1986, after three years.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jim Holmes</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Listening to Holmes\u2019s stories about Mrs Allen and the old man with the rheumy eyes reminds me of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/jan/18/featuresreviews.guardianreview24\">Douglas Dunn</a>\u2019s Terry Street poems. Written in the late 1960s, they document the comings and goings of life on another old Hull terrace, now demolished. </p> <p>The best known is probably <a href=\"http://www.poetryarchive.org/poem/removal-terry-street\">A Removal From Terry Street</a>. As the narrator watches his neighbour clearing out to a new estate on the edge of town, he notices him pushing a lawnmower down the street \u2013 an implement he could have had no use for in Terry Street\u2019s grassless, cramped back yards. The poem ends: <em>That man, I wish him well. I wish him grass.</em></p> <p>It\u2019s an optimistic thought but, for some, relocation to an edge-of-town estate meant dislocation from everything familiar. Was it this fear that drove Nuttall to dig in for so long?</p> <h2><strong>Legacy of war</strong></h2> <p>Hull certainly had to do something about its crumbling Victorian housing stock. At a talk at the History Centre on the origins of the city\u2019s council housing, the speaker, local historian <a href=\"http://www.ckg-genealogy.co.uk/\">Carol Kerry-Green</a>, tells a packed audience how massive population growth in the 19th century (from 22,000 in 1801 to 239,000 in 1901) created terrible housing conditions for Hull\u2019s poor.</p> <p>Back then, deaths from building collapses were common and crime was rife, as exploitative landlords squeezed as many families into their unsanitary, unsafe properties as they could. With no running water or toilets, disease was commonplace. In 1849, Hull\u2019s great cholera epidemic killed 1,863 people \u2013 one in 43 of the population.<br></p> <p>In the first decades of the 20th century, Hull Corporation tried to get a grip on its housing crisis. But many of the new homes remained unaffordable to those who needed them most \u2013 and relocation was often traumatic. It was left up to the landlord to inform tenants of a demolition order \u2013 something they frequently failed to do. \u201cThe first many residents knew about it was when the council wrecking crew turned up on their doorsteps,\u201d Kerry-Green explains. </p> <p>But the slum clearances were nothing compared with the devastation wreaked by the Luftwaffe. With 1,200 people killed, 95% of houses damaged and 152,000 made homeless, Hull \u2013 the anonymous \u201cnorth-east coast town\u201d of the newsreels \u2013 was one of the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-humber-36212234\">most heavily bombed cities in Britain</a> between 1941 and 1945. Kerry-Green says the housing shortage was acute, and the fact the communities were so tight knit was both a strength and a weakness.</p> <p>\u201cWhen people got bombed out, a lot of them moved into relatives\u2019 houses. But when an area\u2019s that tightly packed, you\u2019re looking at maybe three or four families who are connected through kinship all bombed out at the same time. It makes it much more difficult for them to find somewhere to live.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"bf6c4b826929cc789187b0fa35cafa7ca4303791\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bf6c4b826929cc789187b0fa35cafa7ca4303791/0_0_5702_4416/1000.jpg\" alt=\"In 1974 these old properties near Argyle Street in Hull were due for demolition .\" width=\"1000\" height=\"774\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">In 1974, these old properties near Argyle Street in Hull were due for demolition .</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Local World/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It\u2019s easy to forget this. In a story about one man\u2019s \u201cwar\u201d with the council in the 1980s, those same streets had been an actual battleground 40 years earlier. The <a href=\"http://www.hull-peoples-memorial.co.uk/\">Hull People\u2019s Memorial</a> is a temporary museum in the city centre set up to raise funds for a permanent commemoration of civilians killed in the war. It has a comprehensive archive relating to Hull\u2019s Blitz, with a detailed breakdown of bombing raids by date and street. I find Kimberley Street, Jim Holmes\u2019s old stomping ground (direct hit: 8 May, 1941) and Argyle Street, targeted throughout the war.</p> <p>I make a further discovery when a casual inquiry about Nuttall prompts a bizarre exchange between two volunteers.</p> <p>\u201cYou knew him, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI thought he was your dad.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGet away!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut you knew of him?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMight\u2019ve done.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Every time one of them left the camp to try and get something, the police would stop them getting back in</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Once the issue of paternity is cleared up, I get an account of the siege I\u2019ve not heard before.</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019d set up the barricade on Wyndham Street pretty well and managed to keep the police out. Trouble was, <em>they</em> couldn\u2019t get out either. They had no water supply, no electricity. Every time one of them left the camp to try and get something, the police would stop them getting back in. In the end, the ones who were left must\u2019ve thought: \u2018Sod this.\u2019 And that\u2019s how it ended.\u201d </p> <p>I\u2019m astounded. I had always assumed Nuttall had surrendered because he\u2019d run out of money, or his family had persuaded him to give up. But if this version of the story is true, the siege was all too real \u2013 and the authorities didn\u2019t pull their punches. </p> <h2>The city\u2019s bones</h2> <p>Truth might be the first casualty of war, but nostalgia plays tricks on the memory too. Right now in Hull it\u2019s especially prevalent, which might have something to do with next year\u2019s City of Culture celebrations. Residents are being encouraged to \u201c<a href=\"https://untoldhull.org/\">tell their stories</a>\u201d, and tales of Blitz survival and post-war optimism provide respite from the modern news cycle of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/apr/24/police-launch-inquiry-after-bodies-of-two-men-found-in-hull\">crime and social breakdown</a>.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Hull city centre is being <a href=\"http://www.hulldailymail.co.uk/hull-city-centre-works-blamed-for-closure-of-holmes-comforts-cafe-in-carr-lane/story-29552640-detail/story.html\">prettified</a> in preparation for the TV cameras. Some of the city\u2019s derelict \u201ceye sores\u201d \u2013 the ones in strategic locations such as the New York Hotel, where Barry and Alyson had their wedding reception in 1983 \u2013 have been demolished. Exposing the city\u2019s bones \u2013 sometimes <a href=\"http://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/news/hundreds-of-skeletons-discovered-during-4-5m-church-upgrade-1-7842400\">literally</a> \u2013 to daylight has brought a yearning for what might have been. If the Luftwaffe had picked on somewhere else and left the great buildings and thoroughfares of our Victorian city intact, or the city council hadn\u2019t tried its damnedest to sweep away what was left.<br></p> <p>As in so many other things, Hull came late to building preservation, and even now concentrates its efforts around particular conservation areas and landmark buildings. Much of our architectural legacy exists only in \u201cfossil\u201d form \u2013 as the old walls around car parks or as burial grounds whose churches are long gone.</p> <p>Often only pictures remain, and it\u2019s little wonder that every fragment now seems <a href=\"http://www.hulldailymail.co.uk/13-crumbling-hull-buildings-saved/story-29268558-detail/story.html\">worthy of preservation</a>. A series of books, <a href=\"http://www.paul-gibson.com/about-me/books.php\">Hull \u2013 Then &amp; Now</a>, sums up this mood. Juxtaposing black and white photos of old Hull against modern shots of the same scenes, the message seems clear: we\u2019ll never get back what we\u2019ve lost. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d1e463e8fdb2753a36cc4a93bb69f109e2633204\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d1e463e8fdb2753a36cc4a93bb69f109e2633204/0_547_4716_2831/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A Hull resident casts her vote in the recent EU referendum; the city voted two-to-one in favour of Brexit.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Hull resident casts her vote in the recent EU referendum; the city voted two-to-one in favour of Brexit.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lindsey Parnaby/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I\u2019m susceptible to some of this nostalgia myself. When I started researching Nuttall\u2019s story, part of my motivation was to conjure up the vibrant neighbourhood he knew. I didn\u2019t know much about Spring Bank South \u2013 the area that had replaced it. But it had always seemed an anonymous place, built without regard to the character of the surrounding streets.</p> <p>It\u2019s the layout that confuses me. The houses are in rows, arranged on one side around driveways and on the other, landscaped grassy areas. It\u2019s not exactly clear where the front doors are, or how the streets link together.</p> <p>This is the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radburn_design_housing\">Radburn System</a> \u2013 an urban pattern beloved of council estate planners of the 1960s and 70s, and hated by postmen ever since. The idea was that by arranging houses in low density, semi-pedestrianised precincts, residents would be spared the noise and inconvenience of through traffic, and children could play safely away from the cars. </p> <p>Radburn is certainly doing its job: the noise of traffic on Londesborough and Argyle Streets has been reduced to a background rumble. I\u2019ve arranged to meet Frank McConnaghy at the community centre, a resident of the area for 40 years and treasurer of the local <a href=\"http://www.sbca.org.uk/\">Spring Bank Community Association</a>. </p> <p>When I speak to McConnaghy on the phone before our meeting, one thing crops up again and again: how much more \u201ccosmopolitan\u201d the area has become. By this he means racially diverse, and it is striking how many people out and about are of African, Asian, Middle Eastern and Eastern European origin.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The people who live in this area \u2013 one of the poorest in the country \u2013 just think: it can\u2019t get any worse for us</p> <footer> <cite>Frank McConnaghy</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Such an influx would have been unthinkable only 20 years ago, let alone when Nuttall lived here. Back then Spring Bank, like the rest of Hull, was predominantly white British. The wars in the Balkans and Middle East changed all that, bringing refugees \u201cdispersed\u201d from Manchester and London. In the 2000s, the freeing up of labour movement for new EU accession countries brought many more immigrants.</p> <p>\u201cAll the refugees just seem to have been dumped on this estate,\u201d McConnaghy says. \u201cOur neighbours are Poles, Indians and Turks. When the Home Office decided to take so many, there were families already here who were on the waiting list for houses.</p> <p>\u201cThe facilities are overloaded and the people who make the decisions aren\u2019t directly affected. That\u2019s why I voted Brexit.\u201d</p> <p>McConnaghy wasn\u2019t alone. <a href=\"http://www.hulldailymail.co.uk/eu-referendum-result-in-hull-overwhelmingly-backs-brexit/story-29439076-detail/story.html\">Hull voted two-to-one in favour of leaving the EU</a> in the June referendum, a shock that many didn\u2019t see coming in this Labour heartland. </p> <p>McConnaghy adds: \u201cThe people that live in this area \u2013 one of the poorest areas in the country, in terms of earnings \u2013 they just think: it can\u2019t get any worse for us. It\u2019s alright saying jobs\u2019ll go, but we haven\u2019t got any jobs in the first place. It\u2019s a massive protest vote.\u201d</p> <p>I see a connection between McConnaghy\u2019s opting for Brexit and Nuttall\u2019s protest. Both seem rooted in the impotence that comes from being ignored and pushed around for too long. But while he\u2019s clearly angry, McConnaghy \u2013 an affable 70 something \u2013 doesn\u2019t sound like a stereotypical Brexiteer. He has the utmost respect for Mohammed Younus, one of the centre\u2019s two managers. \u201cHe speaks seven languages,\u201d McConnaghy tells me \u2013 useful when trying to juggle the 23 different community groups of all nationalities and religious denominations that regularly use the centre.</p> <p>The event that brings everyone together is the annual international carnival. I ask McConnaghy what he thinks the Brexit vote will do for this carefully fostered community cohesion. Immigrants were subject to attacks and intimidation when they first turned up in large numbers in Hull in the 1990s. A <a href=\"http://www.hulldailymail.co.uk/patients-are-abusing-black-and-ethnic-minority-hull-hospital-staff/story-29565818-detail/story.html\">recent report in the Hull Daily Mail</a> suggests it might be happening again.</p> <p>McConnaghy shakes his head. \u201cWhen people say there have been racial tensions on Spring Bank, I\u2019ve got photos from the family fun day that\u2019ll show you Bosnians, Iraqi Kurds, local policemen ... The Kurds have got the bobbies\u2019 helmets on and they\u2019re all dancing round in a circle.\u201d </p> <p>I hope he\u2019s right. Seeing how McConnaghy and the other volunteers are solving the problems of life on the estate in all its messy, modern complexity might even cure me of my nostalgia. But I still want to have one last go at tracking down Barry Nuttall.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"6e7278920951fb9aafae419c7a06b04c9dfbcdd5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6e7278920951fb9aafae419c7a06b04c9dfbcdd5/0_0_5872_3524/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Barry Nuttall posing with an old army gun.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nuttall once worked as a garage mechanic, which is how he learned the knack of restoring his growing collection of old military vehicles.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hull Daily Mail/SWNS</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>While I was at the People\u2019s Memorial, someone suggested I go along to the <a href=\"http://www.hullcc.gov.uk/portal/page?_pageid=221,695573&amp;_dad=portal&amp;_schema=PORTAL\">Veterans\u2019 Weekend</a> taking place at East Park a couple of days later. The event flier promises living history displays and re-enactments from the two world wars, as well as British, German and American army camps. There\u2019s bound to be someone who knew Nuttall. If I\u2019m lucky I might even bump into one of his comrades from the Northern Allied Axis Society.</p> <p>Unfortunately, I didn\u2019t realise the scale of this event, or how popular it would be. East Park is Hull\u2019s biggest green space, and at least a third of it has been given over to displays, exhibits, stalls, fair rides and catering concessions for this annual event. I\u2019m immediately discombobulated by the confusion of sights and sounds. There\u2019s a bunch of Vikings setting up camp under some trees while \u201c<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3WPted_ihs\">Hang out the Washing on the Siegfried Line</a>\u201d floats out from a distant PA.</p> <p>I\u2019ve been told the living history displays would be a good place to start, so I wander around asking if anyone has heard of Nuttall. No one has, but I do find out something of what makes re-enactors tick. A Wild West dude, cooling his spurs, drawls about the ability to pose being \u201ca pre-requisite\u201d, and I think of Nuttall and his army, and all the press calls they did while they were in the media spotlight. But the Northern Allied Axis Society were about more than that. They were sticklers for rank and order.</p> <p>Is this common? \u201cOnly so far as you need it to put on an effective display,\u201d says David Robinson, of the 16th Lancers First World War Cavalry Display team. \u201cIf someone told me to get my hair cut because it looked wrong for the era, I\u2019d do it. You do it because you don\u2019t want to look crap.\u201d </p> <h2><strong>Oil and water</strong></h2> <p>The 30 years since the siege on Wyndham Street haven\u2019t been kind to Hull. As with other left-behind cities in the post-industrial north, the legacy of economic decline isn\u2019t only written in statistics for high unemployment or drug misuse, but also in the poor retention of its everyday architecture. <br></p> <p>But this isn\u2019t all the city council\u2019s fault. These days, it\u2019s far more likely to be developers who fail to maintain the old music halls or Methodist chapels in their possession, allowing arsonists and vandals to do their worst until <a href=\"http://www.hulldailymail.co.uk/bulldozers-bring-final-curtain-down-on-hull-s-albert-hall/story-29651897-detail/story.html\">demolition is the only option</a>.</p> <p>When I ask Brian Lavery whether he thinks the city has suffered from losing so much of its pre-war infrastructure, he says: \u201cHull\u2019s like oil and water: it always finds its level eventually.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/oct/30/hull-the-city-that-gentrification-forgot\">London 0, Hull plenty: how is life in England's only 'affordable city'?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Cycling home from East Park, I take a detour through an estate of well maintained brown brick council houses from the 1930s.

The effect in the ultra-vivid sunlight of a late summer afternoon is an amazing sense of space.</p> <p>These were new houses once, I think, but planned well, with an eye to the future. The trouble is, for too many modern developments here, short-term gain appears to be the only consideration. New houses are thrown up wherever developers can find a postage stamp of land to build them on; and they do it with scant regard for neighbourhoods\u2019 wider needs.</p> <p>Hull might always find its level but, without greater respect for the vital assets that make city life bearable, it won\u2019t be rising any higher. People need parks, shops, pubs, arts venues, safe roads and cycle paths to thrive \u2013 and, yes, a few old buildings to remind us where we\u2019ve come from.

This is a vindication of protest | Owen Jones</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The facts of the Apple case are straightforward: with the blessing of the Irish government, Apple created a byzantine network of subsidiaries to shelter its profits in an entity that was a tax resident of no country. As a result, billions of dollars of Apple\u2019s income have flowed almost tax free through Ireland\u2019s tax system. The European Commission estimates that in 2014, one of Apple\u2019s Irish affiliates paid a tax rate of just 0.005% on its Irish profits. </p> <p>The commission ruling sensibly finds that this arrangement violates the EU\u2019s \u201cstate aid\u201d rules, giving Apple an unfair competitive advantage, recognizes that Irish taxpayers are potentially not the only victim of Apple\u2019s tax avoidance and makes it clear that prompt action by US lawmakers could ensure that America sees its fair share of Apple\u2019s big tax bill. </p> <p>But therein lies the rub: while the financial cost of multinational corporations\u2019 offshore tax avoidance has long been clear (US-based Fortune 500 firms have <a href=\"http://ctj.org/ctjreports/2016/03/fortune_500_companies_hold_a_record_24_trillion_offshore.php#.V8gzYpMrJE5\">more than $2.4tn</a> parked offshore and are avoiding up to $695bn in US taxes), American lawmakers have demonstrated little appetite for enacting reforms needed to collect tax on this runaway cash. </p> <p>A current provision in the US tax law called \u201cdeferral\u201d enables allows companies to indefinitely avoid paying even a dime of US tax on offshore profits if they leave them offshore.</p> <p>These politicians understand that deferral means the US Treasury is missing a substantial amount of revenue that could be used to fund various public services. But for years, Congress and the Obama administration have failed to agree on legislation to compel US corporations to repatriate their offshore cash back to the United States. </p> <p>To entice companies to repatriate offshore profits, President Obama has <a href=\"http://ctj.org/ctjreports/2015/02/ten_corporations_would_save_82_billion_in_taxes_under_obamas_proposed_14_transition_tax.php#.V8gziJMrJE5\">proposed</a> a one-time tax on offshore cash at a reduced rate, and some Republicans have argued for a \u201ctax holiday\u201d that would allow Apple and other firms to repatriate their offshore profits at a rate as low as 5%.<br></p> <p>This rightly has been met with public outcry as it essentially rewards Apple and other offshoring companies with a sharply reduced tax rate on profits that should be taxed fully.</p> <p>Until US lawmakers agree to strengthen the nation\u2019s tax laws, tax-avoiding companies such as Apple will relentlessly seek out willing governmental partners \u2013 like Ireland \u2013 to hide their assets. And when they find these partners, the tax systems of every other nation in which they do business are the primary victims. </p> <p>The series of recent European Commission rulings culminating in this week\u2019s Apple decision have made it clear that European leaders recognize this and are set on stopping Irish and other politicians from subverting the tax systems of other European nations \u2013 and the United States. If US policymakers don\u2019t take a page from the EU\u2019s book and act promptly, the real victim of Apple\u2019s Irish tax dodge will be American taxpayers. </p>",

The family have since moved to Scotland.</p> <p>His wife, Barbara, said: \u201cHe continues to make progress but it is achingly slow. There are still small gains. Physically he\u2019s getting stronger. </p> <p>\u201cHis speech is very limited. Only now we are able to speak it\u2019s become apparent how great the damage was. He has no short-term memory so we have to live in the present. Mercifully, his sense of humour is still intact. </p> <p>\u201cThe police finally gave in on liability but now we are putting together the claim. A series of experts have come to assess Donald and his future needs. By the time it reaches court next June it will be more than seven years since the accident.\u201d</p>",

But they are reluctant to say so explicitly - because for a democrat to ignore the results of a popular vote is problematic, to put it mildly - and instead pro-Europeans are mostly focusing on demanding a second referendum.</p> <p>The former prime minister <strong>Tony Blair</strong> is as keen on staying in the EU as anyone and, in an interview with the French radio station Europe 1, he has explicitly said that Britain could stay in the EU. Public opinion could change, he argued. It is hard to think of any British pro-European politician who has been this explicit, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/27/brexit-is-not-inevitable-says-former-civil-service-chief\">although Lord O\u2019Donnell, the former cabinet secretary, has said something similar.</a></p> <p>You can read the Europe 1 account of the interview <a href=\"http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x4raxat_brexit-pour-tony-blair-le-debat-continue-et-un-maintien-dans-l-ue-reste-possible_news\">here.</a> And you can watch the video <a href=\"http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x4raxat_brexit-pour-tony-blair-le-debat-continue-et-un-maintien-dans-l-ue-reste-possible_news\">here</a> too. Blair conducted the interview in French. I\u2019ve taken the quotes from the Press Association account.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Blair said it was \u201cpossible\u201d that the UK could remain in the EU if public opinion shifted.</strong> This was not likely, he conceded. But he said there were several factors that might shift opinions, pointing to the fall in the value of sterling, damage to the financial services industry and car manufacturing and an expected reduction in foreign investment in the UK. Asked whether it was possible for opinion to shift enough to avoid Brexit he replied:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>At the moment, today, it is not probable, but the debate continues and I believe it is possible.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He rejected claims that Remain supporters simply had to accept the result of the referendum. </strong>The British people \u201chave the right\u201d to change their minds, he said.</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Who made a rule that we have to stop the debate now?</p> </blockquote> <p>He said Theresa May had to adopt the \u201cBrexit means Brexit\u201d position for the sake of Conservative party unity. But he went on:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>For the rest of us, we are free to have a debate.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He said at the moment there was \u201cconfusion\u201d as to what Brexit actually involved.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We have done something rather bizarre with Brexit. It\u2019s like moving house without having seen the new house. We have made an agreement to exchange, but we don\u2019t yet know the terms of Brexit, we don\u2019t know the costs and the consequences.</p> <p>There will come a moment when we have had the negotiations and we can see the terms we are being offered by the rest of Europe and we will be able to say that it is a good idea or perhaps that it is a bad idea with major consequences.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57c8261ee4b09a68e9b64c7d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-01T13:01:34.323Z\">2.01pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here is more from the Corbyn rally in Stoke.</p> <p>From the Telegraph\u2019s Michael Deacon</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/MichaelPDeacon/status/771312887222636544\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Corbyn rally in Stoke.

She has written <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/kerry-mccarthy/defra-badger-cull-pmqs_b_11705704.html?utm_hp_ref=uk\">a long article for Huffington Post</a> about the experience of serving in his shadow cabinet.</p> <p>It does not contain any shock, horror revelations. But McCarthy provides a string of anecdotes that call into question Corbyn\u2019s efficiency or competence, and collectively their impact is quite strong.</p> <p>Here are some of the key points.</p> <ul> <li><strong>McCarthy says Corbyn failed to show leadership in shadow cabinet.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>My concern steadily grew over what I was hearing from colleagues, such as Heidi, Thangam and Lilian, and what I was seeing at shadow cabinet meetings, where Jeremy tended to read from a prepared script, didn\u2019t respond to our questions, and didn\u2019t convey any sense of strategic direction or leadership.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>She says Corbyn could not admit that he backed big business.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Again at PLP, Emma Reynolds asked Jeremy if he \u201csupported big businesses like Jaguar Land Rover who employ thousands of people in my constituency\u201d. His answer was \u201cof course I\u2019m aware that big businesses exist and I\u2019m also aware that many of them don\u2019t pay their taxes\u201d. He simply couldn\u2019t bring himself to express support.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>She says that Corbyn had a \u201clack of grasp\u201d when it came to detail and sometimes said the wrong thing. </strong>She cites at least three examples. Here is one on badgers:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Jeremy also accused the government of \u201cgassing badgers\u201d. Months earlier I\u2019d asked him to reaffirm Labour\u2019s opposition to the cull when he got a chance, as people had, somewhat unfairly, been accusing him of going quiet on what he\u2019d said during the 2015 leadership campaign. We hadn\u2019t heard anything since, and were a little surprised to hear him bring it up during the EU campaign. The cull is actually about shooting badgers, not gassing them - gassing was outlawed in 1982 - so that was a bit of a \u2018head in hands\u2019 moment in my office, but no-one else seemed to notice.</p> </blockquote> <p>Here is another.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>At one PLP meeting Jeremy started talking about how vulnerable people \u201cwere being forced to borrow money from hedge funds\u201d. Angela Eagle and I caught each other\u2019s eye. Did he really not know the difference between loan sharks and hedge funds? </p> </blockquote> <p>But McCarthy seems particularly concerned by Corbyn\u2019s errors over Brexit.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Jeremy came in for a lot of criticism for saying on June 24th that Article 50 should be triggered \u201cnow\u201d. At the PLP hustings a few weeks later he showed he still hadn\u2019t got his head round the process, responding to a question from Meg Hillier by saying \u201cwe have two years in which to trigger Article 50\u201d. But the two years comes after Article 50 is triggered. It\u2019s how long we have before we actually have to leave the EU. That lack of grasp, when he\u2019d presumably been prepping for such a question, bothers me.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>She says that the shadow environment team had just one meeting with Corbyn in her nine months in the job. </strong>At the meeting she raised various issues, but Corbyn had just two requests; that she look at agricultural colleges and market gardens. Otherwise she was not given any \u201csteer\u201d as to what she should do, she says.</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>She says Corbyn\u2019s office did not consult her when they did intervene on environment issues.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>When the leader\u2019s office did venture into Defra territory, they didn\u2019t talk to the shadow team. We weren\u2019t consulted before Jeremy made his call for the pumps in Bridgwater, Somerset to be moved up to the flood-hit areas of the North, which he later had to backtrack on. And we weren\u2019t asked for our input before Jeremy led on air pollution at PMQs: an issue we\u2019d been doing a lot of work on, challenging government complacency and inaction in the context of the Client Earth court case and the Volkswagen scandal.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>She says Corbyn\u2019s office was disorganised.</strong> On one occasion she tried unsuccessfully for months to get Corbyn\u2019s office to commit to a visit that Corbyn said he wanted to make. She also spent months trying to set up a meeting with Corbyn with environmental groups. And in some cases it took months for letters to be passed on that needed a reply. </li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>His office was clearly under-staffed and in a bit of a muddle.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cb825ca2f3f2ebc7a972bcb5ed8d1126677dc813\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cb825ca2f3f2ebc7a972bcb5ed8d1126677dc813/94_77_5399_3240/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kerry McCarthy.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kerry McCarthy.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dinendra Haria/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-09-01T12:16:39.845Z\">at 1.16pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57c80db5e4b06b4ac17488f3\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-01T11:33:25.207Z\">12.33pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Working-class applicants 'missing out on City jobs because of dress code'</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The<strong> social mobility commission</strong> has published<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/549387/Socio-economic_diversity_in_life_sciences_and_investment_banking.pdf\"> a report (pdf)</a> today saying young people who do not come from privileged backgrounds are being excluded from City jobs because they don\u2019t conform.

But Labour was defeated, Balls lost his seat, and today his principal contribution to national life is as a contestant on Strictly. Still, on a relatively quiet day, he\u2019s worth a mention on the Politics Live blog. He has got a memoir to plug, and extracts have already appeared in the Times. He had more to say this morning in an interview with Nick Robinson on the Today programme. Here are the key points. </p> <ul> <li><strong>Balls said it was a \u201cdelusion\u201d to think that Labour lost the 2015 general election because it was not leftwing enough.</strong> Jeremy Corbyn and his supporters have consistently argued that Labour lost because it was not radical enough. But Balls described this as \u201cnonsense\u201d.</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I\u2019m afraid it\u2019s a great delusion, in a constituency like mine, to think that people who voted Liberal Democrat in 2010 and went to the Conservatives in 2015 did so because they thought Labour was not radical enough. In the end it was a matter of trust on the economy, and whether we would spend the money wisely ... The idea [Labour lost] because we weren\u2019t leftwing enough I\u2019m afraid is just a nonsense.</p> </blockquote> <p>He was also asked to explain <a href=\"http://labourlist.org/2016/08/ed-balls-brandishes-corbyns-labour-a-leftist-utopian-fantasy/\">the claim in his memoir, Speaking Out, that Corbyn indulges in \u201cleftist utopian fantasy\u201d.</a> Balls told Today\u201d</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I was making a broader point than just about Jeremy. I was talking about what we are seeing in America in Bernie Sanders, and with Donald Trump - an issue of left and right - and saying it is a complex, difficult world, in which populations are angry, incomes have not risen, people are worried about identity, the globalisation of labour, and there is a tendency for some to peddle a simple solution and say \u2018We can just solve the problem, it\u2019s all the fault of the bankers, or immigrants, or a neoliberal conspiracy, or welfare scroungers\u2019. And I don\u2019t think that\u2019s enough.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>Balls said it would be \u201cdisastrous\u201d for Labour MPs opposed to Corbyn to form an independent group in the House of Commons if Corbyn is re-elected leader.</strong> Some MPs have reportedly being considering this option, as an alternative to setting up a completely new party. But Balls said that would be a \u201cterrible thing to do\u201d. </li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>My advice would be that would be a disastrous thing to do. I think one of the messages of my book is that to walk away from challenges is a mistake. </p> </blockquote> <p>Setting up a separate group in the Commons would be a particular mistake because Labour could be facing an early election, he said.</p> <ul> <li><strong>He suggested that his relationship with Ed Miliband during the 2015 general election was even worse than Tony Blair\u2019s famously dysfunctional relationship with Gordon Brown.</strong> In his book,<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/29/ed-balls-labour-did-not-deserve-to-win-election-ed-miliband\"> as the extracts published already have revealed, </a>Balls says he only spoke to Miliband about twice during the election campaign. Asked about this he told Today:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I would have preferred it if it had been more. I would rather have been on the inside of that strategy ... In the era of Brown and Blair, even when their relationship had become difficult, when it came to elections, everybody came together and they were speaking once, more than once, a day. That was not the case in our election campaign.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He said it was \u201cpretty unlikely\u201d that he would return to politics - but he did not rule it out.</strong> He also said it was a mistake for MPs who lost their seats to try to come \u201cstraight back\u201d - implying that returning to the Commons after a break would be much wiser. When asked about his future, he said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There are lots of politicians who lose and try and come straight back. But that\u2019s not what I\u2019ve decided to do .... I\u2019m having a good time. We\u2019ll see what happens in the future. But back to politics? I think it\u2019s pretty unlikely. </p> </blockquote> <p>Otherwise it is relatively quiet today. Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary, is in Germany for a meeting of Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) foreign ministers. And Corbyn is holding a rally in Stoke at 1pm.</p> <p>As usual, I will be covering the breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web. I will post a summary at lunchtime but may wrap up early after that.</p> <p>If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AndrewSparrow\">@AndrewSparrow.</a></p> <p>I try to monitor the comments BTL but normally I find it impossible to read them all.

  "<h2>Yours sincerely, wasting away</h2> <p>What is Stage 2? A new development of luxury apartments built on the site of the Washington Plant and ideal for a young family? The level you access only after you\u2019ve beaten the big bad of E Corp in hand-to-hand combat? A situation that only occurs once a disease has truly suppressed the immune system?</p> <p>Whatever it is, Stage 2 is Elliot\u2019s idea. We know this because he hacked the phone of Xun, a Dark Army lieutenant, who told us as much. Darlene was monitoring the calls, and so became the first to know. This puts her in a sticky position, not just because her brother might be working in the interests of the Chinese government, but also because she beat her lover up with a baseball bat thinking it was he who knew all about Stage 2.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cbae6558a04a95facc93bf80aea7543131e7be54\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cbae6558a04a95facc93bf80aea7543131e7be54/59_0_1212_727/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Elliot\u2019s Dissociative Identity Disorder has got to the point where nothing makes sense any more.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Elliot\u2019s Dissociative Identity Disorder has got to the point where nothing makes sense any more.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: USA Network</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Elliot, for his part, would seem unlikely to be as surprised as his sister by the news. Not because he remembers what Stage 2 is \u2013 he does not \u2013 but because his Dissociative Identity Disorder has deteriorated to the point where very little makes sense any more. This week, Elliot has three out-of-body experiences, where he watches himself \u2013 as Mr Robot \u2013 from a distance. Also, and just as unusually, he actually shouts at someone (Xun, when he meets him in person). As Elliot consciously tries to take on more qualities of Mr Robot \u2013 assertiveness, determination \u2013 \u201cElliot\u201d is being subconsciously pushed to one side. And yet \u2026 his encounter with his mother, where he asserted himself upon a mute party, suggested a non-chaotic alternative for our hero. He used an idea of his mother to keep himself sane in prison. Maybe he will gird himself again in battles to come.</p> <p>[As a sidenote, I enjoyed the introductory sequence of Elliot\u2019s prison compadres in their actual environment. As suspected, Ray was the governor.]</p> <h2>Will you still need me, will you still feed me \u2026</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4784e53a98f805eb6a32b34c82e67d3679dfa15f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4784e53a98f805eb6a32b34c82e67d3679dfa15f/0_0_1215_729/1000.jpg\" alt=\"That darned dog!

Elliot in the prison yard.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: USA Network</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Several plot twists this week. We know why Elliot went to prison (that darned dog!). We know that Mrs Wellick has worked out who Elliot is. Dom DiPierro, meanwhile, could turn out to be Angela\u2019s best ally, while there\u2019s something going on in Sharon Knowles\u2019s apartment. But for all the plotting, the psychology of the characters remains the most compelling aspect of this excellent drama.</p> <p>Elliot\u2019s may be the most complex, but watching Phillip Price at work is always gripping. The CEO of Evil Corp is the greatest villain in Mr Robot, mainly because we don\u2019t know the depths to which he is prepared to sink. This week he faces off against Whiterose, his main rival in perfidy. Rose, who is both queen hacker and Chinese minister of state, reveals that she killed the last CEO of Evil Corp (and then, for effect, actually pisses on his grave). Such behaviour doesn\u2019t cut much ice with Price. \u201cI\u2019m a mercenary,\u201d he informs Whiterose. \u201cI do what I want. Order will not protect you any more, I will rain chaos, even if it hurts me. Because I would rather see you lose than win myself.\u201d That\u2019s some baddie talk right there.</p> <p>It\u2019s a standoff. Price needs a bailout to refloat Evil Corp, while Whiterose can\u2019t afford for the Washington Plant to close. Price asks Whiterose to get the Chinese government to step in, which may be humiliating for him. That said, his position is not as sticky as his opponent, who may threaten all he likes but can\u2019t afford to see Evil Corp go bust.</p> <p>Unless I\u2019ve missed a vital scene (it has been known), we have no idea what the pair\u2019s ultimate motives are. Price, after all, appears to be complicit in the hack that brought his company low in the first place. What Whiterose wants with all that leaky nuclear material is unclear too (though maybe one could have a guess at something military). I suspect we will learn more next week.</p> <h2>Indicate precisely what you mean to say</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0b862b9c5bab5f9340c1dde2b0f9a1961994d486\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0b862b9c5bab5f9340c1dde2b0f9a1961994d486/171_0_1148_689/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A quick learner on e-sabotage \u2026 Angela.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A quick learner of e-sabotage \u2026 Angela.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: USA Network</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Angela turns out to have been a quick learner when it comes to electronic sabotage. She used her rubber ducky again, this time to hack into Evil Corp and get all the files on the Washington Plant. She wasn\u2019t even nearly caught this time neither, as the one old doofus to stumble upon her couldn\u2019t tell one woman from another and mistook Angela for a secretary.</p> <p>Far less sophisticated was her subsequent willingness to share what she\u2019d found with a federal body, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Surely if there\u2019s one thing she\u2019s learned from her time inside a massive conspiracy, it\u2019s that it\u2019s best to trust no one. Anyway, she may have to trust again after Dom played her hand. She knows a lot of what Angela has been up to, and suspects the rest, but she knows not to trust her superiors after the Chinese shootout and so might be able to offer Angela the kind of arrangement she needs. As she says to her: \u201cYou\u2019ve got one hand left to play and it\u2019s me.\u201d</p> <h2>Order v chaos rating: 8</h2> <p>So Big Phil declared war on order (thus subscribing to Elliot\u2019s \u201ccontrol is an illusion\u201d mantra). But a more visible assault on everyday life is the arrival of electricity \u201cbrownouts\u201d. With the economy floundering, electricity providers are struggling to generate enough power to meet demand. As a result everyone\u2019s lighting is dipping to a moody shade of \u201ccyber yellow\u201d (yes, that\u2019s a real thing). Also, credit cards don\u2019t work any more. And if that isn\u2019t anarchy I don\u2019t know what is.</p> <h2>Self-assault index</h2> <p>Well the two aspects of Elliot\u2019s personality are being pulled apart rather than pushed together. But this may yet may be more destructive. After all, had Mr Robot not been on the other side of the video signal at a closed circuit court hearing, Elliot might not have gone to prison in the first place.</p> <h2>Questions</h2> <p>You know, what is Stage 2? Why did the Chinese shootout affect the bail-out? What\u2019s in Susan Jacobs\u2019s apartment? And where is Tyrell Wellick?</p>",

Police said in a statement that they used \u201cnon-lethal force\u201d because the mother and her son repeatedly failed \u201cto comply with lawful commands\u201d. </p> <p>A spokesman said that police entered the house only after repeatedly attempting to make contact, then hearing yelling and a cry of \u201ccall 911!\u201d from inside, prompting concern for the residents\u2019 safety, especially given that the truck they had chased was not registered at that address.</p> <p>\u201cWe can\u2019t ignore the fact that there was wrong on both sides,\u201d said Derrick Reed, a former local NAACP president and current city councilman for the ward where the incident took place.

  "<p>Graduates with first-class degrees from elite universities are being \u201clocked out\u201d from jobs in investment banking if they commit the crime of wearing brown shoes, look uncomfortable in a suit, or have the wrong \u201cpolish\u201d or \u201caura\u201d, according to a new study into social exclusion.<br></p> <p>The exclusion process is even more brutal for non-privileged candidates from non-elite universities and schools, found <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/socio-economic-diversity-in-life-sciences-and-investment-banking\">the report by the Social Mobility Commission</a>, which uncovers a world where, according to one interviewee: \u201cThere are some areas in the bank \u2026 where the concept of diversity is about taking a different year group from Eton or from Harrow; if some of the departments are really ambitious they might include St Paul\u2019s and Westminster school.\u201d</p> <p> In its report, Socio-Economic Diversity in Life Sciences and Investment Banking, published on Thursday, the commission, chaired by former minister Alan Milburn, reveals that the mainstream recruitment and selection processes of investment banks has \u201cset up barriers for individuals from non-privileged backgrounds\u201d. </p> <p> By \u201cnon-privileged\u201d, however, the report aims high, by defining \u201cprivilege\u201d as having rich and important parents who could be useful to the banks, going to a select few private schools \u2013 and an even more select few universities \u2013 having completed three or four periods of unpaid work experience by the age of 17, and social skills honed by attending drinks and dinner parties from an early age with their parents.</p> <p> \u201cIt is important to note again that these processes are becoming more pronounced within the sector,\u201d noted the report. \u201cBanks acting alone may be reluctant to reverse this trend for fear of their competitors capturing all the \u2018best\u2019 candidates at an early stage.\u201d</p> <p> Preparing for a successful career in banking starts early, the report found. Candidates for front-office roles in banks must have scored 520 points in the old A-level tariff, equivalent to two A* and two As. </p> <p> \u201cStudents who achieve strong grades at a target university but have performed less well at school, may be automatically eliminated during rigid pre-screening,\u201d the report notes. Applications from these students will not even be read by banks, even if the student is on track for a first-class degree. </p> <p> While achieving these A-level results, students must also be able to show a variety and often extensive list of extracurricular activities on their CV, including leading societies and sporting clubs. </p> <p> From school, candidates must attend the very narrow group of universities in the UK from which investment banks prefer to select, including London School of Economics (LSE), University College London (UCL), Imperial College London, and Oxford, Cambridge and Warwick Universities.</p> <p> Just 7% of all UK children attend fee-paying schools but 34% of new entrants to the banking sector who were educated in the UK had attended a fee-paying school, rising to almost 70% of new entrants in private equity. More than 50% of current leaders within the banking sector who are from the UK were educated privately.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/26/fixing-wealth-inequality-future-generations-will-think-us-mad-and-they-will-be-right\">Fixing wealth inequality: future generations will think us mad, and they will be right | Wayne Swan</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Oxbridge entrants to the City are more likely to be privately educated than Oxbridge graduates who go elsewhere: 42% of all Oxbridge graduates went to private schools but 65% of Oxbridge entrants to the banking sector went to private school. </p> <p>During their time at the university, aspiring bankers are expected to continue expanding their CVs with extracurricular activities. These requirements have, the report says, \u201carguably contributed to a relative \u2018arms race\u2019 as, faced with increasing competition and an ever increasing need to stand out, aspirant bankers engage in increasingly focused efforts to build their CV\u201d. </p> <p>The report says that \u201cin other careers, university might provide the environment in which students from non-privileged backgrounds can identify and refine their career aspirations, ready to apply to internships during their second year. Yet for investment banks, students from non-privileged backgrounds who apply at this point may be competing against others who have already added several internships, Spring Week programmes, and/or insight days to their CV.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cb619d38cb45a7bf101f0aab9914d4e59228a306\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cb619d38cb45a7bf101f0aab9914d4e59228a306/0_186_3700_2221/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Eton public school boys.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Eton College pupils.

They do two, or three, or four\u201d This requirement is becoming more pronounced.</p> <p>But these periods of work experience and internships, which may lead to permanent jobs, are frequently offered to individuals whose friends and family are of strategic importance to the bank, including in relation to the expansion of their business on a global basis. </p> <p>One interviewee said: \u201cIt\u2019s not nepotism the way we actually think about it. It\u2019s actually very calculated, profit-motivated, rational thinking.\u201d </p> <p>Internships, however, are not for learning the ropes: they are for climbing into already formed networks. \u201cIt is possible to build networks during internships [but] existing social networks may also play a role as interns seek to build internal networks within the bank and secure all-important \u2018face-time\u2019 with influential senior bankers \u2026 [while] impress[ing] a sufficient number [of current traders] who would act as referees for a permanent position,\u201d the report says.</p> <p>Even for candidates who get this far, there is another hurdle to scale: that of \u201ccomportment\u201d. This, the report notes, are opaque modes of speech, accent, dress and behaviour which are \u201cactively sought by hiring managers during the selection process\u201d and which, a senior member of the profession revealed, are best learned alongside one\u2019s parents while at school, at dinner and drinks parties. </p> <p>These attributes, the report adds, are undefinable \u2013 and therefore, unachieveable for the non-privileged \u2013 but can be described as a \u201cpolish\u201d or \u201can aura\u201d. Not having that \u201caura\u201d can be exposed, said one interviewee, by a candidate simply \u201cnot saying much or if they do say it, they\u2019re not quite saying it the right way\u201d. Another interviewee added: \u201cPeople without this polish will be just be crushed underfoot.\u201d</p> <p> These opaque codes of conduct also extend to dress. For men, the report found, wearing brown shoes with a business suit is generally considered unacceptable. Unless you come from continental Europe. </p> <p>\u201cInterviewees suggested that [these issues] do play a material role in the selection process, once again, as a demonstration of [a candidate\u2019s] \u2018fit\u2019 [inside the bank],\u201d said the report. </p> <p>One interviewee said it was easy to spot candidates from non-privileged backgrounds: \u201cFrom my experience [they] \u2026 don\u2019t have a haircut \u2026 their suit\u2019s always too big \u2026 they don\u2019t know which tie to wear,\u201d they said. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c1b5301c37060d5394a3da709405692a9c105f2c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c1b5301c37060d5394a3da709405692a9c105f2c/0_0_1152_691/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Shirt and black tie (or blue tie)\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The wrong tie could put off potential employers, according to one interviewee.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Roger Tooth/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Another interviewee, from a non-privileged background, described feedback he received from a mentor after an interview: \u201cHe said: \u2018You interviewed really well.\u2019 He said: \u2018You\u2019re clearly quite sharp, but \u2026 you\u2019re not quite the fit for [this bank] \u2026 you\u2019re not polished enough\u2019 \u2026 he looked at me and said: \u2019See that tie you\u2019re wearing?

  "<p>Nobody will accuse me of being lax on state aid enforcement. In 2008, when European Union member states were about to embark on a subsidy race to bail out banks hit by the financial crisis, I stated that state aid rules are part of the solution, not the problem. And while many disagreed with the application of state aid rules to bailouts, I advocated the enforcement of tough restructuring obligations for state-aided banks.</p> <p>However, state aid is not a cure for all ills. Today, there is a broad sentiment that multinational companies do not pay enough taxes, that they are using mismatches between national tax laws to lower their tax burden.<br></p> <p>State aid is not suited to deal with such mismatches. It is a tool to address instances where a member state has made an exception to its own rules and given a specific company an advantage. To know whether that is the case, one has to understand how corporate taxation works.</p> <p>International corporate tax principles dictate that companies pay taxes where value is created. In the modern world, companies create value through design, marketing and intellectual creativity. It is where those activities take place that the profits really originate.</p> <p>It is therefore no surprise that US companies with research and development and intellectual property developed in the US will pay most of their taxes there, and not where the products are made or sold. Of course, the same principles apply to innovative design-focused European companies that sell their products abroad.</p> <p>EU member states have a sovereign right to determine their own tax laws. State aid cannot be used to rewrite those rules. However, the current state aid investigations into tax rulings appear to do exactly that, by suggesting a radical new approach to so-called transfer-pricing rules that determine where profits shall be allocated. By doing so, the commission risks undermining the important work carried out within the Organisation for Economic Co\u2011operation and Development (OECD) through its \u201cBase Erosion and Profit Shifting\u201d (BEPS) project.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/video/2016/aug/30/why-apple-is-facing-13bn-tax-bill-in-ireland-video-explainer\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/5xjmj\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2691352\"            data-video-name=\"Why Apple is facing a \u20ac13bn tax bill in Ireland \u2013 video explainer\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57c5a5a9e4b04fe839bc4fcd\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/08/31/160830applexplainerUPDATE_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/08/31/160830applexplainerUPDATE.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/08/31/160830applexplainerUPDATE_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/video/2016/aug/30/why-apple-is-facing-13bn-tax-bill-in-ireland-video-explainer\">Why Apple is facing a \u20ac13bn tax bill in Ireland</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>The US government has expressed concerns about this approach warning that it expands the commission\u2019s role \u201cbeyond enforcement of competition and State aid law under the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) into that of a supra-national tax authority\u201d.</p> <p>We all agree on the need to tackle tax avoidance, but such reform should come from a transparent legislative process within the EU and through consensus building in international fora, such as the OECD. Once the new rules are in place, they can be applied to every taxpayer.</p> <p>But you cannot change the rules of the game through ad hoc state aid enforcement, and then seek retroactive recovery for unpaid taxes. Doing so would be fundamentally unfair and would harm competition, growth and tax income in Europe. And it raises serious questions about legal certainty and the rule of law.</p> <p>Anyone who has filled out a tax return knows that tax rules can be complex. This is even more so for companies operating in multiple jurisdictions. Tax authorities issue tax rulings, or advance opinions, in order to explain how local tax rules will be applied in individual cases, and companies rely on these to take investment decisions. But if such rulings can now be second-guessed by Brussels years or even decades later, that value is lost.</p> <p>It is a fundamental principle of tax law that changes will not apply retroactively. Companies (as individuals) should know what their fiscal obligations are up front and should be able to plan with them. When tax rules change, they do so for the future only and there are strict limits to the re-opening of tax assessments for the past.</p> <p>With the application of state aid rules, this changes, as the commission may order the recovery of any state aid deemed illegal for 10 years into the past. This could happen in a situation in which neither the company nor the member state have violated any tax rules nor had reason to believe that the tax assessment was illegal. I have taken note of the commission\u2019s commitment to focus its enforcement only on \u201coutliers\u201d, but I assume nobody can determine what those are. The de minimis threshold in state aid is relatively low and there is no definition of \u201coutlier cases\u201d.</p> <p>Benjamin Franklin is thought to have stated that nothing in this world is certain, except death and taxes. But these recent state aid investigations have introduced uncertainty about corporate taxation.</p> <p>Rather than pursuing a handful of countries and companies for the past, we should focus on shaping a fair tax system for the future. The controversy about state aid and tax rulings is not about whether companies pay their fair share, but where that share should be paid. That is an important question, but not one for state aid.</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/NeelieKroesEU\">Neelie Kroes</a> was the European Union\u2019s commissioner for competition from 2004 to 2010, and commissioner for digital agenda from 2010 to 2014.

The best that can be hoped for is retaining access to the Single Market with concessions on immigration (an emergency brake of sorts, even though I\u2019m pro-immigration, I believe this is non-negotiable). This will avoid having to negotiate endless trade deals or uplift many EU Regulations into UK law. Any alternative will mean years of complex, fraught negotiations with countries uninterested in giving us a good deal, while our labour market collapses from the loss of EU workers (NHS will be worst hit) and we bicker over our stagnating economy. It\u2019ll be like this for 10-15 years. </p> <p>What do I think will happen? Arguments, lobbying, and disappointment all round. We can\u2019t retain access to the Single Market without free movement of labour. We can\u2019t hope to avoid a shock to the economy without it. We (apparently) voted for Brexit to \u2018solve\u2019 immigration (no mention of outside-EU workers, already under a points system, funnily enough) so that\u2019s also a non-negotiable. So there will be an impasse, likely ploughed through by civil servants and a Tory government being lobbied from all angles. I expect concessions for the city or the Square Mile will be hit hard - and however much we want its influence to ebb, it\u2019s 20% of our GDP and a huge tax slice - and immigration to be central, so we\u2019ll be having to negotiate costly trade deals that aren\u2019t Canada plus, or Norway-lite, or anything. And these negotiations will be going on after May\u2019s long gone. I expect we\u2019ll not really know what Brexit looks like until at least 2025. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57c81e39e4b09a68e9b64c65\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/james-walsh\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-01T12:33:24.899Z\">1.33pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here is a selection of comments from the debate below the line.

Every time I look to research into a new bit of British life to see what the implications are, my mind starts to boggle. Take passports, for example. It seems like bringing back a navy blue passport will be a PR win for Theresa May, would please a lot of Leave voters, and be a real symbol of \u201ctaking back control\u201d. </p> <p>So, first of all you\u2019ve got to make sure that the rest of the EU and the rest of the world will continue to accept UK passports issued with the European Union design and name on them after the actual day of Brexit. I can\u2019t imagine they would be refused, but you\u2019d probably need to explicitly clarify they would still be valid. There will be people whose passports expire a few days before the date of Brexit who will need to renew them for travel in that period, so you also have to decide whether you are going to continue issuing passports in the EU design that expire in 10 years, or whether you gradually taper this down. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1535ff5da670b414cb0e002f91849508866e8dbe\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1535ff5da670b414cb0e002f91849508866e8dbe/0_117_3588_2152/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Passports: a sticking point?\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Passports: a sticking point?</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Niklas Halle'N/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>If you\u2019ve got 10 year EU-style passports being issued that means you have to commit to all the equipment at our borders still being able to read the data on those passports for at least a decade. That probably means whatever you do about the new passport design, the chips etc have got to be compatible with the existing equipment. So even though we\u2019ve taken back control, we\u2019d still have to adhere to the EU data standard. You can anticipate that there will be a rush of people wanting to replace their passports early, so before you start issuing them you need to have stockpiled enough of the new design and make sure there isn\u2019t going to be a huge overwhelming backlog of applications. </p> <p>None of this is insurmountable, it is quite clearly possible to switch from one set of passport designs to a different set on a specific day, because we did it in reverse. But, what you\u2019ve got to do is synchronise this change with all the other changes you are making. And you\u2019ve got to find the civil service and ministerial time for it, with a civil service that has been reduced in size over the last six years. Possibly it would require some legislation which might take up a bit of parliamentary time. And it is the least of your worries, but you probably also have to remember to change all the signs at every single border crossing. And changing passports is just ONE element in the whole of Brexit. It\u2019s all achievable, but I genuinely expect to be reporting on the process of Brexit for the next five years.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-09-01T12:16:36.266Z\">at 1.16pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57c81578e4b06b4ac1748929\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/james-walsh\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-01T12:13:46.381Z\">1.13pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>We\u2019ve been hearing from Remain voters frustrated at what they see as the incoherence of the Leave campaigners, and their inability to decide what Brexit means - and the implications that this will have for the Brexit negotiations.<br></p> <p>\u201cIt seems inevitable that it will be driven by political manoeuvring rather than the national interest,\u201d says David Ward, and NHS Manager in Norfolk.</p> <p> \u201cWhatever shores up the PM\u2019s position within the party and wins votes will be the favoured option.

Theresa May cannot back out of invoking Article 50 (Brexit means Brexit). But she knows what a nightmare it will be. So how is she going to deal with a situation she doesn't want?</p> <p>The referendum was only 'advisory' and so it has to go through parliament. <i>The one who decided the referendum was only advisory was Philip Hammond, who is now her chancellor.</i> The majority of MPs are pro-EU (about 450). She knows (as do many Tory MPs) it will not pass through parliament. So she has to make it look like she is doing her utmost, otherwise she will have riots and rebellions on her hands.</p></div> </div> </div>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57c80907e4b09a68e9b64be7\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/jonhenley\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-01T11:11:26.785Z\">12.11pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">I doubt Britain will get a 'have your cake a eat it' deal</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>It is now clear from the announcement after yesterday\u2019s cabinet meeting that the government wants a bespoke Brexit deal with the EU \u2013 rather than an existing model such as Norway\u2019s \u2013 that will give it control over EU immigration while at the same time favouring trade in goods and services (which essentially means single market access, particularly for financial services).</p> <p>Unfortunately, it is very hard to see what would induce the EU and its 27 remaining member states to agree to such an arrangement. The newer members will not easily surrender on freedom of movement. The older ones, with Eurosceptic parties challenging hard on immigration in elections next year, simply cannot afford to give Britain a \u201chave your cake and eat it\u201d deal.</p> <p>If there is one clear message to have come from every European capital in the past two months, it is that single market membership comes at a price, and part of that price is accepting freedom of movement. This is not a question of \u201cpunishing\u201d Britain, but of domestic political imperatives and the future survival of the EU. There can be no cherry-picking, as several leaders have said.</p> <p>So this will be a difficult circle for the prime minister to square, particularly since Britain does not start from a particularly strong negotiating position: if the UK-EU trade relationship were to revert to standard WTO terms, both the European and the British economies would be damaged \u2013 but Britain\u2019s would, undeniably, take the relatively bigger hit. <br></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57c80b11e4b09a68e9b64bfa\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/james-walsh\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-01T11:06:06.588Z\">12.06pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">How to contribute</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Want to join our debate but lacking in a Guardian commenting account?

  "<p>The internationally known imprisoned former Black Panther and journalist Mumia Abu-Jamal has had his request for a life-saving hepatitis C treatment denied by a federal judge.</p> <p>Abu-Jamal was sentenced to death for the 1981 killing of a Philadelphia police officer, but maintained his innocence and Amnesty International says he was denied a fair trial. After 30 years on death row, his sentence was overturned on constitutional grounds. He is now serving life without parole, and his supporters have shifted their focus to his access to medical care. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/dec/07/abu-jamal-death-penalty-pennsylvania-black-panthers\">Former Black Panther spared death chamber as prosecutors admit defeat</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Abu-Jamal sued the state of Pennsylvania to receive anti-viral medication for hepatitis C after he was hospitalized in critical condition last year. Officials told him he was not sick enough to be eligible for the treatment, which has a 90-95% cure rate but costs $1,000 per dose, and is taken once a day for 12 weeks. </p> <p>On Wednesday US district court judge Robert Mariani said Abu-Jamal\u2019s lawsuit wrongly targeted the warden and the prison system\u2019s medical chief, and should have named the four members of the state\u2019s hepatitis C committee instead. Abu-Jamal\u2019s lawyers say the committee did not exist at the time the lawsuit was filed.</p> <p> One of the members was later added as a defendant: Dr Paul Noel, chief of clinical services for the state\u2019s department of corrections. The judge cited his testimony that the state\u2019s protocol is designed \u201cto identify those with the most serious liver disease and to treat them first, and then \u2026 move down the list to the lower priorities\u201d.</p> <p>He said prisoners with esophageal varices, or enlarged veins in the throat that have begun to bleed would \u201cmove on to immediate treatment, and if they don\u2019t have varices, they can wait\u201d.</p> <p>In court filings, a lawyer for the Pennsylvania\u2019s prison system wrote \u201cthere simply is not enough money to treat every individual\u201d with chronic hepatitis C and that treating all of them \u201cwould cost approximately $600m. Such an expense would effectively cripple the department\u201d.</p> <p>Even as the judge denied Abu-Jamal\u2019s request he still found that the evidence and testimony presented in the case demonstrate that Pennsylvania\u2019s hepatitis C protocol for inmates fails to meet constitutional standards. </p> <p>Newly obtained evidence in Abu-Jamal\u2019s case revealed that Pennsylvania treats just about five of more than 6,000 prisoners who are infected with hepatitis C. The details will probably be used in an unrelated class action lawsuit filed by other Pennsylvania prisoners seeking similar treatment for the disease.</p> <p>Hundreds who have been moved to the prison infirmaries are \u201cdying in isolation, often chained to their beds\u201d says Noelle Hanrahan, a supporter of Abu-Jamal who monitors prison conditions and records his commentaries for Prison Radio.</p> <p>According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, hepatitis C has infected three million people in the United States, including more than 700,000 in prison nationwide. </p> <p>Other states have responded to the health crisis differently. In the last two years New York increased spending on drugs for prisoners infected with the disease by more than 350%. California is also treating prisoners with hepatitis C on a large scale. </p> <p>Judge Mariani wrote that Pennsylvania\u2019s \u201ctreatment protocol as currently adopted and implemented \u2026 prolongs the suffering of those who have been diagnosed with chronic hepatitis C\u201d. He added that it \u201callows the progression of the disease to accelerate so that it presents a greater threat\u201d of related liver disease, cancer and death. </p> <p>Abu-Jamal\u2019s lawyers called the decision a partial setback.</p> <p>\u201cWe are frustrated he won\u2019t get the treatment that the rest of the judge\u2019s opinion makes clear he is entitled to,\u201d said Bret Grote of the Abolitionist Law Center. \u201cBut the judge\u2019s ruling makes clear that if what he considers the proper defendants were in front of him, he was prepared to strike down the protocol and order that my client be treated in accord with proper medical standards.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>South Africa\u2019s leading opera house has been accused of financially exploiting 12 singers who performed internationally in a controversial but critically acclaimed production of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/aug/26/cosi-fan-tutte-review-edinburgh-festival-theatre-mozart-cape-town-opera\">Mozart\u2019s Cos\u00ec Fan Tutte</a>, set in colonial north Africa and portraying racial abuse and rape by fascist Italian troops.</p> <p>The 12 black chorus members of the Cape Town Opera (CTO) were put on standard South African monthly pay rates of between 6,000 and 11,000 rand (\u00a3316-\u00a3580) for seven weeks of rehearsals and a heavy programme of performances in Aix-en-Provence, France, before Cos\u00ec Fan Tutte transferred last week to Edinburgh.</p> <p>But they then discovered they had been contracted by the Aix festival, which runs for three weeks, to appear for \u20ac3,640 (\u00a33,000) each and complained. They accused Michael Williams, managing director of the CTO, of misleading them about the French employment contracts they had to sign to give them the legal right to work at Aix. </p> <p>With the chorus members threatening to strike at one stage in the dispute, executives at Edinburgh and Aix intervened and gave all 12 singers individual contracts, in effect removing CTO from the events. <br></p> <p>The Edinburgh festival gave them a \u00a3500 appearance fee plus \u00a330 a day and flights, visas and accommodation for three performances which ended on Sunday night, played to near-capacity audiences. <br></p> <p>As a direct result of the contract dispute, the singers have been dismissed by the opera house and now face allegations of theft in South Africa, brought by CTO for accepting the French fee while still receiving their basic salaries.<br></p> <p>Arline Jaftha, the assistant chorus mistress for CTO, who is representing her colleagues in the dispute, told the Guardian the singers believed they were being exploited because of their colour. <br></p> <p>Williams \u201cknows he has a company of talented black singers, so by paying them peanuts and knowing that living expenses in South Africa are so high [and] for us to know that we put much work into these productions when we travel abroad and we don\u2019t even get a bonus, it\u2019s very upsetting.<br></p> <p>\u201cThe freedom and respect we experienced in Aix gave everyone a different vision of how everyone should be treated.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/video/2016/sep/01/cape-town-opera-performs-in-scottish-parliament-for-culture-summit-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/5xymf\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2692806\"            data-video-name=\"Cape Town Opera performs in Scottish parliament for culture summit \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"Scottish Parliament TV\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57c815fde4b00c28eaea7578\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/09/01/160901southafrica_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/09/01/160901southafrica_WebM.webm\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/09/01/160901southafrica.m3u8\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/video/2016/sep/01/cape-town-opera-performs-in-scottish-parliament-for-culture-summit-video\">The chorus perform as Cape Town Ensemble in the Scottish parliament for a culture summit</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>The new version of Mozart\u2019s opera, which is set in pre-war, fascist-controlled Eritrea, was a centrepiece of last month\u2019s Aix festival, which included a heavy schedule of other shows, including five performances of the Debussy opera Pell\u00e9as et M\u00e9lisande, three further concerts of songs, and a wholly new performance of European medieval sacred music set to African instrumentation.</p> <p>Williams denies the chorus members were ever misled or exploited. They were told up front they would receive their normal South African salaries in France and could not be on two contracts, he said.</p> <p>Williams, whose CTO company is currently in the UK with his tribute to the former South African president Nelson Mandela, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/aug/28/mandela-trilogy-cape-town-opera-review-denis-iris-dreaming-denis-matsuev-daniil-trifonov\">Mandela Trilogy</a>, said company members were always paid their South African salaries during overseas tours.</p> <p>\u201cWe [CTO] get paid a fee which goes into the pot and we put on operas in Cape Town which lose us money every time. That\u2019s how it works.\u201d</p> <p>He insists that all chorus singers knew what the deal was. \u201cBefore we went to France we informed the 12 singers, there\u2019s this rule in France that requires you have independent contracts. Obviously you work for Cape Town Opera; we can\u2019t have you signing two contracts. You are going to have to sign a document that you are members of CTO and I have the right to negotiate a deal with the festival. CTO will receive the money and you will be paid your normal salaries.\u201d</p> <p>He accepted that the South African salary was a lot less than the money on offer from Aix. \u201cYes, because we live in South Africa. The economy in South Africa and the economy in France is totally different, as are the wages.</p> <p>\u201cYou cannot be in a contract with CTO and then sign another contract \u2026 you cannot get double salaries. While they were in France we were paying their monthly salary.</p> <p>\u201cThey were saying: \u2018They deserve this.\u2019 You know what, I deserve a million rand for the job I do, but I don\u2019t get it.

The singers say that could have put them at risk of deportation from France and being fined \u2013 a risk potentially also faced by the Aix festival, until its executives put them on their personal contracts.</p> <p>Jaftha said the Aix festival had rebuffed an effort by Williams to get them replaced by singers still on the CTO\u2019s books. The Aix festival has confirmed it plans to use the same chorus members again when Cos\u00ec Fan Tutte tours to Lille in northern France later this year and the South Korean capital, Seoul, in 2017.</p> <p>Williams denied ever calling the French contracts fake. He also denies trying to prevent the singers appearing at the festivals. \u201cHow could I possibly do that when they know the production, how would we train up people to sing it? What about the costumes? That\u2019s totally ridiculous.\u201d</p> <p>Fikile Mthetwa, a junior soloist in the chorus, said: \u201cIt has been draining, emotionally. We didn\u2019t expect it to turn out like this, but then we tried so much to get answers and they were not given to us. We tried so many times, but then they lied to us and the worst part is that he [Williams] accuses us of stealing money.\u201d</p> <p>Siphesihle Mdena, a chorus member since 2013, said: \u201cFor the first time, a contract was discovered [by accident] because we weren\u2019t meant to see it. We asked about it and we weren\u2019t given straight answers.\u201d</p> <p>Chorus members said that in one highly charged moment after they returned to South Africa from France to face disciplinary charges by CTO, there was a confrontation with Williams where he allegedly said: \u201cWho do you think you are to think that you deserve this money?\u201d</p> <p>The CTO is now pursuing the sacked singers through South Africa\u2019s labour court to recoup wages paid for the Aix productions. </p> <p>Jaftha said the opera wanted the 12 to repay the full \u20ac31,200 they were paid by Aix, after French tax was deducted. It is also pursuing Jaftha and another former staff chorus member for 40,000 rand and two freelance chorus members for another 20,000 rand.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a1acdd9b8accaa4eefc3c8750e08822fb0c979ca\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a1acdd9b8accaa4eefc3c8750e08822fb0c979ca/421_522_3076_1845/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cos\u00ec Fan Tutte at Aix.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cos\u00ec Fan Tutte at Aix.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pascal Victor/ArtComArt</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p> </p> <p>Fergus Linehan, the director of the Edinburgh international festival, told the Guardian his organisation had intervened after being told about the dispute by its counterparts in Aix. </p> <p>\u201cWe were made aware that the individual artists weren\u2019t satisfied with the arrangements that were being made,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we moved to ensure that that wasn\u2019t the case. We would never want artists to come to the [Edinburgh] festival under arrangements that they considered to be inappropriate or unfair.\u201d </p> <p>A spokeswoman for Aix said: \u201cIn order to preserve the interests of the singers and of the Cape Town Opera, the festival doesn\u2019t want to add further comments about the financial and contractual details regarding this show. Nevertheless the festival underlines that the contracts have been made in full compliance with the French law.\u201d </p> <p>White members of the cast also said they were unhappy to learn of the arrangements. Kate Lindsey, the soloist who played Dorabella in Cos\u00ec Fan Tutte, one of the two sisters who are tricked by their fianc\u00e9s into falling in love with other men, said she had been horrified when she heard of the chorus\u2019s dispute.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a12b95da4cc98854b9ad63f691511d678626c3fe\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a12b95da4cc98854b9ad63f691511d678626c3fe/0_121_3126_1876/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kate Lindsey as Dorabella and Lenneke Ruiten as Fiordiligi in Cos\u00ec Fan Tutte.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kate Lindsey as Dorabella and Lenneke Ruiten as Fiordiligi in the production.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pascal Victor/ArtComArt</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The opera\u2019s challenging relocation to a fascist-controlled African colony had been \u201ca huge leap of faith for everyone. To be portraying such ugliness and then find out during this that, unbeknownst to us, members of the chorus were fighting this battle in order to be fairly paid was absolutely sickening. We heard that Aix had stepped in and were incredibly relieved.\u201d </p> <p>Williams said: \u201cThe supreme irony of it all is that they are having the time of their lives. They have got this fantastic opportunity.</p> <p>\u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for me they would not be at Aix. I initiated all of this and I am working for Cape Town Opera. I am not their agent. If they want to be freelancers they should be freelancers, go out into the world, go and live in France, get yourself an agent and earn the money.\u201d</p> <p>Williams is also acutely aware of how it looks: a black chorus claiming exploitation, appearing in a production foregrounded by white exploitation of black people. \u201cI can see the irony \u2026 I\u2019m a writer for God\u2019s sake.\u201d</p> <p>He denied that the chorus had been exploited by CTO. \u201cNot in the slightest. You want to try and keep singers employed every single month and get their salaries going in South Africa? All the money is ploughed back into keeping the company going.\u201d</p> <p>Williams also said his whole working life had been about getting singers of all races on to the stage. \u201cI returned to South Africa when Mandela was released after having left the country to avoid military conscription. I went to go and write operas for all South Africans and to work to get opera into the townships.\u201d</p> <p>He said CTO had currently lost its money from Aix and the money it paid in salaries. \u201cI feel deeply disillusioned and disappointed. What have we got from it? Nothing but a headache and bad press and reputational damage.\u201d</p>",

If Iraq had been awarded a decent penalty shout in the first half it could have been awkward but the home side\u2019s class eventually told later on.</p> <p>\u201cPatience and persistence are key,\u201d skipper Mile Jedinak said afterwards, and you\u2019d think this is the template for home fixtures for the Socceroos this campaign. Away sides pressing hard and playing for a clean sheet, Australia huffing and puffing but requiring patience before they can blow the house down.</p> <p>Postecoglou\u2019s surprise selections were justified with Tomi Juric scoring and assisting, and Mark Milligan complementing Trent Sainsbury in defence. <br></p> <p>Attention now turns to Wednesday night and the second group match away to the UAE. Incredibly the UAE head into the fixture off the back of defeating Japan 2-1 in Saitama. Also, in case you were wondering, it\u2019s 42 degrees in Abu Dhabi right now, so expect a few changes to tonight\u2019s starting XI. </p> <p>Anyhow, thanks for your company tonight, always nice to start a qualifying campaign off with a win.

An offseason move to the UK looks to be paying off with a loan stint at Huddersfield Town in England\u2019s second tier starting promisingly. </p> <p>Mooy is the player Australia will want on the ball as often as possible, setting the tempo, buzzing around the pitch picking up return balls, waiting for the moment to play the killer pass or feed the pace of Leckie. </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57c7feafe4b04fe839bc5485\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-01T10:11:44.279Z\">11.11am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Any nervous Socceroos supporters out there looking for reassurance, try this on for size.

As Alvin and the Chipmunks sang, it\u2019s been a while but we\u2019re back in style. Well, maybe not in style, but back nonetheless, for Australia\u2019s first match in the final group phase for qualification to the 2018 World Cup in Russia.</p> <p>We\u2019re at the romantically named Perth Rectangular Stadium (aka the equally evocative nib Stadium) for Australia vs Iraq. Kick off is 8.30pm Eastern, and it\u2019s not on free to air TV, so put the kids to bed, and settle in for a relaxing night of questioning FFA\u2019s strategic planning. </p> <p>This is technically the third round of qualification for the Asian Football Confederation with Australia cruising through the second stage at the top of Group B. The Socceroos are now one of just 12 remaining teams from Asia in the mix with only the top two from two groups of six guaranteed a place in Russia. The two third placed teams face a play-off against each other, before a play-off against the fourth best team from the CONCACAF region. This is an ultramarathon, not a sprint. </p> <p>In Australia\u2019s group of six, in rank order, are Japan, Saudi Arabia, UAE, Iraq, and Thailand. It\u2019s worthy of a \u2018Group of Death\u2019 cliche if you\u2019re so inclined, but such is the growing depth of Asian football, there was never going to be a group of easybeats. </p> <p>Although it\u2019s easy to be fearful of a group like this, I think it plays into Ange Postecoglou\u2019s hands. Rather than the big boys cashing in against minnows and worrying about a dark horse or two nabbing third, every match should be competitive for every team. The likelihood is this will mean every team drops points along the journey, giving Australia, with its greater pedigree, a stronger chance of securing one of the top two spots. We\u2019ll see...</p> <p>Home advantage will be important, making tonight\u2019s contest more significant than it may appear on paper. This is simply a must win fixture for the Asian Cup winners.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57c643a5e4b04fe839bc50d8\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-31T02:40:42.299Z\">3.40am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Jonathan will be here shortly so while you\u2019re waiting why not have a quick read of John Duerden\u2019s World Cup qualifying final phase preview, including a few words on the Socceroos\u2019 opponents tonight, Iraq, \u201cthat most mercurial of Middle Eastern teams\u201d. </p> <p>Read the full article <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/01/socceroos-road-to-russia-may-be-long-but-they-would-not-have-it-any-other-way\">here</a>.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-09-01T02:59:28.027Z\">at 3.59am BST</time></p>  </div>",
  "<p>The Home Office is quietly trialling a fast-track online system to handle an expected surge in permanent residency applications from EU migrants in the UK concerned about their British immigration status in the run-up to Brexit.</p> <p>The Home Office has confirmed that it is testing the system, which simplifies the current process that includes completing, printing out and posting by special delivery an 85-page form, ahead of a public launch later this year.</p> <p>The 3.5 million EU nationals currently living in Britain do not need to apply for a \u00a365 residence card to prove their right to live and work in Britain, and there are only about 25,500 applications a year mainly from non-EU spouses or children of an EU national in Britain.</p> <p>But the continuing uncertainty of the legal status of EU citizens in Britain after Brexit means that there is now likely to be a huge increase in demand for residence applications from those who anticipate restrictions being placed on their freedom of movement within Europe.</p> <p>The Oxford University-based Migration Observatory has said that depending on the progress of the Brexit negotiations there may also be a need to quickly register all EU citizens already living in the UK. </p> <p>Migration Observatory\u2019s director, Madeleine Sumption, has estimated that the complexities of the existing paper-based system means it could take 140 years to register all 3.5 million EU citizens in Britain at current rates of processing if they all apply.</p> <p>The Financial Times quotes one person helping to operate the two-week trial, who said the trial was also \u201cpart of a stocktaking exercise\u201d to assess the numbers of EU nationals living and working in Britain.</p> <p>Jurga McClusky, head of immigration at law firm Deloitte, told the FT: \u201cIf we have EU workers with [secure residence] status there could be provisions within government policy to protect them in the long term, meaning that free movement laws will continue to influence UK immigration policy for a period of time post-Brexit.\u201d</p> <p>McClusky added that questions, however, may arise over the status of EU nationals who were not able to register and had difficulty proving their residency in Britain before a cut-off date because they were, for example, students or self-employed.</p> <p>A government spokesman said: \u201cAs part of the ongoing Home Office programme to digitise applications, we have launched a number of online options. We are currently testing an online service which simplifies the process by allowing some EEA nationals to submit electronic applications.\u201d</p> <p>The move was disclosed as the Polish deputy prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, said during a visit to London that he expected many Poles to return to Poland after Britain leaves the EU.</p> <p>\u201cI believe there will be many people coming back \u2013 a couple of hundreds of thousands may come back over the next five years,\u201d he told the BBC, adding that the killing of Arkadiusz J\u00f3\u017awik in Harlow on Saturday would \u201cpose a question mark for many families in Great Britain.\u201d.</p>",

  "<p>Robert Capa called them his most definitive images of the second world war. Seconds after the photographer had taken a portrait of a fresh-faced sergeant poised with a heavy machine gun on a Leipzig balcony, the soldier slumped to the floor. On 18 April 1945, in the final days of the conflict, he had been hit and killed by the bullets of a German sniper.</p> <p>Capa climbed through a balcony window into the flat to photograph the dead man, who lay in the open door, a looted Luftwaffe sheepskin helmet on his head. The subsequent series of photographs show the rapid spread of the soldier\u2019s blood across the parquet floor as other GIs attended to him and his fellow gunner took over his post at the machine gun.</p> <p>\u201cIt was a very clean, somehow very beautiful death and I think that\u2019s what I remember most from the war,\u201d Capa recalled two years later in a radio interview. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYe4ynXnqug\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/MYe4ynXnqug?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>The images were wired back to New York and featured prominently in Life magazine\u2019s Victory edition on 14 May.

But the US army\u2019s role in liberating Leipzig from nazism had been an unfashionable version of events during the days of communism when the dominant story was of how the Red Army \u2013 which arrived in July \u2013 had saved his city. </p> <p>\u201cAs a result the Capa connection had been suppressed because his pictures told the unfavourable story of the US troops, and so for years no one here really knew about them, they were considered subversive,\u201d said Hoffmann. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8823b7ad300a5a720cce0e462118f4aa3968084e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8823b7ad300a5a720cce0e462118f4aa3968084e/0_2074_5716_3428/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Capa\u2019s picture of the American soldier killed by a German sniper on 18 April 1945.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Capa\u2019s picture of the American soldier killed by a German sniper on 18 April 1945.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Robert Capa \u00a9 International Center of Photography / Magnum Photos</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He discovered the Last Man to Die images in a banned underground magazine at the age of 19. \u201cI was electrified by the pictures \u2013 they appeared 3D to me, and because a lot of the photos we knew in the East German era were in black and white, they struck me as being very contemporary,\u201d Hoffmann explained.</p> <p>He and a friend set about trying to locate the balcony, aided by Capa\u2019s description of the \u201cbig apartment building that overlooked the bridge\u201d on which German soldiers \u201cwere putting up considerable resistance\u201d, as well as visual references in the photograph itself. \u201cBut the only building that matched the description didn\u2019t seem to fit at all, as it had no balcony,\u201d said Hoffmann.</p> <p>The place he found \u2013 Jahnallee 61 \u2013 was on a busy crossroads in the west of the city.

  "<p>Lady Leshurr has just come back from the US. She has been spending a&#xa0;lot of time there this year, she says: \u201cWe\u2019ve been to Atlanta, LA, New Orleans, Miami, New York.\u201d She played a sold-out gig in the latter, the audience\u2019s enthusiasm apparently undimmed by the fact that she raps with a distinct Brummie twang: \u201cI didn\u2019t think they\u2019d be able to understand me, didn\u2019t think my accent, of all accents, would have crossed over like that. But they were singing my lyrics back at me. It was hilarious, hearing people with American accents saying \u2018bredrin\u2019 and \u2018wasteman\u2019, all that British urban slang.\u201d</p> <p>But mostly, she\u2019s been working on her debut album. \u201cWorking with a producer called Deputy, who made Rihanna\u2019s Bitch Better Have My Money; Bangladesh, he made Lil\u2019 Wayne\u2019s A Milli, and Diva and Video Phone for Beyonc\u00e9. I\u2019ve got a&#xa0;session with Scott Storch, he\u2019s coming back now as well. And you know Timbaland?\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/aug/31/best-music-autumn-2016-bjork-david-bowie-pink-floyd-saint-etienne-autumn-arts-preview\">It's oh so cultural: the sharpest sounds of autumn 2016</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Timbaland, the celebrated, groundbreaking producer of Missy Elliott, Aaliyah, Justin Timberlake and Beyonc\u00e9?

I\u2019m aware of his work, yes.</p> <p>\u201cWell, I\u2019ve been doing a few bits with Timbaland. Timbaland is amazing. He just rang me up on my mobile one day.\u201d The girl born Melesha O\u2019Garro giggles. \u201cI\u2019m just working with a few legendary producers.\u201d</p> <p>Here, should you want it, is empirical evidence of UK rap\u2019s sudden ascent to prominence in the US, a country traditionally resistant to the charms of the British MC, and, moreover, of the fact that a lot of people think Lady Leshurr is about to become very famous indeed. In fact, she\u2019s already famous \u2013 over the course of our interview outside of a north London wine bar, she\u2019s interrupted not once, not twice, but three times by fans. Her fame is largely thanks to a series of five freestyles called The Queen\u2019s Speech, which she released herself on iTunes and uploaded to YouTube, accompanied by low-budget videos, becoming a viral sensation. Last August\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FyodeHtVvkA\" title=\"\">Queen\u2019s Speech 4</a> racked up a fairly staggering 31m views.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yyZBLvLDFE\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/9yyZBLvLDFE?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Their lyrics were both dextrous and extremely funny, a blur of highly original put-downs \u2013 \u201cI\u2019ll upload a picture of your dog and sell it on Gumtree\u201d \u2013 and pop-culture references; they also frequently came equipped with the kind of hooklines you can imagine being chanted in playgrounds: \u201cThat\u2019s nasty, change your panties\u201d, \u201cBrush your teeth\u201d, \u201cYour lips look like crispy bacon\u201d. Moreover, they seem to have attracted a different audience compared with other UK rappers.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen videos of 60-year-old women and men in America saying \u2018Brush your teeth\u2019 and stuff, videos of a little baby watching it and laughing, do you know what I mean? I get parents saying to me: \u2018Wow, you\u2019re the only artist I let my kids listen to,\u2019 because I don\u2019t swear in my lyrics. I just don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessary. My mum brought me up really well, I&#xa0;don\u2019t swear unless I\u2019m really, really angry.</p> <p>\u201cEveryone\u2019s too cool, everyone wants to be drinking alcohol in their videos and driving flash cars, wearing big chains. I&#xa0;don\u2019t want to do that, because I don\u2019t live that. All my music, you\u2019ll never see me with my breasts hanging out or showing so much flesh that you can\u2019t show it to your kids or things like that. Because, one, I respect myself as a person; two, I want to make people understand that you don\u2019t have to go that route to be successful. If you\u2019ve got the talent, let the talent talk. Look at what I\u2019m wearing afterwards, if you have to, but listen to me first, do you know what I mean?\u201d</p> <p>In person, Lady Leshurr is charismatic and funny and smart. You can see why her new major record label \u2013 she\u2019s signed to Sony\u2019s RCA imprint \u2013 might think she\u2019s a hot prospect; in the past 12 months, she has gone from a hugely productive one-woman cottage industry, of the kind that\u2019s fuelled grime\u2019s commercial resurgence in Britain, to an artist that Timbaland and co are queuing up to work with. \u201cAll these major established artists reaching out,\u201d she frowns. \u201cI <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2015/oct/05/akon-charities-africa-lighting-energy-access\" title=\"\">had people like Akon</a> calling my phone. Busta Rhymes. I\u2019ve no idea how he even got my number. Young Money Records tried to reach out to sign me.\u201d She laughs again. \u201cI\u2019m saying it all like it\u2019s so casual, but it\u2019s just because I don\u2019t really let things excite me like that. I try to be calm with it. I\u2019m not like: \u2018Oh my God, oh my God.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Perhaps that\u2019s something to do with the fact that she\u2019s been here, or at least somewhere like it, before. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/apr/20/lady-leshurr-interview-blazin-video\" title=\"\">When the Observer profiled her</a>, in 2013, her career appeared to be about to blast off: a major label had offered her a deal, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6m7ur5jeqeY\" title=\"\">her single Blazin\u2019</a> had just deposed Justin Timberlake from No&#xa0;1 on the MTV Base chart, she was talking about launching a clothing line, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hq_HHnEe1oY&amp;list=PLxlY4t6rUn9FY_2WYVbl0qqYl9kknSO3-\" title=\"\">Friggin\u2019 L</a>, winningly named after one of her mixtapes. But then everything went wrong, of which more later.</p> <p>Or perhaps it\u2019s something to do with her background, which is substantially grimmer than the bubbly image she projects suggests. Before she became a rapper, she says, she started out writing poetry \u201cbecause I wanted to express myself. I grew up in a very strict family. My father was very strict, very violent: he had been brought up in a violent background and it\u2019s probably just a cycle. But I think that was the push to try and express myself in another way. I couldn\u2019t really express myself to him or anybody else. I was very shy, always looked down, I\u2019d never have any eye contact with people, so I&#xa0;put all that into poetry, writing down my frustration, what I felt and what I\u2019d seen, or stuff written from my mum\u2019s view, as if I was my mother. I started thinking, \u2018You know what? Why don\u2019t I&#xa0;just rap?\u2019 Because it\u2019s just poetry with a beat behind it, really.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLFd6xaRLN0\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/WLFd6xaRLN0?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>She learnt to \u201crap, produce, mix, master, everything\u201d at a youth club across the road from her home in Solihull. \u201cWe would all be in one room with the mic, someone would be DJing, the lights would be off, it\u2019d just be sweaty, loads of men. No other girls at all. At first, they were like: \u2018She\u2019s good for a girl\u2019, or \u2018Ah, she\u2019s sick because there\u2019s no other girls about\u2019 \u2013 there was always an excuse. So I thought: Fine, I\u2019m going to show you that I\u2019m better than the next man, not \u2018good for a female\u2019. So it pushed me to work hard, to write the best.\u201d</p> <p>She produced her first mixtape at 14: \u201cI had no idea how to promote, or how to get my things in shops, so I just used to leave CDs on the bus when I was on my way to school. I\u2019d hand them out to strangers, leave them on park benches, anywhere I thought people might see them and pick them up.\u201d</p> <p>Amazingly, it was a strategy that worked. Someone uploaded its contents to a website \u2013 \u201cI can\u2019t even remember what it was called, but it was big for UK artists at the time and it got loads of hits\u201d \u2013 but her burgeoning career was still hampered by her home life. \u201cI wasn\u2019t allowed out of my area. I wasn\u2019t allowed to go anywhere my friends were allowed to go to. I was always told by my father: \u2018No, you\u2019re not allowed to do this; no, you\u2019re not going to make it.\u2019 There was a time when he sat all the brothers and sisters down in a room and he wrote down job professions and he put them in a hat and whatever we picked out, we had to be. So all my sisters are like nurses, carers, my brothers are carpenters, mechanics, but I wouldn\u2019t do it. I knew that if I picked what was in that hat, I\u2019d have to start studying for it. Me and one brother who\u2019s now a footballer were the only ones stood up to him. It caused a whole heap of madness, and I just ran away for a couple of hours. He wasn\u2019t there when I got back, and from that point, I was just trying to dodge him.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ce849bfebea7cf6908e52516637287ae9d991680\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ce849bfebea7cf6908e52516637287ae9d991680/0_0_7360_4912/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lady Leshurr.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>She left home after landing a role in a local film called One Day by rapping for the director. The film was withdrawn from cinemas \u2013 \u201cIt was about gangs in Birmingham and when they showed it in Birmingham both gangs turned up to the cinema and people got stabbed and stuff\u201d \u2013 but it brought her to the attention of \u201cWiley and Kano and Ghetts, all these people I\u2019d grown up listening to ... I didn\u2019t tell my parents I was moving to London. I just packed one suitcase, I left and I never went back. I think I told my mum I&#xa0;was going on a trip with the college or&#xa0;something.\u201d</p> <p>Her real break came when she uploaded <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N-2G917g-E\" title=\"\">a syllable-perfect parody video of Chris Brown and Busta Rhymes\u2019s Look At Me Now</a> to YouTube: it got 100,000 views in half a day, and Atlantic Records in the US offered her a deal. \u201cThey flew me out and we had a conversation, but their idea was that they were going to pit me against Nicki Minaj. It was like: \u2018She\u2019s the biggest female MC and you need to take her down,\u2019 and I wasn\u2019t feeling that at all. That whole stereotype of female rappers and their supporters having to compete with each other \u2013 it seems to be a crime to be a fan of two female rappers that are successful. So I turned it down. The amount of money they were offering me was amazing. I\u2019ve always turned to music to get my mum out of the house, out of that situation, so to see that type of money thrown at me ... I\u2019m not going to lie, I cried on the plane home, because I thought I\u2019d made a mistake and my mum needed the money. It might have been my only chance. But I know by now I would probably have been dropped and my career would have been ruined.\u201d</p> <p>Back in the UK, she elected to put her career on hold for a year. \u201cI was going through a lot myself, personally. I was living on couches, living out of bags and boxes, sometimes I wouldn\u2019t even know where I was sleeping the next day. And then I went through a situation where someone completely tried to destroy my career, someone I thought was a friend, who deleted all my social networks. So I had to start again, basically. So I was like: \u2018You know what? I\u2019m starting again as a brand new artist if you\u2019re going to do that.\u2019 I&#xa0;thought: I grew up on Missy, Eminem, Busta Rhymes, they had all those funny, rewatchable videos with crazy visuals and I think that\u2019s what was and still is missing in the scene. Humour was definitely something I thought would work, I thought it would be different if I brought that to the scene, with the beats I\u2019m using, which I&#xa0;co-produce. I wouldn\u2019t quite call them grime, they\u2019re a bit slower, people say they\u2019re a bit trap. I just wanted to create something new and fresh.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N-2G917g-E\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/-N-2G917g-E?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>It was a plan that has clearly worked beyond her wildest dreams, although she says she\u2019s keen not to be seen as just \u201ca funny person ... The album\u2019s going to do the talking, because everyone\u2019s thinking this is all I do, the funny stuff, and the album\u2019s going to show that it\u2019s not.\u201d</p> <p>The album isn\u2019t the only thing on her mind at the moment. She\u2019s still thinking about a clothing line, although, alas, the Friggin\u2019 L name has been retired. She\u2019s talking about going back into acting. She\u2019s starting work on her own sketch show, starring a selection of alter-egos she created on Snapchat. Whatever happens, she says, she has already managed to achieve her dream: with the money she made from The Queen\u2019s Speech\u2019s iTunes sales and YouTube hits, she\u2019s buying her mum a house. \u201cI just kept setting money aside, and it\u2019s all still in the process at the moment. You know how mortgages are. But I\u2019m eventually going to take her there, and it\u2019s going to have a massive bow on it, and I\u2019m going to pretend it\u2019s my house that I\u2019ve bought in Birmingham and then tell her it\u2019s hers. She has no idea.\u201d Unless she reads this, of course.</p> <p>She drains her glass of fizzy wine. \u201cSo much has happened just because of uploading a couple of videos, you know.

  "<p>Egypt has increased the penalty for practising female genital mutilation to a sentence of between three and 15 years in jail, although campaigners say this will have little impact. </p> <p>Successful convictions of doctors or others found to be performing the procedure are extremely rare, despite it being illegal in Egypt since 2008. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/02/egyptian-doctor-convicted-of-fgm-death-serves-three-months-in-jail\">First doctor convicted of FGM death in Egypt only spent three months in jail</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Raslan Fadl, the first doctor to be sentenced in Egypt, was recently <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/02/egyptian-doctor-convicted-of-fgm-death-serves-three-months-in-jail\">found to have walked free</a> after serving the minimum three-month sentence.

  "<p>The Clinton campaign <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jun/27/hillary-clinton-necono-republican-endorsements-donald-trump-policy-issues\">has now spent months</a> trying to convince relatively obscure former Republican officials to endorse her campaign while also adopting many Republican slogans and arguments in her quest for the presidency. </p> <p>One has to wonder how much long term damage she is doing to progressive policies by deploying this strategy, even if she beats Donald Trump along the way. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Clinton <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/31/hillary-clinton-derides-donald-trump-mexico-trip-american-legion\">gave a speech in Ohio</a> on Wednesday with yet another former Bush official, James Clad. The speech was billed as touting \u201cAmerican exceptionalism\u201d, one of the more repellent nationalistic concepts that Republicans have used to shame progressives in the past. She <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/clinton-stress-american-exceptionalism-ohio-41764569\">spoke mostly about foreign policy</a>, a subject in which Clinton \u2013 with her penchant for supporting foreign wars and beefed up US military presence everywhere \u2013 seemingly has more in common with mainstream Republicans than the Obama administration.</p> <p>Last week, Clinton again handed legitimacy to the Republican party through the way she has decided to attack Trump. She gave a speech in which she praised prior GOP candidates for their treatment of Muslim Americans, including <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://twitter.com/cd_hooks/status/768934791622209536\">George W Bush</a>, in an attempt to rhetorically separate Trump from these other supposedly upstanding Republicans. In the process, she is kneecapping Democratic candidates around the country who are attempting to retake the House and Senate. </p> <p>Instead of hanging Trump around all Republicans\u2019 necks, she is cleaving him off from other GOP candidates and giving them an easy out, despite the fact that Trump <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jul/29/donald-trump-monster-gop-polls\">is a direct product of the GOP\u2019s pandering</a> to classist and racist elements of society for a decade. (Leaked Democratic National Committee emails show that at least some <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/293428-leaked-emails-show-dem-split-on-linking-trump-to-gop\">Democrats were worried</a> about this exact scenario.)</p> <p>Whether Clinton\u2019s strategy of trying to peel off a small percentage of Republicans to win the presidency will actually work remains to be seen. There seems to be scant evidence in the polls that a significant amount of Republicans will support her; Clinton\u2019s advantage mostly stems from the fact that black and Hispanic Americans understandably oppose Trump <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/07/13/new-polls-in-pennsylvania-and-ohio-show-donald-trump-with-0-percent-of-the-black-vote/\">in historic numbers</a>. But if the strategy hinders Democrats from retaking Congress, the damage is going to be seen for years.</p> <p>But it\u2019s not just the outreach and compliments to normally detestable Republicans that are the problem. Clinton and the Democratic leadership are latching onto abhorrent concepts and arguments that Republicans have been deploying for decades.</p> <p>Take House Democrats, for example, who on Tuesday <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2016/08/31/congressional-dems-call-on-fbi-to-investigate-their-political-adversaries-kremlin-ties/\">called on the FBI to investigate</a> the Trump campaign for its alleged ties to Russia and Vladimir Putin. What a great idea! It\u2019s not like calling for a law enforcement investigation into your political enemies for nebulous connections to the Kremlin <a href=\"http://www.coldwar.org/articles/50s/senatorjosephmccarthy.asp\">has ever backfired before</a>. </p> <p>And then there\u2019s the Clinton campaign\u2019s response to questions about large donations to the Clinton Foundation from foreign governments that seem to coincide with the <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2016/08/25/why-did-the-saudi-regime-and-other-gulf-tyrannies-donate-millions-to-the-clinton-foundation/\">state department approving large weapons deals</a> to dictatorships like Saudi Arabia and Bahrain. The Clinton camp has <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2016/08/25/why-did-the-saudi-regime-and-other-gulf-tyrannies-donate-millions-to-the-clinton-foundation/\">essentially been arguing</a> that since there\u2019s no evidence of quid pro quo, there\u2019s nothing wrong. Many commentators (including <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2016/8/25/12615340/hillary-clinton-foundation\">a lot of ethics experts</a>) have said that this comes very close to corruption, and it sounds an awful lot like the GOP\u2019s <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/768788364514435077\">long-held defense of Citizens United</a>.</p> <p>This is the same logic, too, that the Clinton camp used against Bernie Sanders when he continually pointed out the large number of bank and oil lobbyists who were giving money to the network of Clinton Super Pacs and interest groups during the primary. As campaign finance expert Lawrence Lessig <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-clintons-citizens-united-and-21st-century-corruption/2015/05/08/7f11a0d6-f57b-11e4-b2f3-af5479e6bbdd_story.html?utm_term=.a2896f9ab837\">has previously pointed out</a>, this tactic is further entrenching big corporate money into our political system, even though Democrats have spent years pointing to the dissent in Citizens United that made clear the fundamental problem with corporate money in politics <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/715918806800080896\">is much broader than explicitly buying a vote</a> on a specific issue. </p> <p>Clinton may think that a shift toward the right is her best way to defeat Trump. But given that it\u2019s likely Trump will go down in flames anyway, it should be a cause of concern to all candidates who are attempting to defeat other Republicans along the way.</p>",
  "<p>Another day, another piece of news that suggests the economy is coping with the result of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\">Brexit</a> vote much better than expected. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/01/uk-factories-bounce-back-brexit-shock-eu-referendum-manufacturing-sector\">The latest health check of manufacturing</a> suggests that the record plunge suffered in July was a kneejerk response to the result of the referendum.</p> <p>All the lost ground was made up in August \u2013 and then some. The closely watched Markit/Cips report recorded the joint biggest monthly increase in industry\u2019s performance in the 25-year history of the purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI), taking it to its highest level since last October.</p> <p>A couple of words of caution are in order. Sentiment is clearly volatile and, as Lee Hopley of the EEF pointed out, it is possible that an overshoot downwards has been followed by an overshoot upwards. What\u2019s more, manufacturing accounts for only one-tenth of the economy\u2019s output, so a more complete picture of how the economy is faring in these early post-Brexit-vote days will only emerge when the services sector PMI is released on Monday.</p> <p>Even so, a number of tentative conclusions can be drawn. The first is that manufacturers are being helped by the fall in the value of the pound, which is making UK goods more competitive on global markets. Although there is evidence that the fall in the value of sterling is pushing up manufacturers\u2019 costs, movements in the currency market since 23 June have been broadly positive, since they have supported activity and will help rebalance the economy.</p> <p>The second conclusion is that policy decisions have made a difference. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/13/theresa-may-becomes-britains-prime-minister\">Theresa May\u2019s swift coronation</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/04/bank-of-england-cuts-uk-interest-rates\">stimulus provided by the Bank of England</a> have made manufacturers more hopeful that they can not just survive but thrive after the referendum.</p> <p>Finally, while it is still early days and companies are still mulling over big hiring and investment decisions, predictions made ahead of the referendum that the economy would be plunged into an immediate recession by a vote to leave look wide of the mark.</p> <p>Indeed, most of those who did forecast instant dire consequences are already retreating to their fallback position: that Brexit will be a slow burn, with the impact only felt over time. That seems sensible. It is still quite possible that the economy will slow in the second half of 2016, but there has been scant evidence so far to suggest that it is spiralling into the abyss.</p>",

  "<p>One of the most horrifying experiences of the aftermath of Peter Connelly\u2019s death was the suggestion by David Cameron in the Sun that the social workers including myself should be subject to criminal charges. That didn\u2019t happen. Instead, we were subjected to the \u201ccourt of public opinion\u201d \u2013 or what felt like the anger of a mob. </p> <p>I\u2019ve often wondered whether being charged with a criminal offence might have allowed us and the paediatrician who lost her job to have a voice. We could have told our stories ourselves rather than leaving it to several enlightened journalists, documentary makers and writers when it was all too late to reverse the damage. In my book, Learning from Baby P: The Politics of Blame, Fear and Denial, I refer to the blaming of social workers as a \u201ccultural trope\u201d in order to capture its habitual nature now embedded as a belief, reality or truism that goes beyond thought or reason.</p> <p>These experiences have given me a particular perspective on the Conservative government\u2019s proposal for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/mar/03/david-cameron-child-abuse-ignore-jail\">a criminal offence of \u201cwilful neglect\u201d</a>, which would apply to social workers and others. The criminal sanctions will cover inaction, concealment and/or deliberate cover-ups and would carry a maximum jail sentence of five years. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/aug/19/stop-scapegoating-social-workers-to-better-protect-children-shoesmith-says\">Stop scapegoating social workers to better protect children, Shoesmith says</a> </p> </aside>  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/social-care-network/2015/mar/03/jail-risk-social-workers-child-abuse-views-from-sector\">Social workers protested against these proposals</a> when they were first announced. But such protests risk digging a deeper hole. I often ask roomfuls of social workers two questions: \u201cWhat would the British public say if they are asked if social workers should be locked up for wilful neglect?\u201d \u2013 their silence conveys a resounding yes; and \u201cdo you want to belong to a profession that retains a social worker who is guilty of wilful neglect?\u201d \u2013 and the silence conveys a resounding no.</p> <p>But what is wilful neglect and how would it be defined? How would wider issues \u2013 such as the impact of austerity on families and on the services that seek to support them \u2013 be accounted for? <a href=\"https://twitter.com/isabelletrowler/status/572860786789367808\">Isabelle Trowler</a>, the chief social worker for children and families, suggested the proposal to jail social workers \u201ccomes with [the] territory of holding responsibility on behalf of the state\u201d but that it would be very difficult to secure a conviction. More crucially, she described the government\u2019s proposal as matching \u201cthe public [and] political mood\u201d, something we saw demonstrated in the case of Baby P. This notion of locking up social workers might be no more than political posturing, but that doesn\u2019t mean it can be ignored. </p> <p>There are lessons that can be learned from Germany, where social workers have been charged in cases of fatal child abuse/neglect with \u201cnegligent manslaughter by omission\u201d. However most cases are terminated, overturned, or result in modest fines due to rules of \u201cdiversion\u201d or \u201cquasi-conviction\u201d (presumably because social workers didn\u2019t actually kill or harm the child) and social workers return to their jobs. Crucially there is no naming of professionals or media campaigns on the scale of those seen in the UK. In effect, the case against German social workers is primarily legal and in the UK it is open to the complex interactions of the tabloid media, political opportunism and public perception. It\u2019s the difference between a fair hearing in court that conforms to fundamental concepts of justice and equality, and the court of ill-informed and often manipulated public opinion. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/aug/19/sharon-shoesmith-baby-p-haringey-social-services-interview\">Sharon Shoesmith on Baby P, child protection and the tabloid media: \u2018I came very close to\u00a0not standing up again\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>So might the introduction of a criminal offence of wilful neglect give social workers access to a fair hearing? What first appeared as a threat that drew a defensive reaction might be the best opportunity the profession has had to communicate the challenges of the job and to mount a proper legal defence.</p> <p>But if the profession is to embrace such radical change it must change radically itself. At times in the last eight years I have felt that my colleagues and I were very badly let down by the profession. Why is it that the profession did not challenge this cultural trope when we were so roundly vilified? Why has the profession not presented the arguments and stood up for itself? The College of Social Work, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/jun/19/college-of-social-work-closes-financial-difficulties-baby-p\">which failed to survive</a>, was situated too close to government and unable to represent social workers. It attracted only a quarter of the profession yet the only independent member-led professional body, the British Association of Social Workers, also only attracts a quarter of social workers. This low level of engagement of social workers in professional organisations that strive to support them suggests a fragmentation of the profession. </p> <p> Whether the criminal offence of wilful neglect becomes law or not, social workers at all levels of seniority must unite under one strong independent representative body; the professional organisation must develop the wherewithal to support social workers through litigation and given strong membership have the ability to fund that litigation; employers must consider professional indemnity arrangements more thoroughly; social workers who are accused should have access to support networks to prepare for a fair hearing, and the profession must lead on developing and promoting new discourses that improve the knowledge and understanding of the public.</p> <p>Social work is an enormously challenging job. It is very successful in protecting children. But the public don\u2019t know that. It is only by being a more united profession \u2013 led with much greater determination \u2013 that it can take back control and build pride and confidence, which will in turn make it even more successful. </p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/social-care/\">Join the Social Care Network</a> to read more pieces like this.

  "<p>Richard Price is sitting in the small, brightly lit kitchen of his Harlem brownstone, talking about The Night Of, his astonishingly successful and utterly addictive crime drama. \u201cYeah,\u201d he says. \u201cEverybody\u2019s going crazy about it.

In America, where the first series has just thundered to a close, everyone has a theory about wide-eyed Naz, played by Riz Ahmed, whose murder trial drives the action.

But upstairs, the walls tell a different story: on them hang a series of striking photographs by Weegee, the notorious New York <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2012/jan/19/weegee-murder-photographs-pictures-new-york\">ambulance-chaser</a> of the 1930s and 40s who, like the laconic Price, made murder his business. </p> <p>Price, now 66, was born into a working-class family in the Bronx. He made his name as the chronicler of \u201cNew York in the trenches\u201d, finding success at 24 with his novel The Wanderers, a brutal coming-of-age drama about gang members in New York. \u201cI look at it now and think, \u2018There there, kid, calm down\u2019,\u201d he sniffs in his strong Bronx accent. </p> <p>Price went on to write a further eight novels including Clockers, Freedomland and, most recently, police thriller The Whites. \u201cWhen I wrote Clockers, it was after an eight-year hiatus. I was a different person. I\u2019d kicked a drug habit, got married, started making solid money as a screenwriter and, most importantly, I had two children. As you get older you get wiser. Hopefully.\u201d</p> <p>He remains ambivalent about his screenwriting career, successful as it is. More than once he refers to it as \u201ca job\u201d. It\u2019s clear novels are where his heart lies. Yet this is the man who wrote The Color of Money, Martin Scorsese\u2019s celebrated 1986 drama about pool hustlers Tom Cruise and Paul Newman, as well as the Al Pacino thriller Sea of Love and numerous episodes of The Wire. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d2d10d46f9a1bdc29ec62c87cb2b4ba424532724\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d2d10d46f9a1bdc29ec62c87cb2b4ba424532724/0_346_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Everybody knows prisons are hellholes\u2019 \u2026 Michael K Williams as inmate Freddy in The Night Of.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Everybody knows prisons are hellholes\u2019 \u2026 Michael K Williams as inmate Freddy in The Night Of.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Craig Blankenhorn/HBO</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThe Wire was easy to write for,\u201d he says. \u201cDavid Simon wore his crown very lightly.\u201d Can he pick a favourite contribution? \u201cI love the scene where <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZ9PaGeXyfY\">Omar strides down the street in his pyjamas to get cereal</a> and everyone starts throwing crack vials out the window.

But I don\u2019t know how to make doctors or engineers funny. I\u2019ve established my turf.\u201d</p> <p>Price has a reputation as the bard of the men in blue, a writer who understands life on the beat. How does he feel about deaths in police custody? \u201cWhen Eric Garner happened, I talked to a lot of cops and they\u2019d say, \u2018Yeah, it\u2019s fucked up.\u2019 Or they go, \u2018Oh well, there\u2019s no excuse: sometimes the wrong people are hired.\u2019 But police support police, so they\u2019d hedge. Then the minute <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2016/jul/07/dallas-protest-police-shooting-live%20boom\">Dallas happened</a>, it\u2019s the great divide: us v them.

Black Lives Matter is about something specific: those deaths.\u201d</p> <p>The show has attracted some criticism for perceived inaccuracies in its legal scenes, as well as for its treatment of women. Price is fairly relaxed about the former. \u201cLook, any finicky person of any profession represented in a film could probably pick it apart.

Price initially responds by listing the women on the show, then catches himself: \u201cThe problem is that there is a preponderance of male writers and male creators in the industry. I also think men feel more comfortable writing about men because they\u2019re very leery of writing cliches about women. It\u2019s a defensive thing.\u201d</p> <p>He admits that he is uncomfortable about the opening episode\u2019s graphic murder. \u201cI think it\u2019s a legit thing to criticise: once again, we have a victim who\u2019s a girl and she\u2019s an enigma not a real person. We inherited that from the British show and I\u2019ll be honest \u2013 I didn\u2019t see anything too wrong with it, but I did dislike the ghoulish mass of blood. I wanted a clean atrocity, very neat and surgical.\u201d</p> <p>Where the show works brilliantly is in its depiction of New York in all its bustling glory. The taut opening episode takes us from Naz\u2019s family home in Jackson Heights, Queens, to the swanky home in Manhattan\u2019s Upper West Side where troubled victim Andrea lives. In later episodes, we see the grotty court where Turturro, as down-on-his-luck lawyer John Stone, scrabbles for cases; and the brutal confines of the city\u2019s infamous prison, Rikers Island. \u201cStories have to be written with a dry eye,\u201d says Price. \u201cYou should not have heartstrings to tug. Sentimentality is like wearing galoshes when you should be wearing ballet slippers. It\u2019s manipulation.\u201d </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e91f7e2fe55d5b61c7ecde945b7a1eb98bad8ddc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e91f7e2fe55d5b61c7ecde945b7a1eb98bad8ddc/120_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Scrabbling for cases \u2026 John Turturro as down-on-his-luck lawyer John Stone.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Scrabbling for cases \u2026 John Turturro as down-on-his-luck lawyer John Stone.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: HBO</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Night Of portrays a bleakly realistic world, with Naz\u2019s case leading to Islamophobic incidents like the beating of a Pakistani cab driver \u2013 an event that found its own eerie echo in the <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/news/archive/2016/08/new-york-imam-killed/496019/?utm_source=atlgp\">recent murder of an Imam and his assistant in Queens</a>. \u201cWe didn\u2019t come at this with the idea of, \u2018Oh, we\u2019re going to expose social justice or the hellhole that is Rikers.\u2019 Everybody knows it\u2019s a hellhole. Prisons always are. We weren\u2019t to know what would happen with Donald Trump \u2013 when we were first writing, who the hell was Trump? \u2013 or Eric Garner or Isis. It\u2019s more that if you write stuff that reflects the vibrations in the air, some of it will make headlines. That makes you look like Nostradamus.\u201d</p> <p>With The Night Of now finished, he has moved on to his next TV project, reuniting with Simon on The Deuce, which stars James Franco and Maggie Gyllenhaal. Documenting the porn industry in 1970s Times Square, the show doesn\u2019t exactly sound like a controversy-free ride. Price laughs. \u201cThe subject matter isn\u2019t easy. Listen, we have abusive pimps, we have prostitutes. But if we were to whitewash that, then what\u2019s the point? The bigger trick is how to portray the world of pornography without actually being titillating. David is so sensitive sometimes I wanna kill him.

<p>Welcome to Thursday on politics live. Deficits are the key today, sleep deficits that is. As you will see with <strong>Mike Bowers\u2019</strong> picture gallery, the press ball went to the wee hours last night. This is normally a midwinter event but, with the eight-week campaign, it became an almost spring ball.<br></p> <p>So with the coffee carts and the cafe packed to maximum capacity, we had best get on with the day. There is a lot around this morning. The government has 16 more bills coming to the parliament, including the company tax cuts. The Coalition agenda is dominated by budget measures but there were red faces all round late yesterday after Labor discovered a $107m counting error in the omnibus bill. The resulting mathematical haircut takes the value of the savings bill below $6bn.<br></p> <p>Labor is meeting with victims of shonky financial advisors to press the case for the bank royal commission. Labor\u2019s point is that the small business ombudsman\u2019s inquiry is not broad enough. <a href=\"http://www.afr.com/news/politics/labor-kept-at-bay-over-banks-20160831-gr5kes\">Phil Coorey at the Fin</a> reports the ombudsman <strong>Kate Carnell</strong> will be looking at 23 specific cases that were concerning Coalition bank critics. While this approach obviously stops those critics from crossing the floor, you do wonder about the rest of the victims who have not managed to make contact with a Coalition backbencher.<br></p> <p><strong>Bob Hawke</strong> is in the house! The former PM will be launching Anthony Albanese\u2019s biography by journalist <strong>Karen Middleton</strong> at 11am. I will bring pics and hopefully a bit of colour from that event.<br></p> <p>And at 9am, the current prime minister will be making a statement to the house regarding counter terrorism. I can\u2019t tell you anymore because ... actually, I don\u2019t know anymore than that.<br></p> <p>There\u2019s lots more besides. Stick around and chat in the thread. I\u2019m on the Twits @gabriellechan and he is @mpbowers. I\u2019m on my second litre of water, the sun is shining, the birds are singing and its the last sitting day of the parliament.

Policies were based on returning community control, especially in schools. </p> <p>He said there would also be a yet-to-be-named local implementation board to bind government policies together and \u201censure locals have meaningful control of their lives\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cBecause when we make decisions in Canberra, we can get it a little bit right but when we get it wrong we get a lot wrong,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you make decisions locally, occasionally you\u2019ll make mistakes but when you get it right you\u2019ll get a lot right and when you get it wrong you get it a little wrong.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ll avoid the common mistake of when someone makes a mistake in a remote community, locally, we strip that decision-making power back to Darwin. That\u2019s part of that meaningful relationship with local Territorians and giving that control.\u201d</p> <p>Gunner also promised the continuation of the Country Liberal party\u2019s community champions program, albeit with changes. Labor has committed to sacking 26 chief executives and deputy chief executives as part of its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/25/labor-win-in-northern-territory-would-mean-delay-or-cuts-of-223m-in-projects\">cost cutting by consolidating government departments</a>. </p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve always been worried about some communities missing out essentially under community champions,\u201d he said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t, I thought, a structurally good fit. </p> <p>\u201cBut some communities do like their champions and I\u2019m not going to take away something that they like.\u201d</p> <p>Gunner said executive job losses would not be impacted by whether that individual was one of the community champions; the government would make sure communities retained a representative after the \u201crestructure\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cDifferent communities have different regard for the CEOs who are their champions,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a structural solution to give direct access to government and solving issues.

  "<p>Raihan Abir glances at the book in his hands, his eyes focused on the religious symbols that dot its reddish brown cover.

Abir is one of the few people connected to the book who is still alive.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/07/atheist-blogger-avijit-roy-returning-bangladesh-risky\">Atheist blogger Avijit Roy 'was not just a person \u2026 he was a movement'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>His co-author, Avijit Roy, was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/feb/27/american-atheist-blogger-hacked-to-death-in-bangladesh\">hacked to death in 2015</a> on a street in Dhaka as horrified onlookers watched. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/31/faisal-abedin-deepan-bangladesh-secular-publisher-hacked-to-death\">The book\u2019s two publishers were both attacked</a>; one managed to survive while the other was killed in his office. Abir and his wife were forced to flee Bangladesh, ending up in Toronto. </p> <p>The attacks are part of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/11/bangladesh-murders-bloggers-foreigners-religion\">a killing spree that has targeted activists, bloggers and professors in Bangladesh</a>. Since 2013, extremists \u2013 many of them wielding machetes \u2013 have killed more than 50 bloggers, secularists, LGBT activists and religious minorities, according to Human Rights Watch. Scores of others have been seriously injured.</p> <p>Many of those killed had publicly expressed opinions on religion, science, sexuality or music. Both Isis and Ansar al-Islam, a militant group linked to al-Qaida, have claimed responsibility for the killings.</p> <p>The common thread linking the lives of many of the victims is <a href=\"https://mukto-mona.com/en\">Mukto-mona</a>, meaning Free Thinker, a Bengali-English website dedicated to the discussion of topics that range from atheism to science. Abir became involved with the site in 2007, drawn to what he describes as a window on to a world long hidden in conservative Bangladesh. </p> <p>\u201cI was living in a bubble with lots of propaganda fed to me by society,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was really easy to reach the age of 22 in Bangladesh and never hear about the science of evolution rather than intelligent design propaganda.\u201d </p> <p>When he and Roy released Philosophy of Disbelief, the book became an instant hit, feeding into the fledgling conversation ignited by websites such as Mukto-mona. </p> <p>But it also caught the attention of Islamist extremists who were determined to make Bangladesh reflect their own conservative beliefs . Abir points to the 2013 murder of secularist blogger <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/31/two-sentenced-death-bangladesh-blogger-ahmed-rajib-haider\">Ahmed Rajib Haider</a>, hacked to death in front of his home, as the first of what would become a terrifying pattern of murders in the country. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"eaec7ac3d2eaf5b0b26a5a931edfb11cb8b9f34b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eaec7ac3d2eaf5b0b26a5a931edfb11cb8b9f34b/0_0_3648_5472/667.jpg\" alt=\"Raihan Abir, Samia Hossain and their daughter Sophie.\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Raihan Abir, Samia Hossain and their daughter Sophie.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samiul Alam Anik</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Two years later \u2013 as Abir was becoming accustomed to regularly receiving death threats by email and text \u2013 the number of attacks began to spike. \u201cIt got out of control,\u201d he says. </p> <p>The death of his co-author left him racked with grief. Apprehension set in months later, after another blogger, Washiqur Rahman, was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/30/blogger-hacked-death-bangladesh-dhaka\">hacked to death outside his home</a>. </p> <p>\u201cI knew it was my turn,\u201d Abir says with a wry smile. The idea began to permeate every moment of his life. Each morning his wife, Samia Hossain, would emerge first from their home to check for attackers. \u201cOnce she said it was clear, we would hit the road on our motorbike,\u201d he says. Hossain kept constant watch behind them as he drove. </p> <p>Despite the sweltering heat, he would keep his motorbike helmet on as walked through the university campus where he was completing his PhD in biomedical engineering. \u201cMy physician friends said you have to keep your helmet on to keep your head intact.\u201d </p> <p>When his PhD supervisor decided to attend a medical conference in Toronto, he urged Abir to join him and seek refuge in Canada. Abir hesitated, torn by the idea of leaving behind his research on the use of telemedicine in rural areas and still tied to the challenge of carving out a school of secular thought in the increasingly polarised country. </p> <p>The final push came with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/12/third-atheist-blogger-killed-in-bangladesh-after-knife-attack\">the death of Ananta Bijoy Das</a>, an editor of Philosophy of Disbelief. The two had been in constant contact as Das \u2013 worried about the death threats he was receiving \u2013 attempted to secure a visa to Sweden. Soon after his application was rejected by Swedish authorities, he was attacked by several masked men wielding machetes in broad daylight. </p> <p>In June of last year Abir travelled to Toronto, leaving behind Hossain who was six months pregnant at the time. Neither had any idea when they would see each other again. \u201cI knew that I might not be able to see her for three or four years,\u201d he says. </p> <p>Still, she was ecstatic to see him go. \u201cWhen the plane left and was in the air, I knew he would be alive. I was so happy,\u201d says Hossain. An architect by training, she followed in her husband\u2019s footsteps, applying for a visa to attend a conference in her field in Toronto. Two months later, a very pregnant Hossain was on a plane to Toronto.</p> <p>\u201cI thought it would be the happiest day of my life,\u201d says Abir. But while Hossain was in the air, news came of another death among their tight-knit circle of friends. Atheist blogger Niloy Neel had been hacked to death in his home. \u201cIt was a really stressful time,\u201d he says. \u201cWe were losing the brightest minds of Bangladesh one by one.\u201d </p> <p>Things soon began to fall into place for the young couple. Days after they found a place to call home in Toronto, their daughter Sophie was born. Their application for refugee status was accepted a few months later. </p> <p>Slowly the pair allowed themselves to shake off the fear that had coloured their lives in Dhaka. \u201cIn Bangladesh I literally would take one step and look behind my back. I wasn\u2019t supposed to be alive,\u201d says Abir as he sits at a table in the couple\u2019s sparsely decorated apartment. His wife nods sombrely in agreement as she sits next to him. \u201cYeah, he wasn\u2019t.\u201d </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/11/bangladesh-murders-bloggers-foreigners-religion\">Inside Bangladesh\u2019s killing fields: bloggers and outsiders targeted by fanatics</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Toronto\u2019s sizable Bangladeshi community, however, has meant the couple hasn\u2019t been able to let their guard down entirely.

So far, according to Human Rights Watch, this has largely translated into the detention of some 15,000 suspects with scant evidence. </p> <p>Thousands of miles away from Dhaka and its climate of fear, Abir\u2019s hope for the country continues to run deep. \u201cNow, yes we are being attacked, our atheist writers, our bloggers are refugees in the world. But things will change, Bangladesh is not like that.\u201d He continues to work with Mukto-mona, his passion for its ideas now accompanied by a deep sense of responsibility as one of the few who made it out alive.</p> <p>His focus is now on the dozens of Bangladeshi writers still under threat in the country, many of them in hiding and fearing for their lives. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to make connections with the outer world and get them to safe places. We don\u2019t have any resources, we\u2019re just trying to do what we can,\u201d he says. \u201cBut it is really difficult to fight off machetes with a pen.\u201d </p>",
  "<blockquote> <p><em>I too am looking for a laptop for my son. He turns 14 in October and will be starting his GCSE courses. He will mostly use it for school work in Microsoft Office. (He tends to use his PlayStation for games.) He\u2019ll also want to store videos \u2013 so plenty of storage is paramount \u2013 and he wants to create videos for YouTube. My budget is \u00a3300-400.</em></p> <p><em>I have taken note of your recommendations in an earlier article, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/2015/nov/05/which-laptop-should-we-buy-for-our-child\">Which laptop should we buy for our child?</a> </em><strong>Paula</strong></p> </blockquote> <p>Last year I noted that many schools were adopting Windows detachables or two-in-ones, and these now have a wide market. Their main advantages are that they do double duty as tablets and laptops, while being both portable and very cheap. They also tend to be reasonably robust. Teenagers tend to break laptop hinges, and that\u2019s generally less of a problem with detachables. In fact, some models have no hinges to break.</p> <p>The drawbacks with cheap 2-in-1s are that they don\u2019t have enough memory or storage for much serious work. They usually have only 2GB of memory and 32GB eMMC Flash memory drives, which work more like SD cards than SSDs (solid-state drives).</p> <p>These machines are certainly capable of handling email, YouTube and iPlayer videos, social networking, web browsing, word processing and general school work. They can run Microsoft Office programs, though you\u2019d probably not want to run more than two at once. However, they don\u2019t have enough storage for anyone who wants to make and/or keep videos, and they don\u2019t have enough processing power to do much in the way of video editing.</p> <p>In fact, the amount of importance you ascribe to video editing may well govern your choice.</p> <h2><strong>Mainstream laptops</strong></h2> <p>Today\u2019s mainstream laptops come in two varieties, which can be roughly characterised as new and old. The new ones are convertibles with hinges that allow you to fold the screen back through 360 degrees for tablet use. These PCs are usually thin and light, and they are designed for portability. Lenovo pioneered the 360-degree hinge with its Yoga range of laptops, but now almost every PC manufacturer has similar models. The HP and Asus versions are also worth a look.</p> <p>The old ones are traditional laptops of the sort you could buy a couple of decades ago, albeit for many times the price. They usually have 15.6in screens, and many still have built-in DVD or Blu-ray optical drives. They have large hard drives rather than new-style SSDs, and they don\u2019t offer long battery life. You can move them around easily enough, but most of them are not designed for portability. You wouldn\u2019t want your son to carry one to school.</p> <p>If you decide on a new-style convertible, look at the Lenovo Yoga 300 and 500 ranges \u2013 your budget means you can afford a Yoga 500, but probably not a Yoga 700 or 900. You should be able to pick up a Yoga 500 with a 14in screen, Intel Core i3-5005U processor, 4GB of memory and a 1TB hard drive for <a href=\"http://www.johnlewis.com/lenovo-yoga-500-convertible-laptop-intel-core-i3-4gb-ram-1tb-14-/p2263669\">\u00a3349.95</a>, and this week, John Lewis is offering them with a free three-year guarantee.</p> <p>This would be a decent all-rounder, and it has more than enough storage space. It should also be able to handle YouTube videos, which are usually short and not high resolution (eg 480p or 720p). However, you can also find Yoga laptops with 8GB if you shop around, and sometimes they go for on sale for very low prices.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.johnlewis.com/dell-inspiron-11-3000-series-2-in-1-laptop-intel-core-m3-4gb-ram-500gb-11-6-/p2825582\">Dell Inspiron 11 3000</a> range of 2-in-1s is also worth considering and is now stocked by John Lewis. You could get one with a slower Intel Core M3-6Y30 processor, 4GB of memory and 500GB hard drive for \u00a3329.95.</p> <p>If you decide on an old-style laptop with a 15.6in screen, there are endless options. Have a look at the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_2?url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;field-keywords=Asus+X555LA+\">Asus X555LA</a> and similar X55 models, the HP Pavilion range, and the Lenovo IdeaPad 300.</p> <p>All these come in dozens of variations, with the processor being an important component of the price. The cheaper models will have Atom-based Pentium or slower Celeron processors. After that, the price climbs as you move up from a Core i3 to an i5 or i7.</p> <p>The price also increases according to the age of the processor, which is shown by the first number in the string that identifies the actual chip. For example, a second-generation \u2013 now very old \u2013 chip would be identified as a Core iX-2xxx and a fifth generation as a Core iX-5xxx. Seventh generation Core chips, codenamed <a href=\"http://venturebeat.com/2016/08/30/intel-launches-its-7th-generation-core-processors-for-the-4k-and-vr-era/\">Kaby Lake</a>, are on the way.</p> <p>For example, you could get an <a href=\"http://www.johnlewis.com/asus-x553sa-laptop-intel-pentium-8gb-ram-1tb-15-6-/p2513655\">ASUS X553SA</a> with a Pentium N3700 for \u00a3279.95, a <a href=\"http://www.pcworld.co.uk/gbuk/computing/laptops/laptops/dell-inspiron-15-5000-15-6-laptop-black-10146365-pdt.html\">Dell Inspiron 15 5000</a> with a Pentium 3825U for \u00a3349.99, an <a href=\"http://www.pcworld.co.uk/gbuk/computing/laptops/laptops/hp-pavilion-15-ab270sa-15-6-laptop-red-10138120-pdt.html\">HP Pavilion 15</a> with a Core i3-5157U for \u00a3349.98, or a <a href=\"http://www.johnlewis.com/lenovo-ideapad-300-laptop-intel-core-i5-8gb-ram-1tb-15-6-black/p2457271\">Lenovo IdeaPad 300</a> with a Core i5-6200U for \u00a3399.95. All four have 8GB of memory and 1TB of storage and would be fine for most purposes. However, the fast Core i5-6200U would be far better than the slow Pentium N3700 for video editing.</p> <p>At this price level, there\u2019s not a huge amount of difference between leading brands such as Asus, Dell, HP and Lenovo. It\u2019s best to visit a store such as John Lewis or PC Warehouse and check them for rigidity, keyboard quality, screen brightness and so on.</p> <h2><strong>Video editing</strong></h2> <p>Most people who dabble with video do some editing. It may be as simple as topping-and-tailing camera footage, grabbing clips from longer videos, joining clips together and adding titles, or converting videos between different formats (avi, mp4 etc). You can do things like this with almost any PC, but a slow machine will take much longer.</p> <p>In general, a video-editing PC should have the fastest processor you can get, the maximum amount of memory, and the fastest possible hard drive or, preferably, SSD. The minimum for serious work is 8GB of memory and a Core i5, but professionals would be more likely to go for a desktop PC with 16GB to 48GB of memory and a Core i7. Processor speed doesn\u2019t matter that much for word processing, email and casual web browsing, but it really does matter for video editing. It can be the difference between a 5-minute job and one that takes an hour.</p> <p>Of course, it depends what you\u2019re doing. You need a high-end or gaming laptop \u2013 or a desktop PC and a render farm \u2013 to process long, high-definition movies with lots of effects. You don\u2019t need anything that much power for editing YouTube videos. It\u2019s possible to produce acceptable results on a smartphone, or <a href=\"http://bestvideoediting.net/free-online-editors/\">you can edit videos online at YouTube and other websites</a>. But still, other things being equal, it\u2019s better to have a fast chip than a slow one.</p> <p>NotebookCheck has a <a href=\"http://www.notebookcheck.net/Mobile-Processors-Benchmark-List.2436.0.html\">Comparison of Mobile Processors</a> table online where you can find benchmarks for most current processors. You don\u2019t need to bother with the results: the chip nearest to the top of the list is probably the best. At the moment, for example, the Core i5-6200U is in 169th place, the M3-6Y30 is 311th and the Pentium N3700 is 484th.</p> <p>If two processors are on the same page on the table, there\u2019s probably not enough difference to worry about. If they are as far apart as those three, it matters.</p> <p><strong><em>Have you got a question for Jack?

It will be over.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/01/in-arizona-we-saw-the-real-donald-trump-the-one-we-already-knew\">In Arizona we saw the real Donald Trump: the one we already knew</a> </p> </aside>  <p>You may scoff at such promises, but this was no hyperbolic overstatement for the sake of a few votes. Trump assured us this speech would be different. \u201cToday, on a very complicated and difficult subject, you will get the truth,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Now unlike lots of other policy stuff \u2013 such as whether Russia has invaded Ukraine or whether you can really win a trade war with China \u2013 it\u2019s fair to say that Trump knows a thing or two about immigration. </p> <p>His first wife was born in the Czech Republic, and his third wife was born in Slovenia. His own family (original name: Drumpf) came from Germany, settling in the US a little more than a decade before the first world war.</p> <p>And yet, Candidate Trump proposed what he called \u201cideological certification\u201d of immigrants to check their real intent. That was the only way to weed out criminals and terrorists, who somehow blended into one giant alien blob in his combed-over cranium.</p> <p>Trump painted a portrait of a nation overrun by hordes of unassimilated aliens stampeding across the southern border, determined to butcher innocent Americans.</p> <p>Never mind that most undocumented immigrants enter the country by plane and overstay their visas. Never mind that Barack Obama has <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/obamas-deportation-policy-numbers/story?id=41715661\">deported</a> more people than any other president, and more than every president in the 20th  century combined.</p> <p>The US government apparently knows about all these criminal aliens, often detains them, but just keeps on releasing them back into society to wreak havoc. \u201cWe\u2019re like the big bully that keeps getting beat up,\u201d Trump lamented. \u201cDidya ever see that? The big bully that keeps getting beat up.\u201d</p> <p>No, we\u2019ve never seen that \u2013 except in one presidential candidate\u2019s recent trip to Mexico. <br></p> <p>Trump thinks of himself as a tough negotiator who knows the art of the deal. So when he travels to Mexico to confront the leader of a country that he thinks is ripping us off with bad trade deals, and sending its bad guys over the nonexistent border, we know exactly what to expect.</p> <p>A polite and friendly conversation that doesn\u2019t discuss his plan to force the Mexicans to pay for the wall he wants to build.</p> <p>This is clearly a cunning negotiation tactic. He has already confused the Mexican president, Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto, who told the world that Mexico would not pay for the Great Wall of Trump. \u201cI made it clear that Mexico will not pay for the wall,\u201d the president said bluntly.</p> <p>Trump himself had a different take. \u201cWe did discuss the wall,\u201d he said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t discuss payment of the wall. That will be for a later date. This was a very preliminary meeting. I think it was an excellent meeting.\u201d</p> <p>Other people hear \u201cno\u201d and think it means \u201cno\u201d. Other people negotiate by trying to move the other side closer to their own price. Other people speak up in a discussion. </p> <p>Not Trump. He negotiates by saying the discussion never happened. That\u2019s what \u201cvery preliminary\u201d means. An \u201cexcellent meeting\u201d is one where you lull the opposition into a false sense of victory.</p> <p>\u201cToday was the first part of the discussion, and a relationship-builder between Mr Trump and President Pe\u00f1a Nieto,\u201d said Jason Miller, a senior communications advisor to the nominee. \u201cIt was not a negotiation, and that would have been inappropriate.\u201d</p> <p>More appropriate was what came out of Trump\u2019s mouth when he returned to the land of the free. \u201cWe will build a great wall along the southern border,\u201d Trump told his cheering supporters in Phoenix, Arizona. At this point, he walked across the stage and applauded himself. </p> <p>\u201cAnd Mexico will pay for the wall. 100%. They don\u2019t know it yet, but they\u2019re going to pay for it.\u201d</p> <p>No, they clearly don\u2019t know it. But there were some clues left by some Trump staffers. As the candidate finished his speech, the loudspeakers played one track from his carefully curated campaign playlist.

  "<p>\u201cHope springs eternal\u201d, declared Alexander Pope in 1733. More than ever this year have I needed hope \u2013 and I found it, nestled in the pages of poetry.</p> <p>Earlier this summer, a word was hurled at me on the street by a stranger: \u201cLeave.\u201d Only one syllable and a second long, but it stayed with me. It was the day after the EU referendum results and in the two months since, racist incidents have been rising across the UK. Language itself seems to have been hijacked by toxic political discourse: small words such as \u201cleave\u201d, \u201cimmigrant\u201d, \u201cdemocracy\u201d, \u201cdecent\u201d, \u201chuman\u201d, and \u201creal\u201d have taken on sinister meanings. </p> <p>The word \u201creal\u201d was hijacked by Ukip, with Nigel Farage declaring Brexit a victory for \u201creal people\u201d. The title of a book on my shelf leapt out at me: <a href=\"http://www.bloodaxebooks.com/ecs/product/staying-alive-709\">Staying Alive: Real Poems for Unreal Times</a> (one of a trilogy of Bloodaxe poetry anthologies, alongside Being Alive and Being Human). Dehumanising language is designed to cause despair. But reading cast off the accumulated layers of false meaning around the words, and gave language back to me. Who and what is real, and who and what is unreal? Poets have long been grappling with these ideas, as in TS Eliot\u2019s haunting evocation of an \u201c<a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems-and-poets/poems/detail/47311\">Unreal City</a>\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIf we look to poets for anything at a time when abuse of power goes hand in hand with abuse of language,\u201d writes Neil Astley in the Staying Alive introduction, it\u2019s for \u201ctheir vigilance in defending and continually revitalising the language\u201d. Here there are voices from across history and around the world, translated from languages as various as Persian and Polish, speaking of love and loss, of finding hope in the midst of despair. There is Rumi (reminding us to \u201cWalk out like someone suddenly born into colour\u201d). There is Yeats (\u201c<a href=\"http://www.poemhunter.com/poem/he-wishes-for-the-cloths-of-heaven/\">I, being poor, have only dreams</a>\u201d). There is Langston Hughes (encouraging us to \u201c<a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.poets.org/poetsorg/poem/dreams\">hold fast to dreams</a>\u201d). Some of the most poignant poems speak of the search for a home, and are a timely reminder of the crisis of refugees throughout history, such as WH Auden\u2019s hugely powerful 1939 poem <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.poemhunter.com/poem/refugee-blues/\">Refugee Blues</a>:</p> <p>\u201cSay this city has ten million souls,<br>Some are living in mansions, some are living in holes:<br>Yet there\u2019s no place for us, my dear, yet there\u2019s no place for us.<br>[\u2026]<br>The consul banged the table and said,<br>\u2018If you\u2019ve got no passport you\u2019re officially dead\u2019:<br>But we are still alive, my dear, but we are still alive.\u201d</p> <p>Flowing through the lines of even the bleakest of poems is that assertion of life.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>The title resonates in a year where death has taken some of our finest. How to stay hopeful when we lose those whom we love? I recently experienced the loss of a loved one, and I turned to poetry as a life raft. Poetry buoyed me up from sinking into despair; I memorise short poems so I can hold the whole of them in my head, so I can conjure them to mind when walking down a dark, lonely street.</p> <p>As with all anthologies, it\u2019s a book that makes us turn to other books. So from these pages, I discovered other poems I loved, and many were filled with hope: </p> <p>\u201c<a href=\"https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems-and-poets/poems/detail/42889\">Hope is the thing with feathers</a> <br>That perches in the soul \u2014 <br>And sings the tune without the words \u2014 <br>And never stops \u2014 at all \u2014 \u201d, wrote Emily Dickinson in 1891. <br></p> <p>Astley writes: \u201cIn politics, television, newspapers and advertising, language is often negative, reductive, stripped of full expression to put across a message \u2013 it\u2019s spun or twisted out of recognition \u2026 Instead of being used to communicate, it is used to control thinking, as a tool of power.\u201d Poetry is the antidote to such abuse of words. </p> <p>As the first leaves of autumn fall, I won\u2019t leave these streets I call home. I won\u2019t give in to fear and despair, I\u2019ll stay, and stay alive.</p>",

  "<p>It\u2019s a billion pounds! Can you even imagine a billion pounds? What would a billion pounds actually look like in real life as opposed to spelled out in words on a yellow ticker? Is it enough to fill the swimming pool of a super\u2011agent\u2019s house or float down from several helicopters to cover a whole football pitch?</p> <p>Once upon a time, in the seasons that followed the 1992 Premier League rebrand, as everything around football ballooned, fuelled by a whirlwind of new money and new television deals and new players and managers and owners from the wider world, the discussion quite often turned to concerned debate about when the bubble would burst. Surely football would eventually eat itself. That was part of the conversation when Blackburn Rovers \u2013 now bottom of the Championship \u2013 won the league in 1995 financed by their lifelong supporter Jack Walker. That was central to the analysis when Leeds United \u2013 currently a fraction higher than Blackburn around the basement of English football\u2019s second tier \u2013 lived the dream, flew close to a Champions League final and were scorched.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2016/sep/01/13-players-who-broke-club-transfer-records-premier-league-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/5xype\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2692886\"            data-video-name=\"The 13 players who broke club transfer records in the Premier League \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57c83178e4b09a68e9b64ca2\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/09/01/160901transfers2_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/09/01/160901transfers2.m3u8\"/><source src=\"http://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11833823&amp;format=video/webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2016/sep/01/13-players-who-broke-club-transfer-records-premier-league-video\">The 13 players who broke club transfer records in the Premier League</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Yet, here we are in 2016 spending more than ever.

Tottenham Hotspur spent \u00a330m on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/aug/05/roberto-soldado-move-tottenham-hotspur\">Roberto Soldado</a> and City a similar amount <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/sep/01/premierleague.manchestercity\">on Robinho</a> without great returns. In the early Roman Abramovich years at Chelsea it was not unusual to be left with expendable talent that could not be easily resold, such as Hern\u00e1n Crespo, who was loaned out until he left for free.</p> <p>The Premier League, right now, is left resembling a footballing Brexit of sorts \u2013 the English clubs want to do business with clubs abroad but also have created their own market with its own overblown values. Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, whose background in economics gives him a specific insight into the machinations of football\u2019s finances, is unimpressed with this monster that generally requires Premier League clubs to pay over the odds. \u201cToday in Europe you have two markets, one for the English clubs and one for the rest of Europe,\u201d Wenger said recently. \u201cWhen the buyer is English that multiplies the transfer by two, three or sometimes by 10. If an English club does not come for a player he is worth \u00a35m. If an English club comes in he is worth \u00a335m, \u00a340m or \u00a350m.\u201d It makes the billion look a bit silly.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0f2ac85b2b785c584bb45489ec7192ec44234f67\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0f2ac85b2b785c584bb45489ec7192ec44234f67/0_180_7248_4347/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Eliaquim Mangala\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Eliaquim Mangala was among the expensive signings shunted out on loan by Manchester City on deadline day.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Xavier Laine/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The subplot of the great Premier League talent chase, though, concerns the problems that stem from buying expensively and adding a high-end salary, given the nature of transfers is that some just do not work out. What to do with the pricey mistakes, the no-longer-wanteds? The trouble with living in a separate market to the rest of Europe is that these problems are almost impossible to sell on for someone else to untangle.</p> <p>The Premier League clubs may have proved themselves lavish spenders but they are not in a position to be very good sellers. Once in a while a talent of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/sep/01/gareth-bale-real-madrid-tottenham\">Gareth Bale\u2019s quality</a> comes along to tempt Europe\u2019s finest clubs to part with vast sums. But in the main, finding ready buyers who are willing to take on Premier League wages for an out-of-favour player is like kicking a ball around while waiting for Godot.</p> <p>The billion-pound <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/transfer-window\">window</a> has clunked into the deadline day of the desperate season-long loan. Generally speaking, the instigators have been the clubs trying to streamline their squads and prune off the players who were always likely to be picked scarcely, if at all. It is one thing using the loan system as part of the business plan \u2013 as Chelsea have done in recent seasons. It is another to use it to develop young players. However, this summer there has been a shift, with so many clubs resorting to it to try to deal with complicated \u201cassets\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/31/arsenal-jack-wilshere-bournemouth-loan\">Arsenal\u2019s Jack Wilshere joins Bournemouth on season-long loan</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Among the loan deals for established players \u2013 rather than prospects \u2013 who have been farmed out this window are Arsenal\u2019s Wojciech Szczesny, Calum Chambers, Jack Wilshere and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/21/arsenal-joel-campbell-sporting-lisbon-loan\">Joel Campbell</a>.

Big wages are big wages across the Premier League.</p> <p>So here we are. Maybe the fact English clubs spent a billion in one transfer market excites you. Maybe it means something profound to the average Joe who loves their club and is pleased to have signed a player for an eye-watering sum as they strain to find the personal funds to cover their passion by buying match tickets, shelling out travel costs and paying satellite TV subscriptions. Maybe not. Maybe all is not quite so well in the weird booming world of Premier League transfers.</p>",

  "<p>In 2013, Brendon Chung\u2019s short, sharp game about a heist gone wrong, Thirty Flights of Loving, was listed as one of the finalists for the Narrative Award at the Independent Games Festival. Before that, the game had been discussed by critics as one of the \u201cvery best narratives\u201d in video games. Its use of the jump cut, borrowed from film-making, was a novelty, and Chung used it to great effect, tying together vignettes to tell a story that hurtled by with the kind of confident pacing that video games rarelyachieve.</p> <p>You might question, then, why Chung decided to move away from all this fanfare with his next game, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/aug/02/quadrilateral-cowboy-hacker-simulator-cyberpunk-blendo-games\">Quadrilateral Cowboy</a>. While working on it back in 2013, he told IGN that he \u201cwanted to go in a very different direction from Thirty Flights [of Loving] and let the player experiment in a sandbox and figure out their own solutions to problems\u201d.</p> <p>True to his word, when that game came out in July, it proved to be less narrative-focused than Chung\u2019s previous work. Quadrilateral Cowboy puts players in the role of three agents who attempt a series of break-ins into corporate facilities and office blocks. The game is played from the perspective of a computer hacker, meaning players have to input coding commands into their \u201cdeck\u201d to turn off cameras and security lasers, and open doors. Each level offers a number of different ways to achieve each goal, encouraging players to experiment with the gadgets at their disposal. These include a turret in a suitcase, a remote-control bug robot and a portable launch pad that makes crossing gaps a breeze. <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"317879b0f4039951f5dcabc6f7228afa3f0162e9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/317879b0f4039951f5dcabc6f7228afa3f0162e9/0_8_500_300/500.jpg\" alt=\"brendon.chung\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Brendon Chung</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There\u2019s a moment near the beginning of Quadrilateral Cowboy when the player has to collect the parts of a computer and assemble them. A data chip, power supply, hard drive and processor are all picked out of individual cabinets and inserted into a motherboard. The attention to detail here is remarkable, as the player is able to watch as each of the computer parts are wired up with loving animation. Chung couldn\u2019t help himself. \u201cThere is something comforting in being able to actually see mechanical pieces interlocking and moving together,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a clarity there. They\u2019re not hiding anything, everything is visible to the naked eye.\u201d Chung\u2019s affections for analogue technology is why Quadrilateral Cowboy is set during the 1980s and why he describes it as \u201c20th-century Cyberpunk.\u201d The point of this label is to signify the aesthetic and the era of technology that the game\u2019s world is set in: \u201cless touch-screen and more mechanical buttons and dials.\u201d</p> <h2>An appreciation of workmanship</h2> <p>Chung fostered his passion for analogue technology as a child growing up with it all around him. His interest in it now is a kind of nostalgia, but it\u2019s also more than that. It\u2019s what Chung identifies as an \u201cappreciation for workmanship\u201d. It\u2019s obvious where this came from: his dad. \u201cMy dad is one of those people who knows how to fix anything,\u201d Chung says. \u201cCarpentry, plumbing, automobiles, electronics \u2013 whatever you got, he can mend it, improve it, or salvage something from it.\u201d</p> <p>Chung grew up with his father, mother, and two siblings in a middle-class, three-bedroom house in Los Angeles. It was a creative household, with each member of the family having their own pursuits. Chung\u2019s dad submitted cartoons to newspapers as a kid, his mother is an avid musician, and his sister is now a graphics designer and illustrator. \u201cI work very hard to create my work, but whatever success I\u2019ve achieved wouldn\u2019t have been possible without my folks,\u201d Chung says. \u201cI think we\u2019re shaped by our environments, and I feel extremely lucky to have been surrounded by a lot of support.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fbe84fdb8de270212bf21a6729c59cee0a4b1d09\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fbe84fdb8de270212bf21a6729c59cee0a4b1d09/43_0_1280_768/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Quadrilateral Cowboy is a direct result of the environment that Chung grew up in\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Quadrilateral Cowboy is a direct result of the environment that Chung grew up in</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It\u2019s obvious that Quadrilateral Cowboy is a direct result of the environment that Chung grew up in. During his childhood, Chung\u2019s father would enlist the help of his children as he built cabinets from scratch, fixed a leaky pipe fixture, and snaked cables under the floorboards. Chung has memories of sitting behind the steering wheel and being told to push the gas pedal down to see what noise the car would make after his father had tampered with the engine.<br></p> <p>\u201cOne thing I learned was that whatever task you had at hand, there was absolutely always some hyper-specific tool that was the perfect fit for the job,\u201d he says. \u201cThat extremely specific thing you\u2019re trying to do? Yeah, there\u2019s an obscure tool built just for that. As a result, we had a garage full of power tools and hardware and equipment amassed over decades.\u201d</p> <p>That computer assembly scene in Quadrilateral Cowboy exists as a kind of love letter from Chung to technology then, but it also serves to draw the player into his mindset. \u201cEverything\u2019s just a pile of moving parts, and when you have the means of cracking them open, you get to see how those moving parts all play together,\u201d Chung says. \u201cI remember that electric feeling of seeing a panel held shut by plain ol\u2019 screws - that meant it was easy to open up, take a peek at its guts, and put it back together.\u201d</p> <p>If nothing else, Quadrilateral Cowboy is built to facilitate that \u201celectric feeling.\u201d Players are taught through repetition and intuition to see the literal nuts and bolts in the game\u2019s blocky environments, eager to open them up with their set of tools. They become like the childhood Chung, who built marble-roll roller coasters out of kebab sticks, and who had assembled a pile of WWII and Star Wars model kits. \u201cI remember loving kitbashing. Kitbashing is a term used in scale models, when you cobble together scrap parts from various model kits in order to make something,\u201d Chung said. \u201cThe original Command &amp; Conquer had come out and was the hot game, and I remember kitbashing together my own little Nod Buggy by scavenging pieces from various cars and planes.\u201d<br></p> <p>At university, this same passion lent itself to Chung\u2019s film projects. \u201cThe way I tended to work was I would look around my dorm room, take stock of what I happened to have with me, and then create a film project around those things,\u201d Chung says. \u201cAs a result, a lot of my projects revolved around the same crappy golf club and green winter jacket, over and over again.\u201d<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a013c293cf61b116300f148dfb7e58e400608498\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a013c293cf61b116300f148dfb7e58e400608498/0_21_1680_1008/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Quadrilateral Cowboy is a kind of love letter to technology\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Quadrilateral Cowboy is a kind of love letter to technology</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Quadrilateral Cowboy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The connection between his childhood toys and his university films is Chung finding ways to express himself through iteration and crude or mundane objects. It\u2019s this type of expression that Chung looks out for in the video games he plays, too. He\u2019s most fond of details such as a game letting its players rearrange the objects in a room, being able to sit down anywhere, or deciding whether to leave toilet seats up or down. \u201cOne of my favourite examples of this is in The Unfinished Swan,\u201d Chung said. \u201cIn that game you play as a child lost and alone in a strange world. It has a feature, not taught or mentioned anywhere during the game, where if you press the d-pad, it makes the kid say \u201cHello?\u201d \u201cAnyone there?\u201d \u201cHellooooooo???\u201d It has zero effect on the gameplay and it\u2019s just such a great way of letting you play a role.\u201d<br></p> <h2>Allowing players room for expression </h2> <p>It is no surprise that allowing players similar room for expression is one of Chung\u2019s goals when making his own games. It\u2019s this that he really wanted to dive into with Quadrilateral Cowboy and what he meant when saying that was taking it in a different direction from the narrative-directed Thirty Flights of Loving.<br></p> <p>The environments in Quadrilateral Cowboy are testament to this. One of Chung\u2019s rules when designing them was that if something looked interactable then it had to be. Whether is was a cupboard, light switch, or a window, everything had to allow players to fiddle with it. He also wanted there to be loose props that players could pick up and physically handle, rearranging the room carefully, or throwing everything around in disarray if they choose.<br></p> <p>Thirty Flights of Loving and Chung\u2019s other first-person games also contained this environment design philosophy. But where he goes further is with Quadrilateral Cowboy\u2019s heist missions. \u201cDuring the heists themselves, players are given free range on what kind of operative they\u2019d like to be,\u201d Chung said. \u201cSneak through like a ghost and don\u2019t leave a trace? Go for it. Snatch the vault and program your remote-control robotic rifle to shatter the second-floor window so you can leap out? Go for it. I\u2019m so delighted when people find creative ways to use the game mechanics to be themselves.\u201d<br></p> <p>Since the game has come out, Chung has also opened Quadrilateral Cowboy up for modding. This is possible due to the game being built in idTech4 (also known as the Doom 3 engine), which has a \u201cvery open structure,\u201d according to Chung. \u201cAll of its content files are just plain text files,\u201d he says. \u201cIf someone wished to open up one of the existing maps/items/whatever and see how it was implemented, they are free to do so. Additionally, the source code to the executable is open-source and available for download. So, just about everything in Quadrilateral Cowboy is modifiable.\u201d<br></p> <p>His hope is that people will take that liberty and conduct experiments to see how they can change the game. Perhaps someone will even go down the same path as Chung did, growing an interest in seeing how video games work, and then looking to make their own with the knowledge they acquire through toying with the code that holds them together. Chung would surely be thrilled with such an outcome.<br></p> <p>He encourages it, of course. \u201cAlways collect new tools, always crack things open and learn how people before you did it,\u201d Chung says.<br></p>",
  "<p>Under my hands were the hands of a midwife with years of experience, and under hers the head of a baby about to be born.</p> <p>I had never met the woman lying in the bed in the delivery room before, but she gave me the opportunity as a student nurse to experience childbirth with her. </p> <p>I was in my mid-twenties and had worked in hospital administration for a number of years. At this point I had completed the first year of my general nurse training: modules in care of elderly people, acute medical and surgical, and time in the operating theatre.</p> <p>It should have been nerve-racking but I knew my hands would be shadowing the midwife\u2019s, and fear turned to astonishment. I could sense through her hands the movement of the advancing baby. The midwife enabled this progress using just the right amount of guiding control. I had no fear, only anticipation.<br></p> <p>The labour was at an advanced stage \u2013 a small tuft of dark hair was visible. There was no time to discuss anything other than that this was her second pregnancy and her labour had been quick.</p> <p>The birth seemed more of a spiritual experience than anything I expected. The midwife gently encouraged the woman, with no sense of urgency but calmly and knowledgeably. You only heard a slight change in her tone and saw a hint of a nod to the labouring mother when effort was required. </p> <p>The midwife cradled the head of the child as he was born, while I stood at her side. It was a defining moment for me to feel the baby part from his mother and take that first gasp. It was as if I had delivered him myself, a moment forever etched in my heart and mind. Nothing else I could do would match the privilege of helping bring another human being into the world.</p> <p>It would be a number of years after this experience before I would deliver a baby by myself. I\u2019ve never forgotten how much this gentle birth helped influence my career path. That experience in a small rural midwifery-led unit was when I decided to become a midwife. The first day there sealed my future, and not only because I witnessed the birth of a baby. It was because the delivering midwife asked me to step forward. I had no idea what she was going to ask me to do. Having done my theatre experience I knew how to scrub up at least and that was all she asked of me. She was a natural mentor. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/healthcare-network/2015/jul/30/delivered-first-baby-incredible-midwife\">Last night I delivered my first baby. It didn't go to plan but it was incredible</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Once the baby was born I was allowed to hand the infant to his mother. We were left in awe in the hushed silence of the room. She gently felt him all over counting along with the midwifery sister the tiny toes and fingers. It was as if nothing else in the world existed other than mother and child. The mother cradled her son in her arms as he took his first feed from her. It was a scene of completeness and contentment.</p> <p>The usual depiction of a baby crying out was not so. The mother murmuring sweet words to her newborn son were calming and no one wanted to break the sense of wonder.</p> <p>Such hands-on experience changed my world as much as it did that mother\u2019s. Some 30 years on, she is likely to be a grandmother and that baby, a parent himself. To have been a part of that is profound.</p> <p>I went on to become a midwife in more clinical, acute hospital settings in bustling towns and larger cities. Yet I endeavoured to keep that gentle birth at the forefront of my practice. For in all we do, in our administering to the sick or healthy, there is no greater honour than stepping into another\u2019s life. </p> <p><em>If you would like to contribute to our <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/healthcare-network/series/blood-sweat-and-tears\">Blood, sweat and tears series</a> which is about memorable moments in a healthcare career, please read our <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/healthcare-network/2015/jul/14/healthcare-workers-tell-us-about-memorable-experience\">guidelines</a> and get in touch by emailing <a href=\"mailto:sarah.johnson@theguardian.com\">sarah.johnson@theguardian.com</a>.</em></p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/healthcare-professionals/?CMP=dis-166\">Join the Healthcare Professionals Network</a> to read more pieces like this.

Many, after a bit of head scratching, got Lloyd George. Rarely, however, could anyone put a name to the fourth figure, despite his having a fair claim to being the most successful peacetime prime minister of the 20th century. It is, of course, Clement Attlee.</p> <p>Perhaps we should not be surprised. Attlee was a modest man, lacking in charisma, an unimpressive public speaker, underestimated by friend and&#xa0;foe alike. Goodness knows how he would have survived on today\u2019s frenzied political scene (even at the time he was much criticised for his apparent lack of dynamism). Yet he presided for six years over a government whose legacy endures to this day.</p> <p>Everything about Attlee suggested a small-c conservative. Born in the late Victorian era, the son of a prosperous lawyer, educated at a leading public school (to which he remained attached for the rest of his life), a patriot with a distinguished war record, he could so easily have ended up on the other side. Destined to follow his father into the law, he opted instead to run a boys\u2019 club&#xa0;in the east London docklands and&#xa0;this was the experience that shaped his politics.</p> <p>One has to pinch oneself to recall that until little more than 100 years ago unemployment and old age often meant hunger, malnutrition and destitution. Destitution meant the workhouse and the dreaded means test. Death by starvation was not unknown in the early years of the 20th century. In the 1890s, when Attlee was growing up, only one child in 270 went into secondary education. In the pit villages of Yorkshire, the infant mortality rate was&#xa0;250 in every thousand \u2013 and this in&#xa0;what was then the richest and most powerful country in the world. Add to that the destruction and misery wreaked by the first world war and it\u2019s evident what propelled Attlee into politics.</p> <p>His rise was not at all predictable. Elected as the MP for Limehouse in 1922, he was a junior minister in the first Labour governments. As with most successful politicians, luck played a part. He might never have become leader but for the Labour split of 1931, which meant that, even four years later, competition for the top job was not as stiff as it might have been. Even then he might not have survived but for the outbreak of war and formation of a coalition in which he became deputy prime minister.</p> <p>Come the end of the war, he went on to lead a government which, in the teeth of almost insurmountable difficulties, established a comprehensive system of social insurance, providing unemployment pay, sickness benefit, maternity leave, widow\u2019s benefit, family allowances (child benefit) and a one-off death grant to help with funeral costs. It established the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/nhs\" title=\"\">National Health Service</a>, raised the school leaving age, and took into public ownership the coal industry, the railways, gas, electricity and the communications firm Cable and&#xa0;Wireless. In addition, it successfully demobilised more than 2 million men from the armed forces and began the dissolution of the empire. The government played a leading part in the foundation of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/nato\" title=\"\">Nato</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/unitednations\" title=\"\">United Nations</a> and even found time to set up the first national parks. All this was achieved against a background of a&#xa0;global economic crisis, confrontation with Stalin\u2019s Russia and a renewed outbreak of war in Korea. There has been nothing like it before or since.</p> <p>In this monumental biography, John Bew sets out to explore, not just the scale of the achievement (which others before him have done), but to discover what made Attlee tick \u2013 no easy task given the extraordinary reticence of his subject. He has looked at a vast array of sources, but one original feature is his use of the politician\u2019s correspondence (mainly with his brother) to discover what he was reading at any given time, and then to explore this material to get a&#xa0;sense of his mind.</p> <p>As a result many chapters include excursions into Attlee\u2019s reading habits, ranging from Edward Bellamy\u2019s novel <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/looking-backward-2000-1887.html\" title=\"\"><em>Looking Backward</em></a> and William Morris\u2019s <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/news-from-nowhere.html\" title=\"\"><em>News from Nowhere</em></a> to Kipling, Trollope and Gibbon (Attlee found time during his premiership to read all six volumes of <em>The</em> <em>Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire)</em>. He even tried his hand at writing a satirical novel \u2013 incomplete and unpublished. This is a good book about a remarkable man, but I remain unconvinced that Attlee\u2019s reading or writing habits tell us much that we don\u2019t already know. His beliefs were shaped by his work among the impoverished of the East End and the events through which he lived (two world wars and a great depression). He was a practical man, not a great thinker (many of the observations recorded in his letters to&#xa0;his brother are banal). To be sure, he&#xa0;was a patriot, but his was not the patriotism in which scoundrels take refuge: \u201cAttlee\u2019s patriotism meant not fidelity to caste or cohort, but to the commonwealth.\u201d He believed, too, that citizenship involved responsibilities as well as rights.</p> <p>These days, all sides in the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/28/corbyn-accuses-labour-officials-of-suspending-party-members-without-explanation\" title=\"\">fractious Labour party</a> claim to be heirs of Attlee but, as the author points out, there is \u201ca convenient element of amnesia in the exhumation of Attlee for modern political purposes\u201d. He faced no fewer than four attempts to force him out of the leadership and almost incessant criticism from within his own party, from both right and left. \u201cThe extent of the hostility shown towards him,\u201d Bew writes, \u201cshould caution us against the disingenuous myth-making around him today.\u201d</p> <p>For all his inscrutability, Attlee was not without a sense of humour. Witness the epitaph that he wrote for himself: \u201cFew thought he was even a starter, / There were many who thought themselves smarter. / Yet he ended PM, / CH and OM, / An earl and a Knight of&#xa0;the Garter.\u201d What matters more than the honours showered on him in retirement, of course, is the vastly more civilised world that he bequeathed to future generations.</p> <p>\u2022 Chris Mullin is a former Labour minister.

Rubbish collects in open sewers along the tight lanes of the neighbourhood and children mingle with tethered goats and chickens in the midday heat. It could be any poor community in the capital, but for the preponderance of wounds: missing toes, fingers, or entire limbs wrapped in white gauze. </p> <p>Allotted to people with the disease a half-century ago, these blocks in Tahir Pur have grown into Asia\u2019s largest leprosy colonies, home to 2,000 patients and their families, and a remnant of centuries of official policy to segregate them from the world. Rammurat arrived 25 years ago, seeking acceptance and access to treatment. \u201cI moved here to save myself,\u201d he says. </p> <p>A few hundred metres away is the Leprosy Mission\u2019s Delhi hospital, one of 14 specialist care centres the Christian group runs in India. Inside, hundreds crowd around waiting rooms and dispensary windows awaiting medicine, among them up to 150 leprosy patients each day.</p> <p>It diagnoses on average one new case of the disease per day. \u201cThat\u2019s alarming,\u201d says Stephen Levi, the hospital\u2019s superintendent. \u201cAnd when we ask them to bring their other family members in, they don\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>Beside psalms and lists of symptoms on the hospital\u2019s tiled walls there are, less congruously, pictures of the nine-banded armadillo: the north American mammal the only other species to naturally host leprosy, and a boon for researchers, who are still unable to grow the disease in labs. </p> <p>For all the fear it conjures, leprosy, caused by the pathogen <em>Mycobacterium leprae</em>, has been effectively treatable since the 1940s. It isn\u2019t particularly contagious either, its spread requiring regular contact with an untreated sufferer, and an immune system already compromised by genetics or poverty. Nor is it \u201cflesh-eating\u201d \u2013 limbs more likely to rot away because of injuries sustained by repeated use after the sensation of pain is lost. </p> <p>\u201cThe real problem is the level of stigma,\u201d says Dr Sunil Anand, the executive director of the Leprosy Mission. \u201cThose who get leprosy tend to be ostracised and stigmatised by the community, they tend to hide away.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9ef577a847cf3980c9e48c8a0c81786b2bf23d2f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9ef577a847cf3980c9e48c8a0c81786b2bf23d2f/0_329_6000_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Children work packing balloons in Tahir Pur, home to the largest leprosy colonies in Asia\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Children work packing balloons in Tahir Pur, home to the largest leprosy colonies in Asia</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Safi/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>That makes containing the disease, or treating it before disfigurement sets in, harder. \u201cDiscriminatory practices then come into play. Like schools not giving admission to children with leprosy, or from a leprosy family. It\u2019s the same in jobs, even healthcare,\u201d he says. </p> <p>About 16 national Indian laws still discriminate against people with leprosy, he says, a legacy of the ancient aversion to the disease, but also an 1898 colonial law that segregated patients and prevented them having children, passed in response to British panic an epidemic would spread back home.</p> <p>A eight-year treatment drive by the Indian government shrunk the number of new cases four-fold by 2005. That year the government celebrated the official elimination of the disease, meaning a rate of fewer than one in 10,000 new cases a year. \u201cMaybe that\u2019s possible,\u201d Levi, the hospital superintendent, says of the official rate. \u201cBut only because India has such a huge population.\u201d</p> <p>One of India\u2019s leading leprosy researchers, Dr Utpal Sengupta, is more sceptical. The elimination figure trumpeted by the government and World Health Organisation was produced \u201cin a hurry\u201d, the 75-year-old says from his office, a bobble-headed armadillo on the desk. </p> <p>More recent leprosy surveys produced by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) have a much greater prevalence, he says, but the Indian government has declined to release the exact estimate. (A source with access to the research told the Guardian the research showed a national rate of \u201croughly five to six cases per 10,000\u201d.)</p> <p>Battling high rates, health officials are also racing against time: leprosy strains are slowly becoming resistant to the multi-drug therapy that so successfully brought the Indian infection rate crashing down. </p> <p>\u201cWhen there was a monotherapy, it took only 30 years for the disease to develop resistance,\u201d Sengupta says. \u201cAnd we are already seeing resistance cases [for the multi-drug therapy].\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c75e710400be310041ea3dcec7ea29b66b566ccc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c75e710400be310041ea3dcec7ea29b66b566ccc/0_120_6000_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An aerial view of one of Tahir Pur\u2019s 29 leprosy colonies in east Delhi.

The opposition claimed that these constituted a \u201ccrime of responsibility\u201d. Rousseff denies this and claims the charges \u2013 which were never levelled at previous administrations who did the same thing \u2013 have been trumped up by opponents who were unable to accept the Workers\u2019 party\u2019s victory.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/DilmaRousseff/videos/1190517181001871/\">Speaking to her supporters</a> from the presidential palace after the vote, Rousseff pledged to appeal her impeachment, which she <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dilmabr/status/771052983966728193\">called</a> a parliamentary coup. The ousted president also called on her supporters to fight the conservative agenda now bolstered by her removal from office. <br></p> <p>\u201cRight now, I will not say goodbye to you. I am certain I can say, \u2018See you soon,\u2019\u201d she told supporters in Brasilia. </p> <p>In keeping with her pledge to fight until the end for the 54 million voters who put her in office, Rousseff \u2013 a former Marxist guerrilla \u2013 ended her presidency this week with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/29/brazil-president-dilma-rousseff-impeachment-trial\">a gritty 14-hour defence of her government\u2019s achievements</a> and a sharply worded attack on the \u201cusurpers\u201d and \u201ccoup-mongers\u201d who ejected her from power without an election.<br></p> <p>Her lawyer, Jos\u00e9 Eduardo Cardozo, said the charges were trumped up to punish the president\u2019s support for a huge corruption investigation that has snared many of Brazil\u2019s elite. This follows secret recordings of Romero Juc\u00e1, the majority leader of the senate and a key Temer ally, plotting to remove the president to halt the Lava Jato (car wash) investigation into kickbacks at state oil company Petrobras.</p> <p>While Rousseff was in the upper chamber, her critics heard her in respectful silence. But in a final session in her absence on Tuesday, they lined up to condemn her. As in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/18/dilma-rousseff-congress-impeach-brazilian-president\">an earlier lower house impeachment debate</a>, the senators \u2013 many of whom are accused of far greater crimes \u2013 clearly revelled in the spotlight of their ten-minute declarations. Reflecting the growing power of rightwing evangelism, many invoked the name of God. One cited Winston Churchill. Another sang. Another appeared to be in tears. </p> <p>\u201cI apologise to the president, not for having done what did, because I could not have done anything else, but because I know her situation is not easy,\u201d claimed a sobbing Jana\u00edna Paschoal, one of the original co-authors of the impeachment petition. \u201cI think she understands I did all this in consideration of her grandchildren.\u201d<br></p> <p>The result was never in doubt, though Workers\u2019 party figurehead and former president Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/04/brazil-ex-president-luiz-ignacio-lula-da-silva-interview\">who also faces a trial of his own</a> \u2013 had lobbied hard until the last moment to try to swing enough senators to avoid impeachment.</p> <p>At the end of the marathon 16-hour session of speeches, the final nail was hammered in by the former Brazilian footballer Rom\u00e1rio, who had been rumoured to be among the few senators who might change their minds and save the president. Instead, he wound up the debate by confirming that he would once again vote for impeachment. \u201cIt\u2019s a sad moment when you decide to remove a president,\u201d he told the chamber. However he said he was convinced that Rousseff had committed a crime of responsibility.<br></p> <p>Ahead of the verdict, senator Vanessa Grazziotin, of the Communist Party of Brazil, arrived with a sense of resignation. \u201cI\u2019ve worn a mixture of red [for the Workers\u2019 party] and black because today is a day of mourning,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m going to cry.\u201d However, she and other Rousseff allies hoped they could minimise Rousseff\u2019s punishment.<br></p> <p>Workers\u2019 party senator Lindbergh Farias said the president\u2019s accusers were cowards. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing how everyone who didn\u2019t have the gall to look Dilma in the eyes, spoke so bravely today in her absence,\u201d <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LindbergFarias/status/770700380242083840\">he tweeted</a>.</p> <p>The final result was comfortably more than the two-thirds (54 seats) needed to finalise the president\u2019s removal from office.</p> <p>Shortly after <a>1.30pm</a>, suspense filled the floor as senators watched as the upper house reached a quorum. Among the last to vote was the Workers Party\u2019s Jorge Viana as a hush fell across the packed room. There were cheers of \u201cBrazil!\u201d from the pro-impeachment camp as the numbers flashed up on the screen before a group of senators burst into a rendition of the national anthem. </p> <p>There were modest exchanges of \u201ccongratulations\u201d and backslapping between impeachment supporters as Juc\u00e1, who was drawn into the Lava Jato corruption scandal, said he was \u201crelieved\u201d by the result.</p> <p>Edison Lobao, of the PMDB, who voted for Rousseff\u2019s ouster, said: \u201cI couldn\u2019t have voted differently regardless of who was the president. I would have voted for the impeachment of any president who acted outside the law.\u201d</p> <p>The musician and democracy activist Chico Buarque, who was among Rousseff\u2019s supporters in the gallery, said the debate was rigged against her. \u201cIf the game were clean, she would have won,\u201d <a href=\"https://twitter.com/midianinja/status/770392899125063680?refsrc=email&amp;s=11\">he told local media</a>.</p> <p>Others noted that Rousseff\u2019s removal from office less than halfway through her mandate reinforced the impression that the country\u2019s political class remains uncomfortable with democracy although more than 30 years have passed since the end of Brazil\u2019s military dictatorship. Only two of the last eight directly-elected presidents have completed their terms. Two have been impeached, one removed in a military coup, one killed himself, one died before taking power and another resigned.</p> <p>It also marks a dramatic downfall of a woman who was once one of the world\u2019s most popular politicians with approval ratings of 85%. But she had struggled with a hostile congress and a dire financial climate. When Rousseff took office in January 2011, the economy was growing at a quarterly clip of 4.9%. <a href=\"http://saladeimprensa.ibge.gov.br/noticias?view=noticia&amp;id=1&amp;idnoticia=3245&amp;busca=1 \">It has been downhill ever since and she leaves the presidency with output shrinking by 4.6%</a> though this is partly because the price of Brazil\u2019s oil exports is now below half of its peak in 2011.</p> <p>Rousseff\u2019s achievements in office were mainly an expansion of equality policies put in place by her predecessors, particularly the <em>bolsa familia</em> poverty relief program, <a href=\"http://aplicacoes.mds.gov.br/sagi/RIv3/geral/relatorio.php#\">which now reaches almost 14 million households</a>. </p> <p>Thanks to affirmative action and wider access to higher education, university enrolments <a href=\"http://portal.inep.gov.br/superior-censosuperior-sinopse\">jumped 18% during her first term</a>. Since 2009, 2.6 million homes have been delivered by <a href=\"http://www.brasil.gov.br/infraestrutura/2016/03/minha-casa-minha-vida-chega-a-3a-fase-com-2-milhoes-de-novas-moradias-ate-2018\">the government housing program \u2013 <em>Minha Casa Minha Vida</em></a>. But her record in other key areas is mixed. After falling in her first two years in power, deforestation of the Amazon <a href=\"http://www.obt.inpe.br/prodes/index.php\">has started to rise again</a>. Her replacement has a lot to do.<br></p> <p>Temer \u2013 who was widely criticised for appointing an all-male, all-white cabinet when he took power on an interim basis in May \u2013 was sworn in again on Wednesday afternoon and is set to continue until the next presidential election in 2018, when he has promised he will not stand. </p> <p>After being sworn in, Temer promised a \u201cnew era\u201d for Brazil during a televised cabinet meeting. </p> <p>\u201cFrom today on, the expectations are much higher for the government. I hope that in these two years and four months, we do what we have declared \u2013 put Brazil back on track,\u201d he said. Regarding his upcoming trip to China, he said it was important to show that stability had returned. \u201cWe are traveling precisely to reveal to the world that we have political and legal stability,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to show that there is hope in the country.\u201d<br></p> <p>Temer received support from the United States, which implicitly rejected claims that Rousseff had been removed in a coup. US State Department spokesman, John Kirby said, \u201cWe are confident we will continue our strong bilateral relationship. This was a decision made by the Brazilian people and obviously we respect that ... Brazilian democratic institutions have acted within its constitutional framework.\u201d</p> <p>Shortly after the ceremony, he is due to fly to China to attend the G20 summit in Hangzhou, where he will hope to restore some of the credibility of an administration that has been battered by accusations of treachery and three ministerial resignations due to corruption scandals.<br></p> <p>He has promised to introduce austerity measures that will restore Brazil\u2019s credit ratings, which under Rousseff fell to junk levels. This is popular with investors, but not with the public. His approval ratings are only a fraction above those of his predecessor and he was roundly booed during the Olympic opening ceremony.<br></p> <p>During the final stages of the senate trial, there was no repeat of the mass rallies in Brasilia that marked earlier stages of the process. However, a small group of Rousseff supporters staged a candlelit vigil in the main esplanade. Bigger protests have been seen in other cities this week. In S\u00e3o Paulo anti-impeachment protesters and riot police <a href=\"http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2016/08/1808669-manifestantes-pro-dilma-entram-em-confronto-com-a-pm-em-sao-paulo.shtml\">clashed on Monday night</a>. Demonstrators claim the security forces made excessive use of tear gas and percussion grenades in what they fear will be a precursor of more clampdowns on opposition. Police claimed the protesters \u2013 many from the Landless Workers\u2019 Movement \u2013 blocked roads and detonated a home-made bomb.<br></p> <p><em>Additional reporting by Shanna Hanbury</em></p>",

Her intervention came as pressure groups within the Labour movement clashed in a war of words over the leadership campaign.</p> <p>Richard Angell, director of Progress \u2013 a Labour pressure group that is critical of the Corbyn membership and whose members are seen as Blairite \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.progressonline.org.uk/2016/08/31/asset-stripping-labour/\">has written an excoriating article for his group\u2019s magazine</a>.</p> <p>He accuses Momentum, a movement on the left of the party that is backing Corbyn, of planning to split Labour after September\u2019s election result.</p> <p>\u201cThis is not a party in a party, but a party waiting to leave a party,\u201d writes Angell in a message that will appear in his group\u2019s magazine on Thursday.</p> <p>\u201cJust look. Its national executive, trade union affiliations, membership processes, its conference alongside Labour conference and data on Labour members \u2013 harvested by the private companies set up to run Corbyn\u2019s leadership campaigns \u2013 all look like the precursor to an asset-strip of the Labour party.\u201d</p> <p>Angell said that it was a difficult and unpleasant time for \u201cmoderates\u201d in the Labour party. </p> <p>\u201cBut look how often the \u2018Mr Reasonable\u2019 mask slips from John McDonnell\u2019s face,\u201d he wrote about the shadow chancellor, before also claiming that when the party released a rights at work policy \u201cthe leader\u2019s office threatened in the media to sack party staff\u201d. </p> <p>The reference appears to be to the row between Corbyn and Labour\u2019s general secretary, Iain McNicol. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/01/jk-rowling-corbynites-twitter-row-labour\">JK Rowling and the Angry Corbynites \u2013 truly a Twitter row for our times | Ellie Mae O\u2019Hagan</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Angell suggested that Momentum was \u201cfrustrated that taking over the party is not as easy as it hoped. Why? Because members like you remember how proud you felt the day the national minimum wage became law and, at a stroke, 1.5 million people \u2013 two-thirds of them women \u2013 got a pay rise; because members like you want to see something similar again.\u201d </p> <p>He concluded that the Tories were bad enough to lose, but said Labour had to be good enough to win.</p> <p>He also criticised a new NEC member, Rhea Wolfson, for doing her first interview with Solidarity, the newspaper of Worker\u2019s Liberty, a socialist group banned by Labour in 1990, and for supporting \u201cmandatory reselections\u201d of MPs.</p> <p>Angell said he had originally invited Momentum to be a partner of Progress but was annoyed that it let in non-Labour members. \u201cIt should rule out any support for deselections or a change of the rules for mandatory reselection \u2013 you cannot debate the future of the party and country with a political gun to your head,\u201d he added.</p> <p>A spokesman for Corbyn\u2019s campaign said: \u201cWe would encourage Richard Angell to engage in a constructive debate rather than construct straw man arguments and indulge in personal attacks on his fellow members. It\u2019s regrettable, although expected, that Richard feels this way.\u201d</p> <p>He argued that Corbyn had reached out to all sections of the membership, citing a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/aug/31/corbyn-labour-leadership-yougov-poll-leadership-with-increased-majority-poll-suggests-politics-live?page=with:block-57c69c2fe4b0f6cb85628973#block-57c69c2fe4b0f6cb85628973\">YouGov poll</a> that gave the leader a huge lead over his rival, Smith.</p> <p>\u201cWe want to bring as many people into our party as possible to help us elect a Labour government,\u201d he added. \u201cBut we also want to be a pluralist and inclusive party, which is why Jeremy spoke at the Progress conference earlier this year.</p> <p>\u201cWe will continue to argue for the policies that will transform and rebuild Britain so that no one and no community is left behind.\u201d</p> <p>A Momentum spokesman said: \u201cMomentum is absolutely committed to pluralism within the Labour party and had invited Progress to run joint campaigns twice \u2013 on voter registration and in support of election candidates, offers that were refused on both occasions. It is also bizarre for Richard Angell to attack Rhea Wolfson for giving an interview to an organisation whose recent national conference was addressed by both Richard Angell himself and unsuccessful Progress-backed NEC candidate Luke Akehurst.\u201d</p>",

The multitude of things going on shows that multitasking comes naturally to her and she thrives on a busy schedule.<br></p> <p>Numerous separate doodles make up this crowded scene, reflecting readiness to take in new information and the rapid association of ideas of a lateral thinker, although there is logic, too, in the zigzag lines and angular shapes. However, heavy scribbling is a sign of frustration and retracing numbers suggests concern about costs or perhaps time passing.<br></p> <p>The spontaneous creation of this whole unique doodle shows she can think on her feet and come up with new ideas that perhaps challenge accepted practices. Unfortunately, it also suggests she is easily distracted and may not complete what she has started, so achieves best with short-term targets.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"ad9041195a2aafa470c5281003da8ab512af7bc7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ad9041195a2aafa470c5281003da8ab512af7bc7/0_118_383_479/383.jpg\" alt=\"paisley floral doodle with black biro\" width=\"383\" height=\"479\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2>Intuitive perfectionist</h2> <p>\u201c<em>All of my doodles are a variation of this paisley, floral pattern.

It\u2019s a very feminine doodle, full of feeling in the wavy lines and tear drops, and flowers in full bloom creating a happy mood.<br></p> <p>This person (probably a woman, but not necessarily) likes to work closely with others and will promote harmony in the workplace by avoiding conflict and creating a pleasant environment. She is sensitive, with an intuitive understanding of people and situations and is naturally accommodating, like the winding flower stems. Her evident delight in tiny decorative patterns shows she has a meticulous eye for detail and is capable of doing repetitive work requiring great precision or manual dexterity. However, being a perfectionist means she is unwilling to take short cuts so may not always be efficient and is likely to get stressed if put under pressure.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"be971079dc729351ded536adbbc4413d3c76d1cc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/be971079dc729351ded536adbbc4413d3c76d1cc/0_63_640_384/500.jpg\" alt=\"felt tip doodle of a grenade with a face\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2>Independent optimist</h2> <p>\u201c<em>A reaction to baffling requests or directives from clients.

Rapidly drawn in cartoon style with firm strokes softened by a felt-tip pen, it reflects this man\u2019s warmth and love of life as well as his lively intelligence, spontaneity, good physical coordination and self-assurance in action.<br></p> <p>With its grim but boyish humour this solitary, solid object shows he is independent, strong minded and not inclined to be pushed around. Rows of straight lines are a sign of systematic work and self-control, but the pointed tongue shows how rude he would like to be, while the crossed eyes and raised eyeline capture his disbelief and scepticism as he listens with one ear only, ready to pull the plug.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"846cbc6489c031362413af3f79a315b112b10ea2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/846cbc6489c031362413af3f79a315b112b10ea2/52_0_512_640/400.jpg\" alt=\"sad face doodle\" width=\"400\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2>Strong, mature and sensitive</h2> <p>\u201c<em>I\u2019ve always doodled while working.

A youth lost in comic books has resulted in a sketchbook full of random doodles \u2026 I should probably be a little concerned by the amount of slightly lost figures that turn up through my sketchbooks\u201d </em><em>\u2013 <a href=\"https://witness.theguardian.com/user/JimPOP\">JimPOP</a></em></p> <p>Working alone can be lonely, so when his pencil wanders it may be expressing feelings not consciously acknowledged. The face that emerged here is that of a strong, mature and sensitive man who appears to be reflecting on his life as he looks down through the years. To the right is a blank space, as if he would rather not think about the future. The expression is questioning and anxious, though the eyes are partially obscured, suggesting he may be reluctant to see this in himself. The lips, too, are shaded and hardly open, as if experience has taught him the wisdom of discretion, especially in business.<br></p> <p>Strong men avoid showing weakness but in later life may find themselves more in touch with their feminine side as they have less to prove. Crossed and circular patterns represent opposite personality traits, so the presence of both in the background suggests this process may have begun.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"6e90822176c6891a976c0cdb6476a138873327d9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6e90822176c6891a976c0cdb6476a138873327d9/2_68_545_327/500.jpg\" alt=\"spiky drawing\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2>Calm, collected and determined to succeed </h2> <p><em>\u201cStill thoughts\u201d \u2013 <a href=\"https://witness.theguardian.com/user/elestial\">elestial</a></em></p> <p>This doodle grew slowly, line by line, creating a form that took on a life of its own, like an exotic plant or strange bird. It took a steady hand to draw this, most probably a woman\u2019s as curves represent typically feminine traits.<br></p> <p>Cool, calm and collected is how she is likely to appear, judging by this beautifully smooth and self-contained drawing. The exceptional control and finesse in this elegant, formal design shows she has high standards and likes to be in control, so takes great pains over preparation and presentation. The sharp points and fine lines dissecting the interior indicate that she has a keenly critical, analytical mind and demands much of herself. And the exterior beak-like shapes, with their dark shading hinting at underlying aggression, show she is determined to succeed.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"1b99c6b744eaf17f97221bcd6d10424e27a5d12d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1b99c6b744eaf17f97221bcd6d10424e27a5d12d/79_44_422_528/400.jpg\" alt=\"joybranigan\" width=\"400\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2>High intellect introvert</h2> <p>\u201c<em>It starte</em><em>d with the central square when I started my working life 27 years ago and has developed since then\u201d \u2013 <a href=\"https://witness.theguardian.com/user/joybranigan\">joybranigan</a></em></p> <p>A highly developed intellect is indicated by this constellation of triangles and stars that appears to float in space. It shows exceptional clarity of thinking, ability to understand abstract concepts and good powers of reasoning, analysis and organisation. The straight lines and heavy infill indicate she also has strong willpower, but can lack flexibility.<br></p> <p>The integral spaces reflect the active inner life of an introvert who must have space to think and work. Dealing with people is not her strong point, but the growth of an outer ring to her doodle suggests she has widened her social circle.<br></p> <p>Triangles show energy and drive being channelled into work and achievement, but compression in the top right \u201conwards and upwards\u201d area shows tension associated with her career. Whether she is being held back or is holding herself back is unclear, but a clue may lie in the inner square which suggests security is still a concern for her.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"8d70ee857c54dc36d3a69d37f9614c35312807c4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8d70ee857c54dc36d3a69d37f9614c35312807c4/0_2_509_636/400.jpg\" alt=\"flower doodle\" width=\"400\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2>Cheerful, confident and proud team player</h2> <p>\u201c<em>This doodle was during a recent, long telephone confere</em><em>nce call.

Flowers relate to people and rings of petals to social circles, so these groups of three and six may represent her family or team. The cheerful mood, upright stems and rising shape of the arrangement reflect self-confidence and pride in her family or achievements, while the balanced spacing is a sign of good teamwork.<br></p> <p>The orderly line of waves shows deep feelings kept well under control, persistence in the face of adversity and a strong sense of responsibility, but the butterflies suggest she would also like to be free to enjoy herself.<br></p> <p>Squares relate to material security and boxes to organisation and planning, so this tier of boxes suggests her career is very much part of her plan for the future. The variety of shapes they contain shows some mixed feelings, but her high hopes are reflected in the largest flower that resembles a shining sun.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"2dcabe5b0b93eb8bc0e6ac0114de4f4f8991d6a7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2dcabe5b0b93eb8bc0e6ac0114de4f4f8991d6a7/35_27_510_306/500.jpg\" alt=\"health insurance doodle\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2>Stressed and hungry for more rewarding work</h2> <p>\u201c<em>I work in a call centre for a health insurance company.

The roughly crossed mouth expresses their frustration and rage, the drooping moustache their despondency, the stitched-up cuts their scars and the haunted eyes their pain.<br></p> <p>Their pen goes round and round in circles as this person listens to the same sorry stories, but it helps their concentration as they diligently persist with repetitive tasks. Nevertheless, the large head with eyes looking up suggests they have confidence in their abilities, so are setting their sights on a higher position for themselves. Drawing off the top of the page shows they feel limited and want to break into something new. At the moment this stress is finding an outlet in this disturbing doodle, but it may also be prompting them to take action to find more rewarding work.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"bf1f72c35c6a07bf2aed7a58ba470bef56ad3914\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bf1f72c35c6a07bf2aed7a58ba470bef56ad3914/0_23_640_384/500.jpg\" alt=\"eye doodle\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2>Optimistic but frustrated and looking for new challenges</h2> <p>\u201c<em>The most common thing for me to d</em><em>raw is an eye or pair of eyes.

There is optimism in this bright eye, but sadness in its dark colour and lines beneath, frustration in the roughly drawn upper lashes and anxiety in the peripheral shading. She may feel overlooked and want the opportunity to shine.<br></p> <p>The rapid, simple sketch of a broad nose and closed mouth shows her intelligence, discretion, drive and efficiency in being able to recognise what is essential and prioritise. The holly with its cluster of berries, soft prickles and extended leaves suggests she has an affectionate nature as well as a sharp mind, and may be looking out for something more challenging and enjoyable to do.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"eb115be9df7a93cf7f40ca520cd5f7686f36d963\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eb115be9df7a93cf7f40ca520cd5f7686f36d963/25_0_600_360/500.jpg\" alt=\"blue biro doodle\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2>Diligent but restless</h2> <p>\u201c<em>This doodle started small and simple, but grew little-by-little with every client call.

This carefully worked drawing with its smooth unbroken lines shows great concern over presentation and correctness, with close attention to finer points and details. Patterns of checks and parallel lines indicate that routine work is approached diligently and tasks carried out in a disciplined, methodical way.<br></p> <p>However, the movement in the waving tentacles and lively variety of patterns suggest this person is also restless and finding work dull, so is putting out feelers and considering options. The horn shape rising to the edge of the page shows ambition and desire to move on, but the coils turning this way and that reflect mixed feelings and uncertainty as to which direction to take.</p> <p><strong>Looking for a job?

  "<p>In the Samburu National Reserve in northern Kenya, when the fierce heat of the sun has softened into a gentle evening glow, David Daballen and I climb into a jeep to find some elephants.<br></p> <p>As we drive through the savannah, Daballen, a conservationist at Save the Elephants, points out family groups and individuals within them. \u201cThese are the Butterflies, this group is Storms, here are the Spices,\u201d he says. We have been looking out for Cinnamon, the Spices\u2019 matriarch, and suddenly there she is: around 50 years old, huge and tuskless, having been born without any precious ivory. Close to her is Habiba, who was orphaned along with seven siblings when poachers killed their mother in 2011. The orphans were adopted by Cinnamon and the rest of the Spices.<br></p> <p>Daballen reckons he can identify and name between 400 and 500 elephants. In the jeep, he keeps up a stream of names. \u201cThat\u2019s Jonathan,\u201d he says as we spot an elephant\u2019s rear end, some 50 metres away. How can he tell one from another? \u201cLook at their ear patterns: the nicks and holes and tears. Look at their tusks: some are short, some are long, some are curved, some are straight. Look at the pigmentation: some have pink skin, some are light, some are dark. But also look at their faces. They are like our faces, every one is individual.\u201d It\u2019s not just physical characteristics that are distinguishing, he adds. \u201cWhen you spend time with elephants you understand they all have different personalities. They get into your mind. I probably know more elephants than people.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--immersive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/2015/08/cabinet-lifts/embed/index.html?vid=0&amp;amp;url=https://cdn.theguardian.tv/interactive/2016/08/26/160826Elephant1_V3_4M_vp8.webm\" data-alt=\"Rollover to play video\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/2015/08/cabinet-lifts/embed/index.html?vid=0&amp;url=https://cdn.theguardian.tv/interactive/2016/08/26/160826Elephant1_V3_4M_vp8.webm\">Rollover to play video</a> <figcaption>\u2018When you spend time with elephants you understand they all have different personalities,\u2019 says Daballen.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>One of Daballen\u2019s colleagues tells me later that the recognition and respect is mutual. \u201cThe elephants trust him, they will come to him,\u201d she says. Indeed, one evening our jeep, parked with the engine switched off, is surrounded by a dozen elephants, nudging against the vehicle, trunks nosing almost under our tyres to find clumps of grass, their eyes slowly blinking as they meet ours. It\u2019s a magical moment.</p> <p>After the group moves on, we drive back though near-darkness without headlights. Daballen navigates the jeep between thorn bushes and over furrows, guided by a rising moon and his intimate knowledge of the terrain.</p> <p>At 36, Daballen has spent 16 years working for <a href=\"http://savetheelephants.org/\">Save the Elephants</a> (STE), and the 20 years before that living among them and other wild animals in the village of Marsabit, some 200km north of Samburu. When he was a child, he tells me, \u201cthere were a huge number of elephants up there, but they\u2019ve been devastated by poaching.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"80ae82f003758760ed7f8acad05ec869c65ad509\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/80ae82f003758760ed7f8acad05ec869c65ad509/0_306_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Samburu National Reserve\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">In 1800 there may have been 26 million elephants in Africa alone.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He would often encounter the animals walking to and from school, or while herding his father\u2019s cows and goats. \u201cEvery other day we would be chased by elephants. At first it was frightening, and then it became a game,\u201d he recalls. \u201cI grew up close to them. Wildlife was part of us, part of our lives.\u201d</p> <p>After finishing high school, he went to join his older brother, who was by then working for the Kenya Wildlife Service in Samburu. One day Daballen saw a jeep with a Save the Elephants logo on the side. Curious, he discovered the organisation researched elephants \u2013 how they live, and how they die.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>They are a crucial part of the ecosystem, and an iconic species.

Then it was just two tents and a vehicle \u2013 almost nothing. I spent two months with them, then two months became four months, and four months became a year, and then they never let me go.\u201d Now, he adds, \u201cI think it\u2019s very likely I\u2019ll spend my life doing this.\u201d</p> <p>During Daballen\u2019s time at STE, the tents have become a cluster of rudimentary eco offices, communal areas for meeting and eating, and cabins for sleeping. The one vehicle has become a fleet of battered jeeps and a Cessna 185 for aerial surveillance and transport across the vast tracts of savannah and hills in northern Kenya. Daballen the intern has become head of field operations, and an eloquent ambassador for the elephants of Samburu.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"46efd215d9c967de02f24a53f3cffd04b81f1613\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/46efd215d9c967de02f24a53f3cffd04b81f1613/0_406_5976_3586/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Samburu National Reserve\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Conservationist David Daballen says he can name up to 500 elephants in the Samburu reserve.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graeme Robertson</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Back at the research station, he elaborates on his love of the creatures. \u201cI\u2019ve learnt so many things from them. The love and compassion they have for one another. Human love is very conditional, but theirs is unconditional. They are so close, they really care for one another \u2013 better than humans in many ways. The energy and excitement they show when they meet family members, even after a short period. It\u2019s like they\u2019re saying, \u2018oh my god, where have you been?\u2019 They are clever, intelligent creatures. They can navigate over huge distances and remember their routes and safe places. They mourn their dead. They are a crucial part of the ecosystem, and an iconic species.

A phone call from the rangers\u2019 commander quickly followed. His message: poachers are shooting elephants, bring reinforcements.</p> <p>Daballen and his colleagues immediately rushed to STE\u2019s research camp in Samburu. As the word spread quickly through the wildlife protection network, rangers and anti-poachers from the local community gathered, ready to help. Among them was Chris Leadismo, the organisation\u2019s military-trained security liaison officer.</p> <p>Leadismo and six others, armed with G3 automatic rifles, headed south. Knowing the poachers would hear the vehicles approach, they left their jeep on a dirt road and continued in silence, pausing periodically to listen.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"70f2b24d294f9262ab46584502ddae0236fd6081\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/70f2b24d294f9262ab46584502ddae0236fd6081/0_0_5976_3992/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Elephant skull Kenya\" width=\"1000\" height=\"668\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Around 100,000 elephants were killed for their ivory between 2010 and 2012.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graeme Robertson</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThe rangers were crawling through the grass, inching forward, lying still, taking one more step, lying still. It\u2019s a game of who sees who first \u2013 and it was now getting dark,\u201d says Daballen. Two groups of heavily armed men, a herd of threatened elephants, poor visibility; danger was all around.</p> <p>The poachers had separated a big bull elephant with long valuable tusks from the females. As the terrified females fled, another six shots rang out. \u201cThe rangers could hear the bull making death sounds \u2013 a loud rumble. Then they saw him. He was standing, but barely,\u201d says Daballen.</p> <p>Using night vision binoculars, Leadismo could see blood pouring from the bullet wounds in the elephant\u2019s head and body. \u201cHe was full of blood, it was everywhere,\u201d he says.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The rangers could hear the bull making death sounds \u2013 a loud rumble</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The poachers and the rangers were aware of each other\u2019s presence and knew that any movement could start a gunfight. The night crept on in wary limbo.</p> <p>\u201cThe guys are lying on the ground in pitch black, not moving, not talking, no torches \u2013 nothing,\u201d says Daballen. \u201cIt\u2019s very dangerous out there at night. Then suddenly one of the rangers was bitten by a scorpion, and he cried out. That was the poachers\u2019 luck.\u201d In the commotion and darkness, the villains made their escape.</p> <p>By then, Koitelel, a 30-year-old elephant, was dead with 16 bullet wounds in his carcass. The rangers carefully removed his tusks for safe storage and left his body for the hyenas. <br></p> <p>Now, two years later, Koitelel\u2019s bleached skull and bones still lie scattered amid the thorn bushes, a poignant memorial to an Africa-wide orgy of elephant killing, which some believe is threatening the very survival of the species.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"040c2f0b904a5e3ec2abf1f4a0af9096cdc729c7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/040c2f0b904a5e3ec2abf1f4a0af9096cdc729c7/0_0_5760_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Elephants at the Samburu National Reserve\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Last year, more elephants were killed for their ivory than were born.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graeme Robertson</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>The ivory conflict</h2> <p></p> <p> </p> <p>Across the continent, elephant poaching is happening on an industrial scale. According to the shocking results of <a href=\"http://www.greatelephantcensus.com/\">one study</a>, released today, the population of savannah elephants declined by 30% between 2007 and 2014. There are roughly 400,000 savannah elephants left and that number is falling by 8% per year. </p> <p>Vulcan\u2019s* Great Elephant Census gathered detailed statistics over two years by flying over and counting herds of elephants as they roam the plains beneath. Dead elephants are counted too. A \u201ccarcass rate\u201d (the ratio of living to dead) of more than 8% indicates poaching at a high enough level to cause the population to decline. In Mozambique and Angola, the rate was more than 30%. Among Cameroon\u2019s small elephant herd it was 83%. </p> <p>Other research has come up with similarly bleak findings. A 2014 <a href=\"http://www.pnas.org/content/111/36/13117.abstract\">scientific study</a> estimated that 100,000 elephants were killed for their ivory between 2010 and 2012.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/08/african-zip/giv-31075WSwAfLYQv9GT/\" data-alt=\"Current range of African elephants\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/08/african-zip/giv-31075WSwAfLYQv9GT/\">Current range of African elephants</a> </figure>  <p>The rest of Africa\u2019s elephants are forest elephants and they are by definition harder to count. Another <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/31/african-forest-elephants-extinction-study\">study released this week</a> found these creatures to be one of the slowest reproducing mammals. Even if poaching stopped tomorrow, it might take 90 years for forest elephants to recover to their 2002 population.</p> <p>\u201cThis is largely due to poaching,\u201d says Chris Thouless, a conservationist who works with STE as a strategic adviser and who contributed to the status report. We meet over tea and home-baked cookies at his house overlooking the Borana private reserve, 10 minutes\u2019 flying time south of Samburu. </p> <p>Like diamonds and other valuable minerals, ivory is at the heart of a conflict over Africa\u2019s natural resources; a war prosecuted by organised crime syndicates motivated by the enormous profits to be made from illegal poaching, smuggling and trading.<br></p> <p>In the early years of this conflict, demand for ivory came mainly from Europe, America and Japan, fuelling a genocide that saw the African elephant population fall from a conservative estimate of 1.3 million in 1979 to less than half that within a decade. Some 700 tonnes of mostly illegal ivory \u2013 the <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/23504364_Banking_on_extinction_ivory_storage_and_elephant_conservation\">equivalent of tusks from about 70,000 elephants</a> \u2013 were leaving Africa each year, most of it heading for China to be processed and re-exported to markets elsewhere.</p> <p>But in 1989, the <a href=\"https://www.cites.org/\">Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species</a> (Cites) banned ivory trading, and the next 15-20 years saw a hiatus in the elephant slaughter. The population showed incipient signs of recovery.</p> <p>Ten years ago, however, the killing started again, this time stoked by rising demand in China itself as a result of its booming economy and its burgeoning moneyed elite. Now China is the end destination for 70% of illegal ivory; its price tripled between 2012 and 2014, reaching a peak of $2,200 (\u00a31,675) per kilo.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It\u2019s not like the battle has been won \u2013 the threat is still very real \u2013 but it\u2019s not on the scale of a few years ago</p> <footer> <cite>Chris Thouless</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In some countries the slaughter has reached an obliterative scale.

In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the elephant population has been almost eliminated. Central African Republic has lost almost all its savannah elephants. Sudan, Zimbabwe and Gabon are among countries that have seen widespread killing. Last year, some 20,000 elephants were being killed for their tusks in Africa \u2013 more than were born. In Asia, the other great homeland for elephants, it\u2019s estimated that <a href=\"http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/7140/0\">fewer than 50,000 remain</a>, a decline of 50% in the past 100 years.

It\u2019s not like the battle has been won \u2013 the threat is still very real \u2013 but it\u2019s not on the scale of a few years ago.\u201d</p> <p>And, he adds, although elephant killing is down in Kenya, the country is still a key component in the smuggling routes out of Africa to Asia. \u201cSome of the biggest smuggling networks are based in Kenya. [The port of] Mombasa remains a huge suction point for ivory, particularly from Tanzania.\u201d</p> <p>There are a number of intertwined reasons why poaching has been contained in Kenya over the past two years. A key global factor is the slump in the price of raw ivory in China following an agreement signed jointly by the US and Chinese presidents in September 2014, pledging to end the ivory trade and as a result of the faltering Chinese economy. The price per kilo has fallen from $2,200 to $1,100 \u2013 although, says Thouless, it is still at a level \u201cwe\u2019d have been horrified at five years ago\u201d and \u201cit hasn\u2019t come down enough to act as a deterrent\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"bda7cbb463fca9658520bfca029d17186fe043cd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bda7cbb463fca9658520bfca029d17186fe043cd/0_406_5976_3586/1000.jpg\" alt=\"schoolchildren Nasuulu\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cooperation between local communities and conservationists is vital to preserve elephants.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graeme Robertson</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But local changes have been hugely significant. The Kenyan government has shown a political will to act against poachers and enforce justice. In April, the Kenyan president, Uhuru Kenyatta, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/apr/30/kenya-to-burn-largest-ever-ivory-stockpile-to-highlight-elephants-fate\">ceremonially burned more than 100 tonnes of extremely valuable ivory</a>; in July, syndicate leader <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-kenya-crime-poaching-idUSKCN1021YT\">Feisal Mohamed Ali was sent to prison for 20 years and fined $200,000</a>. Public opposition to the ivory trade has grown, and cooperation between conservationists and local communities has had a dramatic impact.</p> <p>This last factor is crucial, says David Daballen. Persuading nomadic communities and local farmers of the merits of conservation has, he says, taken time. In nearby Nusuulu, where ivory poaching was rife a few years ago, it took a year to persuade elders from four tribes to come together and agree to create a conservation area on their land. \u201cIt means sitting under a tree for days and days and days \u2013 people talking, yelling, fighting \u2013 until sense prevails,\u201d says Daballen.</p> <p>Since the Nasuulu conservancy was created in 2011, large-scale elephant killing has stopped, security has improved and inter-tribe conflict has declined. A dozen or so local men are employed as rangers, scouts or drivers. Software is being developed to warn farmers when elephants are close so they can protect crops. STE has launched a scholarship programme for bright children in Nasuulu and other local conservancies. And, a mobile education unit leads classes and field trips to teach children how people and elephants can and should coexist in harmony.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"fde1545635a1ad7810b2d37e07cc962ee179d070\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fde1545635a1ad7810b2d37e07cc962ee179d070/0_241_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Samburu National Reserve, elephants in the river\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Samburu National Reserve is situated on the banks of the Ewaso Ng\u2019iro river in Kenya.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graeme Robertson</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>A humbling effect</h2> <p>On my last day we take to the air. Iain Douglas-Hamiliton settles in behind the controls of STE\u2019s four-seater Cessna, trimmed with the family tartan, and gives the plane\u2019s call sign \u2013 \u201cfive yankee sierra tango echo\u201d \u2013 to other pilots who might be in the sky. In less than a minute we\u2019re airborne over Samburu and the neighbouring reserve, Buffalo Springs, scanning the savannah below for elephants.</p> <p>The plane is used to monitor and track elephants in a complementary operation to the ground excursions. In Samburu, 60 elephants have been tranquillised \u2013 in often difficult circumstances \u2013 to allow loose collars with GPS devices to be fitted, making these northern Kenyan elephants the most closely monitored in Africa. The signal is beamed to a satellite and back to STE\u2019s research camp, giving regularly updated locations for the elephants which are transmitted via an app to the staff\u2019s phones and tablets.</p> <p>But Douglas-Hamilton has accidentally left his phone on the ground, so we are freewheeling over the savannah, relying on our eyes. He points out an area vacated by a group of nomads to allow the elephants free range. \u201cThese sorts of compromises are essential between elephant and man,\u201d he says. When we spot a group of elephants, Douglas-Hamilton executes a stomach-heaving turn to get a closer look. He wants to note where they are, how many are in the group, which family it is, how close they are to water, livestock and people.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--showcase\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/2015/08/cabinet-lifts/embed/index.html?vid=0&amp;amp;url=https://cdn.theguardian.tv/interactive/2016/08/30/160826Elephant6_h264_mezzanine_4M_vp8-1.webm\" data-alt=\"Rollover to play video\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/2015/08/cabinet-lifts/embed/index.html?vid=0&amp;url=https://cdn.theguardian.tv/interactive/2016/08/30/160826Elephant6_h264_mezzanine_4M_vp8-1.webm\">Rollover to play video</a> <figcaption>Though poaching is a major issue for elephants, urbanisation poses another risk to their survival.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>At 74, Douglas-Hamilton has devoted his life to elephants. After studying zoology at Oxford he moved to Tanzania, and later to Kenya. In the 1970s and 80s, he began aerial surveys of Africa\u2019s elephant population, revealing the shocking scale of poaching. He founded <a href=\"http://savetheelephants.org/about-ste/\">Save the Elephants in 1993</a>.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve focussed on elephants all my working life. But you also have to get deeply interested in politics, community issues, human welfare \u2013 because man is the most important determinant of the elephant\u2019s future,\u201d he says. Ensuring a future for elephants and their environment means creating positive co-existence between humans and elephants \u2013 and this will become increasingly important with the exponential growth of the human population across the continent, which is <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-34188248\">expected to double to 2.5 billion between now and 2050</a>.</p> <p>His brother-in-arms Thouless also expounds on the relationship between the growing population and economies of African countries and its wildlife. As conservationists, he says: \u201cWe may have to curb our ambitions. It\u2019s not just the increased number of people, it\u2019s also the increased footprint of those people as you get economic development. Poaching dominates our thoughts, but the implications of plans for transcontinental railways, roads and pipelines are massive.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Elephants have a humbling effect on humans; they make us realise that perhaps we are not the masters of the universe</p> <footer> <cite>Chris Thouless</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fcbff779240035521984a458319988a1877dc0cc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fcbff779240035521984a458319988a1877dc0cc/0_0_5760_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"elephant foot\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018We\u2019re in danger of throwing away three billion years of evolution.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graeme Robertson</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIt may be unrealistic to expect vast untrammelled landscapes across which elephants can move freely.

There was no softening. There was just Donald Trump.</p> <p>In Trump\u2019s much heralded immigration speech, the Republican nominee finally put to rest any pretense that he would moderate his views for a general electorate. \u201cThere will be no amnesty,\u201d Trump proclaimed to a cheering crowd.</p> <p>He seemingly went further than that, making clear that he opposed so-called \u201ctouchback amnesty\u201d, under which qualifying illegal immigrants could return to their home countries to apply for an expedited path to legal status: \u201cThose who have left to seek entry under this new system will not be awarded surplus visas, but will have to enter under the immigration caps or limits that will be established.\u201d<br></p> <p>The speech came after Trump had spent weeks hinting at a \u201csoftening\u201d. He even seemed to indicate in an interview with Fox News\u2019 Sean Hannity last week that <a href=\"https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/us-news/2016/aug/24/donald-trump-immigration-reform-sean-hannity-fox-news\">he might support a path to legal status</a> for undocumented immigrants, though he quickly <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/08/25/politics/trump-no-legal-status-for-undocumented-immigrants/\">backed off</a> that statement.</p> <p>There were even signs of a moderate tone earlier Wednesday when Trump <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/31/donald-trump-mexico-meeting-president-pena-nieto-immigration\">met with Mexican president Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto</a> on a surprise visit to Mexico City. At a press conference with Pe\u00f1a Nieto, Trump was restrained and talked about illegal immigration as a humanitarian crisis.</p> <p>It\u2019s clear now that the debate is over. There will not be a more moderate Trump, there will not be a more compassionate Trump. Instead, the same candidate who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/16/donald-trump-announces-run-president\">warned the day he announced his run</a>, \u201cWhen Mexico sends its people, they\u2019re not sending their best \u2026 They\u2019re bringing drugs.

It\u2019s pretty long. Here are just a couple:</p> <h2><strong>On people illegally in the US</strong></h2> <p><strong>Trump</strong>: \u201cThey\u2019re treated better than our vets.\u201d</p> <p><strong>The facts:</strong> People in the country illegally do not have the right to work, vote or receive most government benefits. A modest number have been exempted from deportation because of an Obama administration action, but most live under the risk of being removed from the country.</p> <p>Veterans are guaranteed government health care and because almost all are citizens, the right to vote and other government benefits.</p> <p>The quality of their care has been criticized by Trump and others, but people in the country illegally do not have equivalent rights to health care, except for emergency treatment. Public hospitals are required to provide emergency medical care regardless of immigration status.</p> <h2>On the number of people in the US illegally</h2> <p><strong>Trump:</strong> \u201cOur government has no idea. It could be 3 million, it could be 30 million. They have no idea.\u201d</p> <p><strong>The facts:</strong> The government actually has an idea. The homeland security department estimates there are 11.4 million people in the United States illegally. Few in the immigration debate challenge that estimate.</p> <p>The figure comes from an analysis of the most recent census data. The government compares the number of people whom the census reports as foreign-born with the number of people who have been admitted legally and gained citizenship. The most recent estimate dates to January 2012. It roughly matches the estimates of demographers from the Pew Foundation, which issues its estimates more rapidly than the government.</p> <p>Experts believe the number of people in the US illegally has been steadily declining as Mexicans and others return to their home country and illegal border crossings dwindle.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57c7967be4b0df5f040dc160\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-01T03:00:52.067Z\">4.00am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Today in Campaign 2016</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Let\u2019s just focus on the key aspects of Donald Trump\u2019s speech:</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"51af965c8b9d2f6a24fa4df8ecc7f17981d1ed44\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/51af965c8b9d2f6a24fa4df8ecc7f17981d1ed44/0_0_4128_2752/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Donald Trump.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Donald Trump.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Evan Vucci/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Donald Trump\u2019s speech on immigration, anticipated by some to be a \u201csoftening\u201d - as the candidate himself described it - on the issue, instead was a retrenchment in some of his most aggressive policies, including ideological tests for would-be visa applicants and the creation of a deportation force to hunt down undocumented immigrants residing in the United States, and included some new ones that have never been mentioned by a mainstream presidential candidate in the modern era.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s proposals included: the construction of a 2,000-mile border wall along the US-Mexico border, to be paid for by Mexico; the implementation of new restrictions on legal immigration into the US; a \u201csunset\u201d on visa laws requiring Congress to rewrite them every few years; a ban on taxpayer funding for cities that don\u2019t deport undocumented immigrants.</p> <p>The tone of the speech was not dissimilar to that of a Breitbart News article on the subject - appropriate, given that Trump campaign operatives revealed to reporters after the speech\u2019s commencement that former Breitbart chair Stephen Bannon was instrumental in the speech\u2019s crafting.</p> <p>The tone of the speech outpaces even Trump\u2019s own aggressive rhetoric on undocumented immigrants, and effectively puts the lid on any claims that he is moving towards the center with less than 70 days to go until the general election.</p> <p>Not all conservatives are pleased, however.</p> <p>A member of Donald Trump\u2019s evangelical advisory board:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/tonysuarez80/status/771176763166646272\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Extremely disappointed.</p>&mdash; Tony Suarez-NHCLC VP (@tonysuarez80) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tonysuarez80/status/771176763166646272\">September 1, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57c795c3e4b0f6cb85628bed\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-01T02:45:53.618Z\">3.45am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <h2>Donald Trump, in conclusion:</h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Now is the time for the media to begin asking questions on their behalf.

It\u2019s happening every day, it\u2019s getting worse and worse and worse and we have to stop it.\u201d</p> <p>Trump suggested five points to further grow the US relationship with Mexico:</p> <p>\u201cNumber one: ending illegal immigration. Not just between our two countries, but including the illegal immigration and migration from the central and south Americas.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThis is a humanitarian disaster, the dangerous trecks, the abuse by gangs and cartels, and the extreme physical dangers. And it must be solved - it must be solved quickly. Not fair.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNumber two: having a secure border is a sovereign right and mutually beneficial. We rec the right of either country to build a physical barrier or wall on any of its borders to stop the illegal movement of people, weapons and drugs,\u201d Trump said. The move is \u201cparamount to both the United States and to Mexico.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNumber three: Dismantling drug cartels,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThis can only be done with cooperation, and intelligence and intelligence sharing.</p> <p>\u201cImproving Nafta, number four. Nafta is a 22-year-old agreement that must be update to reflect the realities of today,\u201d Trump said, which would make both countries \u201cstronger and keep industry in our hemisphere. We have tremendous competition from China and from all over the world. Keep it in our hemisphere.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNumber five: Keep manufacturing wealth in our hemisphere. When jobs leave Mexico, the US or Central America and go overseas, it increases poverty.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe bond between our two countries is deep and sincere, and both our nations benefit from a close and honest relationship between our two governments.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI call you a friend.

The visit is also a timely distraction from embarrassing reports, which have dominated recent headlines, that he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/22/mexico-president-enrique-pena-nieto-plagiarized-thesis-law-degree\">plagiarized</a> his law degree thesis. </p> <p>This week\u2019s bad press, which includes the <a href=\"http://www.france24.com/en/20160830-mexico-federal-police-chief-sacked-drug-cartel-executions-michuacan\">sacking</a> of Mexico\u2019s police commissioner following allegations of cartel executions, follows months of looming scandals plaguing his own administration. These include large teacher strikes, allegations of the use of torture on ordinary citizens and most recently<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/09/mexico-first-lady-florida-property-government-contractor-documents-reveal\">reports</a> that the Mexican first lady\u2019s home is owned by a potential government contractor. All of the above have sent Mexican confidence in its president plunging.</p> <p>The embarrassing thing is that we can actually see Pe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s logic at work in real time as this disaster unfolds. The president thinks that he will see the bad man, appear stern to the bad man, tell everyone that he was indeed stern to the bad man and then his poll numbers will rise. Easy. There\u2019s only one problem with this plan. Trump may well hijack that narrative, frame the meeting to his advantage and then straight-up lie about the details in Arizona with a straight face.</p> </blockquote> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/31/pena-nieto-mexico-visit-trump-approval-ratings-backfire\">Pe\u00f1a Nieto's making a dangerous gamble with Trump's Mexico visit | Daniel Pe\u00f1a</a> </p> </aside> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-08-31T17:40:45.113Z\">at 6.40pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57c70edae4b0f6cb85628b1d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-31T17:11:10.748Z\">6.11pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The Democrats\u2019 <strong>efforts to swipe a US senate seat in Wisconsin are looking good,</strong> in a new Monmouth University poll of likely voters that has challenger (and former senator) Russ Feingold up 13 points, 54-41, on incumbent Republican Ron Johnson. </p> <p>Clinton leads Trump in the poll by a much smaller margin, five points, in a four-way race:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/SteveKornacki/status/771031136751521792\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Wisconsin (Monmouth)<br><br>Clinton 43%<br>Trump 38%<br>Johnson 7%<br>Stein 3%</p>&mdash; Steve Kornacki (@SteveKornacki) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SteveKornacki/status/771031136751521792\">August 31, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/SteveKornacki/status/771032155409481728\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Last Republican to win WI was Reagan in 84, but there have been two very near-misses: W lost by 5k votes (0.2%) in &#39;00 and 11k (0.4%) in &#39;04</p>&mdash; Steve Kornacki (@SteveKornacki) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SteveKornacki/status/771032155409481728\">August 31, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Nate_Cohn/status/771032339099033600\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Solid result for Trump, through mainly bc Clinton low <a href=\"https://t.co/ZeYyxRdbYF\">https://t.co/ZeYyxRdbYF</a></p>&mdash; Nate Cohn (@Nate_Cohn) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Nate_Cohn/status/771032339099033600\">August 31, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>\u201cThe current presidential election race in Wisconsin is looking a lot like the 2012 contest right now,\u201d said Patrick Murray, director of the independent Monmouth University Polling Institute.</p> <p><strong>Update: and Marquette University </strong>has issued a new poll, minutes after the Monmouth poll, with a five-point lead for Clinton among registered voters in Wisconsin but only a three-point lead among likely voters:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/pbump/status/771035873509052416\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Marquette in Wisc.: <br>Clinton +5 (RV)<br>Clinton +3 (LV)<br>Was Clinton +15 w/ LV on 8/7, Clinton +4 w/ LV on 7/10<br>Farewell, convention bump.</p>&mdash; Philip Bump (@pbump) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/pbump/status/771035873509052416\">August 31, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/MULawPoll/status/771036116199804928\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">&quot;Huge percentage&quot; of electorate not supporting any of the four candidates, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PollsAndVotes\">@PollsAndVotes</a> says. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/mulawpoll?src=hash\">#mulawpoll</a></p>&mdash; MULawPoll (@MULawPoll) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MULawPoll/status/771036116199804928\">August 31, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-08-31T17:30:30.875Z\">at 6.30pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57c70d32e4b04fe839bc5303\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-31T17:01:17.945Z\">6.01pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Former president Fox stays after Trump on Twitter:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/VicenteFoxQue/status/771029599098589184\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">How <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump\">@realDonaldTrump</a> will explain the &quot;unexplainable&quot;?

  "<p>The government is falling behind on its commitments to switch a proportion of Britain\u2019s car fleet to electric vehicles, an influential committee of MPs said on Thursday.</p> <p>Take-up of electric vehicles has been slower than hoped in the UK, but the technology is essential to reducing greenhouse gas emissions from transport, and tackling the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jun/15/diesel-vehicles-take-record-share-of-the-market-on-londons-roads\">air pollution produced by the increased number of diesel cars on the road</a>.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/.../ulev-2015-2020.pdf\">According to the guideline target recommended by the government\u2019s climate advisors</a>, ultra-low emission vehicles such as electric cars should make up 9% of the fleet by 2020, but current forecasts by the Department for Transport (DfT) show the figure by the end of the decade is likely to be about half that. Ministers have not said what should happen if the target is not met, nor produced a plan for beyond 2020.</p> <p>Parliament\u2019s environmental audit committee said ministers were failing to put forward the incentives and infrastructure needed to encourage drivers into electric cars, while <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jan/08/london-takes-just-one-week-to-breach-annual-air-pollution-limits\">air pollution was breaching regulations</a>, with 38 of 43 clean air zones exceeding acceptable levels of nitrogen oxides.</p> <p>In addition, the committee said the lessons of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/ng-interactive/2015/sep/23/volkswagen-emissions-scandal-explained-diesel-cars\">Volkswagen emissions scandal</a>, in which the manufacturer was found to have cheated on tests to make vehicles seem greener than they really were, had not been learned. Affected models were only starting to be withdrawn from the market, the MPs were told.</p> <p>Mary Creagh, chairwoman of the committee, said: \u201cThe uptake of ultra-low emission vehicles is too low to meet the UK\u2019s climate change targets at the lowest cost to the public. Air quality targets that were supposed to be met in 2010 won\u2019t be hit until 2020 at the earliest. And it\u2019s been almost a year since we discovered VW had fitted cars with cheat devices, but the government has still to decide what action to take against the company.\u201d</p> <p>Electric vehicles do not produce emissions at the point of use, and the UK\u2019s electricity sector is becoming lower-carbon through the increased use of gas and renewable energy. They are <a href=\"https://www.theccc.org.uk/charts-data/ukemissions-by-sector/transport/\">one of the few options for removing carbon from transport</a>.</p> <p>Mike Hawes, chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT), which represents the industry in the UK, told the Guardian that manufacturers were investing billions of pounds in developing new electric and hybrid models, pointing to the rise in the range of makes available from five in 2011 to more than 30 at present. He urged ministers to provide more incentives to drivers.</p> <p>He said: \u201cWe welcome the committee\u2019s call for policy and fiscal certainty to drive the uptake of ULEVs [ultra-low emission vehicles], which will help the government meet its air quality and climate targets. Given this is still nascent technology which carries a price premium, the committee\u2019s call for support across government, from the Treasury to DfT, to help stimulate market demand, is well made.\u201d</p> <p>Nissan, which manufactures the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jul/09/nissan-leaf-car-review-zoe-williams\">Leaf car</a>, told the Guardian that sales were progressing well and that it expected further acceleration in future. An important advance, the company said, was that 98% of motorway service stations were now equipped with rapid chargers, a key consideration for drivers, and by 2020 it expected charging stations to outnumber fossil fuel filling stations.</p> <p>Dale Vince, founder of Ecotricity, which runs the Electric Highway charging network, added: \u201cWe share the committee\u2019s concern over the vagueness of the 2020 target for ULEVs - that target is a loose range, the mid-point of which is barely half what the Committee on Climate Change has said is required to keep us on track for our 2050 carbon targets. The government urgently needs to write our existing EU targets on renewable energy and air quality into UK law and set out clear policies for achieving them.\u201d</p> <p>The committee also called for a new target for two-thirds of cars and vans to be ultra-low emissions by 2030. Car manufacturers, including Nissan, would be given a greater incentive to manufacture such vehicles in the UK if clearer signals were evident in government policy, said Creagh.</p> <p>Friends of the Earth said the government should go further still, to have a hope of halting the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jul/15/nearly-9500-people-die-each-year-in-london-because-of-air-pollution-study\">public health crisis from air pollution</a>, which claims tens of thousands of lives a year and affects the quality of life of many more.</p> <p>Jenny Bates, campaigner, said: \u201cRoad traffic [is] the biggest problem, and diesel the worst of all. [The government] must create a plan for phasing out diesel use on Britain\u2019s roads, along with cutting traffic levels and preventing road-building adding to the problem. We know it can be done: the Netherlands and Norway are planning a ban on new diesel and petrol cars from 2025, which large parts of Copenhagen are traffic free.\u201d</p> <p>Air quality targets, set by the EU, were also at risk following Brexit, according to the report, entitled Sustainability in the Department for Transport. There has been no certainty yet from government as to whether these targets will be retained in UK law.</p> <p>The committee also called on ministers to set out a clear plan for dealing with the aftermath of the VW emissions scandal, which could include bringing a prosecution against the company, and for the rail industry to clarify its steps towards reducing emissions, particularly from diesel locomotives.</p> <p>Creagh said the government should redraw the priorities for the DfT to give greater weight to environmental issues. \u201cTransport authorities throughout England have told us they have had problems with getting sustainable transport projects off the ground, because the DfT places more importance on economic benefits rather than the health benefits of improving air quality.\u201d</p> <p>The DfT said it was committing \u00a3600m over the current parliament to encouraging ultra low emission vehicles, for instance through grant schemes.</p> <p>While the target of 9% of vehicles being low emissions by 2020 is endorsed by the Committee on Climate Change, a department spokesman pointed out that the government\u2019s own aim is much lower, at between 3% and 7% of vehicles by the same date. The lower end of this target is forecast to be met.</p> <p>\u201cWe see ultra-low emission vehicles as the future of road travel and we have set goals for almost all cars and vans on our roads to be zero-emission by 2050,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are confident there will be significant further growth in the market.\u201d</p> <p>On the VW scandal, the spokesman said ministers took the matter \u201cextremely seriously\u201d and the department was calling for a Europe-wide investigation, for VW to resolve the issue for affected consumers, and for better tests that reflect real-world performance.<br></p>",
  "<p>Two centuries ago, after the Napoleonic wars had laid waste to large parts of central Europe, the continent\u2019s rulers decided to redraw the border between Austria and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/germany\">Germany</a> along the Saalach river, right between Salzburg and one of its suburbs, now a Bavarian town called Freilassing. When <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/austria\">Austria</a> joined the Schengen area in 1995, the border in effect became obsolete: only a short white line in the middle of the motorway bridge still marks the division between the two countries.</p> <p>But a year ago this month, the Freilassing bridge once again become a symbol of the barriers between nations and cultures. At lunchtime on Saturday 5 September 2015 \u2013 a day after Germany\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/angela-merkel\">Angela Merkel</a> and the then Austrian chancellor, Werner Faymann, had decided to accept thousands of refugees stranded at Budapest central station \u2013 it was here that about 400 refugees on board a train got their first glimpse of Germany.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"96768820e3852e1481d428e4e4c7033fad4b840a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/96768820e3852e1481d428e4e4c7033fad4b840a/0_203_3600_2161/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Police check migrants in September 2015 in  Freilassing.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Police check migrants in September 2015 in Freilassing.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Guenter Schiffmann/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And it was on Freilassing bridge that a week later thousands of refugees found themselves stranded once again after Germany\u2019s interior minister, Thomas de Maizi\u00e8re, reintroduced border checks that continue sporadically to this day, leading to tumultuous scenes that have left the border town divided in more ways than one.</p> <p>Rainer Borchers, 38, remembers returning from his night shift as a hospital nurse in the early hours to find hundreds of people camped outside his home on the Bavarian bank of the Saalach.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"bd01c906fb803b260135a2de18dfefe891c2a0ba\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bd01c906fb803b260135a2de18dfefe891c2a0ba/132_362_4636_2781/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rainer Borchers\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rainer Borchers, disillusioned at the main parties\u2019 response to his concerns about immigration, joined the right-wing AfD.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jens Schwarz/the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThese people were in a lot of need: they were exhausted, thirsty and hungry. As a nurse, I want to help people, so I let them use my car park, my toilet and gave pregnant women a chance to rest in my camper van.\u201d</p> <p>Borchers continued to help for a week, after which he grew critical of the situation on his doorstep. He claimed he was spat at and threatened with a knife when handing out bottles of water, and one night heard shots on the bridge \u2013 police insist the banging sound was created by a van running over a traffic cone. </p> <p>\u201cGenerators were running 24 hours a day and made my bedroom vibrate. I bought this house with my own money, and as a carer it\u2019s not like I earn \u20ac5,000 a month.\u201d<br></p> <p>Borchers said he remembered \u201cpositive moments\u201d from his week of volunteering, but in the coming weeks he became more and more disillusioned.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve never had anything to do with politics, but I called the Social Democrats to complain, I called the mayor of Freilassing, and I called the district office, but none of them would listen to me.\u201d Then, he said, he called a nearby branch of Germany\u2019s new rightwing anti-immigration party Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland (AfD), \u201cand they took the time to listen\u201d. He has since joined the party.</p> <p>On 24 October, the AfD held a demonstration with more than 1,000 protesters and several hundred counter-demonstrators against Merkel\u2019s \u201cillegal\u201d management of the crisis. </p> <p>A year on, Borchers said, his town feels \u201cscarred\u201d. \u201cMy neighbourhood is divided between left and right \u2013 there\u2019s nothing in between. You are either pro-refugee or against.\u201d</p> <p>Others in the town disagree. Mayor Josef Flatscher said descriptions of Freilassing as a town divided were \u201ccompletely over the top\u201d. Last September the politician, a member of the conservative Bavarian Christian Social Union party, was driving back from a family holiday in Italy when he heard the news of the resumption of border checks between Austria and Germany on the radio. But when he drove across the bridge into his hometown an hour later, there were no border guards to be seen.</p> <p>The next morning, local police set up makeshift patrols in the middle of the bridge. By the afternoon, they were replaced with members of the national police force, who still carry out sporadic border checks.</p> <p>Twelve months on, Flatscher said: \u201cI feel reassured about the situation in Freilassing, but of course we are keeping an eye on the broader macroclimate,\u201d pointing to news of 6,500 migrants being rescued off the Libyan coast in a single day this week. \u201cThis isn\u2019t going to stop completely. But next time we\u2019ll know how to deal with the situation.\u201d </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"dd44fd73e7950c373af2cf91e6fa38237a882248\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dd44fd73e7950c373af2cf91e6fa38237a882248/0_795_5040_3024/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Syrian refugees Adel (left) and Amar\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Syrian refugees Adel, left, and Amar in front of the city\u2019s refugee accommodation last month.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jens Schwarz/the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The experience of the renewed traffic jams at the bridge, the mayor said, \u201cmade us realise how great it is to live in a Europe without borders.

Having arrived in Germany in November 2014, the 21-year-old Syrian shares a room with three other young men, on the ground floor of a spacious three-storey house with a little garden and several large trees in the front, home to 60 refugees who have been located here while their asylum applications are being processed. The ground floor is reserved for men, one side for Arabic speakers, mainly from Syria, the other side for refugees who speak other languages, most of them from African countries.</p> <p>Last September and October, when about 1,500 refugees arrived on the bridge from Salzburg every day, Misho had already been in Germany for almost a year and spoke basic German. \u201cSo I went to the bridge to support volunteers who distributed food and clothes and to help with translations. Both German officials and refugees seemed grateful when I helped, but a few times it turned out that the presumed Syrians didn\u2019t speak any Arabic at all. I have no idea where they were from, but certainly not from Syria as they had claimed.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/aug/2016-08-31T17:03:41/embed.html\" data-alt=\"Migration registrations in Germany from August 2015 to July 2016\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/aug/2016-08-31T17:03:41/embed.html\">Migration registrations in Germany from August 2015 to July 2016</a> <figcaption>Migration registrations in Germany from August 2015 to July 2016</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Since then, the number of arrivals has dropped considerably. According to Germany\u2019s federal refugee agency, no more than 40 refugees and migrants a day arrive at Freilassing\u2019s reception centre. The shelter, in a former furniture factory, was working at an \u201coperative minimum\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWe are lucky here in our house with the refugees, as there is some green space in front and we all get along well with each other. I am still really grateful to Germany that I can be here and there are a lot of people in town who are happy to help us.\u201d</p> <p>Some people in Freilassing, Misho said, \u201cmaybe one in five\u201d, seemed less happy about their presence. \u201cA few times people have even told me that I shouldn\u2019t be here. But then I always just answer them in German and then they are intimidated and confused by the fact that I speak German. That is my best way to defend myself.\u201d</p> <p>At the start of September, Misho is starting a new job in a restaurant at Chiemsee, a nearby lake and tourist destination. He would mainly be preparing salads, he said, but hoped he could work his way up.</p> <p>Yet not every refugee who made it across the Freilassing bridge has reason to be hopeful. Alhough police on the bridge currently only carry out sporadic spot checks, border control has in effect been moved inland to the reception centres where refugees and migrants first arrive.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1b37226639982e9a1188b0071fb595faa1562279\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1b37226639982e9a1188b0071fb595faa1562279/0_1366_4270_2562/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Police control at the border bridge checkpoint in August.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Police at the bridge checkpoint on the Saalach river last month.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jens Schwarz/the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Those who cannot show a passport or show an intention to apply for political asylum are sent back across the border to Austria \u2013 in August, German police returned 300 migrants from Freilassing to Salzburg. With the Balkan route now closed, many of them are either forced to stay in Austria against their will or have to try to make their way back across the Saalach river at another crossing.</p> <p>\u201cIn Freilassing it may feel like the refugee crisis has stopped \u2013 in Salzburg it is now starting,\u201d said Karl-Heinz M\u00fcller, a 77-year-old pensioner based in nearby Fridolfing, who played a key role during the tumultuous weeks of September last year.</p> <p>As the weather turned at the end of the month, M\u00fcller recalled seeing mothers with their babies waiting on the bridge for days on end, unwilling to move for fear of losing their place in the queue. \u201cI was so immensely sad about our collective inertia.\u201d</p> <p>On 18 September M\u00fcller, who used to run an analytical science company that specialised in inventing new techniques to separate chemicals, decided that \u201csince you couldn\u2019t rely on the police, you had to use your brain\u201d. With a marker pen, he drew a fat A on the wrists of the first 10 people in the queue, then set up a dividing line on the ground. The next 10 got a B, the next 10 a C, and so on. Soon, M\u00fcller was on to decimal places.</p> <p>After a few days, one of the local papers likened M\u00fcller\u2019s system to the Nazis marking up Jewish prisoners in a concentration camp, which made the pensioner very cross. \u201cAll we were trying to do was to create a just, fair system,\u201d he said. The deputy mayor of Salzburg eventually donated boxes full of colourful wristbands normally used at political rallies, which M\u00fcller used instead.</p> <p>After months of volunteering, during which he often slept for little more than two to three hours a night in a makeshift bed in one of the camps, M\u00fcller is ambivalent about the future, drawn between sympathy for anyone trying to make their way into Germany and understanding for those who are worried about the long-term effects of immigration. \u201cYou have to respect everyone who doesn\u2019t want more refugees. We can manage this, but only if the population at large is involved in the process.\u201d</p> <p>With his vast archive of documents, wristbands and children\u2019s drawings, he plans to set up a museum in his home. \u201cSomeone has to keep the story of what happened here last year alive.\u201d</p>",

He quickly <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/08/25/politics/trump-no-legal-status-for-undocumented-immigrants/\">backed off</a> that statement \u2013 the result was a policy that looked like a muddled mess, as even rightwing talk radio host Rush Limbaugh <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2016/aug/30/donald-trump-hillary-clinton-hacking-threat-election-live?page=with:block-57c5aa4be4b0df5f040dbd69#block-57c5aa4be4b0df5f040dbd69\">admitted</a> of the nominee: \u201cI never took him seriously on immigration.\u201d </p> <p>There had been signs, too, of a moderate tone earlier on Wednesday when Trump met with President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto on a surprise visit to Mexico City. At a press stop with Pe\u00f1a Nieto, Trump was restrained and talked about illegal immigration as a humanitarian crisis, claiming that he didn\u2019t discuss with the Mexican president his infamous pledge that Mexico would pay for a border wall.</p> <p>It turned out this was only technically true \u2013 there was no discussion, but only because the Mexican president had immediately begun their conversation by saying he would not pay.</p> <p>In his Phoenix speech Trump brushed all that off. \u201cMexico will pay for the wall, 100%. They don\u2019t know it yet but they\u2019re going to pay for it.\u201d</p> <p>Trump renewed his call for what he called a deportation taskforce. Without using its title he yet again endorsed Operation Wetback, the infamous Eisenhower-era policy of mass deportation, while lamenting shortcomings. \u201cThey would drop them across, right across, and they\u2019d come back.\u201d Instead Trump pledged to take those he deported \u201cgreat distances\u201d.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>He repeated testimonials from the parents of Americans killed by undocumented immigrants, using these to frame the issue not as humanitarian or even economic, but about crime and \u201cthe wellbeing of the American people\u201d.</p> <p>Trump did not explicitly call for the all-out deportation of the 11 million undocumented immigrants in the United States \u2013 something he has <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2015/09/11/donald-trump-says-immigrant-deportations-done-in-two-years/\">signaled support</a> for in the past despite even most immigration hawks opposing the idea.

But nor was it a detailed policy rollout. Much of it comprised traditional talking points and railing against Hillary Clinton, while taking detours to mock \u201cmedia elites\u201d who viewed \u201cglobal warming\u201d as a problem.</p> <p>Down to the \u201cMake Mexico Great Again Also\u201d hats, worn by the former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani and Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama, it was a return to the unpredictable showmanship that has defined Trump\u2019s campaign. Red meat for his party\u2019s conservative base, with nothing to attract moderate suburbanites, let alone Latinos or African Americans, who have been alienated by his harsh rhetoric.</p> <p>It represented the final chapter in what has been a back and forth debate within his campaign about whether Trump should try to act like a conventional candidate or simply be himself. That debate outlasted multiple campaign managers, the Republican primary itself, and continued well into the general election.</p> <p>It is now over. There will not be a more moderate Trump, there will not be a more compassionate Trump.</p> <p>Instead the same candidate who announced that Mexicans are \u201cbringing drugs, bringing crime, they\u2019re rapists\u201d is the one who will appear before voters in November.</p>",

  "<p>Nearly a third of Australians are working from home and are doing so mostly to catch up on work.

While 27.1% of women are casual employees, just 21.6% of men are. However, since 2008 the level of women casual workers has fallen, while for men it has become more common.</p> <p>One possible reason for the lack of increase in the level of casual workers, despite the increase in part-time work is that while women are more likely to be employed part-time, women part-time workers are less likely than their male counterparts to be employed under casual conditions. Seventy percent of men working part-time were doing so as casual workers, compared to just 47% of women part-time employees.</p> <p>The level of casual work within the economy also took a big drop in 2008 due to the impact of the GFC and the drop in the level of youth workers in the economy. </p> <p>Youth workers are much more likely to be employed as casual than others workers, and young women very much more so: </p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Percentage of workers without leave entitlements by age\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/5kui4/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Seventy nine percent of women aged 15-19 work casually, compared to 67% of similar aged men.

And the sharp drop off with age does not suggest casual work as a youth necessarily leads to it being an ongoing situation.</p> <p>That women are more likely to work in casual arrangements is also linked to the industries in which they work.</p> <p>Women account for over half of employees in the retail, accommodation and food, real estate, and admin and support industries \u2013 all of which are among those industries with the highest percentage of casual workers:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Percentage of workers without leave entitlements by industry\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/yKGQO/2/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Only the agriculture and fishing industry, which has just 30% of women workers, is a high-male/high-casual industry \u2013 driven mostly by the seasonal nature of much of the work.</p> <p>But the prevalence of casual work in the retail trade and the accommodation and food services industries is clear when you consider that while the accommodation industry accounts for 7% of all employees it accounts for 20% of all casual workers.

Seventy three percent of the 810,000 owner/managers of incorporated businesses work from home, and 67% of the 1.26m owners of unincorporated business do so as well.</p> <p> But while 2.056m employees work from home, a greater proportion of these are those with ongoing positions with leave entitlements.</p> <p>Just 9.5% of casual workers usually work from home, compared to a quarter of other employees: </p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Percentage of workers who usually work from home\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/97oFi/2/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Not surprisingly, the main reason the owners of businesses work from home is because that is where their work or office is located \u2013 chosen due to the lack of overheads or rent that would come with an office situated elsewhere.</p> <p>For employees, the main reason for working from home is not due to choice.

  "<p>Malcolm Turnbull is right to insist that softening our racial vilification laws should not be a priority right now.

Bernardi is incapable of speaking about this issue with the heart and understanding it requires, that Jewish Australians, for instance, really do fear antisemitism and the enormous harm that it can cause, harm that goes to their identity and sense of place in this country. Instead, he says those who support 18C have surrendered to \u201cOrwell\u2019s frightening vision\u201d and are members of the \u201cgrievance industry\u201d.</p> <p>He has applauded Senator <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/15/david-leyonhjelm-racial-discrimination-complaint-angry-white-male-fairfax-18c\">David Leyonhjelm\u2019s I\u2019m-so-clever complaint</a> about a journalist calling him an \u201cangry white male\u201d.

There are plenty of people on the progressive side of politics who have long had reservations about 18C, including, human rights lawyers Julian Burnside and Sarah Joseph, journalists and commentators such as Michael Gawenda, Phillip Adams and David Marr. </p> <p>The Australian Law Reform Commission concluded that making it unlawful to offend people \u201cunjustifiably interferes with freedom of speech\u201d, even with the <a href=\"https://www.alrc.gov.au/publications/laws-interfere-freedom-speech-0\">18D exemptions</a> for public debate and artistic expression. </p> <p>But the idea of bringing some sort of coalition of people together from all sides of politics to talk about where the balance should be between defending speech, even speech we might find repellent, even speech that hurts and offends, and ensuring there remains a line beyond which speech should indeed be unlawful is not nearly so much fun as a bit of Left bashing and a chance to puff yourself up as a freedom warrior.</p> <p>The cause celebre at the moment for those who argue that 18C unreasonably restricts freedom of speech is <a href=\"http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/nation/a-black-and-white-issue-from-both-sides-of-the-fence/news-story/abe946f4aae908b6ec621bdadcf3999b\">a Queensland case</a> reported in detail by the Australian. QUT administrator Cindy Prior complained to the Human Rights Commission after an incident in 2013 in which she asked three students to leave a computer lab because it was reserved for Indigenous students. One of the students later posted on Facebook: \u201cJust got kicked out of the unsigned Indigenous computer room. QUT (is) stopping segregation with segregation?\u201d. Another wrote that he wondered where the \u201cwhite supremacist computer lab is\u201d. A clearly offensive post - \u201cITT niggers\u201d - was attributed to a student who denies he had anything to do with it. All posts were removed after requests from the university.</p> <p>Prior, an Indigenous woman, claimed the posts were likely to offend, insult, humiliate or intimidate her and other Indigenous people and she claimed around $250,000 in compensation, in part for lost wages. She was distressed and angry at the posts, and the way the university handled them, and has not returned to work. The students say their posts were a legitimate expression of free speech, and that because the case has dragged on for three years, it has caused them significant financial and emotional strain. A federal circuit court decision is due soon.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/30/cory-bernardis-racial-discrimination-revolt-supported-by-up-to-20-senators\">Cory Bernardi\u2019s racial discrimination revolt supported by up to 20 senators</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The case is complicated, and raises one key question about the law \u2013 whether it\u2019s too subjective, that someone\u2019s possibly extreme reaction due to past hurt or discrimination should be taken into account, or some kind of \u201cobjective\u201d standard as to the likely hurt or humiliation should apply.</p> <p>But there is no doubt that this case highlights the problems of 18C and how these cases are being handled. It may not be the most important issue the nation faces, but it still matters in a multicultural society which values tolerance and robust free speech on all kinds of contentious social issues. It is dispiriting that we have nobody with the grace and skill to bring people together to discuss all this, to try to work it out, without demonising supporters and opponents as bigots or left-wing hand wringers.</p> <p>Bernardi must be pleased with his latest attempt. He is getting lots of publicity, lots of air-time, and a platform to present himself as freedom\u2019s saviour. But his bill is unlikely to go anywhere. Given his prosecution of it, that\u2019s no surprise. It doesn\u2019t deserve to.</p>"
