  "<p>Liberal senator Cory Bernardi has called for the government to halve the migration intake and reconsider the refugee intake or face the further rise of anti-establishment parties including One Nation.</p> <p>Speaking from New York where he is on secondment to the United Nations, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/nov/02/australian-senators-cory-bernardi-and-malcolm-roberts-pledge-support-for-donald-trump\">Bernardi reiterated his support for Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump</a>, praising his populist anti-immigration policies.</p> <p>Bernardi told Sky News he had warned of the rise of anti-establishment parties for years and said it

  "<p>The UK Athletics performance director, Neil Black, insists he is unconcerned that two of his brightest young prospects, the heptathlete Katarina Johnson-Thompson and the sprinter Adam Gemili, are still without coaches as they begin their preparations for the 2017 world championships in London.</p> <p>Johnson-Thompson parted with her coach, Mike Holmes, after a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/14/jessica-ennis-hill-to-decide-on-future-after-claiming-silver-in-heptathlon\" title=\"\">disappointing Olympics where she finished sixth</a>, while Gemili left Steve Fudge <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/18/usain-bolt-jamaica-200m-gold-medal-olympic-rio-2016\" title=\"\">after missing out on a 200m medal in Rio by three-thousandths of a second</a>. Both are understood to have been searching for replacements, with Johnson-Thompson considering whether to stay in the UK or move to the Netherlands or the US and Gemili understood to be favouring relocating to the US.</p> <p>Black, who on Wednesday announced which British athletes would be funded by lottery money in 2017, said he hoped the pair would make up their minds sooner rather than later. \u201cIt\u2019s a very difficult thing finding a coach who\u2019s got the right background, skill set, environment, personality \u2013 and the chemistry between the athlete and coach has to be exceptional,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are working with both Adam and Katarina to explore their options and we hope they make good decisions as soon as they can.\u201d</p> <p>Black also denied that with Jessica Ennis-Hill having retired, Mo Farah saying that 2017 would be his last year on the track, and Greg Rutherford turning 30 this month, that the next generation of British athletics would struggle to hit the same heights. \u201cWe all know how close Adam Gemili and Dina Asher-Smith have been to the podium, and we also have Katarina, Laura Muir, Zharnel Hughes, Nethaneel Mitchell-Blake and Sophie Hitchon to mention but a few,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not concerned at all. We just have got to get converting top-eight finishes to medallists. I\u2019m excited about what the future looks like.\u201d</p> <p>Black defended his decision to strip a number of athletes of lottery money, including the 100m sprinter James Dasaolu, the 1500m runner Laura Weightman and the former 400m hurdles world champion Dai Greene \u2013 as well as the decision not to reward Eilish McColgan, who made huge strides in the women\u2019s 5,000m, finishing 13th in the Olympic final and lowering her personal best by almost 40 seconds.</p> <p>The 800m runner Michael Rimmer suggested that UK Athletics had wrongly decided that McColgan was \u201cpast it at 25\u201d while McColgan\u2019s mother, Liz, the 10,000m world championship gold medallist in 1991, attacked the sports governing body, tweeting: \u201cIf I were London marathon I would pull out of the UK endurance programme and fund their own. UKA have the talent but lack the leadership.\u201d</p> <p>Black defended his decisions, saying: \u201cThis programme has an emphasis in winning medals at the Olympics and the Paralympics. That\u2019s its primary goal. In this next year in particular, there\u2019s an interest in the world championships and the IPC worlds at London 2017. That\u2019s what we\u2019ve got to focus on.\u201d</p>",

What\u2019s the fuss all about? Leicester City have taken to it like a tabloid editor to a xenophobic front page. Making their debut appearance in what\u2019s supposed to be Europe\u2019s toughest competition, or so says the marketing speak, the Premier League champions have made it look like a doddle so far and will qualify for the last 16 with two games to spare if they win in Denmark tonight. Their domestic form might have slipped, but Leicester continue to find ways to astound us. It\u2019s easy to be cynical these days. Come on, though. They\u2019re pretty great, aren\u2019t they? You might as well accept it \u2013 Robert Huth will have Leo Messi in his pocket when Leicester play Barcelona in the final. Andy King will show Andres Iniesta what\u2019s up. Get used to it.</p> <p>But let\u2019s not get carried away yet. Leicester have won their first three matches in Group G without conceding a goal, but they\u2019re in for a tough match tonight. FC Copenhagen, who are second despite lying five points behind Claudio Ranieri\u2019s side, are formidable at home, where they are unbeaten in 28 games in all competitions. There\u2019ll be no complacency from Leicester, who are expecting a physical game against the Danish champions. True, they ended Copenhagen\u2019s 27-game unbeaten run at the King Power Stadium two weeks ago, Riyad Mahrez doing what he hasn\u2019t been doing much of in the league this season and scoring the only goal, but that was one tough game, with Kasper Schmeichel required to make an astonishing save near the end. Schmeichel might have to be similarly inspired tonight. Then again, maybe not. It\u2019s Leicester. It\u2019s Europe. They\u2019ve got this covered.</p> <p><strong>Kick-off:</strong> 7.45pm GMT.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-11-02T17:34:56.226Z\">at 5.34pm GMT</time></p>  </div>",

Both will argue that they do not believe they are breaking the laws of the game because they do not consider the poppy a political symbol, as well as pointing to the precedent set in 2011.</p> <p>Earlier, May had told MPs that it was right that England and Scotland players, who will meet on the evening of Friday 11 November in a World Cup qualifier, should be allowed to wear poppies.</p> <p>\u201cOur football players want to recognise and respect those who have given their lives for our safety and security.

He was linked to the case of Zahra Kazemi, an Iranian-Canadian photographer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/apr/05/iran.worlddispatch\">who died in Evin prison in 2003</a>. <br></p> <p>Tara Sepehri Far of Human Rights Watch said Mortazavi was linked with \u201cthe most flagrant human rights abuses committed in recent years\u201d, including \u201ccredible allegations of torture and deaths of protesters detained in the crackdown following the 2009 presidential election\u201d. </p> <p>\u201cWhile this verdict shows that figures such as Mortazavi are not immune from prosecution for ever, justice should first and foremost prioritise addressing his role in Iran\u2019s darkest recent history,\u201d she said. \u201cYet, he also should be treated humanely, something that was denied to Iranians during his time as a prosecutor, and not be subjected to corporal punishment or other inhuman treatment.\u201d<br></p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/iran-blog/2015/nov/02/iran-new-wave-repression-says-akbar-ganji\">Iranian writer Akbar Ganji</a>, a victim of Mortazavi\u2019s targeting of journalists, told the Guardian the sentencing was a \u201cwhitewash\u201d. \u201cIt means that he is not being punished. It is not surprising \u2013 one could not expect anything else from the Iranian judiciary. Mortazavi is protected by the most powerful people in Iran. He acted on their orders,\u201d Ganji said.<br></p> <p>Mortazavi came under scrutiny <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jan/10/iran-prisoners-abuse-jail\">from the Iranian parliament</a> and judiciary soon after allegations surfaced about his role in the deaths of protesters imprisoned at the Kahrizak detention centre. Mortazavi has since been acquitted of charges relating to this. <br></p> <p>Hadi Ghaemi, of the New York-based International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran, said: \u201cThis sentence is yet another example of rampant impunity in Iran. No justice is being delivered here, given the extent of graft and corruption committed by Mortazavi, and his involvement in the torture and deaths of protesters in custody in 2009. Also, sentencing him to flogging, if meant to demonstrate a serious punishment, is just physical barbarity that does nothing to hold him accountable in any meaningful way.\u201d</p> <p>Ahmadinejad went to great lengths to protect Mortazavi after the Kahrizak scandal, appointing him head of Iran\u2019s social security organisation, which provides insurance to many government and private employees. <br></p> <p>In 2013, Mortazavi\u2019s name was mentioned in the Iranian parliament in a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/feb/05/mahmoud-ahmadinejad-ayatollah-ali-khamenei\">hugely embarrassing public row</a> between Ahmadinejad and the parliamentary speaker, Ali Larijani.

  "<p>It will certainly help to energise and focus the Brexit process if the high court <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/nov/02/high-court-decision-trigger-brexit-government-parliament-due-thursday-article-50\">rules tomorrow</a> that parliament, not the government, has the authority to trigger the process. As longtime critics of the system under which the royal prerogative is exercised by ministers alone rather than by ministers in parliament, this newspaper would welcome such a ruling. In any truly modern state, the consent of parliament should be necessary in a major treaty change, which Brexit unquestionably is, just as it is now in practice necessary, since Iraq, in any major UK military commitment. Yet although tomorrow\u2019s verdict will be constitutionally significant (and may well be appealed against), the reality is that to give greater authority to parliament, though welcome, is only truly meaningful if parliament wants to use it. At the present moment, that seems far from the case.</p> <p>That has to change. Brexit is the most important immediate problem facing Britain. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/02/moodys-warns-uk-credit-rating-downgrade-brexit\">The prosperity of the country depends on it</a>. The place of Britain in the world hangs on it. Even the survival of the United Kingdom as a functioning entity relies on it being sensibly handled. Our party politics are being reshaped by it. Brexit will be the most consequential international arrangement made by this country in generations.</p> <p>Yet most of Westminster continues to act as spectators to the Brexit process not as participants in it. Again today, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/nov/02/pmqs-may-corbyn-chilcot-hammond-to-adopt-flexible-fiscal-targets-in-autumn-statement-politics-live?page=with:block-5819d8c9e4b029b92ca44b29#block-5819d8c9e4b029b92ca44b29\">Theresa May was barely challenged on the subject at prime minister\u2019s questions</a>. It is as though the referendum vote has become the totemic one-off unchallengeable source of all political authority on Britain\u2019s future to which every other question must defer in all conceivable circumstances, however dangerous. This may be what the Brexit fanatics want, as they hound sceptics <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2016/oct/31/mark-carney-theresa-may-bank-of-england-tory-conference\">such as the Bank of England governor, Mark Carney</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/02/mark-carney-brexit-bolsheviks-new-target-chancellor\">the chancellor, Philip Hammond</a>. But it is bad democracy, bad government and bad politics. It needs to be resisted and stopped.</p> <p>Today, for example, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/02/theresa-may-irish-pm-enda-kenny-no-hard-border-with-north\">the government of Ireland called a conference</a> of politicians, business leaders and civil society representatives in Dublin. It was held to discuss the Brexit implications for Ireland\u2019s delicate north-south settlement, and for the future of the open border that Britain and Ireland have broadly enjoyed in one form or another since 1923, as well as before Irish independence itself. The maintenance of that common travel arrangement is a policy that all citizens of the UK should be concerned about. Though opposed to Brexit, the Irish government has been exemplary in attempting to publicise and codify the many complex issues that arise for the island as a result of the referendum vote. Yet the British government has not produced for British voters a tenth of the useful public material that its counterpart in Dublin has been providing.</p> <p>It was one thing for a new British government to require a bit of time to sort out how to proceed on Brexit following the vote. But that is four months ago now. British government and politics is increasingly living in a fool\u2019s paradise about Brexit and its implications, as well as about the timetable that will be triggered by a formal decision to start negotiations. The scale of some of the reality was made clear in <a href=\"https://www.psa.ac.uk/sites/default/files/Brexit%20%26%20Beyond_0.pdf\">a new report on Brexit from a group of independent academics and political scientists</a>. Its conclusion is that the process, with or without the parliamentary vote on the initial triggering of article 50 on which the high court will rule tomorrow, is as complex as it is unpredictable. But the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/nov/02/brexit-politicians-senior-academics-the-uk-in-a-changing-europe\">experts</a> are clear that the process \u201cwill test the UK\u2019s constitutional and legal frameworks and bureaucratic capacities to their limits\u201d.</p> <p>Theirs is exactly the sort of sober and factual document that the UK government is derelict in its duty by not producing for the British public. It performs the practical educative service of spelling out many of the choices facing Britain. These range from when article 50 should be triggered (as late as possible, in our view), whether it can be revoked (yes), how many negotiations are required (it\u2019s hard to avoid several), whether there will need to be a transitional period (almost certainly), the form of consent needed at the end of the process (parliament or maybe an election, in our view) and even the explosive issue of whether the referendum is binding (in practice yes, but in law no). The fanatical anti-EU press has a vested interest in not publicising any of these. MPs and parliament have no such vested interest. Their job is hold the executive to account and to govern Britain. It is time they did so.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 4 November 2016. An earlier version used the word \u201cproving\u201d where \u201cproviding\u201d was meant.</p>",
  "<p>The crises keep coming for Jacob Zuma, and if some in South Africa believe he will ride them out, others wonder how many lives he has left. Today it was the call for a full judicial inquiry into allegations of corruption at the top level of government by the recently departed public protector, Thuli Madonsela, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/02/jacob-zuma-protest-pretoria-south-africa-report\" title=\"\">whose report</a> warned of serious concerns that the president allowed the billionaire Gupta family to influence the selections of cabinet ministers. The document, entitled State of Capture, explains much of the opposition to Mr Zuma: the belief that his leadership has led to a huge expansion in <a href=\"http://afraf.oxfordjournals.org/content/114/455/226\" title=\"\">patronage politics</a>, not only raising moral and legal concerns but damaging the country\u2019s capacity to develop.

Earlier this year, Mr Zuma was forced to apologise after South Africa\u2019s top court <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/31/jacob-zuma-ordered-repay-upgrades-nkandla-home-south-african-state-funds\" title=\"\">ruled that he had breached the constitution</a> in refusing to repay government funds used in an \u00a311m upgrade to his private&#xa0;residence.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"686ee833d7bdab47084da05c9a39671e1d692372\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/686ee833d7bdab47084da05c9a39671e1d692372/0_19_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"South Africa's president, Jacob Zuma\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018The ANC will not regain support as long as Mr Zuma is in charge.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Herman Verwey/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>All of this comes at a cost for ordinary South Africans, further denting a stagnant economy, and miring a political class in infighting when it could be tackling the country\u2019s immense challenges, notably its enduring poverty and inequality. Street protests will not determine Mr Zuma\u2019s future, but they are indicative of the pressures he faces. African National Congress politicians know their remaining moral authority is haemorrhaging and that the bleeding cannot be stopped while Mr Zuma is in charge. The condemnations are gathering force: this week the Nelson Mandela Foundation \u2013 which has previously shunned political statements \u2013 warned that<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/01/nelson-mandela-foundation-jacob-zuma-south-africa\" title=\"\"> the wheels are coming off the state</a> thanks to his political meddling for private interests.</p> <p>Nor \u2013 and this should concentrate the party\u2019s minds \u2013 can the ANC stem its loss of political support, which has already cost it control of major cities <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/04/south-africans-deliver-stinging-rebuke-to-anc\" title=\"\">in this year\u2019s local elections</a>. It will not regain this support as long as Mr Zuma is in charge. His previously solid rural support base is showing signs of weakening and even his closer supporters may be thinking again \u2013 patronage networks can last only as long as there are prizes to distribute. Whether internal opposition to Mr Zuma is coherent enough for rivals to challenge him directly remains to be seen.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"d1e028ac40a04cd3a184bb23cb953b518a66d942\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d1e028ac40a04cd3a184bb23cb953b518a66d942/161_328_1826_2281/801.jpg\" alt=\"Thuli Madonsela at a microphone\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Thuli Madonsela on her last day in the office of the public protector in Pretoria, South Africa, 14 October 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: STR/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Whatever the president\u2019s future, there is cause for optimism as well as concern. The apparently endless controversies surrounding him are testimony to what South Africa has got right as well as what Mr Zuma and his friends have got wrong. Tellingly, the president dropped his legal attempt to block the report\u2019s release: the country still has strong courts, a vibrant media and a lively civil society \u2013 as evidenced by the student protests that led to the scrapping of fee increases. Its institutions have so far stood up to Mr Zuma and pushed back to maintain their independence. South Africa\u2019s constitution has played an important role in all this, as have parts of the ANC. So too have individuals such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/22/search-successor-public-protector-thuli-madonsela-south-africa\" title=\"\">Ms Madonsela</a>, much admired for her tenacity in the face of intense political pressure. A growing number of people are dismayed and distressed by Mr Zuma\u2019s actions, but these struggles are a powerful reminder of why institution-building matters.</p>",
  "<p>Ask 17 (count \u2018em) detailed questions about executive pay, the duties of directors and the composition of boards and you can expect to be overwhelmed by answers that cover little common ground. That is the experience of the business select committee as responses arrive to its corporate governance inquiry. The MPs may regret setting the terms of reference so widely.</p> <p>The best advice: throw the technical tweaks in the bin and concentrate on the simple ideas. Here\u2019s a proposal on pay that starts from admirably straightforward (and correct) premise that \u201cthe executive remuneration system is seriously discredited and needs substantial reform\u201d.</p> <p>So says the Institute of Business Ethics. It says cash should be restored as the essential currency of paying executives. In other words, abolish share options, performance share awards, deferred awards and most of the padding of modern remuneration schemes. The law should be changed to forbid payments that cannot be valued properly at the time of award.</p> <p>Salaries would go up, naturally, but the institute proposes a few sub-clauses. First, executives would have to spend an agreed portion of their higher salaries on the company\u2019s shares and then hold that stock for years, even beyond retirement. Second, any salary increase or cash bonus wouldn\u2019t become effective until shareholders had voted. Third, if the executives still wanted big cash bonuses (more than 25% of salary, say), they\u2019d have to give the same award in proportion to all employees, which would be fair.</p> <p>The main advantage of this approach is that executives would build up a shareholding over time and receive dividends on those shares, which should encourage more long-term thinking in boardrooms. Bonuses, which the outside world rightly regards as a racket because zero is awarded only when catastrophe strikes, would become a side-show. And shareholders would be directly on the hook for what executives are paid.</p> <p>The practical difficulty is that the public might not like the notion that a FTSE 100 chief executive\u2019s \u00a31m-a-year salary could become \u00a32m-a-year or more once the share-based carrots are scrapped. But the virtues of the system would be simplicity and transparency, which are currently woefully under-supplied.</p> <p>Indeed, as the institute did not say, there would be another benefit. The small industry of remuneration consultants, which has grown rich by peddling baffling pay schemes that produce perverse results, could be made redundant. Few would mourn its passing.</p> <h2>Beware the booze wars</h2> <p>It\u2019s a bit rich for Tim Martin, the pro-Brexit chairman of pub chain JD Wetherspoon, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/02/wetherspoon-boss-eu-leaders-brexit-talks-tim-martin\">to complain</a> about how the result of the referendum has created uncertainties for his business, his customers and his suppliers. He might have considered the possibility before distributing beer mats promoting exit from the European Union.</p> <p>But let\u2019s not be too churlish about Martin\u2019s lively rant about the \u201chectoring and bullying approach\u201d adopted by Angela Merkel, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande and the man he calls \u201cthe unelected EU \u2018President\u2019 Juncker\u201d. Behind the rhetoric lies a serious point: British punters drink an awful lot of continental booze.</p> <p>French wine, champagne and spirits, German beer and Swedish cider are \u201cat extreme risk,\u201d claims Martin, if UK consumers take offence at the Junckerist idea that the country must be punished for leaving the EU. He is surely over-stating matters in expecting a patriotic rebellion by consumers. But the EU tariff system on wine imports to the single market was designed to protect the French industry. Like Martin, the powerful French agricultural lobby will also be very keen for tariff-free trading in food and drink to continue.</p> <h2>Persimmon\u2019s pessimism</h2> <p>Still on Brexit matters, housebuilder Persimmon says the referendum had no impact on its \u201cencouraging\u201d sales over the summer. But here\u2019s the line that will annoy Theresa May as she attempts to boost the number of homes built in the UK: the country\u2019s second biggest housebuilder says it is turning \u201ccautious\u201d on land purchases because of \u201cthe uncertainty surrounding the potential impact of the EU referendum result on the UK economy\u201d.</p> <p>Investment in land and house construction are not the same thing, of course, but nor are they unrelated. The government would rightly be miffed by any sign of a go-slow by a company that enjoyed a 22% profit margin last year, thanks in part to those Treasury-sponsored Help to Buy schemes, and is overflowing with cash. But what could May actually do to give Persimmon and its peers a kick? If she has the answer, she hasn\u2019t shared it.</p>",

  "<p>Play-Doh has just entered the 21st century \u2013 and civilization, as we know it, might be about to end. Childhood is doomed. Or not. </p> <p>The company is about to release its first app. Children can now take their Play-Doh creations \u2013 or anything else, for that matter \u2013 photograph them against a white background, and animate them on a screen, creating 3D characters they can manipulate. </p> <p>This will trouble some. \u201cScreen time\u201d has, after all, become the demon of our times. Our grandparents worried about polio; our parents worried about television; and we worry iThis, iThat, and iOther will turn our kids into zombies.

And screen time, unlike polio in a public pool, is very easy to control. Are you a worried parent? Guess what \u2013 you\u2019re the boss! If your child is spending too much time on a screen, you have the right to take away that screen.

And pretty dangerous,\u201d was her succinct and ominous appraisal.</p> <p>But if they look unbeatable going forward, the challenge for Canberra might be at the back, with one of the biggest transfer shocks of the off-season coming when Matildas shotstopper, and one of the world\u2019s best goalkeepers, Lydia Williams, decided to leave the club she had represented since the league\u2019s foundation.</p> <p>It is a massive coup for Melbourne City, who also pilfered Matilda Teigen Allen from rivals Sydney FC, to create yet more fascinating subplots in the lead-up to season nine. With a bye in round one, Canberra United\u2019s first game will be away to City and the battle between Heyman and Sykes and their former custodian will be one to savour.</p> <p>With 26 players from all around the globe signed on already, fans of almost every club can look forward to exciting new prospects \u2013 Danish international Nina Frausing-Pedersen at Brisbane, Mexican defender Arianna Romero at Perth, or US sharp-shooter Jennifer Hoy at Newcastle among them.</p> <p>Add to this 19 from the current squad of 23 Matildas on the books of eight different clubs, as well as former and recent internationals such as Joanne Burgess and Servet Uzunlar returning to the league, and we have an assemblage of talent with which local fans have perhaps never been so spoilt.</p> <p>While W-League devotees still rightly harbour grievances over the lack of women-specific merchandise or membership packages, FFA appear to have worked harder to deliver greater exposure for the competition. This season sees 19 double-headers between W-League and A-League sides, 14 of which will be televised on both Fox Sports and the ABC \u2013 a development endorsed by Matilda Steph Catley.</p> <p>\u201cThere are people in the crowd who might not drive separately to go watch the girls, but if they see the quality, the different aspects that the women\u2019s game brings, then hopefully it can attract a new audience,\u201d Catley said.</p> <p>The W-League once boasted the reigning world player of the year \u2013 imagine Lionel Messi coming to play in the A-League \u2013 and yet as a goalkeeper, Nadine Angerer may have largely escaped the public\u2019s imagination.</p> <p>But with the consistent development of young local female players still a major headache for the governing body, perhaps the effect of such quality overseas players coming to Australia isn\u2019t as immediately tangible.</p> <p>\u201c[The foreign players are] always incredible, always technical,\u201d said Catley. \u201cThey\u2019re fast, they\u2019re strong, they\u2019re good leaders, so for young girls that are in and around the team they learn a lot from them \u2013 it improves the [training] sessions and everyone can see their class when they\u2019re out there on game day.\u201d</p> <p>Catley cites players such as the Welsh international Jess Fishlock or US defender Lauren Barnes, both back this season with City, as having been instrumental to her own career development, and invites younger Australians to see the armada of overseas players as an opportunity not an obstacle.</p> <p>\u201cI think it just means that [local players] have to be better. You can\u2019t expect to have a spot if you\u2019re not the best player in that position, so I feel like it\u2019s going to be exciting for the Australian girls to want to be just as good as the foreign girls that are coming in \u2013 so hopefully that challenges them.\u201d</p> <p>Two years ago Canberra United\u2019s Grace Maher, aged just 15, made a surprise start in the W-League final. With the gulf in class between the country\u2019s top league and the various state competitions, such big game experience is invaluable to a player considered one of the brightest prospects in the country.</p> <p>Today, Maher trains alongside World Cup winner Yukari Kinga \u2013 potentially one of the W-League\u2019s greatest imports. Few ever play in a World Cup final, fewer still alongside greats like Homare Sawa and Aya Miyama, and against Abby Wambach, Carli Lloyd or Megan Rapinoe.</p> <p>Melbourne City\u2019s title-winning entrance may have sent shockwaves among the W-League establishment but the reaction and recruitment from rival clubs has been hugely impressive. Women\u2019s football domestically may just have lifted to a new level \u2013 which is great news for player development, and even better news for fans.</p>",
  "<p>The man suspected of gunning down two Iowa police officers was taken into custody on Wednesday morning, just hours after the Des Moines-area shooting.</p> <p>Police named Scott Michael Greene as a suspect after he allegedly shot and killed two officers in an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/02/des-moines-police-two-officers-shot-dead-ambush-style-attacks\">\u201cambush-style\u201d attack</a>. Greene, a 46-year-old white man, is believed to have killed an Urbandale police officer who was sitting in his car just after 1am. A short while later, a Des Moines police sergeant was found killed in his car about two miles away.</p> <p>Greene is from Urbandale, a suburb of Des Moines, and is the only suspect in the shootings, Sgt Paul Parizek of Des Moines police confirmed. He has not been charged with any crimes but remains in police custody.</p> <p>After police named Greene as a suspect and launched a manhunt to find him, Greene himself asked a state employee to call police as he walked along a roadway one county west of Des Moines, Parizek said. Greene reportedly showed the employee his identification and asked him to call 911. He was taken into custody \u201cwithout incident\u201d, and was not armed when police found him. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/11/archive-zip/giv-1406IKElGlEwN7HO/\" data-alt=\"Locations of the Des Moines shooting\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/11/archive-zip/giv-1406IKElGlEwN7HO/\">Locations of the Des Moines shooting</a> <figcaption>Locations of the Des Moines shooting.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Parizek added that Greene was currently under police supervision in a local hospital for a pre-existing medical condition.</p> <p>Authorities declined to speculate on a possible motive for the killer, although Greene was well known by Urbandale\u2019s 50-person police department, according to the local police chief, Ross McCarty. Parizek said: \u201cEverybody involved is white.\u201d.</p> <p>The attack, and several other recent ambushes of on-duty police officers, comes in the midst of a tense national conversation on the use of force by law enforcement, particularly against black Americans. Five <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2016/jul/08/how-the-dallas-protest-shootings-unfolded-police\">Dallas police officers were killed</a> during a peaceful protest against police killings of black men in July. <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/17/baton-rouge-shooting-police-relations-barack-obama\">Three officers were killed in Baton Rouge</a> about a week later. </p> <p>The Republican presidential nominee, Donald Trump, has branded himself the \u201claw and order\u201d candidate, and has repeatedly called for more respect and power for law enforcement. Both Trump and Hillary Clinton offered their condolences to the officers\u2019 families on Wednesday morning, and Clinton\u2019s campaign canceled an event during which vice-presidential candidate Tim Kaine and Bill Clinton were scheduled to appear in Des Moines.</p> <p>At a rally in Miami on Wednesday afternoon, Trump said that violence against police showed \u201ca lack of respect for our nation. It\u2019s a lack of respect for our leadership.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/793824247168765952\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Praying for the families of the two Iowa police who were ambushed this morning.

Sgt Anthony Beminio, known as Tony, had worked with Des Moines police for more than 10 years.</p> <p>Parizek said Beminio was a \u201cgreat guy in this department\u201d and a \u201cfantastic family man\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s just really hard to lose Tony,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Officer Justin Martin had been working for the Urbandale police department for just over a year and was in the midst of a 12-hour shift when he was fatally shot.</p> <p>\u201cWe had high expectations for his future and it\u2019s tragically been cut very short here,\u201d said McCarty.</p> <p>Parizek confirmed that investigators still believed Beminio and Martin were ambushed on Wednesday morning.<br></p> <p>\u201cThere was absolutely nothing either one of these officers could have done to prevent this or save themselves once this had started,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Although officials were unsure of Greene\u2019s motivation, McCarty did say that Greene appeared at a court hearing on Tuesday for a dispute involving his mother. His mother was recently arrested for allegedly assaulting her son, the <a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/us/2016/11/02/suspect-in-iowa-cop-deaths-was-assaulted-by-mother.html\">AP reported</a>.</p> <p>Greene had also recently been involved in an incident at the local high school in Urbandale, where his daughter is a student, according to McCarty. Two widely circulated YouTube videos uploaded by a man named Scott Greene show a man arguing with police after being asked to leave a high school football game where he displayed a Confederate flag. </p> <p>Parizek couldn\u2019t confirm that it was in fact the same Scott Greene in the videos, but McCarty did confirm that Greene was recently asked to leave a football game at the local high school and given a warning for trespassing. At the game, Greene reportedly waved a Confederate flag in front of several black spectators. The YouTube video, uploaded on 14 October, is titled Police Abuse, Civil Rights Violation at Urbandale High School 10/14/16.</p> <p>Police said they had not yet recovered the weapon or weapons that Greene was suspected of using during the attack. </p>",

  "<p>\u201cI\u2019ll give you a few moments to get your papers in order,\u201d said Andrew Tyrie kindly. The chair of the liaison committee has learned to give Sir John Chilcot <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/aug/29/chilcot-iraq-war-report-delays-vested-interests\">all the time he needs</a>. The inquiry into the Iraq war had appeared to be indefinitely delayed, leading many to fear that the report\u2019s author had been nobbled. But when Chilcot <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jul/06/iraq-inquiry-key-points-from-the-chilcot-report\">eventually delivered his verdict</a> earlier this year, the findings <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jul/06/chilcot-report-crushing-verdict-tony-blair-iraq-war\">went a lot further</a> than many people expected. But not necessarily far enough for Tyrie.</p> <p>\u201cIn your view, did we need to go to war?\u201d he said, once Chilcot had made himself comfortable.</p> <p>\u201cNot in March 2003,\u201d Chilcot replied guardedly.</p> <p>\u201cSo there was no hard evidence to to support Tony Blair\u2019s conclusion that Britain faced a clear and imminent threat under international law?\u201d Tyrie asked.</p> <p>Chilcot replied: \u201cAny threat was in the the future and not specifically against Britain.\u201d</p> <p>Having got a by now quite sweaty Chilcot where he wanted him, Tyrie went for the throat. \u201cSo when Tony Blair told the House of Commons that Britain faced a clear and imminent present danger, he wasn\u2019t reflecting the truth, was he?\u201d he said.</p> <p>There was a time when British law didn\u2019t allow for double jeopardy. Or even treble and quadruple jeopardy. But select committees operate within their own legal framework. Although three reports have cleared Blair of lying to parliament, many in Westminster won\u2019t be happy until they have it on record that he did.</p> <p>The blood drained still further from Chilcot\u2019s face. The seven years he spent working on the Iraq inquiry have left him looking like a zombie. To all appearances, it seemed as if there was nothing more he would have liked to have done than agree that Tony was a serial liar banged to rights over the Iraq war, but convention and a misplaced sense of decency held him back. Rather than answer Tyrie\u2019s question, he chose to mumble something about the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/272079/5972.pdf\">joint intelligence committee\u2019s report</a> on weapons of mass destruction.</p> <p>Tyrie was not to be diverted. \u201cI think you\u2019re saying it was unreasonable of Tony Blair to conclude there was a clear and imminent threat,\u201d he observed.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d rather not use the word unreasonable,\u201d Chilcot replied.</p> <p>\u201cBut it\u2019s a binary choice. It was either reasonable or unreasonable,\u201d Tyrie said.</p> <p>Chilcot carried on trying to dance on the head of a pin before slipping and impaling himself. \u201cWell,\u201d he said eventually. \u201cObjectively it was unreasonable. But subjectively it might have been reasonable. It\u2019s impossible for me to say what was going through Tony Blair\u2019s mind when he came to the conclusions he did.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo what you\u2019re saying is that Tony Blair might have had a rush of blood to the head,\u201d said a clearly startled Tyrie.</p> <p>For the first time in the hearing, Chilcot relaxed a little. He was off the hook. A rush of blood to the head could just be his saviour. He had an explanation that was simultaneously consistent with Blair not having lied, while still showing that the former prime minister was a delusional sociopath capable of believing anything that he wanted to believe.</p> <p>At this point, the liaison committee morphed into group therapy on Blair\u2019s various personality disorders.</p> <p>\u201cYou seem to be suggesting that Tony Blair was a latter-day Louis XIV,\u201d Labour\u2019s Iain Wright said. \u201c<em>L\u2019etat c\u2019est moi</em> (I am the state).\u201d</p> <p>Chilcot shook his head. The Sun King was a complete amateur, an out and out democrat compared to Blair. Tony was in a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/nov/02/tony-blair-psychological-dominance-key-in-uk-joining-iraq-war-says-chilcot\">league of his own</a>, an autocrat who bullied his cabinet into subservience through a terrifying combination of withholding information, patronage and psychological dominance.</p> <p>\u201cWhat can we do to make sure parliament is kept informed of the evidence on which the government is making critical decisions?\u201d inquired the Conservative Bernard Jenkin. This isn\u2019t a question you hear him asking about Brexit. On that subject, he\u2019s only too happy for MPs to be kept out of the loop at every opportunity.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s a little beyond my remit,\u201d said an exhausted Chilcot. Blair had escaped for another day, but the net was closing in. MPs can be a tenacious bunch and sooner or later they will get their man.</p>",
  "<p>When I read the headline \u201cBono named as one of Glamour\u2019s women of the year\u201d I wondered if it was a joke. Women often wonder about jokes as we rarely understand them. Laughing at anything is also illegal if you are a feminist (but tittering isn\u2019t, so I had a titter). Bono is apparently <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-37845314\">Glamour\u2019s first male woman of the year</a>. In these days of gender fluidity, this is the smallest of details. But guys, really?</p> <p>The decision to give poor old Bongo an award \u2013 ever since I heard Dr John Cooper Clarke call him that, I have been unable to think of him as anything but Bongo \u2013 is apparently some sort of stab at equality. Awards ceremonies of all kinds have become increasingly unhinged and self- adulatory. Everyone must have prizes, and hopefully goodie bags. too. Everyone must make forgettable speeches and be papped on the red carpet. No one ever really knows who else won or why. It\u2019s all an absolute nonsense unless you win something yourself, in which case you step inside the madness by saying it\u2019s a judgment of one\u2019s peers.</p> <p>Bono\u2019s peers have given him all sorts: from a knighthood (honorary knight commander of the British empire) to a Philadelphia liberty medal, but according to the doublethink of Glamour\u2019s editor-in-chief Cindi Leive, giving awards to actual women at the actual women of the year ceremony \u201cmight be an outdated way of looking at things. There are so many men who really are doing wonderful things for women these days.\u201d</p> <p>Finally, men doing things for women! It\u2019s what the struggle has been all about.

A medal and a paper hat for any man who thinks things should be better for girls! I don\u2019t doubt Bono has done loads of charity work that he does like to talk about: the <a href=\"https://www.one.org/us/take-action/poverty-is-sexist/\">Poverty is Sexist campaign</a>; the work around girls\u2019 education and HIV, for instance. He is described on <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bono\">his Wikipedia page</a> not only as a rock star but as a philanthropist and venture capitalist. There is, though, controversy both about some of his work in Africa and his band\u2019s tax arrangements. U2 have been criticised for avoiding their full share of tax by channelling some of their income to a finance house in the Netherlands. Since Bono has been vocal about big companies such as ExxonMobil not being transparent about their taxes, with many African economies suffering as a result, this seems a tad hypocritical. But let that go. A lot of people are hypocritical about U2 because they used to like them and now it is not cool to do so.</p> <p>Bono has basically irritated everyone by hanging out with popes and presidents but maybe his heart is in the right place even if his taxes are not. Maybe he could be offered a daft award and do the right thing: decline to line up with the likes of US Olympic gymnast <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/simone-biles\">Simone Biles;</a> or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2016/oct/10/iraqi-activist-nadia-murad-wins-human-rights-prize-for-yazidi-campaign\">Nadia Murad</a>, the Yazidi woman who got away from Isis; or Emily Doe, the student who was raped by Brock Turner and wrote a shattering <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/11/campus-sexual-assault-university-colorado-austin-wilkerson\">letter</a> about her experience. He could have politely declined but carried on his work on HIV, as so many of his colleagues do. He could have said that poverty is a key feminist issue and passed the prize on to one of the many brilliant female campaigners. But no, he said he is very grateful because this is a chance to say: \u201cThe battle for gender equality can\u2019t be won unless men lead it along with women.\u201d</p> <p>Of course! This must be where women have gone so badly wrong. We need more men to show us how to do feminism properly. Bono is not alone in this patronising attitude. Most of the male voices on the left continue to see gender as some kind of afterthought and are not interested in the bodily politics of flesh and blood and women. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/oct/21/wonder-woman-un-ambassador-staff-protest\">new UN ambassador for women is Wonder Woman</a>, a bleedin\u2019 cartoon. Everyone fell over themselves to celebrate <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/caitlyn-jenner\">Caitlyn Jenner</a>\u2019s womanhood, ignoring her <a href=\"http://time.com/4268422/caitlyn-jenners-politics/\">dubious politics</a>. The misogyny around Hillary Clinton is unmissable. The one bit of sexual politics that the \u201cradicals\u201d embrace is often a denial of biological difference. Yet some of the most hard-won campaigns have been around rape, FGM, sexual violence, childbirth and HIV, where women\u2019s experience is absolutely embodied.</p> <p>Alongside this strange disappearance of womenhood has been the rolling back of tokenism: the assumption that everything is already a level playing field. Where many used to feel a public discussion should involve more than just white men, we are back to a position where it is now permissible to have all-male panels and comedy shows. Formats in which men thrive are too often seen as the only way to do things. This is a very simple and easy thing for men to address. When asked to take part in something, ask who else is involved. Ask who you will sit beside.</p> <p>Otherwise, we go full circle, into hilarious gong-giving stupidity. Why bother with actual women when you can have a cartoon to represent us, or a man? Because however extraordinary a man Bono may be, he is not a leader I will follow.</p>",
  "<p>Let\u2019s face it, this year our options in the voting booth are historically terrible. <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/10/31/clinton-loses-popularity-edge-in-tight-race-with-trump-new-post-abc-tracking-poll-finds/\">Poll</a> after <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/other/trump_favorableunfavorable-5493.html\">poll</a> after <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/other/clinton_favorableunfavorable-1131.html\">poll</a> has told the same story: the majority of Americans, some six in 10 by most counts, view both Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton negatively. Not, \u201cThat movie was a real waste of time,\u201d negatively; more like, \u201cIf my daughter goes out with him she may not come home again,\u201d negatively.</p> <p>Another way to say that is, most people either despise or fear both major party candidates, which befuddles both presidential contenders and their insular entourages but not the rest of us. That\u2019s why this year millions of voters are <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/29/us/politics/hillary-clinton-millennials-third-party.html\">exploring</a> casting their ballot for third, and even fourth, party candidates.

That was before people even knew who he was, so many voters were elated to find out there was someone on their ballots who wasn\u2019t Trump or Clinton.</p> <p>Then Johnson <a href=\"http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/283878-johnson-ive-stopped-using-marijuana-while-running-for\">put down his marijuana pipe</a> and started to introduce himself to voters.

And as despicable as Donald Trump\u2019s words are, I find Hillary Clinton\u2019s actions and track record is very troubling.\u201d</p> <p>But a cursory look at <a href=\"http://www.jill2016.com/platform\">Stein\u2019s platform</a> reveals she\u2019s living in an alternative universe from most American voters. While most voters fear the growth of Isis, she\u2019s calling for cutting military spending by 50% along with closing more than 700 US military bases abroad. This may be why her longshot bid keeps her hovering at around the 2% mark in national polls.</p> <p>In Utah and 11 other states, voters will see Evan McMullin on their ballots. The former CIA operative and Republican congressional staffer is taking advantage of Trump\u2019s repugnance to many Mormons and <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/11/evan-mcmullin-independent-election-230615\">is angling to win just one state</a> in order to have his name thrust before the all-important electoral college. </p> <p>McMullin makes sense for many Utah voters who say their faith prohibits them from supporting either Trump or Clinton. But barring deep religious conviction, in other states the notion of casting a protest vote is just too dangerous in this cycle.</p> <p>The Grand Ole Party is having a grand ole food fight for all to see. The Tea Party wing of the party has morphed into a Trump-fueled alt-right populist movement that <a href=\"http://www.mystatesman.com/news/news/state-regional-govt-politics/the-voice-in-donald-trumps-head-austins-alex-jones/nst9F/\">trusts Alex Jones conspiracy theories</a> more than facts and data. And Trump himself has even lashed out at the House speaker, Paul Ryan, and other congressional Republicans in recent weeks.</p> <p>But in a sign of the times for the GOP, Ryan <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/11/us/politics/donald-trump-gop-hillary-clinton.html\">abandoned Trump</a> last month only to <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/paul-ryan-votes-donald-trump-house-freedom-caucus-2016-11\">cast his vote for him</a> this week. It\u2019s that kind of unprincipled, even feckless, leadership from the Republican party that led to the rise of the misogynistic and racist Donald Trump. Republican leaders have stoked fear in their base since President Obama was elected and now they have lost control of their own narrative and voters.</p> <p>That\u2019s why this isn\u2019t the year to mess with a third-party vote \u2013 since no third-party candidate is going to win, all those votes might do is prevent a Clinton victory, putting the GOP meltdown front and center in global governance. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/31/us-election-green-party-jill-stein\">Don't settle for the lesser of two evils in this election.

Clearly given the importance of Anglo-Irish relations, the border with Northern Ireland, the billions in trade across the Irish Sea, the government in Dublin is worried about the prospect of a fresh diplomatic war breaking between the EU and the UK whenever Theresa May triggers article 50.</p> <p>Another significant part of the Taoiseach\u2019s contribution today during the all-island summit on Brexit in Dublin was Kenny suggesting that his British counterpart might press the exit button before the spring. Was Kenny hinting that pressure to get to an earlier Brexit from within the Tory Party was pushing the UK out the EU door before the Spring of 2017? Or indeed was the Irish premier sending a warning signal to London about the perils of doing so without negotiations having been properly started and exit strategies properly thought out?</p> <p>The main absentees from the Royal Hospital Kilmainham, a former military hospital and now the museum of modern art in Ireland, were the unionists. Neither the pro-Brexit Democratic Unionists or the pro-remain Ulster Unionists attended. Both parties have argued that today\u2019s conference went beyond the remit of the agreements that established devolution, power sharing and north-south bodies under the island of Ireland: the 1998 Good Friday Agreement and the 2006 St Andrews Agreement. In a sense they are right because the main business between all the political traditions on the island regarding Brexit will be done at the next North-South ministerial council, which will take place on 18 November in Armagh city. </p> <p>Away from the rhetoric there appears to be a willingness between unionism and nationalism to hatch a pragmatic deal that will not destabilise peace or plunge the island economy into the abyss. This cross-border body was established under the Good Friday peace deal and brings together ministers from Dublin to Belfast to discuss all island matters. Which obviously would include how do both states on the island cope with Brexit.</p> <p>Another important meeting takes place next week in Downing Street when Theresa May again invites the leaders of the devolved parliaments in Belfast, Edinburgh and Cardiff to Number 10 to discuss Brexit negotiations and plans ahead to deal with the 26 EU states.</p> <p>Today\u2019s conference now seems to have been a means by which Dublin sent out two messages to London and the other EU capitals. It was a warning to Britain that exit-talks with Ireland\u2019s European partners are going to be messy and perhaps even a little brutal. To their fellow Europeans, Kenny\u2019s suggestion that the other EU states should not get obsessed over what Britain gets is also a warning that if other countries start to issue specific demands of their own as pay-off to London then the entire European project could be put in peril. In both scenarios the entire political establishment in Dublin acknowledges Ireland has a lot to lose. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fa53bb94f5fd0b9c59ad2e02880c8e2928e33723\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fa53bb94f5fd0b9c59ad2e02880c8e2928e33723/0_162_4928_2955/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Enda Kenny speaks to the media on arrival at the all-island summit in Dublin.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Enda Kenny speaks to the media on arrival at the all-island summit in Dublin.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Clodagh Kilcoyne/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-581a0e5be4b07ceadb3a1ac5\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-02T16:04:45.970Z\">4.04pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The hearing has adjourned for at least 15 minutes because the MPs have to take part in a vote.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-581a0cb2e4b029b92ca44c69\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-02T15:57:43.054Z\">3.57pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Chilcot says the cabinet should have received formal written advice from the attorney general about whether the war was legal.

It is probably fair to say that a British politician can never go wrong whacking Fifa - with left or right, tabloid or broadsheet - and May milked this for all it was worth. It was an easy hit, but you can\u2019t blame her for taking it.</p> <p>Should Jeremy Corbyn have asked about Fifa? If Alastair Campbell was in charge of his PMQs planning, doubtless it would have been question number one. But this is not Corbyn\u2019s style and, if he had tried to set himself up as a Fifa-bashing poppy patriot, it would probably have sounded phoney.</p> <p>Instead Corbyn focused on welfare, highlighting cuts to universal credit, benefit sanctions,<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/oct/27/benefit-sanctions-food-banks-oxford-university-study\"> the research showing their link to increased demand for food banks</a> and Ken Loach\u2019s film, I, Daniel Blake. Some of his questions were quite effective, but others, less so. (For example, given that he was asking about universal credit, why didn\u2019t Corbyn point out that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/oct/28/iain-duncan-smith-challenge-theresa-may-universal-credit-cuts\">even Iain Duncan Smith wants these cuts to be reversed?) </a></p> <p>Corbyn\u2019s best moment was probably when, referring to sanctions, he urged May to stop \u201cthis institutionalised barbarity against often very vulnerable people\u201d. But May seemed comfortable with Corbyn\u2019s questions because she was able to condemn Labour\u2019s stance on welfare. She told the Labour leader:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>You have a view that there should be no assessments, no sanctions and unlimited welfare. I have to say to you that the Labour party is drifting away from the views of Labour voters. It\u2019s this party that understands working-class people.</p> </blockquote> <p>The moment Corbyn\u2019s election as Labour leader probably became inevitable in 2015 was when he was the only candidate to vote against the welfare bill. The other three candidates abstained on the bill, which included welfare cuts, in line with the Labour whip. But abstention was Labour\u2019s official position because Harriet Harman, the acting leader, took the view that being seen as soft on welfare spending had contributed to the party\u2019s election defeat. PMQs today confirmed that Corbyn does not accept this view, but it remains to be seen whether he has found a way of selling Labour welfarism to the electorate. May sounded like someone who thinks that he hasn\u2019t.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/nov/02/may-and-corbyn-clash-over-benefits-at-pmqs-video-highlights\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/5afng\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2865607\"            data-video-name=\"May and Corbyn clash over benefits at PMQs \u2013 video highlights\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-5819f826e4b0d073c27d0b04\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/11/02/161102PMQs2_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/11/02/161102PMQs2.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/11/02/161102PMQs2_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/nov/02/may-and-corbyn-clash-over-benefits-at-pmqs-video-highlights\">May and Corbyn clash over benefits at PMQs</a></figcaption> </figure>  </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-11-02T15:37:04.209Z\">at 3.37pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5819e361e4b029b92ca44b61\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-02T13:02:20.448Z\">1.02pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">May tells Fifa to 'sort their own house out' before giving orders to UK over poppies</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Theresa May has launched a blistering attack on football\u2019s governing body Fifa, which has turned down a request from England and Scotland players to wear armbands featuring poppies when the sides meet on Remembrance Day.</p> <p>Speaking at Prime Minister\u2019s Questions, May said the stance taken by Fifa was \u201cutterly outrageous\u201d and said the strength of feeling across the House of Commons was clear.</p> <p>\u201cOur football players want to recognise and respect those who have given their lives for our safety and security,\u201d she said. \u201cI think it is absolutely right they should be able to do so.\u201d</p> <p>Her response was prompted by a question from Steve McCabe, Labour\u2019s MP for Birmingham Selly Oak who was born in Inverclyde. \u201cWill she tell the respective associations [England and Scotland] that in this country, we decide when to wear poppies and they\u2019ll be wearing them at Wembley?\u201d</p> <p>May said the decision should lie with the respective associations but said \u201ca clear message is going from this House.\u201d</p> <p>Fifa, has been mired in a long-running corruption scandal, should be more concerned with its own affairs, May went on. \u201cI should say to Fifa before they start telling us what to do they jolly well ought to sort their own house out.\u201d</p> <p>The footballing body normally bans any political, religious or commercial messages on shirts.

Corbyn used all six questions to ask about welfare, but he moved from one topic to another, with varying success. May was at her weakest at the start, when Corbyn asked about cuts to universal credit which are coming down the line, which will effectively undo the tax credit cuts U-turn announced by George Osborne, but these calculations are complex, and hard to explain, and although May did not address the point at all, Corbyn did not drive his point hard home. He was more passionate, and effective, on benefit sanctions, but at this point May may had a solid response which involved accusing Labour of being opposed to any form of sanction or fiscal discipline in welfare spending. Corbyn finished with a dignified plea on behalf of parents who had difficulty affording funeral costs for children who die, and this prompted a semi-consensual response from May, who said funding was already available. So, overall, a bit of a draw.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgxEglC73aA\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/MgxEglC73aA?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-11-02T13:16:40.063Z\">at 1.16pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5819d814e4b029b92ca44b1f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-02T12:15:03.482Z\">12.15pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Corbyn says the housing benefit bill is going up.

In Leningrad in 1923, a theatre critic, Platon Kerzhentsev, founded the League of Time, in order to promote time-efficiency. Eight hundred \u201ctime cells\u201d were set up in the army, factories, government departments and schools. The \u201cTimists\u201d carried \u201cchronocards\u201d in order to monitor time-wasting, wasted motion and lengthy speeches. Without watches, they tried to guess the passage of minutes and hours, and were awarded medals for spontaneous \u201ctime discipline\u201d. They kept meticulous diaries of their every daily action. Lenin had the league\u2019s personal productivity posters pasted up on the wall behind his desk.</p> <p>\u201cMan will finally begin to really harmonise himself,\u201d Leon Trotsky prophesied in 1922: \u201cHe will put forward the task to introduce into the movement of his own organs \u2013 during work, walk, play \u2013 the highest precision, expediency, economy, and thus beauty.\u201d</p> <p>The poet <a href=\"https://thecharnelhouse.org/2011/12/07/the-ultra-taylorist-soviet-utopianism-of-aleksei-gastev-including-gastevs-landmark-book-how-to-work%D0%BA%D0%B0%D0%BA-%D0%BD%D0%B0%D0%B4%D0%BE-%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%B1%D0%BE%D1%82%D0%B0%D1%82%D1%8C/\">Alexei Gastev</a> \u2013 whose forbidding toothbrush-moustache and crew cut concealed a lot of mischief \u2013 took Trotsky at his word. He built a \u201csocial-engineering machine\u201d. This giant structure of pulleys, cogs and weights was a thing of no fathomable use whatsoever, yet Gastev insisted that a few hours\u2019 workout would turn you into a new kind of human being. He rolled these machines out across the young Soviet Union, as a sort of mascot for his Central Insitute of Labour which, with Lenin\u2019s personal backing, taught peasant workers how to behave in modern factories. A class at the Central Institute of Labour was a sort of drill practice: pupils stood before their benches in set positions, with places marked out for their feet. They rehearsed separate elements of each task, then combined them in a finished performance. (Judging by the sheer popularity of the classes, and the speed of the institute\u2019s expansion, the classes must have been quite enjoyable.)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f51efc796a2baa4017585a0a79024dad68dd7716\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f51efc796a2baa4017585a0a79024dad68dd7716/0_0_726_490/500.jpg\" alt=\"Bernstein\u2019s kymocyclograph.\" width=\"500\" height=\"337\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bernstein\u2019s kymocyclograph.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: HANDOUT</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Joining Gastev at the beginning of his career was the young Nikolai Bernstein, whose childhood spent assembling radios and building models of steam engines and bridges, set him in good stead when it came to mechanically registering the movements of the human body. He developed a high-speed camera called the kymocyclograph. The shutter, a round plate with holes in it, rotated before the camera lens, so that the photographic plate would record multiple images, each exposed a fraction of a second after its neighbour. (Motion-capture cinema, VR \u2013 and all the other technologies that keep Gollum actor Andy Serkis on the talkshow circuit \u2013 begin here.)</p> <p>By the end of these studies, Bernstein had good evidence that motion could not be a simple matter of Pavlovian \u201creflexes\u201d. His more nuanced model of motor responses amounted to a fully fledged <a href=\"http://www.pangaro.com/definition-cybernetics.html\">theory of cybernetics</a>, decades before Norbert Wiener coined the term in 1948.</p> <p>The early Soviet Union gathered unprecedented amounts of data on human motion, fitness, behaviour and genetics, making it a world leader in the field. A new kind of human being \u2013 healthy, fit, psychologically integrated and free of heritable disease \u2013 seemed, for a few heady days in the 1920s, an achievable aspiration.</p> <p>Then, in 1927, a miner called Alexey Grigoryevich Stakhanov went to work in a mine. He was no superman, but he was energetic and intelligent, and he could see ways of organising his work crew to increase the amount of coal they were able to dig in a single shift. On 31 August 1935, it was reported that he had mined a record 102 tonnes of coal in four hours and 45 minutes \u2013 14 times his quota. Barely three weeks later, on 19 September, Stakhanov and his crew more than doubled this record.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"23bbac1403cf2de7d340a10479579b7f64dabdfb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/23bbac1403cf2de7d340a10479579b7f64dabdfb/0_7_594_356/500.jpg\" alt=\"Alexey Stakhanov explains his system to a fellow miner, 1936.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alexey Stakhanov explains his system to a fellow miner, 1936.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Universal History Archive/UIG via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Others rushed to follow Stakhanov\u2019s example, and newspapers and newsreels across the Soviet Union celebrated their efforts. In Gorky, a worker in a car factory forged nearly 1,000 crankshafts in a single shift. A shoemaker in Leningrad turned out 1,400 pairs of shoes in a day. On a collective farm, three female \u201cStakhanovites\u201d proved they could cut sugar beet faster than was thought humanly possible. Such workers were awarded higher pay, better food, access to luxury goods and improved accommodation. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stakhanovite_movement\">Stakhanovism</a> soon became a mass movement. \u201cIn factories and even in scientific institutes,\u201d wrote the American psychologist Richard Schultz, \u201cthe workers\u2019 names may be posted on a bulletin board opposite a bird, deer, rabbit, tortoise or snail relative to the speed with which they turn out their work. A great deal of prestige is attached to the \u2018shock brigade\u2019 worker.\u201d</p> <p>For as long as human beings labour for others, their lot will improve only so far as their productivity rises. Investment beyond this point makes no sense. The Soviet Union of the 1920s was an impoverished state dotted with institutes of labour, health and maternity clinics, mental health services, housing offices and countless censuses. Coming to power at the end of the decade, Joseph Stalin replaced all this social engineering with, well, engineering. Magnitostroi, which is still the largest steelworks in the world, housed its workers in tents downwind of the chimneys. The construction of the White Sea Canal cost 12,000 lives \u2013 around a 10th of the workforce.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Drunk as we are on the illusion of personal control, we should remember that data trickles uphill toward the powerful</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Drunk as we are on the illusion of personal control, we should remember that data trickles uphill toward the powerful, because they are the ones who can afford to exploit it.

  "<p>Bomb disposal teams have carried out controlled explosions at seven schools across England after a warning over a lab chemical that is dangerous if stored incorrectly.</p> <p>Some of the blasts prompted complaints on social media from local residents, who say they were given no warning. </p> <p>At least seven schools have reportedly summoned police and military bomb disposal teams to conduct controlled explosions in recent days, and Dr David Kinnison, a safety adviser, told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme that more were likely.<br></p> <p>Last week schools received a <a href=\"https://mxm.mxmfb.com/rsps/m/swVdXX4_scbp6mOfSbpuAhEgCeaPdF7qn3Z9YySzDcY\">note from the science advisory body, Cleapss</a>, reminding them of the correct procedures for storing 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine, which is used in A-level chemistry lessons. If the chemical, also known as 2,4-DNPH, is allowed to dry out it can become dangerous.</p> <p>Cleapss told schools to check how the chemical was stored and contact them if they had any concerns. </p> <p>Kinnison told Today: \u201cWe have always known that this type of material if it\u2019s not stored properly \u2026 can become potentially quite dangerous.\u201d </p> <p>If allowed to dry out 2,4-DNPH can become explosive, he said, adding that schools that summoned the bomb squad over improperly stored stocks were not overreacting. \u201cBest to be safe rather than sorry,\u201d he said.<br></p> <p>A Department for Education spokesman told the Guardian the warning was prompted by incidents involving the chemical at a small number of schools, although he declined to identify which ones.<br></p> <p>\u201cIt has been used for many, many years. As long as it\u2019s stored correctly, it\u2019s absolutely fine,\u201d he said, adding that it was better to carry out the explosions on-site than to transport the chemicals elsewhere.</p> <p>The affected schools, according to reports in the local press, are Nottingham academy, Ryde school with Upper Chine and the Isle of Wight college, both on the Isle of Wight, St Alban\u2019sCatholic high school in Ipswich, Suffolk, Thomas Adams school in Wem, Shropshire, De Montfort school in Evesham, Worcestershire, and Turton school in Bolton.</p> <p>Neighbours of the Thomas Adams school complained on Facebook about the explosion after stocks of the chemical were destroyed on Monday evening, and a fire engine was dispatched. </p> <p>The headteacher told the Guardian the school had been advised by Cleapss to contact the police immediately and had been left with no time to warn local residents. \u201cWe were told the bomb squad were coming at quarter to six at night and they arrived by seven,\u201d Liz Dakin said. </p> <p>\u201cThe school were following government and Cleapss advice and guidance. We were left with little time to warn neighbours but followed police and bomb squad disposal advice at every moment, and really people should be very very glad the school and police acted as quickly as they did.\u201d</p> <p>The explosion was no louder than a loud firework, she said.</p> <p>At St Alban\u2019s school, an army bomb disposal squad carried out an explosion on the playing fields mid-morning on Tuesday as some pupils were celebrating mass and others were in lessons.</p> <p>Sean Salter, the school\u2019s business manager, told the Ipswich Star the soldiers turned up after colleagues phoned 999 the previous day. \u201cThe students were in lessons and half the school were in an All Saints Day mass in our sports hall,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cThe bang was a lot louder than they told me it was going to be. They turned up unannounced, so we had no time to inform anybody.\u201d</p> <p><strong>I</strong>n Wales, controlled blasts were also carried out at two Carmarthenshire schools and a college in Llanelli on Tuesday.</p> <p>One of the schools, Queen Elizabeth high school in Johnstown, Carmarthen, posted a message on social media: \u201cAlong with other schools and colleges across Wales and England, [the school] was alerted this morning that a particular chemical used in A-level chemistry called 2,4-DNPH may be unstable and liable to explosion.</p> <p>\u201cFollowing advice from the police, a small stock of this material was removed from the school and destroyed in a controlled explosion by the army at 3.20pm. The classrooms adjacent to the locked chemical store were taken out of use for the day as a safety precaution. This had no impact upon the smooth and safe running of the school.\u201d</p> <p>Last week Gower college and part of Swansea University were evacuated while controlled blasts to deal with similar chemicals were carried out.</p>",

The former prime minister was to blame in that he used his \u201cvery real powers of advocacy and persuasion\u201d in support of a dubious case for war.</p> <p>Blair also \u201coverestimated\u201d his ability to influence US decision-making on Iraq, Chilcot said. In September 2002 Blair did manage to persuade Bush to turn to the UN and seek international support for military action. But by the end of that year it was clear that the military timetable had taken control of the diplomatic process, Chilcot said. </p> <p>From the outset the Bush administration was set on regime change, Chilcot told MPs. Blair, by contrast, sought to reconcile the US\u2019s goal with Britain\u2019s objective, which was to disarm Saddam. </p> <p>Chilcot accepted that on the eve of his crucial speech to parliament in March 2003, seeking approval for invasion, Blair genuinely believed Iraq had weapons of mass destruction. The government\u2019s joint intelligence committee had wrongly told him this, Chilcot said.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>At that point, however, there was \u201cno evidence\u201d Saddam intended to deploy such weapons against UK interests, he added. There was no imminent threat, Chilcot said. It later emerged that Saddam had secretly destroyed his chemical and biological weapons after the Gulf war, and before international inspectors were allowed back into the country.</p> <p>Asked who was most responsible for the Iraq disaster, Chilcot answered: Blair, Straw, and the defence secretary, Geoff Hoon. Blair and Straw were more experienced and therefore most at fault, he suggested. </p> <p>Chilcot said he was satisfied with the positive public reaction to his report. He said it was \u201cparticularly welcome\u201d that it had been accepted by the bereaved families of the 179 British service personnel killed in Iraq between 2003 and 2009. </p> <p>\u201cAs things stand I\u2019m reasonably encouraged that there is an attempt in government to address those lessons,\u201d he added.</p> <p>Chilcot said he was often asked what his most important finding was, at the end of a marathon exercise which eventually ran to 2.6m words, and 12 volumes. After saying it was a \u201cwhole range of things\u201d he offered an answer: \u201cFailure to exert and exercise sufficient collective responsibility for a very big decision.\u201d<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Andrew Tyrie, the chair of the Treasury select committee, said the parliamentary hearing had been a useful exercise. \u201cSir John has started to put the final pieces of his conclusions into the public domain,\u201d he said.

  "<p>All three of these violin concertos were composed expressly for Renaud Capu\u00e7on, and all take his fiercely impassioned lyrical playing as their starting point. <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.brunomantovani.com/home.html\">Bruno Mantovani</a>\u2019s single-movement Jeux d\u2019Eau was the first to be completed: Capu\u00e7on gave the premiere in Paris in 2012, and like the other two works here, the recording is taken from the first performance. It treats the almost continuous solo violin line as the launchpad for a series of increasingly complex, sometimes almost delirious orchestral episodes that revel in the sensuous quality of the sounds themselves. The aqueous associations of the title are never far away, and the allusion to Ravel\u2019s work of the same name may be hinted at in some of the textures too, though it is always kept at arm\u2019s length.</p> <p> If the background to Mantovani\u2019s work is audibly French music of the early 20th century, it\u2019s German expressionism that haunts <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/tomserviceblog/2012/sep/24/tom-service-guide-wolfgang-rihm\">Wolfgang Rihm</a>\u2019s Gedicht des Malers (Poem of the Painter), which Capu\u00e7on introduced last year. As I calculate it, this is Rihm\u2019s fifth work for violin and orchestra; a single movement lasting about a quarter of an hour, in which the solo violinist is cast as a painter. That idea is a starting point for Heinz Holliger\u2019s much more substantial <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2004/jun/25/classicalmusicandopera.shopping3\">Violin Concerto</a> of 1995. Rihm\u2019s real reference point, though, seems to be the Berg concerto \u2013 his music contains several near quotes. It\u2019s still a perfectly conceived vehicle for the rhapsodic tendencies in Capu\u00e7on\u2019s playing.</p> <p> But it\u2019s <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.durand-salabert-eschig.com/en-GB/Composers/D/Dusapin-Pascal/\">Pascal Dusapin</a>\u2019s Aufgang that provides the real substance here, and comes the closest to a traditional three-movement concerto. It was first performed in 2015 too, though its roots go back to 2008, when Dusapin started work on a violin concerto that he then set aside because he couldn\u2019t find a soloist who was prepared to learn it. As completed now for Capu\u00e7on, though, it\u2019s a wonderfully coherent work of irresistible sweep; the central slow movement, longer than the two outer movements together, provides the real expressive weight, but Dusapin\u2019s solo part seems constantly to be reinventing and reconfiguring many of the traditional rhetorical devices of violin concerto writing; Capu\u00e7on makes every one of them wonderfully vivid.</p>",

The UK\u2019s duty to cut illegal air pollution as quickly as possible derives from EU laws but the action required following the high court defeat will be taken well before Brexit takes place. The government has said it will transfer all EU rules into UK law but, post-Brexit, the government could revise air pollution legislation.</p> <p>The court defeat is also a blow for the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/25/heathrow-airport-expansion-gets-government-approval-gatwick\">new runway at Heathrow the government has backed</a>. Its approval depended on the effectiveness of the government\u2019s national air pollution plan to meet legal requirements on air quality. The Liberal Democrat leader, Tim Farron, said: \u201cThis ruling deals a huge blow to May\u2019s reckless Heathrow expansion plans. The government has already illegally delayed meeting EU pollution limits until 2025 - building a third runway would make the situation even worse.\u201d</p> <p>Documents revealed during the high court case showed the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/18/treasury-blocked-moves-to-charge-diesel-cars-to-enter-polluted-uk-cities\">Treasury had blocked initial government plans to charge polluting diesel vehicles</a> for entering towns and cities blighted by air pollution, due to concern about the political impact of angering motorists.</p> <p>Both the environment and transport departments recommended changes to vehicle excise duty rates to encourage the purchase of low-pollution vehicles. But the Treasury also rejected that idea, along with a scrappage scheme for older diesels, which ClientEarth supports.</p> <p>The government\u2019s draft plan had envisaged 16 clean air zones, but in the final plan the number was cut, on the grounds of costs to business, to just five outside London: Birmingham, Leeds, Nottingham, Derby and Southampton. The further cities and towns that now need to introduce clean air zones will be determined by the more realistic pollution modelling ordered by the court on Wednesday.</p> <p>Keith Taylor, Green party MEP, said: \u201cThe failure highlighted by the judge today is as much moral as it is legal: ministers have displayed an extremely concerning attitude of indifference towards their duty to safeguard the health of British citizens.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/tools/tables/embed/index.html?spreadsheet=1QM6MaJVCX8zTeHR8aO9o-3HVpjfijuKGfkjCOEFKWiE\" data-alt=\"NO2 exceedance\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/tools/tables/embed/index.html?spreadsheet=1QM6MaJVCX8zTeHR8aO9o-3HVpjfijuKGfkjCOEFKWiE\">NO2 exceedance</a> </figure>",

As well as putting himself on the line, he became an authoritative and internationally respected nuclear researcher.

In 2008, he discovered problems with a mysterious top-secret warhead ingredient known as fogbank.</p> <p>He backed Scottish independence as a way of triggering UK nuclear disarmament. In the run-up to the referendum in 2014 he showed how Trident warheads could be removed from the Clyde within two years \u2013 and how they could not safely be based anywhere else in the UK.</p> <p>John played a crucial role in breaking the story of the Trident submariner, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/jun/17/trident-whistleblower-william-mcneilly-discharged-from-royal-navy\" title=\"\">William McNeilly</a>, who went on the run in 2015 after alleging 30 safety and security flaws.

After attending high schools in Kirkcaldy and Arbroath, in 1971 he joined the army.</p> <p>He served with the Scottish infantry regiment, the Black Watch, studied international relations at the University of Keele in Staffordshire, and became a junior officer. According to his family and colleagues, he was involved with military intelligence in Northern Ireland, though he never spoke about it.</p> <p>In 1980 he had a big falling-out with the army and resigned his commission, as a conscientious objector. Before he was allowed to leave, he had to argue his case before a tribunal, and to pay back some of his university fees. He then became a youth worker with the Church of Scotland, and studied divinity at the University of Glasgow. He worked for more than five years in the late 1980s as a community minister in Easterhouse, a deprived area of Glasgow.

According to a CNN a focus group, this moment was the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07nb_lqF2d4&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;app=desktop\">most favored</a> of the entire debate. That is because seven out of 10 Americans support Roe v Wade, and a majority of voters, including <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/10/abortion-poll-hyde-amendment-230349\">half of Trump supporters</a>, agree that Planned Parenthood shouldn\u2019t be defunded. And yet, reproductive health is not only on the line but on the ballot this election. </p> <p>For those millions who continue to believe women should have the right to make their own healthcare decisions, Hillary Clinton is the best \u2013 and only \u2013 choice. She not only trusts women to make their own decisions; she will stand up to politicians who try to take those decisions away from them. She has been a fierce supporter her entire career and we know, with her in the White House, reproductive rights advocates will have an important ally on their side.</p> <p>Bold leadership from activists, health advocates and others brought us this far - 100 years after Planned Parenthood started, women have made enormous progress. We\u2019ve won the right to use birth control, to safe and legal abortion. We are half the workforce, half of college students and doctoral students. And we will not go back. </p> <p>Today, we need that kind of bold leadership in the White House to make the progress of the last 100 years a reality for all and continue to build on it.</p> <p>Because the reality is that access to birth control, cancer screenings and abortion is not equal in this country. Eighty-seven percent of counties in the United States do not have an abortion provider. </p> <p>In 2016, black and Latina women continue to face enormous systemic barriers to reproductive healthcare, resulting in higher rates of death from breast and cervical cancer and higher rates of uninsurance.</p> <p>Many immigrants are excluded from healthcare coverage or face other hurdles to getting care for themselves and their families. And LGBTQ communities face major barriers to access to reproductive healthcare, from lack of culturally competent training of providers to meet their healthcare needs to outright discrimination.</p> <p>There are steps we can take to level the playing field for those left behind by uneven progress. Right now the discriminatory <a href=\"https://www.plannedparenthoodaction.org/issues/abortion/hyde-amendment\">Hyde amendment</a> forces women who rely on Medicaid to pay out of pocket for abortion, a financial hurdle that makes their right to safe and legal abortion meaningless. </p> <p>Hillary Clinton will work to overturn it. Because she understands the experiences of women, she\u2019s committed to building on the progress of the Affordable Care Act, which covers preventive care for women, maternity care, and bans insurance companies from charging women more for the same coverage as men. She has plans for expanding <a href=\"https://www.hillaryclinton.com/issues/health-care/\">access to care</a>, especially where it\u2019s needed most, for ending HIV/Aids, for women\u2019s health, and more.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/20/nasty-woman-insult-hillary-clinton\">'Nasty woman' is an insult we know all too well</a> </p> </aside>  <p>We need Hillary Clinton\u2019s leadership because politicians like Donald Trump and Mike Pence do not trust women to make their own healthcare decisions. They have promised over and over to drag reproductive rights back decades by punishing women who get abortions and appointing justices to overturn Roe v Wade. They want to block access to birth control and cancer screenings at Planned Parenthood, and undo the progress toward equality for women\u2019s health under the Affordable Care Act by repealing it. </p> <p>Unfortunately, Trump and Pence\u2019s attitude toward women is not a rarity in politics. In race after race this cycle, we have seen candidates pretending to embrace policies that support women while voting repeatedly to defund Planned Parenthood and restricting access to birth control. And in many states, including my home state of Texas, anti-women\u2019s health politicians hold the majority. In the first half of 2016 alone, these politicians introduced <a href=\"https://www.guttmacher.org/article/2016/07/laws-affecting-reproductive-health-and-rights-state-trends-midyear-2016\">445 provisions</a> to restrict access to safe and legal abortion. </p> <p>Deciding when and whether to have children is one of the most important decisions anyone makes in their lifetime, and it\u2019s not the government\u2019s role to interfere.</p> <p>The week she clinched the nomination, Hillary Clinton <a href=\"http://time.com/4364631/hillary-clinton-planned-parenthood-speech-transcript/\">spoke</a> to Planned Parenthood Action Fund members, saying, \u201cLife is freer, fairer, healthier, safer, and far more humane when women are empowered to make their own reproductive health decisions.\u201d</p> <p>She knows this from her own life, as a woman, mother and grandmother, and she has made it one of the central themes of her career as a public servant. She made it clear as first lady when she traveled to Beijing, against the advice of those who told her it would rock the boat, with the message \u201cwomen\u2019s rights are human rights, once and for all\u201d.</p> <p>She put it into action as secretary of state, prioritizing education, health and opportunity for women and girls. </p> <p>Hillary Clinton is the fiercest champion for women and reproductive rights to ever be within reach of the presidency. For her, these are not fringe issues \u2013 for women, they touch every aspect of our lives. </p> <p>This election is a choice between someone who will divide and insult us, and set us back decades in ensuring equality and economic security for ourselves and our families, or someone who has set a new precedent for bold leadership on behalf of women\u2019s health and rights. </p> <p>There is no contest. There is only one choice. We need Hillary Clinton in the White House.</p>",

  "<p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/legal/terms\">Facebook\u2019s terms of service</a> are pretty clear, by the standards of such things. (I should know: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jun/15/i-read-all-the-small-print-on-the-internet\">I once read 150,000 words of small print in a week</a> to see what I would find out.) There are very few random blocks of all-caps, it\u2019s fairly short, and it has hyperlinks in it. You don\u2019t even have to scroll down to find one of the key sections, which lays out what it means when you share information with Facebook. </p> <p>\u201cYou own all of the content and information you post on Facebook,\u201d the company assures you, \u201cand you can control how it is shared through your privacy and application settings.\u201d</p> <p>So who is Facebook to tell me that I can\u2019t share the information I own and I control with a company that\u2019s offering me a hefty discount for doing so?</p> <p>But that\u2019s what <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/nov/02/facebook-admiral-car-insurance-privacy-data\">Facebook did today</a>, in response to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/nov/02/admiral-to-price-car-insurance-based-on-facebook-posts\">insurance company Admiral\u2019s plan</a> to let young drivers share their Facebook posts to prove they are low-risk.</p> <p>Let\u2019s be clear: Admiral\u2019s plan isn\u2019t something I was fighting to sign up for. For one thing, I don\u2019t drive and have zero posts on my Facebook account. Not quite the target market, there. But there are more generalised reasons to be wary: Admiral\u2019s bizarre pseudoscientific claim that exclamation mark use indicated a bad driver, for instance. </p> <p>I\u2019m also not eager to contribute to the erosion of risk-pooling which lies at the heart of the entire concept of insurance. And, frankly, there\u2019s something of the surveillance state about your every personal action having a financial consequence as it gets filtered through the corporate realm.</p> <p>Despite that, is Facebook really fighting my corner? The company forced Admiral to pull its test product, citing section 3.15 of the company\u2019s platform policy \u2013 the rules under which apps are allowed to plug in to Facebook\u2019s site. Those rules are clear: Facebook data should not be used to \u201cmake decisions about eligibility, including whether to approve or reject an application or how much interest to charge on a loan.\u201d</p> <p>In a statement, Facebook celebrated its rejection of Admiral: \u201cProtecting the privacy of the people on Facebook is of utmost importance to us. We have clear guidelines that prevent information being obtained from Facebook from being used to make decisions about eligibility.\u201d</p> <p>But it\u2019s hard to see how the privacy of people on Facebook has been protected. Admiral\u2019s software was opt-in, ensuring that the company saw nothing its customers didn\u2019t share with them. What\u2019s more, the software plugged into Facebook with a single, explicit, well-communicated purpose: scan your Facebook profile to find out if you\u2019re eligible for discounts on your care insurance.</p> <p>Compare that, for instance, with the permissions required to play even a simple game. Words With Friends, for instance, asks for your public profile, friends list, and email address before you can play it. Does a scrabble clone really need to know my age and gender? Wouldn\u2019t a site that cares about privacy crack down on that, first?</p> <p>The fact is, Facebook isn\u2019t really acting based on Admiral\u2019s invasion \u2013 or not \u2013 of users\u2019 privacy. It\u2019s acting because Admiral has violated Facebook\u2019s exclusive right to be the only company that uses Facebook data to discriminate.</p> <p>If Facebook cared about unfair profiling and privacy abuse, for instance, it would probably not have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/mar/22/facebooks-ethnic-affinity-advertising-concerns-racial-profiling\">started grouping its users together based on their \u201cEthnic Affinity\u201d</a>. It wouldn\u2019t then allow that ethnic affinity to be used as a basis for excluding users from advertisements, and it certainly wouldn\u2019t allows that ethnic affinity to be used as a basis for <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/facebook-lets-advertisers-exclude-users-by-race\">potentially illegal discrimination in real estate advertising</a>.</p> <p>If Facebook cared about the privacy of its users, it wouldn\u2019t strain as hard as it could to suggest \u201cpeople you may know\u201d based on the slimmest of inferences. It certainly wouldn\u2019t go so far as to <a href=\"http://fusion.net/story/339018/facebook-psychiatrist-privacy-problems/\">recommend that patients befriend other people who visit the same psychiatrist as them</a>. That seems like a far bigger privacy breach than willingly letting your insurance company read your posts.</p> <p>There may be a simpler reason why Facebook doesn\u2019t like like the Admiral. If you realised you could get a discount on your car insurance by being cautious about what you post, you might make fewer personal posts, you might fewer spontaneous posts, or you might just make fewer posts. <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://fortune.com/2016/04/07/facebook-sharing-decline/\">Facebook has already seen a decline in what it calls \u201cpersonal updates\u201d</a> \u2013 that\u2019s you or I actually writing a Facebook post, rather than simply sharing a link or liking a picture \u2013 and it could be scared that that trend could continue. If our visits to the site drop, Facebook\u2019s share price could go the same direction.</p> <p>So don\u2019t fool yourself. Facebook isn\u2019t fighting in your corner against an evil insurance company (even if that insurance company isn\u2019t exactly on the side of angels either). It just wants to make sure you don\u2019t think twice next time you post \u201cJust got drunk and texted all my exes!!!! Think I\u2019m going to get a tattoo next!!!\u201d</p>",

  "<p>My mother, Lois Hainsworth, who has died aged 89, was a lifelong campaigner for women\u2019s causes.</p> <p>She was a member of the <a href=\"http://www.icw-cif.com\">International Council of Women</a> (ICW) and for more than 45 years, from 1958, she held senior posts in that organisation; she was also a member of the <a href=\"http://www.ecicw-cecif.com\">European Centre for ICW</a>. In 1983 she joined Unifem UK and was elected president in 2001. Fired by her passion and desire for positive change, she helped the former Labour MP Tony Colman to campaign for a change in trafficking legislation.</p> <p>Born in Worksop, Nottinghamshire, Lois lived through the blitz during the second world war in London. Her father, Lord Houchin (whose father gave all his children titles as first names), was a linguist and civil servant; her mother, Ann (nee Clark), ran a corner shop. After leaving Thames Valley grammar school, Lois took a secretarial course in Chiswick but showed talent as a singer. She went to Vienna at 19 to study opera.</p> <p>In her early 20s Lois joined the Royal Opera but needed another, part-time, job. She worked as a PA to a director at the Rank film group. While living this life of expense accounts, haute couture and talent-spotting trips for Max Factor, for which Rank was making advertisements, she investigated the Baha\u2019i faith. Seeking a lifestyle that encouraged individual development twinned with service to humanity, she became a Baha\u2019i in 1956.</p> <p>She met Philip Hainsworth, a government entomologist working in Uganda, while he was in London for a month-long break. After a week they decided to marry, and within the month Lois was living in Uganda in a newly built village hut. She set up an opera company touring Mozart to schools across Uganda, coordinated the building of the Baha\u2019i temple for Africa and joined the ICW.</p> <p>In 1968 Lois returned to Britain with her children, Richard and Zarin, continuing voluntary activities with women\u2019s organisations and the Baha\u2019i faith. Philip joined the family a year later, after finishing his contract in Uganda. In 1981 Lois joined the National Council of Women, on which she held a variety of senior posts until 2013. She also signed up for the Chartered Institute of Journalists after taking a press office job at the Royal Academy of Dance, and served as its president for two years from 1996.</p> <p>Lois travelled to more than 50 countries between 1970 and 2010. A regular attendee at the UN Commission on the Status of Women, she believed in the value of the UN and took part in the World Conferences for Women in Copenhagen (1980), Nairobi (1985) and Beijing (1995).<strong> </strong>She was appointed MBE in 2003 for her service to women\u2019s support organisations.</p> <p>Lois stayed active, taking a parachute jump for her 80th birthday, and declaring: \u201cVery refreshing, I think I will do another one for my 90th.\u201d</p> <p>Philip died in 2001. Lois is survived by me, her two sons, Richard and Michael, eight grandchildren and three great-grandchildren. </p>",

It\u2019s not actually real!\u201d She was told she should stop whining about something that had just happened in a computer game. The backlash was so intense that it caused Belamire to suspend her Twitter account.</p> <p>Can you be sexually assaulted in virtual reality? And can anything be done to prevent it? Those are a few of the most pressing ethical questions technologists, investors and we the public will face as VR grows. </p> <p>And growing it is. According to Digi-Capital, there <a href=\"http://www.digi-capital.com/news/2016/04/arvr-investment-hits-1-7-billion-in-last-12-months/#.WBjCGJMrI_V\">was</a> $1.7bn worth of augmented reality/virtual reality investments in the 12 months to Q1 2016. Goldman Sachs Group <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-01-13/goldman-sachs-has-four-charts-showing-the-huge-potential-in-virtual-and-augmented-reality\">has estimated</a> that by 2025, the VR industry could be worth $80-$182bn.</p> <h2>A big ethical question</h2> <p>To understand the importance of VR in our future, we need to think of it not as an industry but as an interface, a new way of interacting with the world. We\u2019ve gone from desktops to mobile computing; the next step-change is VR. It can be hard to see this now: VR is still in its infancy and can be easily dismissed as gimmicky, or just for gamers. However, as the technology scales, the potential of VR is enormous. It could change our economy, our media, and how we live our lives. </p> <p>What excites people about VR is its immersiveness. VR doesn\u2019t just give you the opportunity of being in other places, it lets you put yourself in other people\u2019s shoes. As such, it\u2019s often been described as an \u201cempathy machine\u201d.</p> <p>Jeremy Bailenson, director of Stanford University\u2019s Virtual Human Interaction Lab, has said that \u201cfeeling prejudice by walking a mile in someone else\u2019s shoes is what VR was made for\u201d. Charities are leveraging VR\u2019s empathy equity to help people understand what it\u2019s like to be a refugee. The NFL is using it for diversity training. As such, VR has enormous potential for good. But, as Belamire\u2019s experience also illustrates, it also has potential for very real harm. Think about the harassment that women and minorities are routinely subject to online today. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>To understand VR, we need to think of it not as an industry, but as a new way of interacting with the world</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Now think about that in virtual reality. If we\u2019re not careful we could end up amplifying the divides and inequality in the real world in a virtual one; we could effectively make VR a no-go area for anyone who isn\u2019t a privileged straight white man.</p> <p>If we want virtual reality to have a positive impact on our actual reality, we need to start designing for this now, anticipating the potential for harassment and discrimination in VR and finding ways to stop them. We need to avoid the mistakes that were made when social media networks were developed. </p> <p>The most important way to do that is ensuring that the people who are creating VR technology and content are from a diverse set of backgrounds. After all, what we get out of VR depends on what we put into it.</p> <p>Amelia Winger-Bearskin, a technologist, says we are at a turning point with VR \u201cwhere the way we interact computationally with the world is going to shift. If we don\u2019t have diverse people in the beginning of that conversation then we will just increase this gulf that we have between people who are able to be part of that conversation and those who aren\u2019t.\u201d</p> <h2>A bug in the matrix</h2> <p>Diversity has been a bug that an overwhelmingly white, male Silicon Valley has been trying to fix for several years, so far unsuccessfully. Defending themselves against their dismal diversity numbers, tech companies often like to focus on the \u201cpipeline\u201d problem: that there simply aren\u2019t enough skilled minorities to hire in the first place. </p> <p>However, they don\u2019t have that excuse with virtual reality. Because VR is in its infancy, it\u2019s still a fairly flat playing field when it comes to who is equipped to break into it. We\u2019ve got a chance to fix that pipeline from its start. And, to be fair, tech companies seem to be rising to the occasion. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/apr/04/techies-photography-project-silicon-valley-diversity-helena-price\">Picturing 'techies': photo project captures the unseen diversity of Silicon Valley</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Earlier this year Oculus, the Facebook-owned VR company, announced a diversity program called Launch Pad to attract the development efforts of \u201cwomen, people of color, members of the LGBTQ community\u201d. Winger-Bearskin was selected to be one of around 100 Launch Pad fellows and took part in a virtual reality bootcamp in May. Since then Oculus has mentored the fellows via online forums and will be announcing scholarships for select fellows in the next couple weeks. </p> <p>Apart from a spate of food poisoning that, one fellow told me, had large numbers of the diversity fellows violently vomiting in the Facebook bathrooms during the bootcamp, all seemed to be going very well with the Launch Pad program. Many of the fellows praised it as an example of how Silicon Valley should be thinking about and going about diversity. Diversity programs can often feel superficial or tokenistic but Launch Pad \u201cdidn\u2019t feel like a charity\u201d, said Aliah Darke, a diversity fellow. \u201cIt felt like \u2018we have all these questions in VR and we need as many people solving these questions as possible\u2019. It felt like they understood the value of diversity in helping to come up with novel ideas.\u201d </p> <p>Then on 22 September, news broke that Palmer Luckey, Oculus\u2019s founder, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/sep/23/oculus-palmer-luckey-funding-trump-reddit-trolls\">had been secretly funding</a> a pro-Trump organization called Nimble America, a shady organization (which has now erased itself from the internet) dedicated to swaying the election Trump\u2019s way through \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/sep/23/oculus-rift-vr-palmer-luckey-trump-shitposts\">shitposting</a>\u201d. </p> <p>This basically involves troll armies overwhelming online conversations with inane memes. The idea being to derail conversations and, therefore, shut people up. It\u2019s the opposite of an open internet. It\u2019s the opposite of empathy.</p> <h2>Hitting back at the bro-gammer culture</h2> <p>Many people in the VR community look up to Luckey, idolize him even. He is a wunderkind who developed a groundbreaking VR headset in his parents\u2019 basement then sold it to Facebook for $2bn in 2014. He\u2019s one of the most influential people in VR, and he\u2019s only just turned 24. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"6adb00c4fca7a87af4656e009f48904e40127a8f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6adb00c4fca7a87af4656e009f48904e40127a8f/0_0_870_1157/752.jpg\" alt=\"Palmer Luckey, the founder of Oculus Rift, on the cover of Time magazine.\" width=\"752\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Palmer Luckey, the founder of Oculus Rift, on the cover of Time magazine.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Time magazine</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The idea that he might be aligned with the alt-right, a group that has been vocal in its hatred for many marginalized groups, caused widespread dismay. </p> <p>Some developers said they would boycott Oculus as a platform. A number of the diversity fellows started to wonder how serious Oculus really was about diversity. </p> <p>It didn\u2019t help that, shortly after the news about Luckey broke, Amy Thole, Oculus\u2019s diversity manager, emailed Launch Pad participants to say she was leaving the company. She was replaced by Ebony Peay, who had spent two years at Oculus as an executive assistant. It\u2019s not clear whether this had anything to do with Luckey; neither Thole nor Peay responded to multiple requests for comment. Shortly after, Oculus also announced that it was delaying the announcement of the Launch Pad scholarship and the fellows have been frustrated at the lack of communication from Oculus since.</p> <p>Some of the diversity fellows began to wonder whether it would feel right taking Oculus\u2019s money anyway. Darke wasn\u2019t one of these people. \u201cMy answer was, taking money from powerful white men that I disagree with is my happy place,\u201d she told me over Skype. \u201cI don\u2019t think that marginalized people should deny themselves opportunities because of something foolish that a young white guy did.\u201d</p> <p>The problem, however, is whether marginalized people might end up being denied opportunities because of something a privileged white guy did. When influential people align themselves with extreme views, they help normalize them. </p> <p>Jeris JC Miller, who at 60 is one of the oldest fellows on the Launch Pad, told me she believes that Luckey\u2019s actions set \u201ca precedent that misogyny, sexism, racism, implied racism is OK\u201d. This has real ramifications on the working culture in tech which has a knock-on effect in diversity in tech and VR. \u201cIt\u2019s really challenging to live and create in a bro-grammer culture. It\u2019s hard. There\u2019s an ethos and an ethic and a style of relating that in many cases is quite painful for women and minorities.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Palmer Luckey's actions set a precedent that misogyny, sexism, racism, implied racism is OK</p> <footer> <cite>Jeris JC Miller, Facebook diversity fellow</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Of course, Luckey is just one man. While he appears to still be employed by Oculus (neither Facebook nor Oculus responded to repeated requests for comment) he doesn\u2019t necessarily represent their values, as Luckey made clear in an apology he posted after the news first broke. </p> <p>What\u2019s more, at the Oculus Connect developer conference earlier this month \u2013 from which Luckey was conspicuously absent \u2013 Oculus (and by extension Facebook) announced it would be spending $10m to fund diversity programs for VR.</p> <p>At the same time that Facebook is throwing money at diversity and distancing itself from Luckey, however, it has found itself dealing with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/oct/18/donald-trump-peter-thiel-support-facebook\">Peter Thiel\u2019s support of Trump</a>. Thiel, an influential board member of Facebook, recently gave $1.25m to the Republican presidential nominee. As this donation came in the wake of multiple sexual assaults allegations against the nominee, it was construed by some as condoning Trump\u2019s actions. </p> <p>Mark Zuckerberg has stood by Thiel; defending Thiel\u2019s donation in an internal Facebook post, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/oct/19/peter-thiel-support-donald-trump-mark-zuckerberg\">framing it as a question of \u201cdiversity\u201d</a>. Diversity of points of view, he said, was as important as diversity of background.</p> <p>Zuckerberg\u2019s reframing of diversity is worrying sophistry. Everyone is entitled to their viewpoint, of course. But most people don\u2019t have the resources, power and influence that the likes of Thiel and Luckey do. </p> <p>These are the people at the helm of building the infrastructure of tomorrow, who are leveraging technology to create a virtual world to their tastes. If Trump loses in November, his followers may well just build an alternative Trumpmenistan in the virtual world. And that will have a real effect on us all.</p>",
  "<p>News that gymnast Louis Smith <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/nov/01/louis-smith-banned-british-gymnastics-video-mocking-islam\" title=\"\">has been suspended by his governing body</a> for mocking Islam is so 2016. I don\u2019t want to bang on about the auto\u2011satirical state we\u2019re in, but this is basically the blasphemy law being revived by British Gymnastics. It\u2019s certainly one in the eye for parliament, which abolished the offence of blasphemy in 2008 \u2013 but perhaps those outplayed politicians can now retaliate by arbitrarily changing the scoring system for the uneven bars.</p> <p>By way of a recap, Smith and his fellow gymnast Luke Carson <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/10/olympic-gymnast-louis-smith-apology-luke-carson\" title=\"\">were filmed at a wedding shouting Allahu Akbar</a> and mimicking a prayer pose, and the video found its way to the Sun last month. Smith has since apologised profusely, and accrued the standard death threats and summons to appear on Loose Women. But following a high\u2011level inquiry into the incident at the Kettering nuptials, British Gymnastics has suspended him for two months. Announcing the decision on Tuesday, it declared solemnly: \u201cAs the custodians of the integrity and values of the sport, we have had no choice but to act responsibly.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/nov/01/louis-smith-banned-british-gymnastics-video-mocking-islam\">Louis Smith lands British Gymnastics ban after video appearing to mock Islam</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Wait \u2013 the custodians of the integrity and values of gymnastics? What are those when they\u2019re at home? Perhaps, like me, you imagined gymnastics to be much as other sports, even if you do hold almost similar reservations about sports with human judges as you do about sports in which you can drink a pint while&#xa0;playing.</p> <p>Leaving those debates for another column (a column which I myself have written at least twice), sports are commonly agreed to be competitive physical activities. Capable of being inspiring, certainly, and frequently places where great spirit and whatnot is on display. But above all: sports. Not established value systems, and certainly not a forum for creating pseudo\u2011case law on free speech. To pretend otherwise is a dangerous category&#xa0;mistake.</p> <p>But that is exactly what British Gymnastics seems to be doing. I haven\u2019t been this troubled by insidious sport\u2011related behaviour since the pant-wetting petition to make the BBC <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2015/dec/08/tyson-fury-spoty-bbc-petition\" title=\"\">remove Tyson Fury\u2019s name from last year\u2019s Sports Personality of the Year shortlist</a>. That, at least, had the merit of being a petition, as opposed to the top\u2011down work of an authority that should know better.</p> <p>Then again, perhaps it is all of a piece. The same type of people who don\u2019t trust the public to vote for the right sublebrities in meaningless competitions also don\u2019t trust the public to be able to come to its own conclusions about an obviously stupid twat like Louis Smith. As I say, he is evidently a stupid twat (you could tell on Strictly, innit \u2013 and I\u2019m not even getting into the man-bun). Yet what is more satisfactory in a case where there is no reasonable evidence of incitement to violence: that grown-ups come to that judgment themselves? Or that British Gymnastics, of all post-parodic entities, enacts a de&#xa0;facto blasphemy law?</p> <p>It goes without saying that there is an even higher authority for their actions \u2013 namely, UK Sport, the high\u2011performance agency whose rulebook states that athletes may be ineligible for funding if they are \u201cderogatory about a person\u2019s disability, gender, pregnancy or maternity, race, sexuality, marital status, beliefs or age (this is not an exhaustive list)\u201d.</p> <p>Isn\u2019t it? Because once it put \u201cbeliefs\u201d in, it pretty much covered any possible base. What if an athlete was of the belief that The Life of Brian was an excellent movie, or that Father Ted was hilarious? Naturally, something tells me mocking mass would be rather less frowned upon than mocking the call to prayer. But why on earth can\u2019t athletes be derogatory about people\u2019s beliefs?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/oct/19/gianni-infantino-fifa-world-cup-48-teams\">Gianni Infantino and Fifa seem to have a new plan: to kill the World Cup | Marina Hyde</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This is one of those debates where it sharpens the focus to consider the individuals lining up on each side. First out of the traps to condemn Smith was one Mohammed Shafiq of the Ramadan Foundation, who was prominently featured in the Sun\u2019s coverage, denouncing Smith for his behaviour. \u201cIt\u2019s outrageous somebody can mock any faith,\u201d Shafiq declared \u2013 except, of course, that it isn\u2019t. Indeed, the opposite is true. It would be outrageous if any faith couldn\u2019t be mocked \u2013 and if any faith was so great, being mocked wouldn\u2019t matter to them. Lest his point be misunderstood, however, Mr Shafiq took care to repeat it, declaring: \u201cOur faith is not to be mocked.\u201d</p> <p>So who is Mohammed Shafiq? His most eye-catching claim to fame arguably came in 2014, after Maajid Nawaz \u2013 a Muslim who runs anti\u2011extremist thinktank the Quilliam Foundation \u2013 tweeted a cartoon featuring Jesus and Mohammed greeting each other in friendly fashion. Shafiq\u2019s formal response was stark: he declared the Quilliam Foundation a defamer of the prophet (a charge which can provoke Islamists to kill) and added such <em>billets doux</em> as: \u201cWe will notify all Muslim organisations in the UK of his despicable behaviour and also notify all Islamic countries.\u201d Well, you get the idea with that one. After a year of being needled about this by some, including the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jan/25/liberal-democrats-t-shirt-jesus-muhammad-religion\" title=\"\">Observer\u2019s estimable Nick Cohen</a>, Shafiq finally apologised, and claimed to have \u201clearnt a huge lesson\u201d. Not that huge a one, it seems, if he still regards lame-arse mockery of any faith as on the banned list.</p> <p>As for British Gymnastics, it doesn\u2019t appear to be anywhere near learning any useful lessons \u2013 but then, it takes its lead from the benighted fools at UK&#xa0;Sport, who bang on about the privilege of representing a country at the same time as cravenly denying that country\u2019s essential freedoms. In many ways, it\u2019s an old hypocrisy. Governing bodies have long come down like a ton of bricks on any athlete who gets political \u2013 yet I can scarcely think of anything more absurdly political than British Gymnastics operating a blasphemy law.</p>",
  "<p>With the presidential election one week away, a handful of Republicans are already vowing to oppose any nominee to the supreme court proposed by Hillary Clinton should she be elected.</p> <p>At least three Republican senators have voiced support for indefinitely blocking Clinton from filling the supreme court vacancy left by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/13/antonin-scalia-dead-us-supreme-court-justice-obituary\">the late justice Antonin Scalia</a>, thus breaking with a 150-year precedent for having nine justices serving on the nation\u2019s highest bench.</p> <p>Senators Ted Cruz, of Texas; John McCain, of Arizona; and Richard Burr, of North Carolina have all suggested leaving Scalia\u2019s seat open if Clinton reaches the White House. Cruz, in particular, argued there was a \u201clong historical precedent\u201d for having fewer than nine justices on the supreme court.</p> <p>Senate Republican leaders have yet to hold a hearing or a vote on Merrick Garland, who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2016/mar/16/obama-nominates-merrick-garland-supreme-court-dc-appeals-court-judge\">was nominated by Barack Obama to replace Scalia in March</a>. Republicans justified their refusal to move forward on the Garland nomination by saying the next president should fill the vacancy. But as Donald Trump\u2019s path to the White House narrows, a potential split is emerging within the party ranks on how to proceed when Congress returns after the election for a lame duck session.</p> <p>Florida senator Marco Rubio, for example, was not willing to go as far as Cruz and his other colleagues when asked by the Guardian if he supported an indefinite blockade under a prospective Clinton presidency.</p> <p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t believe that we should do that if they propose nominees that are good,\u201d Rubio, who ran unsuccessfully for the Republican presidential nomination, said in an interview last week. \u201cI\u2019m not going to go and predispose them that way.\u201d</p> <p>Rubio\u2019s response came with the caveat, however, that he found it unlikely Clinton would nominate an individual who shared his view of the role of the court.</p> <p>\u201cIf it\u2019s someone good who understands that their job is to apply the constitution, according to its original intent, then that will be a welcome surprise,\u201d he said. \u201cBut barring whether it\u2019s Republican or a Democrat, if they appoint someone who I believe doesn\u2019t meet that standard I\u2019ll oppose that nominee.\u201d</p> <p>Rubio, facing a tighter than expected re-election battle in Florida, has not met with Garland and has expressed his opposition to Obama\u2019s nomination.</p> <p>Burr, who is locked in a dead heat for his own re-election in North Carolina, made a far more declarative statement on how he would treat a supreme court nominee under Clinton.</p> <p>\u201cIf Hillary Clinton becomes president, I am going to do everything I can do to make sure four years from now, we still got an opening on the supreme court,\u201d Burr told Republican volunteers in a private meeting, according to leaked audio <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/31/politics/richard-burr-hillary-clinton-gun-owners/index.html\">first reported by CNN</a>.</p> <p>McCain, another vulnerable incumbent Republican, similarly vowed to oppose any nominee under Clinton last month, stating in a radio show interview: \u201cI promise you that we will be united against any supreme court nominee that Hillary Clinton, if she were president, would put up. I promise you.\u201d</p> <p>McCain later <a href=\"http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/politics/ct-john-mccain-hillary-clinton-supreme-court-20161017-story.html\">walked back his pledge</a> when faced with criticism.</p> <p>McCain\u2019s colleague from Arizona, Senator Jeff Flake, has adopted a far more conciliatory tone by calling on Republicans to move forward with the Garland nomination in the lame duck session if Clinton is elected.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a difference between what might be constitutional and what you could do politically and what you should do,\u201d Flake <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/10/republicans-split-supreme-court-vacancy-230395\">told Politico</a>. \u201cAnd I think leaving a vacancy for up to four years is not why we\u2019re here.</p> <p>\u201cIt may be what becomes a litmus test if you\u2019re a true conservative \u2026 Just to go on record, I won\u2019t be part of that.\u201d</p> <p>Chuck Grassley, the Iowa senator who chairs the Senate judiciary committee, also rejected the proposed tactics of blanket opposition.</p> <p>\u201cIf that new president happens to be Hillary, we can\u2019t just simply stonewall,\u201d Grassley told reporters on a conference call last month.</p> <p>Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, has also reaffirmed his belief that the next president should fill the vacancy left by Scalia.</p> <p>The White House sharply criticized Republicans proposing a smaller supreme court bench under Clinton. Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, said such an approach was \u201cthe same kind of dysfunction that has infected Washington for the last six years\u201d.</p> <p>Public opinion of the supreme court reveals a fairly even ideological split in its favorability and how it should interpret the constitution. But a majority of the American public has expressed <a href=\"http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/09/26/5-facts-about-the-supreme-court/\">disagreement</a> with the decision by Republicans to not hold a hearing on Garland\u2019s nomination.</p>",

  "<p>I am sad to record the death of Lionel Morrison, aged 81, a tireless activist for the National Union of Journalists and for the cause of black people.</p> <p>I am unsure whether he was the first black journalist in Fleet Street, but I cannot recall another who worked for a national popular newspaper in the early 1970s. </p> <p>He was certainly the NUJ\u2019s first black president, having been elected to the post in 1987, and worked hard for the union for more than 40 years. </p> <p>I think Seamus Dooley, the NUJ\u2019s assistant general secretary, summed up his character well in noting that he <a href=\"https://www.nuj.org.uk/news/nuj-pays-tribute-to-lionel-morris/\">\u201cmade a remarkable impression on all who met him\u201d</a>.</p> <p>He sure did. Quiet, persistent and patient, he preferred to argue his case one-to-one, face-to-face rather than ranting from the microphone. </p> <p>I had met him several times before I knew anything of his background in South Africa, where he was born in 1935.</p> <p>At 21, he was the youngest of the 155 people to face the court in the infamous treason trial that resulted in the jailing of Nelson Mandela and Walter Sisulu.<br></p> <p>Morrison, who had previously spent five months in Johannesburg\u2019s notorious prison, The Fort, for his opposition to apartheid, was acquitted.</p> <p>While working as a reporter for the Golden City Post, South Africa\u2019s first black weekly, he helped to found the South African National Union of Journalists, a non-racial organisation in contrast to the whites-only South African Society of Journalists.</p> <p>Following the 1960 <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharpeville_massacre\">Sharpeville massacre</a>, he went into exile. He spent time in Europe, Asia and Africa, helping to found the Afro-Asian Journalists Association, before beginning to look for work in Britain in 1968.</p> <p>According to <a href=\"http://www.voice-online.co.uk/article/lionel-morrison-journey-sa-prison-nuj-president\">an interview in The Voice</a> a couple of years ago, he said he wrote to nearly 100 newspaper and magazine editors without success. Few agreed to see him, and he believed he was rejected because of the colour of his skin. </p> <p>Interviews came and went until he met Bob Edwards, editor of The People, who took him on, initially to cover a story about the Mangrove restaurant in Notting Hill. It ended up with the paper being sued, but Morrison was praised by the judge for his work and the way he gave his evidence.</p> <p>He went on to work, as both reporter and subeditor, at the London Evening Standard, Sunday Telegraph and Sunday Mirror. </p> <p>During the 1970s, I recall his sensible, non-confrontational contributions to debates at NUJ London branch meetings. And in 1974, at the delegate meeting in Wexford, Ireland, members agreed to set up a race relations working party with Morrison as its first chair. </p> <p>Significantly, a year later, the union agreed to incorporate into its code of conduct the requirement that members should not \u201coriginate material which encourages discrimination on the grounds of race, colour, creed, gender or sexual orientation\u201d.</p> <p>In 1977, Morrison put himself forward for the NUJ presidency, later claiming that he lost out because of \u201cbloody racism\u201d. Ten years later, however, he was elected as president and spent his year addressing inequality in the media and in the NUJ.</p> <p>Later, he played a key role in establishing the <a href=\"https://www.nuj.org.uk/rights/george-viner-memorial-fund/\">George Viner Memorial Fund</a>, a charity trust that aids black journalism students, helping to address the problem of there being a disproportionately low number of black journalists working in the UK.</p> <p>Morrison went on to work for the Commission for Racial Equality. As he told The Voice\u2019s interviewer: \u201cWhen things are wrong, you have got to do something about it\u201d.</p> <p>In a tribute to Morrison, Michelle Stanistreet, the NUJ\u2019s general secretary, spoke of his enormous impact on the union and \u201chis passion and commitment to journalism and to social justice and equality\u201d. </p> <p>And Jim Boumelha, who was to become the second black president of the NUJ, said: \u201cHe will be remembered for the countless struggles he led... [He was] a passionate and eloquent voice for the cause of justice\u201d.</p> <p>The NUJ is planning to publish a fuller appreciation of Morrison in a few days. </p>",

You asked Google \u2013 here\u2019s the answer | Kate Carter</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But while weight-loss is a goal coveted by many runners, it is not always easy to achieve. Theoretically, it seems straightforward. Roughly speaking, losing 0.45kg involves burning off 3,500 calories, the equivalent of about 35 miles of running. But it rarely works out quite so simply.<br></p> <p>One of the reasons is that, the more you exercise, the more the body naturally tries to compensate by altering your metabolism through a series of evolutionary-based protective mechanisms \u2013 first <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7211534\">highlighted around 40 years ago </a>\u2013 which are designed to prevent starvation and indefinite weight loss.<br></p> <p>\u201cThe human body has a pretty good capability for regulating its bodyweight,\u201d says Glenn Gaesser, professor of exercise science at Arizona State University. \u201cWe all have a set-point range for our weight and, while the average person may consume three-quarters of a million calories per year, from year to year we weigh pretty much the same thing unless something happens that greatly distorts our lifestyle, such as a purposeful weight-loss diet, or some sort of tragic event that changes our behaviour.\u201d<br></p> <p>Following exercise,<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25323965\"> a range of small but significant compensatory processes</a> kicks in that resist the intended energy deficit. Changes take place within the body\u2019s tissue that reduce resting metabolic rate, especially during sleep, and as weight decreases, you burn calories less efficiently the next time you exercise. This seems to be particularly the case if a runner cuts their calorific intake at the same time as embarking on a new exercise regime.<br></p> <p>In addition, <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23470300\">there are certain psychological and behavioural changes that also combine to undermine attempts to shed weight</a>. Many of us tend to overestimate the number of calories we have actually burned through exercise and <a href=\"http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0004515\">increase our energy intake</a>, either consciously or subconsciously. This is one of the reasons why some people are dismayed to find that they have put on weight despite taking up running. Gaesser says it has been found that people who had watched promotional exercise videos tended to consume more calories than they would normally, despite having not done any exercise themselves.\u201d</p> <p>This is because exercise is thought to influence our eating behaviour by modulating both the pleasure we get from eating and the drive to eat, known as the body\u2019s<a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1038/oby.2007.164/full\"> hedonic response to food</a>. While, in the long term, exercise is thought to help hone our appetite regulatory system, making it easier to cut down on snacking and instead eat at set times of the day, in the short term vigorous exercise stimulates brain areas associated with reward and dependence. This makes us crave high-fat, energy-dense foods, which can negate the beneficial effects of a running regime.<br></p> <p>But perhaps the most common reason people don\u2019t lose always lose the weight they expect to through running, is that, post-run, they simply slow down during the rest of the day. It is a trend many scientists have observed by fitting runners attempting to lose weight with motion sensors or heart-rate monitors.<br></p> <p>\u201cPeople often subconsciously modify their behaviour,\u201d Gaesser says. \u201cThere are studies that show that when people take part in a structured programme of 30-40 minutes\u2019 running, three to five days a week, outside of the structured activity, some simply don\u2019t do as much throughout the day as they would normally do. Usually, they would naturally get in around 7,000 steps a day through regular activities, but during the running regime that might fall to 4,000-5,000 steps. And you can see that the people who had the biggest decrease in their spontaneous activity during the rest of the day are the ones who don\u2019t lose as much weight as they were anticipating.\u201d<br></p> <p>Gaesser recommends that runners wanting to lose weight invest in an activity monitor so they can check that they are still maintaining the same number of steps and overall activity when they are not running. But it is also possible to boost your chances of burning more calories by adapting your running regime to include more high-intensity training.<br></p> <p>Some runners experience an initial boost of weight loss before finding that the rewards plateau over time, despite their best efforts. \u201cIt\u2019s not a clear-cut relationship between calories and weight loss,\u201d Gaesser says. \u201cSo if you triple your calorie expenditure by running, you won\u2019t necessarily triple your weight loss. It works to a point, but then there does seem to be an upper ceiling as your body\u2019s metabolism adapts and resists. There is recent evidence to suggest that really high-intensity interval training can stimulate the metabolic rate to remain elevated for periods of time after exercise, which encourages weight loss as you continue to burn calories even when resting. But we don\u2019t yet know whether that continues to work over a timespan of months and years.\u201d<br></p> <p>However, the sort of high-intensity training Gaesser is referring to requires pushing yourself to up to 80% of your VO2 max, the maximum volume of oxygen you can consume, over a period of at least an hour. This is far harder than many people are willing to push themselves.<br></p> <p>But overall, science still indicates that if you want to lose weight, running is one of the better option as it uses a lot of big-muscle groups, key for calorie burning. In stark contrast, swimming tends to perform worst in studies, as the temperature differences in the water mean you lose a lot of heat. The end product is that body fat losses tend to be somewhat neutralised.<br></p> <p>But as for how running shapes up to other activities in terms of weight loss, we simply don\u2019t know. \u201cWe don\u2019t know whether running is superior to cycling or rowing or even cross-country skiing in terms of optimal body-fat loss because there simply isn\u2019t that data available,\u201d Gaesser says. \u201cBut it\u2019s superior to walking simply because you can run at a higher level of energy expenditure and still have the same level of physiological and perceived effort. So it\u2019s a more efficient way to expend those calories.\u201d<br></p>",

  "<h2>Clinton forges ahead as campaign dismisses polling</h2> <p>Clinton campaign officials have dismissed a poll suggesting that Donald Trump may have taken the lead in the final days before Tuesday\u2019s election, insisting they see no negative impact from Friday\u2019s new FBI email disclosures. A senior Clinton campaign official says a new ABC News/Washington Post tracking poll which put Trump one point ahead is \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/01/donald-trump-polls-lead-hillary-clinton-campaign\">not what we see at all</a>\u201d.

  "<p>They will have to focus on work-related reading rather relaxing with the latest thriller from James Patterson, but government employees in the United Arab Emirates are to be given \u201cdedicated time to read\u201d during work hours following a new law intended to \u201cmake reading a daily habit\u201d.<br></p> <p>Described as the first of its kind, the UAE\u2019s new \u201cnational law of reading\u201d was announced by UAE president, Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed al-Nahyan, earlier this week. It will allow government staff time to read at work \u2013 although they must focus on reading matter about professional and personal development within the context of the workplace.</p> <p>The law will also oblige coffee shops to offer reading material for their customers, said Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum, the <a href=\"http://sheikhmohammed.ae/en-us/Pages/NewsDetails.aspx\">UAE\u2019s vice-president and Dubai\u2019s ruler</a>, and will see branches of libraries opened in malls, as well as exempting books from fees and taxes.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.thenational.ae/uae/reading-during-working-hours-sheikh-mohammed-reveals-details-on-unprecedented-new-law\">The government-owned daily</a> the National reported Sheikh Mohammed saying: \u201cOur objective is to make reading a daily habit in our people, where relevant entities will be required to translate this law into reality,\u201d and calling the law an \u201cunprecedented cultural and legislative initiative\u201d that \u201cconsolidates the cultural image of books in the society\u201d. \u201cThe law takes a key value like reading and turns it in[to] an integrated government project,\u201d he added.</p> <p>The law will also see a \u201cknowledge briefcase\u201d, or reading bag, given to children. The bags will be provided at birth, one and two years, will be in Arabic for UAE nationals and Arab expatriates and in English for non-Arab expatriates. Expatriates are <a href=\"http://www.bq-magazine.com/economy/socioeconomics/2015/04/uae-population-by-nationality\">estimated to make up 90% </a>of the population.</p> <p>And it will mean that unwanted books cannot be destroyed, but must be \u201cpreserved, reused or donated\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe law will encourage the private sector to invest in the establishment of libraries and cultural centres. This will be done by providing the private sector with facilities, incentives and discounts,\u201d said Sheikh Mohammed, according to the National. \u201cOur goal is for 2016 to be the start of a sustainable cultural change among generations \u2013 a change that consolidates the importance of reading, celebrates knowledge and boosts the status of reading.\u201d</p> <p>Last week also marked the conclusion of the Arab Reading Challenge, which Sheikh Mohammed launched last September. It saw more than 150m books read by around 3.5m children from more than 20 countries, with participants competing for $3m-worth of prizes. Seven-year-old Mohammed Farah from Algeria won the top prize for students, taking home $150,000 (\u00a3122,000) in educational grants and cash, while the winning school in Nablus, Palestine, was given $1m.</p> <p>The challenge\u2019s success prompted the novelist Paulo Coelho to write to Sheikh Mohammed, telling him that \u201cby riding the vessels of knowledge, powered by the wind of reading, you will soon anchor on the shore of a very bright and prosperous future\u201d.</p> <p>Sheikh Mohammed replied that \u201cthere is no future without books\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWe have experienced a time when the people of our region focused on books. At that time, we were pioneers, leaders, open to all cultures. We became a beacon for humanity, and paved the way for the European Renaissance. Did you know, Paulo, that in the 9th century, our region had over 100 publishing houses on the outskirts of Baghdad alone? ... When its life was centred on books, Baghdad was, my friend, a beacon in the worlds of astronomy, medicine, mathematics and philosophy. Where is Baghdad today?\u201d he wrote to Coelho.</p> <p>\u201cI do not want to dwell too long on mentioning the profusion of other libraries \u2026 in Alexandria, Cairo, Andalusia, and Morocco. But what I do want to say is that we have learned a clear lesson: there is no future without books; no enlightenment or tolerance or co-existence, without books; no creativity or innovation or invention without books; no economic prosperity or pioneering or leadership.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>January feels like a long time ago. During the month, in the lead-up to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/sundance-2016\">Sundance</a> and the Oscars, there was a constant stream of articles about #OscarsSoWhite and the fact that for the second year in a row there were no actors of color nominated for the main awards. Step forward Nate Parker and his passion project The Birth of a Nation, a film that took him seven years to make and is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/12/hollywood-truth-better-fiction-birth-of-nation-nat-turner\">a far from historically accurate portrayal</a> of the rebel slave Nat Turner. It quickly became an award winner and a record setter when it was bought by Fox Searchlight for $17.5m.

  "<p>There are many things in football that are incredibly beautiful. Lionel Messi at full flow. A Dimitri Payet free-kick. Or, indeed, a simple toe poke, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9O3otJu2FWE\" title=\"\">such as Ronaldinho\u2019s against Chelsea back in 2005</a>.</p> <p>The list is long. We can marvel at warm-ups (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vashrNoXTE\" title=\"\">Diego Maradona with Opus in the background is a classic</a> ), crossfield passes or even sliding tackles. Not to mention nutmegs. Wonderful things.</p> <p>But for some reason we seem to find it more difficult to appreciate a clinical goalscorer. Take Miroslav Klose, the Germany striker <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/nov/01/miroslav-klose-retirement-germany-coaching-staff\" title=\"\">who announced his retirement</a> from football this week to go into coaching. He scored goals throughout his career: an astonishing 71 in 137 games for Germany, beating Gerd M\u00fcller\u2019s 40-year-old record in 2014 to become his country\u2019s best marksman of all time.</p> <p>He scored 121 times in the Bundesliga in 307 games for Kaiserslautern, Werder Bremen and Bayern Munich before adding another 55 goals in 139 appearances for Lazio in Serie A \u2013 an unstoppable, lanky goal machine who could be relied upon to win games week in, week out.</p> <p>Yet for all the goals he will never be considered as one of the best in the world by the wider public. It seems a little bit harsh because, after all, goals are the most important thing in football, the one thing that <em>actually</em> decides who wins a game.</p> <p>Klose\u2019s achievements, however, has probably been undermined by the fact that his goals \u2013 or in fact his whole game \u2013 were not all that aesthetically pleasing. His goals were tap-ins, they were close-range headers \u2013 they were scrappy.</p> <p>But to dismiss Klose\u2019s goals as ugly is to ignore the beauty of a goalpoacher\u2019s best attributes: finding space and anticipating where the ball will drop. Fewer and fewer players seem capable of appearing behind a defender\u2019s back to knock in the ball from two yards.</p> <p>There are exceptions of course and Javier Hern\u00e1ndez, whose Bayer Leverkusen face Tottenham Hotspur at Wembley in the Champions League on Wednesday night, is one of those players who has a wonderful sense of being in the right place at the right time.</p> <p>Hern\u00e1ndez is in his second season at Leverkusen now and has scored 22 times in 36 league games. This season he already has seven from 13 games in all competitions. And every time you look at those stats you wonder what on earth possessed Manchester United to first <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/sep/01/javier-hernandez-real-madrid-manchester-united-loan\" title=\"\">loan him out to Real Madrid</a> for the 2014-15 season and then <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/aug/31/javier-hernandez-manchester-united-bayer-leverkusen-move\" title=\"\">sell him to Leverkusen</a> the following summer. For \u00a37.3m.</p> <p>True, there were times when \u201cChicharito\u201d was given a chance in United\u2019s starting XI and did not impress but the overall figures from his time at Old Trafford are 59 goals in 156 games. That puts him in the top 10 of United strikers when it comes to goals per minutes in the league over the past 20 years. How Jos\u00e9 Mourinho could use a poacher with Hern\u00e1ndez\u2019s strike rate at the moment.</p> <p>Is Hern\u00e1ndez, too, a victim of football\u2019s inability to appreciate natural goalscorers? Would he have thrived at Old Trafford if Sir Alex Ferguson, David Moyes or Louis van Gaal had given him an extended run in the team? His performances for Leverkusen suggest he would have done.</p> <p>He arrives in London for the game against Spurs at Wembley as Leverkusen\u2019s focal point in attack, a threat to Mauricio Pochettino\u2019s hopes of making it through to the knockout phase. At Leverkusen he has finally found a home in Europe where he feels appreciated.</p> <p>The Leverkusen sporting director, Rudi V\u00f6ller, said after the Mexican\u2019s hat-trick against Mainz in September that \u201che certainly doesn\u2019t win every tackle but he has an incredible sense of where the ball will end up\u201d. His team-mate, Kevin Volland, who joined from Hoffenheim in the summer, said: \u201cI have never seen a player who is so good in front of goal.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f955021ff55558ac5865174d58b3e376070f7ef9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f955021ff55558ac5865174d58b3e376070f7ef9/19_212_3886_2331/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Javier Hern\u00e1ndez\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Javier Hern\u00e1ndez is \u2018a much more complete player than people think\u2019, according to the Bayer Leverkusen manager Roger Schmidt.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Roberto Pfeil/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>That is not to say that the Leverkusen manager, Roger Schmidt, allows Hern\u00e1ndez just to wait around in the opposition\u2019s penalty area for the ball to drop. In the 2-2 draw against CSKA Moscow earlier this season Schmidt was furious with Hern\u00e1ndez and Hakan Calhanoglu for not helping out defensively and hauled them both off at half-time.</p> <p>But overall Schmidt could not be happier with his main goalscorer. \u201cThe goals are obviously important but he is a much more complete player than people think,\u201d he has said. \u201cHe works hard for the team and he goes deep to pick up the ball and has really clever movement.\u201d</p> <p>Hern\u00e1ndez, meanwhile, continues to work hard \u2013 and rely on his intuition. Asked in <a href=\"http://www.si.com/planet-futbol/2016/05/31/chicharito-mexico-javier-hernandez-bayer-leverkusen\" title=\"\">an excellent interview with Sports Illustrated</a> how he knows where to run in the penalty area, he said: \u201cIf you\u2019re inside the box and a cross is coming, sometimes you need, as we say in Spanish, to <em>smell</em> the intuition, to smell where the cross is going.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou play this sport in the mind, not only on the field,\u201d he added. \u201cOn crosses, sometimes I make my move one or two seconds before the ball is coming because I\u2019m trying to guess that the ball is coming there. It\u2019s intuition. So I run. Sometimes the ball comes \u2026 sometimes not. But that intuition is working.\u201d</p> <p>Hern\u00e1ndez, in fact, is a wonderful player to watch. Like Schmidt says, he makes the best possible runs to open up space for himself and for team-mates. Yet there are no fan-made compilations on YouTube of Hern\u00e1ndez\u2019s best runs or movements in the penalty area. Maybe there should be.</p>",

  "<p>A child in Blackpool is nearly eight times more likely to be in local authority care than one in Wokingham, Berkshire. A child in Wakefield is almost nine times more likely to be referred to social services than one little more than 30 miles away in York.</p> <p>These differences, to be found in Department for Education statistics and highlighted in a new <a href=\"https://www.nao.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Children-in-need-of-help-protection.pdf\">National Audit Office report</a>, are stark. Yet our understanding of them is still limited.</p> <p>Quite why a single care system, as in England, or similar ones across the UK produce such contrasts is the subject of a major academic inquiry involving seven universities that will be reporting interim findings at this week\u2019s National Children and Adult Services conference.</p> <p>Read through the ringbinder folders thick with referrals, assessments and court judgments that pile up once a council has applied to take a child into care, and you will soon start to form a pretty accurate idea of the family background in which that child has been living. But none of this rich contextual data is centrally recorded, says Paul Bywaters, professor of social work at Coventry University and leader of the inquiry. There exist instead just a few, bare facts about each year\u2019s cohort of looked-after children, such as age, gender and ethnicity.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/social-care-network/2016/nov/01/former-social-workers-come-back-to-the-fold\">Former social workers come back to the fold</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This means, Bywaters explains, that neither policy-makers nor researchers have been able to get a handle on the economic and social circumstances in which the families of these children come to the attention of social services.</p> <p>And so, unlike in health and education \u2013 where he says there is \u201ca strong understanding that there are deep inequalities relating to deprivation and ethnicity, and successive UK governments have adopted policies to reduce them\u201d \u2013 those interested in improving child protection policy and practice have, until now, been working blind. There has been no robust, comparative information on how a range of inequalities affects the way vulnerable children and families in the child protection system are treated by the state.</p> <p>This is despite the fact that there are what Bywaters calls \u201cprofound inequalities\u201d in the proportion of children on child protection plans or being looked-after in care, depending on their social background, their local area and which of the four UK countries they happen to live in.</p> <p>To take one example, the research team has calculated that, excluding those placed in their own homes, the proportion of children looked after in Scotland is about 70% higher than that in Wales and more than twice as high as that in either England or Northern Ireland.</p> <p>Arriving at such conclusions is no easy task for <a href=\"http://www.coventry.ac.uk/research/research-directories/current-projects/2014/child-welfare-inequality-uk/\">the team</a>, which is funded by the Nuffield Foundation: each of England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland has its own system of benchmarking deprivation, for example, so the team has had to construct its own index. It has then linked the index to council data broken down to small neighbourhoods of some 1,600 residents a time.</p> <p>Bywaters believes two broad, interacting factors lead to inequalities in the rates at which children are placed on child protection plans or removed entirely from their families: the level of abuse and neglect in society; and the framework of law, policy and services designed to tackle child protection.</p> <p>The former \u2013 the \u201cdemand\u201d side, as he puts it \u2013 is \u201cpowerfully affected by family economic circumstances\u201d. Parenting is obviously far harder when you have an inadequate or insecure income, or debts, or poor housing, or if you live in a difficult neighbourhood. </p> <p>The latter factor in the inequalities equation \u2013 the supply of supportive services, which influences decisions taken about families \u2013 is affected by national and local policy priorities; where and how scarce money is allocated and spent; professional and societal anxieties about risk; and the quantity and quality of staffing of services meant to help.</p> <p>This is research that\u2019s intended to make a difference. When the findings are published \u2013 the study is due to conclude next March \u2013 Bywaters hopes they will \u201cprompt the whole child protection system to pay much more attention to a family\u2019s economic circumstances\u201d.</p> <p>Dez Holmes, director of Research In Practice, a consultancy that advised on the initial phase of the research, urges policy-makers and professionals to recognise the pressures that poverty, compounded by austerity, places upon parents. \u201cWe need to acknowledge the interaction between poverty and other factors associated with child maltreatment, such as domestic abuse, mental ill-health and substance misuse,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen we ignore the role that poverty and, importantly, inequality play, we can find our discourse slips into blame, allowing us to distance ourselves from these \u2018bad parents\u2019 rather than recognising the wider responsibility we all have in preventing child maltreatment.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/social-care-network/2016/nov/01/the-three-conversations-model-turning-away-from-long-term-care\">The 'three conversations' model: turning away from long-term care</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Bywaters hopes the research will offer social care professionals and policy-makers building blocks to help understand the interplay between a family\u2019s specific difficulties, the help \u2013 or lack of it \u2013 from society and the deeply inequitable outcomes for children that can result.</p> <p>\u201cI want the whole child protection system to pay much more attention to a family\u2019s individual circumstances,\u201d he says. \u201cIn order to be able to respond properly to people\u2019s material lives, there need to be resources available. They need much more help in practical and financial ways, such as getting advice they need on benefits, debt, avoiding housing evictions \u2013 services that are increasingly rare around the country now.\u201d</p> <p>He also wants frontline workers to take full account in the assessment and decision-making process of \u201cjust how stressful it is on an hour-by-hour basis\u201d to be living in acute poverty. \u201cAssessment tools and time limits tend to militate against that,\u201d he observes. \u201cBecause instead of there being awareness of inequalities affecting a family\u2019s situation, the focus can be all on a decision about risk.\u201d</p> <p>Public attitudes on how best to protect children who do face significant risk in their homes may be shifting somewhat. The latest annual NSPCC report, <a href=\"https://www.nspcc.org.uk/services-and-resources/research-and-resources/2016/how-safe-are-our-children-2016/\">How Safe are our Children?</a>, shows that although 31% of the public believe the most important response to neglect and abuse should be to remove children from the situation, 29% say more should be done to reduce poverty \u2013 an increase of nine percentage points since 2013. Bywaters believes there is an urgent need for a similar shift of attitude at the top.</p> <p>\u201cIn the [social care] sector, in England, from government downwards, I think there\u2019s been a reluctance at policy level to recognise poverty and deprivation as central factors in child protection,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s one reason we\u2019re pleased there has been so much interest in our work from policy-makers and managers to frontline practitioners.</p> <p>\u201cBut the more we learn from our research, the more we realise that an inequalities perspective raises fundamental questions about many aspects of child protection systems: law and policies, data systems, funding mechanisms, staff training, assessment and decision-making processes and inspection measures. Child protection is extremely complex, but these questions compel us to examine inequalities in the system so that children and their parents have a better chance of living less damaging lives.\u201d</p> <h2>An accident of birth? </h2> <p>Kate Morris, professor of social work at the University of Sheffield, is leading a team scrutinising both professionals\u2019 decision-making and outcomes for children in a variety of comparable neighbourhoods. Participating in the first wave are one Scottish and two English councils \u2013 the second wave will focus on another three councils. </p> <p>\u201cWe are developing a detailed understanding of each of those sites in terms of referral rates and the probability of children ending up being assessed or looked after,\u201d says Morris.</p> <p>The researchers ask focus groups of social workers and independent reviewing officers in each local authority a set of questions about how they would react to events in a case study family\u2019s life. This is an attempt to establish \u201chow poverty and deprivation is understood and responded to by social workers in the frontline of child protection\u201d, says Morris.</p> <p>The researchers are also embedded inside children\u2019s services departments, undertaking practice observations, sitting in on case conferences and listening as duty calls are taken and reacted to. \u201cWe are seeing how the chances for families of being assessed and entering the child protection system are different across those local authorities, and seeing the differences in the ways that poverty is described, discussed and the weight that\u2019s given to it,\u201d Morris explains. By raising awareness of their findings, the research group hopes to make local authorities conscious of the scale of variation that exists in child protection.</p> <p>As well as looking at the professionals\u2019 point of view, researchers will be working with some families who have been subject to referrals, to examine their experiences of the system. </p>",

But it is doubtful he envisaged that algorithms used by search engines, social media platforms and websites would be after you to \u2018personalise your experience\u2019. Consequently, perhaps, personalisation and privacy have taken a new direction with the shift to messaging as the go-to communication platform.</p> <p>Search and social media platforms derive their income from advertising, so it makes sense for them to tailor what users see.

Tailoring content to user preferences potentially compromises online research. Search engines and ad networks are fingerprinting devices in real time, so it is impossible to know how neutral your search results are. And because search results are based on browsing history, we are less likely to see something new. Added to this is the platforms\u2019 own bias. The past few weeks have seen reports of Facebook\u2019s selective news curation and <a href=\"https://sputniknews.com/us/201609121045214398-google-clinton-manipulation-election/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Google\u2019s perceived political bias</a> towards Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential candidacy.</p> <p>Josh Sutton, global head of data and AI at Publicis Sapient, believes that transparency is the key as it enables people to make a well-informed judgement call. \u201cTrust is enabled by transparency\u201d he explains. \u201cThere has been an implicit bias in our communications since the invention of the printing press, and we accepted this because we could assess the people who were creating and curating content. I believe that a similar opportunity must be provided in the age of machine learning by enabling people to understand the sources of the algorithms and the training data that powers them.\u201d</p> <p>But we cannot blame the personalisation phenomenon entirely on algorithms. It is also a conscious choice. As social media has matured \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/2016/10/twitters-woes-signal-end-social-wars/?mbid=nl_101116_p2&amp;CNDID=43693487\" rel=\"nofollow\">and perhaps peaked</a> \u2013 we have become adept at blocking what we don\u2019t want to see \u2013 or don\u2019t agree with.

  "<p>My how far we\u2019ve come in less than eight years. We have seen happen what those of us in the climate and energy fields knew could happen. The US has become a world leader on climate change, dramatically increased our production of clean and renewable fuels, reduced our emissions of greenhouse gases, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2015/dec/14/the-paris-agreement-signals-that-deniers-have-lost-the-climate-wars\">signed major international agreements</a> to continue progress into the future, and have done so without cost increases or power disruptions that the denial community proclaimed would occur.</p> <p>As we in the United States get ready to elect a new president, it is helpful to think about the impact a president can have. Particularly since we transitioned from the worst climate president ever (Bush) to the best (Obama). I am going to detail what I think are Obama\u2019s signature accomplishments.</p> <p>In my mind, the most important part of President Obama\u2019s legacy on climate is that he changed the conversation. He showed that not only should the US play a role in reducing emissions, but we can do just that. He showed that this problem isn\u2019t too big to solve. In fact, most of the solutions are subtle enough that we don\u2019t even notice them. He showed that we can change our future for the better.</p> <p>With respect to specific actions, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2013/jun/25/climate-change-carbon-emissions-president-obama-epa\">Clean Power Plan</a> is one of his biggest accomplishments. By working with the EPA, he created the first ever carbon pollution standards for the largest source of pollution \u2013 power plants. He did this in the midst of a do-nothing congress that fought him every step of the way.</p> <p>Under his presidency, we made huge investments in clean energy, which are paying off already. Jump starts to the wind and solar industry have led to enormous cost decreases \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2016/oct/03/doe-charts-show-why-climate-doom-and-gloom-isnt-needed\">dirty energy isn\u2019t cheaper anymore</a>. It is really astonishing \u2013 wind power has tripled and solar power has increased by 30 times since he took office. <br></p> <p>Under his presidency, we improved standards for fuel economy of our vehicles, which not only reduces pollution but also saves money. Furthermore, Obama set targets to reduce the federal government\u2019s emissions by nearly 20% by 2025. He has worked to reduce other types of greenhouse gases such as methane and <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/15/climate-change-environmentalists-hail-deal-to-limit-use-of-hydrofluorocarbons\">hydrofluorocarbons</a>, not only within the US but through international agreements.</p> <p>And those aren\u2019t the only international efforts. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2014/nov/14/fact-check-china-pledged-bigger-climate-action-republican-leaders-wrong\">Obama made a joint plan with China</a> that is almost unbelievably ambitious. It will reduce our emissions by approximately 27% by 2025 and puts major limits on Chinese emissions as well. He also forged an agreement with India to help low-income countries transition to modern economies that are not as polluting as current developed nations.</p> <p>There are many more items which would be too numerous to mention but I wanted to know how his presidency is viewed within Washington DC. I mean, among climate scientists, he is the president we\u2019ve been waiting for, but what do legislators think? I asked representative <a href=\"https://mccollum.house.gov/\">Betty McCollum</a> from Minnesota for her view. Ms. McCollum has a long history of focusing on the environment in general and climate change in particular \u2013 long before it was popular. She told me:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><em>President Obama has acted boldly to address the threat of climate change at home and abroad. He has demonstrated American leadership on the world stage in forging the Paris agreement and the Kigali amendment, steps that would have been unthinkable under his predecessor. And, using existing law, President Obama has helped shape a new approach to domestic carbon emissions with the Clean Power Plan. Sadly, Republicans in Congress have consistently put polluters ahead of our planet and attempted to stymie every administration initiative on climate change. That has made President Obama\u2019s job tougher \u2013 and it makes his accomplishments on climate even more impressive.</em></p> </blockquote> <p>We are certainly not out of the woods yet on climate change. We cannot stop climate change entirely. But, what the last eight years have shown is that we can do really meaningful things that will reduce the impact. If the US can go from world laggard to world leader in just one presidency, imagine what else is possible.</p>",

It brings decision-makers and influencers together in the hope of inspiring them to tackle poverty and homelessness, as well as raising money.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"f36fedf575fa2a9d33109e2c863be0bdf104ead8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f36fedf575fa2a9d33109e2c863be0bdf104ead8/0_59_960_960/500.jpg\" alt=\"Gon\u00e7alves, chief executive of the League Against Cruel Sports, in his suit before Monday\u2019s sleepout.\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gon\u00e7alves, chief executive of the League Against Cruel Sports, in his suit before Monday\u2019s sleepout.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: League Against Cruel Sports</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Tackling homelessness needs decisive action from leaders like never before. Numbers of homeless people have doubled since 2010, and more than 40% have a diagnosed mental illness. Many are on the streets because of their condition, and will find it even harder to access the care and support they need there.</p> <p>I also believe \u2013 to borrow and misuse a phrase \u2013 that compassion means compassion, regardless of whether it\u2019s for two or four-legged beings. I\u2019m often taken aback by the kind heartedness of the people I work with \u2013 the number of rescued dogs who join us in the office is just one indication of that. A couple of months ago, the league supported Organ Donation Week by encouraging staff to join the register (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/voluntary-sector-network/2016/sep/07/organ-donation-week-awareness-campaign\">our HR consultant and I are both living donors</a>) \u2013 now nine in 10 members of staff are signed up.</p> <p>However, I\u2019m also exposed to the dark side. Our work on animal cruelty, such as dog fighting, shows clearly that people who hurt animals are often linked to other crimes, including abuse and violence against other people. If we try to separate compassion into categories \u2013 who or what deserves compassion, and at what time \u2013 we are on a rocky road.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"b407da294da146b452ad5bb7c1e492ceba0a5044\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b407da294da146b452ad5bb7c1e492ceba0a5044/0_70_960_960/500.jpg\" alt=\"Gon\u00e7alves dressed for sleeping out\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gon\u00e7alves dressed for sleeping out</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: League Against Cruel Sports</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p> Of course, bosses sleeping out won\u2019t, on its own, solve homelessness. But by giving leaders a taste of what it\u2019s like, it may give them the much-needed spur to tackle a crisis so many would prefer was swept under the carpet.</p> <p>Right now Britain needs strong moral leadership. I believe that when the voluntary sector is suffering a crisis of confidence, and needs to work to win back public trust, charity leaders need to do more to walk the talk.

  "<p>With the possible exception of <a href=\"http://www.nba.com/article/2016/10/29/new-orleans-pelicans-anthony-davis-back-back-40s\">Anthony Davis</a>, currently putting up monster numbers for the winless New Orleans Pelicans, no player has started the season off better than Oklahoma City Thunder\u2019s Russell Westbrook. Freed from having to share the court with Kevin Durant, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2016/jul/07/kevin-durant-departure-oklahoma-city-nba-basketball\">who bolted to the Golden State Warriors during the offseason</a>, the newly liberated Westbrook has taken full control of his team and the early dividends have been astounding.</p> <p>In the first game of the season, Westbrook was an assist away from logging a a triple double at the expense of Philadelphia\u2019s defense. On Friday, Westbrook <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/29/russell-westbrook-50-point-triple-double-nba\">put up 51 points</a>, 13 rebounds and 10 assists in a 113-110 overtime win over the Phoenix Suns, the first time a player has scored 50 points in a triple double since Kareem Abdul-Jabbar pulled off a similar feat in 1975.</p> <p>Oh, and he won the game by making a layup with just 3.6 seconds left on the clock in overtime.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6T7X-KZ8S_A\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6T7X-KZ8S_A?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Westbrook was somewhat less impressive on Sunday, as he scored a mere 33 points in 33 minutes in a win over the Los Angeles Lakers, although he made up for that by accumulating 12 rebounds and16 assists. Yes, Westbrook only barely missed a chance to start the season with three<a href=\"http://thecomeback.com/nba/yes-russell-westbrook-can-average-a-triple-double-this-season.html\"> straight triple-doubles</a>. In short, he\u2019s been looking exactly like the player who people were predicting to be the MVP this season, despite the continued existence of LeBron James, Steph Curry and Durant.</p> <p>While few expected him to put up numbers quite this impressive, Westbrook\u2019s hot start shouldn\u2019t come as a total surprise. Although nobody could deny that his partnership with Durant was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/dec/16/durant-and-westbrook-the-leagues-most-entertaining-duo\">a successful one</a>, there was always the sense that having to share the ball with a fellow Hall of Fame caliber player was preventing him from reaching his full potential. <br></p> <p>And his performance during these first three games, all Thunder wins, can\u2019t be completely dismissed as a small sample size anomaly, mostly because it corresponds with what Westbrook has done without Durant in the past. Most notably, Westbrook averaged 28.1 points per game during the 2014-15 season, nearly carrying a once-floundering team into the postseason while Durant was sidelined with an injury. Despite just missing the playoffs, Westbrook still came in fourth place during that year\u2019s MVP voting, just behind Curry, LeBron and James Harden.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2016/jul/07/kevin-durant-departure-oklahoma-city-nba-basketball\">Kevin Durant's exit hurts an Oklahoma mourning much more than basketball</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Somehow Westbrook looks even more dangerous this time around. In fact it\u2019s difficult to recall a NBA player having a better start to the season. While Westbrook is a player who doesn\u2019t need much motivation, he has always played the game like a surprisingly graceful wrecking ball, he looks like someone who has something to prove to the entire basketball world. Which he does.</p> <p>Not only is Westbrook attempting to prove that the Thunder are his team now, he\u2019s also competing with Durant now that he\u2019s with the team\u2019s arch-rivals in California. One imagines that he probably wasn\u2019t too unhappy when Durant\u2019s Warriors <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/26/spurs-thrash-warriors-in-nba-opener-as-cavaliers-roar-past-knicks\">got blown out at home</a> by the San Antonio Spurs on opening day.</p> <p>While the 3-0 Thunder have to be thrilled about how Westbrook\u2019s performance so far, they are well-aware that no player, nobody, not even Westbrook, <a href=\"http://www.espn.co.uk/blog/okc-thunder/post/_/id/1900/russell-westbrook-wills-the-thunder-to-a-win-but-can-he-keep-this-up\">is able to sustain</a> this level of play for any long stretch of time. First off, there\u2019s the reality that he would be risking burnout by the time the playoffs come around. Secondly, his current exertions will put a strain on his body, a dicey proposition considering Westbrook\u2019s injury history.</p> <p>There\u2019s also the fact that there will be some nights where Westbrook\u2019s admirable recklessness on the court will backfire. Yes, Westbrook can \u2013 and will \u2013 single-handedly win games, but on occasion he\u2019ll also lose a few on his own as well. When Westbrook\u2019s game is off, his propensity for volume shooting can lead to some thoroughly ugly stat lines and even on his best nights, he often commits unforced turnovers, almost as if the ball can\u2019t quite keep up with him.<br></p> <p>That\u2019s the trade off when you have to rely on a player as unique as Westbrook, whose greatest strength also doubles as his biggest weakness. In the past, Durant has been able to bail out the team when Westbrook has one of those games where he has nearly as many turnovers as made field goals. The Thunder no longer have that security blanket.<br></p> <p>The good news for Oklahoma City is that head coach Billy Donovan is well aware that they can\u2019t count on Good Russell game-in, game-out, and is aware of the need to get more players involved. \u201cHe knows what happened last night is not sustainable,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.normantranscript.com/sports/russell-westbrook-still-adjusting-to-new-environment/article_c79b11e8-9e12-11e6-b81c-6bfa8ea08476.html\">Donovan said</a> after Friday night\u2019s win, emphasizing the Thunder\u2019s need to start playing more as a group and less like Westbrook\u2019s backup band. \u201cIt\u2019s been great working with him because he\u2019s really thinking from a leadership standpoint, \u2018How do I incorporate all these guys? how do I help these guys?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>This brings us the Thunder\u2019s biggest concern: they either need to surround Westbrook with better players or hope for a breakout season from one or more guys already on their roster. At times Westbrook can be an incredibly inefficient shooter, but it\u2019s hard to blame him here. If you were one of the best players in the league, and Victor Oladipo were your team\u2019s second-highest scorer, you just might put up <a href=\"http://www.normantranscript.com/sports/thunderroad/putting-russell-westbrook-s-shots-into-perspective/article_91fa5584-9e2c-11e6-a4f9-e7b2c0a61694.html\">44 shots</a> a game too. Because of this it\u2019s imperative that the Thunder be proactive in adding players who give Westbrook more options, boost their iffy bench and/or allow them to rest Westbrook more often during the regular season to keep him fresh, Gregg Popovich style.<br></p> <p>As fun as it is to watch Westbrook take over games all by himself, barreling through defenses and burying opponents under an avalanche of made baskets, it\u2019s not an effective long-term strategy. Just because the Thunder could depend on Westbrook lifting the entire team on his back, it doesn\u2019t mean that they should.</p>",
  "<p>I know, right? Who doesn\u2019t? We all hate the internet, even as we can no longer imagine life without it, unless we\u2019re one of those people who go ostentatiously offline for a few months and then write a lengthy report about internet-free life that is posted to the internet so we can read it and carry on hating the internet while still actually using it. I mean, you\u2019re probably reading this on the internet. If you\u2019re reading it in print you\u2019ll probably get bored halfway through and check the internet on your phone in case there\u2019s something more interesting to skim. Such is life.</p> <p>This book about hating the internet calls itself a novel, and it is, in a way \u2013 it&#xa0;features (presumably) made-up characters saying (presumably) made- up things \u2013&#xa0;but one of its manifold charms is that it repeatedly insists it is a \u201cbad novel\u201d. This is a good thing, at&#xa0;least in this bad novel\u2019s satirically paranoid scheme, for it argues that the \u201cgood novel\u201d \u2013&#xa0;the American literary novel, \u201cwhich paired pointless sex with ruminations on the nature of mortgages\u201d \u2013 was an invention of the CIA, which funded influential magazines such as the Paris Review. Also, the narrator insists, literary novels of our day simply cannot handle the internet. They don\u2019t know what to do with it. Their attempts to incorporate it&#xa0;are just embarrassing.</p> <p>So, a bad novel, then: one that, it promises, will mimic the internet \u201cin its irrelevant and jagged presentation of content\u201d. Its heroine is 45-year-old Adeline, who is a bit famous because of some comic books she drew in the 1990s. The novel opens with her receiving rape and death threats on Twitter, as pretty much any woman will these days who expresses strong opinions on the internet. It then flicks back and forth between the present day and the 90s, filling in the backstory and introducing an agreeable supporting cast of writers and eccentrics hanging out in New York or San Francisco. There is a lot of smart, cynical chat, but not much in the way of dramatic suspense or well-formed story. Those things, after all, are for good novels.</p> <p>What there is instead is a quite thrillingly funny and vicious anatomy of hi-tech culture and the modern world in general. The book\u2019s governing rhetorical device is to explain everything about the world it is describing, as if to aliens, or to people far in the future after the collapse of our own civilisation. Thus: \u201cWars were giant parties for the ruling elites, who sometimes thought it might be great fun to make the poor kill each other.\u201d Or: \u201cThomas Jefferson was the rare slave holder who enjoyed raping his property while writing declarations and essays and letters about the dignity of man.\u201d Or: \u201cThe Internet was a wonderful invention. It was a computer network which people used to remind other people that they were awful pieces of shit.\u201d (Such descriptions of the internet recur throughout the book, in an appallingly accurate running joke.)</p> <p>Most contemptuously skewered are&#xa0;the Silicon Valley crowd. \u201cLike many of&#xa0;the men who worked with technology in the information economy, Erik Willems had a deep affection for juvenile literature.\u201d (He means works of fantasy, for example those by Tolkien or Ayn Rand.) Actual people are also named and mocked \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/nov/01/steve-jobs-the-afterlife-film-michael-fassbender-danny-boyle-alex-gibney\" title=\"\">Steve Jobs</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2013/mar/15/facebook-sheryl-sandberg-lean-in\" title=\"\">Sheryl Sandberg, author&#xa0;of <em>Lean In</em></a>: she is \u201cthe billionaire who worked for Facebook and thought that&#xa0;the way women who&#xa0;weren\u2019t billionaires could get respect in the workplace was to act more like the men that disrespected them in the workplace\u201d. Most reviled of all is the libertarian ideology of tech\u2019s flagwavers. \u201cThe illusion of the internet was the idea that the opinions of powerless people, freely offered, had some impact on the world. This was, of course, total bullshit\u2026 The only effect of the words of powerless people on the internet was to inflict misery on other powerless people.\u201d</p> <p>Eventually, this novel that is possibly only pretending to be a bad one (occasionally <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/may/16/i-hate-the-internet-jarett-kobek-san-francisco\" title=\"\">Jarett Kobek</a> lets his guard slip and commits some literary beauty) culminates in a chapter explaining why the chapter that used to be in its place was a complete failure in its attempt to tie up all the book\u2019s themes. In a rather virtuosic display of <em>via negativa</em>, the new chapter mentions lots of things that were in the old chapter that we can\u2019t read, \u201cLike a description of Thanksgiving as a holiday in which America celebrated the genocide of its indigenous peoples through the gathering of extended families for a meal during which young people were made to feel awkward by their elders expressing thoughts of casual racism and homophobia\u201d. Or an&#xa0;explanation (quite convincing) of why the 20th-century comics industry is the perfect analogue for the 21st\u2011century media world.</p> <p>Kobek has been compared to the French enfant terrible <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/dec/16/michel-houllebecq-france-submission-soumission-muslim-islam-president\" title=\"\">Michel Houellebecq</a> by none other than Jonathan Lethem, the Brooklyn-based writer of \u201cgood novels\u201d, though this book\u2019s cleverly casual style, apparently eschewing literary artifice, reminded me much more of Kurt Vonnegut.</p> <p>But it\u2019s the enraged comedy of its cultural diagnosis that really drives the&#xa0;reader onwards. There are so many&#xa0;brilliant one-liner definitions that it\u2019s hard not to keep quoting them.&#xa0;(\u201cScience fiction was a dying genre in which writers with no personal understanding of the human experience posited many theoretical futures of the species.\u201d) If Ambrose Bierce woke up today&#xa0;from suspended animation and decided to write a sequel to his <em>Devil\u2019s Dictionary</em> in the form of a sort-of fiction, it would look a bit like this.

  "<p>It was a thrilling, breathless night, full of everything that football at its highest level should be, and when it was all done Manchester City could reflect on the kind of result they have craved since the bags of gold arrived from Abu Dhabi and the story of this club changed forever. They had not only beaten Barcelona but they had done it the hard way, coming from behind, and they have spent so long waiting for a victory of this magnitude it automatically takes its place as their most gratifying in the Champions League to date.</p> <p>Any success against a side featuring Lionel Messi, Neymar and Luis Su\u00e1rez has to be cherished but perhaps the most satisfying part for Pep Guardiola\u2019s team is what it showed about their competitive courage and the shift in mentality compared with City\u2019s previous attempts to overcome perhaps the most beautifully constructed club side there has ever been.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/nov/01/manchester-city-lionel-messi-barcelona-champions-league\">Manchester City manage the impossible and keep Lionel Messi in check | Paul Wilson</a> </p> </aside>  <p>City played with a level of self-belief that has never been witnessed in these assignments. No one could accuse them of being cowed in the presence of the team Guardiola described as \u201cthe best\u201d and there has never been a night when so many of their A-listers have reached the point of maximum expression all at once. Kevin De Bruyne can reflect on an evening when he outshone a four-time Ballon d\u2019Or winner. Ilkay G\u00fcndogan, with two of the goals, had his finest game yet in City\u2019s colours and, finally, after six attempts, this fiercely ambitious club knows what it is like to confront Barcelona and do the tormenting rather than the other way around.</p> <p>True, there were long, difficult periods when Messi, Neymar and Su\u00e1rez bewitched them with their speed, thought and movement. Nicol\u00e1s Otamendi still does not seem to comprehend that the most accomplished centre-halves stay on their feet and Guardiola\u2019s first comment in his post-match press conference was to find fault with the team\u2019s first-half display. Yet City had their own attacking trident in De Bruyne, David Silva and Sergio Ag\u00fcero and, ultimately, those three wore down their opponents. De Bruyne\u2019s free-kick to make it 2-1 was a peach but his through ball in the buildup to G\u00fcndogan\u2019s second goal was another reminder of his exquisite ability. Raheem Sterling added his own menace and, as a test of nerve, Guardiola\u2019s men passed with distinction.</p> <p>More than anything, they did not seem afflicted by the inferiority complex that has shaped previous encounters. They rode their luck at times, most notably when the ball came off Ag\u00fcero\u2019s hand before the final goal. There was a period in the first half when the game threatened to run away from them \u2013 \u201cwe were really in trouble,\u201d Guardiola reflected \u2013 and Messi\u2019s goal, following a stunning breakaway, was not the only time the home side left the suspicion they still lack a certain amount of defensive knowhow.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"601a50b8885749c6bf91471d0f463dad53700499\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/601a50b8885749c6bf91471d0f463dad53700499/139_99_3531_2119/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ilkay Gundogan\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ilkay G\u00fcndogan scores his second and Manchester City\u2019s third goal against Barcelona.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Darren Staples/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Yet City deserve immense acclaim for refusing to buckle and they can also look back to the moment, 11 minutes in, when the Hungarian referee, Viktor Kassai, made the kind of mistake that felt incongruous for a night of football royalty. Kassai was badly mistaken to think Sterling had tried to deceive him into awarding a penalty and City would have gone away with legitimate grievances if they had lost the game from that point.</p> <p>Television replays confirmed Samuel Umtiti had clamped his left foot on Sterling. It was a clear penalty and for a while the soundtrack to the night was of raucous disgruntlement. Too much was happening, however, for the crowd to linger on the injustice and, if nothing else, that incident might also have encouraged the home side to think Barcelona were vulnerable at the back.</p> <p>Guardiola had talked beforehand about Bar\u00e7a\u2019s habit of \u201cprovoking mistakes\u201d from their opponents but now it was happening the other way around, too.</p> <p>\u201cIn the first 38 minutes we saw the best team in the world,\u201d Guardiola said of his former club. But everything changed with the calamitous pass that Sergi Roberto subsequently aimed across his own half. Ag\u00fcero was first to the loose ball, turning it to the right for Sterling to drive into the penalty area. Sterling decided against shooting and his pass across the six-yard area was weighted perfectly for G\u00fcndogan to turn in the equaliser.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/nov/02/sergio-aguero-manchester-city-barcelona-champions-league\">Selfless Sergio Ag\u00fcero lights spark that fires Manchester City to victory | Andy Hunter</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Suddenly the home side looked reinvigorated, with De Bruyne becoming increasingly influential after the interval. The Belgian\u2019s free-kick was the outstanding moment of the night, aimed expertly into the top corner of Marc-Andr\u00e9 ter Stegen\u2019s goal, and he was superb during those exhilarating passages when City attacked from every angle and there was the rare sight of a Bar\u00e7a team looking rattled in the extreme.</p> <p>There were still plenty of occasions when City\u2019s opponents showed, in flashes, their attacking brilliance and an almighty scare for the home team when John Stones and Otamendi both reminded us of their occasional frailties only for Andr\u00e9 Gomes, teed up by Su\u00e1rez, to thud his shot against the crossbar. That, however, came at a point of the game when City were creating chance after chance. Ag\u00fcero was fortunate not to be penalised for the handball that left G\u00fcndogan with a simple finish for his second goal but it was also true that Bar\u00e7a suffered during the second half in a way that is seldom seen. That alone made it feel like a special occasion.</p> <p>The downside for City was Fernandinho\u2019s injury and they will have to learn they cannot defend as recklessly as they did for Messi\u2019s goal, stemming from an attack of their own that left seven of Guardiola\u2019s players, including three-quarters of their defence, stranded at the other end of the pitch. Overall, however, there was the sense that City had reached new heights. They looked like a team with nothing to be afraid of.</p>",
  "<p>What would you do if you were told you were going to lose your eyesight in three months? It happened to Steph Cutler, who was a successful fashion designer working for brands such Ted Baker and Marks &amp; Spencer when, in her late 20s, she was told she would lose most of her vision within three months. </p> <p>As Cutler\u2019s sight started to deteriorate as a result of the rare condition Leber\u2019s hereditary optic neuropathy, a friend took her on the London Eye for a last look at the cityscape. Cutler also threw an \u201cI\u2019m going blind\u201d party as a way of \u201cgetting it out there\u201d and telling all her friends at once. She then travelled for three months, visiting the US, South America and New Zealand, to see the world while she still could.<br></p> <p>The lowest point was on her return, when her sight loss got worse and she found herself without a job \u2013 fashion design relies so much on the visual it was no longer viable - living back with her parents and struggling even to get a job interview, let alone a new job. </p> <p>Blasting out U2\u2019s Beautiful Day each morning to get herself out of bed, Cutler set two goals: \u201cIn the short term, to become employable again and in the longer term, to get my independence back. Working to achieve those goals has been the hardest thing I have ever done.\u201d <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"c8cc8191e18d5f0600742ccb190776fa3797af91\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c8cc8191e18d5f0600742ccb190776fa3797af91/0_2_382_478/382.jpg\" alt=\"Steph Cutler launched disability consultancy, Making Lemonade.\" width=\"382\" height=\"478\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Steph Cutler launched disability consultancy, Making Lemonade.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The first step was to learn to use computers, phones and read printed information with assistive technology. Then, using her own experience of feeling unemployable as a result of acquiring a disability, Cutler spotted a gap in the market. There was a need, she felt, for disability and equality training on raising awareness of making recruitment and services open to disabled people. </p> <p>Few people were doing this at the time, but it was still a difficult business model to build. Although organisations knew they should be doing more, they often didn\u2019t prioritise it or want to pay for it, Cutler said.</p> <p>And so, with the help of a government business startup scheme and funding, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://making-lemonade.co.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Making Lemonade</a> was born. The name came from a mantra Cutler adopted while adapting to living with sight loss: \u201cIf life deals you lemons \u2026 get out there and make lemonade.\u201d The yellow and green lemonade branding and theme runs across all marketing material, blogposts and even a recipe to \u201dmake successful lemonade\u201d, a free personal development guide offered on her website.</p> <p>\u201cThe main challenges when I started out were that nobody knew me and I also had a steep learning curve to get up to speed about other disabilities, history and equality law. I did a lot of networking, going along to events and talking and listening to people to find out what they actually needed. This could feel like a thankless task, as there was rarely any instant business, but meeting face to face could result in proposals even three years later,\u201d says Cutler. </p> <p>She is now a trustee for charity Action for Blind People, a fellow of the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.cloresocialleadership.org.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Clore Social Leadership</a> programme, represents disabled people on various national committees and has been recognised in high profile business awards including national finalist in Enterprising Young Brit 2006 and Disabled Entrepreneur of the Year in 2008.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Customer feedback led Cutler to train in new areas and add new strands to Making Lemonade, including motivational speaking, coaching and self-employment workshops. \u201cPeople kept asking me to speak about my story at events but I turned them down as I didn\u2019t \u2018do\u2019 public speaking. Eventually I realised there was no basis, apart from fear, for this. So I joined the Professional Speaking Association and worked at improving my skills, then started accepting invitations to speak. For once, being blind was an advantage \u2013 it\u2019s a lot easier to stand up and speak to an audience when you can\u2019t see them,\u201d she says. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Having an interesting personal story to tell can provide a big advantage for small businesses, Cutler says. \u201cMany SMEs are about the person behind them and if you\u2019re comfortable telling your story, it can help you to stand out from the crowd and inspire others too. This can be great for all sorts of marketing including social media, your website, blogposts and pieces in the media.\u201d<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Now in her eleventh year of trading, Cutler is proud of what she has achieved. \u201cI\u2019ve worked with some amazing clients in the public, private and charity sector and have made a difference along the way,\u201d she says. </p> <p>Plans for developing her business include providing more coaching for \u201cnon-disabled\u201d people and expanding her use of the \u201cdesign thinking\u201d approach in her consultancy work. This is a creative and hands-on approach to solving problems and developing strategies, adopted by companies such as Apple, Google and Samsung, based on the way that designers work. </p> <p>Now Cutler has marked 10 years since losing her sight, by writing an ebook of memoirs and thoughts, Living with More Vision and Less Sight. She says the biggest lesson she has learned along the way is that whatever life deals you, it\u2019s your choice how to view those circumstances. She recounts a family game over Sunday lunch which involved created six-word memoirs.

  "<p>The federal building code attached to the Australian Building and Construction Commission bill would decrease apprentices on building projects and increase workers on 457 temporary skilled

</p> </aside>  <p>The McKell report notes the code bans common clauses including those that: ensure subcontractors and their workers are paid the same as other employees on site, limit the number of ordinary hours worked per day, guarantee rostered days off including public holidays, discourage discrimination against mature workers, and set stable rosters.</p> <p>The report noted that at the end of 2015 there were 278,600 apprentices and trainees in training, 11.8% fewer than at the end of 2014.</p> <p>It said \u201cthe only instrument that guarantees the number of apprentices to a workforce can be found in suitable enterprise agreements that mandate safety and apprenticeship ratios\u201d, a practice the code would ban.</p> <p>The report argues that since the cost of training apprentices outweighs their output for the first two years, the building code will encourage employers to source skilled labour from overseas instead.</p> <p>Companies that choose to train Australian workers \u201care at a competitive disadvantage compared to those who avail themselves of the 457 [skilled temporary work visa] worker\u201d, it said.</p> <p>The code would apply to enterprise agreements struck after 24 April 2014, which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/oct/26/michaelia-cash-criticised-over-industrial-relations-bill-with-retrospective-powers\">gives it retrospective effect because it bars builders</a> from government work based on deals struck before the code was in place.</p> <p>The McKell report said that, in order to comply with the code, some building companies would need to renegotiate their workplace deals which \u201ccould lead to further and significant industrial disputation\u201d.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/mar/22/does-malcolm-turnbulls-claim-the-abcc-will-increase-productivity-stack-up\">Decreasing industrial action</a> is one of the

of the building and construction sector still outpaces most other sectors and the industry is still healthy and growing\u201d.</p> <p>It said since the ABCC was abolished in 2008 labour productivity in the construction sector has grown annually by an average of 4.81% and in the heavy and civil engineering sector it grew by 6.38%. </p> <p>\u201cThis compares to the average for all industries of

site except where they were exercising statutory rights to check work health and safety complaints.</p> <p>The report said the code would \u201cdisproportionately affect women, older workers and unions\u201d because it banned any form of affirmative action for certain categories of workers and banned union presence at staff inductions and safety talks.</p> <p>Employment law expert and Adelaide law school professor Andrew Stewart has told Guardian Australia the code <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/oct/26/michaelia-cash-criticised-over-industrial-relations-bill-with-retrospective-powers\">is a source of significant concern in the construction industry</a>.</p> <p>\u201cVirtually every major builder will be non-compliant,\u201d he said, in reference to the broad range of deal content barred by the code and its retrospective effect.<br></p> <p>He said the code could be changed to only bar agreements struck after it passed, in which case it would have \u201cminimal practical effect\u201d, or it would apply retrospectively and \u201cforce building companies to renegotiate their enterprise agreements simultaneously causing industrial mayhem\u201d.</p> <p>Stewart said the code barred \u201cany clauses with any impact on productivity, or the right of companies to manage their business\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIt essentially gives [Fair Work Building and Construction director] Nigel Hadgkiss or whoever is the director of the ABCC discretion to object to any union agreement on a very wide number of bases.\u201d</p> <p>The McKell report noted that the code was silent on whether builders with poor safety records, a history of bankruptcies and \u201cphoenixing\u201d activity should be excluded from government work.</p> <p>Although the code is currently attached to the ABCC bill, the McKell report suggests that,

He\u2019s grabbing a late Sunday breakfast, and he smiles thoughtfully as he considers his reply. \u201cThe film does have that quality of being a monument, but I think you change something straight away when you take it from screen to stage. And, even though I\u2019ve followed the film quite closely, I\u2019ve been able to see lots of ways of expanding on it through dance. There will be quite a few surprises along the way.\u201d<br></p> <p>One area where Bourne has let his imagination run riot is in choreographing the life of the ballet company Page belongs to. In the film, the company is run by Boris Lermontov, a steely aesthete and ruthless boss who has shades of the great Russian impresario <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2010/sep/12/sergei-diaghilev-and-the-ballets-russes\">Sergei Diaghilev</a>. But while Bourne has retained the character of Lermontov, he\u2019s given the company a new identity, one that bears a distinct resemblance to the Royal Ballet back in 1948, when it was still known as Sadler\u2019s Wells Ballet. The company had just emerged from the war years, when it went slogging around Britain entertaining the public and the troops. For Bourne, it seemed to have something of the improvised, mongrel quality of his own troupe, <a href=\"http://new-adventures.net/\">New Adventures</a>. </p> <p>\u201cIt was a company I felt we could relate to, even though we\u2019re not a ballet company ourselves. When we were building up the background and the characters in the story, I had my dancers research the lives of English dancers like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beryl_Grey\">Beryl Grey</a>. Vicky, of course, is a little bit <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/margot-fonteyn\">Margot Fonteyn</a> and, although the audience doesn\u2019t have to know about those connections, they make the work a bit richer.\u201d<br></p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I have to be careful what I say \u2013 or tweet \u2026  It\u2019s like I\u2019ve become an authority, the voice of dance</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Bourne has also aimed for historical authenticity in the works he\u2019s created for Page and the Lermontov company, referencing the kind of mid-20th century repertory that Sadler\u2019s Wells Ballet would have danced. There\u2019s a pastiche of Frederick Ashton\u2019s Dante Sonata, as well as \u201ca beach ballet and a more waltzy old-fashioned kind of ballet\u201d. Bourne relished the stylistic challenges of creating this work, including the fact that some of it has to be danced on pointes. </p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve always resisted that, but I realised I had to have it here.\u201d He particularly had to have pointe shoes in the Red Shoes, the ballet that turns Page into a star but also precipitates her tragedy. As in the film, it\u2019s based on the strange and sinister fairytale by Hans Christian Andersen, but Bourne says he had \u201ca lot of fun\u201d inventing a brand new choreographic language for it. \u201cI wanted this ballet to look as if it was something a little bit futuristic for those times. The whole set changes, we go into a different world.\u201d</p> <p>But the most satisfying challenge has been portraying the intense triangular relationship between Lermontov, Page and Julian Craster, the composer Page falls in love with. \u201cThe more I\u2019ve watched the film, the more I\u2019ve realised how messy that relationship is. Vicky and Julian fall in love while they\u2019re working together on the Red Shoes ballet and, really, they\u2019re only happy together inside that burst of creativity. Afterwards, it doesn\u2019t work so well and I\u2019ve actually found myself sympathising with Lermontov\u2019s position: that love and art don\u2019t always go together.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bd37c66fff4c6df7c795b7b5df51a4b79d28de68\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bd37c66fff4c6df7c795b7b5df51a4b79d28de68/307_1464_4292_2576/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Love and art don\u2019t always go together\u2019 \u2026 Matthew Bourne.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Love and art don\u2019t always go together\u2019 \u2026 Matthew Bourne.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Saker/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Bourne also recognised that there were layers to Page\u2019s individual character that needed to be explored. \u201cShe\u2019s actually quite calculating and forthright \u2013 much tougher than the Natalie Portman character in Black Swan. I\u2019ve tried to show that side of her. There are two small scenes in the film between her and Julian that I\u2019ve expanded into longer duets. It\u2019s been quite new for me to get to grips with all that complexity, all those different motivations.\u201d</p> <p>If Bourne regards this production as a significant new phase in his dance-making, he says he\u2019s been inspired by his music, which he thinks will be one of the \u201cbiggest revelations of the show\u201d. The film\u2019s original score was not adequate to his needs, so he and his regular collaborator <a href=\"http://new-adventures.net/company/meet-our-team/terry-davies\">Terry Davies</a> investigated the works of <a href=\"http://www.bernardherrmann.org/articles/blog-herrmann100/\">Bernard Herrmann</a>. \u201cThere is so much of his music that hasn\u2019t been used in the theatre, concert pieces and film scores. It has a bittersweet quality, full of feeling. We\u2019ve used some of the music from Citizen Kane, would you believe, and Fahrenheit 451. Terry has arranged it into a full-length score. I\u2019m very excited about it.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"cf2f4e83cc1652f37f264956a8daa9ef887c7ec6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cf2f4e83cc1652f37f264956a8daa9ef887c7ec6/267_1116_2281_2851/800.jpg\" alt=\"Ashley Shaw as Vicky Page in Matthew Bourne\u2019s The Red Shoes.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ashley Shaw as Vicky Page in Matthew Bourne\u2019s The Red Shoes.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hugo Glendinning</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The work of Bourne\u2019s other long-term collaborator, the designer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2012/oct/14/lez-brotherston-matthew-bourne \">Lez Brotherston</a>, has been equally important: creating sets that shift the location from London to Monte Carlo to the fantasy land of the Red Shoes, producing a vast wardrobe of costumes for the 24 dancers. \u201cIt\u2019s crazy, we\u2019ve got more costumes for this show than any other. Lez is brilliant but we\u2019ve had to work hard to keep him inside the budget.\u201d</p> <p>Calculating the cost of a production like The Red Shoes, as well as creating its story and choreography, is a massive undertaking and Bourne does sometimes wonder if he can bear to put himself through it all. \u201cYou\u2019re always fighting with yourself, worried about repeating yourself, wondering if you can get away with a trick that you\u2019ve used before.\u201d At 56, he has an impressive body of work \u2013 not only for New Adventures but also in musical theatre \u2013 but he feels suddenly aware of being one of the oldest choreographers working in Britain. </p> <p>He gives a rueful grin when he admits that being awarded a knighthood this year has made him feel his age. \u201cI\u2019m just beginning to get used to it but it seems to have brought a lot of responsibility. I find I have to be careful what I say \u2013 or tweet \u2013 because people are much more likely to report on it. It\u2019s like I\u2019ve become an authority, the voice of dance.\u201d<br></p> <p>But these worries seem to fade away when he launches into a list of his future plans. He wants to mount a brand new Swan Lake (\u201csome of it will look very different\u201d) and he\u2019s in discussions with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/sadlers-wells\">Sadler\u2019s Wells</a> for a small experimental work to be shown in its new 500-seat theatre. Despite feeling the strain of creating The Red Shoes, Bourne acknowledges that these large-scale productions are where his heart lies. \u201cNew Adventures has grown so much over the last 20 years, but it still feels like family to me. It still has that freshness of spirit. And the truth is I like making big shows for big audiences.

  "<p>Natural ways of stopping floods, such as tree planting and putting logs in rivers to slow water flow must be a key part of protecting the nation as climate change intensifies rain storms, according to a <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/environment-food-and-rural-affairs-committee/inquiries/parliament-2015/inquiry/\">report from MPs</a>.</p> <p>The cross-party committee criticised the government for its limited plans and insufficient funding, and called for the Environment Agency to be stripped of its responsibility for flooding and replaced by a dedicated floods authority and a national flood commissioner, as is the case in the Netherlands. </p> <p>Other measures proposed include paying farmers to store water in fields and forcing housebuilders to make new homes resilient to flooding.</p> <p>More than 5 million people in England are at risk of flooding and recent winters have seen devastating deluges, with storm Desmond alone causing \u00a35bn in damages in the northern UK. The coalition government <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/dec/28/flood-defences-row-uk-paying-price-david-cameron-tories-broken-promises\">cut flood defence spending sharply</a>, and increases in finds only followed the recent floods.</p> <p>The government\u2019s National Flood Resilience Review (NFRR), published in September, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/08/flooding-uk-government-plans-for-more-extreme-rainfall\">increased the projections for extreme rainfall</a> and moved to protect critical infrastructure, but it was criticised for lacking a long-term strategy and ignoring flash flooding, which alone threatens 3m homes.</p> <p>\u201cWe propose a radical alternative to the NFFR\u2019s limited solutions to the current fragmented, inefficient and ineffective flood risk management arrangements,\u201d said Neil Parish, the Conservative MP who chairs the environment, food and rural affairs (Efra) select committee. </p> <p>\u201cOur proposals will deliver a far more holistic approach to flooding and water supply management, looking at catchments as a whole.\u201d</p> <p>The dominant approach to previous flood management was to get the water from hills to the sea as quickly as possible, via drainage and straightened rivers. But this means the flows in rivers can peak dramatically, threatening villages, towns and cities. Poor farming practices, the loss of woods and urban development have all further accelerated the runoff of water. \u201cThe likelihood of flooding is now at an all-time high and will continue to increase,\u201d the MPs said.</p> <p>Pilot <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/apr/13/500000-tree-planting-project-helped-yorkshire-town-miss-winter-floods\">schemes at Pickering</a> in Yorkshire, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/jan/10/flood-defence-nature-experiments\">Holnicote in Somerset</a> and <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/mar/11/planting-more-trees-can-reduce-uk-flooding-research-shows\">elsewhere</a> have shown that flood risk can be lowered by slowing the flow of water off the land by planting trees, managing soils better, putting logs in streams to form leaky dams and by using fields to temporarily store water. A large-scale trial across a whole catchment is urgently needed, the MPs said.</p> <p>\u201cIf you can hold back the water, even for 12 hours, you can hold back the peak,\u201d said Parish. He opposed Brexit, but said it would give the opportunity to implement new subsidies for farmers who help prevent floods.</p> <p>The Environment Agency\u2019s responsibilities include national flood risk management and defence-building, as well as pollution and waste control. Parish said it has done a good job on the large-scale issues but was seen as too remote by communities affected by flooding. An overhaul of all the various local, regional and national bodies involved would streamline roles and pool expertise, he said.</p> <p>The committee said it was impossible to prevent all future floods and so the resilience of people\u2019s homes and businesses had to be improved, such as by protecting doorways and placing electrical sockets at higher levels. </p> <p>\u201cThe trouble with developers is they don\u2019t want to put these resilience measures into a house because as soon as anyone walks in, they say \u2018oh, is this area prone to flooding\u2019?\u201d said Parish. The MPs said new building regulations should be imposed if the industry failed to agree a voluntary code by the end of 2016.</p> <p>The committee also said insurance companies should do much better in incentivising people who have been flooded to improve the protection of their homes during the repairs, rather than just replace what was damaged. </p> <p>Daniel Johns, head of adaptation at the government\u2019s official advisers, the Committee on Climate Change, welcomed the report: \u201cClimate change is likely to increase the risk of flooding for many communities in England [but] there is no long-term strategy in place from the government to address it. Like the Efra committee, we\u2019ve also called repeatedly for the government to take further steps to ensure new development isn\u2019t adding to the long-term problem.\u201d </p> <p>The landowners\u2019 association, the CLA, welcomed the suggestion that a post-Brexit farm subsidy regime could include payments for flood prevention, but said it would be a \u201cbackward step\u201d to remove flood responsibilities from the Environment Agency. </p> <p>\u201cIt would risk a confused and disjointed approach at a time when people and businesses affected by flooding desperately need more investment,\u201d said Ross Murray, CLA president.</p> <p>Guy Shrubsole, a campaigner at Friends of the Earth, also criticised the idea: \u201cIt would waste vital expertise and could cause more delays in planning better ways to avoid flooding. But the government should heed the MPs\u2019 welcome proposals to tackle flooding at root \u2013 working with nature across entire river catchments and dealing with climate change.\u201d</p> <p>A spokesman for the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: \u201cWe take a long-term, strategic approach to protecting the nation from floods. We are spending \u00a32.5bn on building flood defence schemes across the country to better protect an additional 300,000 homes by 2021. </p> <p>\u201cWe are already implementing many of the suggestions this report makes, such as managing watercourses across entire catchment areas, but see no need for structural changes.\u201d</p>",

  "<h2><strong>The Missing </strong><br>9pm, BBC1</h2> <p>A drama as befuddling as Harry and Jack Williams\u2019s story of a kidnapped girl returned to her parents needs to be anchored by performances of quiet, still strength. It\u2019s got them, with Keeley Hawes superb again tonight as a mother shattered by grief and confusion. Even in an episode that exists in the sad aftermath of last week\u2019s explosive ending, the twin timelines and mass of concealed info still make us feel like we\u2019re spinning helplessly in the dark. <em>Jack Seale</em></p> <h2><strong>Unarmed Black Man </strong><br>9pm, BBC2</h2> <p>William Chapman, a teenager from Virginia, was one of 306 black men killed by US police in 2015. Unusually, Chapman\u2019s death resulted not merely in the dismissal from the force of the (white) officer involved, Stephen Rankin, but in murder charges. James Jones\u2019s fascinating film sees Rankin\u2019s trial from both sides and attempts to do the same for the issue it highlights, an effort wretchedly unlikely to become redundant any time soon. <em>Andrew Mueller</em></p> <h2><strong>Television\u2019s Opening Night: How the Box Was Born </strong><br>9pm, BBC4</h2> <p>On 2 November 1936, the BBC first broadcast to the nation. The medium was more significant than the message: the content was a brief variety show and, in any case, hardly anyone had a TV at this point. This cheerful film sees a team led by Dallas Campbell and Professor Danielle George attempting to reconstruct that broadcast using approximations of the original equipment. Hardly an essential mission but it\u2019s fun to see boffins at play and eventually, oddly touching to see this quixotic enterprise reach fruition. <em>Phil Harrison</em></p> <h2><strong>My Trans American Road Trip </strong><br>10pm, Channel 4</h2> <p>Abigail Austen made headlines in 2007 as the first British army officer to transition from male from female, but she\u2019s now more frequently found on the other side of the fence as a reporter for C4\u2019s Unreported World. In this important documentary, she investigates why trans rights have been a major talking point in the run-up to the US election, looking at everything from conditions in the military to laws around public bathrooms. <em>Hannah J Davies</em></p> <h2><br>This Time Next Year<br>8pm, ITV</h2> <p>In this concept-heavy new show, Davina McCall cocks her head to the side and listens while members of the public confide in her a deeply personal goal, be it losing weight, conceiving a child or finding love. Having filmed their interview a year ago, a \u201ctime-travel\u201d format shows them appearing through a Stars in Their Eyes-type door moments later having done what they set out to do, to the delight of a studio audience. From the Cilla/Rantzen school of touchy-feely telly. <em>Ben Arnold</em></p> <h2>Dropperz <br>8.30pm, ITV2</h2> <p>Hapless grime collective Dropperz aren\u2019t exactly at the top of their game as they struggle to get it together this one-off comedy mockumentary pilot. It\u2019s their last chance to film their video and find the fame they deserve, but with a dead rabbit and a guilty dog on their hands, it looks like they\u2019re about to be dropped from their record label. Promising fun with a talented and witty cast including Kiell Smith-Bynoe, Guz Khan, Letitia Hector and Alexis Caley. <em>Hannah Verdier</em></p> <h2>Conviction <br>9pm, Sky Living</h2> <p>New series in which Hayley Atwell plays a rebellious former First Daughter, presented with a choice: work for a new legal outfit aiming to exonerate the wrongly convicted, or go to prison for cocaine offences.

After all, a handful of people in the audience had been alive on 25 July 1946, when these murders were committed. Some of them had been living just a few miles away from where we were now standing in the pouring rain, feeling the heavy presence of a violent history, and bracing for the brutal end.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>In the century after the end of the American civil war, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/feb/10/history-of-lynchings-and-racial-violence-continues-to-haunt-us\">lynching became a fixture of life</a> in the United States, especially in the south. Though often remembered as acts of vigilante justice carried out by extremists, these acts of terror were widely tolerated by state and federal officials \u2013 and often attended by large crowds that included prominent local citizens and their elected representatives, all eager to see newly liberated black southerners reminded that white people could kill them with impunity.</p> <p>The exact number of murders will never be tallied, but the most comprehensive recent study has identified at least 4,075 killings between 1877 and 1950. There has been no prominent public memorial or monument to the thousands of black lives taken by white terrorism in America. Plans to build <a href=\"http://eji.org/news/eji-announces-plans-to-build-museum-and-national-lynching-memorial\">the first such memorial</a>, in Montgomery, Alabama, were announced only a few months ago.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/feb/10/history-of-lynchings-and-racial-violence-continues-to-haunt-us\">Jim Crow lynchings more widespread than first thought, report concludes</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But for the last 12 years, there has been one unique and extraordinary effort to commemorate a single lynching: the infamous 1946 killing of two black men and their wives in Monroe \u2013 a crime that would shock the nation and help spark major changes in the law, even as its perpetrators went unidentified and unpunished.</p> <p>On 14 July 1946, a 24-year-old black farm worker named Roger Malcolm drove a knife into the stomach of his boss and landlord, a prominent white farm owner named Barnette Hester. Malcolm and Hester had both grown up in Monroe, a major cotton-farming town in Walton County, 40 miles east of Atlanta. As children, they had even played together on the Hester family farm. But now they were separated by a vast gulf: Hester was white and owned land, from which he profited handsomely; Malcolm was black and worked the land, from which he eked out a living. Like many black citizens of Georgia, Malcolm was determined to leave soon and head north to Chicago in search of better employment and social mobility.</p> <p>Malcolm, a notoriously short-tempered man, had come to believe that his common-law wife, Dorothy, was having sex with Hester. Drunk and furious, Malcolm confronted Hester in front of his house. In the scuffle that ensued, Malcolm took out a knife and stabbed him. The fight was witnessed by several other members of the Hester family, who were inclined to kill Malcolm on the spot. But they demurred. \u201cYou would have to serve time,\u201d counselled Ida Hester, Barnette\u2019s mother, according to one account. \u201cYou let the others do it.\u201d</p> <p>Hester was sent to a local hospital. Malcolm was locked in the local jail. Eleven days later, when it was clear that Hester would survive his wounds, a white cotton farmer named Loy Harrison came downtown to secure Malcolm\u2019s release, notionally bailing him out in exchange for future labour. Such arrangements were widespread in the south. In Monroe, especially during the cotton harvest, it was common for local sheriffs and police to spend Saturdays making sure the jail was stocked with cheap workers for the week to come.</p> <p>Dorothy Malcolm had a brother, George Dorsey, a veteran of the second world war who lived and worked on Harrison\u2019s farm with his wife, Mae Murray Dorsey. Together, Dorothy, George and Mae Murray had lobbied Harrison to post Malcolm\u2019s bail. He would be safer, they thought, as a source of white profit than as a black man sitting in a poorly guarded jail in the centre of town. Dorothy, George, and Mae accompanied Harrison on the journey to pick up Malcolm.</p> <p>Shortly after he had collected Malcolm from jail and driven out of downtown Monroe with both Malcolms and both Dorseys in his car, Harrison came to a stop just before the wooden slat bridge that crossed the Apalachee River. Up ahead, there was a group of white men blocking the road. They had guns. A few minutes later, the Malcolms and Dorseys were dead, each of their bodies shot multiple times with pistols and shotguns at point-blank range. Either before or after the shooting started, someone tied a noose around Roger\u2019s neck, but he was not hanged.</p> <p>The lynching of black citizens had been common ever since the emancipation of slaves, and the failure of the post-war Reconstruction programme designed to enforce racial equality in the former Confederacy. But the nature of these murders had evolved over the years.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"3d00a86bea9af415384953adfcf2d5f94e5efb7a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3d00a86bea9af415384953adfcf2d5f94e5efb7a/9_0_1725_1725/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Loy Harrison (right), Coroner WT Brown (center) and Sheriff JM Bond (left) at Moore\u2019s Ford Bridge in Georgia on 26 July 1946, a day four black people were killed there by a lynch mob.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Loy Harrison (right), Coroner WT Brown (center) and Sheriff JM Bond (left) at Moore\u2019s Ford Bridge in Georgia on 26 July 1946, a day four black people were killed there by a lynch mob.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: RF/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The 1880s and 90s were characterised by \u201cspectacle lynchings\u201d, as historians came to call them: public events at which white people gathered by the hundreds to watch victims, typically black men, get tortured, set on fire, hanged, castrated and/or dismembered on their way to death. (Often, spectators would get caught up in the frenzy of the moment and join in the violence.) In the early 20th century, as activists and journalists drew attention to the persistence of racist mob justice across the south, national outrage grew. But lynchings did not stop: they decreased in number, and they went underground. Now the murders were carried out quickly and quietly by small groups on lonely back roads, where no one could see. The style was different, but since lynchings were never prosecuted, the message was the same: <em>watch what we can do</em>.</p> <p>The men who lynched the Malcolms and Dorseys in 1946 did not advertise ahead of time in local newspapers, as their predecessors did, or encourage their neighbours to attend with families and picnic baskets in tow. No one cheered or took pictures while it happened. No photographs appeared on the front page of newspapers the following day. Like so many others, they were confident that the protective shield of the white power structure would keep them safe so long as they weren\u2019t too ostentatious.</p> <p>This confidence was more than warranted. Local police did not even launch an investigation into the murder of the Malcolms and Dorseys. On all four death certificates, the coroner wrote the bureaucratic phrase that, for years, had been listed as the cause of death for victims of lynchings across the country: \u201cAt the hands of persons unknown\u201d.</p> <p>FBI agents came to Monroe two days after the murders, looking to see whether a federal prosecution might be possible. But they quickly realised that none of the white residents of Walton County wanted to help them \u2013 some because they were too scared, others because they were helping with the cover-up. Lamar Howard, a black 19-year-old who had witnessed a conversation between the plotters at the ice house where he worked, was brave enough to come forward and testify. In return, two white men beat him to within an inch of his life.</p> <p>From the perspective of the killers, the lynching could hardly have been more successful. News of the deed spread almost instantly through the entire county by word of mouth, searing the threat of extrajudicial violence into the consciousness of all who heard about it.</p> <p>At the same time, its specific details \u2013 who, exactly, played what role; who tied the noose; who pulled the triggers; who lied to protect the guilty \u2013 were already slipping through the fingers of anyone who tried to grasp them. The killers must have been confident that, as time passed, the story would only grow fainter, and the facts of the crime would be forgotten. Only the fear would remain.</p> <h2>* * * </h2> <p>But then something unexpected happened. Two days after the lynching, news of the killings reached Walter F White, the head of the <a href=\"http://www.naacp.org/\">National Association for the Advancement of Colored People</a>, who had spent decades investigating lynchings across the country firsthand. White was black, but could pass as white \u2013 something he had used to his advantage over the years while interviewing proud lynchers about their exploits. A canny publicist, he felt that the Monroe lynchers\u2019 decision to kill Dorothy and Mae Murray along with their husbands might mobilise public disgust. (Women were lynched relatively rarely.)</p> <p>White sent graphic briefings on the case to news outlets across the country. Reporters started flocking to Monroe, bringing America news that lynching \u2013 which many white people thought of as a relic of the past \u2013 was alive and well.</p> <p>In cities across the country, people took to the streets in protest. In Atlanta, a teenage Martin Luther King Jr was inspired to write <a href=\"http://kingencyclopedia.stanford.edu/encyclopedia/documentsentry/doc_460806_000/\">a letter to the editor of the Atlanta Journal Constitution</a>. (In his letter, King refutes the commonplace argument that lynchings were an attempt to protect white women from the sexual aggression of black men: \u201cIt is fair to remember that almost the total of race mixture in America has come, not at Negro initiative, but by the acts of those very white men who talk loudest of race purity.\u201d) The Justice Department was flooded with mail expressing shock and frustration that such a crime could go unpunished in 1940s America. At the White House, a deluge of outraged telegrams demanded that President Harry Truman take action.</p> <p>Truman had never displayed much concern for racial justice. But like many other observers of the Monroe lynching, he was particularly disturbed that one of the victims, George Dorsey, had spent more than two years of the second world war fighting for the US in the South Pacific \u2013 risking his life for his country, only to be gunned down by white supremacists at home. In September, Truman invited White to Washington to give a talk on the state of racial violence nationwide, including the case in Monroe. When the presentation was over, the president\u2019s face was pale. \u201cMy God,\u201d he said. \u201cI had no idea it was as terrible as that.\u201d Three months later, he created <a href=\"https://www.trumanlibrary.org/hstpaper/pccr.htm\">the President\u2019s Committee on Civil Rights</a>, which played a key role in ending the racial segregation of the federal workforce and the US military.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"1f6280b60886e81b1c502d631629bbc8d67149f9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1f6280b60886e81b1c502d631629bbc8d67149f9/0_15_8431_5059/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The grave site of George and Dorothy Dorsey, who were killed in the Moore\u2019s Ford Bridge lynching\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The grave site of George and Dorothy Dorsey, who were killed in the Moore\u2019s Ford Bridge lynching.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ben Rollins/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But back in Monroe, the murders stayed in the shadows. \u201cIf anyone would be fool enough to talk about the lynching, they would also be killed,\u201d one white man told the FBI. Others proudly declared that, even if they did know something, they wouldn\u2019t say so. A grand jury of white citizens, many from Walton County, failed to approve charges against a single suspect. Decades passed. The suspects began to age and die. For as long as he lived, Loy Harrison \u2013 the farmer who had secured Roger Malcolm\u2019s release from jail \u2013 insisted, increasingly implausibly, that he had not been part of the lynching plot, and that he had not recognised any of the killers. \u201cWhy, I\u2019m as mad as anybody, the way they killed my niggers,\u201d he told the FBI during their original investigation. \u201cI need all the nigger hands I can get.\u201d</p> <p>The FBI investigation closed. The reporters went home. In Walton County, people \u2013 white and black \u2013 talked about the lynching behind closed doors or not at all, and those who remembered that it had happened started to die and move away. Some told their children the story, but many preferred to avoid the subject. (Roger Malcolm\u2019s own son from an earlier marriage, who was spirited out of town on the night of the murders, only learned the full story of his father\u2019s killing decades later.)</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/feb/26/truth-and-reconciliation-is-coming-to-america\">Truth and reconciliation is coming to America from the grassroots | Fania E Davis</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Then, after 45 years of silence, a witness came forward. In 1991, a 55-year-old white man named Clinton Adams walked into the FBI field office in Panama City, Florida. When he was 10, he said, he had witnessed the lynching by the Apalachee River from a nearby field. He had seen some of the lynchers\u2019 faces, he said, and knew who they were. Adams claimed to have been intimidated into silence by a decades-long campaign of harassment that had followed him from state to state. His dramatic story unleashed a wave of media interest, including newspaper stories, television reports, an interview with Oprah Winfrey, and an eventual book.</p> <p>Had Adams not come forward, the case might have fallen even further into obscurity. Instead, it became a symbol of the scars that racial violence had left on the American psyche \u2013 and the ways that rigorously enforced white silence, both past and present, had been integral to distorting and sanitising the history of that violence. The FBI, which had recently reopened a spate of cold cases from the civil rights era, added the Monroe lynching to the pile.</p> <p>The excitement of Adams\u2019s revelations did not last long: the FBI had lost much of the original evidence, and his testimony was riddled with contradictions and chronological errors that made it practically useless. But, whatever his motivations, he had successfully brought the story back to life.</p> <p>A few years later, in 1997, a small group of activists in Georgia, both black and white, began searching for ways to engrave the memory of the lynching on to the history of Walton County. Calling themselves the Moore\u2019s Ford Memorial Committee (after the bridge that crosses the Apalachee River by the site of the lynching), they began to hold community forums in which people could share their memories of the lynchings, and their experiences of racial violence. (For many decades after the end of Reconstruction<strong>, </strong>the county had been among the worst places in the country to be a free black American.)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"c083c9fa21eccc0c57f20ae6b4758d2802c7a212\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c083c9fa21eccc0c57f20ae6b4758d2802c7a212/0_258_8688_5213/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The historical marker sign at the roadside near the site of the Moore\u2019s Ford Bridge lynching.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The historical marker sign at the roadside near the site of the Moore\u2019s Ford Bridge lynching.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ben Rollins/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The activists pushed the state of Georgia to erect an official roadside sign to mark the site of the killings, which was put up in 1999. They combed through abandoned cemeteries until they found the victims\u2019 graves. That same year, they held an approximation of the military funeral George Dorsey had never received. (Lamar Howard, who had been beaten after daring to testify against the lynchers 53 years earlier, attended the service.) The activists received a steady trickle of death threats and hate mail, but they also slowly won local allies, including some white people.</p> <p>In 2005, Tyrone Brooks, a veteran of the southern civil rights movement who had become a Georgia state legislator, approached the activists in Monroe with a quixotic idea: a re-enactment. Just think, he urged the group, of how much media attention that would bring to the case \u2013 of the pressure it would put on the FBI.</p> <p>In the south, re-enactments are used primarily to commemorate <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/28/confederate-flag-civil-war-re-enactors\">the battles of the civil war</a>. They are often imbued, to varying degrees, with nostalgia for the \u201clost cause\u201d of the slaveholding Confederacy. So the suggestion that the activists might perform a lynching instead was \u201ca very mischievous idea\u201d, said Mark Auslander, an anthropologist who studies memorial rituals and has attended the Monroe event several times. \u201cRe-enactments are, in many ways, the prime currency of memorialisation in the south.\u201d But \u201cthey don\u2019t mention slavery, they don\u2019t mention Jim Crow, they don\u2019t mention lynchings\u201d. On the surface, each traditional re-enactment is an exercise in remembering; taken together, they represent a collective forgetting, in which the Confederacy is defined by nothing but the brave spirit of its soldiers.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/28/confederate-flag-civil-war-re-enactors\">Civil war re-enactors on the Confederate flag: 'It's complicated'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The idea of performing the lynching tore the Moore\u2019s Ford Memorial Committee apart, a split that was particularly painful because it occurred largely along racial lines. Many black members of the group (though certainly not all) found themselves drawn to the re-enactment. Most white members found the idea viscerally repellent: a confrontational spectacle unlikely to serve the cause of reconciliation. \u201cWe thought it was a step too far,\u201d Richard Rusk, one of committee\u2019s founding members, told me. \u201cMany steps too far. Totally inappropriate, too divisive. I mean, can you name one other place in the world where people get together to act out a horrible, disgusting piece of racial violence with absolutely no element of uplift? Can you?\u201d</p> <p>The first re-enactment took place in July 2005, an improvised and emotional performance for an audience that included <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/26/us/group-lynching-is-recreated-in-a-call-for-justice.html?_r=0\">a reporter for the New York Times</a> and civil rights luminaries such as Jesse Jackson and Joseph Lowery, Martin Luther King\u2019s successor as the president of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. It has been staged every year since.</p> <h2>* * * </h2> <p>Among the many logistical challenges of re-enacting a lynching, the greatest might be recruiting white cast members. Based on the available evidence, there were at least a dozen white men involved in the original crime. In recent years, the organisers have been lucky to get five or six. \u201cMost white people just refuse,\u201d Cassandra Greene, a 57-year-old Atlanta minister who has directed the re-enactment for the last eight years, told me. (She is black.) \u201cI ask everyone. I ask my white friends. They all say no. They all say: \u2018Oh, I could never do that.\u2019\u201d In the first year of the re-enactment, the four white men who had volunteered to portray the killers backed out at the last minute; the lynch mob was played by young black men wearing white plastic masks.</p> <p>Casting the black roles is only slightly easier, Greene told me. Some people she approaches act enthusiastic, then never show up for rehearsal. Some rehearse, but then back out before the actual performance. Some perform for a year or two, then drop out. \u201cI mean, I get it,\u201d she told me. \u201cIt hurts. It fills your mind with hurt. I haven\u2019t been on a date in years, and why not? Because I\u2019m thinking about all this instead.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"9b9e11f13b13c555192b1d4ab5ba069fd9cd7647\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9b9e11f13b13c555192b1d4ab5ba069fd9cd7647/0_319_8688_5213/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cassandra Greene, director of the Moore\u2019s Ford Lynching reenactment\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cassandra Greene, director of the Moore\u2019s Ford Bridge lynching reenactment.

It used me up.\u201d</p> <p>Two nights before this year\u2019s re-enactment, most of the cast gathered to rehearse at <a href=\"http://sightsandsoundsmuseum.org/\">Sights and Sounds</a>, a single-room museum of black American cultural artefacts \u2013 from fugitive slave posters to Jackson 5 records \u2013 housed in a moribund shopping mall in Decatur, a suburb of Atlanta about an hour\u2019s drive from Monroe. In its early incarnations, the cast was drawn mostly from Monroe \u2013 today a town of about 13,000 \u2013 and Walton County. But over the years, local participation has steadily declined. This year, every member of the all-volunteer cast was an Atlanta resident.</p> <p>The Malcolms and Dorseys were played by young actors trying to break into professional film and theatre. Only one had participated in the re-enactment before, and none had heard of the Moore\u2019s Ford lynching until Greene contacted them asking for their help. <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm7747276/\">Darrius Bradshaw</a>, who played Roger Malcolm, told me that during rehearsals \u2013 which, he reminded me, consisted largely of older white men calling him \u201cnigger,\u201d tying a noose around his neck, and pretending to shoot him repeatedly \u2013 he sometimes sank into depression, and sometimes flared into sudden fury. \u201cThen,\u201d he said, \u201clater, out in the real world, I\u2019d find myself back in those feelings, not even realising at first where they came from.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/aug/25/mike-brown-shooting-jim-crow-lynchings-in-common\">Mike Brown\u2019s shooting and Jim Crow lynchings have too much in common. It\u2019s time for America to own up | Isabel Wilkerson</a> </p> </aside>  <p>For the actors and the audience alike, it was impossible to ignore the charged significance of re-enacting the state-sanctioned murder of innocent black men and women at a moment when one candidate for president was running a campaign of undisguised racism \u2013 and police across the country were still killing unarmed black men with numbing regularity.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s even sadder this year,\u201d said <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm7551305/\">Lisa Searcy</a>, who played Mae Murray in 2015 and Dorothy this July. \u201cYou read the script, you rehearse, then you go home and turn on the news and you can\u2019t stop the tears.\u201d She did not mean to suggest, she quickly added, that 2016 was the same as 1946. \u201cBut the history really weighs on you hard.\u201d</p> <p>At last year\u2019s re-enactment, Searcy met a woman who introduced herself as a descendant of a man named <a href=\"https://scholarblogs.emory.edu/emorycoldcases/maceo-snipes/\">Maceo Snipes</a>. Five days before the lynching in Monroe, Snipes had been murdered in Taylor County, 100 miles to the south \u2013 for the offence of exercising his right to vote. (The winner of that election, Governor Eugene Talmadge, campaigned on a promise to ensure that Georgia\u2019s black population, then the largest in the nation, would never have access to the ballot box.)</p> <p>Later that night, when Searcy mentioned the story to her parents \u2013 who had family roots in Taylor County \u2013 they suddenly went silent. It turned out that she, too, was related to Snipes; her parents had never told her. At the time, Searcy told me, she couldn\u2019t understand their reticence. \u201cBut the more I thought about it, the more I got it,\u201d she said \u2013 especially once this year\u2019s rehearsals started. \u201cIt\u2019s sad, but I can understand now. I can feel this part of myself that would maybe turn away and not say anything. It\u2019s just too terrible. You don\u2019t want to touch it.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"6782d6d3ae3389a79f7f36a8431c45b26662faf3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6782d6d3ae3389a79f7f36a8431c45b26662faf3/0_1580_5687_7108/800.jpg\" alt=\"Actor Darrius Bradshaw, who played the role of Roger in the Moore\u2019s Ford lynching reenactment this year.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Actor Darrius Bradshaw, who played the role of Roger in the reenactment this year.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ben Rollins/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Most of the white cast members were not actors at all. One longtime participant, Bob Caine, is a descendant of <a href=\"http://observer.com/2015/08/100-year-anniversary-of-the-hanging-of-leo-frank/\">Leo Frank</a>, a Jewish man who was lynched in Atlanta in 1915, after being sentenced to life in prison for a crime he likely did not commit. Unhappy that Frank had not received the death penalty, a group of prominent white people (including a former governor of Georgia) broke into the prison where he was being held, abducted him and hung him from a tree.</p> <p>Wade Marbaugh, a 67-year-old journalist who for years has played the lynching crew\u2019s ringleader (and whose wife and daughters have also participated), smiled ruefully as he recalled his efforts to recruit his white neighbours and coworkers for the lynch mob. \u201cAt this point, they just ignore me. If it\u2019s email, they don\u2019t respond. If it\u2019s conversation, they cut it just as short as they can. These are people I\u2019ve known for years.\u201d</p> <p>This was frustrating, he said, but not impossible to understand. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy. It\u2019s not a TV show where the bad guys are the bad guys, and they\u2019re on the screen and you\u2019re in your chair.\u201d While preparing for his first performance, he drove out to Monroe and made his way to the site of the lynching. \u201cIt was just staggering,\u201d he said. \u201cIt knocked me down. I wept and wept.\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>A crucial feature of the re-enactment is that, by the standards commonly used to judge realist drama, it isn\u2019t particularly accomplished. The actors are either amateurs or apprentices still finding their way to whatever dramatic powers they might possess. It is hard for them to all get together to rehearse, especially because people drop out so frequently. Often, secondary members will have joined the production just a few days before the re-enactment.</p> <p>The budget hovers reliably around zero dollars, occasionally supplemented by infusions from Greene or other supporters. This means lots of 21st-century touches in the costumes; it means guns that look and sound like the plastic toys they are. The yellow Chevy \u2013 which is more 1950s than 1946 \u2013 is only rented for the day of the performance, so the cast doesn\u2019t get to use it in rehearsals. As a result, the key scene where the Malcolms and Dorseys are pulled from the car is marked by pauses in which the cast tries to pretend it isn\u2019t pausing to figure out who needs to reposition themselves where in order to keep the action moving.</p> <p>In stage plays and films, imperfections such as these can break the carefully cultivated spell of realism, or stop it from being cast in the first place. But as I watched the Malcolms and Dorseys get pulled from the yellow Chevy, I felt a claustrophobic flush of fear and shame more intense than any film could elicit. In the weeks leading up to the performance, I had heard stories of audience members crying, sobbing and calling out in pain. Even fierce critics of the re-enactment had admitted to me that, after attending out of curiosity, they had found it unexpectedly moving.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b9d7c22a3c26c18d02fcb41c90f496e1493aabc2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b9d7c22a3c26c18d02fcb41c90f496e1493aabc2/0_579_8688_5213/1000.jpg\" alt=\"the Moore\u2019s Ford Bridge lynching re-enactment.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018As I watched them get pulled from the yellow Chevy, I felt a claustrophobic flush of fear and shame\u2019 \u2026 the Moore\u2019s Ford Bridge lynching re-enactment.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ben Rollins/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In conversation after conversation, the same phrases kept popping up: like a dream; like a nightmare; slow-motion; unreal; super-real. And still I was shocked by the ragged intensity of my reaction. The scene in front of me wasn\u2019t a careful or tasteful copy of the past: it was a live, messy attempt to drag a heavy memory up into the light of day. Not so it could be changed or fixed \u2013 the moment was trapped in terrible amber; the Malcolms and Dorseys would not be saved \u2013 but simply to insist it could not be denied.</p> <p>The audience was almost entirely black, with a sprinkling of white people (myself included). Some of those present were old enough to remember the reign of the lynch mobs, and a small handful had actually been in Monroe on the day of the murders. Joseph Hunter, an 81-year-old black man who was visiting relatives near Monroe in the summer of 1946, approached me at a gathering held at Monroe\u2019s First Baptist Church before the re-enactment. What he remembered, he told me, was being suddenly yanked inside by his aunt when she got the news. \u201cShe closed the shades, she locked the door, and she said: \u2018Stay.\u2019\u201d His mother was in Connecticut, more than 800 miles away. As soon as she heard what had happened, she got in the car and drove continuously until she reached Hunter and his siblings the next day. \u201cShe had to have us close,\u201d he said.</p> <p>He has attended the re-enactment every year since it started, he said. But he couldn\u2019t always watch the whole thing: \u201cIt\u2019s too easy for me to imagine black people getting shot.\u201d The first few years, as the climax approached, he reflexively turned his back on the scene and walked away. \u201cI know it\u2019s not real,\u201d he told me. \u201cI know. But \u2026 \u201d He didn\u2019t finish the sentence.</p> <p>As the crowd followed the re-enactors off the road for the final scene, I watched Hunter pause and stare at the ground. After a few seconds, he lifted his head and slowly walked toward the river.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>The final moments of the re-enactment<strong> </strong>took barely a minute to play out, but they were were its slowest and most excruciating.</p> <p>The lynching crew tied their victims together and forced them onto the patch of fake turf. They stepped back, raised their plastic toy guns, and aimed. The ringleader counted down \u2013 three, two, one \u2013 and then the white men squeezed their triggers. In some past years, people have set off fireworks in the woods to simulate the gun shots; in others, the shooters have yelled \u201cPow! Pow!\u201d This year, there was no sound at all. The victims fell on to the patch of fake turf that had been laid out for this purpose. (In the past, actors who fell directly on the ground were painfully bitten by red ants in the grass.) As they collapsed, they burst bags of fake blood secreted in their shirts.</p> <p>For a moment, everyone \u2013 the shooters, the victims, the audience \u2013 was completely still. The victims, still bound by the ropes that had been tied around them, were pressed together on the ground.</p> <p>In 2005, when the re-enactment began, this was the moment where it concluded. But in the years since, more scenes have been added. Most of the new scenes take place earlier in the day, before the lynching itself, in spots around Walton County. The audience sees Roger Malcolm stab Barnette Hester, listens to gubernatorial candidate Eugene Talmadge froth at the mouth about the disgrace of black suffrage, and visits the victims\u2019 graves. But one addition has been tacked on after the shooting.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f2f42656209e86764ba42437071debb2d35fc861\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f2f42656209e86764ba42437071debb2d35fc861/0_528_8688_5213/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Spectators and camera crew at the final scene of the re-enactment\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Spectators and camera crew at the final scene of the re-enactment.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ben Rollins/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Bob Caine, the white re-enactor descended from Leo Frank, walked over to the dead bodies, and, after peering at them for a moment, bent down over Lisa Searcy and pressed his hands into her abdomen, as if he were cutting her open. When he stood up, he was clutching a plastic doll of a black baby, dripping with syrupy fake blood. A woman in the audience shrieked, and the rest watched \u2013 or kept filming \u2013 as Caine held up the baby for all to see, trying his best to look triumphant instead of sickened.</p> <p>There is no firm evidence that Dorothy Malcolm was pregnant when she was murdered (and strong evidence to suggest that she wasn\u2019t). But the rumour has always lurked around the edges of the story, and similar acts of foeticide have been documented in other lynchings. To many regular participants in the re-enactment, the unborn Malcolm baby has become a rich, central symbol: of the severity of racial violence, of the futures it made (and still makes) impossible, of the particular ways it did and does target black women. To others, though, the role of the unborn child is distasteful, even sickening. Several years ago, a group of white feminists involved in the re-enactment \u2013 including the previous director \u2013 left after failing to convince their castmates that the child should be removed from the script.</p> <p>\u201cThe re-enactment has a very complex relationship to what scholars call historical veracity,\u201d said Mark Auslander. \u201cOn one hand, it appears to be about honouring and remembering exactly what happened in this particular spot in this particular day. On the other hand, it\u2019s about the creation of resonant myths and rituals. Re-enactors might say that they\u2019re doing it to educate, or to push the FBI to prosecute. That\u2019s not untrue, but it\u2019s a partial explanation.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe summon up the spirit and presence of the dead for all kinds of reasons,\u201d Auslander continued. \u201cWe do it to get to know the dead, to spend time with them, to continue life in the face of death. That\u2019s what gives the re-enactment its force, its aliveness, and that\u2019s what makes it so draining for everyone who touches it.\u201d</p> <p>Racism in America has always been a matter of power \u2013 to enslave, to kill without consequence, to oppress, to segregate, to silence. But it has also been about the power to determine which memories the country sanctifies and which it discards. White America\u2019s preference \u2013 the preference of power, that is \u2013 has been for stories of progress and redemption, of national injury stitched up and healed over. The re-enactment in Monroe is a different type of story: an open wound that has festered for 70 years of repression and neglect. This what makes it necessary for some people, and unbearable for others.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/feb/16/suspects-1946-moores-ford-bridge-georgia-mass-lynching-alive\">FBI investigates claim suspects in 1946 Georgia mass lynching may be alive</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Technically, the case remains open. In 2008, local newspapers reported that FBI agents were digging up land in Monroe to look for guns used in the lynching. As recently as last year, federal agents were conducting interviews in the area. But even the most impassioned activists admit that no charges are likely to materialise.</p> <p>Every year, the re-enactment concludes with a song, performed while the victims lie motionless on the ground. This year, an Atlanta jazz singer, Ja\u2019Naan, sang Strange Fruit, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/feb/16/protest-songs-billie-holiday-strange-fruit\">the haunting protest song</a> about lynchings made famous by Billie Holliday. Two days earlier, at the final rehearsal, I watched her deliver the song with practised poise. Now, her voice cracked and her body shook. The victims tried their best to remain completely still. Cassandra Greene, the director, watched from the sidelines, sobbing.</p> <p>On 25 July 1946, just hours after the Malcolms and Dorseys were murdered, white people from Monroe and the surrounding towns started driving to Moore\u2019s Ford Bridge. They had heard through the local rumour mill about what had just happened, and now they wanted souvenirs, like the spectators of lynchings past. Policemen had already snatched up most of the bullets and rope for their own personal collections, but there were still some scraps of clothing at the scene. One college student found a tooth, which he gave to a female friend, who put it on her charm bracelet. Many people took pictures, posing with bloodstains or bullet holes in the trees nearby.</p> <p>When the singing came to a stop, the audience did not turn away. They moved closer, walking toward the victims, holding their phones and tablets aloft, to claim these images as their own.</p> <p>\u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gdnlongread?ref_src=twsrc^google|twcamp^serp|twgr^author\">@gdnlongread</a>, or sign up to the long read weekly email <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2015/jul/20/sign-up-to-the-long-read-email\">here</a>.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>Producing in-depth, thoughtful, well-reported journalism like the Long Read is difficult and expensive \u2013 but supporting us isn\u2019t.

It said a non-Muslim should not become a leader of Muslims.</p> <p>The southeast Asian nation has a history of sporadic and isolated violence against Christian as well as its large ethnic Chinese minority, many of whom are Buddhists.</p> <p>International militant jihadists, some with influence and members in Indonesia, are looking to capitalise on the anti-Ahok sentiment.</p> <p>Last month, al Qaida\u2019s branch in Syria, Jabhat Fatah al-Sham, said that Indonesia should sentence Ahok or it would \u201csentence him with bullets\u2019. And ISIS supporters have sent messages to their supporters asking them to use the rally \u2018to fan the flames of jihad\u2019.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s clear that everyone is worried about violence, and huge numbers of police and soldiers have been called up for duty,\u201d said Sidney Jones, the director of the Institute for Policy Analysis of Conflict.<br></p> <p>The governor is looking toward a February election and looks likely to win. He is politically close with president Widodo, who also served as Jakarta governor for 18 months before rising to the country\u2019s highest office and handing over to Ahok.</p> <p>But Jones said that supporters of Anies Baswedan, a former minister of education who is second behind Ahok in the gubernatorial race, are exploiting the potentially explosive upheaval to damage him politically.</p> <p>\u201cThe problem is that there are too many interests involved here: Ahok\u2019s rivals would like to decrease his likelihood of winning; hardline civil society groups want to show that they control the streets; pro-shariah groups want to show massive support for Islamic law; the tiny jihadi groups are urging their members to show their courage by attacking police.\u201d</p>",

I guess this series was always meant to go to seven games. What this game lacked in drama, it seemed to be all but finished after the Russell grand slam, it felt way more tense than any six run game should ever be. I guess it comes down to how high the stakes are for both teams.</p> <p>In any case that will end today\u2019s liveblog, but stay tuned here at the Guardian for continued coverage as the World Series comes to a close.

The bad news? This series is heading back to Progressive Field and the Cubs have zero margin of error, one loss to the Indians and this series is over.</p> <p>It should be a great pitching matchup today, with the Cubs starting last year\u2019s Cy Young winner Jake Arrieta (18-18, 3:10) against Josh Tomlin (13-9, 4.40), who has allowed just 4 runs in 3 postseason games. <br></p> <p>This might be the most important game in Cubs history since 1945, although that distinction would change should they force a Game 7.

According to the ABC/Washington Post tracking <a href=\"http://www.langerresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/1184a102016ElectionTrackingNo10.pdf\">poll</a> published on Tuesday (conducted October 27-30), the Democratic candidate has now slipped behind Donald Trump, on 45% to her Republican opponent\u2019s 46%. The polling <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/us/general_election_trump_vs_clinton-5491.html\">average</a> calculated by RealClearPolitics, a much better indication of national sentiment, shows Clinton is now leading by just 2 percentage points, down from 5 percentage points a week ago.</p> <p>Those numbers are interesting but not necessarily indicative \u2013 polling won\u2019t neatly translate to votes. Far more important will be the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2016/oct/29/voter-turnout-us-election-2016-register\">turnout</a> - especially since the two leading presidential candidates are so <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/31/polls-donald-trump-hillary-clinton-unpopularity\">close in terms of unpopularity</a>. And the candidates know it. A senior adviser to Donald Trump reportedly <a href=\"http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/303034-trump-aide-we-have-three-major-voter-suppression\">revealed</a> last week that \u201cwe have three major voter suppression operations under way\u201d intended to reduce votes for Clinton among African Americans, white liberals and young women.<br></p> <p>Even though election day is still a week away, we already have some clues about whether turnout is lower among those groups \u2013 because more than <a href=\"http://www.electproject.org/early_2016\">25m</a> ballots have already been cast under the US early voting system. Approximately 125 million to 145 million Americans are <a href=\"https://www.predictit.org/Market/2188/What-will-be-2016-voter-turnout-for-the-presidential-election\">predicted</a> to vote in the 2016 election, so those early votes represent a significant share of the expected total.</p> <h2><strong>Higher turnout than at this time in 2012</strong></h2> <p>Of the 15 states that provide detailed information about those ballots, North Carolina, California and nine other states report <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/10/31/us/elections/earlyvoters.html?_r=0\">more</a> early voters than at the same point in the 2012 election. Ohio, Nevada, Colorado and Iowa showed a decline in early voting, and those declines were small.</p> <h2><strong>Early signs of declining turnout from black voters and young voters</strong></h2> <p>The early results offer mixed news for Clinton. Early votes suggest that young voters \u2013 who are much <a href=\"http://www.people-press.org/2015/04/07/a-deep-dive-into-party-affiliation/\">more likely</a> than older voters to lean Democratic \u2013 might be staying at home. In 12 states, fewer Americans aged 18 to 29 have cast a ballot so far in this election compared with this point in 2012. This could be especially problematic for Clinton if this group is indicative of a broader \u201c<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/1031867576877207/\">Bernie or bust</a>\u201d sentiment in which supporters of the former Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders choose to stay at home rather than voting for Clinton.<br></p> <p>Young voters aren\u2019t the only demographic group that appears put off. Early votes suggest that black turnout has fallen in eight states \u2013 especially in North Carolina, a state that yields <a href=\"https://www.archives.gov/federal-register/electoral-college/allocation.html\">15 of the 270</a> electoral college votes needed to win the election and where polling suggests Clinton is in a <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/nc/north_carolina_trump_vs_clinton-5538.html\">close contest</a>. If Trump\u2019s strategy is indeed to suppress the black vote, that makes a lot of sense \u2013 those voters could be crucial for Clinton to secure the White House.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/01/clinton-trump-polls-election-voter-turnout-suppression\">Election polls tighten \u2013 but turnout is the real key to Clinton v Trump</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58192559e4b07ceadb3a169c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-01T23:31:01.602Z\">11.31pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Speaking in Eau Claire, Wisconsin, Donald Trump predicted \u201can unprecedented constitutional crisis\u201d if Hillary Clinton were to be elected president.</p> <p>\u201cThe work of government would come to an unbelievably unglorious halt,\u201d Trump said, and \u201cshe is likely to be investigated for years, likely to be concluded with a very large-scale criminal trial.\u201d</p> <p>The audience chanted \u201cLock her up!\u201d in response.</p> <p>\u201cThis is a message for any Democratic voter who have already cast their ballot for Hillary Clinton and have a severe case of buyer\u2019s remorse,\u201d Trump said, referring to a few states - Wisconsin included - where early ballots can be reversed before election day. \u201cA lot of stuff has come out since you\u2019ve voted.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou can change your vote to Donald Trump - we\u2019ll make America great again, okay?

Willy Caballero, John Stones and Sterling were all guilty of wasting possession inside the opening 10 minutes and their defensive structure was non-existent when Messi opened the scoring after a ridiculous one-two with Neymar that swept the length of the pitch. Ag\u00fcero was one of six City players inside the Barcelona area when his shot was blocked by Mascherano \u2013 a seventh, Pablo Zabaleta, had continued his run off the pitch \u2013 and Messi seized on the rebound and the chasm to score within seconds.</p> <p>It was another painful lesson of Barcelona\u2019s exquisite ruthlessness, not that City required another after five successive Champions League defeats, but the quality of the response from the home side was equally&#xa0;impressive.</p> <p>Ag\u00fcero was central to the City comeback with his selflessness rather than the finishing for which he is renowned. The striker took receipt of Sergi Roberto\u2019s foolish pass to release Sterling behind the visiting defence for G\u00fcndogan\u2019s equaliser. Another measured ball into the England international should have produced City\u2019s second shortly after the restart, only for Sterling to inexplicably decline the first-time shot, miscontrol and eventually find the side-netting.</p> <p>Controversy surrounded the striker\u2019s involvement in City\u2019s third goal when he appeared to deliberately handball a cross from Jes\u00fas Navas before G\u00fcndogan applied the last, emphatic touch. The final telling counterattack of an enthralling game, however, commenced with an Ag\u00fcero tackle on Messi on the edge of the City area and continued when the striker drove at the heart of the visiting rearguard.</p> <p>Finally, after the misery of five previous Champions League defeats and the deflation of missing out at the Camp Nou, Ag\u00fcero had put one over his long-time friend from&#xa0;Argentina.</p>",

The practice has devastated the environment, according to Earthworks and locals, turning thousands of hectares of verdant forest and mangroves into wasteland and rendering turgid the once-crystal waters of the highlands.</p> <p>The tailings from the Grasberg mine are so rich with ore that Papuans walk for as long as a week to get here. Crowding the length of the river and the delta wasteland, thousands of unlicensed panners shore up small sections to slow the river\u2019s flow and dig into the thick sediment on the side.  </p> <p>Although some of these panners are located within Freeport\u2019s official mining operations, they are not evicted or controlled in any way, they said.

Under Indonesian law, Freeport is a designated \u201cstrategic industry\u201d, which mandates that external security for the mine, its access roads and its pipelines all be provided exclusively by Indonesia\u2019s security forces. Freeport has <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-14417718\">never been implicated in any human rights</a> abuses allegedly committed by the Indonesian military in Papua. </p> <p>Freeport McMoRan, based in Phoenix, Arizona, did not respond to multiple requests for comment. </p> <p>The company\u2019s website defends its method of disposal of tailings at Grasberg, managed by PT Freeport Indonesia (PTFI), an affiliate company: \u201cPTFI\u2019s controlled riverine tailings management system, which has been approved by the Indonesian government, uses the unnavigable river system in the mountainous highlands near our mine to transport tailings to an engineered area in the lowlands where the tailings and other sediments are managed in a deposition area.\u201d </p> <p>A <a href=\"http://www.circleofblue.org/2012/world/global-gold-rush-the-price-of-mining-pursuits-on-water-supply/\">2009 report by the company</a> says it utilises levees to contain tailings in the deposition area, and that the tailings management programme costs Freeport McMoRan $15.5m (\u00a312.7m) each year. According to the report, company monitoring of aquatic life in the rivers found that fish and shrimp were suitable for consumption, as regulated by Indonesian food standards, while water quality samples met Indonesian and US Environmental Protection Agency drinking water standards for dissolved metals. In a <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-14417718\">2011 BBC report</a> on alleged pollution in the area surrounding Grasberg, the company says that the tailings management method was chosen because studies showed the environmental impact caused by its waste material was reversible.<br></p> <p>Elsewhere on its website, the company says: \u201cWe are committed to respecting human rights. Our <a href=\"http://www.fcx.com/sd/pdf/hr_policy.pdf\">human rights policy</a> requires us (and our contractors) to conduct business in a manner consistent with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and to align our human rights due diligence practices with the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UN Guiding Principles).\u201d</p> <p>The company also emphasises its work with indigenous people in West Papua. A 2015 Freeport McRoRan report on working towards sustainable development said: \u201cPTFI has engaged with indigenous Papuan tribes for decades, including through numerous formal agreements to promote workforce skills training, health, education and basic infrastructure development \u2026 In 2015, PTFI continued to evaluate the effectiveness of alternate options for Kamoro community members whose estuary transport routes are impacted by sedimentation associated with the controlled riverine tailings management system. Provision of smaller sized boats, in addition to 50 passenger vessels, for route flexibility as well as additional local economic development programmes were identified as additional mitigation measures during the year.\u201d</p> <p>Back in the area surrounding the Grasberg mine, many Papuans, struggling for work, find themselves pulled into the bar and sex industries that cater to the miners, particularly around the highland village of Banti.

A further tumble in the exchange rate could push inflation even higher.</p> <p>Simon Kirby, an NIESR economist, said: \u201cThe depreciation of sterling has been the most striking feature of the post-referendum economic landscape.

While we expect this to be only a temporary phenomenon, it will nonetheless weigh on the purchasing power of consumers over the next couple of years.\u201d</p> <p>Consumer spending has propped up GDP growth in the last year after a sharp downturn in construction and weaker manufacturing sector, which has lost momentum in response to slowing growth in global trade.</p> <p>The most recent assessment of the UK economy by the Office for National Statistics showed that manufacturing contracted in the three months to the end of September by 1%. A survey of manufacturers in October found that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/11/pound-completes-worst-four-day-performance-since-brexit-vote\">the sharp fall in the value of the pound</a> since the EU referendum had helped to increase exports, but also forced manufacturers to raise the price of their goods at the fastest rate in more than five years.</p> <p>The latest Markit/CIPS manufacturing purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI) survey for October suggested that firms are starting to pass on higher import costs as the weak pound makes raw materials such as oil more expensive. Prices of everyday items including clothing, wine, bread and fruit are expected to come under increasing pressure as Brexit nears. However, the weak exchange rate also helped to boost orders from the US, the EU and China.<br></p> <p>Rob Dobson, a senior economist at IHS Markit and an author of the report, said the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/manufacturing-sector\">manufacturing sector</a> should return to growth in the fourth quarter.</p>",
  "<p>One loosely applied law for the rich. Another tightly monitored one for the poor. Next&#xa0;Monday, the government reduces the total amount of benefits families are allowed to claim. Using the Department for Work and Pensions\u2019 own figures, 88,000 families with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/31/child-poverty-theresa-may-housing-benefit-cuts\" title=\"\">a quarter of a million children</a> will have to manage on less money. A lot less: the average cut will be \u00a3260 a month. Sums that large spell eviction and homelessness for many. Independent experts expect the turmoil to be&#xa0;even greater.</p> <p>Not so long ago, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/jul/07/benefit-cap-pitch-children-poverty-12bn-cuts-tory-budget\" title=\"\">the Conservatives vowed to end child poverty</a>. Now they are enacting laws to create not just poverty, but generations of destitution. Nor are they alone in this project. The benefits cap was brought in by the Conservative-Lib Dem coalition. It was endorsed by Ed Miliband\u2019s Labour party. As acting leader last year, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/jul/12/harman-labour-not-vote-against-welfare-bill-limit-child-tax-credits\" title=\"\">Harriet Harman instructed Labour MPs not to oppose the reduction of the cap</a>. Still, the fact remains that the benefit cap was a Conservative idea.</p> <p>Meanwhile, as a report from the Resolution Foundation points out this morning, the Conservatives have since 2010 brought in tax cut after tax cut, worth a total \u00a332bn this year. Set that against the reduction of the benefit cap, which will inflict chaos on hundreds of thousands of the poorest to raise a measly \u00a365m this year. Over George Osborne\u2019s six years in No 11, corporation tax rates have been slashed. The threshold at which personal income is taxed has risen to over \u00a310,000 and will next year hit \u00a311,500. Under&#xa0;the party that once promised \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/apr/22/cameron-coalition-green-policies-one-year\" title=\"\">vote blue, go green</a>\u201d, fuel duty was first cut and then frozen. These giveaways have gone largely to big business and to the rich. The&#xa0;rise in the personal income tax threshold was sold by Nick Clegg and David Cameron as a way of boosting the living standards of the working poor. It was actually a hugely expensive sop&#xa0;to the rich.</p> <p>Then there is the kid-glove treatment of the super-rich, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/01/hmrc-investigating-19bn-in-potential-tax-avoidance-by-super-rich\" title=\"\">as detailed by the National Audit Office yesterday</a>. The NAO report is not political, yet its investigation is a must-read for all those who want to get to grips with the government\u2019s austerity project. Tax inspectors have identified potential evasion or avoidance worth \u00a32bn among 6,500 super-rich individuals. Of those, only two individuals have been criminally investigated, with one single prosecution. Tax inspectors have identified a variety of ways in which the very wealthy game the system: from failing to declare foreign income to investing in schemes that are sold as tax dodges. The NAO points out that hundreds of millions stand to be collected from enforcing the law. It also paints a picture in which the tax inspectors are outnumbered and outgunned by the super-wealthy and their armies of advisers.</p> <p>Theresa May\u2019s promise is \u201ca country that works for all\u201d. Yet she has been involved in and is now in charge of an austerity project that does the opposite: pushing the poorest deeper into poverty while letting the richest off scot-free. If the prime minister wants to make good on her pledges of social justice, she has her chance in the autumn statement later this month. She can follow Labour\u2019s suggestion of giving more money and more firepower to the tax inspectors. She can reverse the wasteful giveaway on income tax thresholds. And she can roll back the cuts to social security and public spending. Here\u2019s&#xa0;her chance; let\u2019s hope she takes it.</p>"
