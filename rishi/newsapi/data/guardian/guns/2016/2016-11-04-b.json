Although he did not give a direct answer to the question, the 53-year-old said: \u201cHe is playing well for the team. He\u2019s creating a lot of chances and missing a lot of goals. If I remember Stoke, Liverpool, Chelsea, Burnley, he missed a lot of goals but he was fantastic in his dynamic, his working, his building up for the team, he was fantastic.</p> <p>\u201c[Against Fenerbahce] I cannot say the same. But in every match in the Premier League, even not scoring goals he\u2019s being fantastic. His attitude is always brilliant. He\u2019s not a guy afraid of his responsibility, so no problem at all.</p> <p>\u201cSometimes a team doesn\u2019t score goals because of its philosophy, because the team isn\u2019t aggressive enough and doesn\u2019t risk enough. That\u2019s not our case at all. But it\u2019s easy to see that some players lack confidence in attacking areas and they are not getting the chances they can.</p> <p>\u201cProbably one of the only good things [about Fenerbahce] was the fact that Rooney finally scored a goal. Maybe it\u2019s also a key point in terms of his self-confidence.\u201d That was only the captain\u2019s second of the season.</p> <p>Pogba\u2019s availability is in doubt because of a leg injury. \u201cThe first two fouls in the game \u2013 [Morgan] Schneiderlin and [Ander] Herrera \u2013 got two yellow cards,\u201d Mourinho said. \u201cThe foul on Pogba that brought him out of the game was not a yellow card.\u201d</p> <p>The loss to Dick Advocaat\u2019s side was marked by a lack of direction that allowed Moussa Sow to score after 69 seconds. This followed Pedro\u2019s goal in 30 seconds in the 4-0 defeat at Chelsea last month.</p> <p>Mourinho believes leadership is missing. \u201cIt can happen everywhere. There are so many examples in football where people score goals in the first minutes. Nobody is free of that. But with a stronger attitude, leadership on the pitch, defenders in control of the emotion and the organisation, it\u2019s easier to be strong and be solid,\u201d he said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/nov/04/jose-mourinho-manchester-united-third-season-syndrome\">Has Jos\u00e9 Mourinho already got third-season syndrome at Manchester United? | Jamie Jackson</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Put to the manager that it is unusual for one of his sides to allow such early strikes in two games, Mourinho referred to the injuries to Chris Smalling and Eric Bailly which forced him to select Daley Blind and Marcos Rojo at centre-back.</p> <p>\u201cYou never saw a Jos\u00e9 Mourinho team play with two left-backs as central defenders,\u201d he said. \u201cI cannot be critical of the boys because they do what they can. They try their best. For Daley it is even more difficult to play central defender on the right side. It is completely uncomfortable for him. He cannot be a good builder of the game when this is one of his good qualities. Marcos is trying hard and is fine, but it\u2019s a very important starting point for the stability of the team. Even in matches where we didn\u2019t concede goals with them against Man City and Burnley were home matches and we managed to play with a high percentage of the ball and managed to play with the defensive line almost in the midfield.\u201d</p> <p>Despite Bastian Schweinsteiger now training again he is not in contention for Swansea. \u201cNo, because I decide and I decide no,\u201d Mourinho said. \u201cIt\u2019s too early for him. He\u2019s training with the team for three or four days. He\u2019s not ready to play football at that level.\u201d</p> <p>Antonio Valencia is also injured and with Ander Herrera suspended and Mourinho serving his touchline ban at the Liberty Stadium the manager was asked how difficult it would be to execute his duties from the stands. \u201cForget it,\u201d he said.</p>",

Nelson and Lloyd are about to celebrate their 20th birthdays \u2013 on Saturday for Lloyd, next weekend for Nelson \u2013 while Kay is relatively senior at 21, and Dickinson is 18, fresh from riding the European Championships a few weeks ago as a junior, and such a new inclusion in the squad she has barely trained with her team mates.</p> <p>The quintet timed their run perfectly for this World Cup.

At the same time Italy\u2019s Simone Frapporti swung up for one last time, leaving both teams with the minimum three counters in the final kilometre.</p> <p>It then came down to who had most strength left and when Maria-Giulia Confalioneri slipped off the back of the Italian string with two laps remaining, the crowd sensed a gold medal was imminent if the three British women could keep close to each other\u2019s wheels. By the gun Confalioneri was half a dozen lengths adrift of her team-mates, while the young Britons hung together, inspired by the crowd, according to Kay.</p> <p>\u201cWhen you go into a ride like that and know it\u2019s going to be close, you try to keep to your ride,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can hear the crowd.

  "<p>As Indonesia\u2019s president, Joko \u201cJokowi\u201d Widodo, touches down in Australia  for the first time since assuming the presidency, will human rights feature at all in the talks?

If it was left up to me, I would twist their ears.\u201d</p> <p>Although Australia has consistently supported Indonesian sovereignty over Papua, the issue remains one of various sensitivities in the Australia\u2013Indonesia relationship. But that discomfort does not give Indonesia a free pass to commit human rights abuses in the province, nor should Australia shy away from discussing such matters at the highest levels.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/17/indonesia-accused-of-arresting-more-than-1000-in-west-papua\">Indonesia accused of arresting more than 1,000 in West Papua</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The provinces of Papua and West Papua are a remote, isolated region, where the OPM (Free Papua Movement) has led a low-level insurgency for decades. That insurgency has long been the excuse for significant military involvement in Papua. With the heightened police and military presence, there have been reports of security force abuses including killings, torture, excessive or unnecessary use of force, and mistreatment of peaceful protesters.</p> <p>At least 37 Papuans remain behind bars for peaceful acts of free expression or expressing solidarity with the independence movement. All of this impunity is aided by reduced scrutiny of abuses as foreign journalists and human rights organisations face a half century-long restriction on visiting the province.</p> <p>Perhaps Indonesia feels especially confident in rallying Australian support, since it scored something of a coup in August with the Papua visit by the attorney general, George Brandis. He was the first Australian cabinet minister to <a href=\"https://www.attorneygeneral.gov.au/Mediareleases/Pages/2016/ThirdQuarter/Visit-To-Papua-Province.aspx\">visit</a> Papua, and human rights were <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2016/08/22/australia-continues-be-shamefully-silent-indonesias-human-rights-abuses\">glaringly absent</a> from all public statements he made about that visit.

Let\u2019s remember that Jokowi himself has previously called for <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2015/01/12/papuans-have-heard-jokowis-promises-president-listening\">greater respect for human rights in Papua</a> and for the Indonesian government to stop <a href=\"http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2014/06/05/jokowi-open-access-papua-foreign-journalists-int-l-organizations.html\">blocking foreign journalists and observers from visiting Papua</a>.</p> <p>Here\u2019s one suggestion that Turnbull could broach with Jokowi: if Indonesian officials are so keen to gain Australia\u2019s support on Papua, then why not allow a multi-party parliamentary delegation from Australia, accompanied by journalists, free access to visit the province? </p> <p>Australia\u2019s parliament has long had an interest in the region, with a Parliamentary Friends of West Papua group co-chaired by Jane Prentice MP and Senator Richard Di Natale. Such a visit, not a junket, should include a range of Australian politicians armed with expertise in trade, tourism, economic and social portfolios and include meetings with Papuan leaders, civil society, imprisoned activists and ordinary Papuans.</p> <p>In fact, when General Luhut Pandjaitan, then coordinating minister for political, legal and security affairs, visited Canberra in June he extended an invitation to the Australian government to visit Papua, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dJfVIesb0k\">saying</a>, </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I ask also any member of the cabinet to join us to go there. We have nothing to hide. It is not the time to hide something. Let us work together to make it transparent. If you want to criticise Indonesia we are happy to receive that criticism. But please, give that criticism based on data, not rumour.</p> </blockquote> <p>A visit would help Australian politicians understand more about a region only a few hundred kilometres to our north that remains isolated and undeveloped. It would enable Australians to hear directly from Papuans about the issues affecting their lives \u2013 surely this is part of what Jokowi wants in trying to win the <a href=\"http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2016/10/21/papua-priority.html\">hearts and minds</a> of Papuans.</p> <p><em>Elaine Pearson is the Australia director at Human Rights Watch.</em></p>",

He has these heavy eyelids and laid-back nature that I think I have.\u201d</p> <p>Pepe first became a meme in around 2008. People were lifting frames from the comic book, particularly one where Pepe has pulled his pants all the way down to pee and says \u201c<a href=\"http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/feels-good-man\">feels good, man</a>\u201d and another where Pepe is consoling himself about his lack of success with women, saying \u201cat least I have time for a pizza on a bagel\u201d and adding their own captions. \u201cThen the <a href=\"http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/feels-bad-man-sad-frog\">Sad Frog took off</a>,\u201d said Furie, referencing a meme that flipped \u201cfeels good man\u201d on its head.</p> <p>\u201cIt just started to have a life of its own. All these versions of Pepe having different personalities \u2013 smug, sad or really violent and weird,\u201d said Furie, citing a \u201cscatological and weirdly graphic\u201d version known as Poo Poo Pee Pee Pepe [<a href=\"https://pics.onsizzle.com/bestfie-%E3%83%8E-c-ultra-edgy-poo-poo-pee-pee-best-2720345.png\">NSFW</a>].</p> <p>Pepe\u2019s success was international, and he won major followings in China and Korea. \u201cPepe transcends all these kind of sociological boundaries. He\u2019s just a cartoon frog that\u2019s sad and people can relate to that.\u201d</p> <p>That all changed on 12 September, when Hillary Clinton posted an explainer about <a href=\"https://www.hillaryclinton.com/feed/donald-trump-pepe-the-frog-and-white-supremacists-an-explainer/\">Pepe the Frog becoming a racist hate symbol</a>.

It becomes an internet thing.\u201d However, when ADL credited him as the creator of Pepe, he realized he had to intervene.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s the worst-case scenario for any artist to lose control of their work and eventually have it labelled like a swastika or a burning cross,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cI had to step up and speak on the cartoon frog\u2019s behalf.\u201d</p> <p>Furie has collected about 600 positive or peaceful frog memes being generated by the #SavePepe campaign. He plans to incorporate these into what he calls a \u201cPeace Pepe Database of Love\u201d, an online resource for people who want to support his campaign to cement Pepe\u2019s reputation as a \u201cstoned, chilled frog\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI would like to get the frog off the hate database.

The second most WTF-laden intro was in the Daily Mail, which assigned ark-of-the-covenant-like qualities to a leaflet whose only prior claim to fame was being dismissed as a biased disgrace in the Daily Mail. As Friday\u2019s paper had it: \u201cMPs last night accused judges of failing to read the \u00a39m taxpayer-funded publicity leaflet that stated the referendum result would be followed directly by ministers.\u201d Wait \u2013 MPs accused judges of failing to read a leaflet? Did they also accuse them of failing to follow the rules of Bootcamp? Can we settle this with an immunity task/a sing-off in the karaokosseum/ a catfight between the leaflet and the bus?

The mean judge <a href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMeanBrit\" title=\"\">is always a Brit</a> \u2013 and in this case, there are three of them.

Just over a year later, Bush was agitating to invade Iraq, a choice whose consequences we live with still.

  "<p>The rule of law is the bedrock of a democratic society. It can check corruption and abuses of power. It permits individuals to order their lives. It allows private corporations, public bodies and the executive to regulate effectively their own activities. If the rule of law is to be upheld, it is vital that there should be an independent judiciary. This fact appears lost on Brexiter rabble-rousers. This voluble, influential political sect has unleashed gales of fury on the high court judges who ruled that only parliament has the authority to trigger article 50 of the Treaty on European Union, the legal route for Britain to leave the EU. Leading the charge are rightwing newspapers, which claim themselves to be champions of free speech and traditional British liberties. Yet since the Brexit vote they have sought to delegitimise their opponents\u2019 views and silence them through intimidation. This morning these newspapers laced racial innuendo with accusations of treachery, casting themselves as representatives of the people against unelected <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3903436/Enemies-people-Fury-touch-judges-defied-17-4m-Brexit-voters-trigger-constitutional-crisis.html\" title=\"\">\u201cout of touch\u201d </a>judges and their <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheSun/status/794306826141630466\" title=\"\">\u201cloaded foreign elite\u201d</a> remainer acolytes.</p> <p>This is rhetoric that goes beyond character assassination and rightwing posturing into something darker and more dangerous. Remember, we are only months away from the gunning down of a pro-remain MP in broad daylight. During the course of this case, the bench \u2013 headed by the lord chief justice \u2013 was compelled to remind the gallery that threats against the claimants would be taken as contempt of court. The hysterical, and frankly ludicrous, response to the ruling was to claim that the judges\u2019 decision had <a href=\"http://www.express.co.uk/comment/expresscomment/728602/Brexit-judges-block-leave-EU-referendum-High-Court\" title=\"\">sparked a crisis akin to that faced by Winston Churchill during world war two when he called on Britons to \u201cfight them on the beaches\u201d.</a> This intolerance threatens to undermine political freedom and judicial independence. No court is infallible. One can dissent from judgments without trying, via newsprint and social media, to shatter a nation\u2019s confidence in judges as impartial guardians of the rule of law. Judges don\u2019t do opinions unless they are legal ones. Hence the need for politicians to speak up.</p> <p>So we ask: where is the prime minister in all this? Has she lost sight of the obvious \u2013 that the rule of law requires that the courts have jurisdiction to scrutinise the actions of government to ensure that they are lawful? Where, pray, is the lord chancellor, Liz Truss, who \u2013 as former office-bearer Charles Falconer notes \u2013 has a constitutional duty to defend the judges? The government will have its appeal heard in the supreme court next month. Unless ministers make clear their support for the judiciary, it looks as if the government is colluding to try to cow the highest courts in the land. The high court used Jacobean case law \u2013 \u201cthe King by his proclamation or other ways cannot change any part of the common law, or statute law, or the customs of the realm\u201d \u2013 to spike the government case that ministers have a right to invoke article 50 under the royal prerogative. The citizen must be able to challenge the executive before an independent judiciary. Because it is the executive that exercises the power of the state and because it is the executive which is a frequent litigator in the courts, it is from executive pressure or influence that judges require particularly to be protected. By standing by, ministers are encouraging mobocracy to overwhelm the rule of law.</p>",

The state of the industry was a constant water-cooler topic in the public radio office I worked in, and everything felt flat and ambivalent when it came to what would happen next.</p> <p>Then Cablegate happened. Specifically, a cache of over 400,000 US cables, war logs, and other confidential documents regarding the Iraq and Afghanistan wars were released by WikiLeaks in 2010, who had turned them over to the New York Times, the Guardian, and other outlets for publication. I had read the Guardian plenty before then (mainly arts and culture pieces), but since I\u2019m American, it was never as much of a cultural cornerstone as NYT. However, as the paper began publishing more on WikiLeaks, I found myself opened to an entirely new world of coverage, thanks to <a href=\"http://www.nickdavies.net/\" title=\"\">Nick Davies</a> and a masterful feature on WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange. In an old paper for my law, policy and ethics course, I referred (pretentiously) to the leaks and corresponding coverage as \u201cthe Pentagon Papers of my generation\u201d.</p> <p>I can\u2019t say the same for Assange, but my fondness for the Guardian has only grown since then. The last few years have seen me falling in love with pieces by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/owen-jones\" title=\"\">Owen Jones</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/abi-wilkinson\" title=\"\">Abi Wilkinson</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/rafaelbehr\" title=\"\">Rafael Behr</a>, spanning topics from millennials to Boris Johnson to anti-semitism. Most recently, the paper\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\" title=\"\">Brexit coverage</a> \u2013 and the impending doom that comes with it \u2013 has been provocatively excellent, and I continually find new voices and reasons to keep reading.

When Nigel Farage threatens those parliamentarians who delay or block Brexit with public anger (which he will do his best to provoke), he is denying parliament the right to hold the executive to account.

Politicians such as these when they speak of the will of the people are using it as a means of removing from the constitution all those elements that they don\u2019t like, in particular&#xa0;those that protect the rights&#xa0;of&#xa0;minorities, in this case the 48% who voted remain. The Brexit debate is&#xa0;no longer just a debate on EU membership but a fight to retain those elements of the British&#xa0;constitution that make it a liberal democracy.<br><strong>Derrick Joad</strong><br><em>Leeds</em></p> <p>\u2022 The Burkean philosophy quoted by your correspondent (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/nov/03/moving-forward-from-the-high-courts-article-50-ruling\" title=\"\">Letters</a> 3 November) is the root of arrogance and self-righteousness of some members of parliament. Burke\u2019s flowery language can be reduced to ignoring your constituents\u2019 wishes if they do not accord with the representative\u2019s enlightened conscience entrusted by providence. Messianic zeal should have no place in a secular society.<br><strong>Steve Simmons</strong><br><em>Camberley, Surrey</em></p> <p>\u2022 The death threats made to Gina Miller are both scandalous and extremely worrying coming so soon after the tragic death of Jo Cox. Such scurrilous comments, bordering on xenophobia, should be refuted by our free press and not encouraged as we have seen from the rightwing press, describing the high court judges who ruled in the article 50 case as \u201cthe enemies of the people\u201d. Upholding the rule of law is at the cornerstone of our democracy and the judges involved have done just that. The true \u201cenemies of the people\u201d are those who rail so provocatively against them.<br><strong>George Longstaff</strong><br><em>Bidford-on-Avon</em></p> <p>\u2022 The argument about whether parliament or the prime minister should trigger article 50 clouds another issue: that article 50 is impossible to use. Under article 50, the other 27 member states can present an ultimatum, since the UK\u2019s membership will automatically cease after two years. Worse, even if a compromise is reached, it has to be approved by the European parliament. If MEPs reject the agreement, the UK will still have to leave. Thus, the 27 cannot credibly commit. The setup imposed by article 50 makes negotiation impossible. Invoking article 50 is close to unconditional surrender before negotiations have begun.</p> <p>Hopefully, parliament will have sense enough to see the futility of negotiating without any leverage and rule out the use of article 50. And hopefully, EU leaders and leaders of other member states will realise that their commitment not to negotiate before article 50 is invoked is not credible. A deal has to be struck, and it is pointless to demand that the UK surrenders all weapons before the fight has even begun.</p> <p>Brexit can mean anything. Just as the British crown has all sorts of arrangements with its various affiliated nations \u2013 the constituent nations of Great Britain, Northern Ireland, crown dependencies, etc \u2013 so can the EU have a variety of arrangements with the UK, possibly with special provisions for Scotland. This needs to be achieved by a treaty change or by some other means, instead of through the unusable article 50.<br><strong>Mikael Sandstr\u00f6m</strong><br><em>Saltsj\u00f6baden, Sweden</em></p> <p>\u2022 Steve Flatley (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/nov/03/moving-forward-from-the-high-courts-article-50-ruling\" title=\"\">Letters</a>, 3 November) suggests, perhaps tongue in cheek, that the government could appeal to the European court if they lose their article 50 case in the supreme court. I can\u2019t see that it\u2019s been pointed out yet that the supreme court must refer the case. The reasoning of the high court in deciding that the crown prerogative cannot be used proceeded from the initial assumption, agreed by the parties to the case as \u201ccommon ground\u201d, that notice of withdrawal under article 50 cannot be revoked. This is a matter of interpretation of article 50, and as the final court of appeal, the supreme court will be obliged to refer the case to the European court of justice under Article 267 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU.<br><strong>Peter Roderick</strong><br><em>Barrister and senior research fellow, Queen Mary, University of London</em></p> <p>\u2022 What a shambles.

  "<p>The government has blocked an attempt to have unpaid internships banned, but is to investigate the practice as part of the current review of modern working practices.</p> <p>Draft legislation put forward by Conservative MP Alec Shelbrooke was designed to ensure that anyone working as an intern would be paid the minimum wage, which depends on the age of the worker. </p> <p>Speaking in parliament he described internships as \u201cthe acceptable face of unpaid labour in modern Britain today\u201d. He added, they \u201cshould have no place in a meritocratic country that aims to work for the many and not the privileged few\u201d. </p> <p>He added that his bill was designed to end \u201ca new rise in the class society that means only those from a wealthy background can gain a privileged leg-up\u201d.</p> <p>However, the bill was talked out by Conservative colleagues. Instead, the business minister, Margot James, said that the government would ask <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/oct/01/theresa-may-hires-former-tony-blair-policy-boss-to-review-workers-rights\">Matthew Taylor to include unpaid internships in his review of employment practices</a>. The former adviser to Tony Blair is investigating the impact of the UK\u2019s growing gig economy on workers\u2019 rights.</p> <p>Speaking about Shelbrooke\u2019s bill, James told MPs: \u201cWhile it\u2019s extremely well-intentioned, I do have concerns that it could have unintended consequences that might even undermine existing employment laws and protections,\u201d she told MPs. She added that if interns met the legal definition of workers in employment law, they were already entitled to the minimum wage.</p> <p>A <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/oct/15/interns-paid-minimum-wage-alan-milburn-jobs\">ban on the use of unpaid internships was recommended two years ago by the government\u2019s social mobility tsar, Alan Milburn</a>, but firms have continued to be able to advertise positions that do not offer a wage. </p> <p>The campaign group Intern Aware said two-thirds of businesses backed a four-week limit on unpaid placements, and just 12% opposed such a cap. </p> <p>Ben Lyons, Intern Aware co-director, said: \u201cIt is positive that the review is going to be looking at this as it is a major issue, which is reducing social mobility and pricing young people out of professions. However, it is disappointing that the government talked out the bill.\u201d </p> <p>Lyons said Shelbrooke\u2019s bill had been \u201ca real opportunity\u201d for the government to back up Theresa May\u2019s pledges to make progress on social mobility. He added: \u201cThere\u2019s a sizeable minority of internships which are unpaid \u2013 we are surprised that more action hasn\u2019t been taken.\u201d</p> <p>Internships are controversial because they are perceived as biased towards the children of well-off professional parents who live in London. They are able to tap into their parents\u2019 contacts to get valuable work experience and can also afford to take unpaid roles. </p> <p>In her speech to the Tory party conference last month, the prime minister said she intended to tackle unfairness and ensure \u201cordinary working-class people\u201d had \u201caccess to the opportunities that are too often the preserve of the privileged few\u201d.</p> <p>Shelbrooke highlighted how some MPs were using unpaid placements. \u201cA quick scan of the [w4mp] website shows roughly 22 MPs advertising for unpaid interns outside of the politics and parliamentary study scheme,\u201d he said. \u201cIt sends a message to businesses across the United Kingdom that exploiting \u2026 young workers is acceptable.\u201d </p> <p>A government spokesperson said: \u201cThe government is committed to building an economy that works for all, not just the privileged few. It\u2019s important that young people have access to employment and work experience regardless of their background.\u201d<em> </em></p>",
  "<p>\u201cThere\u2019s one other person in town with a Clinton sign,\u201d Link Oberg, 30, said, staring across the main street in Downsville, New York, at a phalanx of yard signs promoting Donald Trump\u2019s presidential campaign and Republican John Faso\u2019s congressional re-election campaign. \u201cDid you talk to her?\u201d</p> <p>I am in Downsville, population 633, where the motto is: \u201cThe best town on a dam site!\u201d and where Trump signs dot the well-kept yards. (One Trump supporter, though, inked out the \u201cT\u201d and the \u201cP\u201d on one of the signs, offering neighbors the slogan \u201cRUM: Make America Great Again\u201d. It stood next to a <a href=\"http://www.dailydot.com/unclick/dont-tread-on-me-snake-parodies/\">Gadsden-inspired flag</a> advocating for gun rights.)</p> <p>Oberg, who answered the door in a throwback Army of Darkness T-shirt, grew up in a liberal household. \u201cThe sign was my mother\u2019s idea,\u201d she said of the family\u2019s Clinton-Kaine yard sign, adding she was of the \u201canyone-but-Trump mindset. But no one\u2019s harassed us about it or anything.\u201d</p> <p>Up the road in the town of Walton, Jody Jamieson\u2019s house had signs both for Clinton and for Faso\u2019s opponent, Zephyr Teachout, in the yard of her house on a corner far from main road. \u201cI\u2019m not particularly a Clinton supporter,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I\u2019m voting against Donald Trump.\u201d</p> <p>Two doors down, her neighbors had a Trump-Pence flag where their American flag used to be; on that main road, Delaware Street, a cash-for-gold business proudly displayed the candidate\u2019s signs out front.</p> <p>Jamieson, who is 60, moved to Walton from Oklahoma with her husband, a native of the town who had moved away to attend college, where they\u2019d met. Like Oberg, she said she was one of two Clinton supporters in her town of 5,484 residents. </p> <p>The other is her son.</p> <p>The Clinton yard sign represents something of a shift for Jamieson, who has been a registered Republican for 30 years. \u201cI can no longer identify myself as a member of the Republican party that nominated Donald Trump,\u201d she said. After the election, she plans to change her party registration to Democrat; under New York state law, one must file notice of intent to change parties 25 days before a general election, and it only goes into effect after election day. \u201cIt took Donald Trump to do that.\u201d</p> <p>East of Walton, there are more Democrats in the village of Delhi (pronounced \u201cdell-high\u201d by locals) than some of the other places in Delaware County.

He wouldn\u2019t have agreed to the licences without this,\u201d the source said.</p> <p>The shadow foreign secretary, Emily Thornberry, said: \u201cIt is extremely disturbing to discover the sale of arms for use in Yemen was approved by Vince Cable on the basis of a lie, and it provides yet more evidence that limiting civilian casualties in this conflict has been the least of the government\u2019s concerns.</p> <p>\u201cGiven the MoD have now confirmed they have no control over what the Saudi airstrikes are targeting, any notion that Britain is acting as a restraining force on the coalition forces is plain nonsense.\u201d</p> <p>The sale of British-made arms to Saudi Arabia has been under scrutiny for months because of Riyadh\u2019s role in Yemen\u2019s civil war. The kingdom has led a coalition of Middle Eastern countries to push back against the Houthi militia, now in control of much of the country.<br></p> <p>Saudi Arabia has spearheaded the bombing in Yemen \u2013 raising concerns that UK weapons may have been used in airstrikes that resulted in civilian casualties. Earlier this year, the UN said <a href=\"http://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/N1600299.pdf\">119 coalition attacks</a> had breached international humanitarian law, with many involving \u201cmultiple airstrikes on multiple civilian objects\u201d such as hospitals, schools, factories and homes.</p> <p>With concern about civilian deaths growing last year, Cable suspended the sale of Paveway bombs to the Saudi royal air force. He said he would not approve the licences until the MoD agreed extra safeguards to minimise the risk of UK missiles causing casualties. The suspension caused uproar within the MoD, the Foreign Office and Downing Street.</p> <p>The Guardian has been told David Cameron, then prime minister, called his deputy, Nick Clegg, the leader of the Liberal Democrats, to ask him why Cable was dragging his feet. Michael Fallon, the defence secretary, and Philip Hammond, then foreign secretary, also lobbied for the immediate resumption of sales, according to Whitehall sources.</p> <p>\u201cThe MoD was desperate to get the licences signed,\u201d said one source. \u201cThe Saudis were putting enormous pressure on the government, and this hold-up was extremely embarrassing. They\u2019d already told the Saudis: \u2018This stuff is coming.\u2019 And then it got held up and they couldn\u2019t explain to the Saudis what was going on.\u201d<br></p> <p>Another source added: \u201cThe Saudis are extremely important to us, both as a customer but also in strategic terms in the region. The bottom line is, if we don\u2019t sell these arms to them, someone else will.\u201d<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"be76cb7e7c6329eee4eae61f1e7b841a616d223f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/be76cb7e7c6329eee4eae61f1e7b841a616d223f/0_27_2892_1736/1000.jpg\" alt=\"David Cameron receiving the King Abdullah Decoration One from King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia in 2012.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">David Cameron receiving the King Abdullah Decoration One from King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia in 2012.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stefan Rousseau/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Cable says he was told there were \u201caircraft on the runway\u201d waiting to fly to Saudi Arabia with fresh supplies. In the end, Cable says he agreed to sign the export licences, but only after the MoD had offered to beef up its oversight of Saudi targeting to the levels afforded to the Americans. He said he was told the US had oversight of what Saudi Arabia intended to target, and \u201cfinal say-so\u201d if it saw anything untoward.</p> <p>\u201cMy very clear understanding was that the equipment would be supplied to Saudi Arabia on the very clear basis that British personnel would have oversight of what the Saudi air force was doing, on the same basis as the Americans,\u201d Cable said.</p> <p>The MoD told the Guardian while it had agreed to \u201cincrease oversight of the targeting process\u201d last year, this did not actually involve oversight of targeting at any stage.<br></p> <p>The MoD said its liaison officers \u201care not embedded with the Saudis. [They] do not provide training, they do not provide advice on IHL [international humanitarian law] compliance, and they have no role in the Saudi targeting chain.</p> <p>\u201cBritish personnel are not involved in carrying out strikes, directing or conducting operations in Yemen or selecting targets and are not involved in the Saudi targeting decision-making process.\u201d</p> <p>The MoD refused to say what had actually changed as a result of Cable\u2019s demands. \u201cWe won\u2019t go into details,\u201d said a spokesman. A defence source said it was untrue to say the Americans could effectively veto targets.</p> <p>Anna MacDonald, director of the Control Arms coalition, said it appeared the MoD had \u201ceither pulled the wool over the eyes of the minister, or were themselves extraordinarily naive\u201d.</p> <p>She added: \u201cEither way, these arms deals should not have been approved, and Yemenis are paying the price with their lives.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>The Brexit-supporting press has mounted a vicious assault on the three high court judges who ruled in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/nov/03/parliament-must-trigger-brexit-high-court-rules\" title=\"\">article 50 case</a>. And it has undermined our constitution in the process. The government appears to be fuelling this attack. Sajid Javid, the local government secretary, described the judges as seeking to \u201cthwart the will of the people\u201d.</p> <p>The judiciary is a pillar of our constitution.

They do law. They are selected to be judges on their legal ability. Their political allegiance is irrelevant and plays no part in their selection \u2013 which is not, for example, the case in the US. The judges of the American supreme court, when confronted with the choice of Al Gore or George Bush in the 2000 election, which was contested in the courts, each came down on the side of the party that had nominated them. So Bush won because there were more Republican-nominated judges than Democratic. One of the things that has made the UK such a strong player in the global economy is that politics does not affect the rule of law or the decisions of our courts. This attracts business to the UK, because people know court rulings will not be influenced by politics.</p> <p>The British public continues to have confidence in the independence and quality of judges. But both are undermined by this Brexit-inspired media vitriol. The attitude of the Brexiters seems to be: who cares about constitutional protections such as that which prevents the executive from just removing people\u2019s rights on the prime minister\u2019s say-so, and undermining casually the authority of judges? It is intensely damaging and sets up yet another conflict: judges against the people.</p> <p>We must leave the EU in accordance with the referendum vote. But we must take care not to damage our constitutional framework in the process. Democracy and the rule of law are the two pillars of our constitution.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/04/gina-miller-brexit-victory-triumph-democracy-over-politics\">As Gina Miller\u2019s lawyers, we fought and won a victory for democracy | Emily Nicholson and Katy Colton</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There is very little doubt, when you read this judgment, that the judges have&#xa0;loyally obeyed their judicial oath and decided the case in accordance with&#xa0;the law and the facts. The principle that citizens have legal rights that cannot be taken away on the say-so of the executive without parliamentary authority was not in dispute. The question the judges had to decide was the extent to which rights given by the European Communities Act of 1972 were&#xa0;an exception to that principle. The court concluded unsurprisingly that these rights, which had been incorporated into our domestic law, weren\u2019t an exception, and they cited previous cases stretching back decades, which made that clear. The ruling did not say there should be no Brexit or that Brexit should&#xa0;be&#xa0;delayed, but that Brexit must be done constitutionally not&#xa0;unconstitutionally. As a piece of legal reasoning it is firmly rooted both in accepted principle and decided cases. The decision reaffirms well known principles and applies them to Brexit in an authoritative way.</p> <p>Yet the quality and impartiality of the judgment appears to cut no ice with either the Brexit media or some elements of the government. We trust our judges to uphold the law and the constitution impartially. This impartiality depends on judges not expressing views, so they can\u2019t defend themselves. That\u2019s why the government has an obligation to defend them and why the constitution places a duty on the lord chancellor to do so.</p> <p>The government needs to make it clear that they dissociate themselves from these attacks and come to the defence of the judges. Ministers need to make it clear that they do not doubt for one minute either the integrity of the three judges, or that the judges have given what they believe to be the correct answer.</p> <p>They should make it clear that the judges have in no way acted undemocratically or in opposition to the people, and that attacks on their integrity and attempts to undermine them personally are factually unfounded and undermine our&#xa0;country.</p> <p>There is a world of difference between judicial decisions that have political consequences, as this one does, and decisions that are motivated by wanting a political outcome \u2013 which this one is not. To create a sense that the government is at odds with the judiciary and that judges are somehow in a different political camp from the government is both wrong and damaging.</p> <p>The lord chancellor, Liz Truss, has a constitutional duty to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/nov/04/labour-condemns-newspaper-attacks-on-judges-after-brexit-ruling\" title=\"\">defend the judges</a>. She needs to make it clear immediately that the government has no quarrel with the judges and has total confidence in them. Disagreement with the judges is dealt with by appeal not by abuse. So far Truss has been completely silent, no doubt waiting for guidance from a prime minister who appears so mesmerised by the fear of what the public may do or think that she is willing to throw constitutional propriety overboard.</p> <p>Truss\u2019s silence feeds the sense that the government is either hopeless at avoiding conflict or couldn\u2019t care less about the constitution.</p>",

  "<p>Countries should consider curbing the use of e-cigarettes because there is not enough evidence to show they help people stop smoking, according to a World Health Organisation report.</p> \n<p>Vaping will be on the agenda of a major meeting starting in India on Monday of the 180 countries that have signed the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, aimed at combatting Big Tobacco and preventing the millions of deaths every year around the world caused by smoking.<br></p> \n<p>But the public health community is split over whether e-cigarettes are friend or foe and some are outraged by the WHO\u2019s advice to the meeting. It suggests countries that have not already banned e-cigarettes and other forms of nicotine delivery might want to consider imposing severe restrictions, including banning the flavouring of e-cigarettes as well as sales, advertising and possession by young people. </p> \n<p>Countries might also want to ban nicotine delivery devices from all public places where smoking is not allowed, require health warnings about the chemicals in them, include information on the addictive potential of nicotine and ban any claims that they can help people give up tobacco smoking, the report says.<br></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom element--supporting\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"f344a839-12ce-464f-9080-5182cf0b4642\" data-atom-type=\"explainer\"> \n  <div>\n   <figure class=\"element element-explainer element-atom\" data-display-type=\"flat\"> \n    <h1>Countries that have banned e-cigarettes</h1> \n    <div>\n     <p>As well as bans on tobacco advertising and restrictions on where people can smoke cigarettes, many countries have put in place restrictions on the sale and use of e-cigarettes. A handful of countries have banned e-cigarettes entirely, including Argentina, Brazil, Cambodia, Singapore, the United Arab Emirates, Uruguay, Venezuela, and the Seychelles and many more have instituted restrictions on them, especially on their sale to minors.<br></p>\n    </div> \n   </figure> \n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The WHO suggests these are reasonable measures to control the use of products with effects that are still unknown \u2013 and which are increasingly being manufactured by the multinational tobacco corporations the signatories to the convention are pledged to defeat.</p> \n<p>But for some in the public health community, WHO\u2019s report is a backward step that will hamper the fight to cut tobacco-related deaths.</p> \n<p>Professor John Britton, director of the UK Centre for Tobacco and Alcohol Studies based at Nottingham University, said the WHO report was unbalanced. \u201cThere is nothing saying e-cigarettes are allowing hundreds of thousands of people to stop smoking,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>The convention exists to combat tobacco use, not nicotine use, he said. \u201cIt is perfectly reasonable to be concerned that young people might use e-cigarettes and become addicted. All those arguments apply to licensed nicotine products that anybody can walk into Tesco and buy.\u201d But nicotine regulation is for other agencies, he said.</p> \n<p>Britton is concerned about the \u201cflavour\u201d of the WHO document \u201cwhich is that these products are out there, they are being produced by tobacco companies and we should probably ban them \u2013 or if not, here are some regulations that you might want to introduce.\u201d</p> \n<p><a href=\"http://www.who.int/fctc/cop/en/\">The meeting in Delhi will be a conference of the parties (COP) that have signed the treaty</a>, which includes national governments and the European Union. It takes place every two years to decide the future direction of tobacco control. The WHO report was written at the request of the parties who wanted to know about the scientific evidence for or against nicotine-delivery devices, said Dr Vera Luiza da Costa e Silva, head of the convention secretariat. </p> \n<p>\u201cSo far there is a clear understanding that e-cigarettes should be regulated,\u201d she said. \u201cThey should not be promoted among young people and pregnant women and other specific groups. They should not be promoted widely \u2013 there should be restrictions and regulations.\u201d More monitoring of the effects and possible health benefits is needed, she said.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhile I don\u2019t think COP will close the door [to e-cigarettes], I don\u2019t think COP will open the door to them at this time,\u201d she said.</p> \n<p>The issue splits the public health community. Critics of e-cigarettes are concerned that they may be a \u201cstalking horse\u201d for Big Tobacco, which the Framework Convention has made a pariah. </p> \n<p>Countries that have signed the treaty agree under Article 5.3 that the tobacco industry is beyond the pale and must never be allowed into negotiations. If e-cigarettes can help people stop smoking, the tobacco companies can argue for their rehabilitation and a presence at the table.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhile e-cigarettes offer a significant opportunity to public health, there are also risks. One is the way the tobacco industry uses harm reduction to secure reputational and access possibilities and to split the public health camp,\u201d said Anna Gilmore, professor of public health at the University of Bath and the UK Centre for Tobacco Control Studies.<br></p> \n<p> \u201cThe tobacco industry uses e-cigarettes to claim it is committed to harm reduction, but meanwhile it continues to engage in harm maximisation by spending millions to promote tobacco and oppose any policy that would reduce its use.\u201d</p> \n<p>Ahead of the Delhi meeting, rightwing thinktanks and libertarian groups have been on the attack, arguing that the COP is secretive and not transparent, because members of the public may be excluded from the proceedings. But, says Gilmore, that is because the industry and its representatives have to be kept out of the COP discussion, under Article 5.3, \u201cyet we know the industry infiltrates these meetings often using third parties as a disguise,\u201d said Gilmore. </p> \n<p>It is impossible to screen every individual and group who wants to attend. \u201cThey are caught between a rock and a hard place, because of the industry\u2019s underhand tactics,\u201d she said.</p>",
  "<p>For four days in September 2013, a \u201ctraffic study\u201d closed lanes and caused rush-hour chaos for thousands of commuters trying to navigate the George Washington Bridge, the busiest road crossing in the US. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/04/bridgegate-chris-christie-allies-convicted-new-jersey-closures\">Bridgegate: former Chris Christie allies convicted for New Jersey lane closures</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The gridlock paralysed the New Jersey town of Fort Lee, which sits just across the Hudson from upper Manhattan. </p> <p>The Democratic mayor of Fort Lee, Mark Sokolich, had declined to support the state\u2019s Republican governor, Chris Christie, in his bid for re-election. </p> <p>Three months later, leaked emails appeared to reveal that three senior aides to the governor had plotted to create the traffic chaos as a way to punish Sokolich.</p> <p>Over the past two months in federal court in Newark, the government\u2019s case against two former Christie aides, chief of staff Bridget Kelly and Bill Baroni, a Christie appointee to the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, has painted a fascinating picture of life inside the governor\u2019s administration. </p> <p>On Friday, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/04/bridgegate-chris-christie-allies-convicted-new-jersey-closures\">Kelly and Baroni were found guilty on all charges</a>, the most serious of which carry up to 20 years in prison. Sentencing was scheduled for 21 February.</p> <p>While Christie was never formally identified by prosecutors, the larger-than-life governor cast a long shadow over proceedings which put his claims to have known nothing about the scheme under scrutiny. Here are 10 things we learned from the trial.</p> <h2>1 Political payback is always apt to backfire</h2> <p>New Jersey politics may be brutal and strange, but even here political payback schemes are apt to backfire. The fallout from Bridgegate derailed both Christie\u2019s presidential ambitions and his chances of joining the Trump ticket. With one year left in office, and term limits preventing him from running for re-election, it\u2019s not clear what he will do next. </p> <h2>2 It can also be costly</h2> <p>With the jury verdict in, Bill Baroni, a suave former state senator who was tapped by Christie to be deputy executive director of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, and co-defendant Kelly, the governor\u2019s former deputy chief of staff, could now face up to 20 years in a federal prison. </p> <h2>3 Wally Edge was on to something</h2> <p>David Wildstein, the government\u2019s key witness and the acknowledged architect of the scheme, once wrote a column for a political website about silly, often-petty actions by New Jersey politicians under the pseudonym \u201cWally Edge\u201d. The column now appears to have offered accurate insight into the motivations of the Christie administration. </p> <h2>4 Don\u2019t email, don\u2019t text</h2> <p>\u201cTime for some traffic problems in Fort Lee,\u201d Kelly wrote to Wildstein a month before the plan was carried out. \u201cGot it,\u201d Wildstein responded. In court, Kelly claimed \u201ctraffic problems\u201d meant \u201ctraffic study\u201d. The jury didn\u2019t buy it. </p> <h2>5 Christie\u2019s allies were intensely loyal</h2> <p>US attorney Les Cortes said Kelly\u2019s description of \u201ctraffic problems\u201d meant precisely that. \u201cThey were not about a traffic study,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are a direct view into [the] minds of the participants.\u201d Cortes argued that Baroni and Kelly shared \u201can intense commitment\u201d to the political success of Christie, and \u201cfelt they could use their political positions to execute a malicious scheme to punish a local mayor\u201d. He added: \u201cIt was a cruel and callous scheme.\u201d <br></p> <h2>6 Christie was a slick political seducer</h2> <p>An email by Wildstein produced in court said the Christie administration considered the $8bn-a-year Port Authority a \u201cgoody bag\u201d to distribute favors, money and jobs. Wildstein testified that he was hired be the \u201cbad cop\u201d to push Christie\u2019s agenda. \u201cIf it was good for Christie, then it was good for us,\u201d he said. In court, Mayor Sokolich described the political seduction mounted by Christie and his aides. He was invited to New York Giants games in the governor\u2019s private box at MetLife Stadium, to lunch at the governor\u2019s mansion, on trips to Ground Zero in Manhattan, to holiday parties. Sokolich also described being offered \u201cVIP\u201d seats for Christie\u2019s budget address.</p> <h2>7 TV apologies need to be convincing</h2> <p>As news of an alleged plot and coverup surfaced in early 2014, Christie offered a meandering, 107-minute televised apology, in which he denied any knowledge of the events and pronounced himself \u201cstunned by the abject stupidity\u201d of his aides. </p> <h2>8 The Donald didn\u2019t buy it, and neither do voters</h2> <p>Even Donald Trump, who named Christie head of his transition team in the event of a presidential election win, thinks the governor knew what was going on. \u201cHe knew about it,\u201d the billionaire said at a campaign rally in South Carolina in December 2015. \u201cHe totally knew about it.\u201d According to a new survey from Fairleigh Dickinson University\u2019s PublicMind, meanwhile, just 21% of registered voters in New Jersey approve of Christie\u2019s performance as governor. What\u2019s more, 52% believe there is ample evidence Christie knew about the lane closures.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/11/chris-christie-dealt-blow-plot-far-fetched-sopranos\">New Jersey turns on its tough-guy governor after bridge fiasco threatens his ambitions</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>9 Sopranos references are \u2018a local Jersey thing\u2019</h2> <p>As one Fort Lee resident <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/11/chris-christie-dealt-blow-plot-far-fetched-sopranos\">told the Guardian in 2014</a>: \u201cSure there\u2019s a connection. It\u2019s a local Jersey thing. They\u2019re big guys who talk a lot about respect. You could say the fictional Tony Soprano paved the way for Governor Christie.\u201d Another said: \u201cI would have more respect for him if he had said, \u2018OK. I knew about it. It was a vendetta\u2019. But now he just looks like a liar who doesn\u2019t even have control of his own people.\u2019\u201d</p> <h2>10 This is not the end</h2> <p>Despite the convictions of Baroni and Kelly, the legal drama is unlikely to end here. Judge Susan Wigenton instructed jurors that they could find the two defendants guilty of conspiracy without determining if the pair intentionally wanted to punish Sokolich, an instruction that effectively gutted the defendants\u2019 case, lawyers for Baroni and Kelly claimed before the verdict. They also vowed to appeal. </p>",
  "<p>In Britain we are still assuming that we will not wake up on Wednesday to the news that President-Elect Trump is shortly to be installed in the White House. Or the Trump House as he will call it once it\u2019s been redesigned as a building more appropriate to the 21st century.</p> <p>But of course we said the same about the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/24/britain-votes-for-brexit-eu-referendum-david-cameron\">Brexit referendum</a> in June. There was no way Remain could lose: too much uncertainty; too much financial pain; too much of a step back into a nationalistic world of competing polities. And we were wrong. A majority \u2013 admittedly a slim majority \u2013 let out a howl of anger about a variety of issues and decided to make the EU the whipping boy for their anguish.</p> <p>To hell with economic growth and political stability, we were going to leave.

How could a majority of my fellow citizens have voted to turn the clock back in this way?</p> <p>A young woman on the news summed it up perfectly on that morning. She said she was in a daze, doing the things she normally did, seeing the people she normally saw, but knowing that many of them had voted Leave \u2013 something she saw as anathema. She likened them to \u201czombies\u201d: she thought she knew and understood the people she lived among, but clearly she didn\u2019t.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"92f8bf939463d52b8b6b10cb9edfeb150567f14f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/92f8bf939463d52b8b6b10cb9edfeb150567f14f/0_353_4824_2895/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A chart showing the drop in the pound against the US Dollar in London on June 24, 2016.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A chart showing the drop in the pound against the US Dollar in London on 24 June 2016, the day after the referendum.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Daniel Sorabji/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This was the disbelief phase, and it quickly gave way to anger. How could voters be so dumb? How could they swallow all the Leave lies about giving more money to the NHS? People were never really told what leaving the EU would mean. The fine detail \u2013 the question of \u201chard\u201d v \u201csoft\u201d Brexit, questions about the status of EU citizens already here and British citizens living in the EU, the role of parliament in determining the terms on which we leave \u2013 are only now being discussed.</p> <p>The debate, if it can be called that, in the months leading up to the vote on 23 June was laughably simplistic. An immensely complex decision had been reduced to a binary vote. The referendum was a fiasco and should never have been called. Losing his job as prime minister wasn\u2019t sufficient punishment for David Cameron, who had called the referendum to try to salve wounds in the Conservative party and then led a ham-fisted, directionless campaign to keep us in. He should have been locked up in the Tower of London.</p> <p>But anger only gets you so far. Thinking back to the referendum, one image stuck in my mind. The day before the vote I\u2019d been shopping in a high street close to where I live in south-west London. I\u2019d noticed a young man with a clipboard \u2013 I assumed he was a student at the local university \u2013 walking up and down the street handing out leaflets and badges, and talking to passersby. He was campaigning for Remain. One person trying to do something for the cause he believed in.</p> <p>And I felt guilty, because I had done nothing to try to keep Britain in the EU \u2013 a cause in which I passionately believed. I had assumed my fellow zombies would be too sensible to swallow the Leave nonsense and immigrant-scapegoating and vote to quit the EU. I realised that I \u2013 and all of us Bremainers/Bremoaners \u2013 deserved what I had got. Our arrogance had lost us the referendum.</p> <p>The neighbourhood in which I live had been festooned with Leave posters. The Leavers really wanted this and were prepared to make public their preference. In sporting parlance, they were up for it. The then Ukip leader Nigel Farage said his supporters would \u201ccrawl over broken glass\u201d to get to polling stations to vote to leave the EU, and he was right. Leave may not have had the arguments on their side, but they had all the energy. Remain, who didn\u2019t put up posters or show any passion for their cause, were supine in the face of their rhetoric. \u201cThe best lack all conviction, while the worst are full of passionate intensity.\u201d How right Yeats was.</p> <p>Does all this remind you of anyone? Trump may talk nonsense a lot of the time, but there\u2019s no denying his energy, passion and rhetorical skill. I watched several of the debates involving the Republican hopefuls, and he was incredibly bullish and entertaining. There was no denying he was box office. In an age increasingly suspicious of technocrats, and with people in the \u201csqueezed middle\u201d struggling to stay afloat and looking for simple solutions, Brexit/Trump is an attractive proposition.</p> <p>All of which led me to the phase I\u2019m now at \u2013 believing that I\u2019m as guilty as every other Remainer (except the guy with the clipboard) for the catastrophe of 23 June, and eager to join the battle to rectify the mistake. We had a referendum in 1975 to stay in the forerunner of the EU; we decided to leave in 2016. In my book that makes the referendum score 1-1, and there is still all to play for. I believe (perhaps naively) that once people see the damage leaving would do to the UK economically and politically, sentiment will change.</p> <p>I will do all I can to help shift that sentiment \u2013 writing pro-EU articles, arguing the Remain cause, getting involved in some of the pro-Remain organisations now springing up. We are the insurgents now; we have the passion and the energy. The Leavers are in the ascendant, but defence can be harder than attack if the attackers are determined, as we will have to be.</p> <p>In this third phase, following denial and anger, I have never felt so energised. I have found a cause in which I truly believe \u2013 openness, tolerance, togetherness, economic growth for our common social good. I am even typing this in a T-shirt that displays the 12 stars on a blue background that signify the European Union. I feel I owe it to that student who worked so hard while the rest of us did nothing. He saw the danger of defeat; we arrogantly assumed life would go on as normal. The things that matter in life have to be fought for.</p> <p>So if Trump does win, it\u2019s your fault. Just as I have to recognise that I am partly responsible for Brexit, so you would have to recognise you are responsible for Trump and Trumpism (or is it Trumpery?).</p> <p>And for you, as for me, the only response to that realisation is to change your ways and fight. Unlike Brexit, where us Bremoaners have an outside chance of being able to reverse the decision, or at least to argue for a Brexit so soft that you will barely discern what has changed after our exit from the EU, you would be stuck with Trump for four years (unless you find grounds for impeachment, which might indeed be possible). But you still have to fight.</p> <p>From day one of a Trump presidency, work for the America that is as good as you want it to be. Join campaigning organisations; find (or found!) a political party that reflects your views; get involved in a social group that is working for greater equality and an end to deprivation in your town. You are stuck with Trump, but you can still oppose, negate and eventually destroy Trumpism (assuming the new president doesn\u2019t destroy us all first in his version of the last Trump).</p> <p>Nothing is written in stone, and individuals can make a difference. A train might look as if it\u2019s inevitably running to a destination, but people lay the tracks. We decide the route. The lesson I\u2019ve learned from the past few months is that denial and anger achieve nothing. The only thing that will make a difference \u2013 and make you feel better about the situation \u2013 is to vow that this will not stand. I will fight the reactionary, small-minded thinking that underpins Brexit. You must fight the manifest absurdities of Trumpism. Make America great again in your own way. </p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 7 November 2016.

  "<p>A religious education teacher who posted Islamophobic comments on social media and attended a march organised by the far-right group Britain First has been struck off.</p> <p>Nicholas Hall, who taught at a comprehensive school in Leicester, admitted he had attended a march on one or more occasions, and also admitted posting a number of intolerant messages.</p> <p>Hall admitted a series of other matters, including allowing 12- and 13-year-old pupils to watch an 18-certificate film, accessing pornography on a school laptop, failing to take appropriate action when a pupil acknowledged taking drugs, and working as a security guard while on sick leave.</p> <p>A professional conduct panel concluded that he was guilty of \u201cunacceptable professional conduct\u201d and \u201cconduct which may bring the profession into disrepute\u201d.</p> <p>It also found that he had breached his responsibility not to undermine \u201cfundamental British values, including democracy, the rule of law \u2026 and tolerance of those with different faiths and beliefs\u201d, and that his conduct had violated the rights of pupils.</p> <p>A number of teachers have been suspended or struck off as a consequence of their links with another far-right group, the British National party (BNP). One, Adam Walker, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/jul/21/banned-teacher-adam-walker-british-national-party-leader-nick-griffin-vote-collapses\">subsequently became leader</a> of the party.</p> <p>However, Hall is thought to be the first teacher to be struck off because of his association with Britain First, which was formed three years ago by a number of former BNP members.</p> <p>The professional conduct panel ordered that Hall be banned indefinitely from teaching in any school, sixth-form college or other children\u2019s establishment in England. He has a right of appeal to the high court.</p> <p>Hall, 53, had been teaching at Soar Valley College since 2001. The panel decided there was evidence that he had attended a number of rightwing events and that he had shown \u201cvehement intolerance\u201d towards people of other faiths.</p> <p>Comments he made on social media included \u201cWhat a sick religion Islam is\u201d and \u201cWe will leave them alone when the plague of Islam is [eradicated] from our planet.\u201d</p> <p>In its <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/565392/Hall_Nicholas_web_SoS_decision.pdf\">report</a>, the professional conduct panel said: \u201cThe panel believes that such an attitude is completely incongruous with Mr Hall\u2019s role as a teacher, but particularly his role as an RE teacher of the college.\u201d</p> <p>Furthermore, the panel had seen no sign that Hall felt any remorse for his actions.</p> <p>Following the decision, Hall said he had no comment to make other than that he had \u201cmoved on\u201d since losing his job.</p> <p>Julie Robinson, the principal at Soar Valley College, said: \u201cMr Hall no longer works at the school and has not done so for some time. As soon as we became aware of any concerns regarding conduct, immediate appropriate actions were taken. This included referral to the misconduct panel, which has resulted in the recent outcome.\u201d</p> <p>On Thursday the deputy leader of Britain First, Jayda Fransen, was fined \u00a31,200 and ordered to pay \u00a3720 costs after being convicted of religiously aggravated harassment and wearing a political uniform. This is an offence under <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Order_Act_1936\">1930s legislation</a> that was aimed at the so-called blackshirts of the British Union of Fascists.</p> <p>Luton magistrates court saw CCTV and video clips that showed Fransen and a small number of men marching through Bury Park, an area of the town with a large Muslim population, wearing green jackets and hats bearing the Britain First emblem and carrying white crosses. </p> <p>Fransen could be heard berating a Muslim woman out shopping with her four young children, shouting that Muslim men compelled her to wear a hijab so she would not be raped.</p> <p>Fransen denied the offence, claiming she had not intended her words to be offensive. She attended court with a number of Britain First supporters, some of whom manhandled journalists during the two days that she was on trial. One person was arrested over an alleged assault.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p>",

A 2012 found that Spanish 15-year-olds have 6.5 hours of homework a week, nearly one-and-a-half hours more a week than the average. And children from the ages of three to six in the country are apparently doing half an hour\u2019s homework every day.

She\u2019s also expected to do reading at home nearly every night.

The manuscript shows justifiable pride in her work and control of it \u2013 and carefully hides the hard graft she had gone through to get there.\u201d</p> <p>The Parisian publishing house said that \u201cdue to the technical challenges of reproducing it, to date the manuscript has never before been published\u201d, adding that \u201cBront\u00eb\u2019s elegant handwriting and thoughtful edits showcase the author\u2019s genius and determination\u201d.</p> <p>\u00c9ditions des Saints P\u00e8res co-founder Nicholas Tretiakow hailed the novel as \u201ca compelling gem of English literature, a novel so many of us hold close to our hearts\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWe wanted to rise to the challenge and offer this beautiful and rich manuscript to the public for the very first time,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Tretiakow\u2019s co-founder Jessica Nelson said that the pair were inspired to set up the press after attending an exhibition of manuscripts and first drafts in Paris 10 years ago. \u201cWe were totally moved and astounded by what we saw. We already had a passion for literature but we were astonished,\u201d she said. \u201cNicholas said that in 10 years\u2019 time we would create our own publishing house and specialise in the production of manuscripts, and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve done.\u201d</p> <p>According to Nelson, print runs are limited to 1,000 or 2,000 copies per book, with reproductions aimed at bibliophiles, collectors and those passionate about a particular author. The Jane Eyre copies will be priced at more than \u00a3200, and \u00c9ditions des Saints P\u00e8res plans to follow the novel\u2019s release with further titles in English next year.</p> <p>\u201cThere is a sense in this ever increasingly digital world that the value of handwriting and handwritten craft has never been so precious,\u201d Nelson said. \u201cIt\u2019s another reading experience \u2013 you really feel something very intimate, you create an intimacy with the writer, even a writer who has been gone for centuries. A particular bond is created when you discover a manuscript.\u201d</p> <p>Nelson said she had felt the bond in particular when working on the publisher\u2019s edition of Proust\u2019s A la recherche du temps perdu. \u201cHe had terrible handwriting, and it was really difficult to read him, and when I was first working on the manuscript I was quite angry, because it was so difficult,\u201d she said. \u201cBut after a few weeks I realised I could understand him, and I felt close to him.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Do you eat Nutella by the spoonful? Or just spread it on toast?</p> <p>The answer to that question might seem like an intensely private matter, but it is one that is currently <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/11/02/2016-26407/reference-amount-customarily-consumed-for-flavored-nut-butter-spreads-and-products-that-can-be-used\">being studied by regulators at the US Food and Drug Administration</a>, which is asking consumers how much of the famous Italian nut-cocoa concoction they eat, in an attempt to determine whether Nutella is a \u201cspread\u201d or a \u201ctopping\u201d.</p> <p>The answer could lead to a change in how Nutella is labeled in the US \u2013 which in turn could make it more attractive to calorie-conscious consumers.</p> <p>Ferrero, the multibillion-euro behemoth Italian confectionery company behind Nutella, has launched an effort in Washington to change Nutella\u2019s current designation, which was established in 1993.</p> <p>Under current rules, Nutella is considered a \u201cdessert topping\u201d, along with fruits, syrups, spreads, marshmallow cream, nuts and dairy and non-dairy whipped toppings. Critically for Nutella, the designation, which the FDA said was based on a 1991 consumer survey that showed a \u201csignificant\u201d number of respondents used Nutella as a dessert topping for ice cream, meant that the average serving size was considered to be two tablespoons. </p> <p>The product\u2019s US label lists that this estimated serving size contains 11 grams of fat, or 17% of the daily recommended value, and 200 calories. </p> <p>If Ferrero gets its way, the FDA will soon change Nutella\u2019s designation so that the \u201cnut cocoa-based spread\u201d is regulated in the same way as honey, jams, jellies, fruit butter and molasses. The average portion size for those is one tablespoon. The change would therefore reduce by 50% the amount of fat and calories listed on Nutella\u2019s US nutritional label.</p> <p>The UK, France and Australia, among others, use the one tablespoon as an average serving size.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/oct/31/nutella-fight-los-angeles\">Nutella feud led to shopper punching 78-year-old man, officials say</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Nutella, which is made with sugar, palm oil, hazelnuts and cocoa, has also provided the FDA with its own research suggesting that most people consumed about one tablespoon every time they ate Nutella, and that in about half of those occasions, it was eaten with bread.

  "<p>The silencing of a journalist who is being kept in solitary confinement after exposing corruption in Tehran\u2019s mayor\u2019s office is drawing a huge backlash in Iran and is being widely condemned as shooting the messenger. <br></p> <p>Yashar Soltani, the editor of Memari News, an architecture and urban development website, was arrested on 17 September after publishing a letter that showed the office of Tehran\u2019s mayor had sold or relinquished public land and apartments worth up to \u00a3500m to officials and members of the municipal council under extraordinary discounts and other favourable arrangements. <br></p> <p>Soltani\u2019s arrest came after the mayor of Tehran, Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf, an influential politician with a military background, and Mehdi Chamran, the chair of Tehran\u2019s city council, filed a suit against him. Judiciary officials later said he was arrested for publishing classified documents although <a href=\"https://www.iranhumanrights.org/2016/09/yashar-soltani/\">others have questioned the veracity of the claim</a>, saying that Memari News merely published what had been leaked and that it did not have any secret information. <br></p> <p>Soltani\u2019s detention, however, has brought the issue to the forefront of public consciousness in Iran. Before his arrest, the journalist was only known among the elites, particularly by those following architecture news, but his investigations and subsequent arrest have touched a nerve, prompting huge reactions across Iran. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/sep/27/tehran-iran-bold-architecture\">Tehran's towers: how the Iranian capital embraced bold architecture</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The revelations have embarrassed Ghalibaf, who has presidential ambitions and has put his name on the list as a candidate in the past.

It led to the resignation of a number of senior officials, including the head of the state insurance regulator. <br></p> <p>The public anger at Soltani\u2019s arrest has been such that even a number of MPs, in a rare expression of solidarity with imprisoned journalists, have come to his defence.

Tehran\u2019s prosecutor announced that the journalist, while in jail, had named a member of Tehran\u2019s city council as the whistleblower. Ahmad Hakimipour later confirmed he had leaked the letter to Soltani. <br></p> <p>Reverberations from Soltani\u2019s revelations continued after his arrest. Many beneficiaries complained that they had not done anything illegal and that their names were being tarnished. Last month, a member of the municipal council, Abolfazl Ghena\u2019ati, in widely condemned comments, attacked Soltani, saying: \u201cHis sister should be given to Daesh [Islamic State] for one week so he would understand.\u201d<br></p> <p>Late in October, Iran\u2019s prosecutor general said on state television that 45 individuals had received properties from the mayor\u2019s office under illegal arrangements.

  "<p>A former police superintendent has been jailed for 12 years for sexually abusing vulnerable boys in the 1980s at a Home Office attendance centre for young offenders and at a children\u2019s home.</p> <p> Gordon Anglesea, 79, is the highest-profile offender brought to justice through the <a href=\"http://www.nationalcrimeagency.gov.uk/\">National Crime Agency</a>\u2019s Operation Pallial, which has been investigating allegations of widespread and organised child abuse in north Wales.</p> <p> Anglesea has faced claims for a quarter of a century that he preyed on young boys, and in the mid-90s was awarded \u00a3375,000 in damages after successfully suing news organisations including the Observer that had linked him to abuse.</p> <p> At that time he depicted himself as an old-fashioned north Wales officer who had been inspired by the fictional neighbourhood policeman Dixon of Dock Green.</p> <p> But in victims\u2019 impact statements put before Mold crown court in north Wales on Friday, one victim said: \u201cAnglesea was the worst. He was the man I feared most.\u201d </p> <p> A second said he had several times tried to kill himself because he couldn\u2019t live with the memories of what \u201cthat man\u201d had done to him.</p> <p> Anglesea, a father of five, continued to protest his innocence. His barrister, Tania Griffiths QC, said the<a href=\"http:// https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/oct/21/ex-police-chief-gordon-anglesea-found-guilty-sexually-abusing-boys-1980s \"> verdicts</a> were \u201cperverse\u201d and unsuccessfully applied for her client to be freed on bail while he sought an appeal. </p> <p>Griffiths said Anglesea and his family could lose his police pension and asked the judge to be as \u201chumane\u201d as possible because jail would be so difficult for him. </p> <p>There were cheers from the public gallery as the judge Geraint Walters passed sentence and told Anglesea his victims had been vulnerable young people with nobody to turn to for help. </p> <p>Walters said: \u201cYou do not need me to say that as a person whose obligation it was to uphold the law and protect the vulnerable, your offences against those vulnerable boys grossly abused the trust placed in you. The consequences for them has been profound, indeed life-changing.\u201d</p> <p> Anglesea was <a href=\"http://https//www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/14/gordon-anglesea-allegedly-abused-two-boys-police-attendance-centre-north-wales \">found guilty of indecent assaults</a> on two boys aged 14 and 15. One said he had been assaulted by Anglesea in the shower and a changing room at the attendance centre he ran in Wrexham. Such centres were set up by the Home Office to provide an alternative to custody for youths, and provided physical training and woodwork lessons.</p> <p> The second victim lived at a children\u2019s home called Bryn Estyn in Wrexham. He claimed he was taken from there to various addresses and passed around \u201clike a handbag\u201d to men including Anglesea.</p> <p>North Wales police has apologised for Anglesea\u2019s actions and said it has changed the way it investigates such offences.<br></p> <p>In 1994, Anglesea sued the Observer, Private Eye, the Independent on Sunday and the Welsh broadcaster HTV over allegations connecting him to abuse. During libel hearings at the high court, Anglesea, then in his late 50s and living in a seaside town in north Wales, was portrayed as a stalwart of the community, a Freemason, Rotarian, Methodist and a school governor.</p> <p>The news organisations called evidence from three young men who claimed to have been Anglesea\u2019s victims while they were teenagers at Bryn Estyn. Anglesea persuaded the jury of his innocence and he was awarded damages. The papers and broadcaster were left with a \u00a31m legal bill.</p> <p>One of the libel trial witnesses, Mark Humphries, 30, killed himself two months after giving evidence against Anglesea. </p> <p> In 2012, the National Crime Agency launched Pallial at the height of the swirl of false allegations linking the Tory peer Lord McAlpine to child abuse in the Wrexham area. Its mission was to look at the allegations of sexual abuse within the care system in north Wales that once again surfaced during the scandal, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2014/feb/19/newsnight-lord-mcalpine\">which was triggered by a Newsnight report</a>.</p> <p> More than 300 people made contact with the investigation, dozens have been arrested and scores of complaints are being investigated.</p> <p> It is no surprise that so many people came forward. During the <a href=\"http://www.nickdavies.net/1997/09/17/silence-and-child-abuse-in-north-wales/ \">Sir Ronald Waterhouse inquiry in 1997</a>, almost 300 men and women named 148 abusers including police officers, social workers, local authority executives, senior businessmen and politicians.

  "<p>It\u2019s fashionable to dismiss all politicians as equally disappointing, unprincipled or simply venal. Since the system is gridlocked and out of touch, surely that means they\u2019re all just as bad as each other.</p> <p>But amid the wreckage of the political class, Donald Trump is different \u2013 and not just because of his politics or his rhetoric. He is in a class of his own, taking <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/shortcuts/2016/aug/23/donald-trump-psychopath-hitler\">narcissism and amorality</a> to a whole new level.</p> <p>You don\u2019t need a trove of leaked emails to understand just how different Donald is.

It\u2019s not pretty reading. </p> <p>Trump and his supposedly charitable works are a grotesque distortion of philanthropy, a word whose roots come from the Greek for loving people. Judging from his philanthropy, Trump mostly loves one person, whose name just happens to be Donald.</p> <p>Instead of donating to a foundation with any meaningful purpose, Trump invested in his favorite pastime: inflating his self-image. This is his life\u2019s work, whether it\u2019s the Trump brand of business, politics or charity. The product is the same: an artificial version of Donald Trump.</p> <p>Take the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/02/nyregion/condemned-and-praised-by-trump.html\">1997 story</a> of when he was principal of a Bronx public school for a day. It was a cute program designed to boost struggling schools in New York City, and the supposedly wealthy property developer delighted in the scene.</p> <p>The school chess team was holding a bake sale to raise $5,000 to pay for travel to go to a tournament. Trump handed them a fake million-dollar bill. After making them the butt of his joke, Trump wrote them a real check for just $200.</p> <p>What kind of person mocks the students he is supposed to be helping?</p> <p>A man who shows up uninvited, a year earlier, to the opening of a nursery school for children with HIV/Aids. Trump sat on stage, pretending to be a donor, when he had given nothing. Not a penny. He posed for photos alongside then mayor Rudy Giuliani and the developer who actually donated generously to build the school. Then he simply drove away, having done nothing.</p> <p>That\u2019s Donald Trump. The man whose charitable foundation buys <a href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/painter-reveals-20-000-portrait-purchased-trump-foundation-article-1.2854613\">giant portraits of himself</a> to hang in his own golf resort.</p> <p>The Post called more than 400 charities with some connection to Trump. It found <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjc7ZuJr4_QAhURHGMKHZkGB3wQFggbMAA&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.washingtonpost.com%2Fpolitics%2Ftrump-promised-millions-to-charity-we-found-less-than-10000-over-7-years%2F2016%2F06%2F28%2Fcbab5d1a-37dd-11e6-8f7c-d4c723a2becb_story.html&amp;usg=AFQjCNGH-MaRE_XKgY7kPJ0JO53KEVZKqA&amp;sig2=tcACPSGFjiIRo9n3uXXz8Q\">just one gift</a> from Trump in the past eight years: to the Police Athletic League of New York City, for less than $10,000.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s charity would not matter if he didn\u2019t brag about it so much. The scrutiny began when he skipped a primary debate as part of his petty feud with Fox News, staging a fundraiser for veterans instead. Trump promised to give $1m to the cause, but the money only materialized after months of media questions.</p> <p>For all his boasting about his foundation, most of the money came from outside donors, not from Trump himself.</p> <p>Normally you\u2019d say this kind of man has no shame. It\u2019s true: and that\u2019s exactly how Trump has managed to get to be the Republican nominee for president of the United States of America.</p> <p>Shameless is the way he won the primaries. Where other candidates were mildly restrained in their Muslim-baiting and nativist nightmares, Trump could always take things beyond the extreme. No previously elected official could trash Mexico and demand payment for a border wall. </p> <p>Shameless is the way he has conducted himself as a nominee. He has picked fights with a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/30/donald-trump-muslim-father-khizr-khan-democratic-convention-speech\">Gold Star family</a> and promised to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/10/debate-donald-trump-threatens-to-jail-hillary-clinton\">lock up his political rival</a> without due process. He has praised Russia while attacking his opponent for supposedly jeopardizing national security.</p> <p>And it turns out that a good chunk of Republicans like his shamelessness. They confuse his rule-breaking for the kind of free spirit that will reform a broken system.</p> <p>A real reform candidate could have won this election in a landslide. A self-disciplined extremist could have rallied the disaffected masses to his candidacy.</p> <p>But Trump is no reformer and he has no self-discipline. He abused the tax system to convert corporate losses into personal tax benefits. Then he accused his rival of failing to stop his tax avoidance, when she actually voted to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/01/donald-trump-tax-loophole-hillary-clinton-congress\">close</a> the very loophole that he has exploited.</p> <p>Like the scrutiny of his foundation, the long IRS audits he suffers are entirely of his own making. Trump will no doubt cast such investigations as political revenge, long after this election is over.</p> <p>For now, Trump is like the arch villain of a dozen superhero movies: the more he is attacked, the stronger he gets. The only solution is the kryptonite of election defeat, because with it comes the ultimate public rejection.</p> <p>No matter how much the national polls fluctuate, the state-by-state polls represent a disaster for Trump. States that he needs to win such as Virginia and Pennsylvania are out of reach. States he needs to defend, such as North Carolina, remain in jeopardy. States that Republicans haven\u2019t needed to defend in decades, such as Georgia and Utah, are vulnerable.</p> <p>There is only one refuge left for a man like Donald Trump: the shameless undermining of the democratic process itself. He will challenge the election and its results. He will stir up conspiracies of fraudulent votes and rigged elections. He will delegitimize this country\u2019s political leaders in ways that will make Vladimir Putin very happy.</p> <p>And he will walk away from the disaffected voters who believed his promise that he would win so much they would get bored of winning.</p> <p>Because he\u2019s shameless.</p>",

They have not decided whether to abandon the lawsuit following the apology.</p> <p>Nutt welcomed the apology but criticised the \u201ccommercial interests and ideologues\u201d he said were behind the article. </p> <p>\u201cWe are pleased that the Times has capitulated on this matter, but would have been happier if it had not indulged in this reckless reporting, which smeared the reputations of leading anti-tobacco academics,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cThe battle to reduce the harm from tobacco is gradually being won, but it is being fought against commercial interests and ideologues like those who were behind these articles.\u201d</p> <p>The original stories and a leading article were published on 12 October with the headlines \u201cTobacco giants fund vaping studies\u201d, \u201cScientists wooed in charm offensive\u201d and \u201cSmoke in their eyes\u201d. </p> <p>One of the articles claimed that Cancer Research UK had criticised scientists who \u201caccepted thousands of pounds from tobacco companies to carry out research into e-cigarettes\u201d, and included a panel titled \u201cAcademics making a packet\u201d. </p> <p>As well as Nutt and Bates, it named Profs David Sweanor, Riccardo Polosa and Karl Fagerstr\u00f6m.</p> <p>The online versions of the articles have since been removed and replaced with the apology, which says the five were \u201cinternationally respected for their longstanding global work to reduce smoking and their work on the issue of nicotine harm reduction\u201d.</p> <p>It adds: \u201cOur report and panel \u2018Academics making a packet\u2019 implied that these experts had received funding for research into e-cigarettes. We accept that this was wrong and their work has not been tainted by the influence of tobacco industry funding. We apologise for our errors and omissions, and for the embarrassment caused.\u201d</p> <p>Sweanor, who works at the Centre for Health Law, Policy and Ethics at the University of Ottawa, told the Guardian the group had not yet decided whether to continue with the defamation suit. Despite what he described as lasting damage to his reputation, Sweanor said the main priority was moving on.</p> <p>\u201cThe interest is in simply getting it behind us,\u201d he said. \u201cMy view is that I would just let it go. You just have to move on and do good work, and people forget the bit of character assassination.\u201d</p> <p>The Times declined to comment on the apology.</p>",
  "<p>Scottish ministers have banned police from stopping and searching children for alcohol without legal cause after they found little evidence to support its use.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>To the irritation of some rank and file officers, Michael Matheson, the Scottish justice secretary, said the government would instead focus on introducing <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://news.gov.scot/news/moving-forward-on-stop-and-search\">a new statutory code of practice</a> to cover searches of adults next year.</p> <p>\u201cWe know stop and search can be a valuable tool on combating crime, but it is important that we get the balance right between protecting the public and the rights of individuals,\u201d Matheson said.</p> <p>Scottish police will still have the legal power to require an underage child to hand over alcohol if they can see it on them but, after this new bar on non-statutory searches, would need to arrest them if they refuse to hand it over.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>The decision follows lengthy reviews into the once heavy use of non-statutory stop and searches in Scotland including children younger than 10, which became particularly widespread in Strathclyde under the then <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/aug/27/police-scotland-chief-stephen-house-step-down-early-lamara-bell\">chief constable Sir Stephen House</a>. </p> <p>Unlike in England and Wales, where the practice is heavily regulated, Scottish police were repeatedly using common law powers for \u201cconsensual\u201d searches of children without oversight and legal cause. At its peak, Scotland\u2019s overall stop and search rate was four times higher than in England and Wales.</p> <p>A study by academic researcher Kath Murray, with the <a href=\"http://www.sccjr.ac.uk/\">Scottish Centre for Crime and Justice Research</a>, found under-14s <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/jan/17/police-stop-and-search-scotland\">were searched 26,000 times</a> in 2010 without the specific statutory power to do so. That included 500 searches of children under-10s. In Strathclyde, there were more recorded searches of 16-year-olds than the number of people that age living in the force area, at a rate of 1,406 searches per 1,000 people.</p> <p>The police and the then justice secretary, Kenny MacAskill, insisted that non-statutory stop and searches were an essential weapon in the wider strategy of combating underage drinking and antisocial behaviour. Few children objected and many adults supported it, they said.</p> <p>In 2015, the UN human rights committee said the practice was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/jul/24/un-human-rights-body-criticises-police-stop-search-powers-scotland\">\u201callegedly unlawful and disproportionate\u201d</a> and should be scrapped. But an expert panel set up by Scottish ministers to review all stop and search policies could not agree on whether to do so or not, leading to the latest review.</p> <p>However, the Scottish government\u2019s review, published on Friday, found that after stricter oversight was introduced in the summer of 2015, there were still few successful discoveries of alcohol on children. </p> <p>Of 1,629 consensual searches of children, only 158 \u2013 or less than one search in 10 \u2013 found alcohol. For searches involving adults aged 18 or over, the figure reached 16.3%. There were far more cases \u2013 2,551 in total \u2013 where children voluntarily handed over alcohol without being searched.</p> <p>Matheson said the question of non-statutory search powers of children would be revisited 12 months after a new code of conduct comes into force next year, to see if there was clear evidence the power was needed.</p> <p>Murray said this was a measured and welcome decision by ministers. \u201cAny increase in the powers of the police should be evidence based, and as the Scottish government and Police Scotland have acknowledged, there is currently insufficient evidence to support such a move.\u201d </p> <p>The Scottish Police Federation, which represents rank and file officers, would not comment directly on the government\u2019s decision.

She is already de facto chief of staff, the main spokesman of the administration and a micromanager whose approval is needed for every ministerial interview or policy draft.

I think I was probably just starting to become aware of the lack of democracy at the heart of the EU, and formed the amateur philosophical theory that for the future of humanity \u2013 for prosperity and peace \u2013 you must have democracy. Because if you don\u2019t have democracy,\u201d and he starts to laugh again, \u201cyou always end up with a nutter in charge.\u201d (Does the same apply to businesses? \u201cYes!

It makes me wonder if his Euroscepticism is really another expression of his emotional rebellion against the blue-chip elite.</p> <p>\u201cNo. I know what you\u2019re driving at, but no.\u201d It\u2019s the remainers, he claims, who are motivated by emotion. \u201cSomeone from the Financial Times said I was a great amateur philosopher, which is an insult \u2013 and also probably true.\u201d He hoots with laughter. \u201cAnd I think modern people think because they don\u2019t go to church they\u2019re more sophisticated and don\u2019t have a religion. But I think what the EU became was a quasi-religion for that sector of society. And universities are the modern day seminaries.\u201d</p> <p>Although happy to be a philosopher, he is emphatically not a politician. The last time he voted in a general election was 1992; \u201cI\u2019m not proud of that fact. I just didn\u2019t feel strongly enough.\u201d The only other time he has ever voted was in the 80s, for Margaret Thatcher, because she was his local MP. He mispronounces Andrea Leadsom and Gisela Stuart\u2019s names, and until recently Nigel Farage was the only Ukip politician he had even heard of. Were he American, he would vote for Hillary Clinton, and thinks Donald Trump is a \u201ccomplete egocentric weirdo\u201d, but adds that \u201cI trust the American people to look into it in a bit more detail than me,\u201d so will defer to their judgment next week. \u201cI would never want to be a politician. I know my limitations, and I\u2019m sure politics is more difficult than it looks.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"041e7cba40f974468c68580efeed2439e95d1fd3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/041e7cba40f974468c68580efeed2439e95d1fd3/0_167_4928_2957/1000.jpg\" alt=\"JD Wetherspoon boss Tim Martin being interviewed prior to the EU referendum \u2013 in which he urged his customers to vote leave \u2013 in June.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tim Martin being interviewed prior to the EU referendum \u2013 in which he urged his customers to vote leave.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ben Stansall/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Martin\u2019s indignation this week about EU leaders\u2019 hostility towards Britain did seem politically naive.

He can\u2019t think running the country is like running a pub, can he? \u201cWhat I was saying is that you can\u2019t go into negotiations with the EU insisting upon a particular outcome. If you say your pre-condition is that we have to have free trade, then in order to get that you have to accept what comes with that.\u201d I suggest that I\u2019ll be the EU, and he can be the UK, and he can show me how he would approach the negotiations.</p> <p>\u201cOK, I would say: Decca, I think free trade will suit both our territories better.\u201d I\u2019ll say: fine, but in that case you have to accept free movement of labour. \u201cI\u2019ll say: look, politically, we can\u2019t.\u201d But this is non-negotiable, I\u2019ll say. \u201cThen I think that we have to, er \u2013 well, it\u2019s up to you then, Decca, what you want to do. We\u2019d like to trade with you. You want to trade with us. So what basis would you like to trade on? That\u2019s what I would say.\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019m not sure this would resolve the impasse. Martin is banking on the EU\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/24/eu-firms-higher-tariffs-export-to-uk-than-vice-versa-civitas\">aversion to tariffs</a> to overcome its impulse to impose terms that deter other members from leaving \u2013 and he may be right. But this is a businessman\u2019s assumption; to EU leaders, their political project\u2019s survival may turn out to matter more.</p> <p>We move on to much firmer ground when we abandon Europe and talk about the pub trade. To its admirers, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/jdwetherspoon\">Wetherspoon\u2019s</a> is the saviour of the industry \u2013 while nearly 30 pubs <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/oct/13/the-death-and-life-of-a-great-british-pub\">go out of business every week</a>, Martin\u2019s chain keeps on growing. With nearly 1,000 pubs, it turns over \u00a31.5bn a year, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/12/jd-wetherspoon-sports-direct-zero-hours-contracts\">employs 35,000 staff</a>, and makes Martin, who owns between a quarter and a third of its shares, worth roughly \u00a3250m. But a sign on his office wall reads \u201cOnly the paranoid survive\u201d \u2013 \u201cand I think there\u2019s a lot of truth in that\u201d, he says.</p> <p>Critics accuse the chain of corporate blandness, and he concedes that \u201cthere are instances where the design hasn\u2019t been good enough, and it has given too much of an impression of impersonality or airport lounge. Pubs need individuality.\u201d He spends three days a week visiting his pubs all over the country, and constantly worries about their future. \u201cYou lose a lot without pubs. They\u2019re an important part of the social and cultural life of the country.\u201d But whereas pubs must charge 20% VAT, supermarkets pay \u201cvirtually no VAT on food sales\u201d, allowing them to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/26/supermarket-beer-sales-overtook-pub-sales-first-time-last-year\">subsidise drinks prices</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/03/who-said-it-pub-landlord-al-murray-or-jd-wetherspoon-founder-tim-martin\">Who said it: Pub Landlord Al Murray, or JD Wetherspoon founder Tim Martin?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cBut most of the big companies say nothing about it.

He worries about millennials binge-drinking cheap supermarket spirits at home, instead of learning \u201csocial drinking\u201d in pubs, which have \u201cmore or less become ghettos now for adults.

  "<p>There is a tendency to <a href=\"https://www.princeton.edu/~mwatson/papers/Presidents_Blinder_Watson_Nov2013.pdf\">overendow political events with economic significance</a>. However, the 2016 US presidential election could deliver a tectonic shift in international economic relations.</p> <p>For the most part, the candidates\u2019 platforms are standard, partisan fare. Hillary Clinton argues for investment in education and infrastructure, and a higher minimum wage. Donald Trump, too, advocates infrastructure spending along with tax cuts and the repeal of Barack Obama\u2019s healthcare law.</p> <p>However, one issue simultaneously distinguishes the main contenders from previous nominees while separating one from the other. Since at least 1945, it has been a near article of faith in the west that free trade is an engine of growth. No candidate for either main US party has sought to roll back trade liberalisation. Until now.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/04/us-adds-jobs-october-unemployment-rate-election\">US adds 161,000 new jobs as Americans head to the polls</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Previously in favour of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), a draft of which she once described as <a href=\"http://www.state.gov/secretary/20092013clinton/rm/2012/11/200565.htm\">\u201cthe gold standard in trade agreements\u201d</a>, Hillary Clinton now opposes it. Her reason is that it provides insufficient protection to American workers whose jobs and living standards it might harm.</p> <p>Donald Trump is more strident still, and quite distinctly different from any candidate since 1928. Then, Herbert Hoover won the White House promising farmers that he would <a href=\"http://millercenter.org/president/biography/hoover-campaigns-and-elections\">raise agricultural tariffs to protect them</a>. In 1930, Congress passed the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act, which increased levies on a range of goods, not just farm products. The consequent retaliation of other nations <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/node/12798595\">intensified the Depression-era slump</a> in world trade.</p> <p>On his visits to Pittsburgh, once the crucible of US steel production, <a href=\"http://www.post-gazette.com/local/city/2016/04/14/Trump-says-he-will-revive-Pittsburgh-s-steel-industry/stories/201604140107\">Trump told audiences</a> that the industry\u2019s demise was down to bad trade deals negotiated by incompetent bureaucrats. He promised to conclude good, tough deals and bring back steel. While the likely content of a Trump trade policy is unclear, he has threatened tariffs of <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2016/01/07/donald-trump-says-he-favors-big-tariffs-on-chinese-exports/?_r=0\">45% on China</a> and <a href=\"http://time.com/3923128/donald-trump-announcement-speech/feed\">35% on Mexico</a>. He says <a href=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/favicon.ico\">withdrawing the US from the World Trade Organisation</a> is an option and that he will <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-calls-nafta-a-disaster\">break or renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement</a>.</p> <p>The dogs on the street seem to know that Clinton\u2019s position is an electoral convenience. <a href=\"https://berniesanders.com/press-release/sanders-calls-democratic-party-oppose-trade-deal\">Pushed by Bernie Sanders</a>, she threw TPP overboard in the primaries but will throw it a lifebelt in office, the argument runs. Rhetorically at least, Trump seems set on holing the world trading system below the waterline. If he expects other countries meekly to accept tariff hikes, he will be sorely disappointed.</p> <p>This antipathy to free trade baffles conventionally schooled policymakers who believe, correctly, that it makes us better off on average. While most people win, however, some lose and lose badly. Economists <a href=\"http://economics.mit.edu/files/6613\">David Autor, David Dorn and Gordon Hanson</a> have shown that in parts of the US exposed to competition from China, unemployment has risen, pay has fallen and the number claiming benefits has increased. The winners\u2019 gains are spread thinly and widely. The losers\u2019 losses tend to be deep and are often concentrated in specific areas, around cities such as Pittsburgh. Although the winners could compensate the losers leaving everyone better off, neither in the US nor elsewhere have we found a way to do that. Trade adjustment assistance \u2013 payments to US workers affected by import competition \u2013 has not offset the effects of job losses.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/2016_elections_electoral_college_map.html\">Electoral college maths</a> makes states such as Ohio and Pennsylvania crucial to the outcome of the race. They more than most have lost jobs to import competition. In this context, railing against trade makes sense. Continuing that in office would leave the US, and others, worse off.</p> <p>Even if Clinton wins and, once in office, tacks towards a freer trade position, this issue will not go away. More Americans <a href=\"http://www.people-press.org/2016/05/05/public-uncertain-divided-over-americas-place-in-the-world/\">believe trade lowers wages and costs jobs</a> than the opposite. This is not just an American phenomenon. In <a href=\"http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/01/29/is-europe-on-board-for-a-new-trade-deal-with-the-u-s/feed\">Germany</a>, fewer than two-fifths of people support an EU-US free trade agreement. Among the explanations for the UK\u2019s vote to leave the EU is that the places that voted most for Brexit were those that had <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2016/07/07/the-real-reason-the-u-k-voted-for-brexit-economics-not-identity\">lost most in trade with China</a>.</p> <p>Free trade has been a <a href=\"http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2016/02/pdf/c2.pdf\">source of economic progress</a>. But winning that case in the public square will no longer be achieved though facts, figures and smart debating points. People need to be convinced, through governments\u2019 actions, that trade agreements will be properly enforced and that when jobs are threatened there is genuine compensation for the losers. Fail to do that and we will undermine one of the most effective means of improving living standards.</p> <p><em>Stephen Boyle is chief economist at NatWest</em></p>",

But this time around, despite his vast wealth and playboy lifestyle, our Will Arnett-voiced caped crusader is being painted as a far more sympathetic superhero. It appears a life lived all alone in one\u2019s echoing mansion, eating cordon bleu TV dinners and trying to get all your gadgets to sync properly is a rather lonely one.</p> <p>Hence, The Lego Movie looks like it will focus on Batman\u2019s transition from solo operator to leader of an extended family of masked vigilantes, with Robin and Batgirl also pulling on their costumes for the first time. Sound familiar? Yes, it\u2019s the plot of Batman &amp; Robin all over again, but without the Batnipples and painful script.</p> <h2>Some serious synopsizing of typical Batman mythos has gone down</h2> <p>Barbara Gordon, AKA Batgirl, AKA Oracle, has been through almost as many alternate versions as the dark knight himself over the years. The Lego Batman Movie pitches a new iteration of the superhero who is both Batgirl and Commissioner Gordon, the role usually played by her father James. (The 2007 comic Batman #666, which imagined a future dystopian Gotham, pulled the same trick.)<br><br>Gordon appears to be set on dropping the Gotham City police department\u2019s traditional public opposition to Batman\u2019s activities in favour of working alongside the dark knight. Has she got the hots for the caped crusader? At least, this being a kids\u2019 movie, we can guarantee they\u2019re not about to <a href=\"http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/batman-killing-joke-batgirl-sex-913904\">go all Killing Joke on us.</a> </p> <h2>Michael Cera\u2019s Robin is an eye-poppingly irritating riff on the boy wonder\u2019s reviled status</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"19433db9312730fee861c61a7ea05889128fd819\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/19433db9312730fee861c61a7ea05889128fd819/292_0_1340_804/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lego Batman\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Given Cera <a href=\"http://screenrant.com/actors-hollywood-forgot/?view=all\">often pops up on mean lists of actors who Hollywood forgot about</a>, you might think he\u2019s being rather brave taking on the role that killed Chris O\u2019Donnell\u2019s career.

But The Lego Batman Movie seems to be taking the twisted love-hate thing to a whole new level. Informed that Superman is the dark knight\u2019s true enemy \u2013 a neat Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice reference \u2013 the villain finds himself unexpectedly reduced to tears, his cackling exterior ripped away to reveal the soggy little puppy dog beneath.

Warner Bros might be responsible for having turned the caped crusader into a gun-toting, knuckle-headed bore, but at least the studio knows how to have a joke at its own expense.

Yes, I know the adage that the definition of insanity is doing the same thing repeatedly, while expecting different results. But there\u2019s a cosmic defiance here that I respect. The world may be enraging and absurd \u2013 yet at least someone has the self-respect to keep protesting against that fact.</p> <p>It won\u2019t make them happy, though. These findings illustrate how irritation and complaint are self-reinforcing: objecting to something you can\u2019t control brings a moment of catharsis, but mainly makes things worse, by increasing the attention you bring to the problem, which makes it more intrusive. You end up listening more acutely for the next noise and getting more irritated when it comes. It\u2019s stressful even when there\u2019s no noise, because you\u2019re on edge, waiting for the silence to be broken. No wonder a single complaint becomes hundreds: the complaining is nourishing the problem. This gets easier to see if you think about these minor irritations like a difficulty encountered in a relationship \u2013 in this case, between you and your environment. Railing against them is like falling out with your partner, then continuing, over and over, to pick further fights for the sake of it. And when has <em>that</em> ever helped?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/oct/14/find-fun-least-expect-it-oliver-burkeman\">Find fun where you least expect it | Oliver Burkeman</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As so often, the Buddhists figured this out before most of us. The \u201cfirst noble truth\u201d of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/buddhism\">Buddhism</a> is often translated as \u201clife is suffering\u201d, but that\u2019s a&#xa0;bit melodramatic; it implies constant agony, when for most of us that\u2019s thankfully rare. The word in question, dukkha, means something closer to <a href=\"http://www.leighb.com/bummer.htm\">\u201cunsatisfactoriness\u201d</a>. Life can be wonderful, awful or somewhere in between, but there\u2019s always an undertow of not-quite-right-ness: either what\u2019s happening is unpleasant, or it\u2019s pleasant but you know it must end. The aircraft noise complainer is mired deep in dukkha, unhappy when a plane is passing, and unhappy when one isn\u2019t, because the silence can\u2019t last. <a href=\"http://www.lionsroar.com/the-myth-of-permanence/\">One big Buddhist insight</a> is that this dissatisfaction doesn\u2019t arise from our circumstances themselves, but from the way we try to attain happiness, by lining up our circumstances just right, then keeping them fixed in place for good. It\u2019s a quest that\u2019s doomed to fail, since nothing lasts. Planes come, planes go, and you\u2019re happy to the extent that you don\u2019t mind that fact. Though I think the Buddha did make an exception for that <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5h411OcttA\">\u201cjaunty whistle\u201d Samsung ringtone</a>.

  "<p>The opening scenes of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/36173/matter.of.life.and.death\"><em>A Matter of Life and Death</em></a> are among the most audacious and moving ever confected by the cinematic magicians Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger. After the whump of arrow on target that announces a production by the Archers, we are pitched into the blue-black vasts of space \u2013 the film-makers had consulted <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/arthurcclarke\">Arthur C Clarke</a> about the design of their cosmos \u2013 where a voiceover guides us past eerie nebulae and exploding stars to our own fretful corner of the universe. On Earth it\u2019s the night of 2 May 1945, a thousand-bomber raid has left a German city in flames, and British pilots have turned for home. Fog rolls across the screen, radios crackle with the voices of Hitler and Churchill. \u201cListen,\u201d says the narrator, echoing a line of Caliban\u2019s in <em>The Tempest</em>, \u201clisten to all the noises in the air.\u201d</p> <p>Cut to a red-lit control room, a sinister nest of Anglepoise lamps, and in their midst a young American radio operator named June (played by Kim Hunter) who is trying to speak to the pilot of a damaged Lancaster as it limps across the Channel. The bomber is on fire, its fuselage gaping, ruined instruments rattling around behind Peter Carter (David Niven) as he recites into the ether lines of poetry by Raleigh and Marvell. His crew have all bailed out or been killed; the plane\u2019s undercarriage is gone, and with it any hope of landing safely. Will he jump too? Yes, he tells June; but there\u2019s a catch: \u201cI\u2019ve got no parachute.\u201d The exchange that follows between the Boston-born WAAF and the doomed English airman is absurdly (and knowingly) exalted: \u201cYou\u2019re life, June, and I\u2019m leaving you!\u201d On the film\u2019s release 70 years ago, some critics balked at the cardboard romanticism of the scene. But I\u2019d challenge anyone to stay untouched to its end, watching Peter steady himself for a chuteless fall into the fog.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3451429231a76f6ee8a1c55d88c0bbcfe377e13e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3451429231a76f6ee8a1c55d88c0bbcfe377e13e/0_116_3184_1911/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hunter, as June, looks down from the stairway to Niven, as Peter, who stands by the operating table.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hunter, as June, looks down from the stairway to Niven, as Peter, who stands by the operating table.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ITV/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Miraculously, the young pilot survives, and is washed up on a beach in Devon, where he meets June cycling across the sands. But Peter was meant to die, and the authorities in the next world will not let him go, just because he has fallen in love. So far everything has been in ravishing colour, but suddenly we are in a black-and-white modernist heaven where the first bureaucratic mistake in centuries has set off celestial alarm bells. A heavenly \u201cconductor\u201d \u2013 Marius Goring as a French aristo fop \u2013 is dispatched to retrieve the undead man, but Peter resists, and a trial looms at which he must plead for more time on earth. <em>A Matter of Life and Death</em> is a self-consciously Shakespearean comedy of sorts, and a lurid experiment in cinematic colour and scenography. But it\u2019s also an end-of-war reflection on the living and the dead, including those who have been missing for a time, stranded in between.</p> <p>The film began as an expressly propagandist project. Jack Beddington, head of film at the Ministry of Information, asked Powell and Pressburger over lunch: \u201cCan\u2019t you two fellows think up a good idea to improve Anglo-American relations?\u201d By the time they made \u201c<em>AMOLAD</em>\u201d (as all involved called it), the Kentish director and Hungarian screenwriter had twice exceeded their war-effort brief, with controversial results. <em>The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp</em> \u2013 whose star Roger Livesey returned in <em>A Matter of Life and Death</em> as the neurologist Frank Reeves \u2013 scandalised Churchill with its portrait of a good German and its mockery of a certain English bluster. And in <em>A Canterbury Tale</em>, Powell and Pressburger revelled in a twisted vision of old England at the near-gothic (but again comical) expense of the film\u2019s message about Anglo-American cooperation before D-day.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The plot takes the risk of combining time travel, psychiatric melodrama and supernatural intervention on Earth</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>There were other origins and influences at work. In 1944 the German press reported that a British rear gunner had fallen 18,000ft into a snow drift and survived. Three years earlier, the Times had published posthumously \u201cAn Airman\u2019s Letter to his Mother\u201d: a young man\u2019s fearless and somewhat pompous missive about his willingness to die in battle. Powell made a short film around the text (which was read by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2000/may/23/guardianobituaries.nicholasdejongh\">John Gielgud</a>) but though he greatly admired the core message of the letter, he removed a passage about the war being \u201ca very good thing\u201d, and another about the British empire, \u201cwhere there is a measure of peace, justice and freedom for all\u201d. At the end of the war, troubled by spectres from beyond, the airman of <em>A Matter of Life and Death</em> fears he may be \u201ccracked\u201d. But he has no historical delusions; one of the first things he tells June, from his burning cockpit, is that he is \u201cConservative by instinct, Labour by experience\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"990d7b50989b79a7cee51eab79c4433ae484b4cc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/990d7b50989b79a7cee51eab79c4433ae484b4cc/0_0_3216_2475/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The film\u2019s promotional poster.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"770\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The film\u2019s promotional poster.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ITV/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Pressburger had delivered to Powell a more obviously ghostly script, complete with transparent emissaries from the other side, from which the director tried to excise as many conventional signs of the supernatural as possible: there\u2019s only one instance, for example, of anybody walking through walls. (This is not <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/blithe-spirit\"><em>Blithe Spirit</em></a>, even if both films turn at the end on similar high-speed road accidents.) Powell was determined that both Earth and heaven \u2013 it\u2019s only called that indirectly, in a fleeting cameo by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/richard-attenborough\">Richard Attenborough</a> \u2013 would be solid and consistent, though each is exotic in its way. And though the neurological explanations for Peter\u2019s visitations from the afterlife can seem hokey \u2013 \u201cYou mean ... insanity?\u201d asks a colleague of Reeves\u2019 portentously \u2013 Powell did his best to base the visions and other symptoms on recent medical literature.</p> <p>The plot takes the risk of combining time travel, psychiatric melodrama and divine or supernatural intervention on Earth: all of which themes had recently been explored in other movies, though not yet in the same heady mix. The film recalls aspects of Hitchcock\u2019s <em>Spellbound</em> from the previous year, Ernst Lubitsch\u2019s <em>Heaven Can Wait</em> (1943) and most obviously <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/it-s-a-wonderful-life\">Frank Capra\u2019s <em>It\u2019s a Wonderful Life</em></a>, which was released around the same time as the Archers\u2019 film. Pressburger had already conjured a prototype heaven in his screenplay for Max Oph\u00fcls\u2019s first film, <em>I\u2019d Rather Have Cod Liver Oil</em>. There are reminders also of William Cameron Menzies\u2019 <em>Things to Come</em>, from a decade before: the Archers\u2019 sci-fi heaven is all gleaming white with transparent plastic furniture, and the newly arrived dead receive their angelic wings in cellophane dry-cleaning bags.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jan/23/david-niven-interview-hollywood-1965\">David Niven on the golden days of Hollywood: from the archive, 23 January 1965</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But the most seductive element in the film\u2019s magical relay between heaven and Earth is its treatment of colour. Filming was delayed for months due to shortage of colour film stock and cameras. The Archers\u2019 established wartime cinematographer Erwin Hillier refused to share a credit with Jack Cardiff, the young Technicolor technician Powell hired for the colour sequences, and so the whole movie was given to Cardiff. He had assumed that Earth would be in black and white, the other world in colour \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/the-wizard-of-oz\"><em>The Wizard of Oz</em></a> supplying the model. But Powell and Pressburger wanted the reverse. Their real world is made of golden light, pink roses, blue skies and June\u2019s scarlet lipstick. Heaven is all sparse and pearly monochrome, shot by Cardiff on colour stock without the usual dyes, so that seamless dissolves could be effected between worlds. Its melodramatic opening apart, the film\u2019s most celebrated moment comes when Conductor 71 first appears on Earth, among big blushing rhododendrons, and quips: \u201cOne is starved for Technicolor up there.\u201d</p> <p><em>A Matter of Life and Death</em> was shot on Stage 4 at Denham Studios, where Powell and Pressburger had lately mocked up, with painted flats and blown-up photographs, the interior of Canterbury cathedral for the closing scenes of <em>A Canterbury Tale</em>. Their production designer Alfred Junge was responsible for some of the most dazzling images in the Archers\u2019 work, and this film is replete with exquisite visual inventions. At times these are subtle and sly: the fiery Lancaster that allowed Cardiff to give Niven\u2019s face a sunset glow as he contemplates his end; the heavenly clock that becomes a halo around the head of Kathleen Byron\u2019s empyrean administrator. Junge\u2019s most prodigious contrivance was the 20ft-wide, 106-step, near-silent escalator (nicknamed \u201cEthel\u201d on set) that connected heaven and earth, and gave the film its slightly cowardly US title: <em>Stairway to Heaven</em>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"143e641fb3d319923da51c536f0097c0372cf80c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/143e641fb3d319923da51c536f0097c0372cf80c/0_30_3376_2026/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Stairway to heaven in A Matter of Life and Death.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Stairway to heaven in A Matter of Life and Death.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ITV/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The staircase, with its direct allusion to the motif of Jacob\u2019s ladder in the Bible and <em>The Pilgrim\u2019s Progress</em>, is one of the film\u2019s many literary references. (John Bunyan himself puts in an appearance when Dr Reeves arrives in heaven to defend Peter.) Peter Carter is a poet, and Reeves sees the world like a poet, at least according to June. Reeves, the bearded magus, is the most obvious link to <em>The Tempest</em>. Like Prospero, he is a sort of director, preparing the stage for magical or miraculous events, in the end abjuring his own specialist knowledge so that the lovers may thrive in the last scene. When Reeves first meets Peter, it\u2019s in a stately home requisitioned by the US Army, and the troops are rehearsing a production of <em>A Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream</em> \u2013 many key moments in the film unfold in something like Shakespeare\u2019s magical green world, with the principals framed or shadowed by flowers or ferns.</p> <p>In other worlds, <em>A Matter of Life and Death</em> is blatantly theatrical in places, and prepares the way for the Archers\u2019 more stagey later productions, such as <em>The Red Shoes</em> and <em>Oh ... Rosalinda!!</em> But it is also all about film, its art and artifice. Peter is said to be suffering from \u201ca series of highly organised hallucinations, comparable to an experience of actual life\u201d. It sounds like a definition of cinema. When June calls Reeves a poet, it is because she visits him in a camera obscura at the top of his house, from which \u2013 a bravura bit of special-effects work \u2013 he observes on a concave screen all movement in the village below. And in the film\u2019s most obvious play with the wizardry of cinema, Conductor 71 is able to halt time and speak to Peter alone, turning the action around them into a frozen frame or still.</p> <p>On Friday 1 November 1946, thousands of Londoners crowded into Leicester Square to watch the King and Queen attend the premiere of <em>A Matter of Life and Death</em>, which was also the first Royal Command Film Performance. Critical response was mixed. In the Observer, CA Lejeune complained that the film \u201cleaves us in great doubts whether it is intended to be serious or gay\u201d. Others objected, yet again, to a perceived anti-British strain. In France, the great film theorist Andr\u00e9 Bazin reviewed the film, commended its humour and dismissed its design as so much regrettable \u201cplaster and Plexiglas\u201d. Bazin had missed, behind the metaphysical wit and baroque surface, the true strangeness of Powell and Pressburger\u2019s masterpiece, which is after all a version of the Orpheus myth. Four years later, in <em>Orph\u00e9e</em>, Jean Cocteau would film that tale with radio broadcasts, an undead protagonist and otherworldly tribunal \u2013 but the Archers were there first, expressing with amazing lightness of touch a real yearning to bring the war\u2019s dead back to life.</p> <p><em>\u2022 A Matter of Life and Death</em> is screening at various UK cinemas. <a href=\"http://www.powell-pressburger.org/Events.html\">powell-pressburger.org/Events</a></p>",

Andy Sparrow is off today, so my colleagues and I will be keeping you up to date with all the latest developments in the government\u2019s fight to trigger article 50 by the end of March.</p> <p> Yesterday, Theresa May suffered a massive setback in what was the most important development in the Brexit story since her election as prime minister, after a high court ruled that parliament should legislate on invoking article 50. That means there needs to be a proper bill, passed through the Commons and the Lords, with MPs given a chance to amend it. Up until now, May has refused to give parliament a vote on the terms of Brexit in order to retain as much control as possible.</p> <p> To jog your memory of A-level politics, power in a democratic state such as Britain is conventionally shared by three bodies: the executive, which rules and proposes laws; the legislature, which passes laws; and the judiciary, which determines whether laws are being obeyed. Yesterday\u2019s landmark ruling means MPs and peers have for the first time got a strong chance of shaping the start of the Brexit process.</p> <p> Some key things that you need to know:</p> <ol> <li><strong>The government plans to appeal against the ruling, but informed commentators believe it is likely to lose again.</strong></li> <li><strong> The chances of Brexit being overturned are still minimal, as most MPs and peers who voted to remain accept that the result of the referendum should be honoured. </strong></li> <li><strong> The chances of a soft Brexit have increased significantly. If there is a bill, parliament will have the chance to exercise leverage.</strong></li> <li><strong> There is a real possibility that May will not be able to trigger article 50 before the end of March, as the need to legislate could cause a delay.</strong></li> <li><strong> We are more likely to see an early general election than we were this time yesterday - a vote some commentators have dubbed \u201cthe Brexit election\u201d.<strong><br></strong></strong></li> </ol> <p> Today, the prime minister is due to speak to the European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, and tell him that she is going to press ahead with her plan to trigger article 50 by the end of March.</p> <p>If you\u2019ve seen anything you think we ought to cover, I\u2019ll be reading your comments below the line, or you can reach me on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nadiakhomami\">@nadiakhomami</a>.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/nov/03/ruling-on-brexit-opens-way-to-mps-revolt\">Article 50 ruling leaves Theresa May facing potential MP revolt</a> </p> </aside> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-11-04T09:40:17.352Z\">at 9.40am GMT</time></p>  </div>",

A law passed this year has gutted the bulk of the judiciary. A total of 3,700 judges have been arrested or prosecuted. MPs have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/20/turkish-mps-vote-lifting-immunity-from-prosecution\">lost their immunity from prosecution</a> and <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/29/stop-the-press-turkey-crackdown-journalists-overdrive-since-coup\">press censorship has been imposed</a>.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Meanwhile, the rightwing attack on the British judiciary comes at a time when the role of Britain as an international legal beacon is under pressure. Theresa May in her brief leadership campaign may have shelved plans to remove Britain from the European convention on human rights and introduce a British bill. But the persistence of the attack on the ECHR by ministers has had an impact.<br></p> <p>Equally, the government has removed a reference in the ministerial code to the requirement that ministers comply with international law.

Yet since Friday, Comey has maintained his silence, even as both Clinton and Trump have called for the bureau to disclose more of what it knows. </p> <p>Leaks, however, have continued. Fox News <a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/11/02/fbis-clinton-foundation-investigation-now-very-high-priority-sources-say.html\">reported</a> on Wednesday that the FBI is intensifying an investigation into the Clinton Foundation over allegations \u2013 which both the foundation and the Clinton camp deny \u2013 it traded donations for access to Hillary Clinton when she was secretary of state. The Wall Street Journal <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/secret-recordings-fueled-fbi-feud-in-clinton-probe-1478135518?mod=trending_now_1\">reported</a> that justice department officials considered the allegations <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/secret-recordings-fueled-fbi-feud-in-clinton-probe-1478135518?mod=trending_now_1\">flimsy</a>. </p> <p>The leaks have not exclusively cast aspersions on Clinton. Paul Manafort, Trump\u2019s former campaign manager, is the subject of what is said to be a preliminary FBI inquiry into his <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/fbi-making-inquiry-ex-trump-campaign-manager-s-foreign-ties-n675881\">business dealings in Russia</a>.

The website reported that a former New York field office chief, highly critical of the non-indictment, runs a military charity that has received significant financial donations from Trump. </p> <p>Comey\u2019s decision to tell the public in July that he was effectively dropping the Clinton server issue angered some within the bureau, particularly given the background of tensions with the justice department over the Clinton issue. A significant complication is the appearance of a conflict of interest regarding Loretta Lynch, the attorney general, who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/01/loretta-lynch-bill-clinton-meeting-hillary-email-server-fbi\">met with Bill Clinton</a> this summer ahead of Comey\u2019s announcement, which she acknowledged had \u201ccast a shadow\u201d over the inquiry.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/30/james-comey-fbi-director-hillary-clinton-email\">James Comey: Hillary Clinton email inquiry is FBI chief's latest controversy</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cMany FBI agents were upset at the director, not because he didn\u2019t [recommend to] indict, but they believe he threw the FBI under the bus by taking the heat away from DoJ [Department of Justice],\u201d the former bureau official said. </p> <p>All this has compounded pressure on Comey, with little end in sight. </p> <p>Jim Wedick, who retired from the bureau in 2004 after 35 years, said that if Clinton is elected, she and Comey would probably find a way to work together out of a sense of pragmatism. He recalled both his own occasional clashes with federal prosecutors and Bill Clinton\u2019s uneasy relationship with his choice for FBI director, Louis Freeh.</p> <p>\u201cEach one will find a way to pick at the other.

The city council has said it cannot justify staging the event in times of austerity and is instead directing Brummies to a private \u2013 and pricey \u2013 event. </p> <p>\u201cI think lots of people are angry,\u201d said Margaret Phillips, landlady of the <a href=\"http://www.thebagotarmserdington.co.uk/ \">Bagot Arms pub</a> opposite the park. \u201cFireworks used to be something everyone around here looked forward to. It was really good for local businesses, too. We used to have a really good night in here on Bonfire night.\u201d </p> <p>Communities across the UK are facing the same unwillingness by civic bodies to stage Bonfire night celebrations. Some, like Birmingham, say that when they are making cuts they simply cannot afford it, while others balk at soaring insurance premiums. </p> <p>Other organisations such as Rotary clubs are struggling with the same issues \u2013 plus the thorny old one that it is actually pretty easy to watch an organised firework display for free. </p> <p>One result is that manufacturers of smaller \u201cgarden\u201d fireworks are reporting booming sales \u2013 a worry for fire services, which would prefer Bonfire night events across a city to be contained in as few spaces as possible.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>The decline of Pype Hayes has been a slow-burner. <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-birmingham-15270391bonfire\">In 2011 the city council \u2013 the largest local authority in Europe \u2013 cancelled the bonfire</a>, citing budget cuts, but continued to provide fireworks. There was a popular Disney-themed night and one to mark the 100th anniversary of the start of the first world war.<br></p> <p>Last year the council called off Pype Hayes, but said it intended to find a private partner and would be back this time. No partner has been found and the event is off. </p> <p>Cllr Ian Ward, deputy leader of the council, said: \u201cWell publicised budget cuts mean Birmingham, like most local authorities, is facing significant financial pressures. As a result, we have to find partners to help fund our events \u2013 for example, the annual Frankfurt Christmas market in Birmingham is sponsored by Willmott Dixon.</p> <p>\u201cWe were in talks with a partner about this year\u2019s event, but we were unable to reach an agreement, so sadly the fireworks display at Pype Hayes will not take place this year.\u201d</p> <p>Ann Holtom, a Pype Hayes Lib Dem campaigner (and no fan of the Labour-controlled authority), does not hold back in her criticism. \u201cThis incompetent council is unable to find the money for a popular local event,\u201d she said. \u201cThey say they haven\u2019t been able to find a suitable private sponsor, but how hard have they actually been looking? So much for the council\u2019s negotiating skills. No wonder our city finances are in such a mess.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.birmingham.ac.uk/staff/profiles/history/chinn-carl.aspx \">Carl Chinn,</a> professor of Birmingham community history at the University of Birmingham, said it was a pity that the Pype Hayes display was not taking place.</p> <p>\u201cIt is sad. This was a really important community event that brought people together. These municipal bonfires were brought in so that people could enjoy fireworks safely. But the council\u2019s funding has been drastically cut by central government and they have to find savings.\u201d </p> <p>The council was at pains to warn people that it is against the law to set off their own fireworks in the street \u2013 and suggested a <a href=\"http://www.edgbaston.com/conference-events/fireworks/\">fireworks night at Edgbaston stadium</a> as an alternative to Pype Hayes. But its event is not cheap. A family ticket is \u00a318 and a VIP ticket \u2013 which includes a warm private room with bar, hot dog and chips \u2013 is \u00a316 per person.</p> <p>Pype Hayes fireworks regular Jez Davies, a factory worker and father, was not impressed. \u201cThis was always our event. We had pride in it. I loved coming to Pype Hayes as a child and it was great to bring my kids here. It does seem a shame that a huge city like Birmingham can\u2019t put on fireworks.\u201d </p> <p>Birmingham is by no means the only place where there are disappointed fireworks fans wondering what to do this weekend.</p> <p>Ten thousand people attended <a href=\"https://www.newcastle.gov.uk/news-story/cancellation-fireworks-display-walker-park \">the display in Walker park</a>, Newcastle upon Tyne, last year. This year, for the first time since the start of the century, there will be no display.</p> <p>David Wood, chairman of the Walker ward committee, explained that it cost \u00a312,000 to put the display on, \u00a34,000 of which went on safety. \u201cWe had a shortfall of \u00a33,000 so thought it best to cancel this year.\u201d Wood said commercial partners were still offering money, but less than previous years. \u201cEveryone up here at least is feeling the effects of austerity,\u201d he said. </p> <p>The committee is planning to plough the money saved into CCTV cameras for the park and will try again next year to raise the money for a display. </p> <p>In north Wales, Llandudno town council has had to cancel<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/llandudnofireworks/\"> its annual display</a> at short notice after it was told it would have to pay at least \u00a322,000 to insure the wonderful Victorian pier in case of a fire.</p> <p>Greg Robbins, chairman of the <a href=\"http://www.llandudno.gov.uk/events-fireworks.html\">fireworks sub-committee</a>, said: \u201cWe are very disappointed for the public that this display cannot now go ahead. It has not been possible to find an alternative location. We hope everyone stays safe.\u201d</p> <p>This year Liverpool city council has teamed up with Wirral council on the other side of the Mersey to stage an event called <a href=\"http://www.albertdock.com/river-of-light/\">River of Light</a>, which features music and circus performers as well as fireworks set off from three barges. But it means the loss of two traditional Liverpool fireworks displays in Newsham park and Sefton park.

  "<p>The refusal of the lord chancellor, Liz Truss, to defend three senior judges from \u201cthe vitriol\u201d of sustained media attacks following the Brexit judgment has been condemned by Lord Falconer, who previously held the post.</p> <p>The former Labour cabinet minister asked why Truss, who is also justice secretary, remained silent in the face of personal denunciations in the rightwing, pro-Brexit papers. <br></p> <p>The Daily Mail described the judges \u2013 the lord chief justice, Lord Thomas of Cwmgiedd, the master of the rolls, Sir Terence Etherton, and Lord Justice Sales \u2013 as \u201cenemies of the people\u201d. <br></p> <p>The Daily Telegraph carried front-page pictures of them with the headline: \u201cThe judges versus the people.\u201d Their judgment on Thursday declared that only parliament has the legal power to trigger<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/nov/03/parliament-must-trigger-brexit-high-court-rules\"> article 50, </a> which would initiate Brexit.</p> <p>Writing in the Guardian, Lord Falconer, who was lord chancellor between 2003 and 2007, said: \u201cThe British public continues to have confidence in the independence and quality of judges. But both are undermined by this Brexit-inspired media vitriol.</p> <p>\u201cThe lord chancellor, Liz Truss, has a constitutional duty to defend the judges. She needs to make it clear immediately the government has no quarrel with the judges and has total confidence in them. <br></p> <p>\u201cDisagreement with the judges is dealt with by appeal not by abuse.

  "<p>The publishers of the Sun on Sunday have agreed in the high court to pay an undisclosed sum of damages and costs to a celebrity who fought to keep his name out of a tabloid \u201ckiss\u2019n\u2019tell\u201d following a three-way sexual encounter.</p> <p>The agreement ends months of litigation over attempts by the celebrity, known only as PJS, to block News Group Newspapers (NGN) from revealing his identity. The case ended up being heard by the highest court in the land.<br></p> <p>As part of the agreement, NGN has agreed to remove some articles and not to use, disclose or publish certain information, including details that might lead to the identification of PJS as the claimant in the case, including identifying his partner or three others. </p> <p>PJS is said to have had an extramarital affair with another couple four years ago. The couple approached the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/sun-on-sunday\">Sun on Sunday</a> in January this year and told reporters about the relationship. The paper, which planned to publish the story, contacted PJS\u2019s lawyers, initiating the courtroom dispute.</p> <p>In January, NGN won the first round of litigation when a high court judge refused to impose an injunction. But appeal judges reversed this decision, and the case went to the supreme court. </p> <p>In May, the supreme court ruled that the Sun on Sunday should be barred from revealing PJS\u2019s identity. <br></p> <p>It said the information was private, there was no public interest in its disclosure and, while secrecy and confidentiality may have been compromised by publicity, a court was unlikely to find that PJS\u2019s right to privacy was defeated by that fact. </p> <p>Delivering the court\u2019s judgment by a four-to-one majority, Lord Mance said there was no public interest in naming PJS, and revealing details of the affair would breach the family\u2019s privacy.<br></p> <p>He said: \u201cPublication of the story would infringe privacy rights of PJS, his partner and their children \u2026 There is no public interest, however much it may be of interest to some members of the public, in publishing kiss\u2019n\u2019tell stories or criticisms of private sexual conduct, simply because the persons involved are well-known; and so there is no right to invade privacy by publishing them.</p> <p>\u201cIt is different if the story has some bearing on the performance of a public office or the correction of a misleading public impression cultivated by the person involved. But \u2026 that does not apply here.\u201d</p> <p>Referring to the fact that many of the details had already been published online, Mance said: \u201cIt is true the story has been accessible on the internet and social media but if the injunction were to be lifted, there would be intensive coverage of the story by the Sun on Sunday \u2013 and there is little doubt, by other newspapers \u2013 as well as unrestricted internet and social media coverage, all of which could constitute additional and potentially more enduring invasions of the privacy of PJS, his partner and their children.\u201d </p> <p>At the high court in London on Friday, Mr Justice Warby said PJS and NGN had agreed a final order in the action for breach of confidence and misuse of private information.<br></p> <p>The proceedings were stayed on the basis that NGN pay a specified sum in full and final settlement of PJS\u2019s claim for damages and costs.</p> <p>The judge said: \u201cI accept the undertakings offered by the defendant, which are clear and plainly given on advice. I see no reason not to make an order for payment of the agreed sum. There is no reason not to allow the parties to keep the figure confidential.\u201d</p> <p>Dr Evan Harris, of the campaign group Hacked Off, praised the agreement as a \u201cmassive climbdown\u201d for the Sun on Sunday, adding: \u201cThe real issue here, however, is what would happen to the everyday victims of press intrusion that Hacked Off works with \u2013 the vast majority of press victims, who do not have the deep pockets needed to take on the Murdoch press and other large newspaper groups who would trample over their rights.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ad892f707dcc3a61643944e96f5b7263980ca742\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ad892f707dcc3a61643944e96f5b7263980ca742/0_191_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dr Evan Harris of the Hacked Off campaign\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dr Evan Harris of the Hacked Off campaign.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jonathan Brady/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The privacy lawyer Amber Melville-Brown, of Withers, said: \u201cSometimes an injunction is the only way to go.

And nor should we want to.\u201d</p> <p>Kate Macmillan, a privacy lawyer at Collyer Bristow, said the law had changed over the past decade to protect serious journalism, adding: \u201cThis is about something completely different. It\u2019s about the commercial underpinning of tabloid newspapers.\u201d The supreme court case, she said, had established that there was \u201cno public interest in celebrity sexual tittle-tattle\u201d. </p> <p>But Bob Satchwell, the executive director of the Society of Editors, said the secrecy surrounding the case risked undermining public confidence in open justice.</p> <p>\u201cThe circumstances surrounding this case must leave the public baffled,\u201d he said. \u201cThat does the law and justice system no favours because it undermines public confidence. Open justice is a key principle of any mature democratic society.

It\u2019s fairly clear what\u2019s going to happen from the off, but Staincliffe is a sensitive and humane writer whose talent for characterisation is such that our investment in Naz, Holly, Jeff and the rest of the potentially doomed passengers is the fuel for real suspense.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"2366d734d6f0f0a65fe621ad3238e2df2ded7e25\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2366d734d6f0f0a65fe621ad3238e2df2ded7e25/0_0_333_500/333.jpg\" alt=\"Undertow\" width=\"333\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR Company Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/undertow-448715.html\" title=\"\"><strong>Undertow</strong></a>, a psychological thriller with a nod to Daphne du Maurier\u2019s <em>Rebecca</em>, is the debut novel from Elizabeth Heathcote (Quercus, \u00a312.99). Journalist Carmen, second wife to lawyer Tom and stepmother to his three children, feels uncomfortable around first wife Laura, even though she was not the cause of the break-up and Laura is unfailingly polite. However, this is as nothing compared to Carmen\u2019s discomfiture over Zena, the glamorous woman for whom Tom left Laura, and who subsequently drowned off the Norfolk coast. When chance remarks lead Carmen to suspect that Zena\u2019s death was not, after all, an accident, she starts to investigate, and&#xa0;begins to worry that Tom might have been responsible. A strong sense of place, deft plotting and moments of&#xa0;genuine surprise make up for a lack of emotional depth and some unconvincingly summarised scenes.</p>",

  "<h2>1) Jimmy Connors, 1991 US Open</h2> <p>The eight-times grand slam winner had already caused a stir at Flushing Meadows before his fourth-round match with the top-10 ranked Aaron Krickstein. That an ageing Connors had gone so far as a wildcard was a truly remarkable feat in itself. He was the world No 174 going into the tournament; a brief cameo was about as much as anyone expected.</p> <p>But it is testament to his fighting spirit and no little skill that Connors was able to knock over a collection of talented young opponents on his way to what would be a titanic tussle with Krickstein on Stadium Court on his 39th birthday. Having lost the first set, Connors fed off the support of the vociferous Labor Day crowd to mount a fightback in the second, forcing a tie-break and flooding his veins with Incredible Hulk levels of testosterone.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/21/my-favourite-game-venus-williams-v-lindsay-davenport-2005-wimbledon-final\">My favourite game: Venus Williams v Lindsay Davenport, 2005 Wimbledon final | Tumaini Carayol</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It was here that a bad call led to him blowing his top in spectacular style. \u201cHe called the ball good, you didn\u2019t see the God darn ball,\u201d yells Connors, having scurried towards the umpire David Littlefield\u2019s chair like an irate Yorkshire terrier. \u201cIt was clearly out,\u201d counters Littlefield. \u201cClearly bull crap! Bull crap!\u201d is Connors\u2019 reply, his worst volley of the day by a country mile.</p> <p>It soon became clear that Connors had perhaps gotten a little carried away with his own underdog story. \u201cI\u2019m out here playing my butt off at 39 years old and you\u2019re doing that! Get your ass out the chair! Get your ass out of the chair! You\u2019re a bum! You\u2019re a bum!\u201d Remarkably, Connors wasn\u2019t sanctioned for the abuse, which included Littlefield being called an \u201cabortion\u201d among other things. The reason? The umpire chose not to report him.</p> <p>Connors was well known for putting pressure on umpires and was often accused of bullying \u2013 perhaps here his tough-guy image helped him avoid a fine or worse. He kept up his bullish Captain America antics, going on to beat Krickstein in five sets, having trailed 5-2 in the last. \u201cHappy birthday to you,\u201d sang the crowd on Stadium Court. Perhaps that\u2019s all Connors wanted \u2013 a bit of credit for flying the flag for middle-aged men.</p> <p>He was finally made to look his age by Jim Courier, 18 years his junior, in the semi-finals, being beaten in straight sets.

And at Wimbledon in 1995 he proved it as both provokee and provocateur, turning humdrum into historic amid the kind of scenes that no one wants to see, that everyone with a soul is desperate to see.</p> <p>In the first round of the doubles he and his partner, Henrik Holm, were two sets to one down against the local favourites Tim Henman and Jeremy Bates. Playing a third-set tie-break, Henman became upset after losing a point to a net-cord, so belted a loose ball only to crack a 16-year-old ball-girl in the side of the head. Down she went, crying. Naturally, Tim was tigerish in his compassion. \u201cThere\u2019s hard and very hard,\u201d he told the umpire, \u201cand I hit the ball hard. It wasn\u2019t as if I bulleted it, and she\u2019s standing there and she runs straight across in front of me.\u201d People doing their jobs without regard for the childish petulance of others; disgusting.</p> <p>Tarango, meanwhile, smelled the sweet scent of opportunity. \u201cWith the speed of the ball, it could have killed the girl,\u201d he piously observed, as the tournament referee appeared on the scene. Amazingly, even Henman\u2019s display of first-name terms could not save him, and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK0m6UPWmh0\">Alan Mills duly defaulted him</a>. It was a desecration of everything that Wimbledon represents.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2007/jun/30/tennis.wimbledon9\">Wimbledon 2007: The day Tarango walked</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A few days later, Tarango played Alexander Mronz in the third round of the singles. Finding himself 6-7, 1-2 and break-point down, he was denied an ace when a line judge called a fault \u2013 only for the umpire to overrule and declare a let. This was ill-received. \u201cNo, that was an ace,\u201d he insisted. It was not, said the umpire. \u201cNo, it was an ace.\u201d It was not, said the umpire. \u201cNonononononono, I\u2019ve seen it on TV a million times, that was an ace.\u201d</p> <p>At this point, the most passionate and knowledgeable crowd in all of sport was forced to intervene. Its legendary sense of fair play had been mortally wounded by Tarango\u2019s intervention earlier in the week so, cognisant of the opportunity to incite some serious entertainment, it began to heckle with shouting, laughter and ilk. \u201cOh shut-up\u201d was Tarango\u2019s tame response, prompting Bruno Rebeuh, the umpire, to demand some attention of his own. \u201cCode violation,\u201d he announced. \u201cAudible obscenity, Mr Tarango.\u201d</p> <p>As the crowd cheered further, Tarango approached the chair. \u201cHow is that an audible obscenity,\u201d he queried, with good reason. \u201cWell how come they can say whatever they want to me?\u201d he continued with teenage logic. After which he reverted to call centre tactics. \u201cCan you call a supervisor please?\u201d he asked Rebeuh. \u201cI have a big beef.\u201d</p> <p>Rebeuh was reluctant, but Tarango was robust. \u201cNo no no, I\u2019m not playing any more,\u201d he said. So out came Stefan Fransson, who told Tarango to get on with it. So Tarango got on with it. \u201cYou are the most corrupt official in the game and you can\u2019t do that!\u201d he told Rebeuh, earning another code violation for verbal abuse, this time with a point penalty. The game was gone and so, probably, was the set. \u201cThat\u2019s it. No way! That\u2019s it!\u201d he ranted to increasing mirth, slamming down the balls in his hand and making the finished gesture. He then grabbed his bag and stalked off court, the first person so to do in 109 years of Wimbledon history.</p> <p>Rebueh, of course, snared the last word, defaulting Tarango who, by the press conference, was calm and focused. There, he explained a conspiracy whereby Rebeuh favoured certain players in return for the gift of their friendship, information gleaned from two women Rebeuh had tried to pick up at a party.</p> <p>Tarango did, though, admit regret at stomping off, before hinting at something more elemental. \u201cI don\u2019t feel that I should be pushed around for my whole life and let people take advantage of me,\u201d he said. \u201cI just felt that I was backed into a corner and that I had no recourse for defending myself.\u201d Mrs Tarango did not bother with such prevarication, simply slapping Rebeuh across the face, twice. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s bad,\u201d she said. \u201cI think it\u2019s good, because this guy deserves a lesson at some point. He can do whatever he wants because he\u2019s in the chair.

This forced her to remonstrate with the offending line judge. \u201cI swear to God I\u2019ll fucking take the ball and shove it down your fucking throat,\u201d she offered.

You\u2019re ugly on the inside.\u201d Ouch.</p> <p>And that was not it, either; barely had Asderaki time to ponder these profound existential issues before Williams was at her again. \u201cWe were in America last time I checked,\u201d she said at changeover. \u201cDon\u2019t look at me. If we\u2019re ever walking down the street, stay on the other side. You\u2019re totally out of control. You\u2019re a hater and you\u2019re unattractive inside.

No one, that\u2019s who. It never happened. But it almost did. The first Polish man to reach the last four of a grand slam event, Janowicz won the first set on a tie-break in his semi-final against Andy Murray, dropped the second and led by a break midway through the third. Denting Murray\u2019s armour with his huge serves, and mixing up his power play by throwing in the odd drop shot here and there, he looked in control of the match.</p> <p>But if anyone had reached that conclusion as the light over Centre Court gradually faded, they hadn\u2019t reckoned with Murray\u2019s relish for a stirring comeback. It arrived, inevitably and the Scot swept into the final in typically obdurate style, although not without the controversy of a disagreement about the roof at the end of the third set. Janowicz wanted it on and argued his case vociferously, saying that he was struggling to see the ball as darkness fell, while Murray wanted to maintain his momentum. The Pole won that battle, but lost the match, and he did not endear himself to the crowd with some of his antics, that deep frown of his lending him a menacing air.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/jan/16/australian-open-jerzy-janowicz-nuts\">Australian Open 2013: Jerzy Janowicz admits he 'went nuts' at umpire</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Janowicz was an emotional presence on and off court in those days, weeping with joy during a live television interview after reaching the final of the Paris Masters in 2012, attracting derision when he delivered a petulant underarm serve during a match at the US Open. His most memorable outburst, however, came at the Australian Open in 2013 and it was a classic of the genre, a hot blast of steam brought on by a tight line call going against him during a tense tie-break with Somdev Devvarman. Enraged when Devvarman saved a set point with a winner that looked out, Janowicz let rip, making a name for himself with the sheer showmanship of his tantrum. \u201cHow many times?\u201d he roared. \u201cHow many times?\u201d</p> <p>Briefly it seemed that he was about to grab a microphone and launch into a power ballad, which probably would have been preferable to what happened next, as he gobbed in the general vicinity of where Devvarman\u2019s shot had landed. Offputting though spitting is, it was difficult not to see the funny side of the melodrama and utter ludicrousness of Janowicz taking out his frustration on an inanimate object that way. If a branch had been close by, it sends a shudder down the spine to think of the thrashing the blue concrete <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mv0onXhyLlE\">would have received</a>.</p> <p>Janowicz lost the tie-break, a development he accepted in predictably good humour. He hit the umpire\u2019s chair and tossed a water bottle across the court. Although he fought back to win the match, he was fined \u00a31,576 for his behaviour. \u201cI went nuts,\u201d Janowicz said.</p> <p>Later that year, he appeared to be on the verge of making headlines of a rather more positive nature after pushing Murray hard at Wimbledon. But when he met Djokovic in the US Open last month, it was in the first round instead of the latter stages. Injuries have caused the 25-year-old\u2019s ranking to tumble and Janowicz is in danger of becoming one of tennis\u2019s forgotten men, in danger of being remembered more for the time he spat the dummy out than for anything he has achieved with a racquet. <strong>JS</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hfTDuISM4U\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/7hfTDuISM4U?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <h2>5) Andre Agassi, US Open 1990</h2> <p>When Andre Agassi declared \u201cimage is everything\u201d in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E78OnfyQiWo\">a 1991 Canon Rebel camera advert</a> \u2013 in which he spent most of his time running his hands through his mullet while driving a Jeep and spinning his racket on his finger against the backdrop of a mountain range \u2013 it wasn\u2019t necessarily unusual for AA MK 1, though the timing certainly was.</p> <p>At 21 years old, Agassi was among the best-paid players in the game, but had yet to win a grand slam \u2013 in fact he had just lost three finals on the bounce and had refused to appear at Wimbledon for the third year running because of the dress code \u2013 so this was perhaps an odd time for another declaration of style over substance. Agassi\u2019s slogan and the advert were also odd for featuring almost the exact outfit \u2013 cropped lime, black and white shirt, matching headband, gold jewellery \u2013 that he had worn not a year earlier at the US Open, in which he spat and cursed at an umpire.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/may/02/andre-agassi-interview\">Q&amp;A: Andre Agassi</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In his second-round match against Petr Korda, and in front of a live TV audience, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x298JDtqDpE\">Agassi lost it</a>. After a shot of his was called out, tennis\u2019s biggest star marched towards the umpire Wayne McKewen and impolitely asked: \u201cAre you bullshitting me?\u201d before turning on his heels with an ill-timed \u201cfuck!\u201d as he retreated back to the baseline. A code of court violation was issued by McKewan, causing Agassi to repeat his journey to the chair, this time wailing at point-blank range with all the protestation of a young boy that knows he in the wrong: \u201cI didn\u2019t say anything! I didn\u2019t say anything \u2026 you son of a bitch!\u201d</p> <p>Agassi was lucky that McKewan somehow didn\u2019t hear this last self-defeating utterance but at the next changeover, on his way to his own chair, Agassi spat, with his saliva landing on McKewan\u2019s leg and foot. Immediately the umpire called tournament director Ken Farrar out on to court. \u201cSpit on you? No. It was an accident, really,\u201d explained Agassi. \u201cHere, do you need a towel?\u201d Farrar gave Agassi the benefit of the doubt and issued no penalty but later saw the condemning footage that changed his mind. \u201cI made the mistake of not being out on court, because when I went out, the situation was very serious and I was flying a little bit blind. I gave the player the benefit of the doubt because I hadn\u2019t seen what had happened. After I saw the tape, I realised I shouldn\u2019t have done that. It\u2019s clear from the tape that he spit in McKewen\u2019s direction.\u201d</p> <p>Agassi went on to win in four sets but received a fine of $500 for his swearing and $2,500 for the spitting. After victory in his next match, he appeared unrepentent: \u201cThe whole thing wouldn\u2019t have happened if the umpire had been doing his job.\u201d <strong>MB</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x298JDtqDpE\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/x298JDtqDpE?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <h2>6) Andy Roddick, Australian Open 2008</h2> <p>There was, indeed there still is, a lot to like about Andy Roddick. He is a fabulous pundit these days, sharp of tongue, quick witted and insightful. When he first broke through in 2003, with all the impish recklessness of Steve Stifler, he instantly became the darling of the media, becoming the youngest American No 1 since records began after 140mph-serving his way to the US Open in 2003.</p> <p>But by 2008, the wheels had started to come off: still marooned on one grand slam title, 2007 had been an injury-blighted year and at the beginning of the next at the Australian Open, public opinion soured when he not only made personal insults against an official, but undermined the entire umpiring profession.</p> <p>It had been a frustrating night for Roddick. By the end of it, the sixth seed would depart the Rod Laver Arena after 2am, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THHsROPZs44\">defeated by the 29th seed Philipp Kohlschreiber</a> despite serving a then career-best 42 aces. The umpire Emmanuel Joseph bore the brunt of it, and after an overturned out call, Roddick let rip with all the explosiveness of a forehand. \u201cYou\u2019re an idiot. You\u2019re lying to yourself. Seriously, do you have to be like a second-grade dropout to be an umpire? Did you go to school until you were eight years old? I think you quit school before you were 10.\u201d Then he addressed the jeering crowd, shouting at the top of his lungs: \u201cStay in school kids or you\u2019ll end up being an umpire!\u201d <strong>JS</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THHsROPZs44\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/THHsROPZs44?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>",

Australia batted serenely under blue skies on a flat pitch for the opening hour and looked set to amass a match-winning total. Barely a session later they were all out for a lead of just two runs. A further session passed and they were over 100 runs in arrears.</p> <p>It was a phenomenal achievement from South Africa, especially considering their spearhead Dale Steyn was ruled out of the series after injuring his troublesome shoulder in the morning session. In his absence Vernon Philander, Kagiso Rabada and in particular Keshav Maharaj bowled exceptionally. Maharaj\u2019s control on debut in unfamiliar conditions against aggressive opponents marks him out as a bowler of great promise. </p> <p>The Proteas made a better fist of things with the bat when asked to take guard a second time, losing Stephen Cook and Hashim Amla in 40 otherwise untroubled overs before the close. It should be the foundation for an imposing lead with the pitch remaining true and the dangerous Mitchell Starc looking short of a gallop. </p> <p>With the mercury tipped to read nearly 40C on Saturday, South Africa could make a serious statement for the series.</p> <p>Thanks for sticking with us, we\u2019ll be back to do it all again tomorrow.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f0cf30e02be616258c8e883a668df07d688d5e0b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f0cf30e02be616258c8e883a668df07d688d5e0b/0_0_3332_2172/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mitchell Starc toiled on day two of the first Test but he will need to produce something special on day three if Australia are to defeat South Africa.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"652\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mitchell Starc toiled on day two of the first Test but he will need to produce something special on day three if Australia are to beat South Africa.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dave Hunt/AAP</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-11-04T10:40:12.905Z\">at 10.40am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-581c5bf9e4b07ceadb3a261b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-04T10:02:47.396Z\">10.02am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>40th over: South Africa 104-2 (Elgar 46, Duminy 34) lead by 102</strong></p> <p>Lyon to bowl the final over of the day to Dean Elgar.

Eighteen tests into it and he averages 24 with the the bat (good for a number 8), and 36 with the ball (good for a part-timer). The perfect all rounder would make the team with either skill, a good one with one or the other. But Marsh would make the team on neither. He\u2019s making me miss Shane Watson, and that can\u2019t be good.\u201d</p> <p>I think you\u2019ll find plenty of agreement Peter. Playing devil\u2019s advocate, Marsh is clearly prodigiously talented and at 25 he has time on his side. Plus, alternative all-rounders are hardly knocking the door down to be selected. In the modern era, can a four man attack be justified?

With Australia 156-0 at drinks, they had gotten through a rugged mini-session to begin against the experienced Proteas\u2019 pair Steyn and Philander, it looking a lock for Warner to notch a ton and Marsh to maybe follow suit. </p> <p>Instead? The hosts lost 4-for-25 in that second hour to legitimately open the door to the tourists finding a first innings lead. And all that without their spearhead Steyn, who has, according to South African team management here at the ground, \u201caggravated an old injury\u201d when leaving the field reaching for his right shoulder, since going to hospital for scans. </p> <p>The collapse began with Warner, who two balls after drinks guided Philander into the hands of Amla at first slip for 97. It was a brilliant hand for the most part, but he was gutted with the dismissal. Albeit one that Philander had very much earned after beating his bat more than once early on. </p> <p>Khawaja (6) came and went in the space of a couple of overs, beaten by a Rabada inducker from around the wicket that took his off stump out of the ground. Too quick, too good. Next was Smith (0), with the most controversial of those to fall in the match so far, Aleem Dar adjudging him lbw after dancing so far down the track he was in position to shake hands with the bowler Majarah. Alas, DRS confirmed that despite the journey he had made down the track the ball was going on to clip leg stump. What scenes, the young left arm spinner earning his first Test scalp in the process. </p> <p>And finally, Marsh (63) in the moments leading to lunch fell in similar fashion to Khawaja, Philander getting plenty of movement back into the left hander from around the wicket, a relatively easy leg before decision for Umpire Nigel Llong, Marsh not saved by DRS. It was a resilient innings from the local, surviving plenty, but he\u2019ll ultimately be disappointed to depart right when he did. </p> <p>Righto, that\u2019ll be it for me. A fantastic Test match shaping up here, especially if South Africa can find a way to get through Australia\u2019s vulnerable lower-middle order and get into the bowlers. It\u2019ll be JP Howcroft with you after the breather. Enjoy the rest of the day. I certainly will be.

He went on to basically throw it back to the on-field officials to make these judgments:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cOn-field banter is something that has always been part of the game but when that banter turns to abuse that crosses the line to something different.

This includes images, text, video, a combination of all three and sometimes real-world actions.</p> <p>Political memes have always existed. Recall Ronald Reagan\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2013/12/20/255819681/the-truth-behind-the-lies-of-the-original-welfare-queen\">Welfare Queen</a> or Howard Dean\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6i-gYRAwM0\">euphoric howl</a>.

They are now born from the swamps of the internet in real time, distributed from the bottom up. They have grown into a form of anarchic folk propaganda, ranging from tolerable epigrams to glittering hate-soaked image macros akin to a million little rogue Pravdas.</p> <p>Like me, you probably have more than a few Facebook friends who make it their life\u2019s work to circulate political memes in hopes of influencing how you see the world. They are our deadbeat uncles, former co-workers and long-forgotten high school acquaintances. They are agents of nowhere, apparatchiks of nothing in particular. And through the raw power of mass replication, even their most insipid ideas are able to surface from below. By typing some text on an image and sharing it with friends, they too have a voice capable of reaching a critical mass.</p> <p>The reason why it is now possible for Darryl from Accounting who hates \u201csocial justice warriors\u201d to have the same communicative power as a television network is down to the DNA of the medium: speed and lack of gatekeepers.

We created memes, but not just any memes \u2013 political ones meant to trigger paradigm shifts that would upend the prevailing logic of late capitalism, such as this one:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"533ea821b0ebaa4fe609b20102e9319c4f565c09\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/533ea821b0ebaa4fe609b20102e9319c4f565c09/0_0_915_1232/743.jpg\" alt=\"Adbusters memes\" width=\"743\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>We called it \u201cmeme warfare\u201d, a term that was originally coined by social change activist Andrew Boyd. </p> <p>\u201cSocial movements cannot live by meme alone. Yet memes are clearly powerful \u2013both analytically and operationally,\u201d Boyd wrote in his essay <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://andrewboyd.com/truth-is-a-virus-meme-warfare-and-the-billionaires-for-bush-or-gore/\">Truth is a Virus: Meme warfare and the billionaires for Bush (or Gore)</a>. \u201cA vital movement requires a hot and happening meme. Truth is a virus whose aim is to subvert the corporate mememachine with a sly guerrilla war of signs.\u201d</p> <p>Much of what we produced was mischievous, maybe even poignant, much of it verged on self-satire but most of it was strictly for the LOLs; in-jokes to keep the blood pumping through those long and sedentary pizza-filled production nights. But every once in a while, the Adbusters office turned out something that proved to be profoundly effective. </p> <p>For instance, the <a href=\"http://pismowidok.org/index.php/one/article/viewFile/162/290/2088\">black and white image</a> of a ballerina gracefully perched atop the charging bull of Wall Street, while masked figures charged forward from the background. \u201cBring tent\u201d, it read underneath, alongside the now famous hashtag that sparked the Occupy movement.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"10b6ba602941927fee2355ac206af8148fac3b90\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/10b6ba602941927fee2355ac206af8148fac3b90/0_0_1000_1515/660.jpg\" alt=\"Adbusters meme\" width=\"660\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Back in 2010, the idea of using memes to political ends was still housed within a fairly slim leftist-activist corridor \u2013 it was a tool that seemed entirely of our own creation, and entirely under our control. We viewed memes as a vehicle through which activists could speak truth to power \u2013 they were molotov Jpegs to be thrown at corporate hegemony\u2019s bulletproof limousine.</p> <p>Never in our most ironic dreams did we the think that the spirit of our tired, lager-fueled pisstakes would end up leading to a resurgence of white nationalism and make the prospect of a fascist America faintly realistic.</p> <p>But the internet is weird like that. It takes things and twists them.</p> <p>At their most basic, meme warfare presented an opportunity for individuals to seize control of the means of media production from corporate interests. It was a viral and open-source medium that would allow individuals to compete for attention against the all-consuming hydra of advertising, marketing and public relations. </p> <p>This line of thinking was, in retrospect, breathtakingly naive. It assumed that the act of meme generation by a non-corporate entity would be innately good. Like many instances of the tech-centric idealism, it would unravel in spectacular fashion. It\u2019s not that anti-corporate activists were wrong about how the internet could be leveraged to change politics \u2013 it\u2019s that they were terribly right.</p> <p>There isn\u2019t a straight, causal line connecting the Occupy movement and its many slogans with the neo-Nazi image macros that have been frogmarched out of 4chan to spread hate across the internet in support of Donald Trump. But they share some conceptual DNA. They are both indebted to Guy Debord and the Situationists, specifically the practice of <em tabindex=\"-1\"><a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D%C3%A9tournement\">d\u00e9tournement</a></em>: hijacking expressions of the capitalist system and its media culture against itself. They both also share a deep cynicism about the mainstream media. But this is where the similarities end.</p> <p>When appropriated by the emerging alt-right, memes become a different weapon. They <a href=\"http://www.breitbart.com/milo/2016/05/04/meme-magic-donald-trump-internets-revenge-lazy-entitled-elites/\">call it \u201cmeme magic\u201d</a> \u2013 a phenomenon which has helped vocalize and activate the more extreme wings of the Trump base and introduce white nationalism to a new generation of disaffected nerds. Meme magic is almost identical to meme warfare in that it attempts to use shareable images and ideas in an effort to engender real political change. </p> <p>To date, their most effective memes have been those questioning Hillary Clinton\u2019s health status. Google image search \u201c<a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=Zombie+Hillary&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjzgu_j8YzQAhXHDJAKHR1ZCkUQ_AUICigD&amp;biw=1276&amp;bih=674\">Zombie Hillary</a>\u201d or \u201c<a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=Hillary+Short+Circuit&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjXsuuJ8ozQAhXLF5AKHWukBoQQ_AUICigD&amp;biw=1276&amp;bih=674\">Hillary Short Circuit</a>\u201d and you\u2019ll be treated to a series of imagery made up of equal parts blood and robotics.</p> <p>As explained by Andrew Anglin, publisher of The Daily Stormer, a faux-contrarian neo-Nazi blog, meme magic \u201ccomprises not only an attempt, but a successful attempt, to formulate a new culture for ourselves, separate from the mainstream culture, which is largely the result of Jewish social imperialism\u201d.</p> <p>In a post-truth landscape where distrust of the media has gone mainstream, nickel-and-dime propagandists like Anglin are able to resonate with an audience because they trade in the allure of dark fantasies that appeal to alienated young white men.</p> <p>When the activist left decried corporate control over media, its strongest arguments leaned heavy on well-plodded reasoning. Noam Chomsky\u2019s <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manufacturing_Consent\">Manufacturing Consent </a>instantly comes to mind, in which he painstakingly examines the New York Times\u2019 coverage of the Indonesian occupation of East Timor.</p> <p>The alt-right, on the other hand, is far less interested in thoughtful critiques and far more concerned with control. This mirrors the classic left/right divide of analysis versus action. While the left is typically comfortable with endlessly analyzing what\u2019s wrong with the reality, the right seeks to impose their own reality, currently existing reality be damned.</p> <p>Traditionally, mass media have provided a protective membrane between the public and overly toxic ideas. The mass effect of this delivered a relatively standardized view of politics and world events. For a number of reasons \u2013 a decades-long lowering of journalistic standards, the deterministic effect of ratings and clicks, and the generalized paranoia created by the internet, to name a few \u2013 this membrane has broken down.</p> <p>The recent #draftourdaughters meme provides an instructional example.</p> <p>On 16 May of this year, Hillary Clinton<a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/06/hillary-clinton-women-draft-register-224390\"> voiced support</a> for legislation that would require women to register for the draft. This was largely received as a rare instance a bipartisan support for a purely symbolic gesture, aimed at promoting gender equality in the military.</p> <p>For a maverick like Ted Cruz, it was a chance for him to put on his daddy hat, lambasting the bill because it would \u201cforcibly conscript young girls into combat\u201d. To the paranoiac mind it fed into a conspiracy theory that the next world war is imminent. For the alt-right, it was a perfect opportunity to launch a \u201c<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/59uczc/draftourdaughters_is_weapons_grade_persuasion/\">weapons-grade persuasion</a>\u201d campaign.</p> <p>The result has been a series of <a href=\"https://mic.com/articles/157933/will-hillary-draft-women-inside-draft-our-daughters-a-fake-ad-campaign-from-the-alt-right#.WKMo62xuY\">widely shared fake campaign ads </a>meant to promote the idea that Hillary wanted to send young women to their deaths in a war against Russia. The imagery had a distinctly feminist flavour, with slogans like \u201cHe died for his country. Now, it\u2019s her turn\u201d and \u201cMen make up 97% of combat deaths. It\u2019s time to end the combat gap.\u201d</p> <p>Those orchestrating the campaign instructed their followers to <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/59uczc/draftourdaughters_is_weapons_grade_persuasion/\">\u201cRemind folks when they say it\u2019s fake \u2026 It\u2019s real\u201d</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/GeneralTsoTofu/status/791978959739166720\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Are you <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/WithHer?src=hash\">#WithHer</a>? <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/DraftourDaughters?src=hash\">#DraftourDaughters</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/vk1EXMx560\">pic.twitter.com/vk1EXMx560</a></p>&mdash; Deplorable Tso Tofu (@GeneralTsoTofu) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GeneralTsoTofu/status/791978959739166720\">October 28, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Perhaps this is all a just a garbage mirage brought about by this election cycle\u2019s hate-bubble. But regardless of their long-term viability as a fringe pantomime, those meme creators are at the vanguard of a broad directional trend, and seem to be exploiting it with some measure of success.</p> <p>Irrespective of your personal political leanings, for anyone who thinks sensible dialogue is a critical component to a functioning democracy, there is a large problem to solve here. </p> <p>In his 1946 essay Politics and the English language, which scrutinized the connection between ideology and the proliferation of empty language, George Orwell said:</p> <blockquote> <p>Political language \u2013 and with variations this is true of all political parties, from Conservatives to Anarchists \u2013 is designed to make lies sound truthful and murder respectable, and to give an appearance of solidity to pure wind.</p> </blockquote> <p>We face a similar challenge, albeit one that is punctuated with reaction gifs. If you look at the latest iOS keyboard update, complete with a massive repository of looping imagery, we can see how intimately memes have meshed with language, and how we face a far more daunting challenge than Orwell ever did.</p> <p>The tools we use to communicate are becoming counterproductive to actual communication. It\u2019s only getting easier to spread lies and respond with shrugs. The internet has become an endless theatre of virtual conflict, one in which we are all either willing or oblivious participants, and like it or not, it is on this battlefield that the nature of our reality will probably be decided.</p> <p>There\u2019s no clear answer to this dilemma save for one basic fact: those who value truth desperately need to find a way to make the truth more plausible.</p>",
  "<p>For adults, the news can <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/apr/21/bad-news-media-misery\" title=\"\">be shocking</a>.

The world is at their fingertips. Even if you have done a great job of activating all the parental controls (and your tech-savvy offspring hasn\u2019t simply switched them off again), chances are that bad stuff in the news will be the talk of the playground.

  "<p>The significance of the Paris agreement coming into force today is easy to miss: it may seem like an anti-climax, given the travails that led up to its <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/dec/12/paris-climate-deal-200-nations-sign-finish-fossil-fuel-era\">signing last December</a>.</p> <p>But the moment is of huge importance. This is the first time that a legally-binding agreement, signed by all of the world\u2019s functioning governments, has laid down a commitment to limit the growth of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere with the goal of preventing global warming exceeding 2C above pre-industrial levels. </p> <p>This figure was not plucked out of the increasingly carbon-rich air. It is the limit of what scientists regard as safety, beyond which climate change will run out of control, unstoppable in its damaging effects.</p> <p>There are caveats. The Paris agreement is legally binding in forcing governments to accept and cater for the 2C limit. But the commitments on curbing greenhouse gas emissions in line with that goal are not legally binding. This means incoming governments can renege upon them. There are no sanctions for governments that flout the goals.</p> <p>The outcome of the US presidential election will be key. Donald Trump, the Republican candidate whose polling has improved markedly in recent days, has vowed to cancel the US\u2019s participation in the Paris agreement. Russia has also failed to ratify the agreement, along with several other nations. China has ratified, but if US participation is not forthcoming under a future Trump government, that may be off.</p> <p>So while the agreement should be hailed as a massive and historic step forward in international efforts to avoid dangerous levels of global warming, it is potentially fragile.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the signs of danger are growing increasingly strong. This year is almost certain, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/18/2016-locked-into-being-hottest-year-on-record-nasa-says\">according to Nasa</a>, to be the warmest on record, following last year\u2019s record-setting temperatures. This gives the lie to the claims of warming-dismissers that the upward march of global temperatures has \u201cpaused\u201d.</p> <p>Next year may not set records, but the trend is clear. We are on a trajectory that may lead to warming that is unprecedented and potentially irreversible. While there are other encouraging signs - <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/25/renewables-made-up-half-of-net-electricity-capacity-added-last-year\">the growth in renewable energy use around the world</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/nov/01/global-carbon-intensity-falls-as-coal-use-declines\">small reductions in emissions in some major economies</a> - we should be in no doubt.

  "<p>For Khalid Abdalla, the boundary between life and art has repeatedly blurred and shifted over the past six years. The actor, best known for his roles in films such as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/121902/kite-runner\">The Kite Runner</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/133271/green-zone\">Green Zone</a>, has portrayed a film-maker struggling to finish a documentary in the tense political climate of pre-revolutionary Cairo, starred in a documentary about the 2011 revolution, actually documented the same uprising and its troubled aftermath, and set up a film centre in the Egyptian capital to support independent film-makers.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/03/khalid-abdalla-movie-star-tahrir-square-united-93\">Khalid Abdalla: from movies to Tahrir Square</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Juggling these politically sensitive projects, Abdalla says he felt \u201cprofoundly trapped in a loop\u201d. From being at the centre of the anti-government protests in Tahrir Square, he has since experienced the optimism of the revolution give way to disillusionment. With the rise of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/abdel-fatah-al-sisi\">President </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/abdel-fatah-al-sisi\">Abdel Fatah al-Sisi</a>, he now finds himself precariously navigating a new crackdown on Egyptian artists and activists that recalls the corruption and brutality of the ousted Mubarak regime.</p> <p>Just to compound the sense of deja vu, Abdalla is currently promoting his latest film, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IiFlSxEGnQU\">In the Last Days of the City</a>, which finished shooting in Cairo six weeks before mass demonstrations broke out across <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/egypt\">Egypt</a> on 25 January 2011. The actor plays a film-maker, also called Khalid, in the midst of a creative and personal crisis, seemingly unable to find a direction for his documentary, failing to find a new flat and coming to terms with a breakup \u2013 circumstances complicated by the everyday chaos of the city and the organised violence of the regime.<br></p> <p>\u201cHe is the kind of person that you\u2019re actually afraid you are, who\u2019s nice enough and warm enough, a good enough person but not special,\u201d says the actor. \u201cHe\u2019s been a difficult character to live with.\u201d</p> <p>Yet the actor says there is something progressive about the ineffectual nature of his alter ego. \u201cThe hero [in western and Arab cinema] is frankly someone who normally kills us. Whether it\u2019s the patriarchal or the political, they\u2019re essentially what we\u2019re revolting against.\u201d </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"063f0e5da5aa44f9bead12c76bd9dff817ec1b88\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/063f0e5da5aa44f9bead12c76bd9dff817ec1b88/0_166_2992_1796/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Abdalla in The Kite Runner, 2007.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Abdalla in The Kite Runner, 2007.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Snap Stills/Rex</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In person, Abdalla, 35, exudes the same quiet intensity as the character he portrays. Polite and soft-spoken, his answers are often steeped in political or cultural theory and he can examine or unpick an idea \u2013 sometimes exhaustively \u2013 from every angle. But unlike his fictional counterpart, the actor\u2019s intellectual curiosity does not deter him from action. </p> <p>Abdalla was in London when the revolution broke out on 25 January 2011, but quickly returned to Cairo to join the anti-government demonstrations. He immersed himself in the political and cultural change overtaking Egypt, helping to found the media collective <a href=\"http://mosireen.org/\">Mosireen</a> (meaning \u201cwe are determined\u201d) to document the protests in Tahrir Square, shooting on the frontline of clashes with the police and the army. For the past five years, he has been helping to assemble a digital archive of these historic events from thousands of hours of footage shot by the collective, protestors and eye-witnesses. \u201cI hadn\u2019t picked up a camera before In the Last Days of the City,\u201d he says. \u201cI played a version of who I\u2019ve become.\u201d </p> <p>As Abdalla puts it, the film was made with a sense of foresight and edited with a sense of hindsight. Footage shot amid actual anti-government demonstrations in Cairo in 2010 took on new meaning after the revolution broke out but the actor denies the film anticipated the uprising.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like we had any special insight in terms of what was going to happen,\u201d he says. \u201cThe film\u2019s title was decided in 2008. It\u2019s just that the situation was so awful, things couldn\u2019t carry on like they were. There was a strong sense that something was going to shift and the whole country knew that \u2026 What you see extremely in the film is a people, city, buildings that have been broken down. Broken in the way that you break down animals.\u201d </p> <p>Meanwhile, the film\u2019s portrayal of media censorship, state propaganda and police oppression \u2013 in one scene officers grab a man off the streets and beat him in a side alley \u2013 remains all too recognisable. \u201cScenes we captured so innocently pre-revolution have resonance in the [current] counter-revolution situation,\u201d says Abdalla. \u201cEveryone jokingly says that things have gone back to the way they were [before the revolution] and the film embraces [that].\u201d </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9072e8ca7816300102f5dc3e842978ee921e9b1e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9072e8ca7816300102f5dc3e842978ee921e9b1e/295_0_1187_712/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Khalid Abdalla in a scene from In the Last Days of the City.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Khalid Abdalla in a scene from In the Last Days of the City.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Zero Production</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This perhaps explains why In the Last Days of the City has just been excluded from the <a href=\"http://ciff.org.eg/\">Cairo international film festival</a> (CIFF), where it was due to have its Middle East and North Africa premiere on 17 November. The official reason, given by the festival board in <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/daysofthecity/posts/980893552022540\">a letter sent after the film was shown at the London film festival</a> last month, is that it has had too many international screenings, but Abdalla suspects the truth is more political. More than <a href=\"http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/5/32/247159/Arts--Culture/Film/In-the-Last-Days-of-the-City-continues-to-fight-fo.aspx\">300 film-makers and cultural figures</a> have published a letter calling on CIFF, which is organised by Egypt\u2019s ministry of culture, to reverse the decision.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a heartbreaking situation for us,\u201d says Abdalla. \u201cTheir last-minute deselection has left us without a Middle East and North Africa festival premiere, and sabotaged our plans. We just hope it\u2019s not a sign of what\u2019s to come from censorship.\u201d</p> <p>I first met Abdalla in Cairo in March 2014, when he was helping to establish <a href=\"http://cimatheque.org/\">Cimatheque</a>, an alternative film centre in downtown Cairo, near Tahrir Square, co-founded with the director of In the Last Days of the City, Tamer El Said. This was, he tells me two and a half years later, the darkest period in his life. The revolutionary movement was reeling from the return to military rule following a coup in July 2013 that ousted Egypt\u2019s first elected president, Mohamed Morsi, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/16/rabaa-massacre-egypt-human-rights-watch\">Rabaa massacre the following month</a>, when hundreds of Morsi\u2019s supporters were killed in clashes with the security services, and the subsequent declaration of a state of emergency and curfews across the country.</p> <p>As a star of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/the-square\">The Square</a>, the award-winning 2013 documentary about the revolution and the subsequent political fallout, Abdalla was a highly visible figure and understandably anxious of reprisals by the authorities. One of his friends, who I interviewed days before, had recently burned the source material for his artworks after his flat was raided by the secret police. </p> <p>\u201cI hit the darkest place I\u2019d ever hit at the end of 2013/beginning of 2014,\u201d Abdalla recalls. \u201cThe <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/16/egypt-massacre-morsi-clashes-mosques\">Rabaa massacre</a> had happened and the whole country was under curfew. Mosireen was under threat. The Square was coming out. Cimatheque was being built. I was living in one room in my parents\u2019 house. I was suffocating myself between the split of focus of all of this.</p> <p>\u201cI had a point where I would be woken up by the negativity of my thoughts attacking me for an hour or longer. I couldn\u2019t get rid of the thoughts. It was an hour and a half of attack in the morning. Me staring into space. Just blank walls, a loop of thoughts. The sense of the abyss was overwhelming.\u201d</p> <p>How did he resurface from that hole? \u201cThis will sound really pretentious, but what got me out of it was as soon as I would hear that voice, I\u2019d pick up a book and drown it out with someone else\u2019s words, which I actually wanted to hear,\u201d he says. \u201cBooks of history and the philosophy of revolution, Gilles Deleuze, a lot of economics, stuff that was bigger than me. Reading all of this became therapeutic.\u201d</p> <p>Abdalla\u2019s choice of self-help reflects his deep political convictions and the sense of having a responsibility to pursue a life and career that doesn\u2019t compromise those ideals. Born in Glasgow to Egyptian parents and brought up in London, activism is part of his heritage. His father, Hossam, was a leading student activist in the 1970s and his paternal grandfather, Ibrahim Saad El-Din, was a respected leftist economist. Both men were imprisoned several times because of their politics.</p> <p>So it is perhaps unsurprising that Abdalla\u2019s filmography reads like a guide to the 21st century\u2019s geopolitical crises: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/111619/united.93\">United 93</a> (9/11), <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/121902/kite-runner\">The Kite Runner</a> (the Afghan war), <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/133271/green-zone\">Green Zone</a> (the Iraq war), and The Square (the Egyptian revolution). His next project, out in 2017, is a documentary called <a href=\"http://chickeneggpics.org/film/the-vote/\">The Vote</a>, about the first Egyptian election after Mubarak\u2019s fall, co-directed by his sister, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFeI1mrfTW8\">Hanan</a>, and his wife, Cressida Trew.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f1516a72b08262512b0efbb6563444fce18feea4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f1516a72b08262512b0efbb6563444fce18feea4/0_171_3296_1978/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Paul Greengrass ( left) and Khalid Abdalla (right) on set on United 93.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Paul Greengrass ( left) and Khalid Abdalla (right) on set of the film United 93.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Moviestore Collection/Rex</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI started my career not seeing my colour,\u201d says Abdalla. \u201cBut I graduated from university in 2003, right after the war in Iraq started and while I was there, 9/11 happened. And the films have asked me the question: am I willing to live up to the responsibilities they put in front of me? The last 10 years has been me going into Hollywood cinema, playing Arab roles. I had a right to do that but I don\u2019t feel I had a right to make a career of it without living in the Arab world and without struggling in Arab cinema.\u201d</p> <p>Abdalla\u2019s recent return to London sees him taking on a new but happier responsibility \u2013 fatherhood. His son Nawar\u2019s name means one who brings light. \u201cWe certainly need it,\u201d he says, smiling. \u201cI\u2019m extremely happy I have a child now. I feel freed by it.\u201d</p> <p>Yet the actor will return to Cairo in this month, staying until just before Christmas. \u201cThen in January we work out what to do afterwards,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019ve understood that there has to be a lifetime of living in both places. I can\u2019t leave Egypt and I can\u2019t leave here. Part of that struggle is the arc of my family and I don\u2019t want to burden my child with it.\u201d</p> <p>What hope does he have now for a democratic Egypt to emerge from the remains of the revolution? \u201cThe situation right now is horrendous \u2013 economically, politically, socially,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t know whether it\u2019s going to go from worse to worse or whether there\u2019s another watershed moment that no one will easily put their faith in. Everything\u2019s closing down. But we\u2019re going to try to salvage as much as we can. I feel the need to live for that whatever the cost.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://variety.com/2016/film/festivals/in-the-last-days-of-the-city-review-berlin-film-festival-1201705591/\">In the Last Days of the City</a> will be screened <a href=\"https://www.ica.org.uk/whats-on/film-africa-last-days-city-akher-ayam-el-madina-qa\">on 5 November at the ICA</a>, London, as part of the <a href=\"https://www.ica.org.uk/whats-on/film-africa\">Film Africa</a> festival.

  "<p>There are a couple of things to know about the Queensland University of Technology racial discrimination case.<br></p> <p>The first is that the legal action, which has centred on a trio of students alleged to have engaged in racial vilification, has become a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre for opponents of 18C \u2013 the provision that prohibits offending, insulting, humiliating or intimidating another person on the grounds of race.</p> <p>The second thing to know is it really doesn\u2019t matter what happened in the court on Friday. For politicians who want to overhaul 18C, Friday\u2019s outcome was always going to be a case of heads we win, tails we win.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/nov/04/david-leyonhjelm-calls-for-repeal-of-18c-in-return-for-his-vote-on-industrial-relations\">David Leyonhjelm calls for repeal of 18C in return for his vote on industrial relations</a> </p> </aside>  <p>If the case was thrown out, the outcome would be spun by the anti-18C brigade as an example of everything that\u2019s wrong with the provision, because look at all the time, stress and resources that have gone into defending an action that never should have proceeded this far.</p> <p>If the case proceeded, then this would be proof positive that the law is an ass. Just for the record, the case was thrown out.</p> <p>Before it was even announced, Friday\u2019s decision was being hyped in certain quarters as a landmark and a turning point but, in reality, is nothing of the kind. Here\u2019s what you need to know about what happens next.</p> <p>Overhauling 18C has emerged as a key test by which Liberal leaders are judged.</p> <p>The contemporary right, while dabbling liberally in identity politics frolics of its own, is obsessed with pushing back on the identity politics and the rights agenda of the left.</p> <p>Tony Abbott tried and failed to overhaul 18C, which is one of the main reasons he lost the support of conservatives to remain prime minister last September.</p> <p>Almost immediately after the July election, conservatives in the government moved to make 18C Turnbull\u2019s test <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/30/cory-bernardis-racial-discrimination-revolt-supported-by-up-to-20-senators\">and they have not let up since</a>.</p> <p>It has been obvious for some time that Turnbull is going to have to replay this debate in some shape or form. The internals demand it.</p> <p>So the prime minister has in the past couple of weeks, and again on Friday, signalled support for a parliamentary investigation by the human rights committee \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/oct/28/broaden-free-speech-debate-beyond-racial-discrimination-act-says-liberal-senator\">an idea being pushed by the Liberal senator Dean Smith.</a></p> <p>The Smith proposal would wrap up consideration of 18C in a more broad-ranging inquiry looking at freedom of expression, which would bring other issues into the mix, like the defamation law for example, which well-resourced individuals, like politicians, tend to make liberal use of.</p> <p>Even though the evidence suggests we really don\u2019t have a problem with 18C as it currently stands \u2013 most cases are resolved at conciliation, only 1% of the complaints last year ever made it to the inside of a courtroom \u2013 the Smith inquiry is not a terrible idea.</p> <p>It would make 18C, the sequel, something of a fair fight.</p> <p>Community groups can have their say. (Again, yes I know, sorry folks.) It would allow consideration of the 18C restrictions alongside the other curbs that currently exist on speech in Australia \u2013 the ones politicians don\u2019t generally rush to complain about, the sorts of curbs on free speech that work to protect the powerful, as opposed to the curbs that work to protect the vulnerable.</p> <p>To put this most simply: a process like the one Smith envisages would test just how free the \u201cfreedom\u201d crowd really wants things to be and whether, when push came to shove, some freedoms proved to be more equal than others.</p> <p>For what it\u2019s worth, here\u2019s what I think about removing the words insult and offend from the RDA.</p> <p>As a journalist I support removing as many curbs on free expression and free publication as possible. I have a professional interest, in fact, in removing as many curbs on free expression as possible.</p> <p>So I\u2019m happy to countenance a rebalancing of the RDA, provided the rebalancing of the free speech framework is proportionate and fair. I\u2019m not happy to leave restrictions in place that aid the powerful while going after restrictions that protect the vulnerable. Reasonableness in all the circumstances has to be the threshold test.</p> <p>The other caveat I\u2019d add to my professional support for speech and communication to be as unfettered as possible is I am a white woman of Anglo-Celtic descent. It\u2019s fair to say I\u2019m about as white as it\u2019s possible to be.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/nov/01/cory-bernardi-welcomes-free-speech-inquiry-if-it-leads-to-overhaul-of-18c\">Cory Bernardi welcomes free speech inquiry if it leads to overhaul of 18C</a> </p> </aside>  <p>While I have encountered nasty, deeply distressing sexism and casual acts of workplace discrimination; while I\u2019ve been patronised, pitied, marginalised, talked over top of; while I\u2019ve been the unhappy recipient of the unsolicited mansplain \u2013 I have never encountered racism.</p> <p>I don\u2019t know what that feels like. I don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like to be insulted or offended <em>on the basis of my race</em> and that\u2019s what the provision prevents.</p> <p>Section 18C doesn\u2019t prevent people insulting or offending each other in the ordinary course of events. My inviolable human right to call someone a dickhead at a barbecue remains untrammelled.</p> <p>And before we rush to wind back the existing racial discrimination protections on the basis they are an inconvenience for the poor, oppressed, white culture warrior of a certain age, who, like me, have almost certainly never been insulted on the basis of their race \u2013 we need to stop and listen to the voices of people who have.</p>",

By selectively changing pixels in an image, it\u2019s possible to leave the human-comprehensible facial image largely unchanged, while flummoxing a facial recognition system trying to categorise the person in the picture.</p> <p>Where the researchers struck gold was by realising that a large (but not overly large pair of glasses) could act to \u201cchange the pixels\u201d even in a real photo. By picking a pair of \u201cgeek\u201d frames, with relatively large rims, the researchers were able to obscure about 6.5% of the pixels in any given facial picture. Printing a pattern over those frames then had the effect of manipulating the image.</p> <p>But because computers don\u2019t read faces the same way people do, the patterns printed over the frames look to an untrained eye like a regular, if garish, tortoiseshell pattern. They\u2019re cheap too: the researchers were able to print the pattern for just $0.22 (\u00a30.18) per frame, using a normal photo printer.</p> <p>The end result is impressive. The glasses were able to fool both commercial facial recognition software Face++, as well as a more specific model trained exclusively on five researchers and five celebrities. With just the pair of glasses on their faces, the researchers were able to successfully prevent the software from recognising their faces at all, as well as impersonate each other and celebrities including Milla Jovovich and Carson Daly.</p> <p>The work is not without its limitations. The researchers warn that \u201cthe variations in imaging conditions that we investigate in this work are narrower than can be encountered in practice\u201d.</p> <p>The researchers took photos in a room with no external windows to control lighting, for instance. But they point out that many uses of facial recognition software, including biometric entry to a building, have similarly limited variations. </p> <p>In other cases, that control is lost, of course: \u201cAn attacker may not be able to control the lighting or her distance from the camera when [a facial recognition system] is deployed in the street for surveillance purposes,\u201d the researchers say.</p> <p>If you\u2019re hoping to wear the glasses at boozy parties to fool your friends\u2019 auto-tagging \u2026 well, as the researchers say, \u201cthe notion of inconspicuousness is subjective\u201d.

Yet within this tapestry of ideas was something so elegant and elastic that it walks a path from then to now with ease \u2013 a unified theory of media that describes our relationship to its technologies in a single phrase; the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2014/apr/05/einstein-equation-emc2-special-relativity-alok-jha\" title=\"\">E=mc<sup>2</sup> of the information age</a>. The medium is the&#xa0;message.</p> <p>McLuhan starts with a simple thought, then spirals outward in surprising ways. His imaginative leap involved seeing the media we create as \u201cextensions of ourselves\u201d, whose primary importance is to change not what we know, but our relationship to the world and the processes by which we act upon it; how we think, behave, dream and connect with other people. The medium is its own message, enabling and constraining in and of itself. \u201cWe shape our tools and thereafter they shape us,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Through the hallucinatory fug of 2016 I\u2019ve been thinking a lot about McLuhan \u2013 and never more than in the past fortnight, when the confluence of two apparently unrelated events suddenly struck me as significant. First a candidate for the American presidency threatened to repudiate an election result if he lost, opening a path to civil disobedience or violence on the part of his followers. I\u2019m working in Los Angeles at the moment, and hearing this reminded me of the way two separate Americans recently offered sympathy for my having to live under sharia law in the UK, commiserating with the way Birmingham is now off-limits to all but Islamic State members and Jason Statham. When I told them that, unless this had occurred in the fortnight since I\u2019d left, it wasn\u2019t true, they looked me coolly in the eye and insisted it was \u2013 that I, who live in the UK, was mistaken.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ddb77ad12d8bfb8171bf9bd56ac4e4e0f9a78f2e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ddb77ad12d8bfb8171bf9bd56ac4e4e0f9a78f2e/0_32_2560_1536/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jon Hamm as Don Draper in Mad Men\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jon Hamm as Don Draper in Mad Men helped popularise new entertainment outlets such as HBO and Netflix.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Lionsgate Television</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>How on earth to make sense of this?

When in the US, shows by Netflix and competitors such as HBO, Amazon, AMC and Hulu are now <em>all</em> I watch; in the UK <em>almost all</em>, as even the BBC\u2019s willingness to take risks falls to a fragmenting audience, political pressure and the concomitant obsession with bums on seats. And this is good, n\u2019est-ce pas? People whose education/outlook/experience disposes them to look for surprise and originality in their media have a place to go. People who want the comfort of predictability have their places, too.

But if you talk to early adopters, most will say the net\u2019s real wonder was in allowing them to commune with like-minded people everywhere, unfettered by geography.</p> <p>If you were an avant-garde jazz fan in Billericay, now you could find other fans to talk to, until before long you had your own virtual \u201ccommunity\u201d. And unlike a physical space, you never had to leave this one, never had to interact with anyone you didn\u2019t want to. Twenty-five years later, net algorithms will feed you material based entirely on your past, with no notion of a potential future; of growth or challenge. We\u2019re all being reinforced, all the time, and it feels good \u2013 until we find ourselves on the sharp side of a Brexit vote.</p> <p>There seems little doubt that over two and a half decades, this atomisation has changed us \u2013 the medium has been the message \u2013 helping to create an environment in which superficially confounding phenomena such as Brexit and Donald Trump and the measurable rise of narcissism are perfectly logical, if not inevitable. Indeed, the provocative documentarian Adam Curtis goes one step further, suggesting in his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/oct/15/hypernormalisation-adam-curtis-trump-putin-syria\" title=\"\">new film HyperNormalisation</a> that the new technology, far from having caused the fragmentation we see and feel, merely amplified a model of \u201cradical individualism\u201d that had been evolving since the late 1960s and is now dominant. In this model \u2013 an understandable reaction to the misuse of power by leaders in the 50s and 60s \u2013 truth to self becomes the ultimate and only truth, with self-expression its conveyor and personal preference the lone arbiter.</p> <p>It\u2019s been said that with new technologies we tend to foresee the positives but be blindsided by the negatives. Can individual choice be a negative? When I set out to write my book Moondust, which involved tracking down the (then) <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/apr/24/biography.features\" title=\"\">nine surviving men who had walked on the moon</a>, one of my questions was why some had fared well upon returning \u2013 spinning off at delightfully surprising tangents \u2013 and others not.</p> <p>In retrospect, it seems to me that those inclined to see their feats not as individual achievements, but as merely the most visible part of a shared collective effort, were more likely to integrate their experiences into productive lives thereafter. So in my opinion, the most empowering, liberating feeling a human can have is that in the scheme of things they\u2019re unimportant, in service to something greater than themselves, with all the constraint to personal choice so entailed.</p>",
  "<p>Pressure is mounting for a public inquiry into the adoption of hundreds of thousands of babies born to unmarried women over a 30-year period amid claims from some mothers who say they were coerced into handing over their children.</p> <p>A letter will be sent to the home secretary, Amber Rudd, next week from solicitors at two eminent law firms calling on her to convene a public inquiry into historical adoption practices in the UK. The solicitors say an inquiry would uncover the truth about the practices \u2013 stretching over three decades after the end of the second world war \u2013 and hold agencies to account. </p> <p>Meanwhile more women have come forward to tell their stories of being pressured into having their babies adopted.<br></p> <p>The call for an inquiry will be sent to Rudd on Thursday, the day after the broadcast of a television documentary relating the stories of several women. That film has prompted an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/nov/03/catholic-church-apologises-for-role-in-forced-adoptions-over-30-year-period\">apology from Cardinal Vincent Nichols, head of the Catholic church in England and Wales</a>, and a statement expressing regret from the Church of England. Religious institutions and agencies handled most adoptions until 1976, after which the process became the responsibility of local authorities.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/03/christian-churches-forced-adoptions-in-the-uk-did-you-lose-your-child\">Christian churches' 'forced adoptions' in the UK: did you lose your child?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Carolynn Gallwey, of Bhatt Murphy Solicitors, and Karon Monaghan, of Matrix Chambers, are demanding an inquiry to acknowledge the trauma suffered by young vulnerable mothers and the impact on their lives. On a practical level, they say an inquiry could lead to records being made available and professional counselling offered.<br></p> <p>\u201cIt is the only way to get a proper understanding of what happened and identify any systemic issues which amounted to coercion, whether there were policies \u2013 formal or informal \u2013 which discouraged young women from keeping their babies,\u201d said Gallwey.<br></p> <p>About half a million babies, most born to unmarried women, were adopted in the 1950s, 60s and 70s when the Catholic church, Church of England and the Salvation Army ran \u201cmother and baby homes\u201d and adoption agencies in the UK. Adoption reached a peak in 1968, when more than 16,000 babies born to unmarried mothers were handed over to new families.<br></p> <p>In recent years, some women have publicly said they feel they were effectively forced to hand over their babies. Now mostly in their 60s and 70s, they say that as vulnerable young women they were made to feel shame and guilt, and were told that adoption was in the best interests of themselves and their babies.<br></p> <p>\u201cThere is a very compelling set of facts from a recent period of our history which is still having an impact now,\u201d said Gallwey. An inquiry, she added, could \u201ccorrect the myth that these women gave away their babies voluntarily\u201d. </p> <p>She added: \u201cAll the women I\u2019ve spoken to say that [the women acted voluntarily] could not be further from the truth. The saddest thing is the number of women who say, \u2018no one told me there was another way\u2019. It\u2019s still very raw even after so long.\u201d<br></p> <p>The call for a public inquiry was backed by Graham Allen, Labour MP for Nottingham North, who sponsored a parliamentary motion last year calling on the government to apologise for \u201cunacceptable adoption and care practices of the past\u201d.<br></p> <p>He said an inquiry \u201cwould draw a line for everyone\u201d, adding: \u201cNo monetary amount could compensate for what these people have been through, but it could be cathartic and cleansing.\u201d<br></p> <p>Veronica Smith, co-founder of the <a href=\"https://movementforanadoptionapology.org/\">Movement for an Adoption Apology</a>, also backed the call. \u201cWe\u2019ve been trying to get something done for years.

She was verbally and physically abused by the nuns in the home,\u201d the 56-year-old said. \u201cWhen I was born I was taken away from her, but because I was half-Iranian and a dark baby they couldn\u2019t find anyone to adopt me.

So where was the transition plan? | Gay Alcorn</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The second significant development is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/nov/04/paris-climate-change-agreement-enters-into-force\">the entry into force of the historic Paris agreement on climate change</a> (in about one eighth of the time it took the Kyoto protocol to achieve the same milestone). Although Australia is yet to ratify the agreement, it is already law in many of our largest trading partners, committing them and much of the globe to ambitious carbon reduction targets and eventually a net zero carbon economy. </p> <p>The mindset of business leaders and regulators around the world has shifted \u2013 the business and financial risks climate change poses are not only real and significant but they are here now. As the Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, said in September, if climate change is a \u201ctragedy of the horizons\u201d then the Paris agreement \u2013 and the markets that are already pricing in major changes in business as usual \u2013 bring that horizon forward.</p> <p>These two developments were front of mind at a business roundtable I helped to moderate last month to discuss Hutley\u2019s opinion. </p> <p>I was struck there by how clearly directors now see this challenge. Hutley\u2019s opinion confirms we now have little choice but to understand how important climate change and sustainability risks are for us personally and for our companies, and act accordingly. The question directors should be, and now are, asking themselves is not \u201cshould we be considering this at all\u201d but \u201chow do we make sure we\u2019re doing this well enough?\u201d </p> <p>One positive to come out of Hutley\u2019s opinion and the Paris agreement is that there is only an upside for companies and directors that do it best. They will be well placed to benefit from, or even influence, rising expectations of shareholders, customers and regulators. The premium that market participants are placing on constructive approaches to sustainability issues is rising. This is especially striking in the case of the large institutional investors with long-term mandates (including in Australia\u2019s superannuation industry) who see effective board-level management of environment and sustainability-related issues as a key proxy for governance, risk management and good long-term strategy. </p> <p>The roundtable has propelled a critical conversation about how those in leadership positions \u2013 on boards, regulators, director associations and peak bodies \u2013 can ensure directors have the targets, tools, skills and processes in place to meet higher internal and external governance expectations.</p> <p>We have become accustomed to seeing climate and sustainability issues as far off challenges but we only need to take our cues from the market (as well as meteorologists) to see that these shifts are already happening under our feet. Companies that aren\u2019t preparing for physical, transition and liability risks now are simply ensuring more destabilising, risky and abrupt changes later. The same goes for entire economies. Business leaders should support constructive changes at the level of board governance and government policy to make sure that does not happen. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/jan/01/climate-change-paris-cop21-business-greenhouse-gas-emissions-targets\">How to help your company prepare for climate change in 2016</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The director community is justifiably wary of more obligations being foisted on directors without the capabilities or guidance needed to prioritise and meet them. This is why the discussion about directors\u2019 duties is not about overburdening directors with additional requirements or regulation. It is about asking what the content of these fundamental duties will be in the 21st century governance environment \u2013 and about ensuring directors are in position to discharge them. </p> <p>Boards must educate themselves on the best way to identify, disclose and respond to climate and sustainability risks, not just for legal or environmental reasons but because the market demands we do so. There is still time to improve but, as this week shows, it is running short. </p> <p>Together, we must strengthen risk analysis and integrated reporting, build technical proficiency around measuring sustainability trends and risks, ensure effective communication with institutional investors and diversify the voices around the boardroom table to ensure the right set of skills, experiences and perspectives. </p> <p>These steps can ensure directors can ask better questions and get better answers on climate and sustainability risks and opportunities as we embrace the post-Paris horizon.</p>",
  "<p>Last night two documentaries each made a particle contribution to a conclusive explanation of precisely what the hell is going wrong in the land of my birth these days. The first, <strong>Conspiracy Files: The Trump Dossier</strong> (BBC2), set out to explore some of the conspiracy theories <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\" title=\"\">Donald Trump</a> has deployed over the course of his campaign.</p> <p>One could argue that in these dark times we have great need for programming dedicated to debunking conspiracy theories, but nobody who believes the moon landings were faked is going to be swayed by anything as straightforward as evidence.</p> <p>Conspiracy Files went one better \u2013 shedding light on the motivations of the theorists themselves. Somewhere behind all the paranoiacs and numbskulls are a group of people \u2013 for lack of a better term, let\u2019s call them bad guys \u2013 who propound and promulgate conspiracy theories for their own ends. People for whom facts are an inconvenience. People like Donald Trump.</p> <p>Trump rose to political prominence as a leading light of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/jul/28/birther-movement-obama-citizenship\" title=\"\">birther movement</a>, a long and thoroughly disreputable campaign to de-legitimise America\u2019s first black president by insinuating that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/barack-obama\" title=\"\">Barack Obama</a> wasn\u2019t born in the US. Though he had nothing to add to the theory beyond publicity, he stubbornly maintained its validity until it stopped helping him, at which point he unceremoniously abandoned it.</p> <p>One wonders how such disloyalty is viewed by hardcore birthers. Moldovan dentist <a href=\"http://www.orlytaitzesq.com/\" title=\"\">Orly Taitz</a> thinks Obama\u2019s birth certificate is an anachronistic forgery, because it lists Obama\u2019s father as \u201cAfrican\u201d instead of \u201cNegro\u201d. She seems to view this as a cover-up undone by political correctness gone mad.</p> <p>\u201cThis is so bad, it\u2019s like it\u2019s done by a retarded five-year-old,\u201d she says. You hear this a lot in conspiracy theorist circles: the people who secretly perpetrated the biggest fraud in history are total morons. Later on, a handwriting expert who claims a suicide note written by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2016/may/23/campaign-president-2016-live-updates-trump-clinton-sanders-polling\" title=\"\">Vince Foster</a> (the Clinton associate who killed himself in 1993) was fake derided it as \u201camateurish, sloppy; I\u2019ve seen better by kids\u201d.</p> <p>Throughout his campaign, Trump has been aided, directly or indirectly, by people who have, at best, a tangential relationship to the truth.

There\u2019s the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2014/jul/29/us-press-publishing-magazines\" title=\"\">National Enquirer editor</a> who, faced with one of his own headlines, says, \u201c\u2018Ted Cruz\u2019s Father Linked to JFK Assassination\u2019 \u2013 what\u2019s wrong with that?\u201d This wasn\u2019t really a documentary about the triumph of paranoia and fear, but of cynicism. We\u2019ll have to wait until Tuesday to see if it has taken charge.</p> <p>If you did fancy a documentary about the triumph of paranoia and fear, <strong>The Gun Shop: Cutting Edge</strong> (Channel&#xa0;4) fits the bill. It was, if anything, an even more disheartening look at the present state of American affairs. Focusing on the staff and customers of a single premises in Battle Creek, Michigan, The Gun Shop was almost entirely populated by people who believe the solution to America\u2019s gun epidemic is way more guns.</p> <p>Freedom Firearms sells weapons, operates a shooting range and offers tuition. The proprietor tracks the popularity of guns by \u201chow many people take part in my concealed carry class\u201d. Here he schools people in the \u201c21 foot rule\u201d: apparently if someone within that range fancies stabbing you, you won\u2019t be able to draw your gun in time to save yourself. \u201cSo don\u2019t let people get too close,\u201d he says.</p> <p>His clientele were all nice people who just happened to share a worldview that was irrational, fearful and bolstered by wrongheaded slogans (\u201cAn armed society is a polite society\u201d). Folks really do respond to news of gun crime by going straight out to purchase a gun. Single mum Courtney bought a handgun because \u201cmy social media has just blown up with all the craziness that\u2019s going on in the world\u201d. Then she taught her nine-year-old son to use it.</p> <p>In the midst of this chilling portrait of everyday gun-shopping, I thought I detected some reasons to be faintly hopeful: nobody seemed consumed by hate; everybody seemed to take the responsibility of gun-ownership seriously, even if they didn\u2019t seem to give much consideration to the idea of killing another human being; there wasn\u2019t much in the way of right-to-bear-arms pontificating. But I gave in to despair as the shop owner walked staff through an armed robbery scenario. He wasn\u2019t so worried about the 21ft rule. \u201cI\u2019ve got other employees who\u2019re gonna smoke him,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s gonna be in a circular firing&#xa0;squad.\u201d</p> <p>The notion of a circular firing squad is about as apt a metaphor for the US\u2019s relationship with guns as I\u2019ve heard, and it\u2019s not remotely encouraging.</p>",

The company had fallen from its prominence in decades past, however, when Clark hosted variety shows, such as American Bandstand, to consistently strong ratings.</p> <p>Industry sources <a href=\"http://variety.com/2016/biz/news/dalian-wanda-group-dick-clark-productions-buy-1-billion-1201909123/\">told Variety magazine </a>they were surprised by the deal, with two people calling the $1bn sale \u201cnonsensical\u201d and \u201cunreal\u201d.</p> <p>The Chinese firm said the American company\u2019s management \u201cwill remain in its entirety\u201d and that Wanda \u201chas signed a long-term operation target agreement with the management\u201d. </p> <p>In late September the Wanda Group\u2019s chairman, Wang Jianlin, drew the attention of 16 members of Congress who <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/01/world/asia/china-us-foreign-acquisition-dalian-wanda.html\">questioned the actions of his company</a>, which they said was a \u201cstate champion\u201d of Beijing.

He has also said that he hopes the group will control 20% of the world\u2019s movie theater seats by 2020, up from the 13% it currently owns in China, the US and Europe, after recent purchases of Odeon and UCI Cinemas.
