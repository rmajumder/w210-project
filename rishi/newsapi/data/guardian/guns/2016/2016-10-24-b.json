  "<p>Renee Wootton didn\u2019t set out to smash any stereotypes, she just wanted to find friends when she moved to live with her grandparents in Marlee, a small town on the mid north coast of New South Wales.</p> <p>But when she joined the Australian Air Force Cadets as a teen, she discovered a passion for aircraft that led her to a career in aerospace engineering \u2013 an unusual choice for a woman, especially one with an Indigenous background.</p> <p>Wootton, now 23, is in the graduate program at Qantas with an honours degree under her belt, thanks to her own hard work and dedication and a number of programs that gave her a helping hand.</p> <p>Putting to one side the dearth of female engineers (around 14% of enrolments), the number of Indigenous students who enrol in Stem courses (science, technology, engineering and maths) is tiny \u2013 fewer than 1%. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://docs.education.gov.au/system/files/doc/other/atsiheac_background_paper_stem.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">represent around 1.4%</a> (pdf) of all university enrolments. Around 3% of the Australian population is Indigenous. </p> <p>This absence from Stem is locking them out of some of the most rewarding and high-paying jobs. Of fast-growing occupations, 75% require Stem skills.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/oct/17/autistic-employees-can-give-companies-an-edge-in-innovative-thinking\">Autistic employees can give companies an edge in innovative thinking</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Wootton says she had a drive to achieve: \u201cFor me, I didn\u2019t have a family that stuck together. My parents divorced early on and Mum never really had a steady job \u2013 so that was a life I didn\u2019t want for myself\u201d.</p> <p>Once Wootton discovered her love for aircraft engines, she took extra tutoring at school to try to get the marks she needed to get to university.</p> <p>The aerospace engineering course at the University of NSW required an ATAR score of 93. Wootton achieved 80.71, but was awarded entry into an alternative pathway for Indigenous students, via a diploma in science, engineering and technology. After a year, she was able to transfer to the degree course.</p> <p>In Sydney, she joined a mentoring and support service for Indigenous university students, CareerTrackers, which placed her in an internship at Qantas. </p> <p>Qantas group executive of brand, marketing and corporate affairs, Olivia Wirth, says around <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.reconciliation.org.au/raphub/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/reconciliation-action-plan-2015-2018.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">1% (317 people)</a> of the airline\u2019s employees are of Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander background.</p> <p>Qantas is working towards a target of 1.5% by 2018 and, once it achieves that, will continue to keep increasing the proportion, she says.</p> <p>\u201cWe are the national carrier and that has a lot of meaning. We believe it is important to play a leadership role \u2013 across the issue of diversity, not just Indigenous diversity,\u201d she says.</p> <p>\u201cWe believe reconciliation is important and we want to have a positive impact on the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community.\u201d </p> <p>The airline has a number of Indigenous employment programs in place, but last year was one of the first companies to sign a 10-year contract with CareerTrackers. Qantas will provide a minimum of 250 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander internships over 10 years, with 100 Indigenous internships over the first three years.</p> <p>Wirth says the airline has a focus on getting diversity in the people employed in its Stem roles, which include pilots and engineers, and Indigenous people have been part of that.</p> <p>Michael Combs is the founder of <a href=\"http://www.careertrackers.org.au/ \" rel=\"nofollow\">CareerTrackers</a>, now in its seventh year, and says 94% of its interns <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.hcamag.com/hr-news/indigenous-interns-soaring-says-careertrackers-report-216982.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">graduate</a> from university (compared with the 40% of Indigenous students not in the program). </p> <p>Combs credits this success rate to the sense of community, mutual support and accountability generated among the interns.</p> <p>Combs says around 200 CareerTrackers students are doing Stem degrees and are being recruited by a wide range of companies which are looking for the \u201cStem way of thinking\u201d.</p> <p>Australian software company Atlassian is looking for ways to employ more people of Indigenous background and has so far hosted one intern through CareerTrackers last summer. \u201cHe was a first-year IT student at uni and he was so great that we are bringing him back for a second internship,\u201d says head of diversity, Aubrey Blanche.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/oct/10/gender-diversity-at-work-using-education-to-tackle-the-backlash\">Gender diversity at work: using education to tackle the backlash</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThat is definitely a partnership we are looking at continuing in the future.\u201d</p> <p>Last year, the CSIRO and BHP Billiton Foundation launched the $28.8m Indigenous Stem education program. This ambitious five-year project has the twin aims of encouraging Indigenous students into Stem careers, while integrating traditional Indigenous science into school curricula.</p> <p>The project director of the Indigenous Stem education program, Therese Postma, says integrating Indigenous content into schools\u2019 science classes is a way of engaging the interest of Indigenous and non-Indigenous children.</p> <p>\u201cThere is <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://research.acer.edu.au/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1290&amp;context=research_conference\" rel=\"nofollow\">literature</a> that says Indigenous students are slightly more interested in science than non-Indigenous students,\u201d she says. </p> <p>\u201cI think that links back to [the fact] there are still a lot who are working on the land and that links to responsibilities, what their family do, culturally, and cultural practices.\u201d</p> <p>This program also runs <a href=\"http://www.csiro.au/en/Education/Programs/Indigenous-STEM\" rel=\"nofollow\">free summer schools</a> for year 10 Indigenous students, across the country. \u201cThe feedback we have had from those summer schools has been that students have come there thinking they might be a bricklayer in their community \u2013 and have left thinking they can be an engineer,\u201d says Postma.</p> <p>They can then take part in a leadership program, which supports them through the rest of their high school years and provides workplace opportunities in Stem areas.</p> <p>Students are also offered a place in a Melbourne University-run bachelor of science, which is extended an extra year to four years so that young people who may face greater challenges in a tertiary education environment have time to get up to speed.</p> <p>These university students are not required to qualify by their Atar score, but are accepted for their passion and interest in the subject. It is hoped that, at the end of the five years of BHP Billiton foundation funding, many of the elements of the program will have become self-sustaining and that funding can be found for the rest.</p> <p>Aboriginal-owned business, Indigi Lab, <a href=\"http://www.indigilab.com.au/what-is-indigenous-science/\" rel=\"nofollow\">promotes Indigenous science,</a> while also encouraging Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children to take up Stem careers. Co-founder Luke Briscoe, a Kuku Yalanji man from far north Queensland explains Indigenous science has been around for 80,000 years or more. \u201cScience for Indigenous people is a way of knowing and a way of life. It is part of our culture,\u201d he says. </p> <p>In November, Indigi Lab is delivering an ecotech program to 130 Indigenous youth, covering subjects such as project planning, cultural brokerage, app development and marketing.</p> <p>It is also holding <a href=\"https://maas.museum/event/maas-presents-indigi-lab-streams-iq-i-with-dr-david-suzuki/\" rel=\"nofollow\">a panel discussion</a> with scientist Dr David Suzuki on 28 October at the Powerhouse Museum on how Indigenous and western sciences and knowledge systems can work together.

  "<p>The new head of the Financial Conduct Authority is being urged to remain independent from politicians and instigate change at the City regulator amid fears that rules introduced since the 2008 crisis are being watered down.</p> <p>The call to Andrew Bailey \u2013 who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/26/george-osborne-appoints-andrew-bailey-fca-chief\">took the helm of the FCA in July after a long career at the Bank of England</a> \u2013 is made in a report published on Tuesday which says there should be an overhaul of the way financial regulators are run.</p> <p>The report by the New City Agenda thinktank highlights a reversal of some of the changes made since the banking crisis eight years ago. It points <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jul/17/city-watchdog-chief-quits-fca-george-osborne\">to the departure of Bailey\u2019s predecessor, Martin Wheatley</a>, as \u201ca political sacking orchestrated by the Treasury\u201d and intended to signal a softer approach to the City. It describes a weakening of rules intended to hold bankers to account by forcing them to demonstrate they had behaved correctly \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/oct/15/financial-accountability-regime-will-not-be-fully-operational-until-2018\">the so-called reverse burden of proof</a> \u2013 a year ago as the fastest climbdown in 300 years of financial regulation.</p> <p>\u201cThere is a clear and present danger that we will repeat the mistakes of history. Much-needed change is already being watered down,\u201d the report said. \u201cThe attention of politicians has moved on. </p> <p>\u201cThe vote to leave the European Union will mean that the UK will be in full control of its regulation, but it will also have significant resource implications for regulators over the coming years. Regulators need to redouble their efforts to change their culture and move away from the bureaucratic and ineffective approaches of the past.\u201d </p> <p>Bailey, who is setting out his \u201cmission\u201d for the FCA this week, was called upon to resist political inference. \u201cLeadership changes and the perception of political interference were in danger of making the FCA into a timid and cowed regulator,\u201d the report said.</p> <p>The cost of City regulation is six times greater than it was 16 years ago, reaching \u00a31.2bn a year, as a result of bureaucratic and ineffective rules, the report said. </p> <p>The report \u2013 written by Andr\u00e9 Spicer, a professor at Cass business school at City, University of London \u2013 calls on the FCA to use new powers to name and shame misleading adverts and take action against senior executives.</p> <p>It also calls for the abolition of rules that allow regulators to cite their inability to disclose confidential information about firms. \u201cThe current framework has damaged efforts to hold regulators accountable,\u201d the report said.</p> <p>New City Agenda was formed in the aftermath of the banking crisis and is backed, among others, by John McFall, a former MP who used to chair the Treasury select committee.</p>",
  "<p><strong></strong>The UK is to resume training the Syrian moderate opposition, sending a further 20 Ministry of Defence personnel to the Middle East to help them prepare for an eventual attack on Islamic State\u2019s Syrian headquarters.</p> <p>The defence secretary, Michael Fallon, is due to announce on Tuesday that the trainers will restart working with moderate Syrian opposition fighters in infantry, medical and explosive hazard awareness skills as part of the campaign against Isis. UK military personnel are currently involved in coalition airstrikes on Isis targets in Iraq and Syria.</p> <p>The move \u2013 largely a resumption of discontinued training \u2013 will disappoint moderates who have been asking for much more substantial aid, including heavier arms and superior air support.</p> <p>It comes as the Iraqi army, backed by a patchwork of local and international forces including the Kurdish peshmerga and Shia militias, pursue an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/23/mosul-offensive-turkish-and-kurdish-forces-launch-attacks-on-isis\">offensive to oust Isis from Mosul</a>, the group\u2019s last significant stronghold in Iraq. If, as is expected, that ends in defeat for Isis, the battle for the city of Raqqa in north-west Syria could be the next big challenge. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/24/fears-battle-for-mosul-open-new-front-wider-sunni-shia-conflict-iraq-turkey\">Fears battle for Mosul could open new front in wider Sunni-Shia conflict</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The British government hopes the trainers will not only improve the capabilities of existing fighters but also generate new forces. Fallon said that up to 20 UK personnel would deploy to locations in the region \u201cto provide vetted members of the moderate Syrian opposition with the skills they need to continue to take the fight to Islamic State\u201d.</p> <p>But any British decision to help the rebels, however limited, will prove controversial. Previous attempts by the US and UK to train moderate forces have ended <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/sep/16/us-military-syrian-isis-fighters\">in disappointment and some embarrassment</a>, with the forces collapsing in the face of attacks either by the Syrian government or Isis. </p> <p>In 2015 the attempts ended in military disaster with the troops trained in Turkey either being killed by fighters from the al-Qaida-linked Jabhat al-Nusra, now known as Jabhat Fatah al-Sham, or else surrendering along with their new US-supplied equipment.</p> <p>The US reopened its train-and-equip programme in the summer. There have been reports that Barack Obama is still unwilling to agree to send further help including arms to moderates in Aleppo, partly because he fears they have become increasingly jihadist in their outlook.</p> <p>The reports suggest Obama has in essence aimed to defer any decisions, and leave them to his successor in the White House, so ensuring there is no new short-term counterbalance to the Syrian government advance.</p> <p>The MoD insists moderate fighters exist in north-western Syria, and denies they are all extremists. Fallon has described a moderate in the Syria context as someone \u201cprepared to live within a plural political settlement that can in the end be democratic and take Syria towards elections\u201d.</p> <p>The western coalition insists it has learned lessons from the 2015 debacle and is seeking to add to pre-existing armed factions in Syria, rather than form an entirely new western-backed grouping.</p> <p>Critics will question how the MoD can vet the moderates and ensure any skills learned through British training are not transferred away from the fight to defeat Isis. The struggle for Raqqa is diplomatically fraught since Moscow and the Syrian government regard it as their task to win back control of north-western Syria.</p> <p>Using a different term for Isis, Fallon insisted: \u201cDaesh are on the back foot. Now we\u2019re stepping up our support to moderate opposition forces in Syria, through training them in the skills they need to defeat Daesh.</p> <p>\u201cAs Iraqi and Kurdish forces close in on Mosul, the UK supported training will help cement recent progress in north-west Syria, underlining the pressure Daesh is now under on all fronts.</p> <p>\u201cAll volunteers from the moderate opposition will be subject to strict vetting procedures and will receive training in international humanitarian law. Trainees will be security and medically screened prior to the start of training and will be assessed during and monitored after training.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Online merchants are now rushing to open physical stores, as the ability of customers to touch and feel products becomes the latest competitive differentiator in a world where consumers are now utterly spoilt for choice.</p> <p>Earlier this year, online giant Amazon opened its first physical store in Seattle\u2019s University Village, YouTube opened its first \u2018Creator Store\u2019 in London and popular online menswear store Bonobos opened 10 stores this year.</p> <p>At the same time, traditional businesses are scrambling to build out their online presence. In Australia, several established brands have substantially amped up their digital presence, including book retailer Dymocks and leading supermarket chains Coles and Woolworths, while major Australian banks have also invested heavily in growing their online channels as new digital models disrupt their long-held market dominance.</p> <p>Lee Hawksley, Senior VP and GM of Salesforce Marketing Cloud JAPAC, said the bricks-and-mortar store is still the most important point of contact for any business that has one. And it might surprise many to learn that online sales globally account for just 10 percent of all consumer buying, with the proportion more like seven percent in Australia.</p> <p>Yet with online trade set to continue growing its share of the bigger pie, the hybrid retail model is emerging as the gold standard for delivering a truly great customer-centric experience that keeps people coming back.</p> <p>\u201cThere is an expectation retailers will know exactly who a customer is at every contact point, be that in physical stores, or online at any time and via any device,\u201d Hawksley says. \u201cCustomers want experiences that are relevant and frictionless.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Customers want experiences that are relevant and frictionless.</p> <footer> <cite>Lee Hawksley, Senior VP and GM of Salesforce Marketing Cloud JAPAC</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Pure online players now have new and promising opportunities to build more personalised and meaningful relationships with their customers. They also have the advantage of having amassed rich reservoirs of customer data to further hone their messages and deliver more targeted and responsive communications in-store.</p> <p>Meanwhile, traditional businesses are looking outwards to entirely new markets and new customers. Tapping into digital channels, including social media, also opens doors to establish new connections and collect market data to then feed back into improving both online and in-store experiences. </p> <p>Known as the \u2018unified customer experience\u2019, this strategy is centred around being able to identify the customer and access important data about them at every interaction, via any channel.</p> <p>In its essence, offering a unified customer experience means breaking down silos and harnessing data to ensure that each and every customer has a consistent experience across every touch point they have with a business.</p> <p>This means more than just ensuring all communications with customers have the same tone and style. It also means using data about a customer\u2019s demographics, preferences and order history to tailor their customer experience, regardless of whether their transaction is happening in the physical world or online.</p> <p>And online means wherever the customer happens to be. Salesforce\u2019s Empowered Shoppers Report found very high levels of smartphone ownership among Australian shoppers, at 78 percent of Baby Boomers, 89 percent of Gen Xers and 98 percent of Millennials. </p> <p>It also found 33 percent of shoppers saw the inability of merchants to support mobile interactions as reason enough to switch brands. And that proportion is only going to get larger as mobile devices assume a greater role in our lives.</p> <p>Meanwhile, in-store interactive touch screens, either on fixed digital kiosks or portable tablets, are becoming more commonplace, especially in retail. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"93757294a04b4cb038b195c30786dc27ed9e1f06\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/93757294a04b4cb038b195c30786dc27ed9e1f06/0_0_5130_3316/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Woman paying with smart watch in store\" width=\"1000\" height=\"646\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Meanwhile, in-store interactive touch screens, either on fixed digital kiosks or portable tablets, are becoming more commonplace, especially in retail.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ariel Skelley/Getty Images/Blend Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Tablets are being used to help retail customers find the right fit. For instance, some retailers are experimenting with 3D body scanners that collect and process large numbers of data points to create precise images. Then there are applications being used by grocery stores whereby tablets attached to shopping carts detect RFID (radio frequency identification) tags on products, triggering messages such as recipes related to a particular food item.</p> <p>Digital screens are also being integrated with technologies like QR codes, or near-field communication (NFC) for immediate access to information. Smartphone-coded tags let shoppers scan a coded tag on an item of clothing with a smartphone, then use the device to select colour and size, which then triggers an automated system to send the item directly to the customers\u2019 change room.</p> <p>Retailers in the US are also experimenting with digitally connected interactive hangers. With this technology, the simple act of a shopper picking a hanger off the rack can trigger preprogrammed visual media on nearby screens, or change the lighting and background music in a store.</p> <p>Augmented and virtual reality technologies are also looming large on the horizon. Both have potential to let customers view different products, colours and sizes from multiple perspectives and with information overlayed, while potentially sharing that information with friends \u2013 or colleagues \u2013 via social media.</p> <p>Combined, these trends mean that old fears about digital retailing supplanting bricks and mortar stores are misplaced. Rather than developing independently, the two spheres are beginning to trace a similar arc, en route to delivering unified customer experiences. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/salesforce-the-unfair-advantage/2016/oct/13/smarter-faster-brighter-business-in-an-ai-world\">Smarter, faster, brighter: business in an AI world</a> </p> </aside>  <p>For how this trajectory plays out, take Nordstrom, one of the oldest retailers in the US.

  "<p>The first Democrat and first woman to serve as Pennsylvania attorney general was sentenced to jail on Monday, completing a catastrophic fall from grace for a rising political star. <br></p> <p>Former Pennsylvania attorney general Kathleen Kane, once seen as a potential future governor, was convicted in August of two felony counts and seven misdemeanors in her perjury trial. She <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/16/pennsylvania-attorney-general-kathleen-kane-resigns\">resigned</a> from her position two days later, having served since 2013.</p> <p>Kane was sentenced to 10 to 23 months in jail and eight years of probation by a Montgomery County judge who said Kane\u2019s ego drove her to take down enemies and break the law. If Kane posts bond of $75,000 cash bail, she will remain free while she appeals her conviction.</p> <p>The jury at her criminal trial in August found her guilty of illegally leaking grand jury findings to the press to embarrass a political enemy. She then plotted a cover-up and lied about it under oath.</p> <p>Kane, 50, was convicted of two felony counts and seven misdemeanors in her perjury trial. She <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/16/pennsylvania-attorney-general-kathleen-kane-resigns\">resigned</a> from her position two days later, having served since 2013.</p> <p>Looking back at her swift downfall, Bruce Ledewitz, a law professor at Pittsburgh\u2019s Duquesne University said: \u201cThis illustrates once more, if anyone ever needed reminding, that the cover-up is worse than the crime.\u201d</p> <p>Kane could initially have gotten away with a slap on the wrist for the leak itself, he told the Guardian.</p> <p>\u201cThe grand jury leak would have been a minor embarrassment if she had gone to court and apologized. But instead she started covering up,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Kane\u2019s short reign was one of paradox.</p> <p>She became known for standing up for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/02/pennsylvania-bishops-hid-priest-sex-abuse-children\">victims of sexual violence</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/11/pennsylvania-attorney-general-aclu-gay-marriage-lawsuit\">defending</a> gay rights.</p> <p>And she took on a state criminal justice establishment she called the \u201cold boys\u2019 club\u201d, including a <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/pornographic-email-scandal-ripples-through-pennsylvania-politics/2015/12/26/fc411a76-a374-11e5-b53d-972e2751f433_story.html\">crackdown</a> after racist, sexist and pornographic emails were discovered being swapped on government computers.</p> <p>But she also developed a reputation for grandiosity, score-settling and show-boating, some observers noted.</p> <p>\u201cHer fall has been shocking. There was nothing on her track record to suggest that she was going to become corrupted by power. She came into that office as Bambi and turned into Richard Nixon overnight \u2013 seeking to get even with political foe,\u201d Ledewitz said.</p> <p>Judge Wendy Demchick-Alloy said during sentencing that Kane assumed an \u201coff with your heads\u201d mentality as she ran the state\u2019s top law enforcement agency. The judge called Kane a political \u201cneophyte\u201d who failed to make the transition from campaigner to public servant after she took office.</p> <p>\u201cThis case is about retaliation and revenge against perceived enemies who this defendant ... felt had embarrassed her in the press,\u201d Demchick-Alloy said.</p> <p>Kane campaigned for office pledging to investigate whether Republicans were dragging out the <a href=\"http://www.pennlive.com/midstate/index.ssf/2011/11/special_report_why_the_jerry_s.html\">slow process</a> of <a href=\"http://www.pennlive.com/midstate/index.ssf/2011/11/former_penn_state_coach_jerry.html\">indicting</a> Jerry Sandusky, for political reasons.</p> <p>The former Penn State football coach was eventually <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jun/23/jerry-sandusky-convicted-penn-state\">convicted</a> in 2012, found guilty of 45 counts of abusing young boys after a long grand jury probe had found crimes going back decades.</p> <p>No politically motivated delays in the case were ever proved, but Kane became embroiled in feuds with Republican governor Tom Corbett, Sandusky prosecutor Frank Fina and others.</p> <p>Fina ended up being the main target of the leak that sunk Kane. Over a <a href=\"http://www.politicspa.com/the-kathleen-kane-saga-a-timeline/65556/\">relatively short period</a>, her leadership became <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/08/16/how-racy-emails-and-a-grand-jury-leak-brought-down-a-political-rising-star/\">marred</a> by vendettas, <a href=\"http://www.pennlive.com/midstate/index.ssf/2015/11/the_boys_club_fights_back_form.html\">lawsuits</a> and leaks.</p> <p>Harrisburg-based attorney Walter Cohen, a former attorney general, said Kane\u2019s motives were often just but her execution was heavy-handed and her style became grandiose.</p> <p>\u201cShe started to believe all the great things people were saying about her and believed she was indestructible,\u201d Cohen said.</p> <p>Kane came under investigation in 2014.</p> <p>But even as the perjury case was closing in on her, her team was working hard behind the scenes on a secret grand jury investigation into pedophile priests.</p> <p>In the spring of 2016, Kane released a report exposing decades of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/08/catholic-priest-child-sex-abuse-ebensburg-pennsylvania\">\u201cmonstrous\u201d</a> child abuse by Roman Catholic priests in the Pennsylvania archdiocese of Altoona-Johnstown.</p> <p>A series of other Pennsylvania archdioceses are now similarly <a href=\"http://www.mcall.com/news/nationworld/pennsylvania/mc-pa-allentown-catholic-dioceses-priest-grand-jury-20160916-story.html\">under investigation</a>.</p> <p>Meanwhile Kane encouraged state lawmakers\u2019 attempts to lift the statute of limitations so that more <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/10/catholic-priest-child-abuse-suicide-brian-gergely\">victims</a> of child abuse could sue the church, despite those efforts being repeatedly thwarted by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/17/pennsylvania-catholic-church-sexual-abuse-bill-mafia-tactics\">pushback</a> from Catholic leaders.</p> <p>In 2015, Kane\u2019s law license was <a href=\"http://www.mcall.com/news/breaking/mc-pa-kathleen-kane--law-license-suspended-by-court-20150921-story.html\">suspended</a> and she was charged by Montgomery County district attorney Kevin Steele, the same prosecutor who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/06/bill-cosby-trial-date-sexual-assault-charges\">indicted Bill Cosby</a> for sexual assault.</p> <p>Ironically, with her trial looming in 2016, Kane hired a Republican prosecutor, Bruce Castor, to, essentially, stand in for her. He was best known for declining to prosecute Bill Cosby a decade ago and was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/21/bruce-castor-pennsylvania-bill-cosby-jerry-sandusky-cases\">perceived</a> by some as acting against the interests of victims of sexual violence.</p> <p>Castor <a href=\"http://articles.philly.com/2016-09-08/news/75312988_1_general-kathleen-g-kane-new-attorney-general\">left</a> shortly after Kane\u2019s conviction.</p> <p>A new attorney general will be elected in November.

  "<p>Is that it, already? The end of <a href=\"http://www.itv.com/hub/cold-feet/1a2292\"><strong>Cold Feet</strong></a> (ITV)? It\u2019s going out with a party, Adam\u2019s wrap-party for his 40s. What, it\u2019s only his 49th, he complains. Shut up, Adam, you\u2019re 50. And here\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/a-ha\">A-ha</a> to prove it. Plus the Eurythmics, Odyssey, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/abba\">Abba</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/bobmarley\">Bob Marley</a>, Sister Sledge and lots more age-appropriate dad-disco music.</p> <p>The party, arranged by will-they-won\u2019t-they Tina is the main timeframe for the episode, from which it dips repeatedly back into the recent past. Yo-yo TV, is the technical term. So here\u2019s Karen signing a hot new writer to her new publishing house. And celebrating with a huge advance (know what I mean) from her inappropriately young, it-was-meant-to-be-a-one-off, social-media partner.</p> <p>No such joy for Pete, who can\u2019t get it up. Poor Pete has had more than his fair share of the <em>issues</em> in Cold Feet 2.0 \u2013 depression, near mercy killing, suicide and now impotence. Hang on, David has a pill that can help with that, a little blue friend for his little blue friend. Whoa, now Pete\u2019s tentpoling like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/oct/14/billy-smart-circus-sea-lion-fritzy-fritzi-missing\">Billy Smart</a>. Not that Jenny\u2019s impressed. \u201cIt\u2019s not exactly flattering; that\u2019s chemically induced, that is,\u201d she says, pointing at it, at \u201cthat\u201d.</p> <p>David\u2019s happy at least. He\u2019s off the hook, twice; the law hook and the Robyn hook. She is letting him have his quickie \u2013 divorce, not the other kind. And he\u2019s going to celebrate, with proposal 2.0 to previous wife Karen. Trouble is, boring-snoring Eddie (go away, Eddie, just eff off) is, too! Karen gets two of them \u2013 proposals \u2013 within a minute; that has got to be some kind of record hasn\u2019t it? And she\u2019s clearly more interested in her Mr Retweet Me Anytime You Like Social Media. David and Dull Eddie end up rolling around on the floor together, not in an amorous way, just two old blokes trying \u2013 and failing \u2013 to have a fight.</p> <p>Young Josh is back from travelling, and gay. Ramona \u2013 remember, the Spanish nanny (Spanny?) from Cold Feet 1.0? \u2013 also returns, for the party.<br></p> <p>Adam tries to talk to Tina to tell her how he feels, but her boyfriend, Jamie, keeps interrupting. \u201cWhat football team do you support?\u201d United fan Adam asks him. \u201cChelsea,\u201d Jamie replies. Adam nods in a knowing, thought-so kind of way, which looks less good broadcast the day after a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/23/chelsea-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report\">four-nil drubbing</a>. Did they have the fixture list when this was made, I wonder?</p> <p>So Adam and Pete go to the offie to get more booze, and get caught up in a holdup. What? It\u2019s too much, and it has been a symptom of the series, sudden high melodrama moments like this, and Harry\u2019s near killing, plus Pete\u2019s near suicide. It\u2019s not necessary \u2013 Cold Feet should be confident enough in its characters and dialogue, its warmth and its wit, not to need these mad soap-opera moments. And it\u2019s not as if there isn\u2019t enough going on already, back at the party. Look, now the holdup is peacefully resolved (by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ban_Ki-moon\">Ban Ki-moon</a> Adam, mainly), Pete and Jenny are having a quickie in the loo \u2013 shag, not divorce. No need for pills; impotence, depression, feelings of worthlessness can be sorted with a comedy (and replica it turns out) gun pointed at your head.</p> <p>It could have been a disaster, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/aug/05/cold-feet-warms-up-for-return-to-tv-theres-a-great-need-for-nostalgia\">reboot of Cold Feet, 13 years on</a>. It hasn\u2019t been \u2013 the numbers have been dead impressive. Seven million viewers, in this age of about 6m ways of watching TV, aren\u2019t easy to come by. I\u2019ve enjoyed it \u2013 like going to a university reunion I was slightly dreading and not just being pleasantly surprised but actually having a really good time. Ah, yes, that\u2019s why these people \u2013 Adam, Karen, Pete, Jenny, David, as well as Cold Feet itself \u2013 were my friends back in the day. Maybe I have moved on, there are new friends now, different friends, but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/sep/05/cold-feet-review\">it was bloody good to catch up</a>. There will be another chance to next year \u2013 it has been recommissioned.</p> <p>For now, though, there are a few loose ends to tie up. On the terrace, the lights of night-time Manchester twinkling romantically below (and Marvin Gaye\u2019s Inner City Blues on the soundtrack), Jamie has brought a guitar to the party. \u201cWhat a wanker,\u201d says Adam, quite rightly, though it doesn\u2019t stop him borrowing it. Well, when the game is love, anything goes. He serenades Tina, plays the wanker card himself, and the Ballymena (rhymes with Tina) one, and let\u2019s-bond-over-bereavement.</p> <p>It is, as she says, truly awful. And embarrassing. And it totally works. Jamie, the wanker, is sent home. Adam gets the girl. Manchester United 1, Chelsea 0.</p>",
  "<p>The missing white stone head of baby Jesus has been returned to a Canadian church after its bright orange <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/20/canada-baby-jesus-head-statue-church-restoration\">replacement was widely mocked</a>.<br></p> <p>On Friday, an anonymous woman returned the original head to Sainte Anne des Pins Catholic church in downtown Sudbury,<a href=\"http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/sudbury/jesus-statue-head-returned-1.3817883\"> according to the CBC</a>. </p> <p>The head had been taken off the white stone statue of Mary holding the baby Jesus several times before, and left on the ground by vandals.

At 23, he is five years too old to be taken in under the Dublin regulation.</p> <p>\u201cI am six months here in the camp. My whole family, my brothers and sisters are living in the UK, and my nephews. I have no one in my country. So what I have to do, I have to join my family. But they say \u2018no, no\u2019 you are not a teenager. You should go back to your country.</p> <p>\u201cThey said I should apply for asylum. I am allowed to apply for asylum in France but I don\u2019t want, I want to rejoin my family in UK. My brother, sisters, sisters-in-law have been there for 20 years.</p> <p>\u201cI am an educated person.

And I understand, they are helpless. But I am helpless too.\u201d</p> <p>He said the challenges in the camp were a symptom of war and injustice that the west has had a part in.</p> <p>\u201cThere are 10,000 individuals in there, 10,000 minds in there. Each one of them has a story, has their individual problem, each one has their reason to be there. Some of them are crazy, sometimes there are fights. But you have to ask, what made them like that. No one wants to be in the jungle, no one.\u201d</p> <p>Referring to the squalor of the camp, the lack access to cooking facilities, to privacy, to education, he said: \u201cThis is a violation of human rights. The UK and France are responsible for this. This is an injustice.\u201d</p> <p>He spent $13,000 to get to France to be within what he thought was a whisker of his family, but now the devastation is writ large on his face as he heads to join the queues for the buses. \u201cI understand they want to help children and take them to the UK. but I am a human too.

They are worried France won\u2019t grant them asylum because it doesn\u2019t recognise them as persecuted, based on the experience of others who have been rejected.</em></p> <p><em>The U.N. refugee agency UNHCR said everyone in the Calais camp would be offered the chance to be transferred to a reception centre where they could apply for asylum. </em><em>\u201cThere will be no blanket decisions for certain nationalities,\u201d spokeswoman Laura Padoan said.</em></p> <p><em>French asylum chief Pascal Brice recently visited the Jungle and offered reassurances to the migrants and refugees, including the Oromo group, said Solan. </em><em>Brice was not available for comment when the Thomson Reuters Foundation contacted his office on Monday.</em></p> <p><em>\u201cIf they accept us we want to stay here (in France),\u201d said Solan, who did not want to give his full name. \u201cWe are not searching for a better country, we are here (in Calais) because England accepts Oromo people.\u201d</em></p> <p><em>Solan has been moving back and forth between Calais and a makeshift migrant camp in Paris for the past year, he said.

Under pressure from Britain, which sees it as having a \u201cpull\u201d effect on migration, the camp is closed in 2002. Hundreds of mainly Afghan migrants then set up camp east of Calais, on a patch of scrubland next to a road travelled by lorries heading for Calais port. The migrants call it \u201cthe Jungle\u201d.<br></li> <li>In <strong>September 2009</strong>, the Jungle is demolished for the first time on the orders of then president Nicolas Sarkozy, following a mass police raid in which scores of people are arrested.<br></li> <li>In <strong>early 2015</strong>, a new settlement - labelled the \u201cNew Jungle\u201d - sprouts up near a state-run day centre for migrants established at the site. The camp later becomes simply known as the Jungle. <br></li> <li>From <strong>mid-2015 on</strong>, migrants attempting to board lorries or enter the Channel Tunnel frequently clash with police around the camp, which mushrooms in size as asylum-seekers pour into Europe in unprecedented numbers. That November, France\u2019s top administrative court rapped the government over conditions in the camp, describing them as \u201cinhuman\u201d.<br></li> <li>In <strong>January 2016</strong>, the port of Calais is shut for more than three hours after dozens of migrants occupy a moored Britain-bound ferry. A month later, around 20 people are arrested in Calais at a banned rally by supporters of Germany\u2019s xenophobic Pegida movement.<br></li> <li>The southern half of the Jungle camp is demolished in late <strong>February 2016 and early March</strong>, sparking protests. Iranian migrants protesting at the destruction of their shacks sew their mouths shut. The evicted migrants moved to the northern part of the camp.<br></li> <li>On <strong>26 September</strong>, President Francois Hollande says the Jungle will be demolished by the end of the year and that the migrants - estimated to number around 6,000 - will be moved to shelters around the country.<br></li> <li>On <strong>October 21</strong> the interior ministry confirms the operation to tear down the camp will start on Monday, 24 October (today). Migrants began evacuating early in the morning, with the first bus carrying about 50 Sudanese leaving the Jungle at about 08:45 am (0645 GMT). <br></li> </ul> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-580de333e4b0c146d5891341\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-24T10:34:47.178Z\">11.34am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">600 people bussed away from Calais camp by 11.30am</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/achrisafis/status/790500129530908673\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">By 11:30, 600 refugees &amp; migrants had left by bus to places including burgundy, north eastern France, western France <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/calais?src=hash\">#calais</a></p>&mdash; Angelique Chrisafis (@achrisafis) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/achrisafis/status/790500129530908673\">October 24, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-10-24T10:35:04.270Z\">at 11.35am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-580de2ade4b0ce434eca471c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-24T10:31:36.233Z\">11.31am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Our reporters have arrived back at the processing queues and say that all is now calm in the area.

That\u2019s why it\u2019s right Britain should be doing its bit as well.\u201d</p> <p>She added: \u201cThere has to be a plan between both France and Britain to help the children and teenagers right now.

Once the clearances start, we know that there is a significant risk that many of those children and young people disappear. That is what happened last time when part of the camp was closed without a plan for the children and teenagers.</p> <p>\u201cAnd the consequence is they slip into the arms of the smuggler gangs, the traffickers.

  "<blockquote> <p>Dear Minister Keenan,<br>  Australia\u2019s gun control laws are the envy of the world. Since the landmark 1996 national firearms agreement (NFA) our state, territory and federal firearms laws have been focused on the goal of ensuring community safety. We believe that any review of the NFA must have direct input from gun control advocates and be focused on community safety.  The NFA only came about because of the courage of political leaders, especially former prime minister John Howard, in response to the tragedy of the mass shooting at Port Arthur in 1996. In the 20 years since Port Arthur, and the NFA that followed, Australia has not suffered another mass shooting. This is a clear case of good politics and genuine political leadership working to save lives. </p> </blockquote> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/oct/25/michael-keenan-criticised-for-holding-one-sided-meetings-with-gun-lobby\">Michael Keenan criticised for holding 'one-sided' meetings with gun lobby</a> </p> </aside>  <blockquote> <p>At present the Australian government is undertaking a review of the NFA. We support an unbiased review of the NFA that addresses any loopholes and weaknesses in the country\u2019s gun control laws. One weakness is the error in classifying the six shot Adler A110 shotgun as a category A rather than category C firearm. Related to this is the failure to make the temporary importation ban on the eight-shot Adler A110 permanent. However there are many other pressures on our gun control laws that deserve national attention.<br>  So it is with real concern that we see you have organised repeat official meetings to discuss changes to the NFA with the firearms industry and the pro-gun lobby in the form of the Firearms Industry Reference Group. At these meetings you have informed the gun lobby representatives that the review of the NFA is:  \u201c... an opportunity to simplify the national firearms agreement to assist the firearms community,\u201d and </p> <p>\u201c... the government is keen to simplify the regulations and the bureaucracy to lessen red tape for firearms users.\u201d<br>  The Firearms Industry Reference Group contains representatives from government departments and the Sporting Shooters\u2019 Association, the National Firearms Dealers Association, Shooting Australia and the Shooting Industry Foundation of Australia. It contains not a single gun control or community safety advocate. Unsurprisingly, these meetings ignore community safety issues and instead focus on watering down the NFA, importing more guns, increasing children\u2019s access to weapons and removing limits on firearms ownership.  If the review of the NFA is to retain credibility you must give at least equal access to gun control advocates. Gun violence can affect people in their relationships, their workplaces, their homes or the public domain. So it is essential you officially engage with representatives from the public health sector, criminologists, gun control advocates, unions, domestic violence workers and victim support groups. Given the enormous support in the community for our world-class gun control laws it is remarkable that these representatives are not already routinely engaged by your office in the review of the NFA.</p> <p>We look forward to hearing from you,<br></p> <p>Signed,<br></p> <p>1.

  "<p>Hundreds more refugee children are to be brought from Calais to Britain in the next three weeks but one in four local authorities in England, including Theresa May\u2019s own council, say they cannot take responsibility for them.<br></p> <p>As the French clearance operation got under way at the Calais refugee camp, the home secretary told MPs that 800 children claiming family links with Britain have been interviewed by Home Office officials in the camp in the past week.</p> <p>Amber Rudd said that almost 200 children have been brought to Britain in recent days, including 60 girls under the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/05/disgrace-to-europe-former-child-refugee-lord-dubs-calais-camp\">Dubs amendment</a>, which is designed to protect vulnerable child refugees across Europe. But 38 councils out of 156 in England have so far refused to take part in resettling those who have arrived.</p> <p>A total of 1,918 Calais camp residents, including 300 children, packed their bags and passed through the official registration centre on Monday, the French interior ministry said. A fleet of 46 buses started to take them to regions all over France, except Paris and Corsica, leaving an estimated 8,000 remaining in the camp waiting to be processed.</p> <p>Rudd told the Commons that Britain will not accept applications from anybody who has arrived in the Calais camp after today and that those to be brought to Britain will go through proper age assessment and security checks before they come.</p> <p>\u201cWe will only consider those present in the camps before the start of clearances [of the camp],\u201d the home secretary added. \u201cWe will continue to do this quickly, but it is essential that we carry out the proper safeguarding, age assessment and security checks, working closely with local authorities and social workers here in the UK, to ensure that the children are eligible, and that it is in their best interests to come.\u201d</p> <p>Many of those queuing to leave the camp were Sudanese and Eritrean in a largely orderly operation. As officers opened the gates, people were guided into four queues \u2013 adult, family, child and vulnerable or disabled \u2013 and given a coloured wristband. Among them, Mohamed, 23, from Eritrea, said he was happy to leave, adding: \u201cThe camp is dirty and dangerous.\u201d He had been there for three months, he told the Guardian, and had tried to get asylum in France before.</p> <p>\u201cMy fingerprints were taken in Italy and wherever you go in Europe after that they say you have to go back to Italy under the Dublin regulation.

They will be taken to containers within a secure area of the camp previously used to house adults. But conflicting advice over where children should go was \u201cextremely distressing and confusing\u201d to those who were struggling to understand where they should go and how they were supposed to get there, according to the charity Help Refugees. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u201cUp to a thousand children are expected to be housed in the shipping containers and at present it appears there is nothing in the way of youth workers to be responsible for, and help calm, these young people and children,\u201d Help Refugees said.</p> <p>However, the Home Office said it had temporarily suspended the transfer of children from Calais to the UK on Monday at the request of the French authorities as they started preparations to clear the camp. </p> <p>Britain is to spend \u00a336m to help the French authorities ensure that the closure of the Calais camp \u2013 which has been a focus of charitable and humanitarian efforts \u2013 is \u201cfull and lasting\u201d and that it does not simply reappear in a few months time. This money includes \u00a314m on security at the port.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>By nightfall on Monday, French interior minister Bernard Cazeneuve said 1,918 people had been processed and sent to 80 centres around France. Another 400 unaccompanied minors were being housed in heated shelters at the camp.</p> <p>The operation, expected to last a week, would continue as long as necessary, Cazeneuve said. \u201cThis is an operation we want to be peaceful and under control. So far it is,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Rudd appealed to local authorities to come forward and volunteer to take more children under the Dubs amendment, saying there were not yet enough places. One of the councils that has refused to take any lone children from Calais is Windsor and Maidenhead council, which covers Theresa May\u2019s constituency. \u201cThe Royal Borough is currently taking in four children under the Syrian resettlement programme and has committed to house another eight Syrian refugee families. We are not able to take further people at this point,\u201d said a spokesperson.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>According to the magazine Children and Young People Now, three of the nine regional local authority areas have not signed up to the national transfer scheme under which the Dubs amendment children will be housed in Britain. The Home Office has refused to reveal which regions have not signed up but Leicestershire county council became the latest to refuse to take part.</p> <p>The last minute nature of the Home Office\u2019s response, coming as the camp was in the process of being cleared by the French authorities, was underlined by the disclosure by the Local Government Association that the home secretary and the children\u2019s minister only wrote to council leaders on 14 October asking them if they were willing to accept the Dubs children on a voluntary basis.</p> <p>Citizens UK spokesman George Gabriel said the suspension of further transfers to Britain was disappointing: \u201cWe hope that the progress made in the last week will resume tomorrow. The Home Office must not allow vulnerable children to fall back into the hands of people smugglers because of avoidable delays.\u201d</p> <p>In the Commons the shadow home secretary, Diane Abbott, accused the home secretary of treating the Calais refugees as pawns and hiding behind the French authorities for her failure to identify those eligible to come to Britain far sooner. She said the demolition of the camp should have been postponed until the position of the child refugees had been properly safeguarded.</p> <p>Yusef, 35, a pharmacist from Sudan who spent three months living rough in Calais, and said that he hoped to claim asylum in France, said he had no idea where he would end up: \u201cI will close my eyes and put my finger on the map.\u201d</p> <p>But he was optimistic. \u201cI want to integrate to start a new life, contribute. I trust France to keep me safe.\u201d Once he had hopes of making it to the UK. \u201cBut that dream died here,\u201d he said. \u201cThat bridge is closed.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>A high court judge has intervened to prevent a Metropolitan police inspector charged with two criminal offences from retiring at midnight on Monday to avoid disciplinary proceedings and the loss of his full pension.</p> <p>The inspector, who cannot be named for legal reasons, is charged with actual bodily harm and perverting the course of justice. </p> <p>The charges relate to an alleged incident that took place at a football match in 2011. His criminal trial is due to take place early next year. </p> <p>The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) recommended that he face disciplinary proceedings for gross misconduct in relation to the criminal charges. But the inspector said he was going to retire, which would have allowed him to avoid the disciplinary proceedings and keep his full pension. <br></p> <p>Metropolitan police deputy assistant commissioner Fiona Taylor agreed that he could retire without facing disciplinary proceedings and he was due to retire at midnight on Monday.</p> <p>His alleged victim went to the high court on Monday afternoon to try to prevent him from retiring and avoiding disciplinary proceedings.</p> <p>Mr Justice Wilkie ruled that he should not retire on Monday and said that his retirement should not take effect until there has been a further court hearing to examine the issues relating to the officer\u2019s plan to retire and thus avoid gross misconduct proceedings. </p> <p>Tony Murphy of Bhatt Murphy Solicitors, who represents the inspector\u2019s alleged victim, said: \u201cIt is not acceptable for officers to evade accountability by retiring whilst under investigation. My client has been deeply affected as a result of his treatment by this officer. He hopes that this case will clarify the law and protect other members of the public.\u201d</p> <p>The inspector submitted his application to retire on 5 September 2016. </p> <p>The IPCC supported Monday\u2019s legal challenge to try to prevent the inspector from retiring on Monday night.</p> <p>A spokesman said: \u201cThe IPCC believes that officers should not be able to avoid disciplinary proceedings by retiring while under investigation or facing proceedings in circumstances which could result in dismissal. The decision whether to suspend officers or to allow them to retire can only be taken by a police force. The IPCC strongly supported changes to the law introduced last year, which prevent officers resigning when the investigation could lead to their dismissal from the force. Further planned legislative change, also supported by the IPCC, will mean that officers can still face disciplinary proceedings after retirement in some circumstances.\u201d</p> <p>A Metropolitan police service spokesman said: \u201cThe MPS has taken the decision not to suspend the inspector in order to prevent him from retiring.</p> <p>\u201cAs the inspector is facing criminal proceedings he will be held to account for his alleged actions during the course of the court case, meaning he will not escape sanction by retiring.</p> <p>\u201cIf the officer is acquitted at court then any potential disciplinary proceedings would essentially be considering the same allegations that had already been determined in his favour. Therefore there is no certainty that the officer would face misconduct proceedings. </p> <p>\u201cDecisions of this nature are made on the specific circumstances of each case and are not taken lightly. The decision must be proportionate, balancing a range of considerations.\u201d</p> <p>If the inspector had been allowed to retire on Monday night he would have received a six-figure lump sum for his pension along with annual payments \u2013 he has 30 years\u2019 service and is entitled to an annual sum of two-thirds of his current \u00a354,963 salary. For now that pension payout is on hold.</p>",
  "<p>Getting out of the EU without precipitating a constitutional crisis is going to be a severe test of the UK\u2019s politicians and the political arrangements in which they operate. It will require tact, diplomacy, patience, and a willingness to try to reach a consensus. So far, there is little evidence of any of these qualities. Most of the blame for that must fall on the prime minister, since although all the participants \u2013 the leaders of the devolved assemblies and the UK parliament \u2013 have a role in this unprecedented process, she sets the tone: so far, it has been confrontational. She has little alternative but to accept the result, and to play for time while Whitehall works out what needs doing and in what order. But she has sounded high-handed on a hard Brexit, on engaging with parliament and now on the role of the devolved administrations that could lead, all too easily, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/24/theresa-may-constitutional-crisis-brexit-deal-institute-for-government\" title=\"\">to the break-up of the United Kingdom</a>.</p> <p>Today\u2019s meeting of the joint ministerial committee of the leaders of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland with Theresa May and her ministers \u2013 not only the first since the referendum, but the first for nearly two years \u2013 was an indication of how quickly it could all go wrong. After a morning of \u201crobust\u201d discussion, the first ministers emerged complaining about the government\u2019s lack of transparency and its failure to make any concessions on their key demand of continuing access to the single market. While much of this is predictable and not entirely unrelated to domestic considerations, it underlines the importance \u2013 as a new <a href=\"http://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/publications/four-nation-brexit\" title=\"\">report from the Institute for Government</a> explains in detail \u2013 of reaching common positions as a basis for future negotiations with Brussels, through teamwork between Whitehall officials and the devolved administrations. London too should be part of this process; the absence of a specifically English regional voice is a weakness. A negotiation that goes as far as possible to reach a position that leavers and remainers can both accept is essential.</p> <p>Behind the bold simplicities of freedom of movement, the single market and free trade lurk a thousand variables that have different effects on different parts of the UK. Trade in particular, which once merely meant tangible goods, is now a huge and complex area that embraces intellectual property, public service procurement, financial and other services. The continuing crisis over Ceta, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/24/belgium-eu-ultimatum-canada-trade-deal-ceta-wallonia\" title=\"\">the Canadian trade deal </a>with the EU that was a decade in the making, is a reminder of how easily it can all go wrong. The power that two of Belgium\u2019s regional bodies exploited last week to veto the deal because of concerns over the impact of globalisation on jobs and the power that it gives to corporations to sue nation states, was only conceded by Brussels in order to try to ensure democratic legitimacy. It is easy to imagine a similar revolt against a Brexit deal: that is, after all, what the leavers\u2019 slogan of taking back control implies.</p> <p>There is another reason why Mrs May must make a priority of working for consensus \u2013 certainly much more than she has so far \u2013 between the four nations. If she does not, she will collide with the complications of a series of overlapping mandates that arise from the failure to include a \u201cdual majority\u201d clause in the EU referendum act. That would have required all four nations of the UK to have majorities in order to overturn the status quo; it would have avoided the situation faced now where Scotland and Northern Ireland, each with their own electoral legitimacy, demand that the terms of the negotiation recognise that they are faced with seriously damaging consequences from a decision that their voters rejected.</p> <p>Mrs May\u2019s response so far is to insist that her government alone controls the process. Technically, she is right both about negotiating withdrawal from the EU, and about the established relations with the devolved assemblies: neither trade nor international relations are devolved matters. However, typically of Britain\u2019s constitutional arrangements, the relationship between devolved and non-devolved matters often turns out to be a matter of negotiation. And the politics of it are likely to privilege the devolved bodies, not least because much of the detail of the Brexit negotiations \u2013 on fisheries, food, farming and the environment, for example \u2013 are of intense concern to them.</p> <p>Pressed again on her negotiating strategy and the role of parliament in its formulation, Mrs May repeated in the Commons this afternoon that there would be no running commentary. This is a recipe for confrontation that could lead to a constitutional crisis. It will take a policy of transparency and a search for consensus to avert it.</p>",
  "<p>The decision of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/oct/24/born-again-christian-ashers-bakery-lose-court-appeal-in-gay-cake-row\" title=\"\">the court of appeal in Belfast</a> in the case of Ashers bakery cannot be welcomed by anyone who cares about free speech. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/mar/26/what-is-belfasts-gay-cake-case\" title=\"\">Briefly</a>, a gay couple asked a Christian bakery to make them a cake showing Bert and Ernie from Sesame Street with a message praising equal marriage. The bakery refused, saying the message was contrary to the clear teaching of the Bible. The couple sued, claiming they had been discriminated against on the grounds of their sexual orientation. The bakers, in turn, felt discriminated against for their religious beliefs. If the case is understood as one that sets religious rights against sexual orientation then the decision against the bakers is understandable. There cannot be a blanket exemption against discrimination law because some people feel their conscience compels them to act unjustly. Although it is invidious to have to choose between religious and sexual identity, the law should, when in doubt, protect sexual minorities over religious ones.</p> <p>But that is not the only way in which this question can be examined. We may well think that Ashers bakery are bigots or fundamentalists but the other principle at issue is one of free speech. The law against discrimination says that they may not refuse service to anyone because of their sexual orientation. That\u2019s entirely right. It is further arguable that they should not be able to discriminate against anyone because of their political views. But what is at stake here \u2013 as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/feb/01/gay-cake-row-i-changed-my-mind-ashers-bakery-freedom-of-conscience-religion\" title=\"\">Peter Tatchell has pointed out</a> \u2013 is also a principle of free speech. They were being asked to make a statement in favour of gay marriage with which they profoundly disagreed. And here they ought to have had the right to disagree.</p> <p>It may seem that writing in icing on a cake is a trivial form of expression compared to, say, writing in a national newspaper. But it is still the clear expression of an opinion, and that is something that should not be compelled any more than it should be suppressed. The medium does not here affect the message. Suppose the bakery had been approached to produce a cake iced with the old Paisleyite slogan \u201cSave Ulster from Sodomy\u201d. Most decent people would applaud a refusal to reproduce such bigotry. Yet from the perspective of free speech, the principle is exactly the same. If free speech is not the right to be wrong it means nothing at all. Everyone has the right to their opinion but there is no right to compel other people to amplify or even reproduce it.</p> <p>As a matter of law, the situation in Northern Ireland is more complicated. For historical reasons there are very tight restrictions on the exercise of speech there if it might be used to whip up hatred. It\u2019s possible that in the fevered atmosphere around equal rights in which the cake was commissioned, the bakers\u2019 rejection of the commission did strike the couple involved as an attack on their own integrity. There ought to be a right not to be bullied, even if there isn\u2019t, and there shouldn\u2019t be any <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2006/feb/13/mondaymediasection7\" title=\"\">right not to be offended</a>. Free speech absolutism too often extends to a defence of bullying even when it is not defending direct incitement to hatred or violence, as many women who have ventured an opinion online have discovered. What makes this case importantly different is that it involved an attempt to compel someone to express \u2013 even in sugar paste \u2013 an opinion they rejected with all their hearts. That\u2019s wrong even when the opinion is right.</p>",
  "<p>For Yann Kermorgant, on Tuesday night at the Emirates Stadium his professional career will come somewhat full circle. The Reading striker is a former team-mate of Olivier Giroud in France\u2019s second division and remains close enough to the 30-year-old to exchange texts and take occasional tickets to watch him at Arsenal. In the EFL Cup the pair are in line to go head to head for the first time.</p> <p>If the reunion sounds an unlikely one from their respective time at Grenoble, it is remarkable that Kermorgant has been able to play professionally at all. At the age of 14, while on the books of the Rennes academy after leaving family and home comforts behind in Brittany, the Frenchman was diagnosed with leukaemia and told by doctors that his career was finished before it had started. Kermorgant underwent two years of treatment and did not kick a ball for the next four.</p> <p>\u201cI was told I was not supposed to play football again, that I would struggle to run and even to walk,\u201d Kermorgant says. \u201cBut I got better and better and I started to play football for fun with my friends. I was still a student and I was not thinking about playing properly again. After I started to feel better but I was not in the right place to do so. I needed to move somewhere outside the cocoon of my family and friends and everything. I gave myself a year to see if I could succeed and if not, I would carry on with my studies.\u201d</p> <p>Kermorgant never looked back. After juggling his degree in sports science and sports management at the University of Rennes with playing for his hometown club Vannes, he joined the fourth-tier club Ch\u00e2tellerault. His form there \u2013 hitting double figures over the course of the season \u2013 earned him a professional contract with Grenoble, the Ligue 2 club, at the age of 24. At the same time, a young Giroud was maturing after coming through the club\u2019s academy.</p> <p>\u201cWe played together a long time ago now,\u201d recalls Kermorgant. \u201cI played a few games with him over one season but not many because he came from the academy, he was young and after he went on loan.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"57fe3c6a76192184eb46155086e94786606a67d1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/57fe3c6a76192184eb46155086e94786606a67d1/55_152_4121_2472/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Olivier Giroud has been struggling with a persistent toe injury and has hardly figured for Arsenal so far this season.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Olivier Giroud has been struggling with a persistent toe injury and has hardly figured for Arsenal so far this season.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Giroud would impress on loan at Istres before joining Tours in 2008.

He moved to Charlton Athletic and then Bournemouth while Giroud joined Arsenal after two free-scoring years with Montpellier.</p> <p>A decade has now passed since Kermorgant and a baby-faced, beardless Giroud would practise shooting drills at the foot of the French Alps.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s funny because I always try \u2026 not to protect him but to tell people to stop saying he\u2019s not good enough because they shouldn\u2019t have this stance,\u201d Kermorgant says, asked about the criticism levelled at the France striker. \u201cIt\u2019s always the same for strikers but even more for the French. You get stick every time you do not score or get stick if the team does not win. Maybe it\u2019s also because of his style of play as a target man, maybe he\u2019s not the quickest striker but he\u2019s got different abilities and strength. He proves he\u2019s a really good striker by scoring 15-plus goals every season.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2016/oct/25/arsene-wenger-says-arsenal-have-tense-league-cup-history-with-reading-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/5954n\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2838128\"            data-video-name=\"Ars\u00e9ne Wenger says Arsenal have tense League Cup history with Reading \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"SNTV\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-580f2b35e4b08d944ba4a465\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/10/25/161025Arsenal_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/10/25/161025Arsenal.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/10/25/161025Arsenal_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2016/oct/25/arsene-wenger-says-arsenal-have-tense-league-cup-history-with-reading-video\">Ars\u00e9ne Wenger says Arsenal have tense League Cup history with Reading</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>\u201cI text him quite often: when he scores, when there\u2019s a big game or when he has been criticised for something.

The advert and the pills are part of <a href=\"http://www.artesmundi.org/artists/nastio-mosquito\">N\u00e1stio Mosquito</a>\u2019s contribution to <a href=\"http://www.artesmundi.org/en/exhibitions-prizes\">Artes Mundi 7</a>, which opened last Friday at both Chapter and the National Museum of Wales. The Angolan artist is one of six contenders for the \u00a340,000 prize, awarded every two years to an artist whose work engages \u201cwith the human condition, social reality and lived experience\u201d. Now there\u2019s a thing. When asked about the exhibition\u2019s remit, Welsh contender Bedwyr Williams <a href=\"https://elephantmag.com/artes-mundi-7-bedwyr-williams/\">told Elephant magazine</a>, \u201cI\u2019m a human and I make work about other humans.\u201d </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1aa25fbda181103ba7748935b9ea9dbab330d9f0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1aa25fbda181103ba7748935b9ea9dbab330d9f0/0_204_4000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"N\u00e1stio Mosquito\u2019s The Transitory Suppository at Artes Mundi 7\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">N\u00e1stio Mosquito\u2019s The Transitory Suppository at Artes Mundi 7.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Polly Thomas/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/oct/28/artes-mundi-cardiff-review-omer-fast-theaster-gates\">Last time</a>, Chicago artist and social activist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/apr/28/theaster-gates-freedom-of-assembly-white-cube-london-review\">Theaster Gates</a> won, sharing his winnings among his fellow contenders, including Icelandic artist Ragnar Kjartansson, whose wonderful film <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5Nkwoq9ybc\">The Visitors</a> was getting its British premier in Penarth. It felt as if the prize had come of age. Suppositories notwithstanding, I doubt Mosquito will win. His show looks bleak, but is worth hanging around for. A video plays on an old monitor bolted high on the wall of a room scattered with plastic chairs and empty beer bottles, as if some kind of party has been abandoned. The video is very funny, if a bit laboured, a fly-on-the-wall rehearsal of a speech being worked on by AL Moore, despotic and openly criminal and corrupt contender for the presidency of the fictional country of Botrovia. We watch him being presidential, and working on his speech in the lavatory. Reaming out the country\u2019s assets, profiting from drug deals, colluding with multinationals and intimidating opponents are Moore\u2019s stock in trade. This is the human condition, all right.</p> <p>Also at Chapter, and in the National Museum, <a href=\"http://www.artesmundi.org/artists/lamia-joreige\">Lamia Joreige</a> takes us on a filmed tour of Beirut, focusing on a canalised river that drains through the city in a valley of concrete. Joreige interviews residents and Syrian construction workers who came here to escape Isis. The camera travels the dried-up concrete bed and the accumulated rubbish. In her installation at the National Museum of Wales, Joreige also covers one wall with a list of hundreds of objects missing from the National Museum of Beirut, lost, looted or destroyed. The huge graphic display allows one to grasp the scale of the losses \u2013 sarcophagi and sphinxes, Iron and Bronze Age busts and Phoenician antiquities, and a pharaoh\u2019s offering to the gods. They\u2019ve gone down the river, who knows where.<br></p> <p>John Akomfrah\u2019s film Auto da F\u00e9, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/jan/25/john-akomfrah-vertigo-sea-bristol-arnolfini-london-lisson-gallery-auto-de-fe-the-airport-tropikos\">which I reviewed</a> earlier this year, is one of a number of recent works by the artist that collapse space and time in their examinations of diaspora and escape. While Joreige\u2019s displaced Syrians bring present plights into sharp focus in a few words, Akomfrah\u2019s recent films, with their wooden, static and self-conscious costume tableaux, may be gorgeous to look at but promise more than they deliver. Hugely talented, he feels a bit stuck to me, and the work does not improve on second viewing.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"64e88f281b0d5c7fc9c119159ab646fb7d97ff6b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/64e88f281b0d5c7fc9c119159ab646fb7d97ff6b/1127_0_2408_2667/903.jpg\" alt=\"Amy Franceschini and Futurefarmers\u2019 Seed Journey at Artes Mundi 7\" width=\"903\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Amy Franceschini and Futurefarmers\u2019 Seed Journey at Artes Mundi 7.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Polly Thomas</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>American artist <a href=\"http://www.artesmundi.org/artists/amy-franceschinifuturefarmers\">Amy Franceschini and Futurefarmers</a> undertake real, present journeys. Collecting grain used to make flatbread from numerous sources (from an archaeological dig in Norway, and seed saved during the siege of Leningrad), Franceschini and Futurefarmers have travelled from Oslo to Cardiff by sail, the first stage in a journey by sea back to the Middle East, where the cultivated grains originated. Along the way they make contact with bakers and farmers and make flatbread, documenting and retracing journeys that have been made for thousands of years. </p> <p>As an exhibition, all this is deadly boring, however worthy the idea. \u201cBy working collaboratively,\u201d we are told, Franceschini and Futurefarmers \u201cvisualise and understand the way systems interact and control our everyday lives and begin to question and deconstruct social systems such as food policies, public transportation and rural farming networks.\u201d Well, OK. Wooden boxes filled with seeds, displays of ears of grain, a little model boat and a banner hanging over the display like a primitive sail don\u2019t make for art that is interesting to look at. It is all a terribly dry way to make a point about what cultures share, and how they develop. This is social art at its most earnest and dull. There\u2019s not even any bread to share.<br></p> <p>The frustrations of looking at <a href=\"http://www.artesmundi.org/artists/neil-beloufa\">Ne\u00efl Beloufa</a>\u2019s work, however interesting or fun the ideas, also outweigh the positives. Getting Ukrainian teenagers to play a version of the board game Monopoly, trading on the country\u2019s assets, and displaying the film on a horizontal screen, and showing a film of another role-playing exercise, in which participants discuss the world\u2019s problems and find ever more extreme solutions, might be a fascinating exercise, but he makes it deliberately impossible to follow. The screen travels backwards and forwards on a length of track, and the videoed interactions are projected on to a surface that is covered with protuberances and hollows, as rough as a mountainside. It distorts everything, and makes looking at the imagery and reading the subtitles all but impossible. I guess this is a metaphor, or something.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9038f6f326e15c2d92df89457968920711104e29\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9038f6f326e15c2d92df89457968920711104e29/0_84_4000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ne\u00efl Beloufa\u2019s Monopoly at Artes Mundi 7\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ne\u00efl Beloufa\u2019s Monopoly at Artes Mundi 7.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Polly Thomas</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Give me, instead, an ice-skater and a chiropodist, making love somewhere in a brand new city, built on the mountainsides of Cadair Idris in north Wales. Vast and dizzying towers climb the mountains, oblivious to the terrain. A cruise ship is docked on the lake in the hollow. Sunlight shafts in between glowering clouds. The day passes and lights come on in the tower blocks, the primordial night illuminated. Music soars. This is more like it. This brave new world is the vision of an architect so shy he wouldn\u2019t even sing in his own car. It is a city so new, wrote one critic, \u201cI have fillings in my teeth older than this.\u201d </p> <p>I know all this because Bedwyr Williams recounts the story as a voice-over to the huge projected image, a digitally enhanced version of the kind of matte paintings on glass that until recently provided the impossible backdrops and terrains in movies. Where painters like <a href=\"http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/wilson-llyn-y-cau-cader-idris-n05596\">Richard Wilson</a> and <a href=\"http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/turner-landscape-with-cader-idris-d01873\">JMW Turner</a> amplified the magnificence of Cadair Idris in watercolour and oils, technology can do it bigger and better.</p> <p>Wind ruffles the lake, the weather comes and goes, sunlight smears a futuristic tower, a mast on the mountaintop winks in the looming dusk. Williams, telling the story of the city, ranges from the profound to the absurd. Tyrrau Mawr is the stand-out work of Artes Mundi. It is stirring and awful, tragic and hilarious. Pity the architect, killed by a jet of liquid concrete, in a building accident at the Spa and Wellness Centre. Filled with stories and alienated inhabitants, the city never sleeps.</p> <p>If German artist Hito Steyerl had not unavoidably pulled out of the exhibition at a late stage, the current Artes Mundi would feel a lot stronger. As it is, Williams really deserves to win, not because he is Welsh, but because his is the most consummately successful and engaging work here. It really stays with me. And, like Mosquito\u2019s work, it cuts through all that talk of the human condition and social worth. <br></p> <ul> <li>At <a href=\"http://www.chapter.org/artesmundi7\">Chapter arts centre</a> and the <a href=\"https://museum.wales/cardiff/whatson/9102/Artes-Mundi-7/\">National Museum of Wales</a>, Cardiff, until 26 February 2017.</li> </ul>",
  "<p>There are two reasons that Northern Ireland is a particularly pungent place for Andres Serrano to show his Torture pictures, currently <a href=\"http://www.derryvoid.com/\">on view at Void in Derry</a>. One is the violent history of the Troubles. The other is the Christian imagery that haunts the artist.</p> <p>In Serrano\u2019s notorious image <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piss_Christ#/media/File%3APiss_Christ_by_Serrano_Andres_(1987).jpg\">Piss Christ</a>, a crucifix is suspended in a tank of orange urine. When it was made in 1987, Northern Ireland was in the midst of something that resembled a civil war. Protestants fought Catholics and the IRA fought the British army. Altogether, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/troubles\">3,600 people were killed in the Troubles</a> between 1968 and 1998, when the Good Friday agreement began today\u2019s peace. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"55cb9c25da08d4732af8eea506cfbc798366194a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/55cb9c25da08d4732af8eea506cfbc798366194a/0_0_3284_3990/823.jpg\" alt=\"Transcending any one cause or crime \u2026 Untitled XII.\" width=\"823\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Transcending any one cause or crime \u2026 Untitled XII.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andres Serrano</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Since 1998, political violence has become a lot rarer in Northern Ireland, but the horrors of terror and torture have scarcely vanished from the world. Serrano started staging photographs about modern torture when he was commissioned to <a href=\"http://www.a-political.org/projects/andres-serrano/torture/\">create a cover on this theme for the New York Times Magazine in 2005</a>. His image of a face <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/imagepages/2005/06/09/magazine/12cover.1.html\">hidden by a horrific black hood</a> illustrated an essay about the torture of prisoners by US personnel at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/sep/20/usa.iraq\">Abu Ghraib</a> prison in Iraq. In 2015 he returned to this disturbing subject in a series of pictures made with survivors of torture. The participants in Serrano\u2019s Torture series have been tortured in real life. Courageously, they allow him to recreate their sufferings by posing in baroque staged versions of their ordeal. </p> <p>Among the participants are some of Northern Ireland\u2019s \u201chooded men\u201d. In 1971, as the Irish Times and others have reported, as British panic over the crisis in Northern Ireland grew, <a href=\"http://www.irishtimes.com/news/crime-and-law/the-torture-centre-northern-ireland-s-hooded-men-1.2296152\">14 men were taken to a British army site</a> on an old airfield at Ballykelly in County Derry. They were made to wear hoods and, the survivors claim, subjected to systematic torture.</p> <p>\u201cSometimes the hood would be lifted and there was this figure in silhouette firing questions and abuse \u2013 telling you your wife had done filthy, terrible things and your kids were in care,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-25139360\">Liam Shannon</a>, one of the hooded men, told the Irish Times. \u201cI was sure they were going to kill me anyway, so I just said, \u2018Aye, dead on.\u2019\u201d These experiences are restaged in Serrano\u2019s pictures, with the participation of some of the hooded men themselves.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8d9b18c02a38c24dc58b8bd42d57a4facecdf9cb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8d9b18c02a38c24dc58b8bd42d57a4facecdf9cb/0_0_4937_6000/823.jpg\" alt=\"Francie McGuigan, from the Hooded Men series of pictures.\" width=\"823\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Francie McGuigan, from the Hooded Men series of pictures.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andres Serrano</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Serrano\u2019s pictures at Derry\u2019s Void gallery are not just echoes of a troubled past but acts of witness in a dispute that is far from over. The men interrogated by the British army in 1971 are campaigning to have their treatment recognised as torture at the European court of human rights. In April this year, their lawyers accused Theresa Villiers, then the Northern Ireland secretary, of <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-35980913\">deliberately holding back documents that could help them</a>. Amnesty International <a href=\"http://www.amnesty.eu/en/news/press-releases/eu/torture/uk-ireland-landmark-hooded-men-torture-case-should-be-re-opened-0811/#.WA3qMut4WrU\">has called for their case to be reopened</a>. Clearly Serrano still has the nose for trouble that he did when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/apr/03/andres-serrano-interview-donald-trump-piss-christ\">he created Piss Christ</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"e12c7b2d54574a6aedd1daf50937f4ccf778821f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e12c7b2d54574a6aedd1daf50937f4ccf778821f/0_0_3333_4033/826.jpg\" alt=\"Another shot from the series.\" width=\"826\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Yet his images of hooded torture victims transcend any one cause or crime. The hoods make these frail human bodies look anonymous and universal. Helpless and naked before the camera, they <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crucifixion_of_St._Peter_(Caravaggio)#/media/File%3AMartirio_di_San_Pietro_September_2015-1a.jpg\">resemble saints in baroque paintings</a>. Serrano\u2019s depiction of a suffering that extends from Derry in 1971 to the political dungeons of today is both a call for justice and a compassionate portrayal of the human plight \u2013 our tragic embodiment, born to suffer, born to die.</p> <p>As for the Troubles, they are not over in the minds of people from all sides and communities who saw and suffered them. Now that Brexit has transformed every aspect of British nationhood, some fear that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/video/2016/oct/20/bands-of-brothers-could-brexit-bring-the-troubles-back-to-northern-ireland-video\">Northern Ireland\u2019s peace process may even be in danger</a>.

And that\u2019s the major problem here \u2013 the person who did this is supposed to be the hero of the piece and there will be no comeuppance for him forcing himself on her.

The BBC received 17 complaints about the scene and seven people also complained to OfCom. </p> <p>But Poldark writer Debbie Horsfield said that in the original Poldark books, written by Winston Graham, the scene was left up to the reader\u2019s imaginations. They consulted with Graham\u2019s son Andrew, who described the moment as \u201cconsensual sex born of long-term love and longing\u201d.</p> <p>Horsfield added: \u201cWhat you saw onscreen is consistent with what we believe those intentions to have been.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/oct/24/poldark-rape-scene-prettifying-it-doesnt-make-it-ok-elizabeth-said-no\">Prettifying the Poldark rape doesn't make it OK. Elizabeth said no</a> </p> </aside>  <p>However, Holdsworth said if Horsfield had intended on the encounter being consensual, she should have \u201cmade it clear that from the minute Elizabeth throws open the door that she wanted him there\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWhat I am left asking myself is why did she [Horsfield] write it like that?\u201d she said. \u201cElizabeth makes it clear she doesn\u2019t want him there, she tells him not to come into the room. Her line, \u2018You wouldn\u2019t dare\u2019 could be seen as a provocation, and the whole context of it is that she provoked him into it, she sent a letter that wound him up. </p> <p>\u201cBut that\u2019s very dangerous territory to get into, the idea that a woman will drive a man to a point where he can\u2019t control his baser instincts. That\u2019s an argument we\u2019re hearing in more modern cases and it doesn\u2019t wash. So, in a modern context, it\u2019s rape, cut and dried.\u201d</p> <p>For Holdworth, the programme\u2019s ambiguous approach to sexual consent was indicative of a wider problem in UK television, and particularly in period dramas, where violence against women is seen as the norm.</p> <p>She said: \u201cIt speaks to a bigger problem on British television that we\u2019re obsessed with period TV, because it sells incredibly well but women rarely come out of it well, and it is usually told from a very male perspective. It\u2019s problematic and we have to start looking at this stuff and say: \u2018Wouldn\u2019t it be lovely if the sexual agency could lie with the woman\u2019?\u201d</p>",

  "<p>Feted as the final piece in an expensively assembled jigsaw in the summer and pilloried as a lavish disappointment barely two months later, Paul Pogba makes a convenient scapegoat now that it transpires he did not arrive in England holding a wand that could magic away all of Manchester United\u2019s problems with one extravagant flourish. The temptation to give him a good kicking is strong, not least because he makes it easy for his critics. Pogba loves a flashy new haircut. He looks offensively pleased with himself when he scores. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/09/stormzy-and-laundry-ladies-the-new-face-of-transfer-announcements\">There was that whole Stormzy business. </a>He must be taken down.</p> <p>But before we all jump on the bandwagon in the wake of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/23/chelsea-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report\">United\u2019s humiliation at the hands of Chelsea</a>, it is worth considering why such an extraordinary talent is yet to replicate his Juventus form since putting on a red shirt again. Not because he is a foreign player who needs time to settle (resist the urge to shout that anyone <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/09/manchester-united-sign-paul-pogba-93-million-juventus\">signed for \u00a393.2m</a> should be hitting the ground running at a pace that would shame Usain Bolt). But because of the feeling that something deeper is at play here, that while trading on the romance and grandeur of United\u2019s name remains an easy enough sell to glitzy new signings and sponsors, deep pockets on their own are not enough to restore a club\u2019s shattered sense of identity on the pitch.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/oct/24/jose-mourinho-manchester-united-antonio-conte\">Don\u2019t be too swift to bury Jos\u00e9 Mourinho \u2013 the monster may be stirring</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It would be pushing it to make excuses for the way Pogba was strolling in midfield as N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9 scored Chelsea\u2019s fourth, other than to point out it was his third start in six days. Yet it is harder to understand why a player who excelled for Juventus has been so limp for United.</p> <p>There have been flashes, such as a starring performance in the thrashing of Leicester City and his lovely second goal in last week\u2019s victory over Fenerbahce, but one of the dilemmas for Jos\u00e9 Mourinho is that he appeared to have solved the Pogba conundrum by moving him from a deeper position to a role behind Zlatan Ibrahimovic against Leicester. There was a moment in that game when he linked up beautifully with Ibrahimovic, scooping a gorgeous pass over the top for the striker to swivel and almost score a superb volley. But his impact in the defeat at Chelsea and the goalless draw at Liverpool was minimal, his relationship with Ibrahimovic nonexistent. Surely there is more to come from the 23-year-old.</p> <p>But wait. If it is not quite fair to liken United\u2019s transfer policy since Sir Alex Ferguson\u2019s retirement to Real Madrid\u2019s gorge on gal\u00e1cticos, given that efforts have been made to improve their defence, it is nonetheless the case that Pogba and Ibrahimovic are merely the latest glamour signings who are unable to mask wider flaws. Perhaps the same can be said of Mourinho in the dugout, and Louis van Gaal before him.</p> <p>Surely there was more to come from Juan Mata, \u00c1ngel Di Mar\u00eda and Radamel Falcao. Just wait until the mysterious Henrikh Mkhitaryan settles. Surely Mourinho will sort it out.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/23/jose-mourinho-rages-manchester-united-incredible-mistakes-chelsea\">Jos\u00e9 Mourinho accuses Antonio Conte of humiliating him after Chelsea defeat</a> </p> </aside>  <p>United\u2019s signings make sense on their own. David Moyes tried to save himself by adding the creativity of Mata, the link man United craved. Van Gaal was given Di Mar\u00eda, a winger to provide dash and invention, until it turned out that Memphis Depay was the future. Falcao was an upgrade on Danny Welbeck and Javier Hern\u00e1ndez. Ander Herrera was the midfielder who could make United pass like a Spanish side. Morgan Schneiderlin would screen the defence. Pogba was the global midfield sensation they needed, Mkhitaryan the subtle No10, Ibrahimovic the trophy-winning goal machine.</p> <p>Spending hundreds of millions, the latest shiny toy is hailed as The Answer, while little of any significance changes. Mourinho seemed to have cracked it when he rightly dropped Wayne Rooney against Leicester. But just as England discovered in the draw with Slovenia, Rooney\u2019s decline is not the only issue.</p> <p>United have had three managers in the space of three and a bit seasons, each of them introducing a new way of playing to a mish-mash of a squad. Moyes floundered, Van Gaal placed too high a value on control and now Mourinho wants to implement a solid 4-2-3-1 that is beginning to look a little tired and dated with its reliance on physical strength. No wonder the players are confused. Chelsea are far from the finished article but they are developing into a team with a clear way of playing under Antonio Conte. The Italian has even found a use for Victor Moses other than sending him out on loan. He is managing his resources and working with the tools at his disposal, just as J\u00fcrgen Klopp has responded to Liverpool\u2019s weakness at left-back by moving James Milner there.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/audio/2016/oct/24/smalling-is-appalling-as-united-capitulate-at-chelsea-football-weekly\">Smalling is appalling as United capitulate at Chelsea \u2013 Football Weekly</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A simple test is to compare the football played by the league\u2019s top sides with United\u2019s. Pep Guardiola\u2019s Manchester City want to be expansive, Arsenal are playing Wengerball with more of a swagger with Alexis S\u00e1nchez up front, Mauricio Pochettino\u2019s Tottenham Hotspur press like demons and have plenty of ingenuity in attack, and Klopp\u2019s Liverpool attack from all angles. United proved themselves capable of stifling Liverpool but they played a destructive rather than a creative game.</p> <p>Every now and then, United click thanks to their individual quality. Di Mar\u00eda was a delight in the sunny early days but left for Paris Saint-Germain. Mata has chipped in with important goals but none of his managers have entirely trusted him. Ibrahimovic has faded since the Manchester derby. United are six points off the leaders, but they have been inconsistent for too long, erring by valuing individuals over the collective.</p> <p>Mourinho has made mistakes, from benching Anthony Martial to the treatment of Luke Shaw after the Watford defeat, to his struggle to let go of his inherent caution in big games. Perhaps he has lost the spark that made him special, a super manager whose aura has faded, a luxury hire by United when they needed someone fresher.</p> <p>Whatever happens next, however, it is becoming clearer that United need to think in the long term again, whoever is sitting in the dugout. Throwing wild sums of money at the problem is not the answer. Whatever you think of Guardiola\u2019s philosophy, the presence of Txiki Begiristain and Ferran Soriano in City\u2019s boardroom shows what kind of team City want to build. They stand for something now, whereas Pogba has joined a team without any discernible personality. Bringing in the next famous face, another big name, will not cure United\u2019s ills.</p>",

But what made Iceland\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/oct/18/gender.uk\">day of protest on 24 October 1975</a> so effective was the number of women who participated. It was not just the impact of 25,000 women \u2013 which, at the time, was a fifth of the female population \u2013 that gathered on the streets of Reykjavik, but the 90% of Iceland\u2019s female population who went on all-out professional and domestic strike. Teachers, nurses, office workers, housewives put down tools and didn\u2019t go to work, provide childcare or even cook in their kitchens. All to prove how indispensable they were.</p> <p>Thordis Loa Thorhallsdottir, CEO of a tourism company, was on the streets that day: \u201cI was 10 at the time, and I remember it very clearly, standing there with my mother, fighting. I can still feel the crowd and the power that was there. The big message was that if women don\u2019t work, the whole community is paralysed \u2013 the whole society.\u201d</p> <p>Grassroots activism at such a scale unsurprisingly had a significant material impact. Within five years, the country had the world\u2019s first democratically elected female president \u2013 Vigdis Finnbogadottir. Now in her 80s, this steely-eyed powerhouse tells me of the impact that day of protest had on her own career trajectory.</p> <p>\u201cI would never have been elected in 1980 if it hadn\u2019t been for the women\u2019s day of action \u2026 because when my predecessor announced that he was not going to stand again, the voices were immediately heard: now we have to have a woman among the candidates.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"724f044b3cfaf48ae6b12e5403666f0483eeeb1e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/724f044b3cfaf48ae6b12e5403666f0483eeeb1e/0_0_398_626/318.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Iceland is a good place to be a woman.\u2019\" width=\"318\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Iceland is a good place to be a woman.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Loftur \u00c1sgeirsson/Reykjavik City Museum</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Other landmarks soon followed. An all-female political party \u2013 the Women\u2019s Alliance \u2013 was established. More women were elected to parliament; by 1999, more than a third of MPs were women.</p> <p>And then, in 2000, parental leave legislation came into effect: whichevery person I spoke to highlighted this moment as key to Iceland\u2019s march to the top of the gender-equality table. Today, every parent receives three months\u2019 paid leave that is non-transferable. Parents then have an additional three months to share as they like.</p> <p>Because the pay is significant \u2013 80% of salary up to a ceiling of \u00a32,300 a month \u2013 and because it\u2019s on a use-it-or-lose-it basis, 90% of Icelandic fathers take up their paternal leave. This piece of social engineering has had a profound impact on men as well as women. Not only do women return to work after giving birth faster than before, they return to their pre-childbirth working hours faster, too. Research shows that, after taking the three months\u2019 leave, fathers continue to be significantly more involved in childcare and do more housework. Sharing the parental responsibilities and chores from the beginning, it seems, makes a difference.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a good place to be a woman,\u201d says Thorhallsdottir. And it is. Almost 80% of Icelandic women work. Thanks to mandatory quotas, almost half of board members of listed companies are now women, while 65% of Iceland\u2019s university students and 41% of MPs are female.</p> <p>Yet, women I met on my journey were also clear that the country has a long way to go. They still have less economic power than men \u2013 only 22% of managers are women; only 30% of experts on TV are women; and women still earn around 14% less than men. Iceland\u2019s record on all of these fronts is better than most countries; in the UK, women\u2019s hourly pay is 18% less than men.</p> <p>It is the gender pay gap that puzzles me the most. How can it be that it is still so significant given the huge efforts the state has put into mitigating the \u201cmummy penalty\u201d? Not only when it comes to parental leave, but with heavily subsidised nursery schools and after-school care?</p> <p>Explanations vary: from women going into less well-paid professions, to the <a href=\"https://www.tuc.org.uk/economic-issues/labour-market-and-economic-reports/equality-issues/gender-equality/gender-pay-gap\">penalty paid for working part-time</a> that we\u2019ve found in the UK as well, to the time it takes for employers\u2019 implicit gender biases to shift.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2010/mar/25/iceland-most-feminist-country\">Iceland: the world's most feminist country</a> </p> </aside>  <p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/steiney90/?hl=en\">Steiney Skuladottir</a>, one of Reykjav\u00edkurd\u00e6tur (or the <a href=\"https://noisey.vice.com/en_uk/article/reykjavkurdtur-interview-2016\">Daughters of Reykjavik</a>) \u2013 a feminist rap collective who rap about gender issues \u2013 puts the blame in part on women\u2019s reluctance to ask for sufficient pay compensation.

  "<p>Rokhsareh Ghaem Maghami does not look like a woman with a saviour complex. Blunt, self-aware and quick to mock her own heroics, she just seems a little too sceptical for a fairy godmother. Yet, during the three years she spent directing her latest documentary, the Iranian film-maker ended up paying $2,000 to \u201cbuy\u201d her teenage protagonist\u2019s freedom.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/oct/20/sonita-review-documentary-alizadeh-afghanistan-iran-music-arraged-marriage\">Sonita</a> follows the life of an Afghan refugee in Tehran. She dreams of becoming a famous rapper, but her mother and brother have other plans \u2013 to sell her into marriage in Afghanistan. So the 40-year-old director steps in, giving the family cash to delay the marriage. At first reluctantly and then with single-minded determination, Ghaem Maghami directs her subject to safety. By the end, Sonita Alizadeh has travelled to Afghanistan and on to the US to take up a scholarship, without her family\u2019s permission. A glance at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SonitaAlizadeh?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">her Twitter account</a> shows she has surpassed her own ambitions \u2013 performing in front of everyone from Chelsea Clinton to Laura Bush.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>\u2018You are never a fly on the wall.

What about a film-maker\u2019s duty to be an objective observer? She shakes her head. \u201cIt\u2019s always a lie. You are never a fly on the wall. You are always an elephant in the room. You change everything with your presence. I don\u2019t believe objectivity is important, or even happens. Human stories are always subjective and personal. The film-maker decides, creates.\u201d<br></p> <p>Ghaem Maghami never expected Sonita\u2019s story to have a happy ending. At first, she had no plans to shoot her at all. When she met the wide-eyed 17-year-old, who idolised Rihanna and the Iranian rapper Yas, it was as a favour to a cousin who worked at an NGO for child labourers and thought the director could help Sonita find some music training.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5d97d8482cbad55e543da55131d23a3a2a66ecbe\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5d97d8482cbad55e543da55131d23a3a2a66ecbe/0_36_4654_2793/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018She knew it would happen to her \u2013 she just didn\u2019t know when\u2019 \u2026 Ghaem Maghami.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018She knew it would happen to her \u2013 she just didn\u2019t know when\u2019 \u2026 Ghaem Maghami.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Maarten de Boer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t want to say hello or thank you,\u201d says Ghaem Maghami, which didn\u2019t exactly make her \u201can attractive documentary character\u201d. But soon Ghaem Maghami \u2013 whose previous films have looked at outsider artists, including a schizophrenic street painter \u2013 was intrigued by Sonita\u2019s determination. \u201cShe wanted a voice,\u201d recalls the director, \u201ceven though she was too shy to say her name. She said that as a child she used to like pop music but she had \u2018a million things to say\u2019 \u2013 so needed rap.\u201d</p> <p>One of three million Afghan refugees believed to be living in Iran, Sonita had no identity papers and was unsure of her real age. She had fled the Taliban as a child (in a heartbreaking scene, Sonita recalls her father and brother being held at gunpoint). She stayed in Iran with her sister and niece but, without papers, could not go to school. Instead, with characteristic pluck, Sonita bartered and begged her way to acquiring whatever skills and knowledge she could. \u201cShe found a woman volunteer in the mosque where she cleaned who helped her to read and write,\u201d Ghaem Maghami says. \u201cThey had no paper or ink \u2013 they would write on the wall or the windows with their fingers.\u201d<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/oct/20/sonita-review-documentary-alizadeh-afghanistan-iran-music-arraged-marriage\">Sonita review \u2013 a refugee's dreams of superstardom</a> </p> </aside>  <p>She took up karate but, without identity papers, could not gain her black belt. She excelled in photography but could only enter competitions under someone else\u2019s name. When Ghaem Maghami began filming, it was the discrimination Sonita faced that fascinated her: Afghans in Iran are often stereotyped as dirty, a danger to women, a threat to jobs. \u201cThey are living in a kind of segregation in Iran,\u201d she says. \u201cAfghan men, you only see working. Afghan women, you just don\u2019t see. Iranians don\u2019t know much about the reality of their life.\u201d </p> <p>Soon a more pressing issue took over: forced marriage. For Ghaem Maghami, it seemed a shocking practice. But for Sonita and the Afghan girls at the NGO that supported them, it was an everyday reality. In one scene, Sonita casually asks a recently engaged girl: \u201cDid you agree, or did they beat you?\u201d She is told: \u201cThey beat me up first.\u201d At other times, they discuss their \u201cbride price\u201d, something Sonita angrily says makes them sound \u201clike sheep\u201d.<br></p> <p>\u201cIt was an issue all her friends faced,\u201d says Ghaem Maghami. \u201cShe knew it would happen to her. She just didn\u2019t know when.\u201d The answer comes 30 minutes in, when Sonita\u2019s brother tells her she must return to Afghanistan to be married so he can use the money to buy a wife himself. We see Sonita \u2013 and then her teacher at the NGO \u2013 begging her mother to forbid it, but to no avail. Yet Ghaem Maghami insists that blaming the family for being mercenary is too simplistic. \u201cSonita\u2019s mother is as loving as any other,\u201d she says. \u201cShe is in a bad situation. If you are struggling to survive, no one can say you care only about money.

Only 18% of Afghan women are literate, compared to 45% of men; in Iran, it\u2019s 82% and 91%. \u201cOne of the reasons girls get married early is that they don\u2019t have access to education. Families don\u2019t see any future for them. They didn\u2019t understand about Sonita\u2019s music \u2013 it was like a joke for them. They didn\u2019t understand her plan for life.\u201d</p> <p>There was only one way to free Sonita from a forced marriage: to pay up. But it wasn\u2019t the first time Ghaem Maghami had stepped in to the story. In an early scene, the young singer, along with her older sister and nine-year-old niece, are evicted from their home. The director helped them find somewhere else. It was interventions like this, she says, that created the trust between the pair, meaning Sonita finally opened up.</p> <p>But even just paying part of the bride price was a drastic move for the film-maker. \u201cIf you pay for every problem, you will never have a movie,\u201d she says, letting out a smoky laugh. \u201cThe crew blamed me because they said Sonita didn\u2019t seem worried. She could see in my eyes I would pay it.\u201d<br></p> <p>Off-camera, in events that weren\u2019t included in the film, things became even more dramatic. Sonita\u2019s brother-in-law was a brutally violent drug addict. When he was released from prison he tried to sell Sonita\u2019s niece into marriage. The police answer was to suggest deporting the whole family. Once more, the film-maker offered an escape, sheltering the little girl until her mother could move them away. Sonita, who had always protected her niece, moved in too, but did not escape unscathed. \u201cHe saw Sonita in the street and tried to kill her,\u201d Ghaem Maghami says. \u201cHe tried to burn her and, once, tried to hit her with a brick.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xIJ9Ch-rKU\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/-xIJ9Ch-rKU?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xIJ9Ch-rKU\">Watch the trailer for Sonita</a>. </figcaption> </figure>   <p>After helping Sonita make a music video called Brides for Sale, the director made sure her activist friends shared it widely. It went viral and the young singer was offered a high school scholarship in the US. But first she needed a visa, meaning she had to return to Afghanistan. If she failed, she could not return to Iran. The pair also decided not to tell Sonita\u2019s family about their plans. \u201cI was very worried,\u201d the director says. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t know what else we could do. We were on a highway with no exit. There was no turning round. All we could do was drive as fast as possible.\u201d</p> <p>The gamble paid off. Sonita, says Ghaem Maghami , is happy in her new life, while her family couldn\u2019t be prouder. \u201cThey can see she is successful and respected,\u201d says the director, who hopes her film will change attitudes to refugees worldwide. \u201cThey can see she has a future.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/oct/20/sonita-review-documentary-alizadeh-afghanistan-iran-music-arraged-marriage\">Sonita</a> is out now in the UK.</p>",

When&#xa0;will Theresa May listen?</a>, theguardian.com, 20 October) made me think that there might be a route back to power for Labour, if it became the party for the 48% who wish to remain in the EU, and for the many more who are coming to that view as the consequences of leaving become apparent.</p> <p>A decision to challenge the referendum result would need to be accompanied by policies to help those who have been left behind by globalisation, many of whom voted Brexit because they had so little to lose. This is partly about investing in a more balanced distribution of economic growth, but also requires unapologetic support for redistribution, focusing on the need to address an unprecedented increase in inequality, and the real hardship faced by those left behind.</p> <p>With the Tory government set on inflicting enormous and irreversible damage to our economy, our society, and our union, there is a once in a lifetime opportunity for Labour to be the party of the sane alternative, attracting voters who would not perhaps normally vote Labour. Who knows, with a bit of compromise, it might even be possible to forge a united Labour opposition around that position. It is perhaps the only issue where there is a real possibility of attracting enough new Labour voters to evict the Conservatives.<br><strong>Mick Foster</strong><br><em>Chelmsford, Essex</em></p> <p>\u2022 Polly Toynbee refers to the four freedoms. Why only four freedoms? Why is each beneficial to commercial enterprises but not necessarily to the wider community? (The welfare of megacorporations is not synonymous with social welfare.) Why are there only freedoms to, not freedom from? Why freedom to extend the iron grip of economic reductionism, not freedom from phenomena like job insecurity and freedom from fear of losing the continuity of community? What\u2019s wrong with economics as though people matter?</p> <p>The compression of human rights into four freedoms leads to a conflation of human rights with the neoliberal agenda. This is naive and dangerous. Let\u2019s change the terms of the debate in Europe, not just chunter on as though \u201cfour freedoms\u201d is an unquestionable assertion of fundamental moral principle.

This would prevent (or discourage) speculative migration, where people move from one country to another and then search for work on arrival. While it would therefore be likely to reduce flows of unskilled workers, it would not prevent employers from recruiting abroad for hard-to-fill jobs, in agriculture, or in the care and hospitality sectors.</p> <p>Such an arrangement could be characterised as demand-led free movement and, as such, could be acceptable to our negotiating partners. It would not give the government the control it currently appears to seek in respect of the total volume of inward migration. But by restricting the supply of unskilled or entry-level labour, it would address a major concern expressed during the referendum debate on the effect of EU free movement on wages for the lower-paid. Perhaps the basis for the type of sensible compromise that will need to be made by both parties to ensure not a hard or soft Brexit, but a good Brexit.<br><strong>Ian Jones</strong><br><em>Fownhope, Herefordshire</em></p> <p>\u2022 As a remain voter in the EU referendum, I note with some disdain the way in which the EU leaders have dealt with Theresa May in recent days. Rather than treating her with dignity and magnanimity as a leader who is trying to do the best with the hand she has been given by the British people, she was treated like a petulant child who had misbehaved and now had to suffer (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/21/theresa-may-eu-council-summit-brexit-russia-\" title=\"\">Sketch</a>, 22 October).

We should be under no illusions that they will negotiate on free movement or allow us not to pay into the EU\u2019s central budget in order for us to continue to play a part in it.

His comments are the most detailed he has made on the likely course of negotiations since the Brexit vote on 23 June.</p> <p>Although the government\u2019s negotiating <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/24/brexit-strategy-scotland-wales-northern-ireland-direct-line-david-davis-theresa-may\">strategy has not been agreed</a>, he said it was clear that the UK was heading for the \u201charder end of a Brexit\u201d, due to the primacy being <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/31/restricting-immigration-will-be-at-heart-of-brexit-deal-theresa-may-says\">given to UK border controls</a> and parliamentary sovereignty.</p> <p>Speaking at the Institute for Government, Fraser said it was inevitable that negotiations over Britain\u2019s future political and economic relationship with the EU, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/08/mps-demand-vote-hard-brexit-single-market\">access to the single market</a> and security and foreign policy considerations, would take longer than two years. <br></p> <p>\u201cThis will inevitably mean some sort of interim relationship between leaving and establishing the long-term, permanent relationship,\u201d he said. </p> <p>He said parliament would seek to be involved in any decision. \u201cIt does seem to me that government does have a responsibility to make sure that parliament is properly informed about what is happening,\u201d Fraser said.</p> <p>\u201cWe have got to have a democratic process around this \u2026 I do not understand how we could go though a multi-year negotiation of at least two years to determine the terms on how we leave the EU, and then do that without at least some sort of parliamentary vote on that.\u201d </p> <p>Fraser also supported to parliament\u2019s right to be involved, saying a vote was going to be required at the most basic level. \u201cIf you were in a commercial organisation, you would never commit yourself now to accepting the terms of a negotiation on a deal that is going to be finished in two years\u2019 time.\u201d </p> <p>He said he did not expect the EU to give an early signal on whether it would give the UK an interim agreement, since this would represent a concession. But an unfavourable rupture was not in either side\u2019s economic interest, Fraser said.</p> <p>\u201cI am not a catastrophist, but let us be clear: this is going to be an incredibly difficult, tough and complex negotiation. One of the objectives of the EU side is to make it absolutely clear to anyone else thinking of leaving the EU that this is not a good idea.</p> <p>\u201cFor them, it must be absolutely clear that leaving the EU there has to be a price tag attached to that, and we are going to have accept that in terms of our economic position in relationship to the single market and in terms of our political relationship.</p> <p>\u201cWe will have less automatic involvement in the future. That is inevitable.\u201d </p> <p>If the UK did fail to reach an agreement on its separation terms, further negotiations on a trading relationship with the single market would be significantly harder, Fraser said. </p> <p>He said if the UK was not able to strike such a deal, and instead chose an arrangement based on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/29/liam-fox-looks-to-wto-in-hint-at-hard-brexit-stance\">the World Trade Organisation relationship</a> with the EU, \u201cthat would be very worrying for the UK economy\u201d. </p> <p>\u201cWe would lose the automatic tariff-free access to the EU single market, and inward investment in the UK could be affected. A lot of investment in the UK was done with the specific objective of gaining access to the European market \u2013 that was clearly the understanding,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cIf we go to less favourable terms of trade, then the context of business investment is changed. Personally, I think it is a scenario we should seek to avoid.\u201d </p> <p>His assumption was that the government would negotiate \u201csome sort of continuation of our current access to the single market, rather than the negotiation of a completely new agreement and arrangement.\u201d</p> <p>Fraser said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/02/theresa-may-great-repeal-bill-eu-british-law\">the government\u2019s \u201cgreat repeal bill\u201d</a>, which is due to be introduced by ministers when article 50 is triggered, provided a potential structure for an interim agreement, since it would translate EU law into UK law, \u201cgiving us the legal basis to continue that existing relationship on the basis of the content of existing law\u201d.</p>",
  "<p>The EU\u2019s hopes of signing a free-trade agreement with Canada this week are on a knife-edge after Belgium announced it could not sign the treaty because of opposition from regional parliaments.<br></p> <p>The collapse of the negotiations in Belgium highlights the pitfalls that may await the British government when it seeks to negotiate a trade deal with the EU after Brexit.</p> <p>The Belgian prime minister, Charles Michel, announced on Monday that Belgium was not ready to sign the EU-Canada trade pact, following emergency talks between the country\u2019s federal and regional leaders.<br></p> <p>Despite the Belgian stalemate, Canada\u2019s prime minister, Justin Trudeau, did not immediately postpone a trip to Brussels this Thursday, where he is due to sign the treaty.<br></p> <p>Donald Tusk, the head of the European council, said he and Trudeau thought Thursday\u2019s summit was still possible. \u201cWe encourage all parties to find a solution. There\u2019s yet time,\u201d Tusk tweeted after speaking to the Canadian leader.</p> <p>A key ally of the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, added his support. Manfred Weber, the leader of the centre-right European People\u2019s party, said the trade deal was not dead. \u201cEverything should be done to make it enter into force. All concerns have been tackled. Everyone should help.\u201d</p> <p>Tusk had given Belgium a deadline of Monday night to sort out its problems, but emergency talks in Brussels in the afternoon showed that the treaty remained stuck. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"468119088ccac70eae87acc71d2b06b7ccd6aff6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/468119088ccac70eae87acc71d2b06b7ccd6aff6/0_187_3744_2247/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Walloon minister-president Paul Magnette talks to the press\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Walloon minister-president Paul Magnette has led opposition to the deal.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Laurie Dieffembacq/Belga/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Paul Magnette, Wallonia\u2019s minister-president, who has led opposition to the deal, said his position had not changed, as he left the intra-Belgian negotiations. He had failed to show up for crisis talks with the European commission on Sunday, according to Michel.<br></p> <p>\u201cThe response of the Walloon government did not surprise us in view of the politics of the empty chair yesterday,\u201d Michel said. \u201cWe have been confronted with an empty chair yesterday and silence from the Walloon representatives this morning.\u201d</p> <p>The EU and Canada have spent more than seven years preparing the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (Ceta), but the treaty has stumbled near the finish line because of opposition from the Socialist-led parliament in Wallonia.<br></p> <p>The trade treaty would eliminate nearly all tariffs between the EU and Canada. But Walloon leaders worry they are being pressed into an unequal bargain that disadvantages their farmers against Canadian beef and pork producers.</p> <p>Walloon politicians have denounced pressure on them to sign the treaty. Tusk\u2019s ultimatum was not serious, the president of the Walloon parliament, Andr\u00e9 Antoine, told TV station RTBF. \u201cWe want to bring back law and democracy to these great treaties that affect the daily life of our citizens.\u201d<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"f45d54287fc7595024ba660ae3753d11abbbc691\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f45d54287fc7595024ba660ae3753d11abbbc691/0_95_3744_2247/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Flemish minister-president Geert Bourgeois leaves the meeting\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Flemish minister-president Geert Bourgeois said: \u2018We\u2019re the laughing stock of the whole world\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Laurie Dieffembacq/Belga/ Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Belgian politicians who support Ceta questioned why Walloon critics raised their concerns so late in the day. \u201cWe have had the texts since April 2014,\u201d said Geert Bourgeois, the minister-president of Flanders.<br></p> <p>Bourgeois, a member of the centre-right separatist party New Flemish Alliance, described the failure of the talks as a real shame. \u201cWe\u2019re the laughing stock of the whole world. It\u2019s bad for Wallonia, for Flanders, for Belgium, for Europe, for the whole world.\u201d</p> <p>Belgium\u2019s unique constitutional arrangements mean trade treaties must be approved by six assemblies. In an embarrassing snub to the EU, the Brussels capital region, home to the EU institutions, also rejected the treaty, as did Belgium\u2019s Francophone federation. Flanders, Belgium\u2019s German-speaking regional parliament and Belgium\u2019s federal government support the treaty.</p> <p>EU trade treaties can only enter into force with unanimous agreement of all 28 member states.</p> <p>A spokesperson for the European commission, which is responsible for negotiating EU trade agreements, said it stood \u201cready to continue assisting whenever needed in this process\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cBelgium is still in the process of establishing its position through its relevant institutional procedures and in line with its constitutional order. We of course respect these. Patience is of the essence.\u201d</p> <p>The commission has suggested that talks will continue later in the year. \u201cThe commission does not tend to work with ultimatums or deadlines,\u201d the spokesperson said, in an implicit criticism of Tusk\u2019s approach. </p> <p>The problems nailing down a trade treaty with a close ally of Europe have put officials in deep gloom and raised doubts about future pacts with the US and China.</p> <p>Even if Belgium patches up its differences over Ceta, that would not be the end of the story. Following agreement among 28 governments, the trade treaty would come into force on a temporary basis. But it could only become a permanent legal text after ratification by 28 national parliaments and 10 regional assemblies and upper houses.</p> <p>Critics say the European commission, which is responsible for negotiating trade agreements, has ceded too much power to national parliaments. The growing role of national assemblies means that Belgium\u2019s German-speaking parliament, representing 76,000 people, could, in theory, block a trade agreement between the EU and the UK.</p> <p>British officials have played down similarities, arguing that putting up trade barriers will be a very different exercise to taking them down. Chris Grayling, a pro-leave minister, has said he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/23/eu-trade-deadlock-canada-no-ill-omen-brexit-deal-chris-grayling\">does not fear a veto from the Walloon parliament</a> because Britain buys \u201ca whole load of produce from Walloon farmers\u201d and tariffs would not be in their interest.</p> <p>That optimism appeared to be given some credibility by Merkel, who suggested on Friday that she did not see a parallel between Ceta and future talks with the UK.</p>",

Consider the top one. We subtract this number from the number above it to give us another number, to which we append a digit, and then subtract a multiple of the divisor. If, however, we cannot subtract a multiple of the divisor (because the number with a single digit appended is smaller than the divisor), then we put a 0 in the quotient in the space directly above the appended digit, and then append a second number. As you can see in both lines B, two digits have been appended, which means that in both cases there must be a zero in the quotient. So we know that the quotient must be of the form <em>x</em>080<em>x</em>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fb0c1d2ef2359232ef03d8e265123fb81a31469a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fb0c1d2ef2359232ef03d8e265123fb81a31469a/0_404_1224_734/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Step 2\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Step 2</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alex Bellos</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Now, we also know that 8 times the divisor is equal to the number circled in red, which has three digits. We know that the final digit of the quotient times the divisor is equal to the number circled in green, which has four digits. So the final digit of the quotient must be larger than 8, so it is 9. <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"316faca55be6785a57c37d83c3de814b98f32803\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/316faca55be6785a57c37d83c3de814b98f32803/0_371_1224_734/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Step 3\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Step 3</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alex Bellos</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>From above, 8 times the divisor is a three-digit number, which means that the divisor must be less than 125, since 8 x 125 = 1000, which is a four digit number. So the divisor is 124 or less.</p> <p>Now imagine the first digit of the quotient is 7. Then 7 times the divisor is the number in blue, which has 3 digits. But since the divisor is 124 or less, the number in blue must be 7 x 124 = 868 or less. But if it was 868, then when subtracted from the first four digits of the dividend, you would get a three digit number, not a two digit number (marked orange). So the first digit of the quotient cannot be 7 and likewise we can eliminate all digits less than 7. But we can also eliminate 9, since we know from above that 9 times the quotient has four digits, not three!

  "<p>We won\u2019t stop. That is what the images from last Wednesday\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/20/argentina-women-south-america-marches-violence-ni-una-menos\" title=\"\">massive marches in Buenos Aires and across Argentina</a> against gender violence are saying.</p> <p>What took place shows that something important started last year with the first massive demonstrations on behalf of the right of women to lead lives without the fear of violence. The movement continues to grow stronger every day.</p> <p>This time, as was the case for the two previous marches of June last year and again in June this year, women and men of all ages took to the streets of Argentina. Sometimes they did so despite cold, driving rain, just to make it clear that in a society that knows how to protest in favour of other rights \u2013 the rights of workers, human rights \u2013 the time has come also to face up to machismo in everyday life.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/19/argentina-women-strike-violence-protest\">Argentina: hundreds of thousands of women set to protest against violence</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Argentina needs effective public policies against gender violence. But it also needs every individual to take responsibility for their private behaviour on a daily basis too. \u201cFemicide\u201d, as the murder of women as a result of domestic violence and other categories of hate crimes against women has been defined by law in our country, is a huge and urgent problem. In the 18 days leading up to Wednesday\u2019s march there were 19 such murders of women in Argentina. These killings are the end result of small, daily acts of machismo.</p> <p>Despite the marches, Argentina is far from being a feminist country. It never was before and it\u2019s not one now. It was only in 1991 that Argentinian female politicians obtained, not without hard work, a law guaranteeing <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentine_quota_law\" title=\"\">30% of elective posts for women</a>. The struggle continues for total equality. Then and now, male politicians have attempted to block this initiative.</p> <p>Abortion is legal in just a few special cases, such as a health risk for the mother and rape. Women also continue to be underpaid, earning 30% less than men for the same job. And even though female students today are the majority at Argentina\u2019s universities and increasingly active as academic researchers, decision-making and directive posts are still reserved for men.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e996eb9a0be34e6f38d6ab6e5b8b028e8f400edd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e996eb9a0be34e6f38d6ab6e5b8b028e8f400edd/0_269_4305_2583/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A girl takes part in a march against gender violence.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Sometimes big, long-lasting movements start with a spark.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Eitan Abramovich/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>So the broad support for the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/19/the-guardian-view-on-niunamenos-challenging-misogyny-and\" title=\"\">#NiUnaMenos \u201cnot one less\u201d movement</a> is not something anybody could easily have imagined would happen in Argentina.

But now, in this unusually cold and rainy October for Argentina, a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/19/argentina-women-strike-violence-protest\" title=\"\">new brutal femicide</a> became headline news and the reaction was colossal. The protest is still not enough, but it\u2019s worthwhile. It\u2019s not a solution, but it\u2019s a statement and an assuming of collective responsibilities in the violence against women.</p> <p>Women, men, teenagers and kids (yes, there were families out in the rain) held handmade posters with passionate slogans and drawings. Some of them told stories of violence against women, others just showed solidarity and asked for people to open their eyes to what is happening.</p> <p>Sometimes big, long-lasting movements start with a spark. I\u2019d like to think that #NiUnaMenos is the spark for a new Argentina that is better for women.</p>",

At the time, just seven libraries had been threatened with closure.</p> <p>But deputy leader Lee Jeavons <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-birmingham-37718448\">told the BBC</a>: \u201cWhen we looked at that last year, obviously we were in opposition. You don\u2019t get to see the books in opposition in the way that you do when you\u2019re actually in control.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhen we achieved control back in May along with our Liberal Democrat coalition colleagues, we found out that there was an internal pressure in terms of the budget in social care which was already at that point, in quarter one, \u00a35,000,000 overspent\u201d said Jeavons. \u201cNow, we don\u2019t want to stop looking after old people, so we\u2019ve got to look at ways of making that in-year saving and this is one of the options.\u201d</p> <p>A petition protesting against the closure of the art gallery and libraries, which says that shutting them down \u201cwill destroy the atmosphere of many surrounding communities\u201d, has already been <a href=\"https://www.change.org/p/walsall-art-gallery-closure-of-walsall-art-gallery-yet-another-significant-social-demise-of-identity\">signed by almost 2,500 people</a>.</p> <p>The proposed closures in Walsall come as libraries across the UK are under threat, with more than 300 closing in the last six years. In a House of Lords debate earlier this month, Big Issue founder Lord Bird called the UK\u2019s public library service \u201cessential\u201d, and asked the government to \u201csupply some emergency relief money to stop local authorities doing this dastardly deed, this process of philistinising our communities\u201d.</p>",
  "<p>\u201cUniversities like \u2018slave plantations\u2019\u201d was the headline <a href=\"http://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/universities-like-slave-plantations-n8nk6fwsm\" title=\"\">the Sunday Times</a> gave to its article covering a talk I gave recently at <a href=\"http://www.gold.ac.uk/calendar/?id=10086\" title=\"\">Goldsmiths University in London</a>. It is a strange sensation to see your words in print, particularly so when those words are out of order and context therefore altering the meaning. The headline suggests I was somehow comparing the experiences of the enslaved to those of staff and students on campus. That would have been not only absurd but also offensive, considering the history of unspeakable horror of the transatlantic slave trade. The metaphor of the plantation was not used to explore the experiences in the university but the regressive role it plays in society.</p> <p>As places of critical thought, universities have the allure of being incubators for progressive ideals. Student movements and academic developments such as feminism and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/20/black-studies-university-course-long-overdue\" title=\"\">black studies</a> play into this mythical notion. The reality is, however, that until the 1960s, <a href=\"https://www.timeshighereducation.com/features/participation-rates-now-we-are-50/2005873.article\" title=\"\">less than 5% of the population</a> went to university and they were bastions of white, male privilege. In the 18th century, the botanist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jun/13/wikipedia-influence-list-carl-linnaeus\" title=\"\">Carl Linnaeus</a>, in his System Naturae, outlined the hierarchy of being, with Europaeus Albus (white) at the top and Afer Niger (black), firmly at the bottom. It is no coincidence that he has a university in Sweden named after him. My colleague Nathaniel <s>Coleman</s> <a href=\"https://www.timeshighereducation.com/comment/opinion/eugenics-the-academys-complicity/2016190.article\" title=\"\">highlighted the role</a> of Francis Galton at UCL promoting the eugenics movement; and racial \u201cscience\u201d was a key Nazi justification for the Holocaust. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/deepa\" title=\"\">Deepa Naik</a> perfectly summed up the universities\u2019 role in society when she argued at last year\u2019s NUS black students\u2019 conference that \u201cthe university is not racist, it is racism\u201d.</p> <p>The reason I invoked Audre Lorde\u2019s metaphor of the university as the <a href=\"http://collectiveliberation.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Lorde_The_Masters_Tools.pdf\" title=\"\">\u201cmaster\u2019s house\u201d</a> was as a challenge to academics. We cannot assume that just because the student body has become more diverse since the 60s that the role of universities has changed. Other presenters on the day highlighted the inequalities present in universities: from staff experiences of being ignored or mistaken for the cleaner, to prospective ethnic minority students being warned off applying to elite universities because they would not fit in.</p> <p>The exclusionary curriculum, bought to the fore by the student-led campaign <a href=\"http://www.nus.org.uk/en/news/why-is-my-curriculum-white/\" title=\"\">\u201cWhy is my curriculum white?\u201d</a> also featured prominently in the day. If we understand the university as the master\u2019s house, then the institutional racism embedded in universities does not come as a surprise. If the university is racism, then of course the experience within it will be exclusionary.</p> <p>For an academic concerned with overcoming racial inequality, this poses a very serious challenge. In class when I taught these concepts, one of my students diagnosed my role as that of the \u201coverseer\u201d, maintaining the system of racial oppression. This jarring metaphor serves as a reminder of the institutional role of universities, which I can do little to alter. The inequalities in the school system affect who achieves the grades to attend; students who do make the grade are charged \u00a39,000 a year and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/aug/01/maintenance-grants-scrapped-for-poorest-students\" title=\"\">government just replaced maintenance grants</a> for the poorest students with loans. Universities assign credentials to graduates that justify their place in the social order; however, the likelihood of achieving the \u201cbest\u201d degree, from the \u201ctop\u201d institutions is <a href=\"http://www.runnymedetrust.org/uploads/Aiming%20Higher.pdf\" title=\"\">too heavily influenced by class and race</a> to even resemble a meritocracy. Instead, the result is a system that reproduces the inequalities in society.</p> <p>The nature of academia is that career advancement is achieved by attending conferences and writing papers for other academics, creating a self-referential bubble where our critical knowledge gets trapped within the university. The separation of thought from action, of university from the social world, is a key way that inequalities are maintained. The academic industrial complex creates institutional forms as real and discriminatory as those that exist in the police force, which we are quick to condemn. If the university is the master house, then we are among the tools that maintain the edifice.</p> <p>The bleak metaphor of the plantation was not meant to discourage but to disturb, in the hope of rethinking our roles in universities. Our aim cannot just be to get a better representation of students and staff on campus; we need to change the nature of what we do. Even with increasing neoliberalisation, universities remain places where academics maintain the autonomy of a profession. Our research agendas are not (necessarily) dictated to us, we have some control over our time and flexibility (within boundaries) about what we teach. As such we occupy an incredibly privileged position. We can organically engage with social movements off campus, and gear our work towards improving the social conditions that we so eloquently describe. This is the main reason we started the black studies movement in Britain \u2013 because we are committed to using university for social change. But doing so means recognising our privilege; the regressive role that universities continue to play in society, and the institutional barriers we must overcome.</p>",
  "<p>All of that and it comes to this. The game that had everything, on the weekend that had it all, had its ending too. Mestalla, so loud your ears hurt, fell quiet for the first and last time. Briefly but it did, as if taking in what had just happened \u2013 Luis Su\u00e1rez down, Alberto Undiano Mallenco blowing his whistle this time \u2013 and what was just about to. One shot, one opportunity. One moment to define a match Luis Enrique said had been \u201ctrue to what a Valencia-Barcelona is: tense to the end\u201d. The very end, in fact: 6.05 on a Saturday evening, the stadium clock long stopped at 90. It had gone from 0-1 to 1-1, 1-1 to 2-1, and 2-1 to 2-2. From there it could have gone anywhere, wide open and wild, but it came here.</p> <p>There are last minute penalties and then there was this. It\u2019s not like it doesn\u2019t happen, just not quite like at Mestalla, not just the last men standing but the best, smoke still rising around them, the smell of sulphur. Literally and figuratively in Valencia, land of rockets, bangers and burning effigies. \u201cMasclet\u00e1!\u201d \u2013 a festival of firecrackers \u2013 shouted the cover of Sport the day after a game that was intense and controversial, emotional and enjoyable, in which tackles flew and goalkeepers did too, one that had over 20 shots . And one last one to settle it all, for good or bad. Like it was all building to and condensed in this moment, like two superheroes face to face. <em>So, we meet at last</em>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/22/valencia-barcelona-la-liga-match-report\">Barcelona players hit by bottle after Lionel Messi sinks Valencia</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cHitchcock at Mestalla,\u201d ran the headline in AS after a game in which Valencia came out fast, hard, crunching into challenges, the knife between their teeth. Neymar took the hits again, Andr\u00e9 Gomes got one too, right on the shin, but Andr\u00e9s Iniesta came off the worst from a challenge that was far from the worst, applauded off on a stretcher. Barcelona took the lead, Su\u00e1rez \u2013 in an offside position and in front of the goalkeeper Diego Alves \u2013 leaping over Leo Messi\u2019s shot to let it go in. Alves saved from Su\u00e1rez, twice, and Marc-Andr\u00e9 ter Stegen blocked Daniel Parejo. Undiano Mallenco ignored a push from Samuel Umtiti on Rodrigo and Mestalla erupted. The first half ended 1-0 but it could have been more and it would be; it wasn\u2019t over, everyone knew.</p> <p>Valencia\u2019s players headed down the tunnel angry, while the sporting director headed to the dressing room to give the referee a piece of his mind; they emerged angrier, or so it seemed. Ivan Rakitic hit the post. Munir Haddadi came on at half-time, and scored against his former team eight minutes later. Paco Alc\u00e1cer didn\u2019t come on at all, despite chants from the Valencia fans for him to come off the bench and despite Barcelona having to chase the game. Munir\u2019s goal was brilliantly taken and silently celebrated. By him, anyway. Everyone else went wild. Valencia had taken a step forward \u2013 about 40 yards forward \u2013 and the game opened and stretched. Rodrigo swept in the second from a gorgeous Nani pass.</p> <p>Three minutes had passed between the goals, minutes Luis Enrique called \u201chalf-mad\u201d but not half as mad as the 35 that remained. Barcelona had been caught; one Valencia player privately suggested that, 1-0 up, creating chances, they had thought it would be easy. Now they had to chase; instead of control, there was chaos. It wasn\u2019t open because of tiredness, Barcelona\u2019s manager said, but because they were <em>too</em> keen to turn it round. They knew that with Sevilla-Atl\u00e9tico and Madrid-Athletic to come, defeat might mean trailing by five points, while victory could mean pulling ahead of Madrid. Andr\u00e9 Gomes was out there, seemingly dazed in the middle of it all and soon replaced by Denis Su\u00e1rez, but the rest raced around. The game got faster, longer and more chaotic. Rakitic headed, Alves saved, and Luia Su\u00e1rez smacked in the rebound.</p> <p>Still it accelerated. \u201cWe had chances to win it and chances to lose it too,\u201d Luis Enrique admitted. \u201cWe gave them too many opportunities.\u201d Neymar had half a chance, so did Luis Su\u00e1rez. Munir too. Nani had a whole one, <em>the</em> chance: one on one, clean through, he put it wide.</p> <p>Rakitic was everywhere, putting out fires. And Aymen Abdennour, on at left-back for Valencia, threw himself into every ball, greeted with a roar.</p> <p>Until, in the last minute, Valencia, chasing the game every bit as hard as Barcelona, lost the ball at one end and immediately found Messi running at them up at the other end. He slipped the pass to Luis Su\u00e1rez and Abdennour made one last lunge. Su\u00e1rez went down. Silence, then another roar. If there had been doubts about the challenge on Rodrigo, there were none now.</p> <p>And so, it comes to this. 2-2, 91 minutes had gone, and there\u2019s Messi: the best player in the world, sure, but the man who\u2019s missed 20 penalties for the team that\u2019s made a habit of not scoring them, the latest three days before. In front of him stands Alves \u2013 \u201cand <em>madre m\u00eda</em> he looks enourmous in that goal,\u201d Luis Enrique says later.</p> <p>Alves\u2019s former coach believes he has a \u201cgift\u201d and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2015/jan/26/valencias-diego-alves-shows-penalty-prowess-yet-again-against-sevilla\" title=\"\">his gift is saving penalties</a>; there\u2019s something almost inevitable about it now. He\u2019s stopped more than anyone else ever in Spain including his last three and, with 45 faced, 21 scored, 22 saved, one wide, and one post, the stats show he\u2019s more likely to save it than you are to score it \u2013 whoever you are. He\u2019s saved from Cristiano Ronaldo, Antoine Griezmann, Fredi Kanout\u00e9 and Diego Costa. Leo Messi, too. In 2012.</p> <p>Messi knows. And just in case he doesn\u2019t, Alves helpfully reminds him. Leaning in, tapping Messi on the chest with a gloved finger, he tells him: \u201cI\u2019ve stopped you before, remember?\u201d After all, the art of stopping penalties is, by his own admission, the art of \u201cpsychological war\u201d and his reputation goes before him; more importantly, it stands before them.</p> <p>Messi nods gently once, but doesn\u2019t say anything; he just looks down at the ball in his hands. Rakitic steps in, so does Sergio Busquets, trying to get Alves out of there. The referee tells them to leave it to him. He ushers Alves back, who now decides he needs to stop for a drink of water. Undiano doesn\u2019t agree. It\u2019s taken long enough already; almost two minutes have passed.</p> <p>\u201cAlves! Alves! Alves!\u201d the fans shout. On the touchline, Luis Enrique shouts to stick it down the middle.</p> <p>Messi doesn\u2019t hear him. How could he in this din? He runs up with the clock at 93.23. Alves steps out early and quickly, diagonally forwards to his right, narrowing the angle. He goes the right way, does everything he can, but the ball is hit hard, low and right in the corner, so close to his hand but just out of reach. Messi celebrates, Barcelona\u2019s players pile on, screaming and celebrating. Neymar says something along the lines of \u201cup yours\u201d. From the stands, a bottle is thrown, full of water, and lands right in the middle. Su\u00e1rez and Neymar go down, Javier Mascherano stumbles backwards.</p> <p>Messi lets loose, celebrating even more, clenching his fists and pointing. Alves tries to hold him back, Enzo P\u00e9rez too, but something has taken over.</p> <p>Valencia\u2019s fans are furious; the point has been taken from them and they think unfairly. Their sporting director, Suso Garc\u00eda Pitarch, accuses the referee, calling him \u201clamentable\u201d and saying he\u2019ll be ashamed when he watches on TV later. If so, he won\u2019t be the only one. Prandelli is more subtle, speaking in Italian without a translator and using a phrase they all need translating, \u201csudditanza psicologica\u201d: referees are psychologically subservient to the big teams, he suggests. And Valencian sports paper Super Deporte is as subtle as ever. The next day it leads on an act of \u201c<em>chorizity</em>\u201d \u2013 Spain\u2019s spicy sausage, you see, also refers to theft \u2013 and the day after that they go for \u201c<em>Farca</em>\u201d.</p> <p>At the end Prandelli sent his players back out to applaud the fans. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to digest right now. [But] I\u2019m proud of my team: I prefer a brave team to a timid one,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Luis Enrique is proud too. There\u2019s something eloquent in Messi\u2019s celebration, in the release \u2013 it is not just about the bottle or the fans, but the tension of the match and that moment, the responsibility and the pressure of a penalty that most probably expected him to miss; about the injury to Iniesta; and about the way Barcelona came back. The fact they did at all, and what they would have lost had they not, Mundo Deportivo suggesting this is the kind of victory that wins titles. There\u2019s the satisfaction of having emerged from a battle, the enjoyment of the epic over the academic. \u201cThis is a team with faith,\u201d Luis Enrique says, even if he admits: \u201cI prefer to have control and this was the complete opposite. Sometimes you get a mad game.\u201d</p> <p>And sometimes it\u2019s good that way. Very good, according Marca for whom Xavi Hernandez (no, not that one) writes: \u201cLast minute goals always feel orgasmic.\u201d Sport calls it a \u201ccomeback of gods\u201d, in which \u201cfootball beat anti-football\u201d and even Barcelona\u2019s vice-president Jordi Mestre says: \u201cI prefer this to a boring game.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt tastes better this way,\u201d Luis Su\u00e1rez insists.</p> <h2>Talking points</h2> <p>\u2022 This was a weekend of opportunity and obligation in which the six teams who\u2019ve won 81 of the 85 league championships ever played, faced each other \u2013 five of them in a top six separated by just three points. The sixth, Valencia, played their first home game under a new manager who, after pulling them from the relegation zone last week, was asked if he could take them to the Champions League. A weekend in which the the team in fifth, Villarreal, played seventh-placed Las Palmas. There was a Galician derby, too. A bit like one of those Super Saturdays or Magic Mondays then, only the football was good.</p> <p>So much for the big three walking it in Spain. Or even the big two. A last-minute winner for Barcelona, Atl\u00e9tico losing to Sevilla at the Pizju\u00e1n, and Real Madrid needing an 83rd minute goal from \u00c1lvaro Morata to beat Athletic Bilbao \u2013 after Inaki Williams could twice have ended it. On Saturday morning, Atl\u00e9tico were top. On Saturday afternoon, Barcelona were top. On Sunday evening, Sevilla were top. And by late on Sunday night, Madrid were top. Atl\u00e9tico, beaten for the first time this season, ended the weekend down in fifth. Athletic are only three points behind them. \u201cI\u2019m proud of my team,\u201d Sevilla\u2019s Jorge Sampaoli said.</p> <p>\u2022 The Athletic Bilbao coach, Ernesto Valverde, again demonstrated the class so few others do. He admitted it was hard for him to believe his team deserved to lose at the Bernab\u00e9u, but then when he was pushed as to whether a different result would have been \u201cfair\u201d (real answer: probably, yeah), he replied: \u201cNo, look: I\u2019m the Athletic manager and I see it from our perspective \u2013 ask Zidane and he will probably say differently.</p> <p>\u2022 There were 33 goals this weekend but none so good this week or in fact any week than the one scored by Kevin-Prince Boateng for Las Palmas at Villarreal. A beautiful move that began with 18 passes from one end of the pitch to the other and ended with a lovely dinked ball into the box from Viera, a lovelier volleyed backheel assist, and an even lovelier volleyed finish from Boateng. That put Las Palmas into the lead but it was not enough. A last-minute goal for C\u00e9dric Bakambu gave Villarreal a 2-1 victory after a very ropey penalty had allowed Nicola Sansone to make it 1-1. \u201cIt\u2019s not the first time,\u201d Quique Setien spat. \u201cAnd I would like to know, if it was the other way round, whether the referee would have the balls to give it? There\u2019s no respect for the teams lower down.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 Diego Simeone didn\u2019t wear a suit and Atl\u00e9tico lost for the first time. Now, that may be a coincidence, but Atl\u00e9tico lost for the first time too. What\u2019s not coincidence is the way Sevilla performed in a 1-0 victory that was clinched with Stephen N\u2019Zonzi releasing his inner Kanout\u00e9, striding through to score the only goal of a game that was intense and fascinating in the rain at the Pizju\u00e1n. Atl\u00e9tico, playing more on the counter than in previous matches, and with Griezmann everywhere again, were not at their best but certainly weren\u2019t awful and could have won it: Correa scuffed the clearest chance.</p> <p>But Sevilla were superb, producing their best performance of the season. N\u2019Zonzi was fantastic and so, yet again, was Samir Nasri, playing all over the midfield and always willing to drop into a deep slightly left-sided position to get them moving. It was from there he produced the move of the game with a superb turn, determined run, two lovely one-twos and a shot against the post. \u201cThis game will show us where we are,\u201d the Sevilla striker Luciano Vietto had said. The answer, then, is: in a very good place. \u201cThis was an important game to consolidate what we are doing and to build our identity,\u201d Sampaoli said. So what is that identity? \u201cTo have no fear, don\u2019t wait, to think more about their goal than ours.\u201d Sounds good. Looks good too.</p> <p>\u2022 Granada and Sporting were, well, kind of Granada and Sporting.</p> <p>\u2022 Andres Iniesta will be out for six to eight weeks, which may not sound like good news, but is actually great news. The way his knee jerked backwards and the way he called for assistance immediately had everyone fearing the worse.</p> <p><strong>Results: </strong>Osasuna 1\u20132 Betis, Espanyol 3\u20133 Eibar, Valencia 2\u20133 Barcelona, Real Sociedad 3\u20130 Alav\u00e9s, Granada 0\u20130 Sporting, Celta 4\u20131 Deportivo, Sevilla 1\u20130 Atl\u00e9tico, Villarreal 2\u20131 Las Palmas, M\u00e1laga 4\u20130 Legan\u00e9s, Real Madrid 2\u20131 Athletic.</p>",

Next to \u201cModus\u201d, he wrote \u201cAny!!\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f5bfdd776511a81e296cc3dd92ddd1568387747e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f5bfdd776511a81e296cc3dd92ddd1568387747e/0_55_3189_1913/1000.jpg\" alt=\"eBay listing created by Michael Danaher for the first edition of The Wind in the Willows he stole from Adrian Greenwood.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">eBay listing created by Michael Danaher for the first edition of The Wind in the Willows he stole from Adrian Greenwood.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Thames Valley Police/PA Wire</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Also included on the list, which Danaher called Enterprises, were the model Kate Moss and the Conservative peer Jeffrey Archer, along with a number of wealthy business figures, among them prominent Conservative party donors. Under \u201creason\u201d, several were marked \u201cTory\u201d or \u201cscum Tory\u201d.</p> <p>Danaher also searched for the home addresses of celebrities including Eamonn Holmes, Louise Redknapp and Michael Parkinson and other \u201cpeople of means\u201d. A floorplan of the home of the TV presenter Anthea Turner was also found on his laptop. </p> <p>Danaher\u2019s internet history showed he had looked up how to buy samurai swords, regulations on owning rifles, \u201copening locks without keys\u201d and \u201cthe technique of silent killing\u201d. </p> <p>In a bizarre defence, he attempted to claim it was not him but another man \u2013 whom he would not name for fear of \u201cconsequences\u201d \u2013 that had carried out the searches and drawn up the list. This man would come and go from his Peterborough flat at all hours of the day and night, Danaher claimed, and had full use of his mobile phone and laptop. </p> <p>Occasionally, Danaher said, he would lend the man his phone and car, which he claimed explained why both had been traced to the home of the wealthy businessman Adrian Beecroft, when a man had tried to force his way in while disguised as a delivery driver. He fled when Beecroft\u2019s wife screamed for help.</p> <p>After the killing, Danaher took the copy of The Wind in the Willows back to his flat in Peterborough and showed it to his son, before listing it for sale on eBay just hours after the killing. </p> <p>He was arrested after phone records and numberplate scanning traced Greenwood\u2019s mobile and Danaher\u2019s Citro\u00ebn Picasso car to Peterborough. The broken murder weapon and a pair of bloodied boots were found at his flat, along with a stun gun, disguised as an iPhone. <br></p>",
  "<p>News that Warner Bros is to release <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/oct/21/prince-vaults-purple-rain-expanded-album-edition-4ever\">a deluxe, posthumous version of Purple Rain</a>, twice the original length \u2013 and that Prince planned the project before he died \u2013 has turned the music world febrile. Collaborators say there\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/mar/19/i-would-hide-4-u-whats-in-princes-secret-vault\">a vault of unreleased songs that constitute 70% of Prince\u2019s oeuvre</a>, so his estate looks set to be flush for decades to come. If so, he would not be the first artist to trust posterity more than he trusted contemporary taste.</p> <p>Beethoven, upon finding that no musician in Vienna could play his string quartets, <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/books/what-to-read/beethoven-for-a-later-age-by-edward-dusinberre-review-tantalisin/\">told a frustrated violinist</a>: \u201cThey are not for you, but for a later age.\u201d The Alexandrian poet CP Cavafy, who died in 1932, comprehensively suppressed the erotic poems he is now famous for. Kafka ordered that all his manuscripts be burned upon his death \u2013 an order, thankfully, defied.</p> <p>In general, the historic pattern was: in an artist\u2019s lifetime, creative work gets filtered through what taste and the market can withstand. After they are dead, and adjudged to be great, the market becomes very eager to commercialise their unpublished work. The work\u2019s value is boosted by the fact that, being dead, they are unable to produce any more stuff, creating instant scarcity.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/oct/25/paisley-park-minnesota-to-become-permanent-prince-museum\">Prince's Paisley Park granted permission to become permanent museum</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It was David Bowie who, in 1997, first understood that technology might be about to disrupt the old pattern. In a pioneering financial arrangement, Bowie securitised the projected income on his already-published music \u2013 meaning he took a loan of $55m (then \u00a333m) against his future royalties, in return for 8% annual interest over 10 years. His motivation was that, with the arrival of the internet, royalties on recorded music would probably diminish \u2013 so better to get them sooner rather than later.</p> <p>It\u2019s known that Prince consulted David Pullman, who designed the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-35280945\">so-called Bowie bond</a>, not long after Bowie\u2019s deal was publicised. Pullman has told reporters he thinks Prince\u2019s unsold songs might be worth up to $100m. But there was no \u201cPrince bond\u201d. Prince\u2019s estate seems likely to trickle out the material over several years, extracting maximum value not just from the music but from his image.</p> <p>If so, in addition to inventing an entire musical genre, Prince may go down as the inventor of post-death capitalism. He turned the logic of the Bowie bond on its head and did something far more interesting.</p> <p>For an economy based increasingly on intellectual property, copyright laws are crucial. The conglomerates who own the major music and movie studios have, over time, managed to extend the life of copyright to \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.copyright.gov/circs/circ15a.pdf\">in the US </a>\u2013 life plus 70 years. If the creator is a \u201ccorporate body\u201d, the term extends to 120 years from the creation date. But what if I am a corporate body who intends to publish my work at a later date? And how can corporate bodies \u201cdie\u201d?</p> <p>Copyright law on unpublished stuff generally relates to archives \u2013 notes, diaries, rough drafts, early scripts \u2013 in analogue form. But who is to say whether Prince, <a href=\"http://www.princevault.com/index.php?title=Good_Dick_And_A_Job\">meandering through a solo song called Good Dick and a Job</a> in 1995, meant this as a first draft or a finished work? He \u201cpremiered\u201d the recording at a party on 19 May 1995 but never performed it live.</p> <p>Ask these questions and the long-term potential of Prince\u2019s strange modus operandi becomes clear. The unreleased song archive could, if his estate wants, remain artificially scarce for 120 years. It is possible to imagine that the hype will be considerable in the year 2136, when the last Prince album is released. So, behind the white walls of his Minnesota mansion, Prince may have pioneered a form of information capitalism much more sophisticated than Bowie\u2019s, and greatly more far sighted than the contracts designed by studio lawyers.</p> <p>Prince \u2013 almost uniquely among major artists \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/cover-story/7348551/prince-battle-to-control-career-artist-rights\">owned the masters of his recordings</a>. In the studio system, when you sell a song to a label, you get writer\u2019s royalties and performance royalties but you alienate the property rights to the master recording itself. By eschewing this, Prince \u2013 even with his published work \u2013 retained a much greater proportion of its value for himself.</p> <p>On top of that, it seems by his own admission, he \u201cdidn\u2019t always give the studio the best song\u201d. Indeed, he trailed unreleased songs by naming them in interviews and sleeve notes for the published albums. And then, having meticulously created this treasure trove, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/apr/26/prince-death-will-business-assets\">he left no will</a>. He created scarcity, interest and quality in the unpublished work \u2013 but showed no interest in how it would be exploited. He even, reportedly, joked that it should be destroyed.</p> <p>Prince, in short, committed a giant act of defiance of the commercial conventions of pop music \u2013 compared with which renaming himself as a symbol mid-career looks like child\u2019s play. He knew all too well, after the 1990s, that he could have converted the whole oeuvre into a Bowie bond. But he did the opposite. He secured the property rights to his music and then just left it there, for others to work out when, where and at what price it should be commercialised.</p> <p>We live in an age when those who mediate between artists and money always want to know: who is it for? Who is the target audience? Who will pay to consume it? This is as true in TV drama, Arts Council-funded theatre and the global art market \u2013 even if the question gets asked in more subtle ways. Allied to that is the legitimate question: what will the artwork change? What is its impact going to be?</p> <p>Prince\u2019s vault reads like a top lip curled in defiance to all that. It reminds us that an artist, if they want to, can just create for themselves. And having created, they can dump the problem of what it means, what it changes and who it communicates with on to those who outlive them.</p> <p>As to money, once he had created a revenue stream from the published work sufficient for the upkeep of his quirky lifestyle, Prince seems to have lost interest in the problem of commercialising his output. That\u2019s somebody else\u2019s problem now.</p>",
  "<h2>\u2018WHO ARE YOU? WHO, WHO, WHO, WHO?\u2019</h2> <p>These are strange times indeed. In a world when the bloke who wants to be president can not just look down a camera and tell lies, but look down a camera and tell lies that can be very easily disproved, it\u2019s perhaps no wonder Jos\u00e9 Mourinho still thinks his old distraction tricks will work. After Manchester United were so thoroughly hosed by Chelsea on Sunday, the 4-0 scoreline offering not so much a clue as to where Mourinho\u2019s team are currently, as a glimpse into the echoey void <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/23/jose-mourinho-rages-manchester-united-incredible-mistakes-chelsea\">where his soul used to be</a>, the main question became this: what would the erstwhile winner of trophies use to distract attention from their performance? He probably couldn\u2019t have a go at an underling, because not even Mourinho plays the same song twice and anyway, that sort of thing can end up in court. Not the best idea to blame the whole thing on United having three games in seven days while Chelsea were nice and rested up, because people might then remember whose fault it is that they were free in a European week. Bawling out the referee could have been a good one but that\u2019s a bit pass\u00e9 these days.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/23/jose-mourinho-rages-manchester-united-incredible-mistakes-chelsea\">Jos\u00e9 Mourinho accuses Antonio Conte of humiliating him after Chelsea defeat</a> </p> </aside>  <p>So he had to think of something else. He did have quite a long time to mull things over, as he basically declared the game over after Pedro\u2019s first-minute goal, as though nobody had ever conceded early in a game before. In the end his solution was creative, to whisper into Antonio Conte\u2019s ear in full view of everyone, then act all coy when people asked what he had to say. Alas for Jos\u00e9 and his commitment to the secrecy of private conversations, someone was able to earwig and ascertain that he had boldly grabbed the concept of irony, torn it up, thrown it on the floor and set it on fire, as he complained to Conte about his touchline etiquette. He could not have displayed less self-awareness if he\u2019d accused Conte of wearing rubbish coats these days and not being as good as he used to be.</p> <p>The Fiver did quite enjoy Conte\u2019s reaction to this latest slice of Mourinho horse plop, regarding his rival with a vague bafflement rather than the annoyance and even anger one might expect. Conte just seemed to peer at Mourinho with a sense of curiosity, wondering exactly what this buffoon was talking about. Still, the good news is that Mourinho\u2019s attempt at deflection doesn\u2019t seem to have worked. Most people seem to be discussing his comments only in the context of how much of a berk they made him look, and devoting the rest of the time to how achingly terrible his side was.</p> <p>It might reach the point soon, if it hasn\u2019t already, that these hunks of bullsh!t are the only things remaining of the old Mourinho, the only things we have to identify the man who used to persuade players to run through fire for him. Once a fearless manager of egos and man who created thrillingly effective teams, he\u2019s now the bloke who can\u2019t work out what to do with the most expensive midfielder in the world. Nowadays his nonsense and the little JM on his jacket are among the few things that identify him, whereas they used to be mere by-products of his personality.

The study suggests that telling small, insignificant lies desensitises the brain to dishonesty, meaning that lying gradually feels more comfortable over time.</p> <p>Tali Sharot, a neuroscientist at University College London and senior author, said: \u201cWhether it\u2019s evading tax, infidelity, doping in sports, making up data in science or financial fraud, deceivers often recall how small acts of dishonesty snowballed over time and they suddenly found themselves committing quite large crimes.\u201d</p> <p>Sharot and colleagues suspected that this phenomenon was due to changes in the brain\u2019s response to lying, rather than simply being a case of one lie necessitating another to maintain a story.</p> <p>In the study, published on Monday in the journal <a href=\"http://nature.com/articles/doi:10.1038/nn.4426\">Nature Neuroscience</a>, 80 volunteers played a game in which they estimated the value of pennies in a jar and sent their guess to an unseen partner. Sometimes participants were told they would secretly benefit at their partner\u2019s expense if they overestimated the cash in the jar, incentivising them to lie.</p> <p>Neil Garrett, also of UCL and a co-author, said: \u201cWe knew by how many British pounds they lied on each trial. The amount by which participants lied got larger and larger.\u201d</p> <p>At first, volunteers tended to alter the jar\u2019s value by around \u00a31, but this typically ramped up to about \u00a38 by the end of the session.</p> <p>Twenty-five of the volunteers played the game while having their brain activity monitored by an MRI scanner. This showed that the amygdala, a part of the brain linked with emotion, was most active when people told their first lie. But while the untruths escalated in magnitude, the amygdala\u2019s response gradually declined - and larger drops in brain activity predicted bigger lies in future.</p> <p>The researchers said this adaptation effect was similar to those seen in basic sensory experiences. A scent becomes less potent when smelt repeatedly, for instance.</p> <p>\u201cYou can imagine cheating a bit like perfume,\u201d said Sharot. The first time you cheat on your taxes you feel quite bad, she added, but if you get away with it and benefit this bad behaviour is reinforced and the next time it doesn\u2019t feel quite so bad, leading you to cheat even more.</p> <p>Professor Marcus Raichle, a neurologist of the Washington School of Medicine in St Louis who was not involved in the work, said that lying was probably a learnt behaviour. \u201cIt\u2019s a nice study... It seems reasonable that if you develop a pattern of behaviour and it\u2019s reinforced that you would return to that habit,\u201d he said. \u201cAn interesting question is whether there would be interventions to un-train somebody. If you\u2019re a chronic liar that\u2019s really a problem for society.\u201d</p> <p>He added that there was little prospect of converting the findings into a more accurate lie detection test - in fact, the variation over time in the brain\u2019s response to lying demonstrates how difficult it would be to come up with a universal test. \u201cLie detection using fMRI isn\u2019t ready for prime time,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The scientists speculate that the amygdala activity could represent the internal conflict between wanting to see oneself as honest and being tempted to act in self-interest by lying. This would fit with the scientists\u2019 observation that people appeared to lie more readily in tasks where it benefited both themselves and their partner - possibly because it was easier to justify a lie that served the common good.<br></p>",

  "<p>Chinese electronics firm Xiongmai is initiating a product recall after the enormous hacking attack that took down much of the internet on the eastcoast of the US and also affected Europe on Friday.</p> <p>The root of the attack, which took the form of a distributed denial of service attack (DDoS), was a network of hacked \u201cInternet of Things\u201d devices, such as webcams and digital recorders, many of which were made by Xiongmai.</p> <p>Researchers have accused the firm of shipping its products with basic security errors, such as the inability to set a password on some forms of connection, which led to them being co-opted into the \u201cMirai\u201d botnet, a multimillion-strong network of hacked devices.</p> <p>After the accusations, Xiongmai announced a recall of some its products sold in the US.</p> <p>The electronics components firm, which makes parts for surveillance cameras, said in a statement on its official microblog that it would recall some of its earlier products sold in the United States, strengthen password functions and send users a patch for products made before April last year. <br></p> <p>It said the biggest issue was users not changing default passwords, adding that, overall, its products were well protected from cyber security breaches. It said reports that its products made up the bulk of those targeted in the attack were false. </p> <p>\u201cSecurity issues are a problem facing all mankind. Since industry giants have experienced them, Xiongmai is not afraid to experience them once, too,\u201d the company statement said. </p> <p>Friday\u2019s cyber attack alarmed security experts because it represented a new type of threat rooted in the proliferation of simple digital devices such as webcams. These often lack proper security, and hackers found a way to harness millions of them to flood a target with so much traffic that it couldn\u2019t cope. </p> <p>The main products Xiongmai is to recall are all webcam models, it said.</p> <p>Speaking to the security journalist Brian Krebs, researcher Zach Wikholm of Flashpoint said that there were basic security errors in a number of the vulnerable devices. \u201cThe issue with these particular devices is that a user cannot feasibly change this password,\u201d <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2016/10/hacked-cameras-dvrs-powered-todays-massive-internet-outage/#more-36754\">Wikholm<strong> </strong>told Krebs</a>. \u201cThe password is hardcoded into the firmware, and the tools necessary to disable it are not present. Even worse, the web interface is not aware that these credentials even exist.\u201d</p> <p>The Mirai malware which is used to create the botnet can be cleared by simply restarting affected devices. But there are so many hacked devices on the internet that a vulnerable system will likely be reinfected within five minutes of restarting, unless some other protection is put in place. </p> <p>The hacker who first wrote the code for seizing control of vulnerable devices released the source code to the public in October, allowing other opportunistic attackers to enslave their own networks of hacked webcams, routers and digital video recorders. </p>",
  "<p>The future of Britain\u2019s steel industry has been thrown into fresh uncertainty after the man in charge of Indian conglomerate Tata Group, which controls the Port Talbot steelworks in south Wales, was unexpectedly ousted.</p> <p>Cyrus Mistry will be replaced as chairman of Tata Sons, the holding company of Tata Group, by the man he succeeded as boss in 2012, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/mar/28/automotive.mergersandacquisitions\">Ratan Tata</a>. This means that control of Tata is back with its founding family. Ratan Tata will serve as interim chairman while the conglomerate looks for a permanent replacement for Mistry.</p> <p>The exit of Mistry comes as Tata Steel is deep in negotiations with German company ThyssenKrupp about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/11/hopes-rise-for-tata-steel-rescue-deal\">merging their European steel operations</a>. </p> <p>Tata Steel is also in talks with the UK government about financial support for Tata Steel UK, which employs 11,000 people, and a restructuring of its pension scheme. Tata Steel has warned that Tata Steel UK will only be included in a deal with ThyssenKrupp if talks with the government are constructive.</p> <p>Mistry has been at the heart of these negotiations. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/20/business-secretary-greg-clark-crisis-talks-tata-steel-bosses-unions\">Greg Clark, the business secretary,</a> and his predecessor Sajid Javid have each flown to Mumbai <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/05/teel-crisis-sajid-javid-tata-sanjeev-gupta-port-talbot-cyrus-mistry\">seeking assurances over the future of Tata Steel</a>.</p> <p>The fate of Tata Steel UK has been unclear since the Indian company announced in March that it was reviewing its European steel operations. If deals can be reached with ThyssenKrupp and the government then the Port Talbot steelworks and its other key sites will be saved, but unions have criticised the time it has taken for Tata to confirm its plans.</p> <p>Sources close to Tata said Mistry was leaving because of a \u201clack of performance\u201d across the group, which also owns Jaguar Land Rover, Tetley Tea and a string of other diverse brands.</p> <p>Analysts and investors in India were shocked by the move. Tata has become renowned for its long-term outlook and stability, with Ratan Tata spending more than two decades as chairman before stepping aside for Mistry.</p> <p>In a brief statement, the Mumbai-based Tata said on Monday that Mistry was stepping down after a \u201cdecision was taken at a board meeting held here today\u201d.</p> <p>The 148-year-old company gave no public reason for the surprise departure of Mistry after four years in charge. Tata said its committee would aim to find a new chairman within four months.<br></p> <p>Mistry, 48, joined Tata\u2019s board in 2006 and was Ratan Tata\u2019s choice to succeed him when he retired in 2012. Mistry\u2019s father, Pallonji Shapoorji Mistry, owns 18.5% of Tata, making him the biggest single shareholder of a company whose shares are mostly owned by family trusts.

A laudable goal of course, but as truth after sober truth unfurls on the website it feels like being repeatedly told that Father Christmas doesn\u2019t exist. You know in your heart that this information is correct, but you don\u2019t really want to hear it. Sure, you\u2019ll come out the other side wiser and more mature, but also sadder; carrying with you the dull, adult ache of acceptance. The world is somehow a less joyful, more utilitarian place when you know that tap water is just as effective as cleaning cuts and grazes as sterile saline solution, or that hooking yourself up to a drip after an epic bender will not make you feel any better (although it does make for a great Instagram post).</p> <p>Doing nothing when it comes to our health is not a palatable idea. We live in the age of intervention, when the most important thing in life is to do something, anything, everything \u2013 to have control over our own destiny. This way of thinking has spawned a million lifestyle bloggers, thousands of wellness apps, and more photographs of avocado on toast than could ever be necessary.</p> <p>And there are some extremely serious \u2013 and uncomfortable \u2013 truths outlined by the academy. Palliative chemotherapy \u2013 sometimes used to shrink tumours or eliminate distressing symptoms \u2013 may not be the best course of action for terminal cancer patients, for example. Chemotherapy is toxic, and the academy says it may do more harm than good and can raise false hopes.</p> <p>The truth is that many aspects of life are simply uncontrollable. Ageing, infertility, death and disease \u2013 even broken bones \u2013 are most often out of our hands. And hearing this news now, post-Brexit, when unemployment, housing and the economy are looking so precarious is an added kick in the teeth. When things are this bad, we want the illusion of control at least.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Who wants to tell a hopeful, expectant and possibly angry patient that 'nothing' is the answer?</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I speak as someone who last week spent \u00a370 on supplements in my local health food shop, in an almost certainly useless attempt to turn the clock back and coax my ovaries, ravaged by the chemotherapy I had five years ago, into spitting out one or two final, viable eggs. This was after being told by a consultant that I was extremely unlikely to be able to conceive. Did I accept the news stoically and quietly? Did I thank my lucky stars that at least I was alive, and feel grateful? Of course not. I whipped out my phone and began combing message boards and medical journals, downloading papers, buying books and noting down names of supplements I had never heard of. Doing nothing in the face of life\u2019s black humour feels defeatist.</p> <p>\u201cYou can\u2019t put a price on health can you!\u201d I said like a lunatic in the shop, embarrassed to be spending so much on what could be quite possibly be snake oil. Well, yes, you can: \u00a370 in my case. It should also be noted that the consultant did not tell me to do nothing either. Despite the diminishing odds of IVF and my advancing age, there were \u201coptions\u201d, she said. I didn\u2019t ask what they were as I have a fair idea (donor eggs; surrogacy; <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0090563/\" title=\"\">Betty Blue</a>-style madness) and I am not a millionaire. Infertility is a field ripe for doing something rather than nothing. A perfect convergence of the unbearable sadness of longing for a child, coupled with advances in technology and a faint ray of hope. It was a private clinic, and I felt like a walking wallet rather than a patient.</p> <p>Choosing Wisely, however, addresses things that are more prosaic. It was launched in part to address the fact, revealed in a study carried out last year, that 83% of doctors said they had prescribed or carried out a treatment that they knew to be unnecessary. Well sure \u2013 they\u2019re only human. Who wants to tell a hopeful, expectant and possibly angry patient that \u201cnothing\u201d is the answer?</p> <p>Surely medical professionals have been merrily x-raying backs and putting feet in plaster casts and so on because on some level these things make patients feel good.

It said there were 49 unaccompanied children aged 13 and under at the camp eligible to come to the UK. <br></p> <p>Unaccompanied minors are believed to be the only group staying in Calais, where they will be taken to containers within a secure area of the camp previously used to house adults.

  "<p>Let\u2019s face it: Email is killing our productivity. The average person checks their inbox 11 times per hour, processes 122 messages a day, and spends 28 percent of their total workweek managing their inbox.

Glei</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>What\u2019s more, scientists have established a clear link between spending time on email and stress: the more frequently we check our email, the more frazzled we feel. Disturbed by how much emotional baggage we carry around in relation to email, I decided to investigate the brain chemistry that feeds our email addiction\u2014and how we can regain control of our inboxes\u2014for my new book <a href=\"http://jkglei.com/unsubscribe\"><em>Unsubscribe</em></a>. </p> <p>Based on what I learned, here are a few quick tips on how to kill email anxiety so that you can spend more time on meaningful work:</p> <ol> <li><strong>Check</strong><strong> your email in \u201cbatches\u201d for less stress and more happiness.</strong> There are two types of emailers: reactors, who rely on notifications and near-constant monitoring of their inboxes to nibble away at their email throughout the day, and batchers, who set aside specific chunks of time to power through their email so they can ignore it the rest of the day. Not surprisingly, batchers are significantly more effective when it comes to getting things done, and according to <a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~gmark/Home_page/Research_files/CHI%2016%20Email%20Duration.pdf\">recent research</a>, they\u2019re also less stressed.</li> <li><strong>Neutralize your \u201cfear of missing out\u201d by using VIP email notifications.</strong> If you\u2019d like to stick to specific blocks of time for checking email but you have a special someone who will freak out if you don\u2019t tend to their email within five minutes of receiving it, compromise by using VIP notifications. On an iPhone, you can <a href=\"http://www.howtogeek.com/208904/how-to-only-get-notifications-for-emails-you-care-about-on-your-iphone/\">designate certain people as VIPs</a>, so whenever you get an email from them you get a special push notification. The Gmail app and Android phones have similar options for <a href=\"http://www.techlicious.com/how-to/never-miss-an-important-email-on-your-smartphone/\">designating priority senders</a>. Then you\u2019re freed up to ignore your email without worrying you\u2019ll miss something crucial.</li> <li><strong>Let go of \u201cinbox zero\u201d and use the 80/20 rule instead.</strong> Simply put, the 80/20 rule is the idea that 20% of the work you do will generate 80% of the impact. This carries over to email: Contemplate the idea that about only about 1 in 5 emails are really going to make a meaningful impact in the work that really matters to you. Then get strategic about how to get rid of all the noise: Could you use Gmail\u2019s <a href=\"http://time.com/12436/quick-gmail-trick-pre-write-email-messages-with-canned-responses/\">canned responses</a> to template some of your replies? Would it be useful to use <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=easily+do+email&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8\">EasilyDo Email</a>\u2019s amazing one-touch \u201cunsubscribe\u201d feature to ruthlessly clear out all those promotional emails cluttering your inbox? Are there certain emails that don\u2019t even warrant a reply?</li> </ol> <p>Getting over email anxiety\u2014and being productive in this Age of Distraction\u2014is all about learning how to set boundaries and say no. I\u2019ll be going into more depth on just how to accomplish this in my <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/guardian-masterclasses/2016/oct/12/a-masterclass-in-productivity-how-to-kill-email-overload-and-get-real-work-done\">masterclass on 16 November</a> that will be full of insightful tips on why email is so uniquely addictive coupled with actionable strategies for taming your inbox anxiety and productivity hacks to help you keep your meaningful work front and center every single day. </p> <p>I believe that it\u2019s time to let go of inbox zero. To admit that it\u2019s an addictive game rather than a meaningful goal. To release ourselves from the anxiety of trying to respond to everything in a world where the amount of updates, inquiries, and requests we receive in a single day could easily consume our time and attention for a week. In a digital world, reciprocity is a losing game.</p> <p>Productivity is no longer about keeping up, or keeping busy, or having it all. It\u2019s about being deliberate and being focused. It\u2019s about spending more time <em>deciding</em> and less time <em>doing</em>. It\u2019s about getting really clear on what matters to you and letting the rest go.</p> <p>Your unread message count is not an audit of your productivity. (Zero, quite literally, means nothing.) With email\u2014as with everything else in life\u2014you must say \u201cno\u201d to some opportunities, in order to say \u201cyes\u201d to your priorities. </p> <p><strong><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/guardian-masterclasses/2016/oct/12/a-masterclass-in-productivity-how-to-kill-email-overload-and-get-real-work-done\">A masterclass in productivity: How to kill email overload and get real work done</a> took place at the Guardian offices in London on Wednesday 16 November, 2016.

My name is Dinitha Rathnayake and I am a radio journalist based in Colombo. In this episode of the global development podcast I\u2019ll speak to people who lived through the 80s malaria epidemic and the doctors, health workers and officials who waged the war to eliminate the disease.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/sep/05/sri-lanka-malaria-free-world-health-organisation\">World Health Organisation declares Sri Lanka malaria-free</a> </p> </aside>  <p> Sri Lanka\u2019s relationship with malaria has been a long one.</p> <p><strong> HDBH</strong> Sri Lanka is a country endemic to malaria and malaria has been in this country for the past many millennia probably. My name is Dr HDB Herath, consultant in public health, and now currently serving as the director [of the] Anti-Malaria Campaign. </p> <p> Historical and archaeological findings indicate that the shifting of capitals of Sri Lanka has been partly due to the foreign invasions and similar political reasons; but on the other hand, the disease malaria also helped play the important role in deciding on it.</p> <p><strong> DR</strong> In the 20th century the spread of malaria continued.</p> <p><strong> HDBH</strong> We had a massive epidemic of malaria in and around 1935 where 80,000 deaths were reported and over five million cases were reported. At that time the total population of Sri Lanka dipped down and the number of deaths exceeded the number of births, so that was a huge epidemic.</p> <p><strong> DR</strong> It was around this time that the Red Cross was established in Sri Lanka. Mahieash Johnney is the senior communication manager.</p> <p><strong> MJ</strong> The British colonial government at that time wanted to fight this malaria epidemic, but they did not have the resources nor did they have the ability or the amount of people in order to go into households, go into villages, go into areas where they have been affected. Information was not available to them at hand like today. </p> <p> So it was the People\u2019s Movement \u2013 which has to go from house to house \u2013 sits down with them, explains [to] them this how you get malaria, this is how you safeguard yourself. If you have these kind of symptoms, this is exactly what you need to do.</p> <p><strong> DR</strong> Malaria was dramatically reduced in the 1940s after the introduction of house spraying with DDT and again in the 1950s with the launch of a national spraying programme. And according to the organisation the Anti-Malaria Campaign, by the early 60s, it had almost been totally eradicated.</p> <p> But, the success of the campaigns prompted the government to direct financial support away from prevention programmes and this, at least in part, resulted in the disease making a reappearance towards the end of the decade.</p> <p> In 1983 civil war broke out, predominantly affecting the north and east district of the country. Infrastructure in those areas crumbled and health facilities became less accessible and, as a result, the number of malaria cases rose sharply. Thelge Somapala Peris recalls his experience.</p> <p><strong> TSP</strong> In the 1980s I got malaria four times in total with a three- to four-month gap during the year. My sister was living in Polonnaruwa and she visited us. Unfortunately she too got malaria. My home town is Mathura. Most of my wife\u2019s relations visited and they all got malaria. We also might have lost our [lives] in those days but luckily we were young and we were capable [of fighting] the disease.</p> <p><strong> DR</strong> Kaluappuge Karunawathi and her family lived in Jaya Gaga Junction in the North Central Province. </p> <p><strong> KK</strong> We all got it in our family. My husband, me, everyone. I was so upset when my children got the disease as they were at the ages of two to three. When you get malaria you get a serious spine pain, headache, numbness in hands with fever. I couldn\u2019t get up from the bed, slept throughout the day. According to the medical doctors they gave 10 tablets to take continuously in the morning and evenings.</p> <p><strong> DR</strong> Dr Anula Wijesundere worked in Polonnaruwa Base Hospital from 1986 to 1989.</p> <p><strong> AW</strong> It is much better. About 35% of the wall admissions to my ward, both the paediatric and the medical ward, were due to malaria. Now these people from the hill country had no immunity from malaria at all, being in hill country. So when they came to the North Central Province which had a lot of malaria, then these new people, new settlers, developed malaria. They got severe attacks and they developed very high parasite count, and malaria became a real epidemic during this period.</p> <p><strong> DR</strong> In response to the epidemic, the Anti-Malaria Campaign decided to shift their emphasis from eradication to control of the disease and launched eight regional programmes.</p> <p> Kaluappuge Karunawathi remembers what that time was like for the people who lived in her region.</p> <p><strong> KK</strong> Those days there were officers who maintained our surroundings. They made several projects to eradicate this disease. At times it was very difficult for us as the government officers came to spray kind of an oil to kill the mosquitoes every two weeks. We got to pull all our household outside the house. Patients who suffered from malaria were in queues in hospitals to obtain the specific medicine. Some of them came from afar. Some of them didn\u2019t have enough money to purchase the prescribed medicines from the pharmacy. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/gallery/2016/jul/26/mangroves-and-incomes-flourish-as-sri-lankas-women-promote-conservation-in-pictures\">Mangroves and incomes flourish as Sri Lanka's women promote conservation \u2013 in pictures</a> </p> </aside>  <p> People who were far came by tractors to hospitals as there were no transportation facilities. Hospital beds were overflowed with patients. Initially we were not aware that this was malaria. But afterwards we were made aware by the medical doctors that we all have got the disease malaria.</p> <p><strong> DR</strong> Over the course of the next two decades the programmes addressed the unique conditions for malaria transmission in each region.</p> <p> SR Jayanettti from the Sri Lanka Anti-Malaria Campaign started work in his region in 2002. </p> <p><strong> SRJ</strong> Malaria was a big public health problem during those days. One of the areas affected mainly was this area, the Nallamudawa area, because it has a unique condition for malaria transmission \u2013 because it has a lot of quarry pits and the malaria vector prefers sunlit pools.</p> <p> So we had to do lot of things. We had to control the vector, we had to treat the people, we had to conduct a lot of mobile clinics, monthly intervals and we had to follow the patients to see whether [there were] any treatment failures.</p> <p><strong> DR</strong> Gradually, the number of cases, at least in non-conflict areas, decreased, and Sri Lanka was able to control the spread of malaria. However the internal conflict made it impossible to reach some of the affected regions, and so it was to be a few years before a programme for elimination could begin.</p> <p> In 2009 president Mahinda <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=President+Mahinda+Rajapaksa&amp;spell=1&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjD0KKRuOnPAhULB8AKHTQrAWYQvwUIGygA\">Rajapaksa</a> declared an end of three decades of internal conflict. The internal conflict had made the control of malaria a difficult task but following the declaration the ministry of health was able to launch a national malaria eradication programme. The plan was to eliminate the transmission of the deadliest strand of the disease by the end of 2012 and the most common by the end of 2014.</p> <p> The programme for malaria control was divided into three main strategies; the first was to address the vector mosquito by spraying pesticides such as DDT and malathion.</p> <p><strong> HDBH</strong> They were cheap, they were effective but [the] acceptance rate was very low because of the smell and the colour and staining and all of these things. </p> <p><strong> DR</strong> According to Dr Herath from the Anti-Malaria Campaign the programme faced many challenges, not least the effectiveness of insecticides.</p> <p><strong> HDBH</strong> Initially what we had \u2013 the challenges were that insecticide coverage was a very difficult task, but that was later, we managed to overcome. And then the treatment, the mosquitoes become resistant to insecticides \u2013 that was another challenge. And also the parasites become resistant to the ordinary treatment and we need to find new treatment methods. And also whenever you find a new one that means [it\u2019s] very expensive. And finally those are the initial challenges.</p> <p><strong> DR</strong> The next stage of malaria control involved managing the parasite through early detection of patients with the disease.</p> <p><strong> HDBH</strong> Catching as many patients as possible and treat them quickly so that the parasite will not go to the mosquito again. And also there are a number of people who are carrying the parasite but yet not developed the disease.</p> <p><strong> DR</strong> And in a move which the WHO called highly effective, mobile malaria clinics were set up in high transmission areas offering prompt and effective treatment.</p> <p><strong> HDBH</strong> We [went] to the villages and we [found] anybody who was having fever in the last many weeks or months and we took a blood film and treated them. We also did a unique thing where we got blood films from people who [were] coming to the hospital for other purposes. We said that probably we asked whether they had any fever in the past and then we took blood films.</p> <p> So [with] all these approaches we were able to gradually reduce the case numbers and then from there onwards, we had to maintain very good records because when it comes to the last minute, things need to be very carefully monitored.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/oct/04/story-sri-lanka-civil-war-memoir-long-watch-war-captivity-return-ajith-boyagoda\">'Whatever the army saw, they destroyed': looting and loss in Sri Lanka's civil war</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong> DR</strong> Although the target was set for 2014, in fact by 2012 Sri Lanka was free of locally transmitted malaria cases.

That is those people who are going outside from here to other countries with malaria and then they come with malaria. And also the foreigners who are coming to Sri Lanka from malarious countries. So for that we have managed to educate our doctors and we have identified high-risk people, people who are going to malarious countries, and we check them.</p> <p> The next challenge is when the disease is no longer there, the country, the government is usually having difficulties to manage or maintain the resource flow and the disease number is going down \u2013 there is a tendency to divert the existing resources to other places. So we have to educate the policy maker and others to ensure that the resource flow is maintained until the whole world eradicates malaria.</p> <p><strong> DR</strong> And Dr Anula Wijesundere believes there is a danger that not only the government, but also doctors could become complacent.</p> <p><strong> AW</strong> Because there is no malaria in Sri Lanka our doctors delay to diagnose it, to diagnose malaria. They delay it because they don\u2019t think of it. And the young doctors have not seen any case of malaria in Sri Lanka for the past five or six years. So they fail to diagnose. So one message that is very important is that if anyone comes with fever who has been abroad you have to do the blood for the malaria parasites to diagnose it early.</p> <p><strong> HDBH</strong> You try to do more publicity internationally than locally, because internationally by doing so the world will know that the country is free of malaria. More people will come to Sri Lanka, more investors will come to Sri Lanka, and that can happen. On the other hand if you do more publicity within the country people will be also complacent. So it\u2019s a challenge. You cannot hide it also. You need to give more publicity. But on the other hand more publicity may be having a bad effect as well.</p> <p><strong> DR</strong> Despite the potential pitfalls ahead for now the message to the world is loud and clear. Sri Lanka remains malaria free.</p> <p> That\u2019s all for this episode of the Global Development podcast. My name is Dinitha Rathnayake and the producer is Kary Stewart. Thank you for listening.

Clinton was secretary of state for four years during that time, and she was twice elected senator to New York before that, vocally <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-clinton-drones-idUSBRE8560N520120607\">supporting drones</a>.</p> <p>Never once did Clinton take action against drone wars, nor vocalize dissent or distaste.

I was puzzled by the silence in every room. It was the middle of the day, but all the patients were in bed. Visiting families were gathered in somber clusters on each bed. We saw almost 80 patients.</p> <p>\u201cThese are all patients with <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4070894/pdf/pone.0097939.pdf\">psychiatric disorders</a> from drone attacks.

Others have PTSD,\u201d Mufti said. </p> <p>I am familiar with these diseases as I treat 9/11 first responders in New York with PTSD and anxiety, among other disorders. Still, I was immobilized by one thought: all that these Pakistanis knew of the United States was the sound of Reapers and Predators and the lethal violence in their wake.</p> <p>If Americans elect Trump on 8 November, it is unlikely that he could undo drone wars without extraordinary effort.

  "<p>British banker Rurik Jutting allegedly subjected a 23-year-old Indonesian woman to three days of torture that he filmed on his mobile phone before killing her and another woman at his luxury Hong Kong apartment, a court has heard.</p> <p>Jutting, 31, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/24/british-banker-rurik-jutting-denies-of-two-women-in-hong-kong\">went on trial on Monday</a> for the 2014 double murder of the two migrant workers. The high court judge, Michael Stuart-Moore, warned jurors they would be shown photographs and video footage that was \u201cvery shocking indeed\u201d. </p> <p>The nine jurors were told that the Cambridge-educated banker, who had worked as a trader for Bank of America Merrill Lynch, had lured the women to his home before killing them with knives.</p> <p>John Reading, prosecuting, said Sumarti Ningsih, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-30110872\">a single mother from a village in central Java</a>, had agreed to go to Jutting\u2019s 31st-floor flat on the night of 25 October 2014 after being offered \u201ca large sum of money\u201d. </p> <p>Once inside, Ningsih, who was working in Hong Kong at the time, was subjected to \u201ccruel acts of violence\u201d involving sex toys, pliers, a belt and the defendant\u2019s fists, Reading said.

She had moved to Hong Kong looking for work and also used the name Jesse Lorena.</p> <p>Reading said Jutting, who went to school at the prestigious Winchester College, told police he had gone out that evening \u201chunting for prey, and that Miss Mujiasih was his prey\u201d.</p> <p>After going to Jutting\u2019s apartment, Mujiasih began to \u201cstruggle and shout\u201d after spotting a gag, the court heard. Jutting then allegedly cut her throat before calling police, who arrived in the early hours of 1 November and arrested him. \u201cIt seems that he was hallucinating [when they arrived],\u201d Reading reportedly told the court.</p> <p>Entering his plea on Monday morning, Jutting admitted killing the two women, who are understood to have been working as sex workers to help support their families.

  "<p>It\u2019s not very long ago that advocates for Brexit were making the forceful case that if the European Union were really serious about hanging on to the UK it would be prepared to seriously rethink what our membership would mean.

Well, if Downing Street Sources want a critique of that rhetorical approach, they would do well to ring up Vote Leave Sources from about June, who will patiently explain to them that no decent government would meekly subordinate the interests of the people it represents to some abstract appeal about the greater good of the wider union.</p> <p>In particular, the Scottish government\u2019s case for a flexible Brexit \u2013 Flexit! \u2013 for different parts of the UK may be hard to swallow, and to execute; but if there isn\u2019t at least a willingness to talk about such a step (and May has shown none), Scottish people will listen much more closely to Sturgeon\u2019s case that their interests are simply being ignored. Instead, an anglo-centric Conservative government is making tubthumping appeals to its own constituents, and putting the future of the union at risk. It\u2019s hard not to think of the spluttering apoplexy of those who thought that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/13/unilever-finance-director-graeme-pitkethly-defends-company-tesco-price-row-marmite\" title=\"\">Unilever\u2019s position on Marmite</a> was unpatriotic, or that the remaining EU nations will be doing something wicked if they choose to make it difficult for us to leave <em>pour encourager les autres</em>.

If we\u2019re going to have a bearable Brexit, this rhetorical myopia has to end quickly. And if it doesn\u2019t, the future of our own union may be just as blighted as the future of the European one.</p>",

Punching a woman in the face, dragging her by her hair, treating her like a carcass might look a bit dicey at the start, but it ends in a transport of luscious ecstasy, and really, isn\u2019t that a wheeze? When you can\u2019t quite make out whether she\u2019s dead by strangulation, or is merely spent by the emotional excesses of getting anally raped and discovering to her surprise that it\u2019s not so much a violation as an acquired taste, isn\u2019t that what being human is all about? It is not repellent for its sadism, but for the fact that it seeks to make sadists of us all, asking us to watch the suffering of a woman and enjoy it.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/oct/23/bbc-accused-of-airing-fantasy-scene-in-hit-drama-poldark\">BBC accused of airing 'rape fantasy' scene in hit drama Poldark</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Contrast that to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2015/jun/30/william-tell-gang-rape-scene-royal-opera-house\">Guillaume Tell at the Royal Opera House</a> last year, which caused booing, hissing, walk-outs, behaviour utterly outside the repertoire of opera-goers, for a rape scene in which a woman is stripped naked and gang-raped by soldiers. The scene \u2013 even the censored version I saw, in which she is covered with a sheet \u2013 is unimaginably horrible, humiliating, nauseating, like the worst account you\u2019ve read of slavery or war. </p> <p>That\u2019s exactly as it should be: unless you object to the representation of sexual violence per se (a position that would take some defending), then to represent it as it is is right. Straw Dogs, and so many other scenes like it, are culturally noxious in the first instance because when, with lighting and artistry, you turn rape into a beautiful act, you refuse to engage imaginatively with one of the people involved. The woman\u2019s perspective is entirely subjugated, her feelings only relevant in so far as they are perceived by and serve the man\u2019s.</p> <p>In sum, just because, in Poldark, the rape of Elizabeth has been prettified doesn\u2019t make it OK: it makes it better than it could have been, had it created violence to luxuriate in. But it makes it worse than it could have been, too, that it chose considerations of squeamishness and a censor\u2019s version of good taste over the demand of engaging, at a granular level, with what forced sex would actually look like. In the interests of sparing our blushes, this scene was an amalgam of classic moves: a hard kiss, a breathless \u201cno\u201d, he clasping her face in that fantasy space between force and affection, her push away turning seamlessly into its opposite, a segue into bed where miraculously everything was now cool. </p> <p>It reminded me of that bit in Friends where Rachel and Monica teach Chandler how to have sex with a diagram and some numbers: you could write this as a pre-watershed rape formula, a two, a three, a seven, a five, five, five, ending in that period drama staple, the unreadable expression. It may not sound like the first priority for feminism, to make sure the rape scenes on the BBC are fresh, but it is in originality that we see the profound attempt to empathise, without which violence is conjured in bad faith.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f32d42dc660dc732bb35ac5458526c1b5444ab5d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f32d42dc660dc732bb35ac5458526c1b5444ab5d/0_0_4236_2541/1000.jpg\" alt=\"I could live the rest of my life without seeing one more scene in which a \u2018no\u2019 becomes an unspoken \u2018yes\u2019.

The fact is, there is no ambiguity in this progression: to get to stage two, the no-longer audible \u201cno\u201d, the rapist has had to go through stage one, ignoring the \u201cno\u201d. The only way this could be construed as a grey area is if a woman\u2019s \u201cno\u201d needs extra emphasis before it has weight, needs violent struggle, extra decibels, needs to be said a score of times. <br></p> <p>It is the western cultural version of Sharia law, not that a woman needs four witnesses to be believed, but that she has to say everything four times louder, 40 times over.

  "<p>Owen Farrell is in a striking mood today. It is almost surprising to compare how relaxed and amiable he appears in contrast to the intense and often fiery man who plays for Saracens and England. There is a new lightness to Farrell, at least in the comforting surrounds of Saracens\u2019 training ground in St&#xa0;Albans, and it is only when transcribing his words that it becomes clear how a concentrated ambition beats even more strongly inside him.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2016/jun/27/how-british-irish-lions-may-line-up-new-2017-zealand-tour-england-scotland-wales-ireland\">How the British &amp; Irish Lions may line up on 2017 New Zealand tour</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Amid the chit-chat about his love of watching sport on television and moving out of home so he can be looked after by his girlfriend, the recurring theme is obvious. It resonates so often that I count 16 separate occasions when Farrell uses the words \u201cimprove\u201d, \u201cimproving\u201d and \u201cimprovement\u201d, or the short phrase of \u201cget better\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cAll we\u2019ve ever tried to do is get better,\u201d Farrell says as he shrugs off a compliment for the way in which, 10 days ago, on his return from injury, he inspired Saracens to subject Toulon <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/15/toulon-saracens-european-rugby-champions-cup-match-report\" title=\"\">to a rare lesson in attacking rugby</a>, and sealed the French club\u2019s first home defeat in the European Champions Cup. \u201cWe know what we\u2019re good at but we want to improve in every area of the game. We did well against Toulon but we were a long way from perfect.\u201d</p> <p>Farrell scored 16 points and his coach Mark McCall, who described him as the best player in Europe before the match, said: \u201cThe way Owen played was remarkable.\u201d On Saturday, in his second game since injuring his back in pre\u2011season training, Farrell kicked 19 points, and created so much space for his backline, as Saracens <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/23/saracens-scarlets-champions-cup-alex-goode\" title=\"\">completed a 44-26 European thumping of Scarlets</a>.</p> <p>\u201cI enjoy giving this everything,\u201d Farrell says simply as he relishes playing again. \u201cIt\u2019s an obsession of mine and something I love doing.\u201d</p> <p>That second sentence contains the crux of Farrell\u2019s approach while explaining how he has dealt with the tumultuous past year. Last October Farrell and English rugby were at a terrible low point after their humiliating World Cup. Twelve months on, following a grand slam <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jun/25/australia-england-third-test-match-report\" title=\"\">and a 3-0 series whitewash in Australia</a>, they have won 10 Tests in a row. Eddie Jones, the coach who sparked the transformation, hails Farrell as \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jun/25/england-dylan-hartley-australia-whitewash\" title=\"\">solar-system class</a>\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0771ffedb9d489143502a025bf9e193a19869d1a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0771ffedb9d489143502a025bf9e193a19869d1a/0_769_3648_3455/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Owen Farrell of Saracens surveys the scene after the victory over Toulon.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"947\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Owen Farrell of Saracens surveys the scene after the victory over Toulon.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Rogers/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Five months ago Farrell also won the Premiership and European Cup double with Saracens but success has sharpened his appetite. Past disappointments also underpin these achievements. Farrell remembers how, two years ago, he and Saracens endured a double blow. A week after they were crushed in the European Cup final by Toulon, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/may/31/northampton-saints-beat-saracens-premiership-final-match-report\" title=\"\">the Premiership title was snatched away</a> when Northampton were awarded a controversial try in the last minute of extra-time.</p> <p>\u201cThe disappointments probably make the big wins happen in the first place,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s not just that the lows make the highs more meaningful. They actually help you figure stuff out. You have to work out where you went wrong and what you need to do to get better. We\u2019ve done that at Saracens and obviously things have changed at England. The main thing is that we\u2019ve&#xa0;improved.\u201d</p> <p>The old southern hemisphere jibe \u2013 that England are satisfied too quickly by a few wins \u2013 is redundant in Farrell\u2019s company. As the autumn internationals loom with Tests against South Africa, Fiji, Argentina and Australia, Farrell talks plainly: \u201cWe\u2019ve still got a long way to go. We\u2019re by no means anywhere near where we want to be. Our improvement is exciting but it\u2019s not enough.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/24/rugby-union-talking-points-european-champions-cup-action\">Rugby union: talking points from the weekend's Champions Cup action</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Any temptation to get carried away is curbed by the history-making All Blacks. On Saturday New Zealand <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/22/new-zealand-make-history-beat-australia-all-blacks-18-consecutive-wins\" title=\"\">became the first team to win 18 Tests in a row</a>, beating Australia 37-10, and the gulf between them and every other rugby\u2011playing nation is obvious. Yet Farrell sounds more inspired than intimidated. \u201cThey\u2019re a brilliant side and brilliant to watch. Obviously every team is different and you don\u2019t want to try and be them. But you\u2019ve got to figure out your own way and work hard to get to that level. I saw them against South Africa [when New Zealand <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-33rIhWPVA\" title=\"\">scored nine tries while hammering the Springboks in Durban</a>] because you watch every big game and try to learn from it. New Zealand were very good. It was a clinical performance and that\u2019s the standard they\u2019ve set.\u201d</p> <p>Jones has been measured in analysing England\u2019s progress. He also enjoys his reputation as a coach whom his own players often fear. Does Farrell feel any trepidation? \u201cWhat you feel more than anything is that you want to perform. You want to do well for him. He works hard to create that environment. And we try to create it as a team \u2013 so you drive yourselves.</p> <p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t want this to come across the wrong way \u2026 but I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s comfortable playing for [Jones]. There\u2019s no way you\u2019re going to ease off.\u201d</p> <p>Before he began working with Jones had he heard about the Australian <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jan/30/eddie-jones-england-six-nations\" title=\"\">reducing some hardened Test forwards to tears</a>? \u201cYou always hear stories but I can only speak from my experience. I was here when Eddie was at Saracens [as a consultant in 2006]. I was a young lad in the academy. I actually played my first game at Saracens under him \u2013 against Scarlets. We lost.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b725df85cc430daee90804a110104fc75f15630b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b725df85cc430daee90804a110104fc75f15630b/0_90_1746_1677/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Owen Farrell makes his Saracens debut against Scarlets in October 2008\" width=\"1000\" height=\"960\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Owen Farrell makes his Saracens debut against Scarlets in October 2008.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Gichigi/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Farrell smiles as he recalls how, in October 2008, 11 days after turning 17, he became the youngest player to appear for an English Premiership club when Saracens picked him in an Anglo\u2011Welsh Cup fixture. \u201cI remember those times with Eddie really well. He was brilliant with me. Really brilliant. My experience of him then and now has been great.\u201d</p> <p>Jones can still be brutal. He picked Farrell at fly-half against Australia in June but, after 29 minutes, with Luther Burrell struggling defensively at inside centre and England 10-0 down in the first quarter, Jones made a dramatic substitution. Burrell was taken off, George Ford was sent on and Farrell moved to centre. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jun/11/australia-england-first-test-match-report\" title=\"\">England won 39-28 and Farrell scored 24 points</a>. The early replacement seemed cruel to Burrell but, in the blunt terms of Test rugby, it was justified.</p> <p>\u201cI guess it did surprise me,\u201d Farrell says. \u201cWe spoke about it afterwards but that\u2019s what needed to be done. Thankfully we ended up winning. You don\u2019t like to see that happen but while you\u2019re playing you just go: \u2018Yeah, right, let\u2019s get on with it.\u2019\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I wouldn\u2019t want this to come across the wrong way \u2026 but I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s comfortable playing for [Jones]</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In all Jones\u2019s other matches as England coach, Farrell has started at inside-centre. He retains the No10 shirt at Saracens. Does he prefer his club position? \u201cI\u2019d say so. I\u2019d say I am a fly\u2011half. As regards being 12 for England I\u2019ve not tried to play any different. I guess I\u2019ve been like another 10. Obviously you do some things differently and you might not have your hands on the ball as much \u2013 but you\u2019re still in the game and constantly communicating. You\u2019re happy to fit in wherever you\u2019re wanted.\u201d</p> <p>Any frustration Farrell feels at not being picked in his favoured role is offset by the pleasure of playing in a winning team with his close friend. \u201cOh, it\u2019s great. Me and George have played alongside each other a lot. We did all the age groups together and we\u2019re very open about how we see the game. We talk to each other and it works well.\u201d</p> <p>Farrell and Ford have similar backgrounds \u2013 the sons of rugby league men [Andy Farrell and Mike Ford] who became respected union coaches after moving from the north and ending up in the leafy Hertfordshire town of Harpenden. Apart from playing rugby together every day, either at St George\u2019s School or in the street, Ford sometimes did Farrell\u2019s French homework.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s probably cleverer than me so he would help me out,\u201d Farrell quips, \u201ceven though he was the year below me. So I like playing alongside George. The main thing is I\u2019ve tried to get better at everything \u2013 that includes the attacking side, being a threat and taking people&#xa0;on.\u201d</p> <p>Farrell has endured enough bruising defeats to make him a rounded player \u2013 but his team-mate Maro Itoje has yet to learn the same harsh lessons. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/09/maro-itoje-saracens-racing-92-european-rugby-champions-cup-final\" title=\"\">In his sensational first full season</a> with Saracens and England, Itoje did not lose a single game he started. This season Itoje\u2019s perfect record has suffered a single blemish as Saracens lost unexpectedly against Harlequins on 24 September \u2013 the then\u2011injured Farrell\u2019s 25th birthday.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"629bc8b8299f2e2ebcb37949497be63ecd988519\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/629bc8b8299f2e2ebcb37949497be63ecd988519/0_68_4000_2606/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Owen Farrell scores the winning try against Australia in Melbourne\" width=\"1000\" height=\"652\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Owen Farrell scores the winning try against Australia in Melbourne.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Scott Barbour/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Itoje is only 21 and, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/23/eddie-jones-england-maro-itoje-hand-injury\" title=\"\">despite fracturing his hand last Saturday</a> and being <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/24/maro-itoje-miss-england-autumn-internationals-fracturing-hand\" title=\"\">ruled out of the autumn internationals</a>, he must think it is easy winning Premiership, European and Test matches? \u201cYeah,\u201d Farrell says wryly, \u201cit\u2019s the norm for him.\u201d</p> <p>Winning will not last forever \u2013 it never does in sport or real life. \u201cNo, of course,\u201d Farrell says before he laughs. \u201cAlthough I hope it does for Maro because I\u2019ll be playing with him. He also went to St&#xa0;George\u2019s and ever since he\u2019s been at Saracens the most impressive thing about him is that he\u2019s took everything in his stride. He\u2019s never been in awe of anything. It doesn\u2019t matter who is in front of him, he thinks he can dominate them. He might not even think like that \u2013 he might just do it.\u201d</p> <p>Farrell and Itoje are likely to be important figures for the British and Irish Lions in New Zealand this season. Farrell is understandably more comfortable talking about the 2013 tour of Australia than speculating on his possible role against the All Blacks. \u201cI loved it,\u201d he says of the last Lions series. \u201cIt was brilliant \u2013 especially as we won. I only got on at the end [as a substitute in the decisive third Test] but to be involved in the whole thing and to play with some special players was incredible.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/23/saracens-scarlets-champions-cup-alex-goode\">Saracens close in on European record but Alex Goode seeks improvement</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Has he allowed himself to think ahead to New Zealand? \u201cNot at the minute. I\u2019ve just played my first games after injury and I\u2019ve focused on getting fit. Now I\u2019ll try my best to improve my consistency.\u201d</p> <p>Part of that improvement is built around Saracens inviting different people to address the squad. \u201cWe\u2019ve had some amazing people talk to us. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2016/sep/19/alistair-jonny-brownlee-brotherly-moment-world-best-triathletes\" title=\"\">The Brownlee brothers</a> this month and people as different as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/apr/24/tony-mccoy-broke-bones-heart-sandown-retires\" title=\"\">AP&#xa0;McCoy</a>, business guys and hostage interpreters. AP and the Brownlees have been at the top a long time and it\u2019s cool hearing how much they put into it and how much drive they have. It makes you want to have the same drive.\u201d</p> <p>Farrell has also found a way to control his temper. \u201cYeah!\u201d he exclaims. Presumably he is still boiling away on the inside? \u201cNo, no, not any more,\u201d he says, laughing. \u201cRugby is a tough game. You\u2019re never going to whisper on the field are you? I\u2019m pretty loud \u2013 but I figured out it\u2019s important being clear for 80 minutes and not switching off and having a little moment to yourself when you\u2019re going mad. As soon as I got my head round that I was fine. I\u2019ve improved.\u201d</p> <p>He flashes another grin after using his favourite word. Farrell knows we will discover how much he, Saracens and England have improved by the end of this long and testing season.</p>",

  "<p>A bakery in Northern Ireland owned by evangelical Christians has lost an appeal to overturn a conviction that found it guilty of discrimination for refusing to bake a pro-gay-marriage themed cake.</p> <p>The court of appeal in Belfast on Monday upheld a previous judgment last year that Ashers Bakery had discriminated against a customer on the grounds of sexual orientation.</p> <p>The family-owned firm in the original case was also ordered to pay \u00a3500 compensation to the local gay rights activist Gareth Lee, whose legal action was backed by the Equality Commission for Northern Ireland.</p> <p>Lee had tried to buy a cake depicting the Sesame Street characters Bert and Ernie below the motto \u2018Support gay marriage\u2019 for an event to mark International Day Against Homophobia in 2014. </p> <p>The Ashers case has received international attention, and highlighted the tensions between gay rights reformers and the politically influential and socially conservative born-again Christian lobby within Northern Ireland. </p> <p>The three appeal judges on Monday were Northern Ireland\u2019s lord chief justice, Sir Declan Morgan, and Lord Justices Weatherup and Weir.</p> <p>In delivering their judgment, Morgan rejected the argument of lawyers for Daniel McArthur and his family that the bakery would have been endorsing gay marriage equality by baking the cake.</p> <p>\u201cThe fact that a baker provides a cake for a particular team or portrays witches on a Halloween cake does not indicate any support for either,\u201d the lord chief justice said. </p> <p>Following the judgment, Daniel McArthur, flanked by his wife Amy, said: \u201cThis ruling undermines democratic freedom, religious freedom and freedom of speech.\u201d</p> <p>Supporters of the family firm, including former Democratic Unionist minister in the devolved government at Stormont Jim Wells, described the judgment as \u201can awful decision\u201d. Wells said an appeal would be mounted against the ruling at the supreme court in London.</p> <p>Morgan declared that the original judgment at Belfast recorders court had been correct in finding that, \u201cas a matter of law\u201d, Ashers had \u201cdiscriminated against the respondent directly on the grounds of sexual orientation contrary to the Equality Act (Sexual Orientation) Regulations 2006\u201d.</p> <p>He said the legislation on equality in the region could not be changed to suit one particular religious or political group.</p> <p>On Ashers\u2019 stance regarding the cake, Morgan said: \u201cThe supplier may provide the particular service to all or to none but not to a selection of customers based on prohibited grounds. In the present case the appellants might elect not to provide a service that involves any religious or political message. What they may not do is provide a service that only reflects their own political or religious message in relation to sexual orientation.\u201d</p> <p>The lord chief justice criticised the Equality Commission for Northern Ireland. He said the publicly funded body should also have offered the McArthur family advice during the case, as the bakers believed their rights as people of faith within the commercial sphere were being undermined.</p> <p>Lee was embraced and shook hands with supporters after the judges left the court, and made a brief statement outside court expressing his relief. \u201cThe only thing that I would like to say is I\u2019m relieved and very grateful to the court of appeal for the judgment,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Speaking before going into the appeal court on Monday morning, Daniel McArthur had said: \u201dThis has never been about the customer. It has been about a message promoting a cause that contradicts the Bible.\u201d</p> <p>Lee placed his order at the bakery shortly after the Democratic Unionist party used its power of veto in the Northern Ireland assembly to block moves to make gay marriage legal in the province. The region is the only part of the UK where same-sex marriage is still not recognised in law. </p> <p>The DUP has a strong base in the province\u2019s evangelical Christian community and was founded out of the late Dr Ian Paisley\u2019s Free Presbyterian church. The party has consistently blocked proposals in the assembly from other parties including their main partners in government, Sinn F\u00e9in, to legalise gay marriage. </p> <p>During a four-day hearing at the court of appeal in Belfast earlier this year, lawyers for the McArthur family said they challenged the finding because in their eyes it would have been sinful for them to complete the order.</p> <p>In their legal battle to overturn the ruling, the McArthur family won the support of Northern Ireland\u2019s attorney general, John Larkin QC.</p> <p>During the hearing in May, the attorney general argued in court that the McArthur family was entitled to constitutional protection for turning down a customer\u2019s order based on their personal religious beliefs.</p> <p>Following Monday\u2019s ruling one of the main gay rights organisations in Northern Ireland welcomed the judges\u2019 decision.</p> <p>John O\u2019Doherty, the director of the Rainbow Project, said: \u201cAshers Baking Company entered into a contractual agreement to make this cake and then changed their mind. Sympathetic as some may be to the position in which the company finds itself, this does not change the facts of the case. The judgment clearly articulated that this is direct discrimination for which there can be no justification.\u201d</p> <p>O\u2019Doherty added: \u201cWe once again extend the hand of friendship to all people of faith, churches and families. We would encourage faith leaders to engage with our community to ensure better relations and to develop trust and respect between our overlapping communities for the betterment of our society.\u201d</p> <p></p> <p></p>",
  "<p>After 52 years of war, the government finalised a <a href=\"https://www.mesadeconversaciones.com.co/sites/default/files/24_08_2016acuerdofinalfinalfinal-1472094587.pdf\">peace accord</a> to cease conflict and construct stable and long lasting peace in Colombia.

Numerous attacks to oil pipelines during the last 35 years have resulted in 4.1m spilled barrels, the equivalent to 16 disasters like <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/photo/2014/03/the-exxon-valdez-oil-spill-25-years-ago-today/100703/\">Exxon Valdez</a>.</p> <p>The end of the conflict brings opportunities to repair the environmental damage and rethink the country\u2019s development. There are many environmental reasons to be happy about the peace accord, not least the potential to decrease deforestation; have greater control over the restoration, recovery and conservation of ecological areas (such as natural parks and <em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P%C3%A1ramo\">paramos</a></em>); and to create a more sustainable, efficient and diverse economy.</p> <p>The impact of the war on Colombia\u2019s natural richness has been huge. Sections on \u201cintegral rural reform\u201d and the \u201csolution to the illegal drugs problem\u201d in the peace accord show that post-conflict policy will have an impact on economic, social and environmental development.

The fund will have 3m hectares of land during its first 10 years of creation. Some of these lands will come from the update, delimitation, and strengthening of the forest reserve and their granting will be conditional on the formulation (with the involvement of local communities) of plans to guarantee social and environmental sustainability. The accord also establishes that those who benefit from these lands will have to protect the environment, remove illicit crops and strengthen food production.</p> <p>The government has a deadline of no more than two years to develop an environmental zoning plan where it delimits the agricultural frontier and expands the inventory of areas that require special environmental management such as forest reserves, highly bio-diverse lands, fragile and strategic ecosystems, watersheds, <em>paramos</em> and wetlands.</p> <h2><strong>Conservation and deforestation</strong></h2> <p>Conservation and deforestation are some of the most complex environmental problems linked to conflict and peace. While the conflict has contributed to deforestation and the destruction of ecosystems, it has also limited the exploitation of resources such as wood, mining, and agribusiness in several rural and difficult to access areas, many of which are characterised by high biodiversity.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In other places around the world, post-conflict internal migration has led to increased pressure on natural resources</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In other places around the world, post-conflict internal migration has led to increased pressure on natural resources and in many cases, an increase in deforestation.</p> <p>In this sense, the accord establishes that the reform must guarantee socio-environmental sustainability. There is also an important focus on the protection of natural reserves.</p> <p>In addition, the section about economic and social reincorporation in the accord establishes that programmes for ex-combatants will pay special attention to environmental protection and recovery and humanitarian de-mining. In a similar fashion, the component regarding the conflict\u2019s victims explains that, as part of victims\u2019 reparation, the Farc is committed to participate in programmes to repair environmental damages like reforestation.</p> <h2><strong>Drugs</strong></h2> <p>One of the factors that contribute to deforestation and thus, to this sector being one of the largest carbon emitters is the production of illicit drugs like marijuana, cocaine and heroin. The accord creates voluntary crop substitution programmes to ensure that alternatives are sustainable from an environmental and economic point of view. Substitution plans must include actions for the mitigation of environmental damage in areas of special environmental interest and for forest recovery.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/jul/09/the-phrase-economic-development-has-bad-associations-in-latin-america\">The phrase 'economic development' has bad associations  in Latin America</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>New resources, new challenges</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/blog/2016/6/23/La-paz-oportunidad-para-el-medio-ambiente-en-Colombia.html\">According to the UN</a>, war has limited the economic development that Colombia can achieve thanks to its biodiversity. It is also true that the areas that face the most intense conflict are areas of great biodiversity like Choc\u00f3. At the same time, they face great economic need and state neglect. Peace opens an opportunity for these areas to exploit their natural resources in a way that does not enrich illegal groups nor corrupt politicians. This is the opportunity to take advantage of the land to create and implement sustainable tourism programmes and other forms of economic development that do not solely depend on resource extraction, but on their preservation and responsible use to offer a better quality of life to vulnerable and low-income communities.</p> <p>Much has been said about the economic dividends of peace. Colombia spends approximately <a href=\"http://datos.bancomundial.org/indicador/MS.MIL.XPND.GD.ZS?year_high_desc=truehttp://datos.bancomundial.org/indicador/MS.MIL.XPND.GD.ZS?year_high_desc=true\">3.4% of its gross domestic product</a> in defence. It is the Latin American country that spends the most on this sector. Although freeing this public budget does not directly mean that there will more economic growth or better social spending, it does open an opportunity to redirect this money to education, health, and environment. According to the government, peace can result in an <a href=\"http://thomsonreuters.com/en/articles/2015/reuters-newsmaker-interview-colombia-president-santos.html\">increase of 1.5%</a> in GDP and 5% to 8% in the regions most affected by conflict.</p> <p>Some of these issues are being contested under the renegotiation process following the vote, particularly the rural reform. If the government and the guerrilla can agree to go ahead with an accord that includes the elements of the original agreement discussed above, it is possible to reinvent the environmental governance of the country. The great challenge then from now on will be how to manage resources in a responsible and proactive fashion. In order to advance towards sustainable development, strengthening of institutional capacity, monitoring, transparency in implementation, and accountability should all be central components in a post-conflict scenario.</p> <p><em>The piece was originally published on <a href=\"http://www.nivela.org/articles/la-paz-en-colombia-una-oportunidad-clave-para-un-desarrollo-sostenible/en\">Nivela</a>. </em></p> <p><em>Camila Bustos is a lead researcher and </em><em>Marcela Jaramillo is a policy adviser on climate finance at Nivela.

  "<p>I\u2019ve always had a nagging feeling that there must be a better way to do things and that we could do more for patients. It started almost immediately as I began my career as a student paramedic. I tried to suppress it; it wasn\u2019t really the done thing. Everyone talked about what was wrong with the way things were but no one talked about how we could make them better.<br></p> <p>At first it was easy; my mind was awash with all the new experiences of daily ambulance life, busy learning how to fit in, to be a paramedic \u2013 doing the things paramedics did. And I loved it, flying through the streets of London with blue lights flashing, responding to calls and patients. </p> <p>However, as I rolled through my days, that nagging feeling began to return, and now it seemed harder to ignore. It was hard to explain to those around me and at times it felt like we were speaking different languages. People talked about how we could \u201cnever be wrong for taking someone to hospital\u201d and \u201cwhat did we know?\u201d. Even my colleagues, who agreed that at times it didn\u2019t feel right, would feel powerless \u2013 crippled by a fear and belief that making a mistake would cost them their job. Managers felt just as powerless as the rest of us and were under pressure to keep response times down. The pressure they were under was tangible and communications between frontline staff and managers seemed to hit a brick wall. I grew frustrated and tired; at times it felt claustrophobic, surely if we keep doing what we\u2019d always done then nothing would ever change? </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/healthcare-network/2016/mar/03/my-life-as-a-paramedic-when-every-second-counts\">My life as a paramedic: when every second counts</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The real breakthrough came when I was invited to take part in a collaborative project on frailty. We explored ways in which we could work differently to improve the patient care for the people we had so often responded to by ambulance, setting up a falls response service with community nurses. We shared our skills and experiences to meet the needs of the patients that we would have previously taken to hospital and helped them in their own homes instead. </p> <p>The lead for the project was a Darzi fellow, a GP who had taken a year out of her training to develop herself and her leadership skills. The fellowship is an initiative that benefits both participants and their employing organisations. Over the past seven years, Darzi fellows have led major service improvements, implemented numerous safety and quality initiatives, and made substantial financial savings for trusts. I applied for clinically relevant posts advertised on the NHS jobs website and was invited to interview with a number of trusts across London. I am spending the year working on a project helping people manage their chronic joint pain. </p> <p>Unlike my job as a paramedic the pressure here is different, less immediate, and less obvious but still very much there. It lurks in the background \u2013 no one here will die or lose a limb as a result of a mistake I make, but what I do here could play a part in what is the practice of the future. It\u2019s hard to see if what I do will make a difference and often I won\u2019t know for months or even years to come. </p> <p>I find myself stuck between two worlds and constantly explaining what it is I do. I feel I am no longer considered a clinician by my former colleagues and yet I don\u2019t consider myself to be a manager. My former colleagues joke about my office hours and weekends off but equally I am overwhelmed by the words of support and encouragement I have received from them \u2013 they enthusiastically ask about my work and are proud of what I, \u201cthe paramedic\u201d, have achieved.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/healthcare-network/views-from-the-nhs-frontline/2015/jan/12/a-and-e-patients-dont-need-ambulance\">Paramedic: most patients we take into A&amp;E don\u2019t need to be there</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Despite bridging these two worlds, I feel that I have the best of each \u2013 my insight into the clinical frontline as a paramedic and the constant challenge of being a Darzi fellow involved in quality improvement work.

  "<p>There were no tears from Manuel Locatelli this time around. The 18-year-old midfielder had wept live on TV at the start of this month, overcome by emotion after scoring a brilliant first senior goal <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/oct/03/manuel-locatelli-milan-future-seriea\">to help Milan beat Sassuolo</a>. On Saturday night, after serving up an even better strike to seal a 1-0 victory over Juventus at San Siro, he simply smiled, before embarking on an Oscars-worthy acceptance speech. </p> <p>Locatelli thanked his parents, his cousins, his manager, and his friends \u2013 even the two who support the <em>Bianconeri</em>. He dedicated a thought to Riccardo Montolivo, whom he has replaced in the starting XI after the club captain tore a cruciate ligament on international duty. He gave the credit for this goal to Silvio Berlusconi, saying that the outgoing owner has been one of his biggest supporters from the start. </p> <p>Just about the only person whose contribution Locatelli did not acknowledge, was himself. \u201cI don\u2019t know how to explain what I did, really,\u201d he mumbled. \u201cThere was a bit of luck and I need to keep my feet on the floor.\u201d </p> <p>Or, better yet, use them to keep on shooting. His finish from the right-hand corner of the penalty box against Juventus was extraordinary, crashing so violently into the underside of the crossbar that you thought it might still have enough momentum to burst through the side netting afterwards. This was Locatelli\u2019s second shot on target, ever, in Serie A, and also his second goal.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/oct/21/herbert-kilpin-milan-nottingham\">Herbert Kilpin, the Lord of Milan, gains recognition his pioneering deserves | Richard Williams</a> </p> </aside>  <p>On the touchline, Vincenzo Montella shook his head, bewildered. The Milan manager scored more than 200 times in his professional career, but even he cannot have hit many better. \u201cHe\u2019s a <em>predestinato</em>, [a person pre-destined for great things],\u201d said Montella of his midfielder afterwards. \u201cHe did give away a couple of balls coming out of defence, though, and Juve didn\u2019t punish us. Let\u2019s leave him to grow.\u201d</p> <p>Locatelli did indeed make mistakes early in this game, and on another day the story might have unfolded very differently. Juventus had a perfectly good goal disallowed at 0-0, the referee Nicola Rizzoli initially signalling that Miralem Pjanic\u2019s strike should stand before changing his mind after a lengthy conference with the linesman Gianluca Cariolato. </p> <p>The sideline official believed, wrongly, that Leonardo Bonucci had been in an offside position as he attacked his team-mate\u2019s free-kick at the far post. Cariolato kept his flag down because the defender made no contact with the ball, which snuck past Gianluigi Donnarumma all the same. Instead, he buzzed Rizzoli to inform him of what he thought he had seen. It was left to the referee to decide whether or not Bonucci had interfered with play, and on this point few would disagree \u2013 the Milan goalkeeper was plainly distracted by his opponent\u2019s presence.</p> <p>If Juventus should fail to win the <em>Scudetto</em> this season, then this incident might one day be remembered in a similar light to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2012/feb/27/milan-ghost-goal-juventus-serie-a\">Sulley Muntari\u2019s \u2018ghost goal\u2019 for Milan in the corresponding fixture back in 2012</a>. For now, though, it is still premature to call the <em>Rossoneri</em> title contenders.</p> <p>Their neighbours, Inter, were hailed as such after beating Juventus at San Siro last month, but now sit 14th in the table. No wonder Montella was so anxious to keep his own players grounded. Milan are up to third, only two points behind the league leaders, but this season is still very young.</p> <p>So, too, is Milan\u2019s starting XI. With an average age of 25 years and 260 days, it is the youngest in Serie A by some distance. Not that you would think it to look at some of the players involved.</p> <p>Gigi Buffon\u2019s own father confessed last week to being struck by the presence of Donnarumma in the Milan goal, saying: \u201cIt seems impossible to me that he could be the same age as Gigi was when he started out \u2013 he seems so much bigger. My son, at 17, still seemed like a boy.\u201d</p> <p>Donnarumma played his part in protecting Milan\u2019s lead on Saturday, stretching out that 6ft 5in frame of his to tip away a Sami Khedira shot in injury time. Just as decisive was his forward plunge to push away a Juan Cuadrado cross on the edge of the six-yard box as both Pjanic and Mario Mandzukic steamed in behind. </p> <p>Already, the goalkeeper has progressed from callow teen into a man capable of inspiring religious fervour. Adriano Galliani, irrepressible as ever on what might be one of his last big nights as the club\u2019s CEO (his future under <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/20/gianluigi-buffon-chinese-investment-milan-internazionale-defeat\">the incoming Chinese owners</a> is unclear), spoke on Saturday with the tone of a true believer.</p> <p>\u201cI went to hug Gigio after the match,\u201d said Galliani. \u201cI didn\u2019t know he was bleeding from one ear and I stained my jacket. Let\u2019s not get blasphemous here, but Gigio\u2019s blood is a big deal.\u201d</p> <p>If Locatelli and Donnarumma made the most eye-catching contributions to this victory, then there are plenty more Milan players whose contribution deserves to be recognised. Alessio Romagnoli, the 21-year-old centre-half, had not committed a foul all season before getting penalised this weekend for a kick on Bonucci. M\u2019Baye Niang, has been a key contributor in attack all season, but contributed tirelessly to aid the defensive effort against Juventus. </p> <p>Sinisa Mihajlovic deserves his share of the credit for the work he did developing these same players while serving as the club\u2019s manager last season. Were it not for the February car accident in which Niang injured his ankle, it is quite possible that the campaign would have ended very differently.</p> <p>Montella, though, has brought with him an optimism that this club had long been lacking. The atmosphere at Milanello is lighter, a spirit the manager has fostered by breaking up his training sessions with spontaneous diversions like games of touch rugby.</p> <p>Crucially, he has also succeeded in shielding his squad from a tumultuous few months at board level \u2013 as the slow process of the takeover created confusion among directors and stasis in the transfer market. Giacomo Bonaventura, another player who has been central to the team\u2019s success this season, confessed in an interview with Gazzetta dello Sport last week that he had thought about leaving in the summer, before he saw his new manager at work.</p> <p>\u201cI was expecting to find more chaos, but Montella was very clever in isolating us from that,\u201d said the midfielder. \u201cI thought he would show up and turn everything on its head, but instead he took it one step at a time and the thing that helped was keeping a calm atmosphere.\u201d</p> <p>Preserving such a cool-headed climate will only get harder as this team soars higher. But if Locatelli\u2019s clear eyes are a guide, Milan are adjusting quickly to their newfound success.</p> <h2>Talking points</h2> <p>\u2022 Before Milan\u2019s win on Saturday came a hugely entertaining <em>Derby della Lanterna</em>. Sampdoria\u2019s 2-1 win over Genoa had just about everything: an own goal, a missed penalty, both teams hitting the woodwork and a bizarre first-half stoppage caused by a goalline-technology malfunction. Mat\u00edas Silvestre\u2019s header had come down off the bar and landed a yard short of the line, yet several officials felt their watches vibrate \u2013 indicating that a goal had been scored. Happily, after a pause, they decided to go with what their eyes told them.</p> <p>\u2022 As with any good derby, there were plenty of subplots at the Marassi, but perhaps the most charming was the one that saw Christian Puggioni make his first start in goal for Sampdoria at 35 years old. A lifelong fan of the <em>Blucerchiati</em>, he was frozen out at his former club, Chievo, after refusing to sign for Genoa on the grounds of rivalry alone. Instead, he would eventually join Samp in 2015, becoming their third-choice keeper behind Emiliano Viviano and Alberto Brignoli. Nobody really expected that he\u2019d ever play a game. But this summer Brignoli, who had been on loan from Juventus, moved on to Legan\u00e1s. And then, Viviano injured his wrist. Suddenly Puggioni found himself thrust into the starting lineup for the derby. And better yet, winning it, after making several important saves.</p> <p>\u2022 That win over Southampton in midweek did nothing to change the overall trajectory of Inter\u2019s season, which only seems to drift further into disarray. Not even a brilliant strike from \u00c9der could rescue them from a 2-1 defeat by Atalanta, and Monday\u2019s papers carried claims that Frank De Boer could be sacked any day now. My suspicion is that such reports are premature, but it must be said that the Dutchman is showing few signs at present of getting a handle on his team\u2019s malaise.</p> <p>\u2022 Napoli did get a win to end their own run of three consecutive defeats \u2013 though it was only over Crotone, who continue to look hopelessly out of their depth. Any positives were further undermined for Maurizio Sarri\u2019s team by a needless red card for Manolo Gabbiadini \u2013 the only healthy centre-forward in the first-team squad.</p> <p>\u2022 Edin Dzeko extended his lead atop the Serie A scoring charts, notching his eighth league goal of the season during Roma\u2019s 4-1 rout of Palermo. That is already as many as he scored in all of 2015-16.</p> <p>\u2022 Cagliari and Fiorentina combined to match Dzeko\u2019s tally in a single afternoon, the <em>Viola</em> winning 5-3 in Sardinia. They had previously scored six goals all season. The optimistic take would be to suggest that this could be a breakout occasion for the hitherto intermittent talent of Federico Bernardeschi, who scored twice and set up one of Nikola Kalinic\u2019s three goals. A more realistic one might be to acknowledge that Cagliari invite these sort of scorelines with their admirably gung-ho style.</p> <p><strong>Results:</strong> Atalanta 2-1 Inter, Bologna 1-1 Sassuolo, Crotone 1-2 Napoli, Empoli 0-0 Chievo, Milan 1-0 Juventus, Roma 4-1 Palermo, Sampdoria 2-1 Genoa, Torino 2-2 Lazio, Udinese 3-1 Pescara</p>  <figure class=\"element element-table\"

  "<p>Craig Baxam was lost. He thought he was in a town in northern Kenya called Marareme, though really he didn\u2019t have a clue. He then got on a bus headed to Garissa, towards the Somali border, but was puzzled by the way the other passengers referred to it as \u201cArara\u201d.<br></p> <p>Baxam was far from home, spoke no local language and knew little about the region he was traveling through. If he were successful in reaching southern Somalia, his destination, things would almost certainly get worse for him: the war-torn country, where he planned to live according to his faith, remains one of the most inhospitable and perilous on Earth. </p> <p>Yet none of that flustered him. All he wanted was to keep on moving towards the border. Find it, cross it and begin a new, better, devout life.</p> <p>Baxam, 24 at the time, had thrown to the winds his comfortable existence in Laurel, Maryland, where he worked for a TV services company. In December 2011 he cashed in his thrift savings plan account (all $3,613.38 of it), gave $1,000 of that to an acquaintance in need, and with the rest bought himself a ticket to Nairobi. He had decided to set out on a hijrah, a migration to a true Islamic land, as he was instructed to do in the Qu\u2019ran.</p> <p>To say that this was all new to Baxam would be an understatement. A black American raised Catholic who had recently discharged himself from the US army after four years of service, he grew up with no connection to the Muslim faith. But five months before his trip, he went through a dramatic and sudden conversion after stumbling on a religious website. </p> <p>Barely half a year later, he was making his way north through Kenya into the vast unknown.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/aug/18/somalia-terrorist-carpenter-al-shabaab\">Somalia: one man\u2019s terrorist is another man\u2019s carpenter</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As he travelled, Baxam kept his head down, stopping merely to eat and pray at mosques. He had good reason to be careful: he was heading towards one of the world\u2019s most anarchic conflict zones in a country that had been in the throes of an extreme <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/jan/04/somalia-al-shabaab-insurgency-mogadishu-mohamed-nur\">Islamist insurgency</a> for several years. </p> <p>Once inside Somalia, he planned to live under al-Shabaab \u2013 a group designated by Washington as a terrorist organisation which practices a very strict form of Islam under the religious law of sharia. </p> <p>The stakes were high. US and Kenyan authorities worked closely together to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/jul/15/foreign-troops-in-somalia-struggle-to-keep-al-shabaab-at-bay\">intercept</a> any movement across the border from al-Shabaab members, and Baxam had a taste of those security efforts as he sat on the bus going north. He later told the FBI there were posters all along the route telling people to contact police should they see anyone acting strangely. He must have looked suspicious himself, he said, given what was about to happen.<br></p> <p>Soon after the bus pulled out, a man boarded and gently began asking Baxam questions. Where was he going? Did he speak the local dialect? Was there family nearby? </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"2a53d4e9e91c84f261770d6e2f099caf0526a578\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2a53d4e9e91c84f261770d6e2f099caf0526a578/0_0_2021_2441/828.jpg\" alt=\"Craig Baxam with his mother Deanna in November 2015.\" width=\"828\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Craig Baxam with his mother Deanna in November 2015.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Deanna Baxam</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Baxam thought to himself: I\u2019m in luck, here\u2019s someone who wants to help me. It didn\u2019t quite turn out like that. Not long after, the bus was surrounded by Kenyan police who swarmed onboard and took him away on suspicion of terrorism. </p> <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> <p>At 7am on a Monday, 11 days after Craig Baxam was hauled off the bus, the phone rang at Deanna Baxam\u2019s house in Atlanta, more than 8,000 miles away. It was the Baltimore field office of the FBI. Her son, she was told, had been detained in Kenya and was in a Nairobi jail. </p> <p>That was all they said. Nothing about how long he\u2019d been held, where he\u2019d been, or what treatment he had endured.</p> <p>The following day, 4 January 2012, two FBI agents from the Atlanta division came knocking on Deanna Baxam\u2019s door. They asked whether she was willing to pay for her son\u2019s plane ticket home. When she inquired whether he had been charged with any crime, they said no, so she readily agreed, thinking Craig would soon be back with her.</p> <p>\u201cThey said: \u2018We would like to bring him home to you, but you have to pay the airfare.\u2019 So I gave them my charge card and they put a $3,000 ticket on it,\u201d Baxam said in the course of a three-hour interview with the Guardian in her home in the Atlanta suburbs.</p> <p>On 6 January 2012, she began the long drive to Maryland to meet her son as he flew into Baltimore Washington international airport. She was apprehensive, but happy he was safe and coming home. But somewhere on the interstate, another call came in from the FBI. Craig\u2019s plane had already landed, they told her. He had been re-arrested as he set foot on US soil and taken off to a federal institution. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/us-membership/power.html\" data-alt=\"membership callout\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/us-membership/power.html\">membership callout</a> </figure>  <p>He was <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3148000-Indictment-1.html\">charged</a> with attempting to provide material support to al-Shabaab, the designated terrorist organisation, and informed that he faced a maximum prison sentence of 15 years. </p> <p>Of all the many things that have happened to Deanna Baxam since that day, having the FBI asking her to pay for her son\u2019s plane ticket so he could be flown into the waiting claws of the US justice system perhaps hurts the most.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m very angry about that. They used me as an American citizen, had me spend private funds to conduct law enforcement activities on behalf of the FBI. That\u2019s not the worst of it. The worst of it is this: my government screwed my son and made me pay for it.\u201d</p> <p>She may not have realized it fully at that time, but Deanna Baxam had just been sucked into one of the defining conflicts of the modern age: religious fundamentalism versus the US national security apparatus. </p> <p>On the one hand, she now had a son who professed to be a devout Muslim and who felt such a fierce commitment to his newly discovered faith that he was prepared to leave his family and radically change his life to practice it. On the other hand, she also had to deal with seemingly duplicitous anti-terrorist agents within the FBI who were bearing down on her child with the full might of the world\u2019s only superpower. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>As a mother, it bothers me that I lent my son to the army and they didn\u2019t give him back to me</p> <footer> <cite>Deanna Baxam</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>She was caught between two utterly bewildering worlds, and her initial reaction was one of disbelief. This didn\u2019t happen to a family like hers. \u201cI thought our family did everything right, everything that would keep us out of the government\u2019s clutches,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Deanna was born in Nebraska, a US citizen, but she was raised in Jamaica to Jamaican parents. She returned to the US after completing her chemistry degree and went on to marry Carl Baxam, an American Trinidadian who worked for a defense contractor. They had two sons, the youngest of whom, Craig, was born in 1987.</p> <p>There was always something special about Craig, she said. He was creative, outgoing, smart. He also had an obsessional quality, as smart kids often do. Passions would flare up, burn brightly and then fizzle out in quick succession. \u201cOne day when he was about 10, he wanted to learn Hangul, so he visited our Korean neighbors every day \u2013 he was a real pest. That was typical: he wanted to learn the piano so he would go at it for days and days, and then it was done.\u201d</p> <p>Along with that intensity came what she describes as a purist streak. \u201cThere was no grey for him: it was either black or white, right or wrong. Nothing in between. When things were shoved into the in-between, he couldn\u2019t deal with it.\u201d</p> <p>There were other difficulties. He once said to his mother he thought he had attention deficit disorder, though she couldn\u2019t see it. He also took the divorce of his parents badly. They separated when Craig was eight years old and a few years after that Deanna moved away from Maryland to New Jersey, leaving her son largely in the care of his father. </p> <p>The internal struggle reflected itself in Craig\u2019s education. He flunked out of college before the end of freshman year, and then flunked out of community college. Deanna kept asking him what he was going to do with his life, a question which he answered, to her shock and dismay, by signing up for the US military. He enlisted in 2007, telling Deanna that he wanted to defend America in the wake of 9/11. After eight months\u2019 training in advanced cryptology and intelligence, he was posted to Baghdad. </p> <p>Until he joined the army, Craig had been what his mother describes as \u201cvery clean. Didn\u2019t drink or do drugs. Never. He had never been in trouble of any kind and had no criminal convictions or arrest record.\u201d She doesn\u2019t know what happened to him in Iraq \u2013 to this day he refuses to talk about it \u2013 but she does know that he came back a changed person.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"56374f1fbe391511c34791372ea698983fcfe27e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/56374f1fbe391511c34791372ea698983fcfe27e/0_346_1372_1945/705.jpg\" alt=\"Craig Baxam at Goodfellow Air Force Base in San Angelo, Texas, in 2007.\" width=\"705\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Craig Baxam at Goodfellow air force base in San Angelo, Texas, in 2007.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Deanna Baxam</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cAs a mother, it bothers me that I lent my son to the army and they didn\u2019t give him back to me. I still don\u2019t have him back. I raised nice, middle-class children, sent them to music lessons, Catholic school, and then he just came back different.\u201d </p> <p>Having never smoked, Craig now consumed cigarettes, marijuana and K2 (synthetic marijuana, which at the time of his arrest was a legal substance). He began drinking heavily, another first.</p> <p>Deanna Baxam is convinced her son displayed classic PTSD symptoms. In between flashes of anger, he was withdrawn and disconnected. She had made his bedroom welcoming for his homecoming, but instead of sleeping in the new bed she\u2019d bought for him, he insisted on lying on the floor with his head on his service bag, as though he were still in the war zone.</p> <p>He signed up for one more tour of duty, this time to South Korea. The night before he was dispatched, she recalls that Craig would not move from a chair in the kitchen. \u201cI went to bed, and I left him sitting there in the chair in the dark all night. That wasn\u2019t right. There was something bad going on.\u201d</p> <p>Amid all this turbulence, Craig Baxam turned to the Muslim faith that was to become his salvation and his undoing. </p> <p>While stationed in South Korea, he began exploring religions. He would send his mother emails asking existential questions such as \u201cdo you believe there\u2019s only one God?\u201d or comparing Christianity with Islam. She was impressed and glad he was nurturing his spiritual side.</p> <p>But when he got off the plane on his return in July 2011, she knew something major had happened. He had grown a beard and was wearing a kufi and robe. She was stunned, and let it show. \u201cOh my God, what happened to you? Why would you even travel looking like that?\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cMom, I\u2019m a Muslim now,\u201d he replied.</p> <p>She ran out of the airport, sat on a bench and cried.</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t the faith that distressed her: they had raised their children to be believers, and Deanna Baxam herself is a Pentecostal Christian. It was the feeling of abandonment.</p> <p>\u201cFaith is important to me,\u201d she said. \u201cBut we raised them in a certain tradition, so to have him leave Christianity was like a rejection of the family. I was angry about it for a long time. I told him, \u2018I\u2019m as devout as you are, but we are on different tracks and you are separating our family.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>According to an <a href=\"http://www.investigativeproject.org/documents/case_docs/1874.pdf\">affidavit</a> given by an FBI agent, Craig Baxman converted about a week to 10 days before he quit the army in South Korea. There seems to have been no grooming involved by any individual or organization: Baxam had been surfing the internet and had come across a website that talked about the Day of Judgment \u2013 it spoke to him and made him hungry for more. Almost instantly he was praying five times a day and devouring books on Islam.</p> <p>Back in the US, he regularly tried to convert his own mother, too.

Since Craig Baxam\u2019s attempt to live under its control, the extremists have carried out some of the most brutal terrorist attacks in living memory, including the 2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/24/kenya-mall-hostage-westgate-nairobi\">Westgate mall attack</a> in Nairobi in which at least 67 people were killed.<br></p> <p>The group emerged in about 2006 out of the anarchy and chaos that has gripped Somalia, a \u201cfailed state\u201d. At the time that Baxam was making his way through Kenya, carrying only a few hundred dollars in his pocket, a prayer mat and a copy of the Qu\u2019ran, al-Shabaab militants<strong> </strong>were being forced out of the Somali capital Mogadishu but were still in control of large swathes of the south of the country.</p> <p>It was these al-Shabaab-controlled areas of Somalia that Craig Baxam was determined to reach. Using the internet, he had identified three places in the world where, in his view, a Muslim could conform fully to the tenets of his new religion under sharia law. <br></p> <p>The trio of locations that he chose as his possible future havens are among the harshest environments \u2013 both physically and spiritually \u2013 on the globe. They were the Taliban-controlled parts of Afghanistan; the southern islands of the Philippines, where an extremist group was trying to gain a foothold on Mindanao; and the al-Shabaab parts of Somalia.</p> <p>US prosecutors presented in court documents a psychological profile of Baxam in which they alleged that he had been aware of al-Shabaab\u2019s terrorist designation and the insurgency it was actively fighting at the time within Somalia. Based on interrogations with him while he was held captive by Kenyan police with FBI agents in attendance, they claimed that he had become hostile towards America, which he regarded as oppressive to Muslims.</p> <p>\u201cTo live as a Muslim in the US you need to compromise,\u201d the FBI agent\u2019s affidavit said, paraphrasing Craig Baxam\u2019s alleged position. \u201cHe finds the constant playing of music and display of pictures disrespectful. Only Allah can create images.\u201d</p> <p>The affidavit went on to allege that Baxam was prepared to take up arms and fight against the US if it attacked al-Shabaab:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Baxam saw himself dying in Somalia. It might be from malaria or from being hit by a rocket. Only Allah could know. Baxam never intended to return from Somalia, he was \u2018looking for dying with a gun in my hand\u2019. He would be happy to die defending Islam; being mowed down or hit with a cruise missile. If someone dies defending Islam, they are guaranteed a place in Jannah [paradise].</p> </blockquote> <p>It\u2019s impossible to really know what was going through Craig Baxam\u2019s head as he was making his fateful journey. In a recent letter to the Guardian from his current prison cell in Beaumont, Texas, he declined to be interviewed, writing that \u201cdespite the grief the US government has caused me, I am a private man and I also consider what happened to me to be far more insignificant than other cases\u201d.</p> <p>But there are clues that suggest that the US prosecutors\u2019 account of his intentions was overblown. The federal judge assigned to the case, Frederick Motz, <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3147999-OrderReBillofParticulars.html\">cast doubt</a> on the state\u2019s claim that Baxam had terrorist inclinations. </p> <p>\u201cAccording to what he told FBI agents,\u201d Motz wrote in a court memo, \u201cit appears to me that defendant had not formed an intention to fight for al-Shabaab in any offensive capacity when he travelled to Somalia. To the contrary, all the statements seem to reveal is that defendant wanted to live in a Muslim country under Sharia law and that if the country in which he was residing was attacked, he would then defend that country.\u201d </p> <p>For Deanna Baxam, the account given by the state \u2013 that her son was a callous terrorist-sympathiser intent on betraying his own country \u2013 just didn\u2019t ring true. As she sees it, it was his innate purist streak that was leading him on, not any political sensibility. \u201cHe believed that the Qu\u2019ran says that if you live in an oppressive regime where Islam is not in control, like America, then you should make hijrah. So he set off for Somalia.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"97833dfc1ef4021f05b05cb6517acf939ab0afba\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/97833dfc1ef4021f05b05cb6517acf939ab0afba/0_0_1260_1666/756.jpg\" alt=\"A letter from Baxam to his mother.\" width=\"756\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A letter from Baxam to his mother.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Deanna Baxam</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A mother is not the most dispassionate witness. But Deanna Baxam also has a lawyer\u2019s eye, having retrained in law several years ago. She has identified aspects of the case that make her deeply uneasy about the justice served. There were the 11 days between her son\u2019s arrest on the bus in northern Kenya, and his return to US soil \u2013 what happened in that period, how many times was he interrogated, and what role did the FBI play in the process? Why were none of the interrogations recorded on tape so that the FBI\u2019s account of what her son told them could be verified?<br></p> <p>She is alarmed by the fact that her own government deployed its considerable resources to track and detain her child on foreign soil. Instead of providing him with the care he needed as a disturbed veteran who had seen tours of duty in Iraq and South Korea and displayed symptoms of PTSD, they left him to his own devices.</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know any of this stuff happened,\u201d she said. \u201cThey track US nationals in Kenya? To say I\u2019m outraged doesn\u2019t seem enough of a response. When you are a US national overseas I thought the job of the government was to help protect you, not to collaborate with the Kenyan authorities in tracking you down.\u201d</p> <p>She is also dismayed by what she believes was the willful denial of her son\u2019s first amendment right to practice his religion. \u201cAmerica has a history of interning the Japanese, of persecuting people because of their religious beliefs. How is that different here? How can we imprison somebody who has no demonstrated guilty intent or action \u2013 there was none of that? And yet he is rounded up and sent to prison.\u201d</p> <p>Craig Baxam was sentenced in January 2014 to seven years in prison, with five years of post-prison supervision added on. The sentence flowed from a <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3147998-Plea-Agreement-Baxam-Copy.html\">plea bargain</a> in which the US government agreed to drop the main terrorist charges against him in return for a guilty plea to a lesser charge: that he had knowingly disposed of records that could be used in a terrorism investigation. Before leaving for Kenya, he had destroyed his personal computer and thrown it in a dumpster, allegedly to foil any future FBI probe.</p> <p>Today, Craig Baxam, now 29, is approaching his fifth anniversary behind bars, some of which time he has spent in solitary confinement. </p> <p>His father, Carl Baxam, lost his job with the defense contractor after 24 years of loyal service once news of the case broke. Carl died last year while Craig was still in prison.</p> <p>Deanna Baxam had to change the church in which she worshipped because she felt stigmatized by others in the congregation. She lost a few corporate contracts as a lawyer, as well as some professional friendships, after people dropped out of sight without saying a word. </p> <p>She says she still wrestles with the fallout of it all. She travels to visit her son whenever she can, and they exchange letters regularly. In his correspondence and phone calls, Craig continues to talk about Islam fervently, and makes clear that his long-term goal remains to live under sharia law, though no longer in Somalia. </p> <p>He signs his letters \u201cEsmail the American\u201d. In them, he\u2019ll weave in and out of a discussion of his faith. Allah will appear in one sentence, a joke about his mother\u2019s basketball team the Chicago Bulls the next. From time to time, he\u2019ll make another stab at getting Deanna to convert to Islam. </p> <p>As a mother, she has had to accept that there\u2019s a side to her son that is now beyond her reach. \u201cThere is a part of me that says, \u2018How could this have happened, what would make you so driven that you would want to go and live with al-Shabaab?\u2019 I can\u2019t understand that.\u201d</p> <p>She has tried to reach out to other mothers in her position, so far without success. \u201cPeople want to stay underground,\u201d she said. \u201cI mean, who wants to be known as the \u2018mother of a terrorist\u2019?\u201d</p> <p>If she had the chance to send a message to other mothers like her, trapped between religious fundamentalism and an overweaning government, what would she say? </p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d say: \u2018You are not alone. What has happened to you is beyond your imagination. But you are not alone.\u2019\u201d</p> <ul> <li>This article was amended on 25 October 2016 to correct the spelling of Craig Baxam\u2019s father\u2019s surname.</li> </ul> <ul> <li><em>No billionaire owner, no shareholders.

A goal from Stanley Ohawuchi after 64 minutes gave Zamalek a 1-0 win in front of 70,000 at the Borg El Arab Stadium but it was not enough to overturn a 3-0 deficit from last Saturday\u2019s first leg.</p> <p>After the game, Mansour was quick to blame supernatural forces for his team\u2019s defeat. \u201cIs it natural to waste 18 chances in front of goal? Things were obviously not normal and there was magic and sorcery involved,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Zamalek\u2019s chairman did emphasise the players\u2019 outstanding performance, stating: \u201cAll of the players and their coach were men today and we missed God\u2019s reconcile.

Yet Sundowns offered a stout defensive performance and threatened a few times on the counter-attack as they reached the break at 0-0.</p> <p>Nigerian Ohawuchi\u2019s shot from outside the penalty area in the 62nd minute handed the Egyptians some hope and they took complete control of the last half-hour, launching wave after wave of attack.</p> <p>Soumahoro Bangaly cleared off the line from Zamalek substitute Emmanuel Mayuka, the former Southampton striker, in the last 10 minutes and there were other narrow escapes for Sundowns.</p> <p>The new champions will now play in December\u2019s Club World Cup in Japan.</p>",
  "<p>Since its release in 2009, the online battle game League of Legends (LoL) has amassed a community of more than 100 million players and established itself as one of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/gallery/2016/aug/15/this-was-it-for-us-the-league-of-legends-oceanic-pro-league-grand-final-in-pictures\">top titles in competitive eSports</a>. But the game\u2019s most recent development takes a decidedly low-tech turn: an official board game called <a href=\"http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/featured/mechs-vs-minions\">Mechs vs Minions</a> developed by the design team at publisher Riot Games. </p> <p>The first thing that strikes you about the game is its sheer size. It weighs 5kg, and it arrived at my door in a box about as big as my 26in TV. Open it up, and the reason for its bulk becomes clear. Mechs vs Minions comes packed with components \u2013 modular map tiles, decks of cards, gorgeously crafted metal tokens and a collection of more than 100 plastic miniatures, all beautifully sculpted in LoL\u2019s distinctive cartoon style.</p> <p>If you\u2019ve played League of Legends, you\u2019ll find plenty that\u2019s familiar in this tabletop adaptation. Its storyline plays out in Runeterra, the video game\u2019s fictional setting. It relies heavily on co-operation between players, with teammates working together using a diverse set of character abilities. And just like its digital predecessor, it features tides of rampaging minions: diminutive enemies who make up for their lack of strength with overwhelming numbers.</p> <p>Mechanically, though, Mechs vs Minions is its own beast. It\u2019s a co-operative game, with players working together to confront a host of foes controlled by the game. You take command of characters mounted on powerful but erratic war-walkers. During each round you issue commands to your mech by drafting cards, each of which lets you perform a different action - moving, turning or attacking enemies. Over time you\u2019ll use these to create a kind of program for your character, adding new cards to your line-up and chopping and changing the ones already in place to adapt to the shifting state of the game.</p> <p>Getting this right requires a chess-like ability to think several moves ahead, and you need to coordinate actions between players to have any chance of completing missions. To complicate matters, the whole process comes with a strict time limit. You have about 40 seconds at the start of each round to spot threats and pick the right cards to deal with them, all dictated by an unforgiving sand timer.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f8dd6b26fd54772a6e24d6b32bda5316d035ae61\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f8dd6b26fd54772a6e24d6b32bda5316d035ae61/0_64_1920_1152/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mechs vs Minions board game\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mechs vs Minions features multiple missions, each with different challenges.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Owen Duffy/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This kind of pressure is at the heart of Mechs vs Minions. It challenges players to make increasingly complex decisions under rising levels of stress. And if that\u2019s not challenging enough, the game injects a huge element of chaos into proceedings. Enemies spawn on random locations. Minions move in unpredictable ways. Even the control of your own character can be taken out of your hands by damage cards which overwrite your commands and alter the behaviour of your mech. You can carefully craft an efficient and deadly set of actions, only to find yourself ineffectually breakdancing between tiles in an empty corner of the map.</p> <p>Whether this is a source of fun or frustration is likely to depend on your own preferences as a gamer, and it makes the game less about grand strategy than scrambling to react to events as they happen. This might reduce its appeal to more tactically minded players, but it can\u2019t really be considered a mis-step. A more valid criticism is that the design of some missions makes them much harder to complete when playing with fewer than the maximum count of four players. There\u2019s also some ambiguous language in the rulebook, and at times our group wasn\u2019t sure we were playing scenarios exactly as the designers intended.<br></p> <p>In other respects, though, Mechs vs Minions is an absolute triumph. Its production quality sets a new standard for the tabletop gaming industry, making even the biggest, shiniest releases from competitors look a little bit cheap by comparison. At a time when big-box board games are creeping towards the \u00a3100 mark, it\u2019s mind-boggling to see so much cardboard and plastic crammed into a \u20ac75 box.</p> <p>It also benefits from an expertly engineered learning curve. Its introductory scenario teaches the basic concepts, and the first few missions steadily introduce more advanced rules. The result is that you learn the game by playing it rather than by attempting to absorb a massive instruction book, allowing for an impressive degree of complexity, with boss battles, environmental hazards and new tactical options emerging throughout the campaign.</p> <p>It\u2019s part of a constant sense of progression that\u2019s mirrored in other aspects of the game. Complete a mission and you\u2019ll get to rip open a brown envelope containing a new scenario. Along the way you\u2019ll discover powerful new character abilities and ways to abuse your unfortunate mech, a process that feels a little like uncovering new game elements in 2015\u2019s critically acclaimed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jan/25/pandemic-legacy-review-emotional-highs-agonising-lows\">Pandemic Legacy</a>. Even during individual missions it\u2019s possible to level-up your character, activating powers as a reward for stomping, slashing, eviscerating and electrocuting your way through wave after wave of foes.</p> <p>It all adds up to an intense and compelling experience. Riot staffers insist that the company has no plans to produce future board games, and that Mechs vs Minions is a one-off love letter to the tabletop hobby. If that\u2019s true, it\u2019s a pity. Even as someone with minimal experience of League of Legends, I\u2019m ready for more.</p>",

One of these is musical training.

Professional musicians are highly skilled performers who spend years training, and they provide a natural laboratory in which neuroscientists can study how such changes \u2013 referred to as <a href=\"https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/neuroplasticity\" rel=\"nofollow\">experience-dependent plasticity</a> \u2013 occur <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2996135/\" rel=\"nofollow\">across their lifespan</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/oct/08/is-the-internet-killing-our-brains\">Is the internet killing our brains?</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>Changes in brain structure<br></h2> <p>Early brain scanning studies revealed significant differences in brain structure between musicians and non-musicians of the same age. For example, the corpus callosum, a massive bundle of nerve fibres connecting the two sides of the brain, is <a href=\"http://www.musicianbrain.com/papers/Schlaug_CCallosum_1995b.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">significantly larger in musicians</a>. The brain areas involved in movement, <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v392/n6678/full/392811a0.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">hearing</a>, and visuo-spatial abilities also appear to be <a href=\"http://www.jneurosci.org/content/23/27/9240.full\" rel=\"nofollow\">larger in professional keyboard players</a>. And, the area devoted to processing touch sensations from the left hand is <a href=\"http://public.wsu.edu/~fournier/Teaching/psych592/Readings/Elbert_et_al_2005.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">increased in violinists</a>. </p> <p>These studies compared data from different groups of people at one point in time. As such, they could not determine whether the observed differences were actually caused by musical training, or if existing anatomical differences predispose some to become musicians. But later, longitudinal studies that track people over time have shown that young children who do 14 months of musical training exhibit significant <a href=\"http://www.musicianbrain.com/papers/Hyde_MusicTraining_BrainPlasticity_nyas_04852.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">structural</a> (pdf) and <a href=\"http://www.musicianbrain.com/papers/Schlaug_Music_Child_Brain_NYAS2005.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">functional brain changes</a> (pdf) compared to those who do not. <br></p> <p>Together, these studies show that learning to play a musical instrument not only increases grey matter volume in various brain regions, but can also strengthen the long-range connections between them. Other research shows that <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v396/n6707/abs/396128a0.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">musical training also enhances verbal memory</a>, <a href=\"http://www.artsedsearch.org/summaries/learning-to-make-music-enhances-spatial-reasoning\" rel=\"nofollow\">spatial reasoning</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4664655/\" rel=\"nofollow\">literacy skills</a>, such that professional musicians usually outperform non-musicians on these abilities. </p> <h2><strong>Long-lasting benefits for musicians</strong><br></h2> <p>Importantly, the brain scanning studies show that the extent of anatomical change in musicians\u2019 brains is closely related to the age at which musical training began, and the intensity of training. Those who started training at the youngest age showed the largest changes when compared to non-musicians. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Music reaches parts of the brain that other things can\u2019t</p> <footer> <cite>Catherine Loveday, University of Westminster</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Even short periods of musical training in early childhood can have long-lasting benefits. In <a href=\"http://jneurosci.org/content/33/45/17667.full\" rel=\"nofollow\">one 2013 study</a>, for example, researchers recruited 44 older adults and divided them into three groups based on the level of formal musical training they had received as children. Participants in one group had received no training at all; those in the second had done a little training, defined as between one and three years of lessons; and those in the third had received moderate levels of training (four to 14 years).</p> <p>The researchers played recordings of complex speech sounds to the participants, and used scalp electrodes to measure the timing of neural responses in a part of the auditory brainstem. As we age, the precision of this timing deteriorates, making it difficult to understand speech, especially in environments with a lot of background noise. Participants who had received moderate amounts of musical training exhibited <a href=\"http://www.jneurosci.org/content/33/45/17667.full\" rel=\"nofollow\">the fastest neural responses</a>, suggesting that even limited training in childhood can preserve sharp processing of speech sounds and increase resilience to age-related decline in hearing.</p> <p>More recently, it has become clear that musical training facilitates the <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17260171\" rel=\"nofollow\">rehabilitation of patients recovering from stroke</a> and other forms of brain damage, and some researchers now argue that it might also <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4411999/\" rel=\"nofollow\">boost speech processing and learning in children with dyslexia</a> and other language impairments. What\u2019s more, the benefits of musical training seem to persist for many years, or even decades, and the picture that emerges from this all evidence is that learning to play a musical instrument in childhood <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4269311/\" rel=\"nofollow\">protects the brain against the development of cognitive impairment and dementia</a>. <br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/sep/24/do-our-brains-have-extraordinary-untapped-powers\">Do our brains have extraordinary untapped powers?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Unlike commercial brain training products, which only improve performance on the skills involved, musical training has what psychologists refer to as transfer effects \u2013 in other words, learning to play a musical instrument seems to have a far broader effect on the brain and mental function, and improves other abilities that are seemingly unrelated. <br></p> <p>\u201cMusic reaches parts of the brain that other things can\u2019t,\u201d says Loveday. \u201cIt\u2019s a strong cognitive stimulus that grows the brain in a way that nothing else does, and the evidence that musical training enhances things like working memory and language is very robust.\u201d <br></p> <p>Learning to play a musical instrument, then, seems to be one of the most effective forms of brain training there is. Musical training can induce various structural and functional changes in the brain, depending on which instrument is being learned, and the intensity of the training regime.

  "<p>Here\u2019s a Trinity Mirror spokesperson <a href=\"http:///2016/news/fourth-newspaper-closure-announced-by-trinity-mirror-in-24-hours/\">commenting its latest local paper closure</a>: \u201cWe focus on markets where we are able to grow audience and revenue. It\u2019s for this reason we\u2019ve been forced to close free weekly, the Crawley News and its website\u201d.<br></p> <p>Not a startling revelation: we know that advertising has been retreating from newsprint for years, although the shuttering of the website is surprising.</p> <p>But the announcement was somewhat disingenuous because audience is not really the problem. Given that it is a free title, the publisher controls the level of distribution.</p> <p>What really hurts is the lack of sufficient advertising to turn a profit. And the motivation of a publicly quoted company is not about serving readers, but about serving advertisers.</p> <p>There are loads of readers in Crawley, which has a population well in excess of 100,000, and there is plenty of community news to report. </p> <p>Trinity Mirror knows that, but it doesn\u2019t want to reveal the brutal truth: profit outweighs public service.

It has been the case since the founding of a commercial press at the end of the 19th century.</p> <p>But plenty of people don\u2019t know it. Publishers who are taking an axe to editorial staff on a weekly basis are fooling audiences. They pay lip service to serving the public but their real intent is to squeeze the greatest possible profit from their portfolio. </p> <p>This runs counter to the journalistic mission to inform, educate and entertain. By turning their backs on journalism they are making it more and more difficult for us to hold power to account. </p> <p>Meanwhile, seen from the other perspective, advertisers are increasingly intent on overlooking the value of newsprint. </p> <p>I found myself nodding at an observation by John Witherow, editor of the Times, <a href=\"http://www.campaignlive.co.uk/article/john-witherow-bucks-print-decline-times/1412896#\">in a Campaign interview</a>. He said of falling print ad revenues: \u201cA lot of them don\u2019t seem to read newspapers in the ad agencies\u201d.</p> <p>They never have, of course. Journalism was always the annoying bit of newspaper content wrapped around their adverts. </p> <p>Note that Witherow was speaking against the background of the Times\u2019s print sales having risen while its ad revenues have fallen for six years in a row.</p> <p>It may well be an exaggeration to suggest that, between them, newspaper publishers and advertisers are conspiring to undermine journalism. But I\u2019ve said it all the same.</p>",

  "<p>Do US soccer leagues need their own Super Bowl, a week-long festival of the sport at a neutral site? Or should they reward the best regular-season team with home-field advantage for the final game?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/18/didier-drogba-fined-not-suspended-montreal\">Didier Drogba fined but not suspended for Montreal Impact tantrum</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Why not both?</p> <p>US leagues have long mimicked the big fish in the American pro sports pond, the NFL, by holding play-offs concluding with a neutral-site final. The NASL of the 1970s and 1980s even imitated the NFL\u2019s name, putting Pele, Franz Beckenbauer, Rodney Marsh and company in the \u201cSoccer Bowl\u201d.</p> <p>MLS changed that in 2012, moving the final to the home field of the highest remaining seed. The relaunched NASL also plays the new Soccer Bowl (technically the name for the trophy and not the game, as of 2014) at a home field. The NWSL has gone the other direction, playing the last two finals at a neutral site.</p> <p>The neutral site has plenty of advantages. A league can plan out several days of festivities and meetings, bringing supporters, players, sponsors and executives together in one place without scrambling for last-minute plane tickets and hotel accommodations. Neutral-site MLS Cups had a colorful convention atmosphere through the weekend, with events everywhere from swanky clubs to hotel conference rooms. Even in the NWSL, with its more modest resources, fans and reporters converged on Houston this month to see a thrilling final and chat about the sport.</p> <p>Purists, though, want to reward regular-season performance. If home-field advantage is on the line, those last few games in October will mean much more. It\u2019s especially rewarding for supporters, who can see their club compete for a championship without traveling. Clubs with a strong base of season-ticket holders will have no trouble filling their home grounds, even on short notice.</p> <p>If only soccer had some long-standing way of setting knockout competitions with two games rather than one. Perhaps we could call it a \u201ctwo-leg aggregate series\u201d. Oh, right. Soccer does indeed use such a format, in all sorts of competitions all over the world. But in this case, leagues can give it a twist.</p> <p>The two-leg format is meant to minimize home-field advantage, making each team play on each other\u2019s home ground, whether it\u2019s Barnsley v Fleetwood Town in the Football League Trophy semi-finals or Jordan battling Uruguay for a spot in the World Cup.</p> <p>To give the higher seed an advantage, give that team the first game of a two-leg final. The club gets a hot-selling home game, and the players get all the other advantages of playing on familiar turf. But instead of giving the second leg to the other finalist, hold that at a neutral site.</p> <p>The lower-seeded finalist may disagree, but the format is a win-win. The league can advertise the time and place for its biggest game months in advance, plotting out events for sponsors and supporters to enjoy. And yet the higher-seeded team gets a just reward for winning that last game in October.</p> <p>Other US sports don\u2019t need to tinker with their play-offs. In the NFL, the conference champions play few teams in common through the unbalanced regular season, and there\u2019s no reason to give one team a home-field advantage. The seven-game series in baseball, basketball and hockey are perfectly fair \u2013 though baseball could and should drop the insistence that the league that wins the All-Star Game, where the prime directive is to avoid wearing out pitchers\u2019 arms, gets the home-field edge in the World Series. They also have other occasions \u2013 the All-Star Game, the draft \u2013 for which the league can plan several days of festivities.</p> <p>Soccer is different. MLS has an All-Star Game, but it often shares the stage in soccer\u2019s cluttered summer months with a World Cup or other international tournaments. MLS and the NWSL hold their drafts at the NSCAA (national soccer coaches) convention, a good meeting point for people in the soccer business but largely inaccessible to the general public.</p> <p>And MLS has the perfect stadium situation for a mixed two-leg series. Most clubs today play in smaller stadiums whose schedule they control. These grounds are perfect for the first leg of a final series. The second leg can be held in a larger venue.</p> <p>Spreading out the final also gives fans more time to make travel plans to that second leg. The game\u2019s crowd can have more fans of the specific teams, not just neutral fans who love the sport or the event.</p> <p>And the two-leg series will give everyone plenty of talking points for the second leg. What adjustments will each team make? If the top seed won the first leg, can their opponents bounce back? If the lower seed held the top seed in the first leg, will that stop the top seed\u2019s momentum?</p> <p>Maybe the media, still focused on the traditional \u201cBig Four\u201d sports, will take notice for a change.</p>",

The transport, food and accommodation budget for this ambassador will be slim and you don\u2019t have to worry about her saying anything off-brand because between them, the UN and DC control every word she says. There\u2019s simply none of the difficulty or fuss of working with a real-life woman. If anything, this is a woman that refuses to be held back by her status as a work of fiction, and how many men can you say that about?</p>",

Free abortion and contraception are available, and women have equal rights in marriage, divorce and property ownership. In 2010, one-third of judges and more than four in 10 lawyers were female; <a href=\"https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/campaigns/2016/01/is-tunisia-the-beacon-of-womens-rights-it-claims-to-be/\">in 2013, 30% of Tunisia\u2019s engineers were women</a>.<br></p> <p>In 2014, three years after the revolution, equal opportunities were enshrined in a new constitution. Political parties were required by law to alternate men and women on electoral lists, ensuring substantial representation in parliament. In April 2014, Tunisia lifted its reservations to the <a href=\"http://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/cedaw/\">UN Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women</a>.<br></p> <p>But in socially conservative towns and villages, men and women continue to follow traditional roles.

Victims of domestic violence are frequently pressed to drop complaints for the sake of family unity and reputation.<br></p> <p>Though recognised as a specific crime since 1993, family violence is widely accepted as \u201cnormal\u201d. In 2012-13, two-thirds of the 5,575 complaints of marital violence lodged with the authorities were withdrawn or dismissed; only 10% resulted in convictions. The police may refuse to investigate complaints and allegations \u2013 and sometimes they are the perpetrators.<br></p> <p>Siham Beji knows this all too well.

The <a href=\"http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/presscenter/articles/2014/06/09/tunisia-launches-truth-and-dignity-commission.html\">Truth and Dignity Commission, established by the post-revolution government</a>, has received 15,000 complaints from women who were raped, tortured and degraded under the regimes of Ben Ali and his predecessor, Habib Bourguiba.<br></p> <p>According to Ibtihel Abdellatif, the body\u2019s commissioner for women, the number does not reflect the scale of violence against women. \u201cFor every man put in jail, be sure there were at least four women who were also victims \u2013 mothers, wives, sisters, daughters,\u201d she said.<br></p> <p>\u201cMen coming out of prison were seen as heroes, they were respected in their communities. But for women who were sexually abused, there was a terrible stigma. Many girls coming out of prison weren\u2019t accepted back into their families. There are women who have never told their husbands what happened.<br></p> <p>\u201cMany who have come to us say they don\u2019t want reparation, they just want a chance to say what happened, how it destroyed their lives, how they were rejected by society. The impact on women was much greater than the impact on men.\u201d<br></p> <p>The commission is attempting to deal with the past; the violence against women bill aims to give greater protection in the future. But the politicians promoting it hope for something more than legislative change.<br></p> <p>\u201cWe can\u2019t change people\u2019s lives simply by passing a law,\u201d said Labidi. \u201cWe change lives by education, raising awareness, changing the language around violence against women.\u201d<br></p> <p>According to Ounissi: \u201cPassing the law is the beginning of the process, not the end. You need the support of the education system; this starts at school. You need a training programme for the police. And you need to look at television shows that normalise violence. People are more influenced by what\u2019s on television than what\u2019s in a parliamentary bill.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"94e555e655b3d1772cfd1903ce302bf0a606da0b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/94e555e655b3d1772cfd1903ce302bf0a606da0b/4_52_570_342/500.jpg\" alt=\"Idihar Chaieb\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Idihar Chaieb: \u2018I hope justice will be done\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Harriet Sherwood/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Ounissi, the daughter of an imam added: \u201cThe mosques also play a major social role. These people are public servants, they are paid by the state \u2013 so we need to get the ministry of religion involved. If we can monitor imams for signs of radicalisation, we can monitor them for what they say on domestic violence. I don\u2019t think it will be difficult.\u201d<br></p> <p>The Ennahdha party was historically labelled \u201cIslamist\u201d, but six months ago it ditched that description in favour of \u201cMuslim democrat\u201d. The move, which followed a three-year process, was overwhelmingly supported at Ennahdha\u2019s congress last spring. The movement draws comparisons with European Christian Democratic parties, saying its new label reflects a forward-looking democratic reformist party rooted in Islamic values.<br></p> <p>Ennahdha \u2013 now a partner in the coalition government \u2013 expects the violence against women bill to win strong parliamentary support, although some compromises may be required before a final vote.<br></p> <p>Amna Guellali, senior Tunisia researcher at <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/\">Human Rights Watch</a>, said the bill was a \u201ccomprehensive framework for fighting violence against women\u201d. All state institutions were mandated to incorporate it but \u201cits practical impact will depend on a willingness of the state to provide the means of implementation. In Tunisia we have a tradition of passing good laws, but the reality on the ground is more complicated,\u201d she said.<br></p> <p>For Chaieb, any move that strengthens the rights of women is to be welcomed. Her story has taken a turn for the better since she lost her case against her predatory boss.</p> <p>Women\u2019s organisations helped her financially by investing in a small grocery shop she opened, and by finding her a lawyer prepared to act on a pro bono basis. In March, Chaieb returned to court, and this time her former boss was found guilty of sexual harassment and fined 25,000 dinars (\u00a39,000).<br></p> <p>A further appeal is yet to be heard, and Chaieb has not received any money. \u201cBut what happened to me has been recognised,\u201d she said. \u201cI hope justice has been and will be done.\u201d<br></p>",

The timing is no coincidence: racist police brutality persists, and Donald Trump promises to entrench racial divides. The vibe of many of these records, notably Solange\u2019s fluid A Seat At The Table and Blood Orange\u2019s Freetown Sound, has been understated and contemplative. But one lesser-cited standout addresses issues of identity with firework-bright energy.</p> <p>In June, Brooklyn-based musician Xenia Rubinos released her second album, Black Terry Cat, a vibrant voyage through her psyche \u2013 \u201cWelcoming folks into the way I hear music,\u201d as she says, calling from tour in Tucson, Arizona. She unleashes MIA-like invective on Mexican Chef, a tart skit about the undervalued work that keeps the States afloat.

On I Won\u2019t Say she quotes from civil rights activist Abbey Lincoln\u2019s 1966 essay Who Will Revere The Black Woman?, and amid See Them\u2019s gnashing synths, Rubinos poses the record\u2019s key question: \u201cYou know where to put the brown girl when she\u2019s fuckin\u2019 it up.

That's scary\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Born to a Puerto Rican mother and a Cuban father, 31-year-old Rubinos questions the limitations that other people put on her identity, including the artistic ghettoisation she experiences when her music is labelled \u201cLatin\u201d. Such pigeonholing flattens her sound\u2019s wild abandon and ambition. She graduated from the prestigious Berklee College Of Music with a degree in jazz composition, got her start playing DIY house shows in her Brooklyn apartment, and is currently signed to ANTI-, a division of punk label Epitaph. Indeed, on Black Terry Cat, she thrashes as hard as Shellac, flows like Erykah Badu, and matches the strut of classic Daptone records. Because of this, she says, \u201cIt\u2019s infuriating when I feel someone\u2019s not listening and just looking at my face or name and assuming.\u201d</p> <p>That miscategorisation, coupled with the rise of the Black Lives Matter movement, inspired Rubinos to investigate her own heritage while writing Black Terry Cat. Tracing her roots back to her Spanish grandfather and African great-grandmother, she began defining as Afro-Latina (rather than the disputed ethnonyms Latino and Hispanic). She says she wasn\u2019t aware of that designation when she was younger, but a surge in Latin media has finally offered proper representations of her background; even listicles about \u201cthings you only know when you have a Puerto Rican grandma\u201d help, she says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7c08f887dbe7b031d571387b6110ec8632302a55\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7c08f887dbe7b031d571387b6110ec8632302a55/0_275_4724_2835/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Xenia Rubinos on stage in Bilbao, 2013.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Xenia Rubinos on stage in Bilbao, 2013.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jordi Vidal/Redferns</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cBack then, I didn\u2019t see myself [re]presented in media in any kind of way that was relatable or authentic,\u201d says Rubinos. \u201cIt\u2019s cool to have these things now to help me navigate my experience.\u201d</p> <p>Since its release, Black Terry Cat\u2019s themes have felt ever more pressing. The emotionally frantic Black Stars was inspired by the death of Rubinos\u2019s father after complications from Parkinson\u2019s disease, but she says its lyrics took on extra meaning after 18-year-old Michael Brown was shot dead by police in Ferguson, Missouri in 2014. The week we speak, there are reports of police killing more unarmed black men in Oklahoma and North Carolina. But, Rubinos says, it\u2019s just as limiting to call her a \u201cpolitical artist\u201d as it is to call her a Latin one. \u201cBecause I\u2019m saying things about being a brown girl in America, suddenly it\u2019s a protest album,\u201d she says dismissively. \u201cI\u2019m just talking about real shit that\u2019s happening around us.\u201d She references Nina Simone: \u201cShe was socially engaged and wrote a lot of provocative songs, but she was a great composer, a great pianist, a great vocalist.

  "<p>At this time last year there were <a href=\"http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000566216/article/record-five-undefeated-teams-remain-after-week-7\">five undefeated teams</a> in the NFL. As of right now, there are zero. The Philadelphia Eagles <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/23/nfl-scores-jay-ajayi-rushing-record?CMP=share_btn_tw\">defeated</a> the Minnesota Vikings 21-10 on Sunday, handing Sam Bradford and Co their first loss of the season and dropping their record to 5-1. There\u2019s been a clear shift in the NFL towards parity over the last 12 months, and it may not be a great one for the immediate health of the league, especially after the onslaught of ugly games that have been bombarding viewers of late.<br></p> <p>The Vikings-Eagles was Exhibit A (Exhibit B, the stinker between the Cardinals and Seahawks was, unfortunately, to follow later). The two teams combined for five turnovers in the game\u2019s first quarter alone. Philadelphia exploited Minnesota\u2019s battered offensive line: Bradford was <a href=\"https://theringer.com/nfl-week-7-andrew-luck-geno-smith-winners-losers-b765614af718#.ba3p60h36\">sacked six times</a> by his old team, fumbled twice and threw for just one touchdown to go along with an interception. The Vikings offense managed just 93 yards rushing and couldn\u2019t capitalize on Eagles QB Carson Wentz\u2019s two early interceptions. And the Cardinals-Seahawks game was even worse: two of the best quarterbacks in the league failed to throw a single touchdown pass between them over four excruciating quarters and overtime, before the kickers \u2013 men whose only job is to kick a football quite far \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000727028/article/dont-let-your-children-become-kickers\">missed the chippiest of chip shots</a> to leave those viewers still sentient with a 6-6 final scoreline. NFL.com tried to sell it as a \u201chistoric tie\u201d on Monday morning. That\u2019s one way of describing it \u2013 there were a few other opinions shooting around though:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/richarddeitsch/status/790403414241009665\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">NFL Twitter: <a href=\"https://t.co/mmPae8jmcV\">pic.twitter.com/mmPae8jmcV</a></p>&mdash; Richard Deitsch (@richarddeitsch) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/richarddeitsch/status/790403414241009665\">October 24, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Minnesota\u2019s performance has ensured that every team has already suffered at least one loss this season. That\u2019s a far cry from last year where the Denver Broncos, Cincinnati Bengals, New England Patriots, Green Bay Packers and Carolina Panthers were all undefeated after Week 7. The Panthers, notably, lost only a single game before reaching the Super Bowl. <br></p> <p>Now, these Vikings were never as talented as any of those teams. No one was seriously expecting them to flirt with a perfect season a la Carolina. In fact, in the first few weeks of the season, very few would have pegged them as being the last undefeated team, not after they lost both franchise players \u2013 Teddy Bridgewater (<a href=\"http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/theres-concern-teddy-bridgewater-might-never-make-it-back-to-the-nfl/\">possibly for good</a>) and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2016/sep/19/new-england-patriots-offense-defense-jimmp-garopollo-injury\">Adrian Peterson</a> \u2013 to injuries. </p> <p>Which is not to say that Minnesota are a bad team, and they\u2019re especially not as bad as they looked during the debacle in Philly. They\u2019re a very good team, and should still be favored to win their division, but they\u2019re just not a great team. In fact, there may not currently be any great teams in the league. <br></p> <p>Look at how the teams that were undefeated at his stage last season are doing this time around. The two-loss Broncos have had to lean on their secondary after saying goodbye to Peyton Manning and Brock Osweiler over the offseason. The Patriots can blame their one loss on not having either Tom Brady or Jimmy Garoppolo available, but their iffy defense and kicker Stephen Gostkowski\u2019s case of the yips aren\u2019t exactly intimidating the rest of the league. Green Bay\u2019s Aaron Rodgers, despite lighting up the woeful Chicago Bears on Thursday, hasn\u2019t looked like his perennial MVP candidate self. The Bengals started the season 3-4 while the Panthers are suffering a malady several degrees worse than a mere \u201cSuper Bowl hangover.\u201d<br></p> <p>Apart from whatever\u2019s happening in Carolina, this is the normal state of things. Fortunes rise and fall in the NFL, it\u2019s the whole ancient Greek drama aspect of the sport. The issue is that there aren\u2019t really any teams who have risen fully up the ranks in response. The Dallas Cowboys might be the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2016/oct/17/dallas-cowboys-dak-prescott-tony-romo-nfl\">best team in the league</a>, but nobody fully trusts them. The Atlanta Falcons just suffered two straight heartbreaking losses in a row. The Pittsburgh Steelers could be starting Landry Jones in place of the hurt Ben Roethlisberger for <a href=\"http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/ben-roethlisberger-could-reportedly-miss-more-than-a-month-with-knee-injury/\">the next month</a>. Even when they win, the Seattle Seahawks have been making fans sleepy.<br></p> <p>As much as we love the idea of every team having an equal chance, the NFL is more entertaining when there are a few Goliaths out there. It\u2019s worth wondering if the comparatively mediocre field has contributed to the noticeable <a href=\"https://sports.vice.com/en_us/highlight/maybe-nfl-ratings-are-down-because-the-games-are-bad\">dip in quality</a> of the on-field product this year. Wins seem to be decided by who makes the fewest moronic mistakes \u2013 or aren\u2019t decided at all when, as we saw in the Seahawks-Cardinals game, two of the \u201cbest\u201d teams in the league can\u2019t even kick a 24-yard field goal. The blowout victories inspire more boredom than awe while the close games feel more sloppy than thrilling. It\u2019s perhaps fitting that one of the most competitive games of the year ended on a <a href=\"http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2016/10/16/falcons-livid-about-missed-pass-interference-call/\">botched pass interference call</a>.</p> <p>Hopefully, this is a temporary thing. We\u2019re not quite halfway through the season, there\u2019s still plenty of time for some of these good teams to emerge as great ones. Unfortunately for Minnesota, Sunday\u2019s ugly loss doesn\u2019t bode well for their chances of being one of them.<br></p> <h2>Quote of the week</h2> <p><em>\u201cYes, this man signs my son\u2019s checks as I\u2019ve been reminded on Twitter.

The relationship between the first and second law officers of Australia was \u201cirretrievably broken\u201d, he said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/oct/24/solicitor-general-justin-gleeson-quits-over-broken-relationship--george-brandis\">Solicitor general Justin Gleeson resigns over 'broken' relationship with George Brandis</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Gleeson\u2019s letter amounts to what is effectively a curse on the attorney general, George Brandis. Gleeson was emphatic. He hopes his resignation will better allow the Senate to get to the bottom of the whole sorry saga.</p> <p>\u201cMy decision does not amount to a withdrawal of any position I have taken in relation to matters of controversy between us, including before the Senate legal and constitutional affairs committee,\u201d he writes. </p> <p>\u201cI trust that it will in fact better enable the parliament to make an objective consideration of the issues I have raised undistracted by the personalities.</p> <p>\u201cFor the avoidance of any doubt, I also make plain that I reject absolutely each and every attack and insinuation that has been made in recent times upon me personally or upon my office by government members of parliament, including you in Senate committee processes.\u201d</p> <p>The dispute revolves around whether Brandis consulted Gleeson on his directive that any requests to the solicitor general\u2019s office for legal advice from other areas of government should be approved by the attorney general. Brandis told the Senate he did consult. Gleeson has maintained Brandis did not. </p> <p>Gleeson was also unhappy that he was not properly consulted on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/oct/06/george-brandis-contradicts-solicitor-general-and-says-justin-gleeson-was-consulted\">a controversial citizenship bill that split the Abbott cabinet</a>, even though Brandis subsequently claimed that Gleeson had advised it could withstand challenge in the high court. </p> <p>The dispute culminated in an extraordinary showdown in front of a Senate committee.</p> <p>We saw an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/oct/15/ian-macdonald-could-do-with-a-lesson-on-the-art-of-respectful-questioning\">Liberal National party senator yelling at Gleeson</a> and Gleeson standing his ground. </p> <p>We saw Gleeson declaring that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/oct/14/gleeson-says-he-ignored-invalid-direction-from-brandis-to-seek-consent\">he considered the Brandis directive invalid</a>.</p> <p>We saw Gleeson revealing he had given advice on the Senate composition and Brandis pointing out he was \u201castonished\u201d Gleeson would reveal such a thing without his permission.</p> <p>We saw Gleeson reveal that he had spoken to Labor shadow attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, in the caretaker period before the election. Not a clever move, given the election and the politics around an already deteriorating relationship. </p> <p>This open warfare could only end in one way. Someone had to go. In his letter to Gleeson, Brandis said his resignation was the \u201cproper course to take\u201d.</p> <p>As a result, Gleeson will leave before the next sitting of parliament on 7 November.</p> <p>The next day the Senate committee, dominated by the opposition and minor parties, will give their report on the dispute. Given the numbers on the committee, it is not likely to be good for the government. <br></p> <p>What happens next? Labor has already moved to disallow the legal directive and Labor would need to win the numbers to do that. The minority Senate could well censure Brandis. Given that the numbers were there to hold the committee inquiry in the first place, both of these options are possible.</p> <p>While Malcolm Turnbull has stood by his attorney general, within the Coalition Brandis has made it clear that he wants to leave parliament in this term. Ensuring this story has a way to run. Gleeson\u2019s curse could yet take hold. </p>",

  "<p><strong>Hometown: </strong>Stockholm. </p> <p><strong>The lineup:</strong> Johen Rafael Tilli (piano, production) and Mayka Edd (vocals, lyrics). </p> <p><strong>The background: </strong>When it comes to pop music, the primary school-age sector is an underserved demographic. In the 70s, a lot of the glam acts \u2013 Sweet, Slade, Suzi Quatro \u2013 seemed to tailor their singles specifically to the demands of break-time, with their high stomp factor and chant quotient: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y64211sjSko\">Blockbuster</a>, Cum on Feel the Noize, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYoogY-UGio\">Can the Can</a>. But today, the eight-year-old or younger is often overlooked by marketing types and musicians. Not by <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/deathteammusic\">Death Team</a> though, a Swedish duo whose insidious hip-hop-pop is aimed squarely at the playground, more for the cadences and catchiness than anything else.</p> <p>\u201cChildren love them,\u201d says Mayka Edd, the frontwoman whose sing-song tone telegraphs her snarky smartness, and the one \u201cresponsible\u201d (term used advisedly) for Death Team\u2019s lyrics. She points out that the Swedish media has a relaxed attitude towards colourful language, hence Death Team\u2019s ubiquity on Swedish daytime radio and increasing familiarity among children. \u201cI\u2019ve heard a lot of stories from parents where their four-year-old daughters are singing, \u2018I\u2019m the kind of person you don\u2019t wanna fuck with!\u2019 In Sweden you can play everything.\u201d </p> <p>To be fair, not every Death Team song features F-bombs, but they are all madly memorable almost to the point of mania. They have the nagging infectiousness of the best novelty pop (or worst, depending on your view), with Mayka\u2019s breathy high-on-helium voice contrasting disconcertingly with the sometimes base messages (they\u2019ve just written a song called Murder). They had described themselves as \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/abba\">Abba</a> meets <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/eminem\">Eminem</a>\u201d, Mayka claiming that the music of the Swedish super-popsters \u201cis in our DNA\u201d, but their newest material is heavier, more metallic, leading her to suggest they are becoming more \u201cSystem of a Down meets <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mGBaXPlri8\">t.A.T.u.</a>\u201d.

As for \u201cDeath Team\u201d, they chose the name because it sounded like a metal band, and because they had a song \u201cabout a badass cheerleading squad, so we took the name for ourselves\u201d. </p> <p>They formed the band two years ago when strategic thinker Johen was a struggling movie animator and Mayka was working as a DJ. At first, they were a sort of \u201cfantasy punk band\u201d, before mutating into what they do now, which is not, Mayka would like to stress, comedy rap-pop, even if they do have a song called Dolphin Style in which she compares herself to the titular mammal. </p> <p>\u201cWe don\u2019t want to get stuck in some crazy party band idea,\u201d she says. \u201cWe love having fun but we want to do more serious music, too. We want to be a good band who can move people and create songs that people love.\u201d</p> <p>Spin magazine voted Fucking Bitches in the Hood the ninth best song of last year, writing: \u201cIt\u2019s the most perfectly WTF rap verse of 2015.\u201d And it has been streamed 2.5m times on Spotify. Dolphin Style puts Katherine Hamnett-style slogans (\u201cGhetto life / Get a life\u201d) in a kindie-pop context. So Fresh finds them \u201cCruisin\u2019 like a soda pop / Top down, super hot\u201d, while Gold simultaneously critiques and celebrates conspicuous rap consumption (\u201cAnd my RayBans made of gold / All my fans made of gold / My Versace made of gold\u201d) with a descending keyboard motif that sounds like a 90s house piano falling downstairs. With its repetitive banjo riff and \u201cWe are the kids and we don\u2019t want our medicine\u201d chorus, Kids could be a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VcDy8HEg1QY\">Cotton Eye Joe by Rednex</a>-style fluke smash.

  "<p><strong>A few months ago, my husband, who had been out drinking, wanted to have sex when I got in from work.

  "<p>Search for \u201cjury service\u201d online and you will soon stumble across ways to get out of doing jury service. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2016/aug/23/the-right-plea-to-escape-jury-service\" title=\"\">These aren\u2019t always the most practical or legal</a>: unless you\u2019re prepared to fake a pregnancy, book an impromptu cruise or stick two pencils up your nose, Blackadder style, and say \u201cwibble\u201d a lot, you\u2019re probably going to have to do jury service.</p> <p>This is a good thing. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2005/jun/12/workandcareers.observercashsection\" title=\"\">Jury service can be a&#xa0;disruptive, inconvenient pain</a> in the neck, but it\u2019s also a vital public service and one of the cornerstones of our ... (all right, Dad, cut out the lecture). But here\u2019s another reason why doing jury service is a good thing: it could turn out to be one of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/aug/20/jury-service-repeated-summons\" title=\"\">most fascinating and rewarding experiences of your life</a>.</p> <p>I didn\u2019t anticipate this. The court letter telling me I was being summoned for jury service was the first thing I opened when I got home from hospital with my newborn daughter (my actual baby, not one I had borrowed from the hospital in the hope of getting out of jury service, although, thinking about it now, that\u2019s not the <em>worst</em> idea). In the state I was in at that moment, it was hard to care or even process what the letter was saying.&#xa0;It could have announced that I had won bronze in this year\u2019s Latvian jelly sculpture awards, or informed me that I was being summoned for execution by the holographic overlords of the&#xa0;planet Quargum, and I would still probably have tossed it underneath some electricity bills and gone off to work out how to clean milky sick off the sofa.</p> <p>But eventually my brain regained some kind of coherence and, on a Monday morning about two months later, I found myself arriving at court, as nervous as I&#xa0;was curious. Courts are serious and intimidating places, and probably seem even more serious and intimidating if you speak to pop musicians for a living. They\u2019re also the kind of places that invite you to invent stories about the people you see huddled outside \u2013 who are they, how did they end up here? This isn\u2019t ideal. Your job as a juror is largely to avoid doing this, at least when you\u2019re sitting on a jury. You are urged to keep an open mind. And, if you do so, you will find a whole list of prejudices you never knew you had come crashing down with each passing day.</p> <p>This was especially the case, at least for me, in terms of all the jurors I met during the two weeks. In 2016, we seem to have accepted the notion that the UK is divided, the Brexit vote a perfect emblem of a country where one half barely recognises the other, let alone goes out drinking with them on a Friday night; a place where old and young, rich and poor, are all pitted against each other. What\u2019s more, we\u2019ve become adept at reinforcing our differences by constructing personal online bubbles \u2013 reading news that fits our opinions and connecting with people who share similar interests.</p> <p>Believe me, there\u2019s nothing like a stint on a jury to cut through all that \u2013 you are thrown together with people from all walks of life. In the space of two weeks, I got to know builders, entrepreneurs, football referees, cooks, NHS workers, butlers and&#xa0;IT consultants. The jury on which I served was a&#xa0;mix of age, gender, race, religions, backgrounds ... you would almost think, having read the news over the past year or so, that we would be unable to communicate. And yet not only did we complete our task with dedication, but we also got along famously. When our case was over, we even went to the pub together. I felt sad that we would probably never see each other again.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/shortcuts/2013/feb/21/10-things-jurors-need-to-know\" title=\"\">I\u2019m forbidden by law from telling you any juicy details of the case</a> (spoiler: not actually that juicy) or revealing any of the fascinating stories that jurors shared about their lives. I especially can\u2019t tell you about my heartfelt and moving speech that convinced the entire jury to change their decision at the last minute, although that\u2019s mainly because it didn\u2019t happen (other than in my head, every morning, on the way in).</p> <p>For those reasons, I realise that this column may lack drama. I accept that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/oct/14/james-acaster-favourite-juries-12-angry-men-broadchurch\" title=\"\">12 Reasonable Men and Women Who Respected Each Other\u2019s Opinions and Got Along Nicely</a> would not make for a particularly interesting sequel, not even if it focused on the dramatic scene during deliberations where I ate so many jelly sweets that I got a headache. But the experience did more for me than fulfil my sense of civic duty \u2013 it re-established my faith in humanity and gave me a small flicker of hope that, actually, we all might just be able to get along in&#xa0;future.</p>",

On Saturday, the Republican presidential nominee, Donald Trump, promised to block it because it would \u201cdestroy democracy\u201d. On Sunday, Hillary Clinton\u2019s running mate, Tim Kaine, said he was \u201cpro-competition\u201d.</p> <p>The companies\u2019 bosses announced late on Saturday night that they had signed a deal \u2013 the biggest corporate takeover of the year \u2013 which was a \u201cperfect match\u201d of firms to \u201cbring a fresh approach to how the media and communications industry works\u201d.</p> <p>The deal, unanimously approved by both companies\u2019 boards, values Time Warner at $107.50 a share \u2013 a 20% premium on its closing price on Friday. It unites a historic phone company that traces its roots back more than 130 years to Alexander Graham Bell, the inventor of the telephone, with the producer of some of the world\u2019s most popular movies and TV shows, including Veep and Game of Thrones.</p> <p>AT&amp;T and Time Warner would have combined market value of more than $310bn. If the deal goes through and the companies aren\u2019t forced to sell assets, it would have AT&amp;T\u2019s assets of more than 130 million mobile phone customers and 25 million pay-TV subscribers through DirecTV, which AT&amp;T bought for $50bn in 2015, as well as Time Warner\u2019s extensive collection of Hollywood movies and TV channels and productions. Time Warner owns Warner Brothers (Harry Potter and Batman) as well as HBO, CNN and DC Comics. It also holds a 10% stake in the streaming service Hulu. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Randall Stephenson, AT&amp;T\u2019s chief executive, who will lead the combined company, said the corporate tie-up would transform consumers\u2019 experience of watching media on their phones at a time when many young people are giving up on pay TV. </p> <p>\u201cWe believe premium content is always going to win,\u201d he said, on a late night conference call announcing the deal. \u201cThat\u2019s been true on the big screen, the TV screen and we believe it is true on the mobile screen.</p> <p>\u201cWhen we combine Time Warner content with our scale and distribution \u2026 we\u2019re going to have something really special.\u201d</p> <p>The deal faces the prospect of a tough battle with politicians and regulators fearful that such a tie-up could lead to less consumer choice, higher prices and a possible threat to media plurality.<br></p> <p>Trump has vowed to block the deal if he wins next month\u2019s election. In <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/22/donald-trump-gettysburg-contract-with-america-sue-accusers-hillary-clinton\">a speech in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania</a>, on Saturday, he said it would give the combined company \u201ctoo much concentration of power\u201d.<br></p> <p>Speaking about his continuing battle with the \u201cdishonest mainstream media\u201d, Trump said: \u201cThey\u2019re trying desperately to suppress my vote and the voice of the American people.</p> <p>\u201cAs an example of the power structure I\u2019m fighting, AT&amp;T is buying Time Warner and thus CNN, a deal we will not approve in my administration because it\u2019s too much concentration of power in the hands of too few.\u201d</p> <p>Trump said he would also consider \u201cbreaking\u201d up the last big media deal, Comcast\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/feb/13/comcast-general-electric-nbc-universal-rockefeller-plaza?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+theguardian%2Fmedia%2Frss+%28Media%29\">acquisition of NBC Universal in 2013</a>. \u201cDeals like this destroy democracy,\u201d he said.</p> <p>On Sunday, Peter Navarro, a senior adviser to Trump, said the deal was evidence of the \u201cmonopoly power of media conglomerates\u201d. \u201cAT&amp;T, the original and abusive \u201cMa Bell\u201d telephone monopoly, is now trying to buy Time Warner and thus the wildly anti-Trump CNN,\u201d Navarro said. \u201cDonald Trump would never approve such a deal because it concentrates too much power in the hands of the too and powerful few.\u201d</p> <p>Hillary Clinton did not immediately comment but she has promised to bring in tougher scrutiny on big corporations. Earlier this month she vowed to \u201cstrengthen anti-trust enforcement and really scrutinise mergers and acquisitions, so the big don\u2019t keep getting bigger and bigger\u201d. </p> <p>Kaine told NBC\u2019s Meet the Press on Sunday: \u201cI\u2019m pro-competition. Less concentration, I think, is generally helpful, especially in the media.\u201d </p> <p>Clinton spokesman Brian Fallon later told reporters there were \u201ca number of questions and concerns\u201d about the deal but said that more needed to be known \u201cbefore any conclusions should be reached.\u201d </p> <p>Al Franken, a Democratic senator for Minnesota and regular critic of other cable and media tie-ups, said: \u201cI\u2019m skeptical of huge media mergers because they can lead to higher costs, fewer choices and even worse service for consumers.\u201d</p> <p>Senators Mike Lee and Amy Klobuchar, the Republican chair and ranking Democrat on the Senate subcommittee on antitrust, said in a joint statement: \u201cAn acquisition of Time Warner by AT&amp;T would potentially raise significant antitrust issues, which the subcommittee would carefully examine.\u201d</p> <p>A spokesman for Lee later said a hearing would be held sometime this year.</p> <p>The US Department of Justice and the Federal Communications Commission are also likely to review the deal, which comes shortly after cable provider Comcast took full control of NBC Universal. It is expected that the combined AT&amp;T/Time Warner group will have to promise to provide competitor content the same access to its customers as its own content.</p> <p>Disney executives have called for \u201cvery close regulatory scrutiny\u201d of the deal. </p> <p>Stephenson, who said he hoped the deal would be completed next year, said he did not expect any significant challenge from regulators as AT&amp;T is not buying up a direct competitor but adding to its business by purchasing a supplier. </p> <p>\u201cThis is not a horizontal deal. This is vertical merger,\u201d he said. \u201cYou would be hard-pressed to find examples where vertical mergers have been blocked.\u201d </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.freepress.net/person/21/craig-aaron\">Craig Aaron</a>, president of the consumer watchdog Free Press, said the deal would concentrate a \u201chuge amount of media power under one corporate umbrella\u201d and would likely lead to less customer choice and higher prices. </p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ll hear lots in the months ahead about supposed benefits, but history shows that mega-deals like this lead to higher prices, fewer choices and too much power in too few hands,\u201d he told the Guardian. </p> <p>\u201cWall Street pushes these deals for short-term gains but they\u2019re ultimately bad for business, larger economic growth and especially content creators and consumers. This deal will be a huge test about whether the next president is serious about antitrust. If they are, they\u2019ll move to block this deal.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/richbtig\">Richard Greenfield</a>, a media and technology at research firm BTIG, said the deal showed that Time Warner believes \u201cthe entire legacy media world is headed [for] secular decline\u201d.</p> <p>He said Jeff Bewkes, Time Warner\u2019s chairman and chief executive, would end up being remembered as \u201cthe smartest CEO in sector \u2013 knowing when to sell and not overstaying his welcome to maximize value for shareholders\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/aug/03/time-warner-buys-stake-hulu\">Time Warner buys 10% stake in Hulu</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Bewkes, who turned down an $85-a-share takeover approach from 21st Century Fox <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2014/jul/24/rupert-murdoch-time-warner\">two years ago</a>, said he would stay with the company for a handover period before stepping down.

  "<p>Hello guzzlers,</p> <p>Martin Gardner, who wrote dozens of books of recreational mathematics, would have been 102 last Friday. In the years since he died, his friends and fans have started a global movement called <a href=\"http://www.celebrationofmind.org/wordpress_site/\">Celebration of Mind</a>, which encourages people to put on puzzle-themed events on or around the date of his birthday. </p> <p>Please celebrate your minds right now by attempting these two gems from Gardner\u2019s archive. One is straightforward. The other may take you a little longer.</p> <p><em>1. At the hardware store, you are told that 1 will cost you 50p, 12 will cost \u00a31 and the price of 144 is \u00a31.50. What are you buying?</em><br></p> <p><em>2. Reconstruct the following long division:</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0eb1c5ef8c71c1011dbaff2a26d760b0773b93f4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0eb1c5ef8c71c1011dbaff2a26d760b0773b93f4/572_621_665_494/500.jpg\" alt=\"undefined\" width=\"500\" height=\"371\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>This is the long division of an eight digit number by a three digit number. All the digits in both numbers - and the workings out - have been replaced by Xs. Not only do you need to work out what digits the Xs are, you also need to calculate the answer, which is a five digit number with the 8 in its third position.</p> <p>The puzzle was one of Gardner\u2019s favourites. When I first came across it I was also spellbound - it didn\u2019t seem there was enough information to fill in the Xs. Once you remember how long divisions work, however, a few insights will lead you to the unique solution. Gardner wrote that the puzzle first appeared in 1954 in the <em>A</em><em>merican Mathematical Monthly, </em>and was its most popular problem ever. It still rocks 62 years later.</p> <p>I\u2019ll be back at 5pm UK with the answers.</p> <p>....................................................</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"2e053d19d26ad5fdb78374ffd961eb5a85bec96f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2e053d19d26ad5fdb78374ffd961eb5a85bec96f/0_0_1843_2409/765.jpg\" alt=\"Can You Solve My Problems\" width=\"765\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Can You Solve My Problems</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Guardian Faber</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><em>If you like this kind of puzzle, you may be interested in my new book which is out NEXT WEEK!! </em><em><a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/can-you-solve-my-problems.html\">Can You Solve My Problems?

  "<p>\u201cThe Comedian\u2019s Guide to Survival doesn\u2019t exist, you know,\u201d we\u2019re told towards the end of a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6p8rEx1b_A\">new British movie of that name</a>. \u201cYou can\u2019t succeed in comedy by guides and rules. It doesn\u2019t work like that.\u201d The speaker is Dustin Stratford (played by Vas Blackwood), one of the biggest comics in the world. He\u2019s talking to James Mullinger, a semi-fictional character based on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMdafuwbBLY\">the UK standup of the same name</a> and played by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/the-inbetweeners\">The Inbetweeners\u2019</a> James Buckley. The film \u2013 which is entertaining, not subtle and intriguing for standup fans \u2013 dramatises Mullinger\u2019s dog days as an aspiring but failing comedian, and (notwithstanding Stratford\u2019s cautionary advice) proposes itself as a primer on making it in comedy. So, what does it have to teach us?</p> <p>The first thing you\u2019ll notice is: life as a struggling club comic is nicer than you might think. Mullinger spends the opening half-hour schlepping between unlovely standup venues in a shared car. (His companions are real-life comics <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2013/jul/29/luisa-omielan-destinys-comic\">Luisa Omielan</a> and Richard Sandling.) OK, so he pisses himself on stage, gets booed and pelted with soft fruit. But look at that lovely house! Our hero is clearly punching well above the average standup\u2019s financial weight, which may be due to his day job writing for GQ, here reimagined as COQ \u2013 one of the droller instances of schoolboy humour in a film that\u2019s full of it. (Memo to the film-makers, however: journalism is almost as penny-pinching as club comedy.)</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haHiNmgdb1A\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/haHiNmgdb1A?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Watch the trailer for The Comedian\u2019s Guide to Survival</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Dancing to the whim of a cartoonishly monstrous editor (Paul Kaye), our hero is commissioned to interview famous comedians for the magazine \u2013 which is both degrading and an opportunity to harvest career tips. After offering the usual if-at-first-you-don\u2019t-succeed encouragement, Omid Djalili (playing himself) finally advises Mullinger that \u201cif [failure] happens repeatedly, then life is telling you to stop\u201d. Which sounds like good sense \u2013 but the film disagrees. It\u2019s structured as a series of humiliations for Mullinger, and judges him on his ability to pick himself up, dust himself down and keep \u201cchasing the dream\u201d. This is not a movie that excuses quitters. You earn a career in comedy, it seems, by persisting in the face of evidence that you have no comic talent whatsoever.</p> <p>That\u2019s a flaw in the film, which withholds any sense of even a kernel of comedic talent, as Mullinger lurches from one on-stage indignity to the next. It doesn\u2019t help that Buckley isn\u2019t a standup comedian: it\u2019s all too easy to believe in his ineptitude, but his abilities as a standup are harder to detect. One epiphany comes when Mullinger \u2013 having been robbed and abandoned in the Californian desert \u2013 lets off steam in a far-flung diner, inadvertently amusing fellow customers. Later, his audience bellows with laughter at an impromptu corporate gig in LA. On neither occasion does Buckley\u2019s delivery suggest a comic, although in the latter instance, his duff material (about his father-in-law mistaking dildos for microphones) doesn\u2019t help. (The film\u2019s funniest moments feature real-life comedian <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2013/mar/13/kevin-eldon-bridesmaid\">Kevin Eldon</a>, playing Mullinger\u2019s American chauffeur.)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"812452d7433f4960d6c22e0f3824404bdee3d009\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/812452d7433f4960d6c22e0f3824404bdee3d009/0_96_1536_922/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Living the dream \u2026 Vas Blackwood as Dustin Stratford and James Buckley as James Mullinger.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Living the dream \u2026 Vas Blackwood as Dustin Stratford and James Buckley as James Mullinger.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: FH Studio/GSP Studios/Solar Productions</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This LA trip is at the behest of GQ/COQ \u2013 like the real-life Mullinger, our hero gets his break at Montreal\u2019s Just for Laughs festival while on journalistic duty. It\u2019s fascinating what, throughout this sequence, success in comedy represents to Mullinger: not (just) entertaining people, but the trappings that come with it \u2013 bikini-clad models lounging by swimming pools prominent among them. (In the film, comedy is a conspicuously male activity.) This film couldn\u2019t have been made pre-2000, when comedy wasn\u2019t aspirational; indeed, was seldom considered a career. Now it\u2019s a means of becoming a god, as the final frames demonstrate. Mullinger\u2019s apotheosis isn\u2019t making people laugh, it\u2019s simply standing on a huge stage in front of 6,000 of them. It\u2019s the transcendent feeling of escaping one\u2019s insignificance, of being elevated, gazed at, chosen.</p> <p>Of course, comedy here is a proxy for whatever dream the film\u2019s audience may be chasing. Whether you want to be a comic, or an astrophysicist, or the prime minister, the film\u2019s keep-the-faith message should apply. But Mullinger\u2019s lack of apparent comic flair undermines that optimism, at least as it applies to standup. It prompts the question: is doggedness and self-belief <em>really </em>enough, in the face of the fundamental inability to make people laugh? To what extent can you learn to be a comedian, and to what extent are you born that way? Djalili\u2019s provocation apart, The Comedian\u2019s Guide to Survival has little to say on whether, without the talent to cultivate in the first place, you\u2019ve any chance whatsoever of surviving.</p> <h2>Three to see</h2> <p><strong>Sofie Hagen: Shimmer Shatter</strong><br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7c3122585c5762c1b6540c150166337fcdc6777a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7c3122585c5762c1b6540c150166337fcdc6777a/0_1305_3840_2304/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Shimmer Shatter \u2026 Sofie Hagen.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Shimmer Shatter \u2026 Sofie Hagen.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anders Dahl Tollestrup</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The follow-up to Hagen\u2019s 2015 Edinburgh best newcomer award-winner Bubblewrap, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/aug/08/sofie-hagen-edinburgh-festival-review-shimmer-shatter\">Shimmer Shatter</a> \u2013 now touring \u2013 similarly interweaves stories of anxiety, depression and indignity from the Danish comic\u2019s present and past.

  "<p>With glinting cartridge belts slung across his chest in cavalier fashion, Saifur Rahman once posed for the inevitable macho snapshot reprised countless times by each generation of young men sent off to war. It was an image that made his mother proud. The salary Rahman sent home while serving in the Afghan army\u2019s 207 Zafar Corps enabled his family to eat meat three times a week and send two of his younger brothers to school.</p> <p>Then, on 20 March, the first day of the Afghan new year, Rahman suffered such severe gunshot wounds that he was thrown into the back of a vehicle along with the bodies of colleagues killed in the same ambush.

The Afghan government does not publish casualty figures but, in August, Gen John Nicholson, commander of US and Nato forces in Afghanistan, revealed the Afghan military lost <a href=\"http://www.voanews.com/a/afghan-forces-lost-900-men-in-july-us-commander-says/3487944.html\">more than 900 men in July</a>. Britain lost <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-10629358\">456 personnel</a> in Afghanistan over 15 years. The latest figures suggest Afghan security forces might be on track for an even bloodier year than 2015, when more than <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-afghanistan-casualties-idUSKCN0ZQ04H\">5,000 of their number were killed and 14,000 wounded</a>.</p> <p>The numbers illustrate the brutal price the Afghan army is still paying five years after the high-water mark of western intervention, when a surge of 150,000 troops \u2013 mostly American \u2013 aimed to cripple the insurgency and create conditions for a peace settlement. Instead, with most of the foreign forces gone, the Taliban controls more territory than at any time since it was ousted in 2001 and frontlines have increasingly reached urban areas.</p> <p>Dawlat Waziri, a spokesman for Afghanistan\u2019s defence ministry, said the army provides treatment for wounded soldiers, with those discharged receiving lifelong pensions. </p> <p>\u201cMedical care will be provided throughout their lives, free of charge, and for family members as well,\u201d Waziri said.</p> <p>However, for the relatives of those who suffer life-changing wounds, such promises can ring hollow. Overstretched, distant military hospitals may have little to offer, and the expenses of caring for disabled young men rapidly mount. The impact is being felt by the next generation in terms of lost opportunities for education and livelihood as younger brothers are cast into roles as carers. </p> <p>Abdul Wahid, 21, lost the use of his legs when he was shot this year while climbing down from a watchtower in Helmand province for evening prayers.

Latest figures show an increasing number of people are being scammed by fraudsters taking advantage of a highly competitive rental market.</p> <p>Reports of rental fraud in the UK jumped by around a third in 2015 compared with the previous year, with 2,940 incidents, according to Action Fraud, the national fraud and internet crime reporting centre. In the first nine months of this year 1,891 people reported they had been a victim of rental fraud.</p> <p>In Bavington\u2019s case the fraudster had taken pictures from a legitimate property listing on another site, changing key details to convince her victims. \u201cShe sent a signed tenancy agreement and deposit guarantee letter, adding that I\u2019d get a full refund if I didn\u2019t move into the property \u2013 I decided to take the risk,\u201d she says.</p> <p>The rise in fraud comes at a time when securing appropriate housing is becoming increasingly difficult. \u201cIntense competition for a dwindling number of homes has left thousands of people with little choice over where they live or who they rent from.

Two other properties were listed in the same building, with a landlord who was based in Germany. They made an inquiry and got an email from \u201cAndreas\u201d which included a tenancy agreement and proof of identity. He had also added a link to a Research Gate profile, the professional network for scientists.</p> <p>\u201cWe were told other people were interested who could move in straight away, and some were willing to pay the deposit without viewing,\u201d says Fernandes. \u201cBut \u2018Andreas\u2019 said he preferred us as we wanted a longer tenancy.

For big players in the classified ad space, there may be little they can do to prevent it.\u201d</p> <p>For those who fall victim to an online rental scam, there is little hope of getting their money back. People have been advised to report suspicious adverts to the website if it appears something is not right. Victims\u2019 banks should be contacted as soon as it is feared there has been a fraud, in case the money has not yet left the account.</p> <p>Meanwhile, several websites have emerged which offer services to protect against falling victim to rental fraud. Among them, <a href=\"https://www.rentprofile.co/\">RentProfile</a> provides a searchable database of landlords, and includes identity checks, whether they own the property or have been subject to any housing prosecutions, and reports from previous renters. If there isn\u2019t a record of a particular landlord, tenants can request a landlord check report costing \u00a39.</p> <p>\u201cWhile at university I was the victim of a fake landlord and lost \u00a31,000,\u201d says co-founder David Munday. \u201cI met the landlord who appeared genuine. He had a tenancy agreement and said a bank transfer was fine. On the day I was due to move in he texted to ask for another month\u2019s rent. I didn\u2019t agree to this, and after that I couldn\u2019t get hold of him \u2013 and realised I\u2019d been scammed.\u201d Munday and his brother set up the website after they discovered that this was a common occurrence.</p> <p>Some property advertising websites are also increasing their security. The House Shop, for example, has joined forces with the Land Registry to launch a landlord verification process. Anyone listing something for rent must confirm official details of the property, which is checked against the Land Registry database to confirm ownership.</p> <h2>STAYING SAFE</h2> <p>There are several ways renters can protect themselves from scams:</p> <p>\u25a0 Never hand over any money before viewing a property in person.</p> <p>\u25a0 Ideally, visit the property with the landlord and take somebody with you.</p> <p>\u25a0 Ask lots of questions. An honest landlord should know the answers.</p> <p>\u25a0 Ask the landlord to verify their ID and for any safety certificates such as for gas and electricity.</p> <p>\u25a0 Research the property to check it actually exists.</p> <p>\u25a0 Check the landlord is the legal owner of the property using the Land Registry.</p> <p>\u25a0 Landlords must be part of a registered tenancy deposit scheme. Check which scheme a landlord is registered with.</p> <p>\u25a0 Pay a deposit using a credit card if possible, which will provide some protection. Never hand over cash.</p> <p>\u25a0 Only hand over money when you have seen a written contract and checked it.</p> <p>\u25a0 Shelter offers information on how to check if your deposit is protected.</p> <p>\u25a0 Look for a landlord who is a member of a professional body such as National Landlords Association (NLA).</p> <p>\u25a0 If it seems too good to be true, it probably is, so walk away.</p> <p>For more tips go to <a href=\"http://guides.gumtree.com/property-safety\">guides.gumtree.com/property-safety</a></p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 24 October 2016 to introduce the quotation marks around the word \u201clandlords\u201d in the headline, as initially it did not correctly reflect the story.</p>",

  "<p>I mistakenly expected <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/feb/20/film.jgballard\">David Thomson</a>, the most imaginative and affectionate writer on cinema, to take a dim view of television. After all, the big screen usually treats the small screen with disdain. In Douglas Sirk\u2019s <em>All That Heaven Allows</em>, widowed Jane Wyman is given a TV set by her children: it signals that they expect her to settle on her sofa and sink into meek, housebound obsolescence. Enraged by the fatuous sales pitches that drivel from a set in his motel room, the hero of Wim Wenders\u2019s <em>Alice in the Cities</em> hefts his boot into the box, concusses it and gloats over the charred mess.</p> <p>Thomson, however, understands the futility of such gestures. We can switch the set off, but the medium remains permanently and ubiquitously on; distending to cover the sides of skyscrapers in Times Square or shrinking to fit into our smartphones, it has taken over the world. We may grip a remote control but, Thomson warns, \u201cwe are not in charge\u201d, because \u201ctechnology is less our tool than something that makes tools of us\u201d. Television values us as customers for the wares it sells, or as gloating spectators of deaths it is eager to broadcast live. Its eye, Thomson remarks with a shudder, is \u201cimpatient for terrible action\u201d \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9J9LK430ng\">Jack Ruby shooting Lee Harvey Oswald</a>, Niki Lauda\u2019s car exploding into flames, the Columbia space shuttle disintegrating as it re-entered Earth\u2019s atmosphere.</p> <p>Despite such qualms, Thomson is an immersive, promiscuous viewer. He venerates AJP Taylor, who delivered fluent television lectures on history without relying on notes or an autocue, but he also relishes the slurs and grimaces that are Judge Judy\u2019s versions of the death penalty. He recently devoted 10 studious days to the boxed set of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/breaking-bad\"><em>Breaking Bad</em></a>, yet he sometimes randomly channel surfs, enjoying \u201cthe surreal linkage of alien things in the montage\u201d.</p> <p>As a Londoner transplanted to California, Thomson pays special tribute to the \u201ccomic insurrection\u201d of British television. He marvels at the Hitlerian rants of John Cleese in <em>Fawlty Towers</em>, and believes that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/ricky-gervais\">Ricky Gervais</a>, with his filthy mouth and his equally offensive potbelly, is conducting a one-man campaign against the compulsory niceness and sameness of the American medium.</p> <p>Although this engagingly anecdotal, excitingly speculative survey unfurls as a history, Thomson\u2019s subtitle calls it a biography, perhaps because the dominance of television began around the time when he was born, which gave it, at least in its early years, an authority he describes as \u201cparental\u201d. For Thomson\u2019s generation, growing up in an anxious world after 1945, television served as a communal pacifier. It was a domestic appliance, which assured us that we\u2019d be safe at home. Sitcoms about suburban bliss devised spurious problems that could be solved within half an hour; laugh tracks coaxed us into agreement, while every few minutes commercials touted the brands of deodorant or detergent that would sanitise and sanctify our happy, affluent lives.</p> <p>Thomson applauds <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/aug/14/sarah-kendall-lucille-ball-comedy\">Lucille Ball</a> for laying waste to this suffocating idyll in the frenzied rampages of <em>I Love Lucy</em>. But he also touchingly recalls evenings spent watching <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/friends\"><em>Friends</em></a> with his wife and children, content to share the hearth-like warmth the show exuded. Even in their local coffee shop, the six characters huddled on couches like television viewers, which made it easier for them to slide into those sexless group cuddles that cheered all of us up.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b1814fd0d08fa535e46e3400cae3ada97894ad5c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b1814fd0d08fa535e46e3400cae3ada97894ad5c/0_122_2980_1788/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lucille Ball in I Love Lucy.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lucille Ball in I Love Lucy.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Everett/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>With the passing decades, the prospect inevitably clouds over. As a lad in south London, Thomson watched a blotchy relay of the coronation on a set his gran bought for the occasion; as a middle-aged man in San Francisco, he watched two passenger jets scythe through the World Trade Center towers, and nodded when his six-year-old son \u2013 a true child of the media age, or one of<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allegory_of_the_Cave\"> Plato\u2019s deluded cavemen</a> in juvenile form \u2013 asked: \u201cDad, what movie is this?\u201d</p> <p>Screens once convened a group and unified society, as on coronation day. Now, Thomson argues, they are \u201ca measure of a necessary impacted solitude\u201d. As the space we\u2019re allocated on planes narrows, squeezing us up against our neighbours, we retain a notional privacy thanks to the monitor fitted to the seat in front: the body remains in prison, but our eyes can flicker through a hundred interchangeable in-flight channels. It all concludes \u2013 or else the next stage of our technology-driven evolution begins \u2013 with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/sep/28/vr-isnt-a-thing-you-do-its-a-place-you-visit-readers-review-oculus-rift\">Oculus Rift</a>, displayed in the last of the book\u2019s witty, startling illustrations: a helmet insulates your head and allows you to live in a virtual world. The experience, according to an early adopter, is as hallucinogenic as heroin.</p> <p>When Thomson reaches the present, his gratitude for the affable, sociable medium has to struggle against an elderly pessimism. He comes back repeatedly to the threat posed by Donald Trump, reacting to him sometimes with contempt and sometimes with dread. He calls Trump a \u201cscoundrel madman\u201d created by and for the medium, \u201can inspired, mercurial handler of TV\u201d who \u201ccan go from <em>The Apprentice</em> to being the apprentice\u2019s sorcerer in one blithe insult\u201d. He covets the presidency, Thomson suggests, because it will guarantee him unlimited access to television, especially if he happens to be declaring war.</p> <p>Yes, I can see it now: puffed up to the size of the jumbotrons used in sports stadia, a permatanned face topped by a saffron quiff glares into the camera and tells the entire human race, \u201cYou\u2019re fired!\u201d Then, at last, the soothing, bantering, cornucopian screen will go dark for ever.</p> <p><em>Television: A Biography is published by Thames &amp; Hudson (\u00a319.95). </em><a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/television-447272.html\"><em>Click here to buy it for \u00a316.36</em></a></p>",
  "<p>My entry into the benefits system late in life came as a shock. Like the eponymous hero of Ken Loach\u2019s new film, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/may/12/i-daniel-blake-ken-loachs-welfare-state-polemic-is-blunt-dignified-and-brutally-moving\" title=\"\">I, Daniel Blake</a>, I was in my late 50s. After I was made redundant I discovered that although I\u2019d been paying my national insurance contributions for decades, I still wouldn\u2019t qualify for a full state pension. That\u2019s when I decided to apply for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/mar/01/equalities-watchdog-criticises-planned-cuts-to-work-support-allowance\" title=\"\">employment and support allowance</a>: a benefit for unemployed people of working age who have limited prospects of work because of a disability or health condition. My modest teacher\u2019s pension meant I wouldn\u2019t receive any weekly payments: but, if I could accrue additional NI credits, that would add to the value of my eventual state pension.</p> <p>So in January I rang the Department for Work and Pensions and said I wanted to apply for ESA. I was told that I\u2019d first need to complete a written questionnaire, then, I\u2019d be invited to a medical examination. I was asked how the DWP should communicate with me, as someone who is totally blind. I said that I needed to receive all forms and written communications electronically, and could then read and respond to them using speech software on my computer. A few days later, a print copy of the questionnaire arrived by post.</p> <p>At the heart of the 21-page form were 18 questions, each one aimed at a&#xa0;specific disability and a single challenge associated with that disability. Thus, question eight was titled \u201cproblems with your vision\u201d and asked about the issue of \u201cgetting around\u201d. If I said I couldn\u2019t do something, then I\u2019d earn points towards a score that would decide my eligibility.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2016/jun/15/i-daniel-blake-trailer-ken-loach-palme-dor-winner-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/4y8yp\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2545531\"            data-video-name=\"I, Daniel Blake: the trailer for Ken Loach's Palme d'Or-winner \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57614ca5e4b02af82c1b60fc\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/06/15/160615IDanielBlakeTrailer_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2016/06/15/160615IDanielBlakeTrailer_small.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/06/15/160615IDanielBlakeTrailer.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2016/06/15/160615IDanielBlakeTrailer_large.3gp\"/><source src=\"http://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11596119&amp;format=video/webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2016/jun/15/i-daniel-blake-trailer-ken-loach-palme-dor-winner-video\">I, Daniel Blake: the trailer for Ken Loach\u2019s Palme d\u2019Or-winner</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Elsewhere, there were questions about \u201ccoping with changes\u201d, \u201cawareness of hazards or danger\u201d and learning \u201cto do everyday tasks without difficulty\u201d: all of which apply to someone who is visually impaired. However, I couldn\u2019t earn points for these questions, because they were intended for claimants with a diagnosis of \u201cmental health, cognitive and intellectual problems\u201d. If I wanted those NI credits, I would have to make a good job of answering question eight.</p> <p>The wording was simple enough: \u201cTick this box if you can get around safely on your own.\u201d Immediately I was confused. For decades I\u2019d travelled by tube and train across London. If I thought this was unsafe, presumably I shouldn\u2019t have left the house. I recalled the countless commuters who told me they couldn\u2019t possibly do what I do and others who\u2019d made me feel like a walking health and safety hazard. In a burst of defiance, I wanted to answer: \u201cYes, you bet I can get around safely!\u201d</p> <p>Over a cup of tea, I discussed the problem with my wife. Together, we recalled a few of my near misses: the two occasions I\u2019d gone down the gap between the train and the platform; and&#xa0;other times when I\u2019d fallen down holes in the road or had my head clipped&#xa0;by the mirror of a passing lorry. It wasn\u2019t that I\u2019d forgotten these incidents, but, in the interest of trying to lead a normal life I\u2019d put them to the back of my mind. Slightly crestfallen, I returned to the questionnaire and left the box unticked.</p> <p>I looked through the form for any question that took account of my damaged right hand: I\u2019m missing a thumb, first finger and half of my middle finger, meaning I can\u2019t perform basic tasks such as cutting food. Question five asked: \u201cCan you use either hand to: press a button such as a telephone keypad, turn the pages of a book, pick up a \u00a31 coin, use a pen or pencil, use a suitable keyboard or mouse?\u201d Because I can pick up a coin with my left hand, I wouldn\u2019t get any points for manual dexterity. I thought about all the coins I\u2019d dropped and couldn\u2019t pick up because I couldn\u2019t see where they\u2019d rolled.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/oct/21/meet-the-real-daniel-blakes-ken-loach-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/58fjn\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2826140\"            data-video-name=\"Meet the real Daniel Blakes \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-5809eecde4b005f21833bc43\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/10/21/161021RealLifeDanielBlake_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/10/21/161021RealLifeDanielBlake.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11979151&amp;format=video/webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/oct/21/meet-the-real-daniel-blakes-ken-loach-video\">Meet the real Daniel Blakes</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>One effect of the DWP\u2019s atomised approach to disability is that it doesn\u2019t take account of the cumulative impact of two or more conditions. Thus, according to the form, my hearing loss was negligible, even though, in combination with my visual impairment, it constitutes a serious problem. By the time I\u2019d finished the form, I felt like every ounce of competence and confidence had been drained out of me.</p> <p>In April, nine weeks after my initial application, the DWP invited me to an in-person assessment in four days\u2019 time. I\u2019d been promised I\u2019d be contacted by phone but, once again, I received a letter through the post. The letter warned that failure to attend the assessment could result in withdrawal of benefits. I wondered what would have happened if I\u2019d lived alone and didn\u2019t have someone to regularly check my post.</p> <p>My wife drove me to the assessment centre. It was poorly signposted but eventually she found and rang the buzzer and we were admitted into a bleak stairwell that smelt of disinfectant. Upstairs we found the offices where Maximus, the DWP disability assessment provider, does its business. It was later confirmed to me that the premises are inaccessible to anyone who has difficulty climbing stairs.</p> <p>The receptionist seemed flustered. She wanted me to sign something and, rather than addressing me directly, asked my wife: \u201cCan he sign?\u201d Of course, I get this sort of thing all the time, but shouldn\u2019t someone working front-of-house in a disability assessment&#xa0;centre know better?</p> <p>Sitting in the crowded, unventilated waiting room, I listened as an argument broke out. Newcomers were being turned away because the system was so&#xa0;backed up. One woman was in tears. She screamed she had mental health issues and had travelled 30 miles to attend her appointment.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/sep/11/i-daniel-blake-ken-loach-director-film-movie-benefits-system\">I, Daniel Blake: Ken Loach and the scandal of Britain\u2019s benefits system</a> </p> </aside>  <p>After 70 minutes, my name was called. My assessor explained she was a qualified nurse and led us through a security door into one of the assessment rooms. I was told nothing about the format of the assessment and, throughout the hour-long interview, my assessor began every&#xa0;question with the words \u201cMichael\u201d or \u201cNow Michael\u201d. Far from creating a friendly and relaxed atmosphere, I felt disempowered and patronised.</p> <p>First, I had to re-answer all the questions from the original form. Then I was asked to perform a few physical activities, such as raising my arms above my head, which had nothing to do with my actual disabilities. Next came the hearing test. My assessor stood behind me and said a single word. \u201cNow Michael, what was the word I just said?\u201d I told her the word was \u201cMonday\u201d and, with no more ado, she returned to her desk and clattered something out on her computer. \u201cAre you going to do any more tests on my hearing?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d she replied.</p> <p>I think this caused me to go into a bit of a rant, as my wife touched my arm and I guessed I\u2019d better calm down. My&#xa0;assessor remained perfectly composed, waited a moment to check&#xa0;I\u2019d shut up and resumed her computer-generated script as if nothing had happened.</p> <p>Back on the street, I felt enraged. But I also felt like a tourist exiting benefits land. All I wanted were my NI credits: and, because I\u2019m mentally stable, articulate and persistent, I\u2019d probably succeed. In late July, six months after my application, I finally received a (printed) letter saying I was eligible for ESA.</p> <p>But what about the others sitting in the waiting room for whom a wrong decision might mean genuine hardship, debt, withdrawal of housing benefit, eviction or worse? Theresa May talks about helping to create a welfare state that \u201cworks for everyone\u201d; but what I see, and what Loach depicts in his film, is a system that is designed to frustrate, thwart and discriminate against the <a href=\"https://www.disabilitymatters.org.uk/pluginfile.php/57/mod_page/content/79/Disability%20matters%20Infographic_AW.pdf\" title=\"\">11.6 million disabled Britons</a> it\u2019s supposed to support.</p>",
  "<p>The small Cessna plane banks steeply and J Henry Fair of Charleston, South Carolina, hangs his camera out of the small window to film straight down the chimneys of the Lafarge Tarmac cement plant in Aberthaw, south Wales. <br></p> <p>\u201cMan, look at the gunk coming out of that guy. He\u2019s burning rubber as fuel! That\u2019s really environmental, huh?\u201d he shouts as the 25-knot, force six wind whips off the sea and tosses the light aircraft around. </p> <p>Fair asks the pilot to circle the plant three more times. From a few hundred feet above its great sheds and kilns it is clear that the 100-year-old works burn coal, waste and car tyres to make the cement. The wind takes the wisps of white smoke from the chimneys low over the surrounding farmland and beaches. <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"c1f47069c6adfe084cbc8da33ecac9e227d7caba\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c1f47069c6adfe084cbc8da33ecac9e227d7caba/0_0_2401_3600/667.jpg\" alt=\"Smokestack at a Uskmouth power station\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Smokestack at a Uskmouth power station that burns coal and trees for fuel.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: J Henry Fair</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Fair, who documents pollution and waste in the world\u2019s industrial sites, has come to Britain to conduct an aerial toxic tour of south Wales. </p> <p>Having set off from Swindon in Wiltshire and passed over solar farms, unspoilt valleys, ancient villages and some of the richest farmland in Europe, he approaches over the Bristol Channel. </p> <p>What he sees delights and shocks him. Wales is bathed in a low autumn sunlight revealing a vivid industrial landscape of derelict steel works, demolished factories, old smokestacks, sewage and waste plants, holding tanks, pipelines and chimneys. </p> <p>A few wind turbines rotate, but from 1,700 ft, this bastion of the world\u2019s industrial revolution appears a calm picture of emptiness and past enterprise. Docks with no ships, factories with no workers, derelict plant and chimneys without smoke, he says. </p> <p>\u201cWhat impresses [on] me is the sadness at the disappearance of all those jobs. The industry there has just been shipped overseas,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Instead it is the patterns and vivid colours of the contamination and detritus left by the industrial age which excites him. \u201cI am obsessed by them,\u201d he says, as the Cessna passes over bright green, brown and orange settling ponds, tanks and jet-black coal heaps being flattened by minute yellow machines. </p> <p>Fair calls himself an artist and environmental activist. \u201cI am appalled by the subject I photograph but I love what I see in old industry. I want to know how much mercury or carbon is being emitted from a factory, but I also have the artists\u2019s horror of what I am seeing.\u201d<br></p> <p> \u201cWhat does this do?\u201d he asks as the Cessna passes over the Dow Corning chemical works near Barry.

What about its waste coal ash? Where does all that go?\u201d he asks.</p> <p>Back on the ground, Fair says his environmental images must be both meaningful and beautiful to work. \u201cArt that is beautiful but not meaningful is decoration.

But Ian Forth sees a parallel just before that. \u201cEngland\u2019s Test vs South Africa at Headingley in 1998 bears a spooky resemblance to this match. Chasing 219, South Africa were 185-8, needing 34 runs with two wickets in hand on the fifth morning. It all ended swiftly in front of a huge, success-starved crowd in Leeds. Allan Donald was caught behind off Angus Fraser, then Makhaya Ntini was sawn off by umpire Javed Akhtar, with a decision that Barry Richards described as \u2018yet another that would have missed a second set of stumps\u2019.

Bangladesh need just 33 more runs for their first Test victory against England, and only their eighth in all (against 71 defeats). A couple of lusty blows from Sabbir Rahman, and the odd ball shooting along the deck past Jonny Bairstow, could make that target look tiny. </p> <p>And yet England are still favourites, because Sabbir has only two tailenders for company, and the youngest Test nation is quite old-fashioned when it comes to the tail, and about four of the bowlers are seasoned match-winners who have the scent of victory in their nostrils. It should only take an hour, but cometh the hour, on the whole, cometh the Broad. And Gareth Batty, in his comeback Test, is a five-for waiting to happen, if only he can remind Alistair Cook that he exists. </p> <p>Join us at 5am BST.

  "<p>An appeal judgment will be delivered in a Northern Ireland court on Monday morning over a Belfast bakery that was fined for refusing to make a gay-themed cake.</p> <p>Ashers Bakery is appealing against a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/may/19/northern-ireland-ashers-baking-company-guilty-discrimination-gay-marriage-cake\">Belfast county court ruling in 2015</a> that found it guilty of discriminating against a customer on the grounds of sexual orientation. </p> <p>The firm was ordered to pay \u00a3500 compensation to the local gay rights activist Gareth Lee, whose legal action was backed by the Equality Commission of Northern Ireland.</p> <p>Lee had tried to buy a cake depicting the Sesame Street characters Bert and Ernie below the motto \u201cSupport Gay Marriage\u201d for an event to mark the International Day Against Homophobia. When the company refused to bake the cake, Lee sued.</p> <p>At the original court case in 2015 Lee said Ashers Bakery\u2019s refusal to take his order made him \u201cfeel I\u2019m not worthy, a lesser person and to me that was wrong\u201d.</p> <p>Lee, a volunteer member of the LGBT advocacy group Queer Space, had ordered the cake for a private function in Bangor, County Down, in May 2014.</p> <p>His order came shortly after the Democratic Unionist party used its power of veto in the Northern Ireland assembly to block moves to make gay marriage legal in the province. The region is the only part of the UK where gay marriage is still not recognised in law. </p> <p>The DUP has a strong base in the province\u2019s Evangelical Christian community and was founded out of the late Dr Ian Paisley\u2019s Free Presbyterian Church. The party has consistently blocked proposals in the assembly from other parties including their main partners in government, Sinn F\u00e9in, to legalise gay marriage. </p> <p>During a four-day hearing at the court of appeal in Belfast in May, lawyers for the McArthur family, who own Ashers, said they had challenged the finding because in their eyes it would have been sinful for them to complete the order.</p> <p>In their legal battle to overturn the ruling the McArthur family have won the support of Northern Ireland\u2019s attorney general, John Larkin QC.</p> <p>During the hearing Larkin argued in court that the McArthur family was entitled to constitutional protection for turning down a customer\u2019s order based on their personal religious beliefs. He claimed the case against the bakery was one of \u201ccoerced expression\u201d.</p> <p>He told the court: \u201cThe wrong occurs, and can amount to cruelty, to make someone say something fundamentally at variance with their political opinion or religious views.\u201d</p> <p>The three appeal judges for Monday\u2019s judgment will include Northern Ireland\u2019s lord chief justice, Sir Declan Morgan, and Lord Justices Weatherup and Weir.</p> <p>Daniel McArthur, the general manager of Ashers Baking Company, and his wife Amy will be present outside the court shortly after 9am on Monday as they attend to hear the judgment delivered. </p> <p>Ashers, which employ 80 staff across nine branches in Northern Ireland, has had its legal fees paid by the Christian Institute.</p> <p>At a previous hearing Daniel McArthur explained why his family-run firm turned down Lee\u2019s request for the cake.</p> <p>\u201cWe happily serve everyone but we cannot promote a cause that goes against what the Bible says about marriage. We have tried to be guided in our actions by our Christian beliefs,\u201d he said.</p>",

This is how | Jane McAdam</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Apparently, the only one faithfully toeing the party line on offshore detention is News Corp, which has morphed the issue into yet another of its <a href=\"http://www.heraldsun.com.au/blogs/andrew-bolt/how-abc-stitched-up-nauru/news-story/3f02639207f007184cd64a97ad2b2912\">clunky swipes</a> at the ABC. </p> <p>The ABC broadcast brings front and centre a number of uncertainties, confusions and misconceptions about holding refugees in pitiable Pacific states. </p> <p>These are among the many questions I hear frequently, and here, I hope, is a handy explainer: </p> <p><strong>1. The prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, has claimed that what happens to refugees held on Nauru is the responsibility of the government of Nauru, not of Australia. Is this so? </strong></p> <p>His statement is incorrect. The high court has recognised that Australia has responsibility for the people it detains offshore. The <a href=\"https://jade.io/article/444349\">latest affirmation of this</a> was in February this year in the M68 case. </p> <p>Indeed, the Migration Act says the Australian government can take \u201cany action\u201d in <a href=\"http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ma1958118/s198aha.html\">relation to regional processing</a>. </p> <p><strong>2. Once people have refugee status, can they be held indefinitely on Nauru or Manus Island until a third country taken them? </strong></p> <p>Yes, in practice. No, in theory. </p> <p>The high court has said that detention is lawful as long as it is not indefinite. In other words, detention is supposed to be a condition precedent to \u201cprocessing\u201d so that refugees will move out of detention. The court has indicated that long-term detention without charge or trial would be beyond the power of the parliament as that would trespass on judicial functions. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Australia had failed to protect refugees from \u2018torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment\u2019</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In the meantime, there is a hiatus. Many people have been \u201cprocessed\u201d with the government offering them \u201cpackages\u201d to either go back home, stay in Nauru or PNG, or to a third country that Australian is looking to bribe. </p> <p>Most of the refugees have refused these enticements, as well they might. Voluntarily returning to the place from which you are fleeing doesn\u2019t make much sense, while many of the people of Nauru and PNG are hostile to refugees. </p> <p>Of 551 Manus Island detainees assessed by the PNG government up to 31 May, 2016, 98% have been found to be refugees. Of those, 20 have been resettled in PNG. On Nauru, <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/grattan-on-friday-dutton-should-stop-whinging-and-find-solution-to-the-offshore-problem-64132\">77% of those \u201cprocessed\u201d are refugees</a> and of those five have been resettled in Cambodia under the $55m <a href=\"http://www.law.unsw.edu.au/news/2016/09/australia-cambodia-refugee-relocation-agreement-unique-does-little-improve-protection\">Australia-Cambodia refugee relocation agreement.</a> </p> <p>Signs of resettlement progress have not been visible. It can only be a matter time before the high court finds a case affording it the opportunity to say that detention has the characteristic of being indefinite and thereby unlawful. </p> <p>In the good old days of the <a href=\"http://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_Departments/Parliamentary_Library/pubs/BN/2012-2013/PacificSolution\">Pacific Solution</a> (circa 2001-2008) the following countries admitted refugees who were detained on Nauru and Manus: New Zealand 401, Sweden 21, Canada 16, Denmark 6 and Norway 4. </p> <p>The opposition leader, <a href=\"https://www.laborherald.com.au/people-families/refugee-resettlement-options/\">Bill Shorten, is still banging the drum for the \u201cMalaysia solution\u201d</a> \u2013 even though Malaysia is not a party to the refugee convention. </p> <p><strong>3. Is Australia\u2019s offshore detention processing policy in violation of international law, and if so what can be done about it?</strong></p> <p>Yes, Australia has violated international law. In March 2015 the UN special rapporteur on torture, Juan M\u00e9ndez, reported in relation to Manus Island that the conditions in which detainees were kept amounted to torture under the international convention against torture. </p> <p>Australia is a party to the convention and as such would be required to \u201cprovide adequate detention conditions; end the practice of detention of children; and put a stop to the escalating violence and tension at the regional processing centre\u201d.</p> <p>The report found that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/mar/09/un-reports-australias-immigration-detention-breaches-torture-convention\">Australia had failed to protect refugees </a>from \u201ctorture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment\u201d. </p> <p>The Migration Act and the Maritime Powers Act also allow for the arbitrary detention of people and for their status to be assessed on the high seas without access to lawyers \u2013 both violations of international law.</p> <p>Amnesty International\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/reslib/201610/r1626465_24834993.pdf\">most recent report on Nauru</a> says the indefinite detention of refugees, particularly children, falls foul of the refugee convention. </p> <p>Australia ratified the convention in 1951 and parts of it were incorporated into the Migration Act and as such were enforceable under Australian law. This included the principle of non-refoulement (returning a refugee to a place where their life would be threatened) and the requirement that the minister should grant a protection visa to a non-citizen where protection obligations arise. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It would replace a policy of punitive deterrence with one of decency</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The relevant bits of the refugee convention were removed from the Migration Act in the infamous December 2014 amendments and replaced by a definition of \u201crefugee\u201d narrower than that in the convention.</p> <p>International conventions set \u201cnormative\u201d standards for contracting countries, but individuals cannot enforce those standards unless they are incorporated into Australian law. Nonetheless, <a href=\"http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1995/20.html\">the high court has said in the 1995 case</a> of Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Ah Hin Teoh, that legislation should be interpreted by courts, as far as possible, in a manner consistent with our international obligations. </p> <p><strong>4. Can refugees leave Manus Island and Nauru? </strong></p> <p>In theory, yes. In practice, no. </p> <p>The refugee convention says, \u201cThe contracting states shall not apply to the movements of such refugees restrictions other than those which are necessary and such restrictions shall only be applied until their status in the country is regularised or they obtain admission into another country\u201d.</p> <p>Both Nauru and PNG have signed the convention and Nauru\u2019s temporary protection visas allow refugees to leave and re-enter the country \u2013 as long as they don\u2019t come to Australia. How they might leave, of course, is the problem.</p> <p>Nauru and PNG\u2019s temporary settlement visas also allow refugees to work and receive vocational and language training. PNG also offers a pathway to citizenship, however a large proportion of refugees in this category are too fearful to move into the local communities.</p> <p>In April the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/apr/26/papua-new-guinea-court-rules-detention-asylum-seekers-manus-unconstitutional\">PNG supreme court found the detention of refugees on Manus Island to be unconstitutional</a> and a violation of their rights under the <a href=\"http://www.ohchr.org/en/professionalinterest/pages/ccpr.aspx\">international covenant on civil and political rights</a>. </p> <p>It might be open for a generous benefactor to have large helicopters swoop down onto the offshore camps and remove the refugees. Similarly, a chartered vessel might draw up alongside and spirit them away to another jurisdiction that would offer them more acceptable permanent residency. Of course that would involve violations of airspace and territorial waters but it would be a violation for a noble cause.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/18/peter-dutton-says-he-wont-be-defamed-by-guardian-and-abc-over-nauru-files\">Peter Dutton attacks Guardian and ABC over reporting of Nauru files</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>5. Is there a solution?</strong></p> <p>Yes. The current policy is a failure because Manus and Nauru were only meant to be places of temporary processing. They are now places of indeterminate detention because third-country destinations cannot be found and because the safety of refugees in local communities cannot be assured. </p> <p>A revised policy would have to fulfil the twin objectives of ending the torture and other violations without rekindling the armada of boats. </p> <p>This could be done by onshore (Australian) resettlement of those now held in the offshore facilities and at the same time instituting a program of regional refugee cooperation, focusing on Indonesia and Malaysia.</p> <p>The only reason people get on boats is because they have no hope. If they were given hope of orderly processing and resettlement the boat incentive would disappear. If anyone did get on a boat then they would not be processed or resettled. </p> <p>This would require Australia to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/apr/28/there-are-policy-alternatives-to-locking-up-refugees-in-pacific-gulags\">shift its humanitarian refugee intake</a> from distant camps in South America and the Middle East and focus on the region. </p> <p>It would replace a policy of punitive deterrence with one of decency and put a stop to the hypocritical rhetoric that torture is justified in the name of saving lives at sea. </p>",

  "<p>Everybody has fear,\u201d says Albert Woodfox. \u201cFear is the soul telling the body that it\u2019s in danger. Some people overcome that fear. I overcame it by having a cause. That\u2019s what the party told me: always be honourable, always serve the people.\u201d Woodfox, now a grizzled 69-year-old, has had more reasons to be afraid than most, and when he says that he has known \u201cmore pain and suffering than any human being should be asked to suffer\u201d, he is not exaggerating. At the hands of the American penal and judicial system he has endured wrongful imprisonment and deprivation of basic needs to a degree that seems outlandish in an advanced democracy. Yet his experience is not unique. It is an extreme version of something inflicted on thousands of others, and it is on behalf of these others that, he says, he continues to fight.</p> <p>This February, as he puts it, \u201cI walked through the gates of hell into freedom.\u201d He was released from 45 years incarceration, almost 44 of them in solitary confinement, for most of the time in the Louisiana State Penitentiary, also known as Angola prison. Originally imprisoned for armed robbery, he was later sentenced for the fatal stabbing in 1972 of a prison guard called Brent Miller, a conviction ruled unsafe three times by a federal judge. Together with two other prisoners subjected to decades of solitary, Robert King and Herman Wallace, Woodfox was one of the \u201cAngola Three\u201d, whose treatment provoked <a href=\"http://angola3.org/\">sustained campaigns for their release</a> . Wallace was convicted along with Woodfox for Miller\u2019s murder, King for a separate murder of another prisoner, of which he was eventually cleared.</p> <p>Even had he been guilty of Miller\u2019s murder, decades of solitary confinement would be an exceptionally sadistic punishment, one <a href=\"http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=40097#.WAiWPdfd79I\">defined as \u201ctorture\u201d by the United Nations</a>. Woodfox believes it was inflicted on him because he joined the Black Panthers in prison, the \u201cparty\u201d to which he refers. \u201cI know how many times they offered that if I gave up my party they\u2019d let me out of solitary. Each time I told them, get out of my face.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>From my mom I inherited values and principles that I was able to use: loyalty and devotion, education and discipline</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The phrase \u201csolitary confinement\u201d might suggest total isolation, a blank-walled cell with a lightbulb, food pushed through a slot in the wall, a condition which over any length of time would destroy anyone. Woodfox is at pains to say that in Angola his was not this \u201cHollywood\u201d version but rather 23 hours a day locked into an 9ft by 6ft (2.7 metres by 1.8 metres) cell, barred at one end, in a tier of \u201c14, 15, 16\u201d similar cells. Some communication was possible with neighbours, even if he could not see them, or with other inmates on their way to the showers. The Angola Three made themselves chess sets out of twisted toilet paper and played games by shouting moves to each other. Woodfox would also walk repeatedly up and down his three-yard-long universe in an effort to keep fit.</p> <p>The former attorney general of Louisiana James \u201cBuddy\u201d Caldwell has tried to argue that this wasn\u2019t really solitary at all, on the basis of the limited human contact allowed \u2013 that, rather than being absolutely unsurvivable, it was merely almost so. The United Nations disagrees with his definition and says that no form of solitary confinement should be imposed for more than 15 days \u2013 that is, about a thousandth of Woodfox\u2019s punishment \u2013 after which some of the harmful psychological effects of isolation can become irreversible. CCR, or closed cell restricted, to give the term preferred by the prison system, is incomprehensibly harsh. Some inmates, none of whom suffered it as long as Woodfox did, curled themselves up in foetal positions, others screamed. \u201cThat may seem good,\u201d says Woodfox of the fact he could talk to other prisoners, \u201cbut given the nature of some of these guys driven insane, sometimes it wasn\u2019t.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"d4192956eb15158f36a9d315fc02bb5e4230caf7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d4192956eb15158f36a9d315fc02bb5e4230caf7/0_0_3200_4000/800.jpg\" alt=\"Albert Woodfox, less than 24 hours after his release from the Louisiana State Penitentiary.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Albert Woodfox, less than 24 hours after his release from the Louisiana State Penitentiary.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bryan Tarnowski/New York Times/Redux/Eyevine</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He himself suffered panic attacks \u2013 sweating, a feeling of being smothered that obliged him to sleep sitting up. So he was not unscathed, but with the two other members of the Angola Three \u201ccame to the conclusion that we were going to survive\u201d. They taught themselves criminal law and civil law and committed themselves to fighting for their own and others\u2019 causes. \u201cFrom my mom,\u201d Woodfox also says, \u201cI inherited values and principles that I was able to use: loyalty and devotion, education and discipline. I was able to self-educate, to define who I was.\u201d How did he get the books? \u201cIn prison there\u2019s always a black market system.\u201d</p> <p>The Angola Three would fight for better conditions in the prison \u2013 for example, for access to TV, newspapers and occasional exercise that was initially denied them, and against the degrading way in which their food was pushed into their cell along the ground, under the wall of bars. They used hunger strikes if necessary, \u201cthe most effective but the most brutal way\u201d. They would campaign for their own release and against wider injustices in American society. \u201cWe argued, but we never broke faith,\u201d Woodfox says in <a href=\"http://\"><em>Cruel and Unusual</em></a>, a feature documentary about the Angola Three that will be shown on Channel 4 later this year. \u201cWe could die in prison if that\u2019s what it took. Once you break that spirit, you can\u2019t get it back.\u201d</p> <p>Now he sits in the Washington flat (contemporary in style, greyish-white, subdued) of one of his loyal band of supporters, where he is staying in the brief pause between one public event in the nation\u2019s capital and another in Chicago. He combines an astonishing level of outward calm and peace with a sense of something held in. He is both polite and frank but also seems removed, as his way of dealing with his drastic experiences. Above all, he seems to be maintaining the ferocious self-discipline that kept him sane inside. \u201cI still have claustrophobic attacks, panic attacks,\u201d he says, \u201cI still get angry. I just choose to use my anger as a means for changing things\u201d.</p> <p>He has had the Rip Van Winkle experience of leaving society in one era and re-entering it in another, except that he didn\u2019t find that racial politics in the United States had made as much progress as you might think. It was as if the hair, fashion and music of 1971 were still the same, only in the field of social relations. \u201cSo far,\u201d he says of the state of America before and after his imprisonment, \u201cmy observation is that while there appear to be changes in the country, the changes that did occur are really superficial.\u201d He sees the successes of Donald Trump as evidence: \u201cHe has made racism and bigotry legitimate. He is not going to go away if he loses. It will take another generation to get rid of this kind of garbage.\u201d</p> <p>As far as Woodfox is concerned, he has been grappling with racism all his life, ever since he grew up in New Orleans. He also admits faults of his own. \u201cA lot of people have no idea how African Americans lived in the 60s,\u201d he says. \u201cThe vast majority lived in ghettoes, the majority couldn\u2019t get jobs or else they got worse paid for the same jobs than white people did. I was a petty criminal at one time. It was a way to survive at times of desperation. I wasn\u2019t stealing just to steal, I would steal to bring food into the house. Other than that, it was bullshit things like stealing a car. But I was still a predator on my own people.\u201d</p> <p>Then he was sent to Angola, 140 miles inland from New Orleans, the largest maximum security prison in the US and a place whose notorious horrors have long exercised a special fascination on writers, film-makers and reformers. It occupies a former plantation \u2013 its name refers to the place of origin of its slaves \u2013 and following the civil war was owned by a former Confederate major who ran it along lines very like its former existence. African Americans sent there on often slender pretexts were forced to work its fields for the profit of its owners, in a way barely distinguishable from slavery.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>When society looks the other way, the judicial system becomes judge, jury and executioner</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Despite periodic attempts at reform, a recitative of outrage about Angola sounds through the decades, in magazines, books and newspapers. Its regime was \u201cprobably as close to slavery as any person could come in 1930\u201d. In 1952 it was \u201cthe worst prison in America\u201d. In the 1960s it was \u201cthe bloodiest prison in the south\u201d. In 1971 the American Bar Association said that its conditions were \u201cmedieval, squalid and horrifying\u201d. \u201cEvery week,\u201d says Woodfox, \u201csomeone there was killed or seriously injured.\u201d \u201cI know guys in Angola\u201d, he also says, \u201cwho have been there 40 years for having a bag of dope.\u201d In this telling, given that prisoners still work in its farms and factories for minimal pay, 200-year-old habits are dying hard.</p> <p>Woodfox states his innocence of the armed robbery charge that had him sent to Angola: \u201cI lent my car to my friend and he was involved in a shoot-out with the police.\u201d Inside the prison, he started protesting for better conditions. He joined the Black Panthers, the revolutionary black nationalist movement that had reached the peak of its fame and influence in the late 1960s. Woodfox had encountered them in New York while on the run from imprisonment, and been inspired by the confidence and empowerment, until then unfamiliar to him, with which he saw the party\u2019s young black men speak. In Angola he followed the Panthers\u2019 model of self-defence: \u201cWe were organising against racism and against corruption.\u201d They fought, for example, the appropriation by security staff of food and clothing meant for prisoners.</p> <p>He helped start \u201canti-rape squads\u201d. \u201cEvery Thursday \u2013 you call it Fresh Fish Day \u2013 when new arrivals come by bus and get assigned to various camps. Guys would gang up on them, trick them into accepting gifts and then demand payment, which they can\u2019t pay. So they\u2019d say \u2018you\u2019ve got to be my gal-boy\u2019. They\u2019d make them into prostitutes, rent them out.\u201d Sometimes \u201cit would be two or three guys on one man\u201d. Sometimes victims would die as a result of their assaults. Woodfox says that the guards knew about it, but they were paid off.</p> <p>He and his allies would \u201clook for first-timers when they got off the bus and try and educate them.\u201d He says they were \u201cloved and respected\u201d by other inmates, but \u201cthe predators hated our guts\u201d. The anti-rape squads were threatened with weapons. \u201cThey said \u2018it\u2019s not your business\u2019. We said \u2018we\u2019re making it our business\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>Then Brent Miller, 23 years old and married for two months to 17-year-old Teenie, was killed, stabbed 38 times with a knife and a sharpened lawnmower blade. \u201cI never met him, I never talked with him,\u201d says Woodfox. \u201cI was in the dining hall eating breakfast.\u201d He had witnesses to back him up. The prosecution\u2019s chief witness was Hezekiah Brown, a serial rapist serving life without parole, who was described as a \u201cprofessional snitch\u201d by a fellow inmate and of whom a deputy warden of the prison would say \u201cHezekiah was one you could put words into his mouth\u201d. Having first said that he did not witness the crime, he was offered privileges, luxuries such as cigarettes and ultimately freedom <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=96255685\">to testify against Woodfox and Wallace</a>. He was <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=96199165\">threatened with solitary if he did not</a>.</p> <p>Bloody fingerprints at the scene of the crime matched neither of the accused\u2019s and no effort was made to find out whose they were, out of the limited pool of prisoners. Later, during the protracted appeals against their convictions, DNA evidence that might have exonerated Woodfox and Wallace went missing. Among those unconvinced by the evidence would be Miller\u2019s widow, Teenie. \u201cBrent was my whole life,\u201d she later said, \u201che was witty, handsome and talented. He sang and played the drums. He was an all-round good soul.\u201d But she became \u201cvery, very angry\u201d that, <a href=\"https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2014/03/wife-murdered- prison- guard-urges- justice-man- placed-solitary- years-ago/\">in her view, the wrong men were convicted</a>.</p> <p>Woodfox and Wallace were tried separately in the court house in St Francisville, which, as the place where many of the penitentiary\u2019s large staff live, is almost a company town. All-white juries, who had not been told of Brown\u2019s incentives, found them guilty. Woodfox and Wallace were put in solitary, in principle a short-term disciplinary measure. It has to be renewed after 90 days, which it was, again and again, until the days turned into years and decades. \u201cThey were saying we were physically dangerous to ourselves or others,\u201d says Woodfox, \u201cthey didn\u2019t let us out because of our reputation, that the young would copy us\u2026 bullsh-i-i-i-i-t.\u201d During this time, to fast-forward more than half a lifetime of legal agonies, dragged out by the authorities to a barely credible degree, the following landmark dates stand out.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/12/chelsea-manning-solitary-confinement-suicide-attempt-military\">Chelsea Manning emerges from solitary confinement after suicide attempt</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In 1992 Woodfox\u2019s conviction was overturned. In 1993 he was indicted again and for some reason he had to wait until 1998 before a retrial, at which point he was convicted again. The jury\u2019s forewoman at the time of the reindictment was Anne Butler, formerly married to a former Angola warden, Murray Henderson, and author of a book in which she stated her belief in the guilt of the accused. Even she, it was reported, <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=96199165\">wondered why she was allowed on the jury</a>.</p> <p>Woodfox\u2019s second conviction was overturned in 2008 by James J Brady, senior federal judge for the Middle District of Louisiana, and then reinstated in 2010 by a higher court, the Fifth Circuit. It was overturned again in 2013, a decision upheld in 2014 by the Fifth Circuit. In 2015 the state indicted Woodfox for the third time after which Judge Brady issued a rare writ banning a retrial, on the basis that the state were unlikely to give him a fair trial, that key witnesses were all dead and that Woodfox\u2019s age and health meant that he too might die before the process was concluded. The state appealed and in November 2015 the Fifth <a href=\"http://www.theadvocate.com/baton_rouge/news/article_05fbfe11-86e8-5aab-8d7e-f15fad6f8e23.html\">found Brady\u2019s writ excessive</a>, a judgment then appealed by Woodfox.</p> <p>Early this year, on the advice of his lawyers and in order to end the interminable legal struggle, he reached an agreement with the state whereby he pleaded no contest to its charges and was released on his birthday, 19 February. This wasn\u2019t easy. \u201cThe internal struggle for me was,\u201d he recently said, \u201cI had spent 43 years of my life never backing down, never compromising what I believe in.\u201d But \u201csomehow my daughter and my grandkids and great grandkids coming to visit gave me the strength to say, \u2018Yeah, you\u2019re not compromising on anything. It\u2019s not a plea of guilt. This is a plea for freedom.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Meanwhile, in 2001, Robert King\u2019s conviction was overturned and he was released. Herman Wallace had his conviction overturned in 2013 but, even though he was in the final stages of liver cancer, the prison still prevaricated about his release. Only under the threat of being charged with contempt of court did they let him out. He was reindicted by the state two days later. The day after that he died.</p> <p>During this time the Angola Three became famous for the injustice of their cases and the cruelty to which they were subjected. Their story became the centre of the ongoing campaign to end solitary confinement and the International Coalition to Free the Angola Three was created. The founder of The Body Shop, Anita Roddick, championed their cause and her husband Gordon continued to do so after her death.</p> <p>The Angola Three endured, day after day, the extreme deprivations and arbitrary humiliations of CCR. Woodfox\u2019s mother and sister died while he was inside, and he was banned from attending their funerals. His brother Michael survives, and visited every month even when displaced by Hurricane Katrina \u2013 even when it required a five- or six-hour drive for the two hours\u2019 visiting time permitted by the prison.</p> <p>The Angola Three were subjected to routine strip and anal cavity searches, sometimes six times a day, until in 1978, their lawsuit to have them restricted was successful. In 2013 the searches started on Woodfox again, requiring another court order that was then appealed by the state. I ask if there were exceptions to what appears to be a story of unmitigated official brutality. \u201cThere are exceptions, people who are able to hold on to their humanity, who are able to avoid the <em>Robocop</em> syndrome. But absolute power corrupts. Prison guards have absolute power because they realise they can do pretty much what they want.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"020bbddd84310f078b437d4d12c76f93aac09d5b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/020bbddd84310f078b437d4d12c76f93aac09d5b/0_251_2396_1437/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Albert Woodfox leaves prison with his brother Michel Mable, who visited him every month.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Albert Woodfox leaves prison with his brother Michel Mable, who visited him every month.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Billy Sothern/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In Angola, he also says, \u201cyou have families that go back generations. They graduate from high school and a week later, they work in Angola. It keeps a tradition going. They become part of the system. Who knows how long it\u2019s been going on?\u201d</p> <p>Of course, those responsible for the Angola Three\u2019s confinement see things differently. One is the devout Southern Baptist Burl Cain, who was warden of Angola from 1992 until he stood down on 1 January this year, under allegations that <a href=\"http://www.theadvocate.com/baton_rouge/news/politics/article_d6826c2e-136d-5a19-a62d-fcf3383887e6.html\">he inappropriately entered into business deals with relatives of inmates</a>. Described by <em>The Economist</em> as <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/blogs/democracyinamerica/2016/01/story-cain\">\u201ca rockstar of the correctional world\u201d</a>, he won fame and praise for reducing Angola\u2019s rates of violence. In his words, he \u201ctransformed this place from a facility of violence and despair to one of peace and morality\u201d, a task he set about with what one prisoner called \u201ca Bible in one hand and a sword in the other\u201d or what the Baptist Press called <a href=\"http://www.bpnews.net/46003/angola-warden-burl-cain-slates-jan-1-retirement\">\u201ca firm hand and a strong love for Jesus.\u201d</a></p> <aside class=\"element element-membership\"> <p> <span>Membership Event: </span><a href=\"https://membership.theguardian.com/event/life-in-solitary-confinement-the-story-of-the-angola-3-28047089600\">Life in solitary confinement: the story of the Angola 3</a> </p> </aside>  <p><a href=\"http://louisianajusticeinstitute.blogspot.co.uk/2012/01/angola-warden-burl-cain-on-black.html\">Interviewed in 2008 by Woodfox\u2019s attorney Nick Trenticosta</a>, Cain cited a 1973 letter in which the prisoner called violent revolution \u201ca highly necessary occurrence in life\u201d. Trenticosta asked if the passage of time, years of good behaviour and the overturning of his second conviction counted for anything. \u201cHe\u2019s just good because he is locked in CCR,\u201d said Cain, \u201cnot because he\u2019s good at heart\u2026 Because the lion in a cage can\u2019t cause much trouble, you see.\u201d Trenticosta asked Cain to assume \u201cif you can\u201d that Woodfox was innocent of Miller\u2019s killing. \u201cI would still keep him in CCR. I still know that he is still trying to practise Black Pantherism, and I still would not want him walking around my prison, because he would organise the young new inmates.\u201d</p> <p>The most persistent adversary of the Angola Three is <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2009/03/36-years-solitude\">Buddy Caldwell</a>, attorney general of Louisiana until he was voted out last year amid accusations of what his opponent called <a href=\"http://www.nola.com/politics/index.ssf/2015/10/incumbent_caldwell_under_ attac.html\">\u201ccronyism, nepotism and corruption\u201d</a>. It was under his direction that the state fought so hard to keep Woodfox in prison, where he would probably still be today if Caldwell were still in office. \u201cThis is the most dangerous person on the planet,\u201d Caldwell has said, and \u201cI oppose letting him out with every fibre of my being.\u201d He has stated his complete faith in the process that led to Woodfox and Wallace\u2019s convictions and has praised Hezekiah Brown\u2019s courage for testifying in the face of possible intimidation.</p> <p>Miller\u2019s siblings, unlike his widow, believe in Woodfox and Wallace\u2019s guilt and opposed his release. There is also a website, the <a href=\"http://www.odmp.org/officer/9311-corrections- sergeant-brent- miller angola\">Officer Down Memorial Page</a>, which remembers \u201call of law enforcement\u2019s heroes\u201d: it simply states, without reference to the vacated convictions, that he was killed by members of the Black Panthers, \u201ca racist, radical group that professed the murders of law enforcement officers\u201d. But Woodfox and Wallace\u2019s accusers have failed, over decades of legal scrutiny, to make their case without glaring flaws.</p> <p>Central to the case of the Angola Three are the fears and emotions that the Black Panthers still arouse, 50 years after their founding and more than 30 years after they faded away in the early 80s. J Edgar Hoover called them \u201cthe greatest threat to the internal security of the country\u201d and, as is now known, set about destabilising them, getting its leaders locked up and, if desired, killed. In this context, where someone like Woodfox is deemed a threat to the future of the US, the attitudes and practices of someone like Cain become, though not justifiable, explicable.</p> <p>It is also is a matter of record that Black Panthers advocated violence and expressed sympathy for the likes of Stalin, Mao Zedong and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jun/19/black-panthers-north-korea-us-imperialism\">the regime of North Korea</a>. As well as fighting flagrant injustice and founding free food and health programmes for the poor, some of its factions resorted to criminal gangsterism and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/oct/18/black-powers-coolest-radicals-black-panthers-vanguard-of-the-revolution-stanley-nelson-interview\">included murder, torture and rape among their methods</a>. Now that Woodfox is free and dedicated to campaigning, I ask him if he means to do this by legal and democratic means. \u201cThat\u2019s the culture and tradition of America,\u201d he answers. Of the letter cited by Cain, he says that he wasn\u2019t \u201cadvocating revolution, just explaining what it would entail\u201d.</p> <p>But he is not going to disavow the party, and the day before our interview he shared a platform in a Washington convention centre with Bobby Seale, who with Huey Newton founded the Panthers. Rather, he sees campaigns like Black Lives Matter, with which he is involved, as \u201can extension of what the Black Panther Party was\u201d. They want \u201cwhat our ancestors have always been asking for, just to be equal\u201d. To achieve this \u201cwe have to do something different, because we are too predictable. We\u2019re not even allowed the right to resist. If we do, we\u2019re criminals.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2016/apr/27/6x9-a-virtual-experience-of-solitary-confinement\">6\u00d79: A virtual experience of solitary confinement</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It was, he says, \u201cso disappointing when I got out to find that conditions when I left 45 years ago are still here. With the first black president, everyone thought we had reached a milestone, but it just looked different.\u201d If, he continues \u201cAmerica has nothing else to thank Donald Trump for, it is to show that racism is very much alive. He didn\u2019t come out of nowhere. I thought the battle would be economic, not sick-assed philosophy about racism 45 years later.\u201d</p> <p>And so he is travelling and speaking, jetting from one American city to another to speak of his experiences and to fight, along with Robert King, for \u201cthe abolishment of solitary confinement and freedom for political prisoners\u201d \u2013 and political prisoners is what he believes many of those incarcerated in America to be \u2013 \u201cwho remain victims of the criminal injustice system in the USA.\u201d Apart from his fugitive trip to New York, he had never been out of Louisiana until this year, but now he travels from coast to coast and north to south, and is coming to Britain next month for a multi-city tour. All this from a man who came out of jail with hepatitis C, diabetes, renal failure and hypertension. His health has improved dramatically in the months of his freedom, partly due to receiving treatments denied him inside.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re trying to get some kind of civil oversight,\u201d he says, \u201cto hold the administration accountable. When society looks the other way then the judicial system, from police to the courts to the prisons, becomes judge, jury and executioner.\u201d The treatment of people like himself \u201cis more than a legal issue, it\u2019s a moral issue. It\u2019s no different to what they do in other countries that we call dictatorships. We just have a more sophisticated way of doing it.\u201d</p> <p>He gets support from the people who campaigned for his release, from fellow activists, and especially from his brother \u2013 \u201cmy rock\u201d \u2013 who is all that is left of the family he grew up with. But in general he likes to downplay the drama of his transition and to stress that, through continuing the activism that he started inside prison, his move to life outside was made easier. \u201cThere\u2019s some residue, but it doesn\u2019t dominate my life. I was not connected to the prison system. I did not have to break a lot of ties to the prison culture. I was already free in my mind. There was more like a physical adjustment. I had to learn to live beyond a 9ft cell.\u201d Has he even had a holiday since his release in February? \u201cI went to Yosemite. I read a lot of <em>National Geographic</em> in prison and I had a lifetime desire to go there. It was overwhelming.\u201d</p> <h2><br></h2> <h2>The European Freedom Tour: see Albert Woodfox talk</h2> <p>Albert Woodfox and his fellow surviving member of the Angola Three, Robert King, will visit the UK and France next month, kicking off on 1 November with the launch of Amnesty UK\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.amnesty.org/en/get-involved/write-for-rights/\">Write for Rights</a> campaign.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0083fc499a5886ae8fe817c3d309bf9afe7bceb7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0083fc499a5886ae8fe817c3d309bf9afe7bceb7/1973_287_4171_2502/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Albert Woodfox is greeted by Robert King during Woodfox\u2019s first post-release appearance in New Orleans, February 2016.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Albert Woodfox is greeted by Robert King during Woodfox\u2019s first post-release appearance in New Orleans, February 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Max Becherer/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Thursday 3 November, Liverpool</strong><br>John Foster Building, John Moores University, 80-98 Mount Pleasant, L3 5UZ, 5.30pm. <a href=\"https://www.ljmu.ac.uk/about-us/events/ccse-angola-3\">Click here to reserve your free place.</a> </p> <p><strong>Friday 4 November, Manchester</strong><br>Brooks Building, Faculty of Education, Metropolitan University, 53 Bonsall St, M15 6GX, 5.30pm. <a href=\"http://www.eventbrite.com/e/black-power-and-the-struggle-for-freedom-the-story-of-the-angola-3-tickets-28650793294\">Click here to reserve your free place.</a></p> <p><strong>Monday 7 November, London (Guardian event)</strong><br>Simon Hattenstone talks to Albert Woodfox and Robert King on the eve of the US election.

  "<p>A few years ago I lived in a country town of some 3,000 people that had four award-winning restaurants and at least a dozen coffee shops but nowhere to buy light bulbs or milk after midday on a Saturday.</p> <p>The town proudly boasted it didn\u2019t have McDonald\u2019s or pokie machines, but in the locals\u2019 pub (a place that seemed deliberately ugly in order to repel the yuppie couples who come down for long weekends) they would complain that they had to drive 30km to get their KFC fix.</p> <p>The locals \u2013 those who count their residence in a town by the generations not the years \u2013 aren\u2019t always happy that there are multiple restaurants that offer degustation menus. They would rather an Aldi or a McDonald\u2019s than pay $100 to eat teeny-tiny carrots on a dehydrated piece of woodland mushroom.</p> <p>But it\u2019s not just the restaurants. The gentrifiers are pushing house prices up so that the young people who grew up in the town can\u2019t afford to live there. Good coffee is no consolation.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/06/hipster-aesthetic-taking-over-world\">Same old, same old. How the hipster aesthetic is taking over the world</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There are at least a dozen culture wars being fought in Australia at any one time, but the ground-level skirmishes \u2013 where it gets personal \u2013 are those being fought in areas that are being gentrified.<br></p> <p>Australia\u2019s cute country towns \u2013 many within cooee of the city \u2013 are the battlegrounds. We all know the ones. The towns filled with stone cottages and historic courthouses and the facade of a blacksmith\u2019s workshop. These towns languish for decades, undisturbed by development as the main industries slowly die.</p> <p>The rot sets in. But then people come in from the city \u2013 driven out by high prices in Melbourne and Sydney, or seeking a weekender. They are thrilled to discover these divine, intact little villages where, say, an 1860s miner\u2019s cottage with an established garden can be bought for the price of one of those coffin-like apartments in the city.</p> <p>The gentrifiers bring energy to the regions \u2013 and more importantly \u2013 money. But the money comes with strings attached.</p> <p>And as has been proven time and time again, those who control the economy control the values and culture of a place \u2013 or at least its aesthetics.</p> <p>The dominant aesthetic of the gentrifying class might be described as neoliberalism through a dreamcatcher \u2013 yoga classes instead of football clubs, cool cafes instead of Domino\u2019s pizza, homewares shops instead of the Reject Shop.</p> <p>This specific aesthetic and value system signifies class and \u201ctaste\u201d \u2013 and so for example might deem fast food as bad, and veganism as good. Or farmers\u2019 markets as great but commercial supermarkets as a scourge.</p> <p>So what does gentrification look like on the ground in our country towns?</p> <h2>Shops selling beautiful, useless stuff</h2> <p>You cannot buy a pair of socks or a spanner in your town, but there are four shops in the main street selling $120 throw cushions. The shops are often housed in the facade of old shops. So you can go into a shop called General Store where only very specific items are sold \u2013 like leather ottomans. And leather ottomans only.</p> <h2>Unusual yoga classes</h2> <p>Your village not only offers hot yoga, but niche offerings such as yoga accompanied by intuitive harp or yoga classes that only play the music of Tupac Shakur.</p> <h2>Newspapers</h2> <p>The local newspaper has folded. But in good news, the newsagent air freights Vanity Fair and stocks the Saturday Paper.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/13/hipsters-artists-gentrifying-capitalism\">Hipsters and artists are the gentrifying foot soldiers of capitalism | Stephen Pritchard</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>When the meat in sausage rolls changes</h2> <p>At the bakery a $3 pie used to be delicious \u2013 but take off the lid and the meat is a sort of grey paste. Now the bakery has shut down, replaced by a shop selling similar products but at a 300% markup. The good news? In pies the meat is now recognisable as meat. In addition to real meat, the pies now also contain tofu, pumpkin and tarragon, while the sausage rolls come in flavours such as spring lamb and rosemary.</p> <h2>Performative farming</h2> <p>There are no real farmers anymore but a load of people walking around dressed as farmers, in flannel, beards with hay in them, cardigans and work boots. Highly prized is ownership of pre-industrial farming machinery \u2013 like scythes. These pretend farmers can often be found at farmers\u2019 markets drinking turmeric lattes.</p> <p>The gentrifiers often move to the country not because of cheap houses (they would not be so gauche as to admit to that) but because the extra space means they can plant their own vegetable garden. The gentrifiers Facebook and Instagram their vege patch the way others document the growth of their children.</p>"
