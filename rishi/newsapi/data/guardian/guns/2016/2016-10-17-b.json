  "<p> If September, with its focus on football finals across the country is the best sporting month of the year, then for me, October is not far behind. It is the month when those of us who follow American sport \u2013 granted, those of us with a Foxtel subscription \u2013 can flick on to ESPN and gorge on regular season NFL or post-season baseball every day of the week.</p> <p> Who needs spring racing? And while the AFL trade period is compulsive, pressing the refresh button to update your #afltrade hashtag every 30 seconds has its limitations. It seems that these days, everyone in Australia is on the NFL bandwagon. Fantasy football competitions abound everywhere. Check the Instagram feed of your favourite footy player in the next few weeks and chances are they\u2019ll be snapped at an NFL game somewhere as they enjoy their off-season.</p> <p>I\u2019m a diehard New York Giants fan and between various ESPN and NFL apps, a New York Times subscription, all sorts of beat writer Twitter follows and the best of Mike Francesa\u2019s daily WFAN show on my podcast feed, these days I can be as informed and opinionated on the G-Men as \u201cVinny from Queens\u201d and other regular callers to Francesa\u2019s New York radio show. That\u2019s when Odell Beckham Jnr isn\u2019t throwing throwing another tantrum while watching NFL Redzone.</p> <p> But it wasn\u2019t always like that. Having as much American sport as I want to consume right at my fingertips is great, but I can remember the dark old days when it was only at the discretion of newspaper sports sub-editors that Australians might find out the NFL scores at all.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2016/oct/17/nick-kyrgios-atp-ban-learn-talent\">Nick Kyrgios has time on his side to learn he should not waste his talent | Jacob Steinberg</a> </p> </aside>  <p> I started following the NFL and the Giants in 1981 and for the next 10 years, TV coverage of the NFL in Australia was spotty at best. Back then, the NFL had a small, cult following. You might get one game a week at some ungodly hour, often on a delay of up to a week.</p> <p> If the aforementioned newspaper subs chose not to run the scores, then you would tape then watch whichever game was on, taking note of the in-game progress scores at the bottom of the screen and hoping like hell that they would give the full scores from all the other games at the end of the broadcast.</p> <p> Channel Nine was an early adopter of the NFL, right as its Wide World of Sports brand started to gather momentum. They showed a few live games of the playoffs following the 1981 season, including the famous Joe Montana-to-Dwight Clark touchdown that became known as \u201cThe Catch\u201d as the 49ers beat the Dallas Cowboys in the NFC Championship Game.</p> <p> As an aside, I recently discovered that this was the final football game ever called by <a href=\"https://theringer.com/meet-vinnie-from-brooklyn-e70c75087865#.wmfbk6qwd\">the broadcasting great Vin Scully</a>, who just retired as Los Angeles Dodgers baseball broadcaster after a 65-year run. He chose to stick to the summer game after being overlooked by CBS for Pat Summerall for the main NFL gig of working alongside John Madden.</p> <p> Nine showed Monday Night Football in 1984, which also happened to be the last season that Howard Cosell was the lead broadcaster, giving Australians a belated experience of his outsized personality. He was every bit as colourful as advertised.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0cd98be19c89ebd413023babf951c11986330427\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0cd98be19c89ebd413023babf951c11986330427/25_13_998_599/500.jpg\" alt=\"Howard Cosell staring into the distance\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Australian fans of the NFL got their fill of legendary sports broadcaster Howard Cosell (right) in 1984.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bob Riha Jr/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Australian TV coverage was nomadic from there. After that first run of Nine\u2019s, Channel Ten showed a weekly game for a few years, hosted by a clearly-disinterested David Fordham. Fordham is known one of the great blokes of Australian sportscasting, but clearly he didn\u2019t regard fronting an NFL show for a few desperates like me as a career highlight, and it showed.</p> <p>A typical week of NFL fandom for Australians back then: I remember the Giants playing a big game in Los Angeles against the Raiders. The papers hadn\u2019t published the scores that Tuesday morning, so it took me the best part of a week to work my way through the three-plus hours to watch the game and find out eventually that yes, the Giants had won.</p> <p> That was the other thing about watching (and recording) the NFL in the bad, old days. The games would be on late at night and would usually start well after they were advertised, meaning the three-hour VHS tapes would often run out before games were finished. I\u2019m sure the 240-minute VHS cassette was invented for the NFL. </p> <p> The turning point for Australia-based NFL fans came in 1990 when every Monday night at 9.30pm, we would tune in to the ABC and an icon of Australian TV would utter these immortal words, \u201cHi, I\u2019m Don Lane\u2026and thiiiiis is NFL American Football!\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ulEOl3L6xMc\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ulEOl3L6xMc?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Australian broadcaster Don Lane introduces a decidedly off-Broadway American football encounter.</figcaption> </figure>   <p> Actually, the ABC had held the TV rights for a few years before then, but their presenters also hadn\u2019t shown all that much interest, either. Perhaps old mate \u201cFordo\u201d had had a word to them. But then in an inspired choice, they turned to Lane, born in New York as Morton Isaacson and himself a big Giants fan.</p> <p> The popular former late-night TV talk show host brought a new audience to the NFL in Australia. He knew the game, understood its history and genuinely enjoyed presenting the weekly broadcast. Yes, the games were a week old before we saw them, and he would regularly beseech us not to check the scores beforehand, but it was great to finally have a TV host who loved the game as much as we did, and shared our enthusiasm.</p> <p> If there ever was a catalyst for kickstarting interest in the NFL in Australia, it was Don Lane.</p> <p> The ABC held the rights until the mid 1990s and even sent Lane to a few Super Bowls, but by then pay-TV was starting to take off in Australia and live NFL games were a no-brainer for the heads of programming at these fledgling broadcasters.</p> <p> Once ESPN was available, first on Optus Vision and then through Foxtel\u2019s first incarnation Galaxy, we NFL devotees were in heaven. It wasn\u2019t just the games, but hours and hours of Sportscenter, NFL Primetime and the best of NFL Films that we could devour. We\u2019ve since watched on as support for and interest in the game has grown every year since.</p> <p> But it was one thing to watch the game. It was another to try to learn and read about it. Back in the dark, old days there was a paucity of NFL information and reading material available to Australians.</p> <p> The Melbourne High School library subscribed to Sports Illustrated when I went there, and would devour every issue. If the school librarians want to know why a few copies went missing from 1980 to 1983 I am finally prepared to confess, more than 30 years later, that I might be a \u201cperson of interest\u201d.</p> <p> You could also subscribe to The Sporting News, the sports weekly that was known as the \u201cBible of Baseball\u201d and not too bad on the NFL too. But again, it came by boat so you were reading box scores, game reports and features related to matches that were played up to three months beforehand. It was great for college football and major events like the NFL Draft, which had no visibility in Australia whatsoever.</p> <p>The International Herald-Tribune and USA Today were godsend for a time in the late 1980s. In Melbourne, air-freighted editions of both would sometimes lob at the iconic, now-gone McGills newsagency in the city and USA Today also had a phone service you could call to get the scores. Pre-internet, it was the best thing going, but it was expensive. If you were still living at home, you knew the experience of being read the riot act by parents when these calls started appearing on the phone bill.</p> <p> What those papers and magazines also did was expose Australians to some of the great American sportswriting. The words of Rick Reilly, Dan Jenkins, Tony Kornheiser, Dave Kindred, Leigh Montville and the great Frank Deford would leap off the page. Some of us decided we wanted to be try and be like them.</p> <p> When I joined The Age as a cadet journalist in 1990 and moved closer to my goal of becoming a footy writer, my first day on the job was the same day as Super Bowl XXIV (49ers 55, Broncos 10) ) and it was hard to concentrate on the editor\u2019s \u201cWelcome to The Age\u201d pep-talk when he had the game going on his TV screen behind him in the office.</p> <p> But there I learned a few of the reasons why the NFL got such a dreadful run in The Age sports section. Basically, the sports subs (who controlled what got in and out of the sports results section) were a bunch of cranky old Anglophiles. British football, county cricket and even the Williamstown croquet results would get a run before the before the NFL scores and standings. That one of them was known to all on the desk as \u201cWest Ham\u2019\u2019 should tell you all you need to know about where their sporting loyalties lay.</p> <p> Once when I mentioned that an important NFL game had been played and they really ought to run a wire story about it, they relented. But only after rigidly enforcing the house style book and converting every measurement to metric. \u201cA 38.6-metre pass from Troy Aikman to Michael Irvin with seven seconds left gave the Dallas Cowboys a 34-27 win over the Philadelphia Eagles\u2026Emmitt Smith ran for 194.7 metres.\u201d</p> <p> By that stage I was only looking out for a small, but growing number of NFL tragics. Working at the newspaper gave me access all sorts of realtime NFL information \u2013 not just scores but thanks to access to various wire services there were match reports, news stories, injury updates and features from the major US newspapers. As a Giants fan, I was in heaven with all the local coverage at my disposal and I became a fan of the work of Washington Post star columnists Kornheiser and Michael Wilbon years before PTI was even dreamed up.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f41a7feefcfe78ec390f0738388e55def9386ac8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f41a7feefcfe78ec390f0738388e55def9386ac8/0_65_1024_614/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tony Kornheiser and Michael Wilbon appearing on a TV panel show\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Long before they starred in ESPN\u2019 talk show PRI, Tony Kornheiser and Michael Wilbon were only known to a small number of Australians through their Washington Post sports columns.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Randy Holmes/ABC via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p> Before the leaving work for the day, I would stand over the printer, so I could take home all manner of stories, and for a time there I thought I knew as much as about the NFL as anyone in Australia. I rarely came across anyone who cared for it as deeply as I did.</p> <p> In hindsight, I\u2019m sure I was wrong about that and when you fast forward to 2016, it couldn\u2019t be further from the truth. I work with a guy who knows not only the depth chart of his beloved Cleveland Browns from player 1 through 53, but almost all the other 31 teams in the NFL as well.</p> <p> I play in a fantasy football league at work and I stink at it, because my opponents follow the game more closely than I do. Super Bowl Monday as it is here, has seemingly become a defacto public holiday for a certain type of Australian sports fan aged 18-55. NFL is more or less a mainstream sport in Australia these days and even casual sports fans know plenty about Tom Brady, JJ Watt, OBJ and Cam Newton. The dabs of Newton and the deeds of Bill Belichick are familiar to all.</p> <p> But is the NFL as much fun as it was back in the early 1980s, when for me and a handful of others, it was a secret and guilty pleasure made all the more fascinating by the scarcity of information? Perhaps not.</p>",

Juan Mata, Jesse Lingard and Wayne Rooney were all on the bench while Anthony Martial was absent due to a training-ground injury. Yet Mourinho claimed it was Liverpool who approached the north-west duel with a defensive mind-set due to the presence of Emre Can and Jordan Henderson in central midfield.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/oct/17/paul-pogba-manchester-united-liverpool-premier-league\">Manchester United\u2019s Paul Pogba fails to live up to price tag in draw at Liverpool</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cWe stopped them playing but they also did very well from the defensive point of view,\u201d said the United manager. \u201cThey played Can and Henderson for some reason and they did that for 90 minutes when they normally project more players in attack. They were very cautious. They kept always Can and Henderson in position. They had only one player behind the three more offensive players. I think it was their intention to try and control us, which they also did well.\u201d</p> <p>Mourinho appeared aggrieved by the praise Liverpool have received for their attacking play this season and argued that Paul Pogba\u2019s latest subdued display was the result of Klopp\u2019s defensive strategy.</p> <p>He added: \u201cYou know, I think like everybody else, on the defensive side of the game he was perfect. Even the goalkeeper [David de Gea] was on holiday for 90 minutes but he had two big saves to do and he did. When we recovered the ball I was expecting the team to be more dangerous, but I think we still had some important chances and Liverpool did too. They are a very good team. You like to say they are the last wonder of the world in attacking football but they are also a team that defends and thinks defensively.

Two. Two shots on target with 65% of possession, you have to be critical of Liverpool. It is their problem, not our problem.\u201d</p> <p>Klopp claimed Liverpool lacked patience in possession and made life difficult as a consequence for Daniel Sturridge, who was replaced by Adam Lallana after 60 minutes.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/17/liverpool-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report\">David de Gea ensures Manchester United hold Liverpool in stalemate</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Liverpool manager said: \u201cI am not too happy. The game from the first second was very hectic and maybe that was what Manchester United wanted and we didn\u2019t want, maybe it was more for their advantage. That can happen from the start but you have to find your way back to the way we usually play. We lost patience far too early and our passing game was not good. We had 65% possession but we have to do better. I didn\u2019t expect we would have 10-15 chances. Second half we had chances but De Gea was finally warm and he made brilliant saves. They had that chance with Ibrahimovic.</p> <p>\u201cThe best news tonight is we have one point more and a clean sheet, nothing else. We can do much better and we must do much better. We have to stay cool. When they want to chase us, we have to use counter-movements. We had these situations but in the last third we lost patience. It was like \u2018Give it to Daniel\u2019.

  "<p>The NHS expects hospitals to go on racking up such large deficits in the next few years that it will have to divert \u00a35.4bn earmarked for improving patient care to prop them up, experts claim.</p> <p>NHS trusts in England, which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/may/20/nhs-in-england-reveals-245bn-record-deficit\">recorded a collective deficit of \u00a32.45bn</a> last year, are meant to reduce their overspending this year to only \u00a3580m to help tackle the service\u2019s acute financial problems. </p> <p>But the Nuffield Trust thinktank has discovered that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/feb/07/barts-london-hospital-trust-biggest-overspend-nhs-history\">\u00a31.8bn trusts will receive this year to help wipe out their deficits</a> will be made available to them again in 2017-18 and 2018-19, despite NHS pledges that they will have got close to balancing their books by the end of March. </p> <p>However, using that \u00a35.4bn for deficit reduction will threaten the chances of success of the NHS\u2019s plan to ensure its own future, according to Sally Gainsbury, the thinktank\u2019s senior policy analyst who unearthed the planned diversion of funds. </p> <p>That is because the money will be swallowed up by cash-strapped hospitals and will not be available to be ploughed into overhauling how care is delivered, which NHS England chief executive <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/jan/18/simon-stevens-trying-save-nhs-from-mother-of-messes\">Simon Stevens</a> has made clear is vital if the health service is to stem the rising demand for care and ensure it remains sustainable. </p> <p>The disclosure of a cash shortage in the NHS comes as Stevens and health secretary Jeremy Hunt prepare to face tough questioning from MPs on the Commons health select committee on Tuesday about the state of the service\u2019s finances. <br></p> <p>MPs are likely to ask about Theresa May\u2019s decision, revealed by the Guardian last weekend, that the NHS <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/14/no-extra-money-for-nhs-theresa-may-tells-health-chief\">will not get any extra money</a> in next month\u2019s autumn statement, despite fears that it is coming under unsustainable pressures. </p> <p>If the NHS cannot stop demand for A&amp;E and other care rising from the current 3% increase a year to the 2% increase it hopes to achieve by 2020 \u2013 which giving the extra \u00a31.8bn a year bailouts to trusts makes more unlikely \u2013 then hospitals will fail to get their finances back on track, Gainsbury added. </p> <p>\u201cThe risk is the NHS starting the next decade with a recurrent overspend of more than \u00a32bn a year, even after the painful cost cuts providers are currently being asked to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/aug/25/nhs-at-breaking-point-despite-deficit-reduction-say-trusts\">make to reduce their deficits</a>,\u201d said Gainsbury. </p> <p>\u201cThe fact that there is now less money available for investing in service transformation than originally envisaged matters because the NHS desperately needs to slow the pace at which the demand on its hospitals is growing. If that doesn\u2019t happen through careful investment in alternative services and public health improvement then the risk is it will happen instead through crude rationing and service closures.\u201d</p> <p>The planning guidance which NHS England issued to the service last month made clear that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/jul/21/nhs-england-bosses-launch-reset-plan-tackle-deficit-financial-special-measures\">sustainability and transformation fund</a>, which Hunt created last year, will \u201cfocus on supporting sustainability rather than transformation, aiming not to fund service enhancements but to sustain services\u201d.</p> <p>NHS England confirmed that all the \u00a31.8bn in the fund this year will help cover hospitals\u2019 deficits; and that of the \u00a32.9bn it has set aside for sustainability and transformation activities in both 2017-18 and 2018-19, of that \u00a31.8bn each year will be used to help ease the financial situation of NHS providers of care and the other \u00a31.1bn to transform how it cares for patients. </p> <p>Meanwhile, a survey has found that 70% of Britons are prepared to pay an extra one pence in income tax to help fund the NHS, and almost half (48%) would pay an additional two pence. </p> <p>An extra penny on the basic rate of income tax would raise around \u00a34.5bn, and 70% of those questioned for ITV1\u2019s programme The Agenda said they would be happy to see a tax hike on this scale if it was guaranteed that all the money would go to the NHS.</p> <p>The same poll found that almost half of Britons (46%) think that the NHS is performing badly, double the number (23%) who think it is performing well. </p> <p>There is little public support for charges being introduced for NHS services to help ease its financial problems. Just one in four (27%) of those questioned said they would be willing to pay \u00a35 to see their GP, while 66% said they would not. If that cost \u00a310 then only 15% would be happy to pay, while 79% said they would not.</p> <p>Chris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers, which represents hospitals, said: \u201cWe know the NHS is under the greatest pressure in a generation. Patients can see this pressure. They\u2019re saying very clearly that they are happy to pay a bit more income tax to get the right quality of care and relieve the pressure on the NHS.

Behind the calculation is a move towards imposing organic standards on farmers, the report said, which would lower crop yields.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/aug/14/organic-farming-agriculture-world-hunger\">If all food were grown organically</a>, it said wheat yields would halve, leading to a price rise of nearly 70%, potato yields would fall by 44% leading to a price increase of nearly 200%, and bean yields would fall by a quarter, leading to a price rise of more than 50%.<br></p> <p>The report attacks Friends of the Earth and farmers\u2019 unions for persuading EU officials to widen the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/22/farmers-divided-on-eu-referendum-brexit-agriculture\">remit of the CAP</a> to include regulation of food production. It said the CAP had evolved into an \u201cinterventionist\u201d and complex bureaucracy with \u201ca remit that covers a multitude of areas, from biodiversity to food safety to environmental protection, all of which have led to a huge regulatory burden on the food industry\u201d. </p> <p>Mark Littlewood, the IEA\u2019s director general, said he was concerned that official figures showed existing agricultural regulations were already costing nearly \u00a3600m every year in England. </p> <p>\u201cEU member states face staggering food price rises unless the march of increased regulation is halted. The UK is fortunate that it now has the opportunity to repatriate control of its farming regulations. </p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s crucial that decisions stem from good scientific evidence, and pay attention to consumers\u2019 interests and the potential crippling costs that overregulation can have in pushing up food prices and the cost of living.\u201d</p> <p>The report said consumers should be allowed to buy cheaper food, including genetically modified products, without the intervention of Brussels officials \u201ccaptured\u201d by special interest groups. </p> <p>It added: \u201cSince the 1990s, the growth of regulation and subsidies has gone hand-in-hand as subsidies have been increasingly tied to environmental requirements imposed on farmers. This leads to costs for consumers and taxpayers alike.<br></p> <p>\u201cOne cause of the growth in regulation is the use of the precautionary principle. This is poorly defined. However, in general, it means that the benefit of the doubt is given to the protection against any possible harm at the expense of consumer, business or economic interests.</p> <p>\u201cThe result has been a drift towards overregulation and a jettisoning of rational principles of managing and taking into account risk.\u201d<br></p>",

Their presence indicates that US troops, while not formally in a combat role, are on the frontlines and willing to use substantial airpower on Iraq\u2019s second city.</p> <p>The US command\u2019s acknowledgment of their presence is a departure from previous battles in two years\u2019 worth of war against Isis. Members of Congress have criticised the Pentagon for relaying airstrike spotting through coordination cells far from the fight, including in an operations centre in the Iraqi Kurdish capital of Erbil.</p> <p>Having US troops spotting airstrikes is both the latest departure from Barack Obama\u2019s pledge against having \u201cboots on the ground\u201d and an effort at ensuring greater specificity and lethality against Isis targets in the city.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/10/mosul-zip/giv-1406yxT7GAC08tV7/\" data-alt=\"mosul\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/10/mosul-zip/giv-1406yxT7GAC08tV7/\">mosul</a> </figure>  <p>\u201cJTACs are the difference between precision bombing and area bombing,\u201d said Christopher Harmer, a former US Navy pilot who said their presence indicated the US is willing to \u201cincur casualties\u201d in Mosul.</p> <p>\u201cWith JTACs, you can select individual targets in real time and accurately strike them. Without JTACs, you can only bomb a general area and hope for success.\u201d</p> <p>The UK and France are also believed to have their own special forces involved in retaking Mosul.

France has sent approximately 150 troops to operate four 155mm Caeser howitzers as part of its Task Force Wagram. The French aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle, carrying 24 Rafale combat planes, is also in the eastern Mediterranean to support the war.</p> <p>As the long-anticipated battle <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/17/iraqi-forces-begin-assault-on-isis-stronghold-mosul\">began on Monday</a>, US warplanes launched substantial bombing runs on positions around Mosul.

It could add fuel to the sectarian fires raging in the region and so we have urged the Iraqi government not to use the Shia militias. That is the greatest danger that we see. We actually told them to disband them, and yet they have not. They are being managed by the Iranian Revolutionary Guards. They are brutal.</p> </blockquote> <p>He added that although there had been reassurances from the Iraqi government about the deployment of Shia militias, he was not sure the Iraqi government was fully in control. He said the Iranians played a role, the Revolutionary Guards played a role, and sometimes the militias acted independently of the government. He said he supported the attack on Mosul, adding: \u201cWe support any objective which is to destroy al-Qaida absolutely.\u201d</p> <p>But he did not propose the Saudis should play a role in the reconstruction of Mosul if it is liberated. He said: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I think the Iraqis have the second largest oil reserves in the world.</p> <p>There are a number of tribes that extend from Saudi Arabia into Iraq so a lot of Iraqis have kinsmen in Saudi Arabia so our history is intertwined, and so is our future, but we have to get off this sectarian track.</p> <p>The Iraqis need to find a way to have a more incredible government \u2013 they found a way in 2014 when they removed Maliki.</p> </blockquote> <p>Jubier said that if the Daesh were forced out of Mosul, they were likely to go on to Syria, adding its president, Bashar al-Assad, would allow them to grow.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-10-17T14:06:00.063Z\">at 3.06pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5804d1ece4b08feb7300a46e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/mona-mahmood\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-17T13:30:57.489Z\">2.30pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>My colleague, <strong>Mona Mahmood,</strong> has conducted a second interview with Iraqis affected by the battle for Mosul.

It has been a real hardship since I left Mosul seven months ago and fled to Turkey with my family. I stayed in Turkey for 15 days and then returned to Sulaimaniya as I could not cope with expensive life in Turkey. It was so hard to stay in Telafer after Isis militants took over of Mosul. I\u2019m a government employee and did not get a salary for more than a year and a half \u2013 how can I feed my five kids? </p> <p>If I had stayed in Mosul my family would have died, there was no work, no freedom, no life. The strict rules of Isis were a nightmare that I challenge any human being to be able to accept them. </p> <p>I still have three brothers in Mosul with their families, they said that the battle is still at the suburbs of Mosul. They could not flee because they could not afford the cost of traveling to Turkey. Besides it is very risky, if Isis militants get hold of any one fleeing, they will execute him immediately. I paid more than $2,000 to flee with the help of a smuggler who took us to Syria and then to Turkey.</p> <p>When Isis first came, they said they came just to change the situation for the interest of Mosul civilians who suffered a great deal of injustice from the Iraqi army. Something that made all the people happy to have them and look at them as saviours from the devil, but it turned that was not right and they began to impose their hardline Islamic doctrine on people. They made our life a complete hell.</p> <p>When I had to flee I could not take anything with me and thought it was better to let my neighbour stay in my house. At least he would guard it and Isis would not confiscate it. I will get back to Mosul as soon as it is liberated. Only God knows how long the battle will last because Isis won\u2019t give up easily. They have been reinforcing their forces to be ready for the attack. They will not hand over Mosul easily, which is one of their main fortresses in Iraq.</p> <p>I will get back to my home, even if Shia militia take the city as they did in other Sunni-liberated areas in Iraq. I do not care any more, I prefer to die in my home and not to be a refugee. I will never repeat this mistake again. </p> <p>I live with my sister in Sulaimaniyia now and we are really struggling to provide the daily basics for the kids.

In total, up to 1 million people could flee their homes in search of safety during the military operation, with an estimated 700,000 requiring shelter, food, water and other vital aid.</p> <p>With emergency camps not ready for the large numbers likely to flee, the IRC anticipates that many people will find their way to abandoned buildings, schools and mosques in the towns and villages around Mosul. The IRC\u2019s mobile response teams are ready to reach 60,000 of the most vulnerable, whether they flee to the north, east or south of the city. The IRC teams will provide $420 in cash to 5,000 families (30,000 people) so they can buy food, pay rent and buy clothes, blankets and cooking utensils. Another 30,000 will be given essential items, provided with legal support or identified as needing specialist care. With more funding the IRC could increase the reach of its response to 90,000 people.</p> <p>After escaping the city, men and boys over the age of 14 will be security screened. This may take several days and it will be critical conditions are suitable, and people are provided with food, water, medical care and adequate communication on the process.

We deal with displaced families and Mosul infrastructure. We support the army with potential residential sites in Mosul that should not be targeted to avoid killing innocent people. I\u2019m a university professor, I teach chemistry at the College of Agriculture and Forestry in Mosul.</p> <p>I left Mosul the day Isis took over the city. I have not seen my relatives who are still inside Mosul for two years. I just talked to the head of a tribe in Mosul, he lives at the western bank of the the city. They are so glad for the beginning of the battle for Mosul liberation. The battle started yesterday at 2am Iraq time.</p> <p>People are desperately observing the marching of the Iraqi forces to Mosul. The mobile network is too weak and people are so scared to talk. The head of the tribe told me that all the city now is in a state of alert and he claimed that some of the Isis families are fleeing the city. Some of the roads are blocked by concrete walls, caravans and damaged cars to stop the progress of the city.</p> <p>It is too early to talk about the liberation of Mosul city, all the battles now and bombardment is against the deterrence wall set up by Isis at the suburbs of the city like al-Hamdaniya district, al-Hamam, Britla, al-Guwair and Ba\u2019ashiqa.</p> <p>The battle now is at the surrounding areas of Mosul, it might take a few weeks to get to the city centre. We have set up camps for the people who would flee the city, however, up till now, we did not receive any. None of the people are fleeing outside Mosul but they are moving from the west bank to east bank which is relatively safer. None of the tribal militia formed by the tribes of Mosul is taking part in the battle so far. There is a tribal militia at the southern part of Mosul, they are holding the ground. Their job is to keep the security inside the city after the battles.</p> <p>There are six axes for the battle of Mosul liberation \u2013 two axes are from the south-eastern part of Mosul, al-Khaziq and Ba\u2019ashiqa, where the battles are going on now. Other axes are still quiet, like the northern one in Aski Mosul, Zumar, Mosul Dam and Telkief. We think at night the army would march to these three axes. I have not seen any of the Shia militia here, they might take part in the Telafer liberation.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-10-17T13:11:37.900Z\">at 2.11pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5804b4b5e4b04312166ed6e6\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-17T11:25:45.005Z\">12.25pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, says Turkey is determined to be part of the operation to recapture Mosul, and possible talks on the city\u2019s future.</p> <p>Associated Press reports that Erdo\u011fan has reiterated Turkey\u2019s concerns that the operation could lead to sectarian clashes.

She said: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>If the campaign to retake Mosul is a success, it would not only be a massive military defeat for IS but more importantly it would be massive blow to its ideological stance. Mosul symbolises the heart of the caliphate for the group and removing this would mark the beginning of the end for a group who is already struggling for survival. The group is no longer the powerhouse that it once appeared and is in fact struggling not only to gain support but to keep the support in place that it currently has. </p> <p>The international community needs to be extremely careful in how it approaches this campaign, keeping in mind that this is not just a fight for territory, but also a fight for the hearts and minds of those who are the most fragile \u2013 the citizens of Iraq. In order for this to be a success there cannot be a repeat of the debacle that followed the 2003 invasion where the US-led coalition were essentially understaffed and unplanned for the scope of instability that would emerge across Iraq. For IS this would almost certainly be the hardest blow and would make it almost impossible for them to continue their propaganda campaign built around their creation of the caliphate. </p> <p>If Mosul were to be retaken by the allied coalition, a desperate IS may increase its levels of suicide attacks and other such methods to try to show its strength, but in reality the group is already weakened and has made little real ground in the last year. If anything they have been pushed back to levels not seen since its rapid emergence in 2014. It may be the beginning of the end for IS as we know them.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-10-17T12:02:35.659Z\">at 1.02pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5804a89ee4b047a4eaafd58c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-17T10:41:00.751Z\">11.41am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Smoke is rising over Mosul from the artillery and mortar fire and airstrikes from the US-led coalition backing Iraqi and irregular forces\u2019 assault.

One refugee who recently fled Mosul, Abu Ammar, 47, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/15/mosul-civilians-brace-assault-iraq-retake-isis-stronghold\">told the Guardian</a> that he and his family spent six hours walking through the night, through fields they feared were peppered with mines, to escape. He said: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>My kids hadn\u2019t left the house for weeks, because they were afraid of the US airstrikes, they were bombing residential areas, close to our home. The noise is horrible, windows get broken, the whole house shakes, and people get hysterical.</p> <p>I only went out if I needed to do some shopping, and tried my best to avoid Isis militants. Mostly we borrowed wheat from a neighbour, because we couldn\u2019t afford to buy it. I\u2019m a government employee and haven\u2019t been paid for two years. The only places that are open in Mosul are petrol stations, and shops with goods from Syria.</p> <p>I was trying to find a way out for months, a job somewhere to feed the kids, but I was scared to take the route to Erbil because it is planted with mines. I finally agreed to leave with four other families one night, but at the last minute the others dropped out.</p> <p>They said they had been tipped off that Isis had set up many checkpoints along the way and might capture us. I insisted on going anyway. We walked through the night for more than six hours, with my kids frightened and begging to go back.</p> </blockquote> <p>Amina Najib, 45, speaking from Mosul city centre, told the Guardian that she and her family had decided the risk of trying to escape was too great. They have stockpiled a few essentials in a room in their house to use as a shelter. She said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>People here have nothing to talk about except the horrific war that will be launched against the city soon. But in the end we reckoned it was better to stay home than risk getting caught by Isis trying to flee. My son has already had 20 lashes just for using a mobile in the street.</p> <p>I prepared a room in the house as a shelter with just some wheat to make bread and a few kilos of rice.</p> <p>Most locals don\u2019t have any cash because the government stopped paying its employees two years ago, and all our savings are wiped out. Pensioners are the lucky ones, they still get their pension via credit card, so our money comes from my cousin who is a retired teacher.</p> <p>People are worried about what comes after liberation. It is true we want to get rid of Isis but can you trust who will take power after?</p> </blockquote> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/15/mosul-civilians-brace-assault-iraq-retake-isis-stronghold\">Mosul civilians brace for assault as Iraq forces bid to retake Isis stronghold</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-580477d9e4b01ffb8ffcc73e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-17T07:12:42.994Z\">8.12am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>A senior U.N. official says he\u2019s \u201cextremely concerned\u201d for the safety of civilians in Mosul, who may be trapped between the lines or held as human shields as the attack begins on the city.</p> <p>Stephen O\u2019Brien, the under-secretary-general for humanitarian affairs and emergency relief coordinator, said in <a href=\"http://reliefweb.int/report/iraq/under-secretary-general-humanitarian-affairs-and-emergency-relief-coordinator-stephen-0\">a statement</a> last night: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Families are at extreme risk of being caught in cross-fire or targeted by snipers. Tens of thousands of Iraqi girls, boys, women and men may be under siege or held as human shields. Thousands may be forcibly expelled or trapped between the fighting lines.

Such conduct violates Khosla\u2019s constitutional rights, the complaint states.</p> <p>Khosla\u2019s lawyers point out that the Deeney family, which owned the property from the 1900s to 2008, was not subject to the same scrutiny. It was the Deeney family who installed a fence, locked gate and \u201cno trespassing\u201d signs, and they would lock the gate to close the road to the beach \u201cany time they felt like it\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIt was routinely closed for private events and in the winter. They did not apply for a permit and were never told by any public official or entity that a permit was required,\u201d said Khosla\u2019s attorney, Dori Yob, in a statement.</p> <p>\u201cHowever, when the subsequent owner continued these practices they were met with threats and harassment in an attempt to coerce them to forfeit their private property rights and allow public access to the property on terms of the County and Coastal Commission\u2019s choosing,\u201d she added.</p> <p>Yob also said there had been \u201cextensive misreporting\u201d in the media about the case, including the assertion, first made in the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/24/business/tech-mogul-asks-for-30-million-to-reopen-martins-beach.html?module=WatchingPortal&amp;region=c-column-middle-span-region&amp;pgType=Homepage&amp;action=click&amp;mediaId=thumb_square&amp;state=standard&amp;contentPlacement=1&amp;version=internal&amp;contentCollection=www.nytimes.com&amp;contentId=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2016%2F02%2F24%2Fbusiness%2Ftech-mogul-asks-for-30-million-to-reopen-martins-beach.html&amp;eventName=Watching-article-click&amp;_r=1\">New York Times</a>, that Khosla offered to sell access rights to the beach for $30m. \u201cThere was never an offer to sell,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Yob points out that the Deeney family sold the property because it was unprofitable and that the state had an opportunity to buy it but decided not to. \u201cNow it wants for free what they did not want to pay for,\u201d Yob said.</p> <p>The Surfrider Foundation, a group that has campaigned to restore public access to the beach, disagrees with Yob\u2019s interpretation of events.</p> <p>\u201cTo allege unfair treatment is absurd,\u201d said the foundation\u2019s legal director, Angela Howe, in <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.surfrider.org/coastal-blog/entry/khosla-comes-out-swinging-new-lawsuit-filed-against-ccc-slc-and-county-by-m\">a statement</a>. \u201cKhosla is merely being asked by the county, state lands commission and coastal commission to follow the law and honor the beach access rights of California citizens.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how state agencies could harass and coerce such a powerful man,\u201d she added in a phone interview. \u201cIt\u2019s almost laughable.\u201d</p> <p>The Deeneys wanted people to enjoy the beach and worked with local officials to make that possible, she said. Khosla is being treated differently than the Deeney family because he acted very differently \u2013 with \u201ctotal disregard\u201d for the public\u2019s right to access and enjoy the beach.</p> <p>\u201cMartins Beach is part of the fabric of the community of Half Moon Bay and has been open for generations to the public,\u201d said Howe. </p> <p>\u201cAs San Francisco is becoming gentrified, you are getting a lot of money from Silicon Valley taking away public resources.

This must be done before article 50 negotiations start.\u201d</p> <p>In a sign of continued tension between leave and remain campaigners, the international development secretary, Priti Patel, said that those trying to force a debate and vote on article 50 were trying to \u201csubvert the economic will of the British public\u201d. </p> <p>Other Brexit supporters, including David Davis and Liam Fox, have hinted at the idea of Britain accepting much looser economic ties with the EU in order to deliver a hard Brexit.</p> <p>However, the issue of membership of the customs union is also still being considered, the Guardian understands, with a paper on its pros and cons presented at a meeting of May\u2019s Brexit cabinet committee last week. <br></p> <p>On migration, Rudd\u2019s suggestion of a visa-entry scheme for skilled workers is not the only option being considered. Under Rudd\u2019s plans, which aim to significantly cut net migration, EU workers would need to have a skilled job before being allowed into Britain. <br></p> <p>Although Brexit supporters were reported to have been angered by Hammond\u2019s cautious approach at the meeting, with some accusing him of \u201carguing like an accountant seeing the risk of everything\u201d, his approach was accepted with ministers leaving all options open.</p> <p>The Brexit committee includes Hammond, Clark and Green, as well as May, Rudd and the Tory chair \u2013 who backed remain \u2013 Patrick McLoughlin. But it also has ardent Brexit supporters: David Davis, Boris Johnson, Liam Fox, Priti Patel, Chris Grayling and Andrea Leadsom. <br></p> <p>Although May has said that the UK must regain control of its borders and no longer be under the jurisdiction of the European court of justice, she has left a series of other possibilities open, according to sources. </p> <p>May knows that there are about 20 to 30 Conservative backbenchers who have significant concerns about the direction of the government\u2019s Brexit policy without greater parliamentary scrutiny.</p> <p>This led Gavin Williamson, the chief whip, to tell the prime minister last week that they could lose the House of Commons vote called by Labour demanding a proper debate on leaving the EU before article 50 is triggered.</p>",
  "<p>Nobody announces anything on a Sunday afternoon. Nobody except Rockstar, of course. </p> <p>The publisher behind the multimillion selling Grand Theft Auto series put out one tweet on the afternoon of 16 October \u2013 a refreshed version of its own logo, on a red background. That was it. So far the message has been retweeted 110,000 times. </p> <p>This is not how the games industry tends to hype its forthcoming announcements. Big companies pump millions of dollars into events like E3 or Gamescom to ensure a huge audience for their meticulously designed teaser trailers. They set up hashtags, get prominent YouTubers onboard, roll out pan-global campaigns from 24-hour command centres, then obsess over every column inch of coverage. Rockstar changed its logo colour. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/RockstarGames/status/787639249864630273\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"und\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://t.co/BklXMlZ0UQ\">pic.twitter.com/BklXMlZ0UQ</a></p>&mdash; Rockstar Games (@RockstarGames) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RockstarGames/status/787639249864630273\">October 16, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>What\u2019s this all about? Well, it\u2019s about Red Dead Redemption. </p> <p>The publisher\u2019s 2010 western epic was a massive critical and commercial hit, bringing the open-world dynamic of GTA to the American frontier of 1911. With a wizened, Eastwood-esque hero in the shape of John Marston, a bloody revenge narrative and an elegiac tone, the game presented a vision of the wild west every bit as compelling, brutish and beautiful as anything from Leone or Peckinpah. Now it appears, a new title is coming.<br></p> <p>But no one is quite sure what. A following tweet, posted 24 hours later, showed seven figures silhouetted against a huge orange sun \u2013 seemingly referencing The Magnificent Seven; a timely decision considering the recent movie remake. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/RockstarGames/status/788001608827281408\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"und\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://t.co/iuwxwyL2cX\">pic.twitter.com/iuwxwyL2cX</a></p>&mdash; Rockstar Games (@RockstarGames) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RockstarGames/status/788001608827281408\">October 17, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>It\u2019s totally unclear whether we should expect a HD remake of the original game (and/or its forbearer, Red Dead Revolver), a sequel or a prequel. Most fans are expecting the latter option, an earlier tale from the adventures of Marsten. Many have also seen <a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/news/gaming/this-is-the-map-you-ll-be-playing-in-red-dead-redemption-2-1319101\">a leaked map of the game</a>, purporting to be the setting for the prequel \u2013 an area of land just to the east of Red Dead Redemption\u2019s territory. But none of this has been confirmed. Because Rockstar doesn\u2019t do confirmations. </p> <p>It doesn\u2019t need to. Within an hour of the first tweet, there was already news coverage of the logo alteration on every major gaming and tech site on the web, and with the second message, it has turned into a rolling story. A trailer is expected to follow, perhaps sometime this week, with a launch possible in October. Rockstar will reveal more when the company is good and ready.</p> <p>It\u2019s a fascinating story in this era of corporate messaging desperation; when the prevailing wisdom is, hit every platform hard. Rockstar doesn\u2019t attend big industry events like E3, Gamescom, Pax or EGX, and it doesn\u2019t align its announcements with the usual beats of the industry year. For Grand Theft Auto V, a tweet with just \u201c#GTAV\u201d arrived on 25 October, 2011, followed by a trailer a week later. That game went on to sell over 65m copies. Red Dead is smaller fry with sales of around 15m, but it\u2019s been so long since we heard anything from Rockstar, the company could probably have announced a follow-up to its under-appreciated 2006 release Table Tennis and it would have created a storm.</p> <p>As it is Red Dead is seen by some as Rockstar\u2019s true masterpiece, a less corrosive, less bombastic proposition than GTA, suffused in the mythology and slower pace of the western. Everyone was expecting some kind of follow-up this year, but the publisher has left it late to say anything \u2013 and really it still hasn\u2019t said anything. It must have known, however, the massive interest its two tweets would make, surely ruling out a mere HD update. Even Rockstar couldn\u2019t get away with that. </p> <p>The arch manipulator of video game fandom knows what it is doing. The slowest of slow burn releases. Let the forums and social media do the heavy lifting. If the game is as clever as its understated \u201cannouncement\u201d it will surely live up to the anti-hype.</p>",
  "<p>Three men accused of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/14/bomb-plot-somali-immigrant-kansas-militia-charged\">plotting a \u201cbloodbath\u201d</a> of Somali immigrants in a small Kansas town in order to provoke a religious war appeared in court on Monday and were ordered to remain in custody. </p> <p>Patrick Stein, Curtis Allen and Gavin Wright are suspected of planning a domestic terrorist attack to destroy an apartment complex that is home to about 120 Somali people in Garden City.</p> <p>The men were charged last week with conspiring to use a weapon of mass destruction and face up to life in prison if convicted. </p> <p>Since February, the FBI has conducted an investigation into a small anti-government, anti-immigrant, anti-Muslim militia group in south-west Kansas called the Crusaders, according to the criminal complaint.</p> <p>The trio met on 14 August and decided they would blow up the complex with four explosive-laden vehicles \u2013 one on each corner \u2013 because a large Somali community lives there and uses one of the apartments as a mosque, the complaint alleged.</p> <p>Garden City, 210 miles west of Wichita, has a diverse population of about 27,000 people, many working at a meatpacking plant. It has previously been cited as a <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2013/12/11/249981976/a-midwestern-meatpacking-town-welcomes-immigrants\">successful example</a> of the rapid assimilation of a multicultural population into a rural area.</p> <p>\u201cThis presented an escalated level of planned violence that we [in Kansas] have not experienced before,\u201d said Moussa Elbayoumy, the board chairman of the Kansas chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations. He said the thwarted attack \u201cconfirms what we\u2019re hearing from law enforcement authorities all along, that the biggest threat to safety and security in the US is not from Muslim terrorists or anything like that, it\u2019s mostly from homegrown militia-type terrorists\u201d.</p> <p>After the August meeting, authorities said, the group began to formulate more detailed plans about how to source materials and carry out the attack while evading detection. The carnage would take place at prayer time for maximum loss of life.</p> <p>All the accused are in their late 40s. One of the plotters, Allen, works at a mobile home business owned by Wright, authorities said. The complaint says the suspects and their communications were monitored and recorded by an informant. It contains numerous disturbing details about their alleged fantasies and schemes. Stein described Somali people as \u201ccockroaches\u201d who needed to be eliminated, court documents say. </p> <p>Allen is said to have suggested making signs that say \u201cI support illegal immigration, I go against the constitution on a daily basis\u201d, and then \u201cfor every one of them [Somalis] that we blow the top of their head off we just put that around their neck\u201d.</p> <p>On other occasions, Stein is said to have suggested carrying out an attack against Muslim refugees in Garden City in retaliation for the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/orlando-terror-attack\">Orlando nightclub mass shooting</a> and to have floated the ideas of blowing up apartments using rocket-propelled grenades, kicking in doors of homes where Somali people lived and shooting them one by one, firing at them with a bow and arrow dipped in pig\u2019s blood, and burning down churches that have helped refugees. </p> <p>\u201cThe only fucking way this country\u2019s ever going to get turned around is it will be a bloodbath,\u201d Stein allegedly said. </p> <p>At another time, he reportedly said: \u201cThe only good Muslim is a dead Muslim\u201d and \u201cIf you\u2019re a Muslim I\u2019m going to enjoy shooting you in the head \u2026 When we go on operations there\u2019s no leaving anyone behind, even if it\u2019s a one-year-old. I\u2019m serious. I guarantee if I go on a mission those little fuckers are going bye-bye.\u201d</p> <p>During a meeting in July, the complaint said, the men discussed a wide range of targets they believed were Muslims or sympathetic to Muslims, and Wright \u201cpulled up Google Maps on the computer at his business and began dropping pins on the map at these various locations using the label \u2018cockroaches\u2019 \u2026 The group brainstormed various methods of attack, including murder, kidnapping, rape, and arson.\u201d</p> <p>Allen was arrested in the Kansas city of Liberal on 11 October after his girlfriend contacted local police to say he had physically attacked her during an argument. Police said they found a large amount of ammunition in his car and close to 1,000kg (2,200lbs) worth of ammunition at his home. Later that day, the woman told the FBI that within the past two weeks she had watched Allen make what appeared to be homemade explosives.</p> <p>On 12 October, with Allen\u2019s arrest putting the plot under pressure, Stein allegedly met with someone he believed could supply guns and bomb components and tried out two automatic rifles in a rural location near Garden City. But the supplier was an undercover FBI employee and the weapons came from an FBI laboratory in Quantico, Virginia.</p> <p>Detention hearings for Stein and Wright were set for Friday and for Allen next Monday. Their attorneys declined to comment after the hearing.</p>",

  "<p>The verdict of a jury last Friday <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/14/footballer-ched-evans-cleared-of-in-retrial\" title=\"\">that found Ched Evans not guilty</a> of rape appears to be a devastating setback for justice for rape victims. The footballer admits that he had sex with a woman he barely knew, who was drunk, and to whom he addressed not a word. He was convicted by the first jury to try him in 2011. But at his retrial, the jury decided they could not be certain that the woman had not consented, a verdict they reached after they had heard evidence that she had behaved in a similar manner with two other men at around the same time. Everything about this case stinks. A rich young man who on his own admission behaved in a way that most people would find unacceptable is found not guilty, while his victim, a young woman who was only 19 at the time, has had to move house five times, change her identity twice after Twitter trolls outed her on social media, and now has her alleged sexual history spread over the tabloids.</p> <p>It is true that not all the evidence that Mr Evans\u2019 legal team finally won on was available at the first trial. A subsequent appeal against conviction was dismissed. Only after a new legal team was employed was the original evidence reconsidered and the witnesses re-interviewed. A new defence was presented to the Criminal Cases Review Commission. The court of appeal considered the new evidence and decided that it met the condition of \u201csimilar fact\u201d: that meant there could be a retrial, and the new evidence of sexual behaviour could be introduced. Explaining her reasons, Lady Justice Hallett admitted she did so with \u201ca considerable degree of hesitation\u201d.</p> <p>The judge was unquestionably fulfilling the requirements of the law as she understood it. But sometimes the law is wrong.</p> <p>There is real concern that this sequence of events will make the prosecution of rape cases harder and reporting rarer. The verdict breathes fresh life into the old prejudice that how a woman has behaved in the past can be taken as evidence of the way she behaved at the time of the alleged rape, that \u2013 in the ancient formulation \u2013 \u201cunchaste women are more likely to consent and less worthy of belief\u201d. It will deter victims from going to the police for fear of having their private lives raked over; it could make convictions, already hard to achieve, even harder; and it will further embolden defence lawyers in rape trials who know how effective it is to apply for sexual history to be admissible, a&#xa0;tactic that even when it is disallowed has <a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiAkfG-jeLPAhXiYpoKHeuTD6EQFggcMAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fciteseerx.ist.psu.edu%2Fviewdoc%2Fdownload%3Fdoi%3D10.1.1.628.3925%26rep%3Drep1%26type%3Dpdf&amp;usg=AFQjCNHCs-JXqI34sYDZRoZXB5jzvTqWBA&amp;sig2=H0eNZPXlwKegDAcwe71I_w&amp;bvm=bv.135974163,d.bGs\" title=\"\">been shown to influence jurors\u2019</a> opinion of the victim and lead to more acquittals \u2013 just when the leap of 123% in reported rape over the past five years already suggests England and Wales <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/oct/13/reported-rapes-in-england-and-wales-double-in-five-years\" title=\"\">are facing an epidemic</a> that neither police nor courts can keep up with.</p> <p>Until the <a href=\"http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1999/apr/15/youth-justice-and-criminal-evidence-bill\" title=\"\">Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Act</a> in 1999 outlawed the introduction of sexual history in most cases, it was a commonplace defence strategy. It&#xa0;took years of campaigning, and the election of a Labour government, before parliament finally accepted that the only relevant factor is consent, or a reasonable belief in consent. But late in the day, an exemption was introduced in the interests, the then <a href=\"http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1999/apr/15/youth-justice-and-criminal-evidence-bill\" title=\"\">home secretary Jack Straw argued</a>, of justice for defendants.

But, like the oracle of Delphi, they also warned of the continuing damage done by victim-blaming attitudes that deter women from coming forward. The trauma of rape, and the persistent claim that consent can be deduced rather than clearly established, all indicate that the use of sexual history needs to be looked at again.</p>",
  "<p>Question: which G7 economy on Monday saw its 10-year bond yields trade at levels higher than on 23 June, the day of the UK\u2019s referendum? Despite the sudden panic about \u201csoaring\u201d gilt yields and thus the rise in the government\u2019s cost of borrowing, the answer is not the UK. It is the US.</p> <p>The question is a slight cheat in the sense that US 10-year Treasury yields have barely budged \u2013 they were 1.74% on referendum day, fell to 1.32% in early July and are now 1.76%. But a comparison with the US makes a useful point. The UK\u2019s journey from 1.37% to 0.5% to 1.11% can be made to resemble a screeching handbrake turn because yields have doubled from their low point. But, viewed in the round, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/17/uk-government-bond-sell-off-continues-keeping-pressure-on-pound\">gilt yields haven\u2019t strayed very far</a> from the curve taken by most G7 countries\u2019 bond markets since the summer.</p> <p>Even Germany\u2019s 10-year bund rates, as Oxford Economics points out, are close to their pre-UK referendum levels \u2013 albeit Germany\u2019s cost of borrowing for 10 years is close to zero.</p> <p>The thinktank offers other reasons to be sanguine about gilt yields. For example, the UK\u2019s cost of borrowing is still remarkably low. Over the past 80 years, UK governments have paid an average of 6.4% to borrow for a 10-year period, it calculates. We will discover next month how much chancellor Philip Hammond intends to borrow to spend on infrastructure and suchlike, but it would be amazing if he has altered his plans because of the up-tick in gilt yields in the past three weeks.</p> <p>Indeed, gilts always have to be viewed against the backdrop of inflation expectations. As the pound has fallen, so have investors naturally come to predict a higher rate of inflation in the UK over the next decade. But the government can still borrow well below the expected rate of inflation of 3%.</p> <p>It would be ridiculous, of course, to assume conditions will remain so benign forever. There are dangers from many directions. A further downwards lurch for the pound, an inflation shock (September\u2019s data will be published on Tuesday), or a Brexit-related collapse in business investment could all upset investors\u2019 appetite for gilts. But let\u2019s at least use a sensible definition of what would represent a crisis: a yield of 1.11% is not even close.</p> <h2>Poorer Pearson?</h2> <p>Pearson is testing the faith of its loyal shareholders. A 13% fall in North American revenues was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/17/pearson-shares-sales-publisher-trading-conditions\">a scary-looking figure to unveil at the nine-month stage</a>, even if it looks much gentler in sterling terms.<br></p> <p>Don\u2019t worry, says chief executive John Fallon, there\u2019s an explanation. Bookshops at US university and college campuses have been running down stocks of textbooks to get their inventories under control. When that period passes, Pearson will be seen to have suffered merely a slight hiccup.</p> <p>For the time being, hope is alive \u2013 as are this year\u2019s earnings forecasts. The entire US education market has been moving to digital formats and Pearson has tried to get ahead of the trend by cutting 4,000 jobs, 10% of its workforce. It would not be surprising if campus bookshops have been slower to react and are now adjusting in haste.</p> <p>Yet the nagging doubt is whether the digital drift will leave publishers permanently poorer in a world where students have gained the ability to rent materials, for example. Fallon needs to show that Pearson can still grow sales in the US college market. Judgment day arrives next year.</p> <p>If all goes to plan, operating profits will improve from about \u00a3600m this year to \u00a3800m in 2018. Terrific if it happens because a dividend yielding almost 7% would look considerably safer. Monday\u2019s 8% fall in the share price says the market remains sceptical.</p> <h2>Biffa cuts and floats</h2> <p>Biffa\u2019s private equity backers were clearly extremely anxious to see the waste management firm floated. They agreed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/17/waste-disposal-firm-biffa-cuts-flotation-price-brexit-jitters\">to cut the price</a> of the shares to 180p from a reputed 220p-270p. And, instead of selling a few shares themselves, the owners have ended up increasing their investment. Current shareholders chipped in \u00a350m of the \u00a3262m raised by Biffa.</p> <p>In the shoes of Bain Capital, Angelo Gordon and Avenue Europe, you might be tempted to ask for a refund from your battalion of bankers on the float \u2013 Citi, JP Morgan, HSBC, Peel Hunt and Rothschild. No chance. The prospectus reveals the expected expenses of the offer will be \u00a319.6m \u2013 call it a 9% rake-off from the new shareholders\u2019 \u00a3212m.

  "<p>On Friday morning, the bookies assume, there will be a new Conservative MP for Witney, the constituency suddenly vacated by David Cameron when he resigned last month. While few doubt that the Tory candidate, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/22/robert-courts-chosen-tory-candidate-david-cameron-constituency\" title=\"\">Robert Courts</a>, will win, it is likely he will have no more than 40% of the vote, where his predecessor won 60%.</p> <p>Courts faces a strong Liberal Democrat challenge and an equally strong Labour one. These two candidates will split the not-Conservative vote and allow Courts to become another name in the long succession of Tory MPs for west Oxfordshire. His victory will be taken as an endorsement of Theresa May\u2019s divisive and sometimes dangerous rhetoric about Brexit.

These are issues that many voters in Witney, a constituency that voted to remain in the EU by 54% to 46%, care about deeply. These are people who trek into Oxford to join <a href=\"https://en-gb.fievent.com/e/let-the-children-in-refugees-welcome/4534089\" title=\"\">Refugees Welcome</a> marches like the one last week, and who support the local council\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.westoxon.gov.uk/residents/communities/help-for-refugees/\" title=\"\">Asylum Welcome</a> work.</p> <p>But instead, even though the two main challengers are actually working together on the council to set up a community transport company to replace newly axed bus services, for the past three weeks they have been fighting each other over the sterile territory of who\u2019s to blame for the cuts. What an indictment this byelection will be of British politics\u2019 destructive preference for the narcissism of small differences.</p> <p>Over the next two years, Britain will be remade by a government with a working majority of 12. This new country that is being born will be out of Europe, its territorial integrity under threat from nationalism and its outlook narrow and sometimes xenophobic. It is a place where millions of people will find themselves ill at ease. Proof of identity will become part of everyday life, not just an inconvenience for under-25s at a party. And the first serious opportunity to challenge its direction is taken as the opportunity to debate local buses.</p> <p>It is typical of the reductionist style of politics that has undermined the capacity of Westminster to represent the whole country. It may be why people who ran street stalls during the referendum campaign report that time after time they found bewilderment about what was at stake. This is the lesson: if you treat voters as if they are nothing but a compound of self-interested behaviours, then that\u2019s what you get.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cb3c238261e79ba3a31bdbeff3a0abaf0391c07a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cb3c238261e79ba3a31bdbeff3a0abaf0391c07a/0_0_4928_2957/1000.jpg\" alt=\"David and Samantha Cameron\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">David Cameron with his wife, Samantha, just before he resigned.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Geoff Caddick/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The EU referendum should have left voters in no doubt about the power of their vote. Byelections, held at critical moments such as this one, can do something more subtle but just as powerful. Cameron is far too tactical a politician not to have been aware of the hold that a few thousand voters can exert over a government, not least one embarking on the fraught and uncertain route to Brexit. A campaign that challenged May\u2019s determination to remake Britain by executive fiat, and demanded instead that parliament be allowed its central role in shaping the country\u2019s future could have helped to influence wider public opinion and the political context.</p> <p>In the 1930s, perhaps the last period when the national mood was so uncertain, byelections became a way of demonstrating opposition to government policy. Depression, economic collapse and the rise of fascism had split the Labour party, destroyed the Liberals and left the country in the control of a single party.</p> <p>In 1933, after the Fulham East byelection was won by John Wilmot, a pacifist Labour candidate, Stanley Baldwin was persuaded not to campaign for rearmament. Five years later, after the \u201cpeace in our time\u201d Munich agreement in 1938, a series of byelections \u2013 most famously in Oxford and Bridgwater \u2013 became in effect plebiscites on Neville Chamberlain\u2019s policy of appeasement.</p> <p>The main opposition parties were as reluctant to stand a single candidate then as now. A Labour MP who came to support the anti-appeasement candidate in Bridgwater <a href=\"http://vernonbartlett.co.uk/which-side-are-you-on/the-result/\" title=\"\">summed up the attitude</a>: \u201cI have not departed one iota from my Labour principles. When the campaign is over I shall go back again to the party to which I belong. Until then I feel there is much work to be done in making a protest against this government.\u201d Victory for the Liberal Vernon Bartlett did not change government policy. But it did challenge the orthodoxy.</p> <p>West Oxfordshire has already had one moment in history: in 1990, at the height of the political row over the poll tax, 18 Conservative councillors in Witney <a href=\"http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/11951319.England_apos_s_poll_tax_rebels_view_future_with_resignation/\" title=\"\">resigned</a> in protest at a tax that fell hardest on the least able to pay. Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, told Margaret Thatcher it was serious. Their action didn\u2019t quite defeat the policy, but it was a revolt that significantly loosened Thatcher\u2019s grip on power.</p> <p>This week there will be no unambivalent message for May, no irrefutable clarion call to end the anti-migrant rhetoric and work for as soft a Brexit as possible. Witney 2016 could have been another byelection that changed Britain. Instead it will be business as usual.</p>",
  "<p> Imagine a story with so much inherent drama it sounds far-fetched even for a Hollywood thriller. Our heroes dig tunnels from freedom into enemy territory to help loved ones and others escape. They are bankrolled in part by a savvy media executive looking for a network exclusive. Meanwhile, the White House seeks to shut it all down in the interest of politics \u2013 and avoiding nuclear war.</p> <p> It sounds over the top but it\u2019s all true and detailed in Greg Mitchell\u2019s new book, <a href=\"http://gregmitchellauthor.com/books/the-tunnels-tr/the-tunnels-hc\">The Tunnels: Escapes Under the Berlin Wall and the Historic Films the JFK White House Tried to Kill</a><em>. </em>Utilizing a mix of interviews and archival records Mitchell tells a kaleidoscopic cold war story from 1962, recreating a world seemingly on the edge of a third world war. </p> <p> The action revolves around the brave and indefatigable young Germans of West Berlin who take up shovels against repression; yet even as they aid the escape of those trapped in East Berlin, they are undermined by a Stasi informer in their midst. Mitchell also recounts the efforts of CBS and NBC reporters and executives to gain an upper hand in their own competition by racing to secure the rights to film a tunnel escape for the education \u2013 or perhaps entertainment \u2013 of the American audience back home. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"cecbe98152fd8ae8e110dd7059fc50ea39509a1c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cecbe98152fd8ae8e110dd7059fc50ea39509a1c/0_0_2046_3000/682.jpg\" alt=\"Edward Kennedy inspect the Berlin Wall at Bernauer Street in 1962.\" width=\"682\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Edward Kennedy inspect the Berlin Wall at Bernauer Street in 1962.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Reichert/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>President John F Kennedy\u2019s administration, meanwhile, aims to control the media\u2019s message, perhaps out of general distrust of the press, perhaps out of political concerns, including the all-too-real notion that the Soviet Union could interpret American involvement as a step toward war. </p> <p> All of this plays out against an increasingly fraught backdrop as East German guards shoot fellow citizens in cold blood as they try to escape, West German officials break the law to help escapees and the Soviets begin maneuvers for what will become the Cuban missile crisis. </p> <p> \u201cIt\u2019s not a very nice solution,\u201d Kennedy said of the Berlin Wall as it went up, \u201cbut a wall is a hell of a lot better than a war.\u201d </p> <p> Mitchell, 68, has written numerous books about the intersection of American politics and media and about nuclear war. The former editor both of <a href=\"http://cironline.org/partners/nuclear-times\">Nuclear Times</a> and <a href=\"http://www.editorandpublisher.com/\">Editor &amp; Publisher</a> magazines, he stumbled on to the idea for The Tunnels<em> </em>when his daughter and her husband moved to Berlin. He went to visit them at their new home which turned out to be about a mile from <a href=\"http://www.berliner-mauer-gedenkstaette.de/en/\">Bernauer Strasse</a>, the former East Berlin street that turned out to be the focal point of much of the book\u2019s action. </p> <p> \u201cI knew about the Berlin Wall, of course,\u201d Mitchell says. \u201cI grew up with Berlin being in the news all the time and I had the childhood trauma of fallout shelters, air raid drills and duck and cover. My favorite movie was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/feb/11/us-military-propaganda-film\">Dr Strangelove, Or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb</a>.\u201d</p> <p> But what he knew about the wall was fairly general and it all felt like part of a distant past until that visit. \u201cGoing to the memorial site and reading the stories about the escapes was overwhelming,\u201d he says. \u201cSeeing the \u2018death strip\u2019 made it all very vivid.\u201d </p> <p> Mitchell started digging in to the escape stories and was particularly drawn to the notion that those living in freedom, including many who had escaped East Berlin, were willing to tunnel directly into danger to help others. \u201cThat story was incredible enough with plenty of suspense,\u201d he says, though he felt like it was a \u201cforeign story\u201d Americans would not be interested in \u2013 indeed, while the sagas have been recounted in German language books, they have never been told in full detail here. But then he uncovered the story of the television documentaries and the White House\u2019s efforts to suppress them and realized \u201cthis was also an American story\u201d.</p> <p> Hollywood recognized its potential before the book industry did. His proposal sold its movie rights, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/paulgreengrass\">Paul Greengrass</a> attached as director, even before he had found a publisher. \u201cThat was a little odd and embarrassing for a moment,\u201d Mitchell says. </p> <p> Mitchell says he was fortunate that his son-in-law is half-German because he provided vital help in translating Stasi archives \u2013 many never seen in public before \u2013 and interpreting during interviews. \u201cI had a list of 20 people and hoped to get six, not knowing who would be alive or well enough or willing to talk,\u201d Mitchell says. Instead, he found 16, including the major West Berlin diggers. </p> <p> In writing, Mitchell strove to be even-handed. \u201cI hate to announce a stand,\u201d he says. On the issue of Kennedy\u2019s decision to allow the wall to be built and his efforts to shape the media\u2019s coverage of the escape attempts, he knows some of the president\u2019s methods seemed wrong then and would be taboo today but believes that the genuine threat of nuclear war changed the equation. </p> <p>\u201cHalf the readers will say I\u2019m too hard on him and he had to worry about the end of the world while the other half will say he was too cautious and should have done more to support the people trying to escape,\u201d Mitchell says, adding that there will be also conflicting views on the networks dishing out money to the tunnelers in exchange for filming rights. </p> <p> While the events are a half-century old, they resonate today in a world trying to figure out how to handle escaped refugees, walls real (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/may/10/william-sutcliffe-west-bank-wall\">imposed on the West Bank by Israel</a>) and proposed (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/31/donald-trump-mexico-meeting-president-pena-nieto-immigration\">Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cgreat, great wall\u201d</a>), and deepening tensions between the US and Russia which are exacerbated by media leaks. \u201cIt all makes me feel like I\u2019m back in 1962,\u201d Mitchell says. </p>",
  "<p>The footballer Ched Evans had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/16/ched-evans-calls-for-education-on-alcohol-and-consent\" title=\"\">much to say following his rape acquittal</a>, and the weekend newspapers gave him a platform to say it. Now rape campaigners must come to terms with the legacy of his case. By clearing the way for two men to tell the jury they\u2019d had sex with the complainant, the court of appeal effectively converted his earlier conviction <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/14/footballer-ched-evans-cleared-of-in-retrial\" title=\"\">into an acquittal</a>. Some lawyers say this was a rare case and doubt that, as a precedent, it will affect many future cases. But other lawyers \u2013 and I am one of them \u2013 fear that rape trials could become inquisitions into the complainant\u2019s sex life.</p> <p>We seem to be returning to a mindset and practices we thought were confined to history. In seeking \u2013 as we now must \u2013 to find a new way forward, it\u2019s worth recalling how we reached this point.</p> <p>The fear of a complainant being confronted with evidence relating to sex with other men is, and has always been, a huge deterrent to reporting rape. In 1976 judges were given powers to prevent defence lawyers using that tactic, but the discretion they enjoyed was wide, unregulated and infrequently used. So a rape defendant could bring Mr B and Mr C to testify that the complainant had had consensual sex with them. The argument would run, she consented to me as well because she\u2019ll have sex with anyone. The two arguments \u2013 she\u2019s a tart and you can\u2019t believe a word she says \u2013 were what women, not surprisingly, feared. These were the \u201ctwin myths\u201d that flowed from the use of previous sexual history.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>One in five trials sees an application for sexual history to be heard, even now</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In 1999, the Labour government curtailed the use of complainants\u2019 sexual conduct with other people as evidence of consent; but so entrenched was the perception among complainants that four years later a review of the legislation showed it was still a key factor in low reporting rates.</p> <p>Whatever the truth of this kind of testimony, it was usually irrelevant to the charge itself. Lord Steyn, in the House of Lords case of R v A (No 2) referred to in Evans second appeal, said that: \u201cQuestioning and evidence about the complainant\u2019s sexual experience with other men \u2026 are almost always irrelevant to the issue whether the complainant consented to sexual intercourse on the occasion alleged in the indictment or to her credibility.\u201d</p> <p>Yet as a tactic, it worked. Rape allegations judged strong enough to take to court by the Crown Prosecution Service were routinely lost. Brothers, cousins and men from the pub came to say they too had had sex with her. Jurors continually fell prey to the twin myths.</p> <p>Campaigning for change in the late 90s, I wrote a pamphlet called Rape in Court and mentioned research by a Canadian academic who showed that the chances of a conviction in a rape trial were inversely proportional to the extent of sexual allegations made against a complainant. The more there was alleged, even if every bit of it was denied, the less the chance of a conviction. Add to that Lord Steyn\u2019s view, and it is clear that many acquittals were gained by prejudice.</p> <p>The clause utilised by lawyers for Evans was only added towards the end of the 1999 bill\u2019s progress through parliament. It reversed the exclusion of sexual history evidence \u2013 if what the defendant alleged was sex between the complainant and another that was \u201cso similar\u201d to what was alleged in the rape that it could not be explained by coincidence. It has hardly ever been used.</p> <p>The key case in which it was used concerned a couple having consensual sex, standing upright inside a children\u2019s climbing frame. It was alleged that on a second such occasion, with the same partner, it was rape.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/17/ched-evans-football-industry-harassment-respect-women\">The Ched Evans case shines a light on football\u2019s dark corners | Gemma Clarke</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In Evans\u2019 case, the court of appeal decided it \u201crelevant and admissible\u201d that the woman had had separate sexual encounters with two men, around the time of the alleged rape. On each occasion she had consumed a lot of alcohol, and had been enthusiastic, directing sexual events. She used similar words calling for more vigour from the male partner, and, once with each man, used a particular, though not uncommon, sexual position. Evans said she behaved similarly with him. Since this was presumably her typical conduct in consensual sex, it supported his case that she\u2019d consented with him. But by any evaluation, these \u201csimilarities\u201d are of a significantly lower scale than in the case of the climbing frame in terms of proving typical behaviour.</p> <p>And therein lies the danger. Why wouldn\u2019t most defendants, claiming consent, not check out the Evans defence? Why would they not seek to find out whether the woman has had sex with somebody else \u201csimilar\u201d in style to that with the defendant? Evans had funding and private investigators. The current protections were not able to shield her and could be equally weak against a local search for witnesses and the do-it-yourself sleuthing that might be the poor man\u2019s way. Consider the impact of such an intrusive investigation on the life of a complainant, and then her potential exposure to intimate questioning in court.</p> <p>The potency of the \u201ctwin myths\u201d is still well understood. One in five trials sees an application for sexual history to be heard, even now.</p> <p>So is Evans\u2019 case a rarity, or has the court, by lowering the bar of what is \u201cadmissible and relevant\u201d, unintentionally lent itself to a potential return to the bad old days? If we are to not lose the recent upturn in rape reporting, and the slowly growing willingness of complainants to speak out, we must be vigilant.

Fox has put together an all-star cast including Laverne Cox, Adam Lambert, Victoria Justice, Reeve Carney, Christina Milian, Ben Vereen, and the original Dr Frank-N-Furter, Tim Curry, to remake this 1975 cult classic about two uptight teens who wander into a sci-fi world of decadence.

In this episode of Great Performances, the long-running PBS show takes a backstage look at the show, from its creation in 2014 and its evolution as well as exploring the life of Hamilton himself. It might not be the filmed version of the show that so many left out in the cold had been hoping for (and it <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/oct/17/hamilton-america-review-documentary-lin-manuel-miranda-radicalmedia\">can be frustrating at times</a>), but those who are in love with the show will be delighted and entertained. <em>PBS, check local listings</em></p> <h2><strong>Returning shows</strong></h2> <p><strong><a href=\"http://m.cwtv.com/shows/crazy-ex-girlfriend/\">Crazy Ex-Girlfriend</a></strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2VF6iBIOWk\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/s2VF6iBIOWk?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>If you are one of the fans of this amazing show, you already know that it\u2019s coming back this week.

If you aren\u2019t watching Crazy Ex-Girlfriend already, you\u2019re missing out on the saga of a woman who quits her job in New York, moves to a dumpy town in California to chase after an ex-boyfriend and searches for her one chance at happiness. It is currently the best show on television. Season two moves its time slot to Friday nights and kicks off with (spoiler alert!) Rebecca and Josh back together. But will she be just as crazy in love as she was about finding it? I\u2019m sure there will be a delightfully campy musical number all about it. <em>The CW, Friday 21 October at 9pm ET</em></p> <p> <strong><a href=\"http://www.amc.com/shows/the-walking-dead\">The Walking Dead</a></strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SmUz88zoIg0\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/SmUz88zoIg0?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Who did big scary new villain Negan kill at the end of season six?

Absolutely nothing. He trades in Dr House for Dr Chance, a psychiatrist trying to help a patient (Gretchen Mol) in an abusive relationship. His assistance becomes more and more extreme and leads him into the San Francisco underworld. Yes, this is nothing like House. Alexandra Cunningham (Desperate Housewives) created the show along with Kem Nunn, based on his bestselling book of the same name. Hulu ordered two seasons right out of the gate, because they know the public service they\u2019re doing by keeping Laurie on our screens. <em>Hulu, Wednesday 19 October</em> </p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/title/70264888\">Black Mirror</a></strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-vAp9n8rQc\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/I-vAp9n8rQc?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>The UK import Black Mirror seems like it has already anticipated all sorts of dark turns where technology is taking us \u2013 and its third season, with an expanded six episodes, will continue to take us in the right direction.

Vice chairman Stanley Fischer said i<strong><a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/fischer20161017a.htm\">n a speech in New York</a></strong> there were three reasons to be concerned about low rates:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>First, and most worrying, is the possibility that low long-term interest rates are a signal that the economy\u2019s long-run growth prospects are dim...A second concern is that low interest rates make the economy more vulnerable to adverse shocks that can put it in a recession...And the third concern is that low interest rates may also threaten financial stability as some investors reach for yield and compressed net interest margins make it harder for some financial institutions to build up capital buffers...</p> <p>Those are three powerful reasons to prefer interest rates that are higher than current rates. But, of course, Fed interest rates are kept very low at the moment because of the need to maintain aggregate demand at levels that will support the attainment of our dual policy goals of maximum sustainable employment and price stability, defined as the rate of inflation in the price level of personal consumption expenditures.. being at our target level of 2 percent.</p> </blockquote> <p>He said there were a variety of factors holding down interest rates - including slow economic growth, low investment, a slowdown in the global economy - and they may continue to go so for some time.</p> <p>But he added economic policy could help offset these factors, and boost the economy\u2019s growth potential:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>While there is disagreement about what the most effective policies would be, some combination of more encouragement for private investment, improved public infrastructure, better education, and more effective regulation is likely to promote faster growth of productivity and living standards--and also to reduce the probability that the economy and, particularly, the central bank will in the future have to contend with the effective lower bound.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-10-17T17:09:00.287Z\">at 6.09pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5804f9b8e4b0cd26ff71e06f\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/helenasmith\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-17T16:21:50.588Z\">5.21pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Greek protestors as inspectors arrive</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Over in Greece thousands of leftwing protestors are demonstrating outside the Athens parliament as pressure mounts on the government to revoke unpopular reforms demanded by the country\u201ds creditors.

  "<p>The fertility rate in Germany has risen to a 33-year high in a sign the country has turned a corner after years of decline in the rate of births.</p> <p>In 2015 the fertility rate in Germany was 1.5 children per woman \u2013 56 newborns per 1,000 women more than in the previous year. The last time authorities recorded a similar rate was in 1982.</p> <p>No country in the world has had as prolonged a period of sub-1.5 fertility rates as Germany \u2013 a trend that dates back to 1975 in the former west of the country. In the old east, birthrates dropped off a cliff after reunification in the 1990s, leading to Germany being nicknamed \u201c<a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/a-land-without-children-why-won-t-germans-have-more-babies-a-779741.html\">the land without children</a>\u201d.</p> <p>Recent statistical findings show women in the country are having more children than those in Mediterranean countries such as <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://appsso.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/nui/show.do?dataset=demo_frate&amp;lang=en\">Greece, Italy or Spain</a>.</p> <p>The rate still falls short of the replacement rate of 2.1 children per woman. According to projections published last April, Germany\u2019s population is expected to decline by about 10 million people by 2060, meaning the country would be home to between 68 and 73 million inhabitants, compared with its current 81 million.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2016/jan/06/refugee-influx-helps-halt-decline-in-germanys-population\">Immigration was a key factor</a> in Germany\u2019s reversal of the declining rates of the 1990s. Among women with German citizenship, birthrates rose from 1.42 to just 1.43 in the years 2014 to 2015. For women with non-German citizenship based in Germany, however, rates in the same period rose from 1.86 to 1.95.</p> <p>But migration alone does not explain the current trend. Saxony, for example, has been the German state with the highest birthrate in the country since 2007, when the east of the country overtook the west in terms of children per woman, even though Saxony has one of the lowest rates of foreign-born inhabitants in the country. <br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/aug/23/baby-crisis-europe-brink-depopulation-disaster\">Europe needs many more babies to avert a population disaster</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In Berlin, where almost every third inhabitant has a multicultural background, the birthrate has flatlined over the past two years.</p> <p>According to Martin Bujard of the Federal Institute for Population Research, the most important driver in the recent trend reversal has been a series of childcare reforms. \u201cWhen it comes to childcare for the under-threes, eastern Germany always had a lot more to offer,\u201d he said. </p> <p>\u201cTripling the number of childcare places over the last 15 years has played a central role in allowing women to combine work and family, especially in the former west.

The irresponsibility of burdening shrinking future generations with debt is a frequently cited argument by German advocates of fiscal discipline, while concerns about demographic decline have changed the political discourse around immigration.</p> <p>\u201cGermany is in a better position than it was in the noughties, but only marginally so,\u201d said the economist Olga P\u00f6tsch of the Federal Statistical Office. \u201cBut we aren\u2019t going to magic away the baby boomers any time soon.\u201d </p> <p>In order to compensate for <a href=\"https://www.destatis.de/bevoelkerungspyramide/#!y=2016&amp;v=2\">low birthrates in the late 90s and early noughties</a>, P\u00f6tsch argued, Germany would require a birthrate of about 2.5 to 3 in order to avert future demographic imbalances.</p>",

She had not yet settled on voting for Clinton, but described the impact of the Trump tape as \u201cterrible\u201d.<br></p> <p>\u201cI think that Donald Trump is worse than anyone, so it\u2019s anyone but him.\u201d<br></p> <p>Laura Rexford, 37, offered a similar response. \u201cIf we condone what he\u2019s saying, what about that guy who raped an unconscious girl?\u201d she said, invoking the sexual assault of an unconscious woman by a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/jun/29/stanford-sex-assault-case-victim-blaming\">Stanford University swimmer</a> outside a fraternity house last year. \u201cDo Trump\u2019s comments make that OK?\u201d</p> <p>Rexford, too, is an independent who views neither major-party candidate favorably but said it would be wasting her vote not to cast a ballot for one of them. In spite of her trust issues with Clinton, she said she was beginning to lean toward her: \u201cI don\u2019t think he has the ability to be president.\u201d</p> <p>Following numerous shakeups in his campaign, Trump <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/17/donald-trump-stephen-bannon-breitbart-news-kellyanne-conway\">hired as his campaign manager Kellyanne Conway</a>, a Republican strategist whose background was heavy in its emphasis on helping the party communicate with female voters. Briefly, he showed signs of message discipline, bound mostly to a teleprompter in August and September, and embarking upon what his campaign described as outreach toward minorities.</p> <p>Republican operatives outside the Trump campaign said it was a shift in tone designed to make suburban women see past his inflammatory rhetoric and feel comfortable voting for him.<br></p> <p>But then came the tape. Dozens of Republican elected officials <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/08/donald-trump-list-of-republicans-reject-support-endorsement\">rescinded their endorsements of Trump</a>, with some even calling upon the nominee to step aside.<br></p> <p>The New Hampshire senator Kelly Ayotte, one of the more vulnerable Republicans facing re-election in November, was the first to withdraw her support for Trump after the tape emerged.<br></p> <p>But her opponent, the Democratic governor, Maggie Hassan, has cast Ayotte\u2019s decision to renounce Trump as one of \u201cpolitical calculation\u201d. \u201cShe stood by Donald Trump as he not only insulted women, but insulted a Gold Star family [who lost a son in the Iraq War], insulted people with disabilities,\u201d Hassan said on Wednesday after touring a pin manufacturing plant in Ayotte\u2019s hometown of Nashua.</p> <p>Hassan also seized upon Ayotte\u2019s response, in a debate just days before the release of the tape, when asked if Trump was a role model. After stumbling around her answer, Ayotte said he \u201cabsolutely\u201d was \u2013 a characterization she immediately retracted, but not before the damage had been done.</p> <p>Ayotte held her own conversation with reporters in Manchester on Wednesday, after attending a ceremony for fallen police officers. On a television screen behind her, an attack ad by Hassan tied her to Trump while featuring her \u201crole model\u201d comment.<br></p> <p>Ayotte, who spent much of the last year condemning Trump\u2019s statements, said she made the decision to revoke her support \u201cas a matter of principle\u201d. \u201cThat\u2019s more important to me than winning an election,\u201d the senator said.</p> <p>Clinton holds a five-point edge over Trump in New Hampshire based on <a href=\"http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/2016-new-hampshire-president-trump-vs-clinton\">the Huffington Post\u2019s pollster model</a>, which takes an average of publicly available surveys.</p> <p>A <a href=\"https://www.uml.edu/docs/TOPLINE%20-%20UMassLowell-7NEWS%20NH%20GENERAL%2020161013_tcm18-262711.pdf\">UMass Lowell/7 News poll</a> released in the wake of Trump\u2019s offensive tape found that more than four in five likely New Hampshire voters had either heard his comments or discussed them with others. While 66% said it did not make a difference, 30% said they were less likely to vote for Trump \u2013 with women more inclined than men to drop their support for the Republican nominee.<br></p> <p>Trump has spent the past week waging scorched earth warfare against the Republican lawmakers who spurned him, while also seeking to discredit the women who have accused him of sexual assault. He has also insulted the physical appearance of some of his accusers and questioned their motivations for coming forward now.</p> <p>While it\u2019s improbable that Trump\u2019s base would alone be enough to carry him over the finish line on 8 November, it may be all that he has.<br></p> <p>As dusk fell upon the historic downtown of Nashua, Jean and Lise Parent, a married couple, were wrapping up the day inside their property management office. The window was adorned with Halloween cobwebs and spiders and a sign in support of the Republican nominee: \u201cThe silent majority stands with Trump.\u201d<br></p> <p>\u201cIf a woman waits 30 years to come and say a story like that \u2026\u201d Lise, 69, said of the sexual assault allegations against Trump.<br></p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s bullshit,\u201d her husband Jean, 73, interjected.<br></p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s something wrong,\u201d Lise continued. \u201cShe\u2019s getting paid for it.

In February, Iowa held its caucuses, marking the traditional start to the primary process whereby each party chooses its candidate for president. Trump came second, losing to the Texas senator Ted Cruz. No one was very surprised. Cruz is a Christian conservative, and Iowa\u2019s Republicans often pick Christian conservatives. Trump was a thrice-married New Yorker more familiar with mammon than with God. But to Trump there could be only one explanation.</p> <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/694879900256354304\">\u201cTed Cruz didn\u2019t win Iowa, he stole it,\u201d</a> Trump tweeted. \u201cThat is why all of the polls were so wrong and why he got far more votes than anticipated. Bad!\u201d Forty-five minutes later, Trump <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/694890328273346560\">tweeted again</a>: \u201cBased on the fraud committed by Senator Ted Cruz during the Iowa Caucus, either a new election should take place or Cruz results nullified.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"ec3918044c146e5be6dbf464107176bfac0ad82d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ec3918044c146e5be6dbf464107176bfac0ad82d/0_0_1522_2048/743.jpg\" alt=\"Trump Taj Mahal in Atlantic City\" width=\"743\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018His assorted bankruptcies and collapses were never his fault\u2019 ... the Trump Taj Mahal in Atlantic City, New Jersey, one of the Republican candidate\u2019s many expensive failures.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ted Thai/Life Images Collection/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The basis of this claim was a release by the Cruz campaign falsely notifying Iowans that rival conservative candidate Ben Carson had dropped out of the race and urging Carson supporters to back Cruz instead. It might have been an innocent mistake or perhaps a dirty trick, typical of primary season. Either way, it was enough to allow Trump to claim he was robbed \u2013 and to give the US a glimpse of Trump\u2019s modus operandi. When he loses, he claims immediately that the game is rigged.</p> <p>He\u2019s doing it again now. His current stump speech alternates between claiming that the women accusing him of sexual assault were too unattractive for him to abuse and warning his supporters that the Democrats and the press are colluding to steal the presidency from him. As he <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/787699930718695425\">tweeted on Sunday</a>: \u201cThe election is absolutely being rigged by the dishonest and distorted media pushing Crooked Hillary \u2013 but also at many polling places \u2013 SAD.\u201d</p> <p>Some Democrats take a kind of perverse comfort in the fact that Trump is banging this drum again. It\u2019s a sure sign he thinks he\u2019s losing. (The last time he talked of ballot rigging was in August, when Hillary Clinton opened up a big lead.) It seems to be his way of getting his excuses in early, ensuring that no one brands him a loser on 9 November.</p> <p>Trump might also be laying the ground for a post-election career in which he sets himself up as the champion of a diehard Trumpian rump within the Republican party or perhaps as the head of a new media empire \u2013 Trump News Network \u2013 that will outflank Fox News on the hard right. Either way, he understands that there is no more potent variety of political rocketfuel than a righteous sense of grievance. Trump is priming those who are now crying \u201cLock her up!\u201d to bellow \u201cWe was robbed!\u201d</p> <p>But this comes at a cost that has made plenty of Americans \u2013 Republicans among them \u2013 anxious. Central to the self-image of the US is its status as a self-governing democracy. Election fraud is meant to be something that happens in other countries, with the US casting itself as monitor or even referee, determining which overseas ballots are free, fair and legitimate. Trump\u2019s claims, pre-emptively challenging the integrity of a presidential election, seek to upend that notion, challenging the legitimacy of America\u2019s own system. And they seem to be striking a chord: one survey released on Monday found that <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/10/poll-41-percent-of-voters-say-the-election-could-be-stolen-from-trump-229871\">41% of Americans</a> believe the election could be stolen from Trump.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e78ed80d246e2a53543c14062d086807c65ceab9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e78ed80d246e2a53543c14062d086807c65ceab9/0_0_4700_2918/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Trump supporter outside the CNN building in Hollywood, California\" width=\"1000\" height=\"621\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018If Trump wants to claim media bias in this election, he could make a strong case that the bias has been in his favour\u2019 \u2013 a Trump supporter outside the CNN building in Hollywood, California.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Frederic J Brown/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Despite the US\u2019s view of itself, this is not uncharted terrain. <a href=\"http://dailysignal.com/2016/08/08/rigged-election-a-history-of-presidential-candidates-whove-made-allegations/\">Claims of rigged contests have surfaced before</a>. In 1824, a narrow race was settled when the House of Representatives made John Quincy Adams president; partisans suspected behind-the-scenes dealmaking. In 1876, a similar dead heat left supporters of Samuel J Tilden furious when he won the popular vote but was denied the presidency thanks to the arcane mechanics of the electoral college. Amid allegations of multiple voting and shredded ballots, the incumbent president Ulysses Grant warned \u2013 in words that resonate today \u2013 that \u201ceither party can afford to be disappointed by the result, but the country cannot afford to have the result tainted by suspicion of illegal or false returns\u201d.</p> <p>More recently, some Republicans remained convinced that John F Kennedy was helped to his narrow victory over Richard Nixon in 1960 by ballot-tampering involving the mafia in Chicago, which helped him win the crucial state of Illinois. But what makes Trump\u2019s challenge different is that he is contesting the election before it has happened. This has made many fearful that the fury Trump is stoking could get out of control. They worry that, should the reality TV star lose, things could get violent. They point to the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SheriffClarke/status/787314656641712128\">tweet posted on Saturday by David Clarke Jr</a>, a vocal Trump supporter and the sheriff of Milwaukee county in Wisconsin. Alongside a picture of an angry mob wielding weapons, Clarke wrote: \u201cIt\u2019s incredible that our institutions of gov, WH, Congress, DOJ [Department of Justice], and big media are corrupt &amp; all we do is bitch. Pitchforks and torches time.\u201d In this climate, what if one crucial state is particularly close? Few have forgotten the photo-finish in Florida in 2000. How would such deadlock play out in this atmosphere?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c04b57b6ef6d89f47317acaf6fcbd0f80972eace\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c04b57b6ef6d89f47317acaf6fcbd0f80972eace/0_0_3072_1843/1000.jpg\" alt=\"John F Kennedy and Richard Nixon\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Some Republicans remained convinced that John F Kennedy was helped to his narrow victory over Richard Nixon in 1960 by ballot-tampering involving the mafia in Chicago.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ed Clark/Life Picture Collection/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Because this is the US, no talk of election rigging can be separated from race. When Trump tells mainly white crowds <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/10/01/trump-urges-supporters-to-monitor-polling-places-in-certain-areas/\">to spend election day monitoring voting</a> in areas other than their own \u201cbecause of you know what I\u2019m talking about\u201d, he is repeating, in the thinnest code, his accusation that Democrats will bulk up their vote by fraudulently inflating the numbers in African-American or other minority communities.</p> <p>The hint is certainly not lost on his supporters. Witness the words of one Trump enthusiast, a 61-year-old carpenter in the crucial battleground state of Ohio by the name of Steve Webb. \u201cTrump said to watch your precincts. I\u2019m going to go, for sure,\u201d he told the <a href=\"https://www.bostonglobe.com/news/politics/2016/10/15/donald-trump-warnings-conspiracy-rig-election-are-stoking-anger-among-his-followers/LcCY6e0QOcfH8VdeK9UdsM/story.html\">Boston Globe this weekend</a>. \u201cI\u2019ll look for ... well, it\u2019s called racial profiling. Mexicans. Syrians. People who can\u2019t speak American ... I\u2019m going to go right up behind them. I\u2019ll do everything legally. I want to see if they are accountable. I\u2019m not going to do anything illegal. I\u2019m going to make them a little bit nervous.\u201d</p> <p>It will comes as little surprise to those who have paid even the slightest attention to the post-truth campaign of Donald Trump that these claims of voter fraud and ballot rigging are almost entirely <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/13/boris-johnson-donald-trump-post-truth-politician\">fact-free and lacking in evidence</a>. One legal scholar dedicated years to studying the issue and could find only 31 cases of voter fraud out of more than a billion votes cast. As the ThinkProgress thinktank <a href=\"https://thinkprogress.org/donald-trump-claims-polling-places-are-rigged-12ba70beb551#.bk0wz8ix8\">has noted</a>: \u201cIowa\u2019s Republican secretary of state uncovered zero cases of voter impersonation at the polls during a two-year investigation.\u201d Even the <a href=\"http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/10/16/election-rigged-not/\">hard right Breitbart website</a> \u2013 so close to Trump that its boss, Steve Bannon, is the chief executive of the Trump campaign \u2013 had to admit that, \u201cgiven the sheer variety of jurisdictions that run a typical presidential election, the nationwide effect of voter fraud may be much harder to measure, and probably small\u201d.</p> <p>Conceding that point, Breitbart then attempted to redefine \u201crigged\u201d away from the mechanics of ballot-stuffing and the like and on to the terrain of media bias. If the election is being stolen from Trump, runs the argument, it\u2019s because the press is, in effect, acting as an ally of Clinton by being so hostile to the Republican nominee. Just look at the chorus of women assembled by the Washington Post, the New York Times, the Palm Beach Post and People magazine last week, all of whom alleged that had Trump sexually assaulted them. Surely that represents a coordinated attack, weeks before election day, designed to damage Trump and help Clinton?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5d4842ee22fdb6878bf26154efe5838a156fe99c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5d4842ee22fdb6878bf26154efe5838a156fe99c/0_0_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Trump supports at a Hillary Clinton event in Miami, Florida\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Trump supports at a Hillary Clinton event in Miami, Florida.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cristobal Herrera/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But it\u2019s a perilously thin argument, for the media all but created the Donald Trump candidacy. During the primary campaign, they lavished attention and airtime on him in a way that squeezed out all his rivals. He only had to pick up the phone to be on the air with Fox or MSNBC, a privilege not extended to Jeb Bush or Marco Rubio. His rallies were carried live and at length; theirs were lucky to get a 10-second clip. One study showed that while Bush spent tens of millions on TV ads, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/16/upshot/measuring-donald-trumps-mammoth-advantage-in-free-media.html\">Trump got $2bn-worth of airtime absolutely free</a>.</p> <p>But it was more than just quantity. The media allowed Trump to get away with lies they would have stamped on had Clinton been the culprit. For example, in recent weeks, Trump has been challenged on his wholly false claim to have opposed the invasion of Iraq. (At the time, he told shockjock Howard Stern on the record that he approved of it.) But, for many months, the supposedly liberal media, especially television, allowed him to get away with that fiction. If Trump wants to claim media bias in this election, he could make a strong case that the bias has been in his favour.</p> <p>The other limb of the \u201crigged\u201d argument is that the forces of Hillary have already fixed one contest this election season, corruptly engineering the Democratic primary race to defeat Bernie Sanders. There\u2019s no doubt that the rules \u2013 and the power given to party officials as \u201csuperdelegates\u201d \u2013 favoured Clinton, nor that Clinton had much of the party machine on her side. That\u2019s why Sanders, who wasn\u2019t even a Democrat a year before he sought the nomination \u2013 he sits in the Senate as an independent \u2013 was always the underdog. But even the most diligent hacking of Democrats\u2019 emails \u2013 undertaken, the FBI believes, by Russian intelligence and released in recent days by WikiLeaks \u2013 has not produced evidence that Sanders was defrauded of the nomination, rather than simply being outmuscled.</p> <p>Indeed, you could make a decent case that an attempt to rig the 2016 election is underway \u2013 one designed to hurt Clinton and help Trump. WikiLeaks would be a key exhibit in that case. Julian Assange has been consistent in leaking documents that embarrass the Democratic nominee, yet strangely reluctant to publish any paperwork that might discomfort Trump. You would have thought WikiLeaks might have been able to produce the elusive Trump tax returns, for example, but no luck.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8aefd75b63026831ca1f54e46a27b26d41dc5868\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8aefd75b63026831ca1f54e46a27b26d41dc5868/285_0_4087_2565/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Donald Trump\" width=\"1000\" height=\"628\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018During the primary campaign ... he only had to pick up the phone to be on the air with Fox or MSNBC.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris Pizzello/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>You would put the media in the dock, too, replaying all the softball interviews <a href=\"http://www.usnews.com/opinion/articles/2016-09-08/nbcs-matt-lauer-receives-bad-reviews-for-his-forum-with-clinton-and-trump\">Trump has been granted</a> \u2013 glossing over his multiple lies, his bankruptcies and his overt bigotries \u2013 while Clinton was grilled again and again over her use of a private email server. But your argument would not need to end there. You would also look at what\u2019s actually set to happen \u2013 and already happening \u2013 at the heart of the matter: the ballot itself.</p> <p>There is a mountain of evidence, going back years, of voter suppression: the deliberate exclusion of large groups of voters from the electoral rolls. <a href=\"http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/features/the-gops-stealth-war-against-voters-w435890\">Rolling Stone magazine has reported</a> on a programme designed to purge rolls of voters wrongly eligible to vote in more than one state. It sounds technical, but it just so happens that the programme \u201cdisproportionately threatens solid Democratic constituencies: young, black, Hispanic and Asian-American voters \u2013 with some of the biggest possible purges underway in Ohio and North Carolina, two crucial swing states with tight Senate races.\u201d</p> <p>Few have been more vigilant on this subject than <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ariberman\">Ari Berman</a>, the author of Give us the Ballot: the Struggle for Voting Rights in America. Every week, he brings word of another scheme by Republican authorities at state level \u2013 and, remember, Republicans are in charge in most of the 50 states \u2013 to suppress voting among those likely to vote Democratic. Recently, he reported on Wisconsin\u2019s failure to issue <a href=\"https://www.thenation.com/article/wisconsin-is-systematically-failing-to-provide-the-photo-ids-required-to-vote-in-november/\">voter-identification documents</a> to people who needed them, a failure that disproportionately affects black voters. Some of his revelations are <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AriBerman/status/785894221349650432\">jaw-dropping</a>, among them the story of an Indian-American woman, a US citizen since she was eight years old, who was told she had to spend $345 on naturalisation papers just to be able to exercise her right to vote.</p> <p>Every four years there are incidents like this, such as polling places in African-American areas with too few voting machines, causing long lines. Were that not enough of a deterrent to voting, this year \u2013 thanks to Trump\u2019s call for groups of vigilante polling monitors to take up their positions in urban areas \u2013 plenty of minority voters might well feel intimidated as well as simply put off.</p> <p>So, Democrats could cry foul if they wanted to. They have the recent memory of Florida 2000, when Republican state officials stood in the way of a thorough recount, ensuring that George W Bush held on to a razor-thin lead. They could also point to Ohio 2004, where questions linger <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/media/2005/11/recounting-ohio\">over Bush\u2019s defeat of John Kerry</a>.</p> <p>But most who cherish US democracy choose not to go there. They prefer to defend the integrity of the system. They know the peril that could befall the republic if nearly half the country believe the person occupying the White House is there fraudulently. Yet that is precisely the chaos Trump is seeking to create. He is proving that Donald Trump represents a threat to the stability of the US even if he loses. But we should remember: he never loses.</p>",

But when Rudd gave evidence to the committee in September, she just said that Goddard stood down because she was lonely. In the Commons <strong>Diane Abbott</strong>, the shadow home secretary, said this meant Rudd was open to \u201caccusations of misleading the committee\u201d. But Rudd said that Goddard strongly denied the allegations and that it would have been wrong for Rudd to have raised them with MPs. She said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I was asked [at the select committee] why Dame Lowell had gone. Dame Lowell had not spoken to me about her reasons, so I relied on the letter she had sent to the committee. In her letter she said she was lonely and felt that she could not deliver and that was why she stepped down. Dame Lowell has strongly refuted the allegations about her, and the only way we could understand properly why she resigned would be to hear from Dame Lowell herself. To echo any further allegations that are now likely to be the subject of legal dispute would have been entirely inappropriate. </p> </blockquote> <p>In response the Labour MP<strong> Lisa Nandy,</strong> who tabled the urgent question that led to Rudd addressing MPs, said Rudd\u2019s explanation was unsatisfactory. Nandy said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This inquiry was established to shine a spotlight on institutions characterized by a culture of secrecy, denial and cover-up in which child abusers were able to operate in plain sight without challenge or consequence. It is a tragedy that the inquiry itself has become dogged by complaints about the very problems it was designed to expose and that for survivors of abuse will be far too familiar. If it is to proceed with confidence the home secretary and the prime minister need to answer the very many questions over this inquiry starting with the truth surrounding the departure of Dame Lowell Goddard.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/oct/17/rowan-williams-stop-foot-dragging-over-calais-child-refugees\">Rowan Williams, the former archbishop of Canterbury, has warned that the safety of up to 400 unaccompanied children stranded in the Calais refugee camp is being put at risk by the government\u2019s \u201cfoot-dragging\u201d.</a></strong></li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>A Conservative councillor has been suspended by his local party after starting a petition to make opposing Brexit into an act of treason. </strong>As the Press Association reports, Guildford councillor Christian Holliday\u2019s petition for a change in the law to make supporting UK membership of the European Union a crime attracted more than 1,250 signatures within four days of being launched on the parliamentary website. </li> </ul> <p>That\u2019s all from me for today.</p> <p>Thanks for the comments.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5804ef14e4b0cd26ff71e03e\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-17T15:49:56.221Z\">4.49pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Jay announces new approach to child abuse inquiry to make it manageable</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here is more from<strong> Professor Alexis Jay</strong>\u2019s BBC interview about her review of how the child abuse inquiry operates. She has also put <a href=\"https://www.iicsa.org.uk/news/statement-chair\">a summary statement on the inquiry\u2019s website,</a> and<a href=\"https://www.iicsa.org.uk/key-documents/826/view/FINALChairStatement17Oct.pdf\"> a full statement here (pdf).</a></p> <p>Although she said she would not be reducing the scope of the inquiry, she has unveiled a new strategy designed to make it manageable. She said she hoped the inquiry would complete a \u201csignificant amount\u201d of its work by the end of 2020.</p> <p>The inquiry has been running 13 investigative strands, looking at child abuse within various institutions. In future it is going to focus more on four thematic strands. They are:</p> <ul> <li>Cultural - examining attitudes, behaviours and values within institutions. </li> </ul> <ul> <li>Structural - looking at the legislative, governance and organisational frameworks within and between institutions. </li> </ul> <ul> <li>Financial - considering the financial, funding and resource arrangements for institutions and services. </li> </ul> <ul> <li>Professional and political - focusing on leadership, professional and practice issues for those working or volunteering in relevant institutions. </li> </ul> <p>Jay said a traditional public inquiry approach to the allegations would fail.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I believe that the concerns that our terms of reference cannot be delivered are founded on an assumption that we must seek to replicate a traditional public inquiry in respect of each of the thousands of institutions that fall within our remit. We will do so for some, but we would never finish if we did it for all.</p> </blockquote> <p>Jay ordered a review of how the inquiry operates when she took over as chair in August. She said today her review was not yet complete, and that it would be finished by the end of November.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Today is about outlining the strategy I intend to pursue to make the inquiry manageable and deliverable in a specified timescale. If we were to pursue the traditional public hearing model that people associate with inquiries of this kind to the thousands and thousands of institutions in England and Wales, we would fail, so there\u2019s no possibility that we can do that.</p> </blockquote> <p>She said the four themes were \u201cabsolutely central to looking at institutions and their failings in the past, if any exist\u201d and that the inquiry would be holding public hearings related to the four themes. </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>For example, we might ask certain council leaders or police and crime commissioners to account publicly for what they\u2019ve done in relation to the subject of child sexual abuse within their areas of responsibility.</p> </blockquote> <p>Asked if her announcement was reducing the scope and scale of the inquiry, she replied:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It\u2019s certainly not reducing the terms of reference in the inquiry. We have no intention to propose that any aspect of the terms of reference is dropped. But we do intend to use different models and ways of working to deliver the terms of reference. In that respect we consider that we can complete a significant amount of the inquiry\u2019s work by the end of 2020.</p> </blockquote> <p>She said no decisions have been made about the 13 investigations. Asked if some of them could be cut, she said: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It really is impossible for me to say just now because it is quite a complex matter and we need to take the views of core participants and other relevant parties into account.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7ff666de51f68321cb486492f5c40b2a6786ce4b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7ff666de51f68321cb486492f5c40b2a6786ce4b/0_79_2889_1734/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Professor Alexis Jay.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Professor Alexis Jay.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dave Higgens/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5804ee0de4b0cd26ff71e038\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-17T15:29:23.773Z\">4.29pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Professor Alexis Jay</strong>, the new chair of the child abuse inquiry, has told the BBC that she will not seek \u201cany reduction or restriction\u201d in its scope,<a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-37680906\"> the BBC reports.</a></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5804eb73e4b005f21833a555\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/rowena-mason\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-17T15:23:51.220Z\">4.23pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">No 10 says it was not involved in decision to shut down Russia Today's UK bank accounts</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Two subjects dominated at the Downing Street afternoon lobby briefing.

Amazingly, there was even <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3840142/Fears-Hammond-quit-Cabinet-Chancellor-excluded-key-meetings-pressure-mounts-PM-hard-Brexit.html\">a story yesterday (which was denied) claiming that Philip Hammond, the chancellor, was on the verge of resignation because he was so fed up.</a></p> <p>The faultline is between those pushing for a hard version of Brexit (principally the so-called three Brexiteers, Boris Johnson, David Davis and Liam Fox) and the chancellor, who is urging caution. Today the Times and the Telegraph have both splashed with stories claiming Hammond has angered colleagues by expressing doubts about a plan to stop low-skilled EU migrants coming to the UK.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/suttonnick/status/787767310631174144\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Monday&#39;s Times front page:<br>Hammond clashes with Brexiteers on migrants<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/tomorrowspaperstoday?src=hash\">#tomorrowspaperstoday</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/bbcpapers?src=hash\">#bbcpapers</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/WnPOVPBSvd\">pic.twitter.com/WnPOVPBSvd</a></p>&mdash; Nick Sutton (@suttonnick) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/suttonnick/status/787767310631174144\">October 16, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/suttonnick/status/787762707441352704\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Monday&#39;s Telegraph front page:<br>Hammond in Cabinet Brexit row<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/tomorrowspaperstoday?src=hash\">#tomorrowspaperstoday</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/bbcpapers?src=hash\">#bbcpapers</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/Oep3E74oZo\">pic.twitter.com/Oep3E74oZo</a></p>&mdash; Nick Sutton (@suttonnick) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/suttonnick/status/787762707441352704\">October 16, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Here is the Guardian\u2019s account by<strong> Peter Walker.</strong></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/17/philip-hammonds-brexit-worries-point-to-cabinet-tensions\">Philip Hammond's Brexit worries point to cabinet tensions</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And here is how it starts.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The chancellor, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/philip-hammond\">Philip Hammond</a>, has angered more pro-Brexit cabinet colleagues with his concerns over plans to swiftly restrict immigration from the EU, warning this could harm the economy, according to reports.</p> <p>In a sign of apparent tensions within the cabinet over the balance between limiting immigration and keeping open access to the EU, unnamed cabinet sources briefed two newspapers about supposed worries over Hammond\u2019s stance.</p> <p>The chancellor is said to have used a meeting last week of Theresa May\u2019s cabinet Brexit committee to urge caution about a plan to force EU workers to show they have a guaranteed skilled job before they are allowed into Britain ...</p> <p>One unnamed cabinet source described Hammond as \u201coverly influenced by his Treasury officials who think it is a catastrophe that Britain voted to leave the EU\u201d,<a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/10/16/philip-hammond-in-cabinet-row-over-accusations-he-is-trying-to-u/\">the Telegraph reported</a>.</p> <p>Another source told the paper: \u201cHe is arguing from a very Treasury point of view. He is arguing like an accountant seeing the risk of everything rather than the opportunity.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>This morning <strong>Jeremy Hunt,</strong> the health secretary, was on the Today programme talking about maternity care and he got the chance. His response was ingenious (and not entirely wrong.) Cabinet ministers should be having vigorous arguments, he said. When it was put to him that this infighting was \u201cnot ideal\u201d, Hunt replied.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>On the contrary. If we weren\u2019t having lively debates in cabinet, you would be saying \u201cWhat\u2019s happened to cabinet government, why aren\u2019t you going through incredibly thoroughly all the different arguments to make sure we end up with the right decision?\u201d </p> <p>The British people changed the history of our country on the 23 June. The cabinet is absolutely united that we must respect that decision.</p> <p>But we need to then go through, very thoroughly and carefully, all the different options because we\u2019ve got to have a new immigration policy, a new trade policy, a new economic policy ....</p> </blockquote> <p>Hunt also rejected the suggestion that Hammond was trying to undermine Brexit. When this was put to him, he replied.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This isn\u2019t the first time in the history of government where you read reports in the newspapers that may not actually reflect what\u2019s happened. All I would say is that you would expect lively debates to be happening in government because we are going to get the right solution in terms of securing our borders, but also the right solution economically. </p> </blockquote> <p>Hunt is right to say ministers should be arguing through the policy options behind closed doors. That happens all the time in government. But what is significant about this row is that it has spilt out onto the front pages of the newspapers. When ministers start briefing against each other to the media, it becomes harder for them to act collectively when they do reach an agreed position.</p> <p>I will be covering more developments on this as the day goes on.</p> <p>Here is the agenda for the day.</p> <p><em>9.30am:</em> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/oct/17/maternity-wards-in-england-to-be-rated-by-safety-record\">Jeremy Hunt, the health secretary, gives a speech setting out plans to make maternity units safer.</a></p> <p><em>9.45am: </em>The court hearing about whether the government is entitled to invoke article 50 starting the EU withdrawal process without a vote in parliament resumes.</p> <p><em>10am:</em> Nick Clegg, the former Lib Dem leader and former deputy prime minister, gives a speech on the impact of Brexit on the food and drink industry.</p> <p><em>11am:</em> Number 10 lobby briefing.</p> <p><em>2.30pm:</em> Damian Green, the work and pensions secretary, takes questions in the Commons.</p> <p><em>4.30pm:</em> MPs begin a debate in Westminster Hall on Brexit.</p> <p><em>Afternoon:</em> Ukip\u2019s national executive committee meets to discuss the timetable for its leadership election.</p> <p>The chancellor, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/philip-hammond\">Philip Hammond</a>, has angered more pro-Brexit cabinet colleagues with his concerns over plans to swiftly restrict immigration from the EU, warning this could harm the economy, according to reports.</p> <p>As usual, I will be covering the breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web.

  "<p>From its highest point, the Georgian-era observatory at <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heaton_Park\" title=\"\">Heaton Park</a>, you can see the limits of the megacity that will be created by \u201cDevo Manc\u201d. Do a quick 180-degree panorama with your smartphone and you\u2019ll find that a metropolis of 2.8&#xa0;million people does not even fill the photograph.</p> <p>By 21st-century standards, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/public-leaders-network/2014/nov/03/devo-manc-powers-greater-manchester-mayor\" title=\"\">new Greater Manchester Combined Authority (GMCA) created by David Cameron\u2019s government in 2014</a> is too small. Yet compared with the city\u2019s political traditions, it is way too big. Even after two centuries of consolidation, it takes 10 local councils to run the place \u2013 two of them already titled \u201ccity\u201d.</p> <p>When they looked at the <a href=\"https://www.greatermanchester-ca.gov.uk/homepage/59/devolution\" title=\"\">strategic plan for Greater Manchester</a>, presented in 2014, many local people were struck by the same thought: there was scant provision for democracy. There will be an elected mayor \u2013 Labour\u2019s Andy Burnham is the odds-on favourite \u2013 and a committee formed of 10 elected council leaders. And that\u2019s it.</p> <p>When they scrutinised the 17 strategic objectives further, says local businessman David Fernandez-Arias, other flaws became obvious: \u201cIt\u2019s economy first, and the understandable belief that wealth trickles down if you get that right.\u201d There was a nod to the creation of \u201cgreen jobs\u201d, but no comprehensive environmental strategy. So, campaign groups across Greater Manchester decided to draw up a <a href=\"http://www.peoplesplangm.org.uk\" title=\"\">\u201cpeople\u2019s plan\u201d</a>. Its two objectives are to increase democratic control over the new mega-authority, and to broaden the strategy beyond economics.</p> <p>\u201cWe want to bend the strategy so that it ends up, instead of standing on one leg \u2013 the economy - it stands on four: social, environmental, economic and democratic,\u201d says Fernandez-Arias.</p> <p>At present, the People\u2019s Plan is at the design phase. There is an online form you can fill in to indicate your preferred choice of priorities in transport or social care provision. And there\u2019s a&#xa0;round of meetings scheduled. Based on that, a&#xa0;team including experts from Manchester Business School will put together a plan to be handed to the incoming mayor.</p> <p>But although Burnham is making sympathetic noises, the political culture of north-west England has been staunchly top-down for more than a century. In that culture, it was for councillors to decide and provide, the people to elect them and for the deep detail of what happens next to end up in the small print of newspapers that no longer exist.</p> <p>But the People\u2019s Plan is a good idea, and even the exercise of completing the campaign\u2019s brief questionnaire shows where it could lead. Do you focus investment on city transport grids or intercity ones? Do you want to spread new housing developments or put them in the town centres? Do you want a big local energy provider, or several small ones?</p> <p>Even for resource-neutral questions such as these, the existing local government structures of the UK exclude most people from the choice. So, in a way, by designing Devo Manc without an elected assembly, the Conservatives have opened up the possibility of a big democratic experiment from below.</p> <p>But it\u2019s on the big, money-heavy decisions that most people are focused. In 2017, the GMCA gets control of a combined health-and-social-care budget of \u00a36bn. The problem is that\u2019s \u00a32bn short of what it will need by 2020. Local health experts calculate about a third of the gap can be closed by central funding, leaving the rest to be plugged through \u201cproductivity\u201d and heroic improvements in public health.</p> <p>The irony is, by allowing communities, health unions and user groups to take control of the local health priorities, Greater Manchester would stand a better chance of achiveving the desired \u201cefficiencies\u201d: first by getting local buy in and second because the solutions would be more intelligently designed. Instead, on the point of assuming office, Burnham \u2013 former Health Secretary at Westminster \u2013 is going to be in a world of fiscal pain.</p> <p>The People\u2019s Plan \u2013 to work properly \u2013 needs its own resources. You need to build local communities\u2019 capacity to participate in democracy; not just in cold halls on rainy Novemember nights, but through online participation.</p> <p>In Madrid, where a coalition backed by the radical-left Podemos party governs, the mayor has earmarked \u20ac60m (\u00a354m) of spending as a&#xa0;\u201cparticipatory budget\u201d, <a href=\"https://decide.madrid.es/presupuestos-participativos-resultados\" title=\"\">to be decided through online polling</a>, with proposals submitted via local assemblies. In the latest round, \u20ac24m has been allocated on local projects as varied as a centre for people with Alzheimer\u2019s, municipal nurseries, tree planting and the restoration of fountains and urinals.</p> <p>What\u2019s striking about Madrid and the other left-controlled Spanish cities is the way local identities and the big metropolis can be made to fit together. The mass meetings where the mayor stands being questioned and occasionally harangued represent historic districts: small local government units the size of a real community.</p> <p>It\u2019s no accident that, when Manchester was the centre of the world economy, decision-making took place at the level of towns and parishes. Leigh, where I grew up, was created as a single borough only in 1899, out of three separate parish councils. That disappeared in 1972 to become part of Wigan, which will now be subsumed into the GMCA.</p> <p>Whoever becomes mayor will find, in the in-tray, requests for a big event to celebrate the Peterloo massacre, whose bicentenary falls in August 2019. Local activists are already thinking about period-costume parades from the 16 towns whose workers participated in the mass movement of 1819. But the best memorial to Peterloo would be to turn Manchester into the first UK city where participatory democracy is given money, time and space. The mayor\u2019s first act should be to scrap the strategic plan inherited from the Cameron era and throw its replacement open to a&#xa0;process of collaborative design.</p> <p>And he should \u2013 as in Madrid \u2013 allocate a significant portion of the city\u2019s budget to proposals suggested by and for the people, and decided by online voting. And not just Manchester. If the incoming Labour mayors can get it right, people\u2019s planning could transform the political culture of our towns and cities.</p>",

The owner is entitled to profit, and balks at spending minor amounts for repairs for their \u201cwhining tenants\u201d, even when the home is ankle-deep in water from a leak.

We need new strictly enforced legislation, so that errant rentiers forfeit the property and must pay damages when properties fall into such disrepair.</p> <p>It\u2019s also about education. Smaller non-institutional landlords should receive training about their responsibilities, such as the notion that proper maintenance cares for their investment, meaning tenants stay longer, thereby avoiding agency fees for finding new occupants when residents give up and leave.

The logical path, at least for a film with McGregor in the hot seat, would be to set the new movies between the end of 2005\u2019s Revenge of the Sith and 1977\u2019s Star Wars, a period in which Kenobi is ostensibly in exile on Tatooine, waiting to see if Luke Skywalker exhibits Jedi tendencies.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2016/oct/13/rogue-one-a-star-wars-story-video-trailer\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/57bxg\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2803048\"            data-video-name=\"Rogue One: A Star Wars Story \u2013\u00a0video trailer\"            data-video-provider=\"Lucasfilms\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57ff95bbe4b016012389568f\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/10/13/161013StarWarsRogueOneTrailer_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/10/13/161013StarWarsRogueOneTrailer_V3.webm\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/10/13/161013StarWarsRogueOneTrailer.m3u8\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2016/oct/13/rogue-one-a-star-wars-story-video-trailer\">Rogue One: A Star Wars Story \u2013 video trailer</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>The problem here is that the 19-year gap between the two trilogies \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2016/oct/13/rogue-one-a-star-wars-story-five-reasons-were-still-slightly-worried\">as Rogue One has been discovering</a> \u2013 is a tough period within which to set a Star Wars film. The Jedi are pretty much extinct, having been killed off by Darth Vader and others in an extended purge, and the Galactic Empire is at the height of its strength. Since it remains all-powerful by the time the events of Star Wars take place, any stories surrounding Kenobi would almost certainly need to spin-off into far corners of the galaxy where the actions of the exiled Jedi knight are in no danger of knocking the main narrative off its course. </p> <p>The new movies might reimagine our hero as a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kung_Fu_(TV_series)\">Kung Fu</a>-style wandering exile, travelling through the outer-rim planets and occasionally using his powers to help the local populace, though always with an awareness of the need to avoid attracting any unwanted Imperial attention. There are numerous examples in pop culture of iconic protagonists who have been successfully wrenched from familiar environments and thrown headlong into exotic landscapes, from the Marvel comic Planet Hulk (currently being half-inched for the movie Thor: Ragnarok) to the 2013 X-Men spin-off The Wolverine, in which the adamantium-clawed mutant visits Japan. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2016/oct/13/rogue-one-a-star-wars-story-five-reasons-were-still-slightly-worried\">Rogue One: A Star Wars Story \u2013\u00a0five reasons we're still slightly worried</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Alternately, Disney might borrow ideas from the Star Wars Expanded Universe \u2013 even though the studio declared pretty much all of it non-canonical in 2014. In the novel series Star Wars: The Last of the Jedi, Kenobi goes in search of a former Jedi apprentice, Ferus Olin, who survived the purge. He leaves Tatooine and travels to the troubled planet of Bellassa, where Olin is rumoured to be living. In the series of 10 novels, Olin eventually becomes an agent for Emperor Palpatine, though it emerges he is in fact a double agent, hoping for the chance to kill Darth Vader. The problem here, once again, is we already know the evil shiny-carapaced Sith Lord makes it through to the events of the original trilogy.</p> <p>The other issue might be Kenobi\u2019s suitability to lead his own movies. While the prequels presented a rather more swashbuckling take on the Jedi knight, there\u2019s a sense that he fits the role of a supporting character better, at least on the big screen. Rumour has it that Lucas based Qui-Gon Jinn\u2019s one-time apprentice on Gandalf from The Lord of the Rings, who was himself inspired by Merlin. Neither of those hairy old sorcerers have ever seemed prime candidates to lead their own blockbuster adventures, though the BBC did, of course, give us the early years of the mythical British wizard on the small screen a few years back.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c5ee175559908187c3944afd4d9ad44c1c0963a2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c5ee175559908187c3944afd4d9ad44c1c0963a2/0_189_3504_2102/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alec Guinness as Obi-Wan Kenobi in Star Wars: A New Hope.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alec Guinness as Obi-Wan Kenobi in Star Wars: A New Hope.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/LUCASFILM</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>McGregor\u2019s Kenobi would be a few years younger than his aged sorcerous forebears, most likely in his mid-40s: a Jedi knight in his prime, yet currently wasted living in a cave on Tatooine.

  "<p>Elizabeth Warren has long been calling for a federal probe into the short-term property rental industry \u2013 a shot aimed square at the upside-down-heart logo of Airbnb. This Tyrannosaurus Disruptus is swinging a $30bn tail through rental markets from Venice, California, to Venice, Italy. Now, people are starting to pay attention. <br></p> <p>Warren\u2019s call has been taken up by officials and civic leaders from a dozen US cities, who wrote a letter saying they want the Federal Trade Commission to take up the charge. It\u2019s about time. \u201cCities are struggling to address urgent shortages of affordable housing,\u201d the letter said, \u201cand there is evidence that commercial interests in the [short-term rental] industry are removing residential units from housing markets and thereby contributing to even higher rents.\u201d</p> <p>One of the best places to observe the impact of Airbnb is New Orleans, where next week the city council will vote on a bill to regulate the short-term rental industry. The industry has transformed neighborhoods throughout the Crescent City, and debate over the subject is intense, bordering on bloodsport. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/oct/13/airbnb-cities-urge-government-crackdown-elizabeth-warren\">Lawmakers join Elizabeth Warren's call for US to 'step in' on illegal Airbnb hotels</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In advance of the vote, Airbnb has unleashed a crude $1m local ad blitz attempting to humanize its business model. One of the 60-second commercials opens with a local Airbnb host named Reneia. \u201cI love rescuing animals,\u201d she says over <a href=\"https://www.airbnbaction.com/airbnb-in-new-orleans/\">images of her playing</a> with shelter dogs. \u201cAnd [hosting] gives me an additional income to help these animals.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s almost enough to make your question your support for regulation \u2013 \u201cDoes this mean I hate puppies?\u201d \u2013 but then you realize that owner-occupied rentals like Reneia\u2019s are not affected by the proposed regulations. The law narrowly targets rentals of entire unoccupied homes (which would be limited to 30 rental days a year). Reneia and her rescues would be just fine. </p> <p>A more fair Airbnb ad would profile absentee landlords and property managers laying on the beach or sitting at their desks. But their stories might leave audiences cold, and anyway the industry has no interest in reminding the public of these people. </p> <p>It is they, not the waitresses with spare rooms and rescue animals, who have generated widespread anger in New Orleans and other cities across the country. Airbnb\u2019s vast publicity machine is in fact geared toward obscuring the existence of the faceless commercial lessors who have fueled much of the company\u2019s rapid growth. </p> <p>I gained a front-row seat to this phenomenon when I moved to New Orleans in early 2013. Since then, I\u2019ve seen entire blocks in the Bywater neighborhood converted to short-term rentals, most operated by absentee landlords. Vacancies in the area are few; rents have gone up. Long-term neighbors have been replaced by flows of vacationing strangers. You can\u2019t blame Airbnb for all of this, but it\u2019s past due we figured out what damage the industry has done \u2013 and how to roll it back. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/oct/17/sharing-economy-capitalism-uber-airbnb-ownership\">New technology may soon resurrect the sharing economy in a very radical form</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This is what residents from across New Orleans have been calling for in recent protests like a <a href=\"http://www.nola.com/politics/index.ssf/2016/09/short_term_rental_demonstratio.html\">mock funeral</a> procession to city hall, featuring coffins marked \u201caffordable neighborhoods\u201d and \u201creal neighbors\u201d.</p> <p>But it\u2019s not just activists who are worried \u2013 public officials across the country have been slowly collecting binders of data on Airbnb\u2019s impact on cities. Two years ago, New York\u2019s attorney general office released a <a href=\"http://www.ag.ny.gov/pdfs/Airbnb%20report.pdf\">study</a> showing that commercial lessors operate a third of Airbnb rentals in the city, most in violation of zoning and tax law. </p> <p>And last year, the Los Angeles Alliance for a New Economy published a <a href=\"http://www.ag.ny.gov/pdfs/Airbnb%20report.pdf\">report </a>estimating that close to 90% of Airbnb\u2019s LA revenue was derived from absentee landlords and leasing companies.

I do not condone what they did, I may even hate what they did, but I do not hate them. You look at every despot you can think of, presidential candidates included.

I try to play around with the idea that another world is possible.</p> <p><strong>What kind of research did you do?</strong></p> <p>I wanted to see what my characters had seen and experience what they had experienced up to the point of what I could handle. I went to Sweden. I was in Germany, Korea, India, Las Vegas, France, Ireland, Scotland, so many places. The Dominican Republican, that was important, there\u2019s a tourist area where I was approached all the time because it was assumed on the beach that I must be a worker.

Maybe when the world stops exploiting all workers then we\u2019ll be able to have a more sane and balanced conversation about what engaging in sexual acts and getting paid for that looks like. For me, for today, when I came out of that window, I felt like if I had every choice in the world to do anything that I wanted to do, that would be very low on the list. It did not feel empowering to me. </p> <p>Are we ever going to be in a place where we can have healthy, self-determining pathways to commodifying sex? Maybe. It ain\u2019t happening right now. I\u2019m still looking for the woman who says, yes, all other things being in place, I don\u2019t have to do anything to pay my bills, I would still want to do this for a living because it\u2019s my calling. </p> <p><strong>And what do you hope audiences will do after they leave the show?</strong></p> <p>I\u2019m a red-blooded American woman. I\u2019ve watched porn. I\u2019m no different from anyone else. So I think it\u2019s about investigation and discovery for ourselves rather than preaching or soapboxes. It\u2019s about really honestly look at our own views. </p> <p>I\u2019ve started to live my life differently. I want to be careful about porn. I\u2019m not going to restrict anyone else for doing what they\u2019re doing, but now I think about who is in this movie and what is her actual experience? Is she having to take so many drugs to get through this experience that she\u2019s hurting herself? I don\u2019t know that for sure, but at least I think about it more carefully. </p>",
  "<p>A man accused of murdering an antiques dealer after plotting to steal a rare first edition of The Wind in the Willows has told a jury that an unnamed man used his laptop and mobile phone to make a list of robbery and kidnap targets that included celebrities and prominent business figures.</p> <p>Michael Danaher, 50, is accused of attacking and killing Adrian Greenwood at the latter\u2019s home in Oxford on 6 April, in an assault that left the rare-books dealer with more than 30 stab wounds. He denies murder.</p> <p>Oxford crown court previously heard that a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet entitled \u201cEnterprises\u201d, containing Greenwood\u2019s name and those of Kate Moss and Jeffrey Archer among others, was found on Danaher\u2019s laptop after the killing. Alongside the names were columns headed \u201cmodus\u201d and \u201cexpected take\u201d, and terms such as \u201cransom\u201d and \u201cstun\u201d.</p> <p>In addition, the court heard that Danaher\u2019s laptop and phone had been used to research the home addresses of other prominent figures, including Eamonn Holmes, Gary Lineker and Louise Redknapp.</p> <p>On Monday, Danaher, who is unemployed, denied he had drawn up the spreadsheet or carried out the web searches, instead blaming an unidentified man whom he said he would not name in court.</p> <p>The man would come and go from Danaher\u2019s Peterborough flat and use his laptop and mobile phone, the defendant told the jury. He said he had met the man in a pub in 2015, but that he would not say anything to help identify him. </p> <p>Asked why he would not name him, Danaher said he had been threatened in prison with \u201cconsequences\u201d for him and his family if he disclosed the man\u2019s identity.</p> <p>Danaher said it must have been this man who made the first celebrity search, for TV presenter Holmes\u2019s address, on 30 June 2015. \u201cThe only person it could have been was him,\u201d he told the court.</p> <p>Asked by Amjad Malik QC, defending, why some of the searches were in the early hours of the morning, Danaher said: \u201cHe must have come round then. He seemed to keep odd hours.\u201d</p> <p>Danaher told the jury that in December 2015 he had bought a stun gun online, disguised as a mobile phone, because he had been afraid of the man after catching sight of the Enterprises document on the screen of his own laptop.</p> <p>\u201cIt just looked like he was up to no good,\u201d he told the court. He said he had asked the man about the document but was told it was none of his business. \u201cHe said I would get fucking hurt if I said anything to anyone.\u201d</p> <p>Similarly, it was the other man, said Danaher, who had been driving his car and using his mobile on 22 March this year, when both were recorded in Hampstead, north London, near the home of the Wonga investor and Conservative donor Adrian Beecroft, whose name also appeared on the Enterprises list.</p> <p>The jury previously heard that a man attempted to force his way into the Beecroft family home that day but was foiled when the businessman\u2019s wife screamed for help. The prosecution says this man was Danaher.</p> <p>The accused told the court he had met Greenwood at an auction, perhaps in Henley, where he had gone to buy second hand books towards the end of 2015.</p> <p>Greenwood had \u201cpiqued [his] interest\u201d when he bought a crate of books, and the pair had got talking.</p> <p>Danaher said: \u201cHe seemed very sociable. A nice guy. I just thought he obviously knew far more about it [buying books] than I did. He obviously knew his stuff.\u201d</p> <p>Danaher said some of the searches on his phone and laptop, into Greenwood\u2019s addresses and business, had been made by him. This included multiple searches about The Wind in the Willows copy, which the jury heard Greenwood put on eBay in August 2015 for \u00a350,000. The prosecution previously accused Danaher of targeting Greenwood because of this book, and of listing it on the auction site on the evening of his death after stealing it from his flat.</p> <p>The defendant said he searched repeatedly for information about the dealer because he wanted to \u201clearn from him\u201d, and was \u201cjust looking to see how he was advertising things\u201d.</p> <p>Asked by Malik if he had written \u201ctosser\u201d alongside Greenwood\u2019s name in the Enterprises spreadsheet, he said: \u201cCertainly not. I thought he was a nice guy. I didn\u2019t have any problem with him at all.\u201d</p> <p>Danaher told the jury he had been severely overweight and about \u00a313,000 in debt in about March or April this year, after his marriage broke up in 2012 and he lost his job at an engines company in Peterborough.</p> <p>He had also been struggling mentally, he told the jury while fighting back tears, and had tried to kill himself. \u201cI thought the place might be better off without me,\u201d he said.</p> <p>When his attempt failed, he said: \u201cI thought I had better get myself in gear. It obviously wasn\u2019t meant to be. I needed to get back out and take another chance.\u201d</p> <p>The trial continues.</p>",

Over the coming weeks, if not months, the western-led coalition both on the ground and in the skies will almost certainly signal the end of Isis\u2019s control of territory in Iraq and will be the death knell of the so-called caliphate.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/17/iraqi-forces-begin-assault-on-isis-stronghold-mosul\">Mosul offensive: forces launch mass attack on Iraqi city in bid to oust Isis</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But what comes next? Iraq lacks the resources and the capacity to rebuild the towns and cities that have been destroyed since the campaign against Isis was launched two years ago. The Iraqi state is a fragile, if not failed, state and in some areas (including those outside Isis-controlled territory) it is no longer the principal provider of basic services and security.</p> <p>Iraq continues to suffer the consequences of corruption, sectarianism and dysfunctional governance, as well as a plethora of Shia militias and a highly fragmented security environment. In the coming period, the multi-phased operation to liberate Mosul will intensify. There are uncertainties surrounding the degree of resistance that Isis will provide. It is a largely opportunistic organisation that exploits and capitalises on the weaknesses of its opponents, using divisionary tactics to exhaust the resources of its opponents while shifting its focus to other areas.</p> <p>The group is unlikely to go head-to-head with Iraqi security forces and will almost certainly revert to insurgency mode and continue its fight in the urbanised environment that Mosul offers. That means it will blend into the local population, making it difficult to distinguish between the jihadi fighters and civilians.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2016/oct/17/mosul-battle-iraq-isis-islamic-state-peshmerga-latest\">Battle for Mosul: Isis city under attack from Iraqi and Kurdish forces \u2013 live news</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The strategy for liberating Mosul, much like the anti-Isis campaign more generally, is to clear areas of Isis fighters, maintain control over territory retaken from the group and rebuild the destroyed towns and cities. But who will do the rebuilding? Aside from Iraq\u2019s lack of resources to finance this rehabilitation, it also lacks a regular military that is capable, and that has the support of local populations to sustain control of territories captured from Isis.</p> <p>Arab Sunni tribal groups are expected to do most of the fighting in the city itself but these groups have their own rivalries and do not necessarily have support and legitimacy among locals in Mosul, particularly since they receive support and training from rival political factions in Iraq and external powers that are widely disdained by locals.</p> <p>The Mosul operation carries particular weight because the city\u2019s liberation would effectively signal the start of the \u201cday after Isis\u201d. There is an array of different powerful and heavily armed groups who have set upon Mosul and they have conflicting agendas and ambitions.

Iran also has a significant presence and backs Shia militias, who have threatened to wage a war against Turkey unless it withdraws its troops from Mosul. Turkey has stationed them there to contain groups like the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 party (PKK), which has fought the Turkish state for a series of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/06/what-about-our-human-rights-kurds-feel-force-turkeys-crackdown\">political and cultural rights for Turkey\u2019s Kurdish population</a>. The local Turkomen and Yazidi population have additionally formed their own militias under the patronage of local and foreign backers.</p> <p>In other words, the conditions that gave rise to Isis in the first place are still there and have been exacerbated, rather than alleviated, over the past two years since the jihadis took control of Mosul in 2014. While President Obama clearly does not want Isis (or rather the \u201ccaliphate\u201d) to outlive his presidency, there are no guarantees the US and the international community will continue their support and help to remedy these shortcomings, as well as mediate between rival factions.</p> <p>In the short- and medium-term, Isis will continue to commit terrorist atrocities such as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/06/iraqs-interior-minister-resigns-in-wake-of-baghdad-bomb-attack\">July bombing in Karrada</a> that killed close to 300 people, and it still has its apparatus in Syria as a launching pad for attacks and atrocities elsewhere.

  "<p>If anyone expected 24 June to mark the end of a bitter and acrimonious battle over Britain\u2019s place in Europe, they could not have been more wrong. </p> <p>The battle over Brexit is going strong and with recent briefings \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/17/philip-hammonds-brexit-worries-point-to-cabinet-tensions\">some from cabinet members themselves</a> \u2013 a somewhat poisonous atmosphere has emerged in parliament.</p> <p>Much of the focus is on last week\u2019s cabinet committee meeting about leaving the EU, when Theresa May and her chosen ministers (a balance of leave and remain supporters) discussed three papers on what happens next.</p> <p>The liveliest issue was unquestionably how far the prime minister would use the \u201cmandate\u201d of the Brexit vote to control Britain\u2019s borders, with Amber Rudd laying out the idea of a visa-entry scheme for highly skilled migrants as part of a free movement report.</p> <p>Pitched against the home secretary was the chancellor, Philip Hammond, whose decision to urge caution landed him on the sharp end of criticism from some Brexiters who say he is trying to stall the process. </p> <p>Had this script been written months ago, we would not have been able to predict the individuals taking on the key roles. </p> <p>The idea that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/jun/09/eu-referendum-boris-johnson-v-nicola-sturgeon-in-itv-debate-live\">tub-thumping, pro-remain Rudd</a>, whose strength of enthusiasm for staying in the EU made her a Tory rarity during the referendum campaign, would be spearheading the fight for immigration controls would have been bemusing.</p> <p>Equally unlikely would have been the sight of Hammond \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/jul/15/philip-hammond-eurosceptic-foreign-secretary\">considered a staunch Eurosceptic</a> by his own party just two years ago \u2013 banging the drum for a soft Brexit in which economic considerations trump a free-movement clampdown.</p> <p>Brexiters think the chancellor went soft during his time in the pro-European Foreign Office, with leave campaigners dubbing him \u201cEuroPhil\u201d during the referendum.</p> <p>But according to civil servants involved in the process, the arguments are more defined by the departments that the individuals are defending rather than their personal views. </p> <p>To put it crudely, Hammond, as chancellor, will be judged on Britain\u2019s economic performance, while Rudd will have her feet held to the fire over migration numbers. And the battle is raging because so much is still up for grabs.</p> <p>People have been quick to label as a hard Brexit move May\u2019s promise that the UK will have immigration controls and not be under the jurisdiction of the European court of justice.<br></p> <p>But the truth is that, beyond the fact of an EU exit, things are not black and white, but a mass of grey in which economic and free-movement factors could alter dramatically ahead of and during negotiations.</p> <p>The Guardian understands that Rudd\u2019s work permit idea is not the only option on the table regarding migration controls. Other ideas being mooted in Europe by experts such as the Tory MEP Vicky Ford, who heads an influential Brussels committee on the single market, include an upper break on numbers, or a registration system for EU nationals. </p> <p>Ford believes the EU 27 would still be open to close economic ties under such a system, and suggests that Britain could also consider checking migrants\u2019 criminal records before they arrive without ruffling too many feathers. </p> <p>The Guardian has also been told that the issue of whether Britain should remain a member of the customs union \u2013 inside which EU countries negotiate trade deals collectively and set uniform external tariffs \u2013 is still up in the air. </p> <p>Although Liam Fox has suggested the UK will have to leave the customs union (perhaps to ensure his job as trade secretary remains viable), ministers did discuss a paper on the pros and cons of the issue last week, with some warning that the administrative costs of leaving could be huge. </p> <p>Even David Davis\u2019s new adviser, Raoul Ruparel, who believes an EU exit will mean leaving the free trade bloc, has admitted it could inflict a permanent cost of \u00a325bn on the UK\u2019s GDP. </p> <p>The arguments are dripping out of departments and into the media. </p> <p>Some senior figures have suggested Davis needs to choose his words more carefully, and be acutely aware of the impact that every twist and turn has on the financial markets. Others have said Hammond is guilty of talking down the economy. </p> <p>Friends of the chancellor have hit back, however, suggesting it is in his DNA to proceed with caution. After all, what\u2019s wrong with the chancellor acting like an accountant?</p> <p>Whatever the rights and wrongs of the Brexit debate, one thing is clear: May\u2019s promise of \u201cno running commentary\u201d will be impossible to fulfil.</p>",
  "<p>Some time in the not too distant future, perhaps weeks, perhaps months, Islamic State will almost certainly be forced to relinquish Mosul, the second city of Iraq and the seat of the caliphate it declared more than two years ago.

Its recapture may widen faultlines between these communities, rather than heal them.

Many analysts and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/27/isis-sustained-vulnerability-us-europe-intelligence-warning\">officials predict a spike in attacks</a>, particularly in Europe. Some of these, analysts predict, will be carried out by trained and commissioned extremists which the group will unleash as it is forced out of its final redoubts.

They point out territorial losses mean no tax, oil or other revenue streams, and no space for training, resting or preparing elaborate and effective propaganda. They say Isis 2.0 will be a shadow of its former self: a threat certainly, but one which will steadily weaken as time passes. A precedent here is the fate of al-Qaida once it had been forced from Afghanistan. By 2009, even with a safe haven in parts of Pakistan, the organisation was a shadow of its former self.</p> \n<p> The pessimists point out Isis, in previous incarnations, survived from about 2007 to 2014 in Iraq <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/blog/markaz/2016/08/09/dont-celebrate-isis-setbacks-too-soon/\">without ever controlling significant amounts of territory</a>, and eventually emerged to conduct the single most effective Islamic extremist military campaign seen anywhere in the world for many decades. They predict a long-running campaign mixing terrorism and insurgency lasting many years, which will range across much of the Islamic world and will be fuelled by the continuing political instability in key states as well as rivalry with other militant groups. </p> \n<p>They argue the group\u2019s ability to build a new state and declare a restored caliphate will be an inspiration to both aspirant and current Islamic extremists in a \u201cterrorist diaspora\u201d for decades even if the project did not endure, and that the setbacks of recent months can be explained as trials sent to test the faithful. </p> \n<p>The truth is no one knows.

The BCD regime failed to comply with such principles in the period prior to its avowal in November 2015, and the institution of a more adequate system of supervision as at the same date,\u201d the ruling concluded.</p> <p>The ruling comes as the House of Lords is debating the final stages of the investigatory powers bill \u2013 the snooper\u2019s charter \u2013 which will put the security services\u2019 mass digital surveillance on a clear legal footing for the first time. </p> <p>Diane Abbott, the shadow home secretary, said the ruling was \u201ca sharp reminder\u201d that the \u201cdraconian bill\u201d \u2013 which Labour has abstained on so far \u2013 needed amending to ensure that surveillance powers should not be lightly handed over to the security services without greater accountability.</p> <p>The investigatory powers bill will put mass digital surveillance activities on a clear legal footing for the first time since Snowden\u2019s disclosure.</p> <p>Chaired by Mr Justice Burton, the IPT ruling revealed that security agency staff had been sent internal warnings not to use the databases containing the vast collections of information to search for or access details \u201cabout other members of staff, neighbours, friends, acquaintances, family members and public figures\u201d.</p> <p>It also revealed concerns within the security agencies about the secretive nature of their bulk data collection activities.</p> <p>In February 2010, a Mr Hannigan, then of the Cabinet Office, wrote: \u201cIt is difficult to assess the extent to which the public is aware of agencies\u2019 holding and exploiting in-house personal bulk datasets, including data on individuals of no intelligence interest \u2026 Although existing legislation allows companies and UK government departments to share personal data with the agencies if necessary in the interests of national security, the extent to which this sharing takes place may not be evident to the public.\u201d It is not clear from the ruling if this is Robert Hannigan, who went on to run surveillance agency GCHQ from 2014.<br></p> <p>The campaign group Privacy International said the ruling showed that despite this warning internal oversight failed to prevent the highly sensitive databases being treated like Facebook to check on birthdays, and \u201cvery worryingly\u201d on family members for \u201cpersonal reasons\u201d.</p> <p>The IPT ruling included the disclosure from an unpublished 2010 MI5 policy statement that the BPDs included material on the nation\u2019s personal financial activities. \u201cThe fact that the service holds bulk financial, albeit anonymised, data is assessed to be a high corporate risk, since there is no public expectation that the service will hold or have access to this data in bulk. Were it to become widely known that the service held this data, the media response would most likely be unfavourable and probably inaccurate,\u201d it said.<br></p> <p>The legal challenge centred on the acquisition, use, retention and disclosure by the security services of BCD under section 94 of the Telecommunications Act 1984 and the use of BPDs under a variety of legal powers. The tribunal noted the highly secretive nature of the communications data regime, saying \u201cit seems difficult to conclude that the use of BCD was foreseeable by the public when it was not explained to parliament\u201d.<br></p> <p>Mark Scott, of Bhatt Murphy Solicitors, who was instructed by Privacy International in the legal challenge, said: \u201cThis judgment confirms that for over a decade UK security services unlawfully concealed both the extent of their surveillance capabilities and that innocent people across the country have been spied upon.\u201d</p> <p>Millie Graham Wood, legal officer at Privacy International, said: \u201c[The ruling is] a long overdue indictment of UK surveillance agencies riding roughshod over our democracy and secretly spying on a massive scale.\u201d</p> <p>She said the use of BCD carried huge risks. \u201cIt facilitates the almost instantaneous cataloguing of entire populations\u2019 personal data. It is unacceptable that it is only through litigation by a charity that we have learnt the extent of these powers and how they are used. </p> <p>\u201cThe public and parliament deserve an explanation as to why everyone\u2019s data was collected for over a decade without oversight in place and confirmation that unlawfully obtained personal data will be destroyed.\u201d<br></p> <p>Privacy International said the judgment did not specify whether the unlawfully obtained, sensitive personal data would be deleted.</p> <p>A government spokesperson said the ruling showed that the regimes used to hold and collect data since March and November 2015 respectively were legal.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/undercover-with-paul-lewis-and-rob-evans/2016/oct/05/duwayne-brooks-ricky-tomlinson-and-lisa-jones-to-tell-how-police-spied-on-them\">Duwayne Brooks, Ricky Tomlinson,  and Lisa Jones to tell how police spied on them</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThe powers available to the security and intelligence agencies play a vital role in protecting the UK and its citizens.

Royalists praised his more than 4,000 projects that helped to improve the lives of many Thais over the seven decades of his reign. Most Thais have known no other monarch than Bhumibol.</p> <p>Decades of media exposure to positive stores about the king also means royalists are convinced that he was like a walking angel, and venerate him as a semi-divine figure. Tears and the extreme public display of grief by royalist Thais over the past few days around the Grand Palace in Bangkok<a href=\"http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/general/1111332/royal-urn-viewing-in-15-days\" title=\"\"> where the king\u2019s body lies</a>, and elsewhere, are genuine. Some wish they could die, instead of their beloved monarch. Others pray they could continue to be his loyal subjects through an endless cycle of reincarnation.</p> <p>Strictly speaking, there is no god in Buddhism, which is the religion of the vast majority of the near-70 million Thais. Perhaps many were longing for the comfort of having a god-like figure that is perfect and beyond doubt. Thus anyone, particularly Thai, who casts doubt on this idealised relationship between the king and his loyal subjects are regarded as unpatriotic and ungrateful. To them, to be Thai is to be loyal to the king.</p> <p>However, Thailand in the 21st century is, in reality, a pluralistic society. That means it\u2019s impossible to expect all Thais to share the same royalist ideology. The struggle to break the hegemony on what constitutes Thai identity has been going on since the time of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_insurgency_in_Thailand\" title=\"\">communist insurgency</a> during the cold war. Liberal ideology has taken root among Thais, some of whom want to see the monarchy become more transparent and subject to scrutiny, alongside traditional royalism. It would be inaccurate to regard all Thais as royalists. Beyond the genuine grief expressed by the hundreds of thousands who have been paying their last respects, life goes on almost as normal for many.</p> <p>Those who stepped over the line by criticising or defaming the monarch, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/aug/07/man-jailed-for-30-years-in-thailand-for-insulting-the-monarchy-on-facebook\" title=\"\">violating the draconian l\u00e8se majest\u00e9 law</a>, face heavy punishment, with the maximum penalty being 15 years in prison.

In fact, there were many topics that were too dangerous to broach \u2013 that was just one of them. The red flags had been popping up all over the place. A healthy person doesn\u2019t snap at someone for chewing too loudly or too fast. Getting your hand slapped for trying to show a funny YouTube clip isn\u2019t normal. And being in debt shouldn\u2019t result in bruises.

He violently shoved me and then acted like he didn\u2019t mean it and that it couldn\u2019t have hurt. Moments later he did it again. Nearly yanking my arm out of the socket, he threw me down the hallway. </p> <p>I yelled at him that I would tell everyone, surely someone in the building had heard. He said it wasn\u2019t a big deal and somehow convinced me that I had concocted the story in the midst of a panic attack. Being in this relationship was hard, and debt made it all the more difficult. </p> <p>I had accrued over $85,000 in debt over the course of six years. Around $5,000 of that was credit card debt, and the rest was entirely education debt from undergraduate and graduate school. I had scholarships, but they barely scratched the surface of reducing the financial burden. </p> <p>He was from Europe and didn\u2019t have to pay a dime for his undergraduate degree. But I couldn\u2019t talk about my debt because my boyfriend would berate me for going to college when I didn\u2019t have the money to pay for it outright. He would yell and blame everything on me and my financial instability. That\u2019s when I created filters to block emails from my student loans and credit cards, because my economic woes were too dangerous a topic to risk breaching.</p> <p>One of the worst fights broke out when I purchased tomatoes from a slightly more expensive store than the one he told me to go to.

The Republican presidential nominee furthered the charge, tweeting: \u201cThe election is absolutely being rigged by the dishonest and distorted media pushing Crooked Hillary \u2013 but also at many polling places \u2013 SAD.\u201d Such comments have raised the prospect that Trump will not concede if he loses in November, although his running mate, Mike Pence, said his party would accept the result.

The place is the most important thing in my writing - it always started with the place. Even when I'm writing about objects, it's important. My favourite quotation, from a Finnish writer for a change, by Pentti Saarikoski, he said &quot;I'm not writing about the world and its places, I'm writing about the places and its worlds&quot; \u2013 or something similar. And when I studied literature, my topic was literature and the place, and the local, the place where you are, has always been the most important thing in the writing. There's an interesting question by Bruno Latour who asks where the local goes out to be global - it's two different levels of existence. And I try to establish a place, a here and a now. What I like in literature is this, but before I could articulate that, I just felt it. </p> <p>I read Kundera, and Knut Hamsen at the same time. Kundera is a classic postmodernist writer, he moves his character about; Hamsen is all about presence, no reflection, and I knew that was my preference. For me, all the reflections in my prose, is kind of a failure - it's the lack of ability to express it through flesh and blood and place. That's what I really want to do. That's what evokes the fantasy, and the writing itself - seeing a place. </p> <p>It's interesting in regard to what we were taught in the beginning of the 90s at university, when it was all about language, and we looked at realistic novels and the notion of the language being transparent - if you read Flaubert you can see the town - it was seen as completely naive. It was about language and science, and this was a postmodernist time. I loved that, I dived into it - I love the feeling that my teacher was a quantum mechanic, and it had that feeling to reading the letters in that way. But then I went back to childhood reading experiences, all about visualisation, and feelings. And that's what I'm doing. And yes, it's naive too.</p></div> </div> </div>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5804bd5fe4b08feb7300a417\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-17T12:00:50.652Z\">1.00pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">'I don't like myself'</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/16832157\">Nicole R </a>asks:</p> <p><em>In the beginning of the first book in the \u201cMy Struggle\u201d series, you become very upset when your parents invalidate the \u201cface\u201d in the sea you saw on television.

For me personally, it's such a big part of my personality, that my father did that all the time. In the end, it was like something was broken. Because as a child, the most important thing is to be accepted and loved, and if you're criticised you know something is wrong with you - it could be a dangerous thing, because it has to do with your self-esteem, and whether you like yourself, which I don't. Then you get children yourself, and you see it's so easy to do that. It's easy to see them as children - it's very easy to transfer the same feeling to them, and not understand the consequences. It's a constant thing in my life - trying to understand how they're feeling. You could make a joke about them, but it could crush them. Their feelings are much more connected to the world than mine are as an adult - I've learned to deal with things, and they haven't yet. </p> <p>I don't like myself, no - that must be somehow rooted in my childhood experiences. I'm not blaming anyone, but yes, it comes from there I think.

I'm currently writing a film manuscript of my first novel. I never re-read them, but I had to read this one. The first one's first 190 pages are excellent, and the last 510 pages are written by a writer in love with himself and his own writing. And the strange thing is a colleague of mine told me that when the book was published, that the first bit was good and then it was terrible... when it was published in English, I could have taken out the bad parts, but I like the fact that it is what it is, and it reflects something. The second novel I've never re-read, I don't have the courage to do that.</p> <p>My own favourite novels are classical novels in a way. I would love to do that, of course. But for me, I can't write novels. Thomas Mann said a novelist is a person who can't really write novels, and the novel is in that struggle. I think James Joyce could write perfect short stories, but his first novel, it's struggling with the form - and it's a celebration of that. </p> <p>I would like to write one, still. An example would be Never Let Me Go - a traditional novel in a way, but it has to be unique in some way or another.</p></div> </div> </div>  </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-10-17T13:30:44.572Z\">at 2.30pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5804bc95e4b0e0a93db99670\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-17T11:57:39.252Z\">12.57pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/4335007\">marukun </a>asks: </p> <p><em>Do Norwegian people really drink as much alcohol as described in your books?

It's all based on memory, not documents.</p> <p>I always wanted to write a book that moves effortlessly in time and space, and you're part of a wave that goes down and up, left and right. The first book I read that had this quality is Marcel Proust, In Search of Lost Time. He is using metaphor of moving, changing levels. He has a metaphor, then a pocket of something else comes in, and in that pocket could be the future or past. The opera, with all the people in dresses going there, and it changes into an underwater world. It's not just a metaphor though. I was reading that when I was 35 or something, and I couldn't write myself - I couldn't write anything. And then two years later I could, I was writing 700 pages in a row, and it's connected to Proust - it's so influenced by it. But I didn't know that at the time. I'm interested in having a feeling of movement. If you listen to music there are no paragraphs, no chapters, it's just flowing, it can go from emotional and warm to something abstract and hard, and it's the same movement, the same journey. That's an aesthetic ideal I have - I've never managed it, but I like the idea. </p> <p>I just read an art historian, a critic who wrote a book about Edvard Munch, he gave a definition of style, and said it was a way of controlling information. If you are a painter there can be endless details - there has to be a way to stop. That's style.</p></div> </div> </div>  </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-10-17T11:50:16.879Z\">at 12.50pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5804b947e4b04312166ed6fc\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-17T11:43:31.570Z\">12.43pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/15890036\">DavidFlynn</a> asks: </p> <p>Can you clarify the relationship between fact and fiction in the My Struggle series?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-comment\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/live/2016/oct/13/karl-ove-knausgaard-webchat-some-rain-must-fall-my-struggle#comment-85613138\">  <div class=\"d2-comment-embedded\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Comment\"> <div class=\"d2-left-col\"> <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/16837940\" title=\"View KarlOveKnausgaard\u2019s profile\"> <img class=\"d2-avatar\" src=\"https://avatar.guim.co.uk/user/16837940\" height=\"40\" width=\"40\" alt=\"User avatar for KarlOveKnausgaard\"> </a> <span class=\"d2-badge d2-badge-contributor d2-hidetext\" title=\"Guardian contributor\" itemprop=\"jobTitle\">Guardian contributor</span> </div> <div class=\"d2-right-col\"> <div itemscope itemprop=\"author\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"> <a class=\"d2-username\" href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/16837940\" title=\"View KarlOveKnausgaard\u2019s profile\" itemprop=\"url\"> <span itemprop=\"givenName\">KarlOveKnausgaard</span> </a> </div> <div class=\"d2-permalink\"> <a class=\"d2-datetime\" href=\"https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/85613138\" title=\"Link to this comment\" itemprop=\"datePublished\">17 October 2016 12:35pm</a> </div> <div class=\"d2-body\" itemprop=\"text\"><p>When I started out, the thing is that this is a book about the past. About what I remember, what's inside my head. So all the things I'm writing about, I have memories of, but I never know if the memories are accurate or not. It's a very subjective book, and it's also about what it is to remember. And when you go back to something you remember, the distinction between what it was and how you remember are blurred, so in the childhood book, book three, my method was to enter the memories, visualise them, and set them into motion. One memory, I do remember, but I don't know what led up to it or afterwards, and those things are invented. Dramatising memory, that's the thing. But I do try to keep it as it was - but the details are invented. But I do remember the colour of the chair - but I don't remember a car passing. The dialogue is invented of course, but I had a sense of what I could have said, or my friends - that's why I call it a novel, and it's told in the language of a novel. I wanted the effect of a diary, where you are attached to the person.

For the first time you wrote freely without thinking of what people would think about me, that was like walking into hell, and it was the worst thing for me to write, knowing that people would hate me for writing it. But it also felt extremely liberating. I can now do that in my writing, it's fine to publish controversial stuff or stuff that people will hate. But in a social setting it's still the same - I'm still desperate to be liked. When I do an event, I do anything to please the audience. It's horrifying - I can't control it. I'm so afraid of being disliked, and there I am, talking about myself for an hour. </p> <p>But another thing that happened was that I separated myself between me and what's out there in the media - I don't read it, and I know it's a cartoon, a character, it's impossible to identify with it.

But my normal routine is that I just write and the book is done, but since the first book it has been very little editing. There are of course remarks... I start my day by reading the day before, edit, and continue to write. It's much more a matter of: if it's not working, I remove it, and write it again. It's very different when it comes to journalism, I've been working with American editors and that's a different story - that's hard work for two weeks on a piece. Very detailed, shaping and reshaping all the time - it's like making a sculpture. I love that - they're so professional, and sensitive to the text. The difference is my own writing is more personal and more like as it appears - it would be wrong to change it too much. I'm not interested in constructing something - I'm more interested in the flow. The writing itself is editing - it's working, it's working, then it's not, and I take it out.</p> <p>The Aesthetics of a Broken Nose, by Geir Angell Oygarden - it's really such a brilliant book, and it is completely original, in its thinking and in its method.

I read it when I was 10, and I re-read it a few years ago, and still find it as compelling and great as it was then. It felt like it had such a depth to it, in such a simple way - and is very adventurous. I find something of same in Borges and Calvino, and I always loved that fantastic literature. It's still as brilliant.</p> <p>When I was a teenager I discovered Salman Rushdie, Midnight's Children especially, and my first writing was very much inspired by him - I found his writing so rich, and expanding everything. That was a new concept to me. He added something to world, rather than the condition I come from is taking something away from it; minimalism. This was maximalism - that was very important for me. I still regard The Satanic Verses as a modern classic, a really truly great book in all senses.</p> <p>Then in my 20s I read Ulverton by Adam Thorpe, which was an amazing reading experience, how he managed to capture time and passing of time, of changing cultures. He opened up possibilities in thinking about what a novel could do, for me. And at the same time I read Ian McEwan and his book A Child of Time, not his most well known but a direct influence for me in my first novel. ONe of the subjects is regression and when I read that it was like the last piece of what I was going to do came into place. I owe that book a lot. </p> <p>And I'm reading Rachel Cusk, Outline. I read Life's Work by her, which is brilliant, and Outline is outstanding. She's one of the best writers at the moment, what I've read of her. I've got a feeling there's something new in there. </p> <p>And classics: Dracula by Bram Stoker. I've read it twenty times. I really want to write that book! And another book that I think I should write, but I don't have to because it's written - I think about it every other week. Never Let Me Go by Ishiguro - it has something magical about it. It's absolutely fantastic.</p></div> </div> </div>  </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-10-17T13:28:02.126Z\">at 2.28pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57fcde5fe4b03b22b4fb2401\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-13T08:50:16.493Z\">9.50am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Post your questions for Karl Ove Knausgaard</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>One of the most powerfully honest \u2013 or to its critics, profoundly narcissistic \u2013 literary projects of recent years has been Karl Ove Knausgaard\u2019s My Struggle, a six-book autobiography that charts the Norwegian writer\u2019s personal trials and tribulations.

  "<p>The mother of a British conspiracy theorist who died suddenly in Poland has said she fears he was murdered.</p> <p>Max Spiers, 39, was visiting the eastern European country to give a talk but was found dead on a sofa days after she says he texted her to say: \u201cYour boy\u2019s in trouble. If anything happens to me, investigate.\u201d <br></p> <p>Vanessa Bates, 63, said the Polish authorities told her her son died in July of natural causes but no postmortem examination was carried out. </p> <p>\u201cI think Max had been digging in some dark places and I fear that somebody wanted him dead,\u201d she said. \u201cMax was a very fit man who was in good health and yet he apparently just died suddenly on a sofa.\u201d</p> <p>Spiers, a ufologist and paranormal researcher originally from Canterbury in Kent, claimed to have been the victim of a mind control programme run by Britain and the US in conjunction with surviving Nazis, including an attempt to create a \u201csuperman\u201d warrior. </p> <p>Believers have long raised concerns that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ufos\">UFO</a> researchers are being killed by \u201cmen in black\u201d and Spiers\u2019 death prompted online discussion suggesting he was murdered because of his work. </p> <p>On the whistleblower website, <a href=\"http://projectcamelotportal.com/\">Project Camelot</a>, Kerry Cassidy wrote: \u201cThis death is very suspicious. I now have reason to believe a cover-up is in motion.\u201d</p> <p>Talking about her son\u2019s acquaintances in Poland, Bates told KMTV: \u201cThese people seemed to be involved in some very, very dark and dangerous areas of the world and I was afraid that as he was gaining popularity and fame perhaps somebody would want him out of the way ie not alive any longer.\u2019<br></p> <p>Spiers\u2019 body was flown home a week after his death and a postmortem examination was carried out in Kent. Bates said she was still waiting for the results and had not been told whether there would be an inquest. <br></p> <p>\u201cApparently, he had not suffered any obvious physical injuries but he could have been slowly poisoned, which is why the results of toxicology tests from his postmortem are so important,\u201d the English teacher said.<br></p> <p>The North East Kent coroner\u2019s court said it could not comment on the case unless an inquest was announced. In the event of a death overseas an inquest should usually take place \u201cif the cause of death is unknown or if it was sudden, violent or unnatural\u201d.</p> <p>A UK Foreign Office spokesman said: \u201cWe provided assistance to the family of a British national following his death in Warsaw, Poland, in July.\u201d</p>",

One morning, the gentleman was woken by a great noise, and found his lion growling over the corpse of the servant, having bitten his head off. \u201cThe terror of the gentleman may be easily conceived,\u201d the text observes.</p> <p>Another story highlighted the dangers of shooting deer in tiger country. The only son of Sir Hugo Monro was sitting down for a rest with his companions, when a tiger jumped at him and dragged him into the jungle.

Do not read unless you have watched episode four, which airs in the UK on Sky Atlantic on Tuesday at 9pm.</em></p> <h2>Please allow me to introduce myself</h2> <p>Wyatt by name, \u201cskin the faces of your adversaries and wear them as masks\u201d by nature. Westworld\u2019s new villain is not quite a man and not quite a devil, but he\u2019s ferocious and mysterious and all part of Ford\u2019s grand plan to take his park in a bold new direction. And now, only Teddy stands in his way. Well, Teddy and a human who\u2019s a pretty good aim with a shotgun.</p> <p>Last week, Ford rejected a new narrative designed to inspire terror in the park\u2019s guests. This week it seems he\u2019s replaced it with something even more horrible. Wyatt\u2019s backstory is that of a Yankee soldier who heard the voice of God \u2013 and that voice told him to start killing. Believing that the land belongs not to the homesteaders or the native people but \u201csomething yet to come\u201d, he set about clearing the terrain for their arrival. In the company of a gang who like to skin their victims or, more simply, just torture them and tie them to trees for the flies to munch on. </p> <p>Teddy remembers Wyatt from the war. At least he does now Ford has uploaded a backstory into our gunslinger. Until now, Teddy has been a simple bounty-hunter, with an unfulfillable desire to be with Dolores and no past beyond an indefinable sense of guilt. Ford has now tied that guilt to Wyatt and the enmity between the two is personal. Teddy has no choice but to hunt the man down. This, in turn, means he must leave Dolores. He says he will return \u201csome day\u201d. The loop has been ruptured.</p> <h2>Had his moment of doubt and pain</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"803e42f2618dd00182dacb468bf66c080b503000\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/803e42f2618dd00182dacb468bf66c080b503000/0_0_5094_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Elsie on the trail of the runaway woodchopper host.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"754\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Elsie on the trail of the runaway woodchopper host.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: HBO</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Teddy\u2019s not the only one who\u2019s strayed from the beaten path. Elsie and Ashley (such cute names) spend much of this episode on the trail of a runaway Host. He\u2019s a woodcutter by trade but has abandoned his work mid-chop and appears to have developed ideas beyond his station. He\u2019s been crafting maps of the stars on to ornamental bears, which may have been the inspiration behind his dash for the edge of the park. Such activity, it seems fair to say, is a worry for Westworld HQ. After all, as Ashley puts it, even at their most high-functioning, \u201call that\u2019s stopping [the hosts] from killing us is one line of code.\u201d</p> <p>The duo eventually find their man trapped in a crevasse. He\u2019s waving his arms at them, in a way that\u2019s either an appeal for help or an audition for a part in The Walking Dead. Ashley goes to set him loose and starts sensitively hacking away at his body parts. But lo, the escapee isn\u2019t fond of that and goes berserk. He escapes and for a minute it looks like he\u2019s going to brain Elsie with a huge rock. Only at the vital moment does he have a change of heart and brain himself instead.</p> <h2>When I saw it was time for a change</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"09cf78f8920bff8786b3cce23c9358eb64d21bba\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/09cf78f8920bff8786b3cce23c9358eb64d21bba/0_0_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The loop has been ruptured \u2026 Teddy and Dolores must part.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The loop has been ruptured \u2026 Teddy and Dolores must part.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: HBO</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>So we\u2019ve characters being rewritten and characters rewriting themselves. But of all the hosts in tumult only Dolores is conscious of change. That\u2019s all thanks to Bernard interfering with the programming of our wild west Alice in Wonderland. He\u2019s allowed her to ask questions, of herself and of an existential nature. As a result she now wants to leave Westworld, preferably with Teddy, but the look on her face when he leaves to fight Wyatt suggests she might just have to go whatever. Later she tells Bernard, \u201cwhen I discover who I am I\u2019ll be free.\u201d It seems like she\u2019s on that path already.<br></p> <p>Dolores has been remembering past circuits of her loop \u2013 events that should have been wiped from her memory. But not only are they coming back to her, she is using them to shape her future actions. After digging up a gun last week, she chooses to hide it in her chest of drawers. But while it\u2019s there one minute, the next it\u2019s not, and by the end of the episode it\u2019s hidden in a haystack where the abhorrent Rebus is about to assault her. She picks it up and at the instruction of a voice in her head, and overriding her programming, shoots Rebus dead. With that she flees the ranch and ultimately collapses into the arms of Newcomer William.</p> <h2>What\u2019s puzzling you, is the nature of my game</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"33b26958fc94768cefcae19c61dcf78295c888cc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/33b26958fc94768cefcae19c61dcf78295c888cc/0_13_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018The bicameral mind you say?\u2019 Ford and Bernard discuss Westworld\u2019s faults.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018The bicameral mind you say?\u2019 Ford and Bernard discuss Westworld\u2019s faults.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: HBO</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Three weeks in and there\u2019s a lot going on. But there are also a lot questions hanging in the air. The first time I watched the episode I kept wondering why Teddy and Dolores spend so much time by themselves. For whose benefit is it? Not the guests it seems. And not for the hosts, because they have no feelings that aren\u2019t programmed. The second time of watching, it seemed to be just one of several lacunae. The death of Bernard\u2019s son is a backstory as awkwardly levered into play as Teddy\u2019s. And in a less than convincing scene, we see Ford apparently explain to Bernard that the root of all the unusual activity in Westworld is the fault of his former partner Arnold, who always wanted to create conscious robots because he was a bit lonely. Arnold\u2019s not there to explain (unless he\u2019s the piano player in the room as Ford and Bernard speak) so all we\u2019re left with is a splurge of expositional dialogue and a passing mention of the \u201cbicameral mind\u201d. Quite frankly I was confused, but the upshot is, I think, that robots are becoming conscious and there\u2019s not much anyone in the park can do about it, even if they wanted to. </p> <h2>Notes from the prairie</h2> <p>Kudos to the effects department for the mapping of a young Anthony Hopkins on to the face of a young Ford. It was convincing enough for me, and I remember a time when it never was.</p> <p>And while we\u2019re at it, I\u2019m a big fan of the 3d iPad. I\u2019d like one by Xmas 2025 please.</p> <p>Our nerdy newcomer William claimed his first kill this week. Or in the words of his obnoxious future brother-in-law Logan, he \u201cpopped his cherry\u201d. In one brief shot before this announcement, Logan is shown emerging late from bed either adjusting his crotch or scratching it. Which raises the important question: do the hosts carry crabs now?<br></p> <h2>Questions for next week</h2> <p>Is the map the escapee following related to that on the gunslinger\u2019s acquired scalp?</p> <p>What does Ford want from Wyatt?</p> <p>Is Bernard a \u2018bot? </p>",

Ultimately, we need to make sure that we are all working together to ensure that we make a success of Brexit.\u201d<br></p> <p>Asked about reports of \u201clively debates\u201d in cabinet, she said: \u201cI think this reflects the fact that the prime minister is pursuing a collective government approach, where either in cabinet or through cabinet committees, relevant cabinet ministers involved are able to discuss and debate the issues before decisions are reached.\u201d</p> <p>While the committee meeting in question, held last Wednesday, was described as convened to float ideas rather than commit to definite proposals, the briefings and counter-briefings \u2013 Treasury sources said the idea of a row was \u201cnonsense\u201d \u2013 hints at potentially significant tensions within the government over how to proceed.</p> <p>Another unnamed source told the Telegraph of Hammond: \u201cHe is arguing from a very Treasury point of view.

  "<p>No less than 17 years have passed since new rules were approved in the UK to save thousands of lives by limiting deadly air pollution in our towns and cities.<br></p> <p>Pollution is the \u201cinvisible killer\u201d because, for the most part, it goes unseen. Its impact on human health and the planet is why those laws were necessary. </p> <p>Yet disgracefully \u2013 and illegally \u2013 we are still subjected to excruciatingly dirty air. Conditions are sometimes so poor that you notice it in your nostrils or lungs. Those days, when the air feels thick with fumes, you may be under the impression that it\u2019s just one vehicle with a bad exhaust in front of you which is to blame. It\u2019s generally not.</p> <p>London\u2019s pollution \u2013 the worst in the UK \u2013 was visible on a trip I made to Canary Wharf a few weeks ago. From the 11th floor, a brown haze sat across the skyline, its deadly toxins testing the health of millions of city-dwellers and workers, particularly those who suffer from asthma, heart or respiratory conditions.</p> <p>Pollution is right there with you when you\u2019re puffing as you cycle through the park on a summer\u2019s day, or when you\u2019re chatting with friends on a visit to the shops on a Saturday morning, or when you\u2019re taking your child to school. </p> <p>Why are you and I are still inhaling unlawful levels of nitrogen dioxide nearly 20 years after it should have been cleaned up? </p> <p>There is a simple answer: because the UK government is breaking its own and the EU\u2019s laws. </p> <p>It has failed to protect your health and mine, and more importantly the health of our children. It has failed legally. And it has failed morally. </p> <p>ClientEarth is taking the government back to court on Tuesday, because of the lack of urgency, the failure to tackle the problem. Cleaning the air isn\u2019t rocket science. Not doing so is simply unacceptable political behaviour. </p> <p>The fact that it\u2019s taken the Department for Environment, Food &amp; Rural Affairs (Defra) 18 months <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/13/electric-vehicles-could-go-first-at-traffic-lights-under-uk-clean-air-zone-plans\">to launch a consultation on just five clean air zones</a> \u2013 when there are many more badly polluted towns and cities across the UK \u2013 is just one illustration of that lackadaisical attitude.</p> <p>In April last year, in our first legal challenge, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/apr/29/supreme-court-orders-uk-to-draw-up-air-pollution-cleanup-plan\">the supreme court ordered the environment secretary to draw up a new Air Quality plan</a> to meet legal limits in the shortest time possible. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/dec/17/illegal-air-pollution-will-blight-many-uk-cities-for-at-least-five-years\">The plan</a> was woefully inadequate and didn\u2019t envisage UK compliance on pollution levels until 2025. That would be 26 years since the rules were first approved. </p> <p>Not only that, but while motor manufacturers have been exploiting legal loopholes and using dubious techniques to pass emissions tests, the government has failed to hold them to account - <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/sep/26/uk-tried-to-block-tougher-eu-car-emissions-tests\">while bidding behind the scenes to allow increased emissions</a>. </p> <p>The Treasury, meanwhile, is still giving incentives through the tax system, for motorists to buy diesel cars. That is also unacceptable.</p> <p>A reason some give for not taking action to solve this public health crisis is the cost to the economy and the Treasury and the impact on business, hauliers and motorists. But surely the health impacts of pollution are worth more than that? </p> <p>Pollution is responsible for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/feb/22/indoor-and-outdoor-air-pollution-claiming-at-least-40000-uk-lives-a-year\">40,000 premature deaths in the UK</a>. It triggers heart attacks and strokes. It can make existing heart conditions worse. It causes cancer and stunted lung growth in children. It aggravates respiratory conditions which can be fatal. </p> <p> But there is also a substantial economic and societal impact. Defra\u2019s own analysis suggests that the cost to the economy from early deaths by air pollution is \u00a327.5bn. Every year.</p> <p> So what should the government be doing? A national network of Clean Air Zones, preventing the worst polluting vehicles from entering our towns and city centres; a scheme to retrofit buses and heavy goods vehicles to make them compliant with legal emissions limits; and a targeted diesel scrappage scheme part funded by the car industry \u2013 used to fund low emission vehicles and alternatives to car use. </p> <p>Other solutions should run in tandem: a clean public transport system and a car labelling scheme so that motorists know they cars they are buying are compliant with emissions limits in the real world.</p> <p>That would be a start. There is also a great opportunity: to move the economy toward zero emission vehicles.

  "<p> </p> <p>On 8 July, fighting erupted in the capital of South Sudan between members of the presidential guard and forces loyal to then vice-president, Riek Machar.

In an article that was circulated among humanitarians but not published online, an NGO representative admonished the survivors and organisations for \u201cfailing to proactively speak out\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/aug/19/how-should-the-media-report-and-sexual-violence\">How should the media report rape and sexual violence?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This silence, the paper suggested, contributed to an environment in which the cost of perpetrating these types of attacks had become increasingly negligible. The paper concluded that in these types of situations \u201cthe decision to speak out needs to be taken by those at a safe distance\u201d given the \u201cimpossible decisions\u201d facing staff on the ground. </p> <p>I\u2019ve been thinking about this. And I can\u2019t help but feel that while the dangers of silence are indeed real and may contribute to a continuation of impunity, the answer is not to further take away control from the survivors.</p> <p>In fact, this may achieve the opposite of what it intends. Knowing that the decision to share deeply personal information will be taken by someone \u201cat a safe distance\u201d is likely to prevent survivors from coming forward at all \u2013 meaning that not only will the issue not be addressed, but the survivor will be far less likely to receive critical medical, psychological and organisational support. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The decision to speak, or not to speak, should rest with the survivor</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>One of the most fundamental aspects of critical incident management in cases of sexual violence is helping the survivor to regain control over their lives and over the decisions that affect them. The decision to speak, or not to speak, should rest with the survivor, and our responsibility as organisations and as a humanitarian community is to create the conditions in which either one of those options is possible. If the survivor wants to speak out, we should do everything in our power to support that. And equally, if the survivor wants to keep their experiences private, we have an obligation to respect that as well. </p> <p>While the paper mentioned above specifically addressed reporting for advocacy purposes, the same principle applies to mandatory reporting within organisations for other reasons. Many NGOs and UN agencies require staff to report security incidents so that managers can track trends and understand the security environment. Both of these objectives are of course completely warranted (though as a general rule of thumb, managers should assume sexual violence is a risk, even if there is no evidence to prove it). But making reporting mandatory, regardless of the rationale, is simply counterproductive when it comes to cases involving sexual violence. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2015/oct/19/sexual-violence-aid-sector-ngo-action\">Sexual violence in the aid sector: what should NGOs be doing?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>To take it to the hyperbolic extreme, threatening a survivor with negative consequences for not reporting an incident is much less effective than helping them to understand the positive benefits and support they would receive if they were to report voluntarily. Forcing someone to report under duress is only likely to contribute to a hostile work environment and discourage others from reporting in the future. </p> <p>With this context in mind, the question we should be asking ourselves is, \u201cWhat can be done to create an environment in which a survivor feels comfortable coming forward on their own?\u201d The first step to this process is understanding the barriers to reporting, so that one by one, these barriers can be broken down. Unsurprisingly, some of the most common fears of survivors are that confidentiality will not be respected, or that they will be pressured to do something they are not comfortable with, whether it\u2019s advocate publicly on the issue, or be evacuated to a location where they have no support network. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We have to ask ourselves how we can better support survivors of sexual violence</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The second step is making sure that the organisation is prepared to manage sexual violence cases so that they can respond effectively and sensitively if and when a survivor does come forward. This means ensuring that staff have been trained on managing incidents of sexual violence, providing psychological first aid, and respecting confidentiality, and that they know how to help survivors access appropriate medical and psychological care. Organisations cannot encourage (much less require) individuals to report sexual violence without first having these basic measures in place.</p> <p>We also have to ask ourselves how, as a broader humanitarian community, we can better support survivors of sexual violence. Stigma and the rumour mill are still significant barriers to reporting. For many people, a natural reaction to hearing about an incident of sexual violence is to find out as much information as they can (who it was, when it happened, how it happened), as if somehow by knowing all the details, they will find out something that means it won\u2019t happen to them. Unfortunately, knowing all the details is not only unlikely to make the person feel better, but it compromises the well-being and rights of the survivor. Briefing staff on the information that\u2019s available, and encouraging them not to gossip, can avoid this.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/oct/17/how-should-sexual-violence-be-reported-ngos\">How should sexual violence be reported by humanitarian organisations?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Finally, if and when a survivor does want to speak, we should be ready to support this as well. This requires standing together as a community: advocacy on these types of issues can rarely be done by one actor alone, particularly if the incidents are being perpetrated by men in uniform. This advocacy doesn\u2019t necessarily have to been done publicly (sometimes the greatest successes are won through private conversations), but regardless of the approach, there has to be solidarity in supporting one another to deliver a common message. This advocacy must be done on the survivors\u2019 terms. When done carefully and collectively, this type of unified action can make a powerful statement. </p> <p>Attacks on humanitarian staff have reached an alarming scale, and as a community we must all think through how we can best prevent and respond to these types of incidents. The most important issue is to maintain the focus on the survivors: while they may be humanitarians, they are first and foremost humans, and our role is to be there to support them.</p> <p><em>If you or your organisation needs advice on how to prepare for incidents of sexual violence, <a href=\"https://www.reporttheabuse.org/\">Report the Abuse</a> has a list of resources on their website, including this helpful <a href=\"http://www.reporttheabuse.org/website/wp-content/uploads/Prevention-Policy-and-Procedure-Checklist-Report-the-Abuse-August-2016.pdf\">preparedness checklist</a>.

  "<p>I will always remember the mood at the oversubscribed first meeting of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/the3million\" title=\"\">the 3 Million forum</a> in early July in Bristol. The anxiety in the room was palpable. People who had lived in the UK for anything between a couple of years and 60 or more were suddenly finding themselves in a bubble of suspended time, with huge question marks about their future, their lives and their families. Something had to happen; apathy was not an option.</p> <p>The official message since July has been that \u201cnothing has changed\u201d, a message relayed on the gov.uk pages relating to the application for a <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/apply-for-a-uk-residence-card/permanent-residence-card\" title=\"\">permanent residence card</a>. The reality on the ground is that, effectively, everything has changed for us. People calling the Home Office have been told to apply for the card ever since the announcement of the referendum in February, as proof of their entitlement to stay. This is also the advice proffered by many immigration lawyers and EU law experts. The process is worse than your worst bureaucratic nightmare, and worse still if your life is complex and you require the services of an immigration lawyer to help you through the application, something that the majority of potential applicants cannot afford.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/05/eu-citizens-brexit-foreigners-hate-crime-britain-tolerance\">We need a country that works for everyone \u2013 EU citizens included | Jakub Krupa</a> </p> </aside>  <p>We started the 3 Million forum with the aim of preserving the rights of EU nationals living in the UK. \u201cRights\u201d is a funny concept.

Without a caliphate, Isis would find it significantly harder to call on recruits to join in its war against the rest of the world.</p> <p>But the jihadis have had a string of territorial defeats this year in both Iraq and Syria \u2013 only on Sunday they <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/16/turkish-opposition-fighters-syria-dabiq-islamic-state\">lost the town of Dabiq to Syrian rebel fighters</a> backed by Turkey. The loss of Mosul would be one of its greatest, because the city was acquired after beating the US-backed Iraqi army. It was from Mosul\u2019s Great Mosque that Isis leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi made a rare public speech in 2014 in which he declared himself the new global caliph and called on followers to \u201cdo jihad in the cause of God, incite the believers, and be patient in the face of this hardship\u201d.</p> <p>Losing Mosul would also make it easier for Isis\u2019s opponents to recapture the group\u2019s Syrian capital of Raqqa, because major supply routes from Iraq would be cut.</p> <p>For these reasons, the assault is expected to be a protracted and difficult one, with Isis thought to have between 5,000 and 8,000 fighters ready to defend Mosul. These fighters are hidden among a dwindling civilian population of approximately 600,000, most of whom are expected to flee as the battle intensifies.</p> <p>Isis have had months to prepare and will seek to use hit-and-run tactics, ambushes, snipers, bombs, berms and trenches to slow down the Iraqi forces.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/10/mosul-irbil-zip/giv-1406dZmG6zVDudi1/\" data-alt=\"Mosul map\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/10/mosul-irbil-zip/giv-1406dZmG6zVDudi1/\">Mosul map</a> </figure>  <h2><strong>Who is involved in the attack?</strong></h2> <p>The offensive is a joint operation by more than 30,000 troops from the Iraqi army, Kurdish peshmerga and a Shia paramilitary force.

But while leaving can mean trekking through minefields, and the risk of discovery and punishment by Isis, those who stay know they face airstrikes, street battles, a potential siege by the Iraqi security forces (ISF) and the grim possibility of being used as human shields by Isis.</p> <p>Isis has used civilians for protection in other cities it lost control of in recent months, and militants have already moved into residential areas to try to blunt the impact of US airstrikes now landing near ordinary homes. Those stuck in Mosul are digging makeshift bomb shelters, stockpiling food, and, as the battle draws closer, mostly staying at home to avoid bombs or provoking militants. </p> <p>The United Nations and aid organisations warned that a huge number of civilians were in immediate danger as the operation got under way. \u201cI am extremely concerned for the safety of up to 1.5 million people,\u201d the UN deputy secretary general for humanitarian affairs and emergency relief, Stephen O\u2019Brien, said. \u201cDepending on the intensity and scope of the fighting, as many as 1 million people may be forced to flee their homes in a worst-case scenario.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/17/victory-isis-iraq-offensive-mosul\">Victory over Isis will not solve Iraq\u2019s problems | Ranj Alaaldin</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Save the Children have said the lives of more than half a million children \u201cnow hang in the balance\u201d. The Norwegian Refugee Council said safe exits from Mosul must be provided or civilians would be faced with the \u201cbleakest of choices: stay behind and risk their lives under attack, or risk their lives trying to flee\u201d.<br></p> <p>One of the pressing questions is how to cater for what will potentially be the largest single exodus of people at any point since mid-2014. The new wave of displace people is likely to be far more difficult to manage than the war itself, and authorities and aid agencies were desperately trying to finalise plans before the attack. </p> <h2><strong>Why have sectarian concerns featured in the buildup to the fight?</strong></h2> <p>Sectarian tensions remained high in the region throughout the post-Saddam years, and peaked before Isis swept into Mosul in 2014. As the terror group arrived, Iraqi forces who were mostly Shia and had alienated the local population, quickly surrendered the city. Restoring trust with Baghdad and re-establishing basic governance therefore loom as the biggest challenge of the post-Isis period.<br></p> <p>Iraq\u2019s central government remains weak and has little influence in Sunni areas of the country. The US, which maintained a presence in Mosul until 2010, no longer has an occupying presence in Iraq. Barack Obama has made clear that the 6,000 troops his administration has redeployed are there only to fight Isis and not to provide military muscle in support of a diplomatic push to hold the country together.</p> <p>As for the offensive, Shia militias and Kurdish peshmerga forces which have played vital roles in the war against Isis are not slated to enter the largely Sunni Mosul. The Iraqi military, which is largely made up of Shia soldiers and officers, will take the lead in the battle. </p> <p>Iraq\u2019s counter-terrorism forces, which performed well in the four-week battle to retake Falluja in June, are expected to lead the fight. Peshmerga units are planning to take up blocking positions to the north and east, where they will also receive and screen fleeing civilians. The popular mobilisation units, known in Iraq as Hashd al-Sha\u2019bi, have been confined to a blocking role to the west of Mosul.</p> <p>An Iraqi intelligence official said: \u201cThere is an agreement about the structure, and the order in which [forces] come in. This is the last battle in Iraq and everyone wants to be included. It was a wise move to let the Shia militia be involved but in designated areas, and under control. I don\u2019t think after two years fighting Isis you can keep out the Shia in the last battle of Iraq.<br></p> <p> \u201cIf we cannot reassure Sunnis they will fight to the death. There are small elements trying to assassinate [Isis], and trying to make them feel uncomfortable, but it largely depends on the tribes. We are trying to tell the Sunnis inside this is coming, and people reaching out to them and saying they have a second chance.\u201d</p>",

Industrial-strength heaters suspended several metres above the ground from metal scaffolding on the perimeter of three plots will heat the soil and undergrowth to 4C above the forest\u2019s ambient temperature. </p> <p>Wood is about to start up an experiment that may help climate scientists to figure out how jungles in the Amazon, the Congo and elsewhere will reacting to rising temperatures. Earth\u2019s equatorial band of forests might either slow down or speed up global warming, scientists say, depending on how it responds to higher temperatures.</p> <p>Each year fossil fuel exhaust adds about 30bn tonnes of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. Half of it remains aloft. The rest is absorbed quickly \u2014 in about equal parts \u2014 by ocean water and plants on land, buffering the rate at which the insulating gas builds up. \u201cNature has done us a fantastic favour,\u201d says Scott Denning, an atmospheric scientist at Colorado State University, Fort Collins. </p> <p>But nature might not be so generous on a hotter planet, Denning says. While researchers expect little change in what the ocean does, vegetation on land, especially in the tropics, might soak up less or even convert into CO2 the vast stockpiles of carbon now locked up in their soils into CO2. </p> <p>Jerry Melillo, a scientist at the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, said that increased atmospheric warming caused by CO2 emanating from tropical soil could further raise soil temperatures. The warmer soil could, in turn, release even more carbon dioxide, heating up the atmosphere even further. \u201cSo that warming will beget more warming.\u201d Some researchers say the mutually reinforcing feedback might be impossible to halt once set in motion.</p> <p>What happens in tropical jungles depends on how they respond to several anticipated changes: increased concentrations of CO2 in the air, warmer temperatures and changes in precipitation. Experiments have warmed up ecosystems elsewhere. Melillo has been heating a New England forest with buried cables since 1991. He says that for decades he\u2019s urging other scientists to run a similar experiment in the tropics.

A recent PwC report shows Ireland has gone up the rankings to overtake Luxembourg on a basket of factors.<br></p> <p>Owens believes the most obvious candidates for moving will be those working in fund management, rather than investment banking. Ireland is already a significant administrator of funds, second only to Luxembourg in Europe, he says.<br></p> <p>It also looks attractive from a legal point of view. If Britain leaves the single market, contracts and accounts may have to be rewritten to comply with single market regulations. Nearly all banking contracts are based on British common law rather than the civil law system of Germany or France.</p> <p>As Ireland\u2019s legal system is also based on common law, document changes would be minimised. \u201cBanks would be very comforted by that,\u201d says Owens. \u201cRepapering would be a legal and administrative nightmare.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s not just financial firms that might look west. Marina Donohoe, the EU and northern Europe director of Enterprise Ireland, says she has been fielding calls from other companies interested in the opportunities offered by being based in Ireland. \u201cWe are getting calls from people who are saying that they have been here for 10 years, \u2018I have got an engineering business, it is in the Midlands, I am employing and I am now thinking of moving lock, stock and barrel to Ireland, what is your interest in that?\u2019\u201d she said.</p> <h2>...to those who wait</h2> <p>Ireland has decades of experience luring multinationals <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/feb/07/google-ireland-staff-paid-less-than-half-their-london-colleagues\">such as Google</a>, Facebook and Pfizer to Dublin, with its low tax rates and anglophone, well-educated labour force.<br></p> <p>But capacity is a problem.

But in American men, lung cancer death rates <a href=\"http://www.cancer.org/acs/groups/content/@research/documents/document/acspc-047079.pdf\">have fallen</a> by about 40% over the past 25 years. In women, lung cancer rates have peaked.</p> <p>That\u2019s because the proportion of adults in the US who smoke has decreased by about <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/data_statistics/tables/trends/cig_smoking\">50%</a> since the 1960s, due to public education, indoor smoking bans and higher prices due to higher tobacco taxes. This reduction happened despite the ongoing, vigorous efforts of tobacco companies to <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/big-tobacco-aims-its-guns-to-kill-california-tobacco-tax-63750\">combat these public health initiatives</a>.</p> <p>Similar reductions in France and South Africa have been achieved <a href=\"http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra1308383\">by increasing cigarette prices</a>. However, the number of smokers is still increasing in countries such as <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/13/health/study-shows-spread-of-cigarettes-in-china.html\">China</a> and <a href=\"http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2016/06/01/indonesia-on-track-to-worlds-highest-smoking-rates.html\">Indonesia</a> as tobacco companies seek new markets, and a demographic bulge of younger potential smokers enters adolescence.</p> <p>The World Health Organization <a href=\"http://www.who.int/fctc/en/\">Framework Convention on Tobacco Control</a> is the international blueprint on policies to reduce the uptake of smoking and encourage current smokers to quit.</p> <p>The United States is one of only seven countries that has signed but not ratified the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control.

You asked Google \u2013 here\u2019s the answer | Ranjana Srivastava</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>Liver cancer: focus on vaccines and curing hepatitis C infections</h2> <p>Liver cancer is the <a href=\"http://globocan.iarc.fr/old/FactSheets/cancers/liver-new.asp\">second most common cause of cancer death worldwide</a>, killing about three-quarters of a million people. It is the <a href=\"http://www.cancer.org/acs/groups/content/@research/documents/document/acspc-047079.pdf\">fifth most common cause of cancer death</a> in the US.</p> <p>The most common causes of liver cancer are infection with hepatitis B or hepatitis C virus. In some countries the <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11922091\">dietary contaminant aflatoxin</a>, produced by molds that grow on stored grains or nuts, exacerbates the risk that hepatitis B infection will cause liver cancer.</p> <p>Hepatitis B infection is almost entirely preventable by vaccination in infancy. In fact, an 80% decline in liver cancer rates has been observed in Taiwanese birth cohorts <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1089326115000021\">that have received the vaccination early in life</a>.</p> <p>While rates of infant hepatitis B vaccination are high around the world, <a href=\"http://www.who.int/immunization/monitoring_surveillance/burden/vpd/surveillance_type/passive/HepB_map_schedule.jpg?ua=1\">many babies are still missing out</a>. Universal vaccination would lead to a further decline in liver disease and liver cancer globally.</p> <p>Hepatitis C causes about <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/carcin/bgp263\">a quarter of liver cancer</a> deaths worldwide. Curative therapies like the new drug <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/20/business/high-cost-of-hepatitis-c-drug-prompts-a-call-to-void-its-patents.html\">Sovaldi</a> may be another tool to prevent liver cancer. Researchers think that curing patients of their hepatitis C infection will prevent them from going on to develop liver cancer.</p> <p>But the current cost of these drugs is a <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1056/NEJMp1400160\">substantial barrier</a> to their use in both lower-income countries and in the US.</p> <p>However, in Egypt, public-private partnerships have made the drugs available <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/16/health/hepatitis-c-treatment-egypt.html\">at less than 1/100th</a> of their price in the United States. A vigorous international effort to use these new drugs to lower the number of infections would have a substantial impact on liver cancers caused by hepatitis C.</p> <p>Heavier <a href=\"https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/alcohol/alcohol-fact-sheet\">alcohol drinking also increases the risk</a> of liver cancer (as well as cancers of the breast, esophagus, pancreas, colon and rectum). According to the World Health Organization consumption has been increasing in the two most populous countries, <a href=\"http://gamapserver.who.int/gho/interactive_charts/gisah/consumption_change/atlas.html\">India and China</a>.</p> <h2>Cervical cancer: vaccines and Pap smears</h2> <p>Cervical cancer kills more than 250,000 women a year worldwide, making it the <a href=\"http://globocan.iarc.fr/old/summary_table_pop-html.asp?selection=224900&amp;title=World&amp;sex=2&amp;type=1&amp;window=1&amp;sort=2&amp;submit=%C2%A0Execute%C2%A0\">fourth-leading cause of cancer death among women</a>. In the US, however, <a href=\"http://www.cancer.org/acs/groups/content/@research/documents/document/acspc-047079.pdf\">it is 14th</a>. From 1975 to 2012, the incidence of cervical cancer in the <a href=\"http://seer.cancer.gov/statfacts/html/cervix.html\">US decreased by half</a>, due to Pap smear tests screening and removal of precancerous lesions.</p> <p>However, almost all cases of cervical cancer are due to infection with the Human Papillomavirus (HPV), and we now have a vaccine against the main strains of HPV. In theory, cervical cancer is almost entirely preventable if HPV vaccination before the onset of sexual activity is followed by screening in adulthood to detect precancerous lesions caused by virus strains not covered by the vaccine. Yet the vaccine is not available <a href=\"http://www.gavi.org/uploadedImages/Types_of_support/NVS/HPV/HPV-vaccine-infographic-1600_source.jpg\">to most girls in the world</a>.</p> <p>The World Health Organization\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.who.int/immunization/programmes_systems/supply_chain/benefits_of_immunization/en/\">Expanded Program on Immunization</a> ensures that 85% of the world\u2019s young children now receive at least DPT vaccine against diptheria, pertussis and tetanus. This program created new distribution channels for vaccine and could be a model for increasing the number of prepubertal girls who receive the HPV vaccine.</p> <p>Making sure that more women around the world receive the decades-old Pap smear testing or introducing the new HPV tests would also help reduce cervical cancer incidence.</p> <h2>We can also tackle childhood leukemia and breast cancer</h2> <p>In developed countries, the most common form of childhood leukemia, acute lymphocytic leukemia, is cured by conventional chemotherapy in over <a href=\"http://www.cancer.org/cancer/leukemiainchildren/detailedguide/childhood-leukemia-survival-rates\">80% of affected children</a>. These life-saving, relatively inexpensive drugs have been available in the US for decades. Yet in other parts of the world, most children with leukemia die because they do not receive treatment.</p> <p>Drugs like <a href=\"https://www.cancer.gov/types/breast/research/10-years-tamoxifen\">Tamoxifen</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cancer.gov/types/breast/breast-hormone-therapy-fact-sheet\">aromatase inhibitors</a> have decreased mortality from estrogen-fueled breast cancers in the developed world. Yet most women in the developing world with these cancers do not receive these inexpensive medications.</p> <p>While leukemia and breast cancer require relatively sophisticated diagnostic and treatment infrastructure, they don\u2019t require new treatments. The still-missing piece is the political will and funding to expand access to these long-established treatments.</p> <h2>Optimizing the technology and knowledge we already have</h2> <p>Pinning our hopes on new technologies isn\u2019t the only way to reduce cancer deaths worldwide. A moonshot-level impact could be guaranteed just by ensuring the interventions and treatments we already know to be effective are deployed around the world.</p> <p>Critically, we already have models that show how this can be done. Programs, such as <a href=\"http://www.pepfar.gov/\">the President\u2019s Emergency Fund for Aids Relief</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.theglobalfund.org/en\">Global Fund for HIV, TB and Malaria</a> made lifesaving antiretroviral drugs available to millions of HIV patients by negotiating much lower drug prices. The programs also helped countries establish the necessary infrastructure to deliver the drugs and monitor patients.</p> <p>There is much more we can do to prevent cancer in the US. Although smoking rates have done down, <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/data_statistics/fact_sheets/adult_data/cig_smoking/\">17% of adults still smoke</a>. Less than half of our teenage girls and boys received the recommended three doses of the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2011/p0825_hpv_vaccine.html\">HPV vaccine</a>. Racial disparities <a href=\"http://www.cancer.gov/research/areas/disparities\">still exist</a> in access to early detection and treatment of cancers.</p> <p>For the cancers we cannot prevent, we will always need new and better therapies. But we should not wait for future cures to do what we can to prevent cancer deaths around the world.</p> <p>We can choose to prevent many cancers and cancer deaths globally. In the words of <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/centers/johnson/about/history/jsc40/jsc_gallery_people_image29.html\">President John F Kennedy</a> in launching the first moonshot:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills, because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone.</p> </blockquote> <p><em>This story first appeared on <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/us\">The Conversation</a>.</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"counter\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://counter.theconversation.edu.au/content/54077/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic&quot; alt=&quot;The Conversation&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>",
  "<p>Son Heung-min is remembered at Bayer Leverkusen as an authentic global star; a player who scored important goals and fired Champions League qualifications and one who brought additional clout on the commercial front. Unfortunately for Son, who returns to his former club with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/tottenham-hotspur\">Tottenham Hotspur</a> in the Champions League on Tuesday night, the manner of his departure remains fresh in the memory, too.</p> <p>Son began last season as a Leverkusen player, having started in the Bundesliga opener at home to Hoffenheim and the first leg of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/championsleague\">Champions League</a> play off away against Lazio. Then Tottenham ramped up their interest and, on the day before the return against Lazio, there was no sign of Son at Bayer\u2019s open training session.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/18/bayer-leverkusen-roger-schmidt-tottenham-mauricio-pochettino-champions-league\">Bayer Leverkusen\u2019s Roger Schmidt: 'I never wanted to be a football manager'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The South Korea international had been ill the previous weekend and he had missed Bayer\u2019s league fixture at Hannover. However, when he failed to make the game against Lazio, there was disappointment. Bayer were 1-0 down from the first leg and it felt as though they would need all of their attacking weapons.</p> <p>The Leverkusen sporting director, Rudi V\u00f6ller, said that Son \u201cwould not have played anyway because he was sick at the weekend\u201d but in the same interview he revealed that the forward had been in London to undergo his Tottenham medical. \u201cAt this moment, he is our player,\u201d Voller said, at the time. \u201cI saw many medicals in this business where there was no deal afterwards.\u201d</p> <p>It was a tough sell for V\u00f6ller and, you suspect, he knew it. On the upside, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/aug/27/champions-league-riundup-bayer-leverkusen\">Bayer beat Lazio 3-0</a> to advance into the Champions League group phase but it is fair to say that some of the club\u2019s players and members of staff were unimpressed at Son\u2019s timing. Thirty-six hours later, Tottenham made the announcement that he had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/aug/28/tottenham-sign-son-heung-min-bayer-leverkusen-22m\">joined them on a five-year contract</a>.</p> <p>The incident stands to colour how the 24-year-old is welcomed back to the BayArena, with local commentators having predicted that his reception could be lukewarm. Son admitted on Monday that he was \u201cnot sure how it\u2019s going to be,\u201d although he made plain his affection for the club and its supporters. \u201cNacer Chadli didn\u2019t celebrate when he scored against us on Saturday [for West Bromwich Albion] and if I score on Tuesday, I will not celebrate,\u201d Son said. \u201cI respect Leverkusen too much.\u201d</p> <p>There is unlikely to be the venom that was directed towards Gonzalo Castro, the former Bayer trainee and club symbol, who moved to Borussia Dortmund over the summer and returned with his new employer at the beginning of the month. The 29-year-old\u2019s every touch during <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/01/borussia-dortmund-bayer-leverkusen-bundesliga-match-report\">Bayer\u2019s 2-0 win</a> was jeered.</p> <p>But equally Son is not expected to receive the homecoming hero treatment, which is a pity because he did so much to endear himself during his two-year stint at the club. Never mind that it had long been clear Son saw the Bundesliga as a stepping stone to the Premier League, the way that he left \u2013 with the elements of friction \u2013 jarred with his nice-guy persona.</p> <p>Son is one of the nice guys. He has been almost bashful in his post-match dealings with the media in England and it says much about him that he lives in an unprepossessing apartment in Barnet with his parents. His transfer fee to Tottenham of \u00a322m made him the most expensive Asian footballer of all time and he is surely his continent\u2019s most recognisable, at present. Yet he is well known for his down-to-earth nature and one story from his Leverkusen days sums it up.</p> <p>The area has a sizeable Korean community and, when Bayer signed Son from Hamburg for a then club record \u20ac10m, their interest was piqued. A lot of Korean supporters attended Leverkusen matches and they would wait for Son by his car afterwards. There would be queues of 60 or 70 metres, with the fans wanting photographs or signatures. Son always obliged. His mother and father, who would be with him, routinely helped out by taking the pictures or smoothing the shirts for him to sign.</p> <p>Leverkusen previously had Michael Ballack but it was a different era when the Germany midfielder was rising to prominence with them at the turn of the millennium. Son represents worldwide box-office and the club were not slow to cash in on his appeal. Weeks after his arrival, they had signed a three-year deal with the South Korean company, LG Electronics, to make them their main sponsor and Son was installed as a brand ambassador. LG did not renew with Leverkusen over this past summer, largely because Son had left.</p> <p>Bayer also toured South Korea, at LG\u2019s invitation, in the summer of 2014, when they played a friendly against FC Seoul \u2013 the club at which Son had started his career at youth level. The soundtrack to Son\u2019s every move during the trip was provided by thousands of screaming girls.</p> <p>Son has long hooked the brands. When he was at Hamburg, another South Korean company, Kumho Tyre \u2013 who had previously sponsored Manchester United during Park Ji-sung\u2019s time at Old Trafford \u2013 agreed a two-year deal with them. In July of this year, Kumho linked up with Tottenham for two years. Tottenham\u2019s main sponsor is AIA, the pan-Asian insurance group, although they were in place before Son\u2019s arrival, while the club made Fun88 their Asian gaming partner over the summer. Fun88 had previously worked with Tottenham between 2012 and 2014.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"022bb7df0ff06b5492cabeff62b14bb23cafdcf0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/022bb7df0ff06b5492cabeff62b14bb23cafdcf0/13_159_2979_1787/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Son Heung-min scored 29 goals in 87 appearances for Bayer Leverkusen \u2013 an impressive return for a wide attacker.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Son Heung-min scored 29 goals in 87 appearances for Bayer Leverkusen \u2013 an impressive return for a wide attacker.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lars Baron/Bongarts/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Son\u2019s association with Germany began when he was 16 and he swapped Seoul for the Hamburg academy \u2013 a move that advertised his determination to forge a successful career in Europe. He did not speak German or English when he arrived and the first year was tough.</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know anybody and no one came with me,\u201d Son said. \u201cMy parents came when I moved to England. I felt so alone but so humble, because everyone was helping me. Sometimes, I missed Korea. It\u2019s my home and everyone misses their home when they are not there. But I wanted to play professional football in Europe and this was what I had to do.\u201d</p> <p>He credits Ruud Van Nistelrooy with helping him to settle. The Holland striker moved to Hamburg when Son was 17 while another Dutchman, Rafael Van Der Vaart, would be an influence. Van Der Vaart signed for Hamburg in the summer of 2012. \u201cVan Nistelrooy helped me a lot,\u201d Son said. \u201cHe saw my first training session and he talked to me. He told me I was a good player. He gave me confidence and I want to thank him for that. Also, Van Der Vaart came and he helped me. He told me more about English football and how tough it was. I tried to learn from what he was saying.\u201d</p> <p>Son has always felt like a young man in a hurry. He learned German quickly and, at 18, he scored on his debut for Hamburg. At Leverkusen, he scored 29 goals in 87 appearances \u2013 an impressive return for a wide attacker \u2013 and there were memorable ones, not least the winner against Werder Bremen on the final day of the 2013-14 Bundesliga season. Bayer had needed to win in order to secure fourth place ahead of Wolfsburg.</p> <p>In the Champions League play off at the start of the following season, he scored vital goals against Copenhagen while he helped Leverkusen to finish fourth again in the league. In both of his full seasons at the club, they reached the last 16 of the Champions League.</p> <p>Son returns to Germany on the crest of a wave, having scored five goals for Tottenham so far this season and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/oct/02/heung-min-son-tottenham-manchester-city\">wowed, as a No9</a>, in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/02/tottenham-hotspur-manchester-city-premier-league-match-report\">the 2-0 home win against Manchester City</a> at the beginning of the month \u2013 a game that was attended by the Leverkusen manager, Roger Schmidt.</p> <p>Son has put his disappointments from the summer behind him, chiefly, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/28/ottenham-son-heung-min-south-korea-olympic-disappointment\">quarter-final exit from the Rio Olympics</a> he endured with South Korea at the hands of Honduras and the uncertainty over his club future. His travails last season were well documented. After a lively start, he was set back by a foot injury and he flitted in and out of Mauricio Pochettino\u2019s starting XI. He was ready to leave in August, with several clubs from the Bundesliga interested in him, but Pochettino said no.<br></p> <p>The Olympic heartbreak served to fire the storyline about Son\u2019s military service which, according to South Korean law, all able-bodied males must begin before they turn 28 and which lasts for 21 months. Had South Korea won a medal of any colour in Rio, the players would have been excused the mandatory tour.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/15/west-bromwich-albion-tottenham-hotspur-premier-league-match-report\">Dele Alli strikes late to earn Tottenham draw at West Bromwich Albion</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Instead the clock is ticking for Son, although he could yet gain exemption if he was to help his country win gold at the 2018 Asian Games. Tottenham have shut down questions on the subject and it has been possible to detect a nervousness about it from their side. However, it is understood, a solution is likely to be found that will not disrupt Son\u2019s football career. It could involve his service being postponed.</p> <p>Son did not go through pre-season at Tottenham last year \u2013 which is sometimes forgotten \u2013 as he joined them at the end of August, and he has benefited from working under Pochettino this time out. It was tougher than anything he had experienced in Germany; physically, he feels stronger. Moreover, the four matches he played at the Olympics helped him in terms of sharpness.</p> <p>The Leverkusen tie promises to stir the emotions. Son can remind the club of his quality.</p>",

Real tears have been shed and consciences examined.

Twenty-four hours later, on the night of 30 September, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/01/scottish-boxer-mike-towell-dies-after-bout\" title=\"\">Towell died from his&#xa0;injuries</a>.</p> <p>Williams had been in the corner for both bouts, acting as a second to his friends. The Welshman is a warm man, at least outside the ring, and he has been affected profoundly. His commitment to boxing has been tested \u2013 but it remains&#xa0;intact.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a6d89d3f6fb16268f3f32bab27f0f75b37c1931c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a6d89d3f6fb16268f3f32bab27f0f75b37c1931c/0_0_5136_3396/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Liam Williams\" width=\"1000\" height=\"661\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Liam Williams: \u2018There is more to life than boxing \u2013 as much as we all love it.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On a Thursday morning in Cardiff, Williams smacks precise combinations into the pads held by Lockett as the fighter stalks his trainer. In an empty gym, the force of Williams\u2019s punches is most evident when he hits the heavy black bags dangling from the rafters. Standing close to Williams, listening to the crack of his punching and seeing the big bag sag on its chain, it is easy to understand how a professional boxer\u2019s fists can cause fatal damage.</p> <p>After unwrapping his hands, Williams is soaked in sweat. He smiles as he remembers his perspiration at the Savoy. \u201cIt was nerve-racking and harder than fighting. I would get in the ring before doing that again. There were lots of big names there and I felt nervous when my name was called and everyone was on their feet clapping. I made a little speech but kept it short and sweet.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/apr/19/nick-blackwell-boxing-chris-eubank-jr-no-hard-feelings\">Nick Blackwell retires from boxing but tells Chris Eubank Jr \u2018no hard feelings\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Their memories of everything that happened to Blackwell and Towell remain raw.

Evans broke down at the funeral and <a href=\"http://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/boxing/emotional-moment-distraught-welsh-boxer-12025723\" title=\"\">was comforted by Towell\u2019s grieving family</a>.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s unusual for one terrible incident like this to happen in your career,\u201d Williams says. \u201cBut twice \u2013 and with the second happening six months later? It was horrible to see what happened to Mike \u2013 and Nick is my close mate. It really got to me.\u201d</p> <p>Blackwell\u2019s last fight, which Eubank dominated, was stopped in the 10th round when a grotesque swelling had formed over his left eye. After congratulating Eubank, his face etched in disappointment, Blackwell collapsed in Lockett\u2019s arms. He was oxygenated quickly and rushed to hospital. Blackwell remained in an induced coma while doctors attempted to reduce a severe bleed on his brain.</p> <p>Did Williams think he might lose his friend forever? \u201cDefinitely. When he was in a coma we didn\u2019t have so much hope. We didn\u2019t know what was going to happen. He could have come around and something was wrong with him. He could not have come back at all. It was very scary and we were heartbroken. But it was obviously a lot worse for Nick\u2019s family.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dc7a8ca396c49b1c9fc370f30a31bfe2e682d1f3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dc7a8ca396c49b1c9fc370f30a31bfe2e682d1f3/0_0_4968_3168/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Liam Williams trains at the Ufit gym in Cardiff\" width=\"1000\" height=\"638\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Liam Williams trains at the Ufit gym in Cardiff.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>How did Williams\u2019s girlfriend feel about boxing during those bleak days? \u201cEvie was good friends with Nick as well because we trained together. Nick was staying over in Cardiff and coming to visit \u2013 especially to see my daughter when she was born eight months ago. So Evie was devastated. We travelled to London a few times to visit him in hospital. The first time we walked in the room Evie couldn\u2019t stay. She had to leave because Nick had tubes coming from everywhere. It was tough. I would sit at the bedside and talk to him. He was sleeping hard \u2026 but I talked to him and a couple of times Nick squeezed my hand. That gave me hope.\u201d</p> <p>Did Williams consider quitting boxing? \u201cNo. It was very sad but you know the risks when you step inside the ropes. I was supposed to fight a week later but Nav Mansouri pulled out and that was a relief. I could have ended up losing because my mind was on Nick.\u201d</p> <p>Blackwell remains close to everyone in the Cardiff gym and he often works out alongside his friends. The extent of Blackwell\u2019s improvement is made clear by the fact he recently broke a gym record on one of the machines testing stamina. It seems as if Blackwell still loves boxing.</p> <p>\u201cYeah, he really does,\u201d Williams says. \u201cI think if it was allowed Nick would love to get his licence back and fight again. Of course I wouldn\u2019t want to see him fighting and Nick knows he could never do it. There is more to life than boxing \u2013 as much as we all love it. If I have any scares I wouldn\u2019t think twice about stopping. My health is more important.\u201d</p> <p>When Blackwell joined Williams, Lockett and Evans in Glasgow for the Towell bout late last month, tragedy struck with terrible finality. It is not easy to relive the fight but, because he is so honest and open, Williams explains their tangled feelings. \u201cAt first we were looking forward to the trip but then it turned out to be devastating. These two guys were both known to be ferocious punchers. We expected a good fight.\u201d</p> <p>Evans was meant to box sensibly \u2013 but he knocked Towell down early in the fight and the war began. \u201cAfter three rounds I thought Dale had lost it because Mike was coming on strong. It wasn\u2019t looking good and me and Gary were thinking: \u2018Dale\u2019s not going to get through this.\u2019 But they were both very tired. Dale\u2019s not known as a good boxer but he started jabbing his head off. That was a sign Mike was in trouble.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/03/mike-towell-boxing-dale-evans-heartbroken\">Dale Evans \u2018heartbroken\u2019 after death of opponent Mike Towell</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A few hours later, after Towell had been carried on a stretcher from the ring, Lockett was told the shattering truth: \u201cThe kid\u2019s in a bad way. He\u2019s not going to make it.\u201d</p> <p>The trainer\u2019s face scrunches up with hurt as he remembers having to break the news to a distraught Evans. Lockett looks up: \u201cI knew what to expect after what happened to Nick. But I\u2019m so proud of Dale and the compassion he has shown.\u201d</p> <p>Williams has decided that he will not work the corner again. \u201cIt plays on my mind. It upset me too much. But I will keep fighting. This is what I do. I also believe in my ability and I don\u2019t think something like this would happen to me. I know nobody does but I have complete trust in Gary. If I was ever in big trouble I know Gary would look after me.\u201d</p> <p>Before he became such a promising boxer, Williams was a roofer in Rhondda. \u201cI enjoyed being with good people but it was never great money. It was hard work in all sorts of weather but no one has it easy in Rhondda. People say it\u2019s a tough place but for me it\u2019s a very tight community. People there will tell you that, whatever I achieve, I\u2019ve not changed.\u201d</p> <p>Williams \u201calways loved a scrap\u201d and, rather than being a slinky amateur, \u201cI wanted to get stuck in. I was walking through people, throwing bombs. Gary put plenty of time into teaching me to box more. People say to Gary that I can really punch but he says: \u2018Yeah, but you haven\u2019t seen how well he can box.\u2019 I\u2019ve just never been in a fight where I\u2019ve needed to go on the back foot and box.

It was in the Aberdare sports centre. I fought Ryan Clark and he\u2019d had [49] fights, so he could look after himself. He was in the changing room next door, which was a squash court, and he shouted over the top to me: \u2018I\u2019ve been in with the best, boy. I hope you\u2019re ready, boy.\u2019 I fronted it as if I didn\u2019t care but deep down I was shitting myself. Any boxer who says he\u2019s not nervous is lying.</p> <p>\u201cOnce the fight started I won every round. I outboxed him and afterwards he reeled off the big names he\u2019d fought and he said: \u2018I think you\u2019re the best.\u2019 It does get easier but even when you\u2019re stopping people you go in thinking: \u2018What if I lose \u2026 what if I get knocked out?\u2019 But as soon as the bell goes I\u2019m always confident.\u201d</p> <p>Williams was tested most when, after an unsuccessful operation on his right hand in 2014, his career looked in jeopardy. \u201cI went to see a consultant in Manchester and he said: \u2018You\u2019re done. Start looking for a new line of work.\u2019 I was heartbroken for months.</p> <p>\u201cBut Evie\u2019s father helped me. He said: \u2018I\u2019ve been looking on the internet and there\u2019s a guy who is supposed to be very good in Cardiff.\u2019 He had operated on Joe Calzaghe.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>They felt I was good enough to help Kell Brook get ready for the biggest fight of his life. I held my own</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Lockett\u2019s father-in-law, a retired orthopaedic surgeon, arranged a consultation with the specialist. \u201cI was excited again,\u201d Williams says, \u201cand the doctor said: \u2018I am sure we can make a good go of it.\u2019 I came through surgery and we\u2019ve never looked back. I\u2019ve had seven stoppages on the bounce and I\u2019m looking to continue that.\u201d</p> <p>Williams was asked to help Kell Brook prepare for his impressive performance last month <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/10/kell-brook-title-bid-ended-gennady-golovkin\" title=\"\">against the imposing Gennady Golovkin</a>. \u201cThat was a shock to me \u2013 but they obviously felt I was good enough to help Kell get ready for the biggest fight of his life. I came out with lots of credit and held my own \u2013 if not even more than that. It told me I belong at top level \u2013 and I could be offered a world title fight next year.\u201d</p> <p>Lockett stresses the need for caution and Williams nods. \u201cI\u2019ll be guided by Gary. We\u2019ve been through so much this year and there\u2019s always danger in boxing. But I\u2019m ready to move up.\u201d</p> <p>Williams\u2019s training session ended an hour earlier and, while we have been talking, the sweat has dried and his skin has turned cold. The young fighter stands up. He keeps talking but, to get warm, his feet skip lightly on the spot. Williams snaps out a jab for fun, smiling and talking, looking once more like a fighter who finds so much life and hope in boxing.</p>",
  "<p>Rosemary and I have been having loads of rows lately, often about what day it is, or when we are doing what, and whether the other remembers.

Sometimes, I forget her doctor\u2019s/hospital appointments, probably because she has had heart failure for so long and the appointments are so far apart, and are often only appointments to see whether she needs a&#xa0;proper consultant\u2019s appointment, and so hardly worth remembering.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/sep/26/the-afterlife-the-only-reincarnation-i-want-is-as-fertiliser-for-the-grass\">The afterlife?

She\u2019s at her best when she\u2019s responding genuinely in the moment. She\u2019s like a kid in a sweet shop, which is lovely to see. And her demonstrations during Len\u2019s Lens are always touching: she\u2019s not as ballroom-dancey as the other judges with her classical background. She has different expectations, perhaps closer to those of the audience.

Speaking of which, we had the first outing of the vinegary nuts this week, in association with Laura and Giovanni. (\u201cI\u2019ll pickle me walnuts if you\u2019re in the dance-off this week.\u201d) </p> <p>Len was kind to Ed Balls this week, which seemed like a strategic move. In the coming weeks, the judges will either double down and go in harsh on Balls to try and force him out with the power of low marks. Or they\u2019ll go soft to avoid goading the audience into anti-expert voting. (And we all know how that ends...)</p> <h2>Craig: the great choreographer trapped inside a pantomime dame</h2> <p>Aside from a brief contre-temps with Len over Naga for being contrary in his charleston evaluations, Craig was relatively relaxed and restrained. Again, I think this is strategic. He showed what he really thought of Ed Balls by flashing the 2 paddle. But he wasn\u2019t unkind or acid in his comments, which he easily could have been. Eventually he\u2019ll get frustrated, cave and lose it. Claws out next week? <br></p> <h2>This week\u2019s verdict</h2> <p>It\u2019s open war between Danny and Ore, as declared by the judges. Who will crack first? Or will they both up their game? I\u2019m not sure this macho gauntlet-throwing is healthy and I\u2019m worried Ore wants it too badly and the voting audience doesn\u2019t find that attractive. Laura and Anastacia are still vulnerable, both having been in the dance-off. Ed Balls continues his elevation to honorary king. Long may he reign.</p>",

  "<p>The study of psychology is facing a crisis. A lot of research <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/aug/27/study-delivers-bleak-verdict-on-validity-of-psychology-experiment-results\"> doesn\u2019t show the same results</a> when the experiment is repeated, and it is critical we address this problem. But the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/2014/dec/17/ref-2014-why-is-it-such-a-big-deal\">Research Excellence Framework</a> has led to a research culture which is suffocating attempts to stabilise psychology in particular, and science in general. </p> <p>The Ref encourages universities to push for groundbreaking, novel, and exciting research in the form of 4* papers, but it does not reward the efforts of those who replicate studies. As universities gear up for the next Ref submission in 2021, many researchers will not even consider attempts to replicate results. </p> <h2>False information</h2> <p>The point of replicating a study is to test whether a statistically significant result will appear again if the experiment is repeated. Of course, a similar result may not appear \u2013 casting into question the validity of the results from the first experiment. </p> <p>Last year, the <a href=\"https://osf.io/vmrgu/\">Open Science Collaboration</a> attempted to replicate 100 studies from highly ranked psychological journals. While 97% of the original studies had a statistically significant result, just 36% of the replications had the same outcome. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/2016/jun/08/scientists-arent-superheroes-failure-is-a-valid-result\">Scientists aren't superheroes \u2013 failure is a valid result</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Equally worrying: when an effect did appear, it was often much <a href=\"http://science.sciencemag.org/content/349/6251/aac4716.full\">smaller than previously thought</a>. </p> <p>Recent data calls into question some widely influential findings in psychological science. These problems are not confined to psychology however \u2013 many findings published in scientific literature may <a href=\"http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.0020124\">actually be false</a>.</p> <p>Science is supposed to be self-correcting and reproducibility is a cornerstone of the scientific method. Yet, in the top 100 journals between 1900 and 2012, just<a href=\"http://pps.sagepub.com/content/7/6/537\"> 1.6% of studies</a> were replications. We simply aren\u2019t invested in replicating findings. We all want to be good researchers and understand more about how the world works. So why are we so reluctant to check our conclusions are valid?</p> <h2>No incentive</h2> <p>One problem is the sheer volume of work \u2013 new publications emerge in the millions each year. But a larger issue is the systems we carry out our research in: US universities have a tenure model, where job security is achieved through high numbers of publications. In Australia, prestigious research fellowships are similarly focused on a \u201cpublish or perish\u201d mentality.</p> <p>Worryingly, many academics admit to engaging <a href=\"http://pss.sagepub.com/content/23/5/524\">in at least one </a>questionable research practice in order to achieve publication. Examples of this include: coming up with a hypotheses after data is collected, stopping collecting data when an effect appears in case it disappears later, or only reporting the significant effects from collected data. Others simply fabricate data \u2013 Dutch psychologist Diederik Stapel shockingly falsified data from<a href=\"http://retractionwatch.com/2015/12/08/diederik-stapel-now-has-58-retractions/\"> more than 50 studies</a>.</p> <p> In the UK, the Ref ranks the published works of researchers according to their originality (how novel is the research?), significance (does it have practical or commercial importance?), and rigour (is the research technically sound?). Outputs are then awarded one to four stars. </p> <p>While research publications with 1* rankings are only recognised nationally for their originality, significance, and rigour, 4* rankings are considered world-leading. The cumulative total of 3* and 4* papers determines research funding allocation and has a knock-on effect on institutional position in league tables and therefore attractiveness to students. Obviously, the more publications the better.</p> <h2>Novelty bias</h2> <p>On the face of it, the Ref works quite well because it rewards quality work \u2013 it is better to publish fewer articles containing highly original and significant work. Those who do criticise it argue that the assessment process is overly <a href=\"http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2011/06/10/ref-alternative-harzing-google-scholar/\">complex and expensive</a> and that universities can, and do, <a href=\"https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/twenty-per-cent-contracts-rise-in-run-up-to-ref/2007670.article\">game the system</a>. </p> <p>But we argue that these criticisms miss a bigger and more fundamental issue: the Ref completely undermines our efforts to produce a reliable body of knowledge. </p> <p>Why? The focus on originality and accessibility \u2013 publications exploring new areas of research using new paradigms, and avoiding testing well-established theories \u2013 is the exact opposite of what science needs to be doing to solve the troubling replication crisis. According to Ref standards, replicating an already published piece of work is simply uninteresting.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/2014/dec/15/research-excellence-framework-five-reasons-not-fit-for-purpose\">Five reasons why the REF is not fit for purpose\u202c\u202c\u202c</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A BMJ study has shown that in science abstracts published between 1974 and 2015, the use of the words \u201cgroundbreaking\u201d, \u201cinnovative\u201d, and \u201cnovel\u201d <a href=\"http://www.bmj.com/content/351/bmj.h6467\">increased by 2500%</a>. This reflects a cultural shift in language, encouraged by systems like the Ref, rather than a change in science itself.</p> <p> With the next Ref just four years away, many researchers are effectively faced with a choice: be a good scientist, or be a successful academic who gets funding and a promotion. </p> <h2>Potential solutions</h2> <p>Researchers in psychology \u2013 the discipline truly at the heart of the replication crisis \u2013 are leading the way for change.

  "<p>Tesla Motors has been asked by the German transport minister to not use the word \u201cautopilot\u201d in its advertising, as doing so may suggest to drivers that they do not need to pay attention to the road.</p> <p>The minster, Alexander Dobrindt, told Reuters that his office made the request \u201cto no longer use the misleading term for the driver assistance system of the car\u201d.</p> <p>But Tesla defended its use of the word, arguing that it should be understood by analogy to aeroplanes.</p> <p>A Tesla spokesperson said: \u201cJust as in an aeroplane, when used properly, Autopilot reduces driver workload and provides an added layer of safety when compared to purely manual driving.\u201d</p> <p>On Friday, the Federal Motor Transport Authority \u2013 which reports to Dobrindt \u2013 also wrote to owners of Tesla cars, warning them that their vehicles could not be operated without their constant attention and that under traffic regulations they must remain alert.</p> <p>Autopilot is Tesla\u2019s brand name for a suite of features in its Model S vehicles which provide varying levels of driving automation. The car can automatically manage speed, braking to avoid collisions, and change lanes when instructed. It can also park itself, and leave a bay parking space on command.</p> <p>While the features collectively entail a high level of automation, the car is not fully self-driving. This has caused accidents, including one fatality in the US this year. A Tesla Model S with autopilot turned on hit the side of a truck, after neither the software nor the car\u2019s driver saw it crossing a junction.</p> <p>After the accident, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jul/01/tesla-driver-killed-autopilot-self-driving-car-harry-potter\">reports emerged</a> that the victim, Joshua Brown, 40, had been watching a film while he was supposed to be in control of the car.</p> <p>In <a href=\"https://www.tesla.com/en_GB/blog/tragic-loss\">a statement following Brown\u2019s death</a>, released at the end of June, the company emphasised the need for drivers to be in control of the car even as Autopilot does the brunt of the work. </p> <p>\u201cIt is important to note that Tesla disables Autopilot by default and requires explicit acknowledgement that the system is new technology and still in a public beta phase before it can be enabled,\u201d the company said. \u201cWhen drivers activate Autopilot, the acknowledgment box explains, among other things, that Autopilot \u2018is an assist feature that requires you to keep your hands on the steering wheel at all times,\u2019 and that \u2018you need to maintain control and responsibility for your vehicle\u2019 while using it.</p> <p>\u201cAdditionally, every time that Autopilot is engaged, the car reminds the driver to \u2018Always keep your hands on the wheel. Be prepared to take over at any time.\u2019 The system also makes frequent checks to ensure that the driver\u2019s hands remain on the wheel and provides visual and audible alerts if hands-on is not detected. It then gradually slows down the car until hands-on is detected again.\u201d</p> <p>In September, a Tesla electric <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/sep/30/tesla-autopilot-bus-crash-germany\">car crashed into a tourist bus</a> on a motorway in northern Germany, lightly injuring the driver, who said he had activated the vehicle\u2019s autopilot system.</p> <p>At the time, Tesla said the driver had confirmed the autopilot was \u201cfunctioning properly and \u2026 was unrelated to the accident.\u201d</p> <ul> <li><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/sep/15/autopilot-supplier-disowns-tesla-for-pushing-the-envelope-on-safety\">Autopilot supplier disowns Tesla for \u2018pushing the envelope on safety\u2019</a></strong><br></li> <li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/sep/20/tesla-model-s-chinese-hack-remote-control-brakes\"><strong>Team of hackers take remote control of Tesla Model S from 12 miles away</strong></a></li> </ul>",

Housing prices in Beijing have skyrocketed in the last decade, and continue to soar inside the fifth ring road.

He has lamented the lack of specialist No7s in the Premiership, not persuaded by Matt Kvesic and Luke Wallace, and Saracens played <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/14/schalk-burger-saracens-south-africa\">the seasoned Schalk Burger</a>, who often wore 7 for South Africa but played at 6, in the position at Toulon. The Springbok was outstanding from the start, winning turnovers and acting as a link between forwards and backs. The tweak in the law at the breakdown, which prevents defenders from planting their hands in front of the ball, has redefined the role and made the breakdown a collective effort. Burger used his nous honed from 12 years as an international player to invariably put himself in the right place. Jones is considering playing Maro Itoje, who has spent this season in the Sarries\u2019 second row, at 7 in the opening international against South Africa next month, and the lock can only benefit from playing alongside someone so skilled. The number a player wears is becoming increasingly irrelevant as Mako Vunipola showed in a series of bursts that made him look like a centre. It is the whole that counts and the back row relish was supplied by Burger. <strong>Paul Rees</strong></p> <blockquote> <p><em><strong>\u2022 </strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/15/toulon-saracens-european-rugby-champions-cup-match-report\">Match report: Toulon 23-31 Saracens </a><br></em><em><strong>\u2022 </strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/15/saracens-toulon-\">\u2018It was a performance that had everything\u2019 says Saracens\u2019 McCall</a></em></p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fe940fd97a9865f7ff8678f02438cf567c17c925\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fe940fd97a9865f7ff8678f02438cf567c17c925/767_317_3724_2235/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Schalk Burger\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Schalk Burger charges upfield during the European Rugby Champions Cup match between Toulon and Saracens,</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Rogers/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>2) Harsh words needed as Exeter are drubbed</h2> <p>Rob Baxter was as angry after his side\u2019s 35-8 home drubbing by Clermont as at any stage in Exeter\u2019s recent history. He will demand a similar reaction from his players in training this week, with the Chiefs prospects of European pool qualification already looking less than promising. England lock Geoff Parling, for one, is in full agreement. \u201cIt\u2019s not just this game to be honest. We\u2019ve not been firing this season and we need to work out why and do something about it. Even if we\u2019d won today the start of the season has not been good enough. Maybe we need to have a few harsh words. We\u2019re a good team and we should be doing well but it feels like we\u2019re far away, especially at home. We\u2019ve let our fans down and we\u2019ve let each other down. We\u2019ve got to go to Ulster and win.\u201d To add to a downcast mood at Sandy Park, there were several blocks of empty seats and the attendance fell below 10,000. Kicking off at 5.30pm on a Sunday night may suit television but the traditional rugby fan does not appear to relish it. <strong>Robert Kitson</strong></p> <blockquote> <p><em>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/16/exeter-clermont-auvergne-european-rugby-champions-cup-match-report\">Match report: Exeter 8-35 Clermont Auvergne</a></em></p> </blockquote> <h2>3) Montpellier manners leave much to be desired</h2> <p>Franklin\u2019s Gardens is one of those stadiums that deals in silence when a kicker lines up his shot at goal. So it was all the more obvious when a voice shouted \u201cMiss!\u201d just as Stephen Myler struck his attempted conversion of Northampton\u2019s early try against Montpellier. We assumed the cry had come from someone in the crowd, but Nigel Owens knew better. Myler pulled the conversion wide, and Owens ordered it be retaken and admonished Frans Steyn, who had tried to charge it down. It turned out the Springbok World Cup winner had been the one shouting as Myler kicked. It was a remarkably childish trick to have resorted to, almost comically so. Perhaps this is regular practice in the Top 14, where crowds are often less reverent of the kicker, or even just regular practice among Montpellier ranks. Either way, the ploy didn\u2019t work. Myler landed the conversion at the second attempt \u2013 and those two points proved the difference between the sides, come the end. <strong>Michael Aylwin</strong></p> <blockquote> <p>\u2022 <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/15/northampton-montpellier-european-champions-cup-rugby-match-report\">Match report: Northampton 16-14 Montpellier</a></em> </p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cdb8a6ec10763a2d6a89f4e06b4aedb63a120954\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cdb8a6ec10763a2d6a89f4e06b4aedb63a120954/156_27_1545_927/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Frans Steyn\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Frans Steyn went over for a try but was hauled up for a lack of respect too.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Henry Browne/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>4) Leicester\u2019s shaky defence shouldn\u2019t detract from Glasgow</h2> <p>Leicester have never conceded more points in the 20-year history of European club rugby than they did on Friday night. That fact alone will prompt plenty of soul-searching at Welford Road, where consistent success is never an optional accessory. In truth Richard Cockerill\u2019s side have been shaky away away from home all season, losing in Glasgow and Sale and scraping home in Gloucester and Newcastle, and their defence has been less than Tigerish at times. Nothing, however, should detract from the quality of Glasgow\u2019s performance, with prop Gordon Reid suggesting the Warriors had been motivated by some of Leicester\u2019s pre-match comments. \u201cWe want to be the best in Europe and it hurts us sometimes when we get put down,\u201d suggested Reid. \u201cLeicester were saying in the papers \u2018We\u2019re going to dominate them in the pack\u2019. It irritates you a wee bit.\u201d Reid also felt Matt Toomua was fortunate only to be yellow-carded for a tip-tackle on Finn Russell, who saved the Australian from a red card by putting an arm down to break his fall. \u201cHe was quite lucky to get a yellow card. We can only do what the referee says but, yeah, I thought it was quite an easy call for him to make. They came up here to try and bully us a wee bit... it gave us the kind of kick we needed and we pushed on from there. As a prop there\u2019s nothing better than a wee fight, a bit of fisticuffs. It brings me back to my days at Ayr.\u201d <strong>Robert Kitson</strong></p> <blockquote> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/14/glasgow-leicester-european-rugby-champions-cup-match-report\"><em>\u2022 Match report: Glasgow 42-13 Leicester </em></a></p> </blockquote> <h2>5) Cipriani keeps knocking at the door</h2> <p>At the centre of Wasps\u2019 82-14 destruction of a dire Zebre was Danny Cipriani. His no-look pass to set up Joe Simpson for Wasps\u2019 third try, taking two opponents out of the game in the process, was sublime and typical of the creativity with which he instigated so much of the play against the Italian side. From a player who continues to harbour hopes of an England return, this was another small statement. \u201cSome players can only be a No1,\u201d Eddie Jones explained last month when asked about the 28-year-old. \u201cWe see George Ford and Owen Farrell as one and two. They are the heartbeat of the side. They can organise the team and they are tactically smart. Danny has got to be able to show that he can be No1. He likes to be the main man. And when he plays well enough to be No1, he\u2019ll be in the squad.\u201d Cipriani could not have played much better in this first half against Zebre and if he consistently hits those heights he will be difficult to ignore. <strong>Lawrence Ostlere</strong></p> <blockquote> <p>\u2022 <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/15/european-champions-cup-rugby-roundup-connacht-toulouse\">European Champions Cup round-up</a></em></p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c8fcfbef2208832ba2df2586cde02decad37ffa2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c8fcfbef2208832ba2df2586cde02decad37ffa2/0_271_4248_2548/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Danny Cipriani\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Danny Cipriani\u2019s creativity was at the heart of Wasps\u2019 win.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Warren Little/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>6) Sale have one match to avoid a whitewash</h2> <p>There is a danger we are getting ahead of ourselves here, but defeat at Parc y Scarlets means Sale will surely now struggle to avoid the wooden spoon in the toughest of groups.

Sale\u2019s miserable away form continued in a slug-fest in Wales; the Scarlets fully deserved their win and late yellow cards, for dangerous tackles, for Ross Harrison and Andrei Ostrikov epitomised what a mess Steve Diamond\u2019s side have become on the road.

However, Treviso is one thing \u2013 stepping in for tight-hamstring-afflicted Jonny Sexton in a European Champions Cup opener against the 2014-15 Top 14 champions is quite another. No one seemed to have told Carbery, though, as he ran Castres ragged in Leinster\u2019s bonus-point win. True, he was given an armchair ride by a dominant pack in this otherwise uninspiring match, but those dummies, those shimmies, and those steps, if not the scorching pace, were on display to settle the nerves of those who worried when Ian Madigan hopped off to Bordeaux-B\u00e8gles at the end of last season. <strong>DL</strong></p> <blockquote> <p>\u2022 <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/15/european-champions-cup-rugby-roundup-connacht-toulouse\">European Champions Cup round-up</a></em></p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8d5a7d530a2db78106bc3f2ed77f5210729783d3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8d5a7d530a2db78106bc3f2ed77f5210729783d3/0_172_5078_3047/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Joey Carbery\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Leinster\u2019s Joey Carbery is tackled by Castres\u2019 Rory Kockott.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dickson/Rex Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>8) Connacht recover to make statement</h2> <p>A Connacht victory seemed an unlikely prospect at half-time in Galway, when the Pro12 champions trailed Toulouse 21-11, but Tiernan O\u2019Halloran and Bundee Aki scored second-half tries and Craig Ronaldson\u2019s cool kick from the sideline sealed a memorable 23-21 win. Connacht have given themselves hope of reaching the quarter-finals and must now capitalise; the format of the competition, with three runners-up from the five pools progressing, means bonus points are critical and even points difference could be a factor. Last year this played into the hands of Stade Fran\u00e7ais, who benefitted from having the Italian strugglers Benetton Treviso in their group; Treviso picked up no points at all and the French side took the full 10 available from their contests. Treviso\u2019s fellow Italians Zebre are in the same pool as Pat Lam\u2019s men and showed in their first match of this year\u2019s tournament that they could go the way of Treviso, having been thrashed 82-14 by Wasps. Connacht go to Zebre next and must sense an opportunity not just to win but rack up tries if they are to emerge on the other side of the group stage. <strong>LO</strong></p> <blockquote> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/15/european-champions-cup-rugby-roundup-connacht-toulouse\"><em>European Champions Cup round-up</em></a></p> </blockquote> <h2><br></h2> <h2>9) Madigan edges No10 battle as Ulster rue late collapse</h2> <p>Sometimes in European contests sub-plots are tricky to identify, sometimes they are staring you in the face and in this instance, the clash of No10s was ladened with narrative. Ian Madigan v Paddy Jackson \u2013 fly-halves who have spent their Ireland careers waiting in the wings behind Jonny Sexton, even if the former was often deployed outside him at Leinster. Between them they have 46 caps but only 14 of those have been starts and it is a place on Joe Schmidt\u2019s bench that the pair are vying for this autumn \u2013 Leinster are hopeful Sexton will recover from his hamstring injury in time to face Montpellier at the weekend. Jackson appears to be in the box-seat \u2013 Madigan reportedly facing an uphill battle to convince Schmidt he warrants selection while playing at Bordeaux \u2013 but Madigan who edged the duel on Sunday even if he had been replaced well before the French side\u2019s flurry of late tries. Of more concern for Jackson will be that Ulster ended up empty-handed despite leading 13-9 with seven minutes to go. Ulster failed to reach the knockout stages last season despite impressive away wins against Toulouse and Oyonnax, having started their campaign with a 27-9 defeat by Saracens in which they led 9-5 just before the hour.

I was present as a student, and he shared many insights with me. It\u2019s one of the reasons I became so interested in urban matters.<br></p> <p>At university, I had believed that socialism would efficiently achieve high saving rates and high economic development \u2013 and produce greater equality. In fact I discovered it produced neither, so I became more and more interested in human settlements. I realised the way we build cities is much more important for the future happiness of people than economic development. For example, if we are able to save a couple of hectares of land for a public park, it can make people happier for thousands of years to come.</p> <p><strong>Forty years on, what is the most important issue cities need to tackle today?</strong><br></p> <p>Simply, land. Private property and the commercial market does not work in the case of land around growing cities \u2013 because when prices increase, the supply does not increase. It\u2019s not like the market for potatoes, or ketchup.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If all citizens are equal, then the public good should prevail over private interest</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The way cities grow should not be dictated by private interests, but by the government, which can identify the best places for development \u2013 to minimise transport distances and allow great parks to be created. Government intervention in land is crucial for the creation of good cities.</p> <p> Wherever possible, we must protect the principal of the public good prevailing over private interests \u2013 meaning the power of \u201c<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eminent_domain\">eminent domain</a>\u201d should be imposed frequently. It is crucial to maintain control of the land, and to be able to acquire land or buildings to public spaces, parks, roads and housing projects for the city.</p> <p>There should never be private waterfronts in a democratic urban area. We are talking about the basic democratic principle which states that all citizens are equal. And if all citizens are equal, then all of them have the right to the same amount of road space, and the public good should prevail over private interest, and we should never have a golf course when there are no parks around.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f19c929db0b03d856a63edfcb88a6c426d5bd2f0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f19c929db0b03d856a63edfcb88a6c426d5bd2f0/0_3_2784_1670/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Enrique Pe\u00f1alosa\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Enrique Pe\u00f1alosa\u2019s father organised the first Habitat conference in 1976.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Guillermo Legaria/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>You have long pioneered the importance of cycling and public transport in Bogot\u00e1. Do you feel vindicated by what you\u2019re seeing in cities around the world today?</strong><br></p> <p> When we introduced <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/blog/bogota-empowering-citizens-to-cycle\">bicycle paths in Bogot\u00e1 nearly 20 years ago</a>, when I was mayor here the first time, it was seen as a crazy idea. Back then, there were no bikeways in London, Paris, Madrid or New York. Now, of course, so many people are interested in this movement \u2013 particularly young people.</p> <p> Cities that move by bicycle and public transport are more democratic, more egalitarian. In a \u201cdeveloping country\u201d, a protected bikeway is not just a way of keeping the cyclist safe; it is a symbol that shows that a citizen riding a $50 bicycle is equally important to one driving a $50,000 car.</p> <p><strong>Yet most cities are still horribly clogged with traffic \u2026</strong><br></p> <p> Mobility is a very peculiar challenge for a city \u2013 different from health or education \u2013 because it\u2019s one problem that tends to get worse as societies get richer. But above all, we must understand that an advanced city is not one where poor residents use cars, but one where rich residents use public transport.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/oct/13/utopian-future-lagos-what-african-cities-really-need-un-habitat-3\">I dream of a utopian Lagos \u2013 but here's what African cities really need to prosper</a> </p> </aside>  <p>If all citizens are equal, then somebody who is walking or on a bike has a right to the same amount of road space as somebody in a Rolls-Royce or luxury car. And a bus with 150 passengers has a right to 150 times more road space than a car with one passenger. Which means we should give exclusive lanes to buses and create Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) systems; it\u2019s the only solution.</p> <p>In Bogot\u00e1, our BRT has the same speed and the same capacity as a subway; indeed, we move more passengers per hour than any subway in Europe. And in the future, we will ensure \u2013 either via the new subway or BRT lines \u2013 that more than 80% of the city\u2019s population lives less than 1km from a mass transit line.<br></p> <p>Bogot\u00e1 has many problems and many failings, but one thing that is advanced here is that everybody accepts that buses should have exclusive lanes in every important road. Nobody questions that \u2013 even the people in cars who don\u2019t like it, they don\u2019t dare say it publicly.</p> <p>The whole challenge of urban mobility is not an engineering challenge but a political one. Today, it\u2019s almost as unjust and absurd to see a bus in a traffic jam as it was, a century or so ago, not to allow women to vote.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a0237fcc819ae4979168eb8d8c9bcf1b269beb78\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a0237fcc819ae4979168eb8d8c9bcf1b269beb78/0_193_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cycling in Bogota\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Cities that move by bicycle and public transport are more democratic, more egalitarian,\u2019 Pe\u00f1alosa says.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Xinhua/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>What do you think makes a good city?</strong><br></p> <p>I would say that a good city is one that is good for its most vulnerable citizens: for the poor, the elderly, for children and women. Crime-prevention is crucial in this, because normally when there is too much crime, those most affected are women, children or the elderly.</p> <p>If you find trout in a mountain stream, it means the water is very pure, because the trout is a very delicate fish, susceptible to dirty water and a lack of oxygen. This is known as a \u201cspecies indicator\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If women feel comfortable walking at night in a city, that's a good sign</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In the same way, I have always said that a species indicator for a good city is to see children by themselves in a street, or elderly people, people in wheelchairs, or women by themselves. If women feel comfortable walking at night in a city, this is a good sign.</p> <p>Conversely, crime is a huge problem for cities because it kills public space. I like to say that when shopping malls replace public space as a meeting place for people, it\u2019s a symptom that the city is ill.</p> <p><strong>What should the priority be for everyone gathering in Quito for Habitat III? </strong><br></p> <p> The main urban challenges of course come in developing-country cities, which are growing very rapidly. Even in a Latin American city such as Bogot\u00e1, in a country like Colombia which is already largely urbanised [about 75-80% urban] \u2013 even here, the built area of the city will more than double over the next 40 years.</p> <p>But in India, Asia and Africa, the built area of cities will increase by a multiple of 10 or more over the next 50 years \u2013 and therefore, I believe the biggest challenges are those cities that are yet to be built. </p> <p>These are not only the biggest challenges but the biggest possibilities, because we can make cities that are totally different \u2013 and better than those that exist today.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e6ef60229af774b0c2ed489d750df6626559cb1f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e6ef60229af774b0c2ed489d750df6626559cb1f/0_0_5130_3407/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Transit line in Bogota\" width=\"1000\" height=\"664\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pe\u00f1alosa hopes that in the future, 80% of the city\u2019s population will live less than 1km away from a BRT line.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Coletti/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I would say there is not one developing-country city with more than 50% of streets where someone in a wheelchair can go from one corner to the other. In most of these cities, it\u2019s less than 10% of their streets.</p> <p>The biggest problem for cities has to do with equity: the right to have access to a park, the right to have access to transportation, to have access not just to the obvious things \u2013 health, food, education \u2013 but also to sports facilities and music lessons, to green spaces, and things like this.<br></p> <p><strong>Should cities have more control over their own destiny?</strong><br></p> <p>Many people say that cities should be given more control by their national governments \u2013 but I think what\u2019s even worse than having governments controlling cities is having a myriad of municipalities, each one doing whatever they want. It\u2019s completely mad.</p> <p> In Colombia, we have a constitution which gives a lot of independence to municipalities. If they are located exactly where a city needs to grow, they can simply decide \u201cno\u201d. And so that city is instead forced to grow very far away, in a low-density suburban development. </p> <p>The important thing in the relationship between national and local government is that we redistribute resources and responsibilities in a rational way. We must create institutions where you can really plan a large city well, and redistribute income from rich areas to poor areas.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/oct/12/global-rise-female-mayors\">Can cities be feminist?

But I believe that conception is too Euro-centric; too \u201cadvanced city-centric\u201d, because I think developing-country cities which have not yet been built could be much better than London or Paris or New York.</p> <p>For example, they could be criss-crossed by hundreds of kilometres of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenway_(landscape)\">greenways</a>. For London, say, it is impossible to have 2,000km of greenways criss-crossing it in every direction \u2013 it\u2019s too late. But it\u2019s very easy for the African and Asian cities that are yet to be built to have this.</p> <p>There are so many possibilities to conceive a different kind of metropolis, for cities that are yet to be built. This is something you cannot do in New York or Paris, but it\u2019s very easy to do in the new urban areas that are going to be built in Asia and African cities, and even in some parts of Latin America.</p> <p>Right now, most developing-country cities really are not places for happy life; they are not places where rich and poor meet together in public spaces. They are very far from what good European cities are \u2013 and even further from the better cities that we could be making now.</p> <p><em>Enrique Pe\u00f1alosa is the current mayor of Bogot\u00e1.

The 21st century is fully omniscreen, with everyone from toddlers to pensioners consuming programmes on phone, tablet or laptop. So surely the next great leap will involve some paradigm-smashing tech advance? Not according to Dr Matthew Jones, senior lecturer in cinema and TV at Leicester\u2019s De Montfort University. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of excitement about hardware, things like 4K and VR, but I\u2019m not convinced,\u201d he says. \u201cAny technological shift that is isolating rather than inclusive, like having to wear 3D goggles, just goes against the social nature of TV. Sooner or later you hit a point where TV stops being TV.\u201d</p> <p>The really interesting work, he argues, is happening in AI. \u201cData analytics isn\u2019t particularly sexy but the sheer amount of information being harvested by providers like Netflix and Amazon is incredible. We might seem to spend a lot of time listlessly scrolling through menus but it is possible to imagine an automated algorithm or AI that will be able to analyse and predict our personal preferences in a much more nuanced way.\u201d Truly optimal results would be achieved by obliterating the data and content barriers between rival providers: imagine one monolithic telly entity with access to everything. But doesn\u2019t that sound like the sort of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/feb/24/2000ad-35-future-comic\">evil megacorp you once read about in 2000AD</a>? \u201cWe tend to imagine sci-fi futures as dismal but it doesn\u2019t have to be Black Mirror or Minority Report,\u201d says Dr Jones. \u201cThat does ourselves a disservice.

A lot of agencies like to pretend this doesn\u2019t exist any more; it does. Companies celebrated for their inclusive hiring policies and quotas to ensure female representation at management level also employ an overwhelmingly female battalion of PAs, secretaries and receptionists. This isn\u2019t always because hiring managers are discriminating against male candidates. Often candidates think these roles are woman dominated and, in turn, the available candidate pool reflects that.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/may/11/receptionist-sent-home-pwc-not-wearing-high-heels-pwc-nicola-thorp\">Receptionist 'sent home from PwC for not wearing high heels'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But there is definitely a problem when an employer expects their new hire to look a certain way or assumes that everyone working in support is female. \u201cNo, I definitely wouldn\u2019t consider a male PA\u201d \u2013 that comment is ubiquitous. </p> <p>One person told me that, in his household, the \u201csecretary and nanny are women \u2013 the chauffeur and butler are men\u201d because \u201cthat\u2019s how it\u2019s always been\u201d.

To be honest, I used to get irritated by women who bemoaned the difficulties of being female in the workplace. \u201cWhy can\u2019t people just get on with it?\u201d; \u201cWhy not work to create change, rather than moaning about it?\u201d, I often thought.</p> <p>I spent much of my early career brushing off everyday sexism and took it for granted. I prided myself on smiling in the face of sexist remarks. I taught myself to meet misogyny with pity and distain rather than anger.<br></p> <p>However, 2015 was the year I finally got cross about it all. In fact, I became searingly angry. I moved from being a secretary to recruiting secretaries for other people, and it was then that I couldn\u2019t ignore the realities of our industry. </p> <p>It\u2019s all well and good to decide not to make a fuss about things that upset you. But it\u2019s another thing entirely to be responsible for the safety and wellbeing of others, and to then consciously brush those concerns under the carpet. It nagged at my conscience, and I was compelled to do something about it. </p> <p>So what do we do if a client asks for \u201ca blonde\u201d? By far the strongest tool at our disposal is the power of \u201cwhy?\u201d We ask \u201cwhy?\u201d and it works every time, without fail. The problem with responding to casual misogyny with anger is that it\u2019s become the expected reaction. Anger is easily batted away with a host of practised responses, such as \u201cit\u2019s political correctness gone mad\u201d or \u201crelax \u2013 you\u2019re really uptight\u201d.</p> <p>Asking \u201cwhy?\u201d in a genuinely puzzled way has the most extraordinary effect \u2013 try it.

It\u2019s nowhere near as bad now, but it still happens.

How do I make sure that we can keep our candidates safe? Alongside obvious measures (identity verification, credit checking), we meet every single client in person, and go to view their office. I have two younger sisters \u2013 so, in my mind, I would \u201csister check\u201d every client I met. Would I feel comfortable sending one of my sisters to work for this person? If my internal radar said no, I wouldn\u2019t send the candidate.<br></p> <p>I founded my company in response to a clear need for a recruiter that genuinely understands the urgent need for a shift in attitude towards support workers.

He will be replaced by a nominee of the party\u2019s choice.</strong></li> <li><strong>Former Tasmanian Liberal MP Eric Hutchinson has got a parliamentary job with Senate president Stephen Parry using a special allocation from the PM\u2019s office for his presidential role. Luckily for the Liberal party, it will require lots of representation of the \u201cpresident\u201d in Tasmania, where the party lost three seats.</strong></li> <li><strong>Tony Abbott has tried to tempt Nick Xenophon into changing 18c of the Racial Discrimination Act. Xenophon says nope, nope, nope.</strong></li> <li><strong>Labor is meeting at a hastily called caucus meeting to calm factional tensions as a result of Shorten\u2019s captain call of Kimberley Kitching to replace Stephen Conroy.</strong></li> <li><strong>Malcolm Turnbull has suggested Labor\u2019s Mark Dreyfus was endangering national security by asking questions about a citizenship bill \u2013 telling him to get on \u201cTeam Australia\u201d.</strong></li> <li><strong>Attorney general George Brandis has been verbally jousting with Penny Wong all day in Senate estimates. We learned the ministerial standards statements on lobbying mean not very much. We learned that the luggage lift in the Lodge, approved under the Abbott regime, cost $83,500. We learned the Coalition agreement between Turnbull and Barnaby Joyce has not been sighted by anyone in the Prime Minister and Cabinet Department.<br></strong></li> <li><strong>Tomorrow, estimates will focus on George Brandis\u2019s department. Also tomorrow the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority will give evidence \u2013 the body that the deputy prime minister has unilaterally decided would move to his electorate. NBN Co is on tomorrow afternoon.</strong><br></li> </ul> <p>Thanks to <strong>Paul Karp, Gareth Hutchens </strong>and<strong> Katharine Murphy</strong> for their contributions.

As we speak the Labor left is having a specially convened caucus meeting to deal with tensions that have boiled over since <strong>Bill Shorten</strong> last Friday night backed his friend and factional ally, the controversial lawyer <strong>Kimberley Kitching</strong>, to replace the departing <strong>Stephen Conroy</strong>.<br></p> <p>Let\u2019s keep this as simple as possible. Tensions in the Victorian left have been bubbling away for months, ever since the majority of the faction tried to run the veteran leftwing powerbroker, <strong>Kim Carr</strong>, off the front bench. Folks aligned with Carr have been cranky that some of their Victorian colleagues lined up with colleagues in Sydney to try and remove Carr from the frontbench after the election.</p> <p>Let\u2019s call that a pre-existing condition.</p> <p>Then there was the Kitching transaction last week. Victorian Labor has been absolutely off the long run since Shorten decided he wanted Kitching in the Senate. Normally sedate people were quite literally tearing their hair out over that turn of events. Shorten was advised in the strongest possible terms not to bring Kitching to Canberra, that it would stir up animosities in the Labor caucus.</p> <p>It appears to have done exactly that. <strong>Gavin Marshall</strong> (a long time Carr ally) decided to tell Fairfax Media early on Monday that he might come after a couple of sitting MPs in the left when preselection time rolled around. He named <strong>Andrew Giles</strong> and <strong>Catherine King</strong>, the shadow health minister. </p> <p>Folks should know by way of background that Marshall lost a position he held in the last parliament, deputy Senate president, in the fight over Carr and the front bench. Clearly he\u2019s not that happy about it, and thought he might have a vent about people he views as being disloyal.</p> <p>The non-Carr left is now unhappy to put it mildly, hence tonight\u2019s special caucus meeting to determine whether peace can be declared, or whether things escalate.<br></p> <p>We can cut to the chase here, now all the background has been declared.<strong> Bill Shorten is the leader of the Labor party because he was underpinned institutionally by support from Conroy (now departed) and Carr (now the subject of acrimony from his factional fellow travellers).</strong><br></p> <p>That underpinning has been eroded since Conroy\u2019s departure. The caucus is something of a tinderbox after the Kitching decision. That might sound like an exaggeration, but it isn\u2019t. <strong>Malcolm Turnbull</strong> once talked about exciting times. Seems, they are catching.<br></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-10-17T07:06:52.933Z\">at 8.06am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-58046ba7e4b01ffb8ffcc70b\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-17T06:12:49.816Z\">7.12am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Xenophon to Abbott on 18c: no, no and no</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Nick Xenophon</strong> has responded to <strong>Tony Abbott</strong>\u2019s suggestion that changes to section 18C would \u201creadily\u201d pass if the Nick Xenophon Team supported them.<br></p> <p>Asked if his party was considering supporting a change, Xenophon told Guardian Australia: \u201cthe answer is no, no and no.

  "<p><strong>Hometown: </strong>Los Angeles. </p> <p><strong>The lineup: </strong>Kadhja Bonet (vocals, instruments). </p> <p><strong>The background:</strong> If you feel like you can\u2019t move for Amy Winehouse surrogates, try Kadhja Bonet, a new singer and musician from Los Angeles. Hers is phantasmagoric R&amp;B, soul from another time, another place. Another dimension, even. Bonet just knows the responses to her music will be rapturous evocations of the celestial and sublime, that questions will be raised about her provenance, such is its unearthly beauty. \u201c[Kadha] was born in 1784 in the backseat of a sea-foam green space pinto,\u201d she jokes on her Bandcamp page. \u201cAfter spending an extraordinarily long time in her mother\u2019s plasma, she discovered the joys and gratifications of making noise with her hands and face while traveling at maximum velocity through intergalactic jungle quadrants.\u201d </p> <p>\u201c1784\u201d? There is, indeed, something disconcerting about Bonet\u2019s music, an almost magic-realist prettiness: it\u2019s not so much timeless \u2013 extolling the eternal verities of classic soul songwriting, which is after all what the sub-Winehouses busy themselves with \u2013 as out of time. But which time? Sometimes it\u2019s like listening to music from the pre-rock era \u2013 from the 1940s, say \u2013 drenched as it is in Disney-sweet Hollywood strings. At others it seems as though it\u2019s beamed in from the 2040s, from a science fictional future when soul has become completely deracinated and etherised. She\u2019s a distant relative of Kelela and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/mar/08/sza\">SZA</a>, a defiantly non-electronic relative of those avant-R&amp;B explorers. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"New band of the week: Kadhja Bonet (No 124)\">  <iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/266823339%3Fsecret_token%3Ds-8WAgX&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;visual=true\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>The title of her new EP, The Visitor, has intimations of an alien traveller, and Bonet does agree that it\u2019s a concept work of sorts. \u201cIt\u2019s supposed to be a bite out of my journey and evolution,\u201d she explains. \u201cIt\u2019s mostly about the events that make you have to redefine yourself and confront yourself and be better at who you\u2019re meant to be. If it was a movie, it would be a coming-of-age film about someone trying to separate themselves form the false reality they\u2019ve created.\u201d</p> <p>Unlike <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/janelle-monae\">Janelle Monae</a>, there is actually no overarching conceptual apparatus accompanying her music: not for Bonet any <a href=\"https://buttaflyytulsa.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/janellemonae_metropolis.jpg?w=600&amp;h=360\">robo-guise or advanced sci-fi imagery</a>. There she is <a href=\"http://www.laweekly.com/music/celestial-soul-singer-kadhja-bonets-voice-has-the-power-to-stop-time-7486141\">in a recent article in LA Weekly</a>, dressed like a regular human. Do interviewers turn up imagining her to be unreal/incorporeal? Does Bonet get some of what Bj\u00f6rk used to get, that expectation of a creature verging on a sprite? </p> <p>\u201cYeah, maybe some people do,\u201d she laughs. \u201cI\u2019m definitely as elusive as a sprite, but not nearly as magical. I\u2019m embarrassed by what humans do sometimes \u2013 I wouldn\u2019t mind being \u2018not human\u2019. I don\u2019t want to let people down with how human I am.\u201d</p> <p>Nevertheless, the flesh-and-blood Bonet does have something of a rarefied backstory. She was raised in the East Bay area of San Francisco as one of six highly musical siblings, classically schooled in violin and viola, with her opera singer father and cellist mother, who envisioned for their daughter a career as a concert violinist. She grew up steeped in classical music, with a predilection for Shostakovich, Debussy and Ravel, and was discouraged from listening to non-classical music. Her production and ornate classical-tinged orchestral arrangements can be heard on the eight Visitor tracks, as can her playing of the violin, viola, flute and guitar (drums, harp, synth and bass are handled by friends). All the writing is hers, except for the Jaco Pastorius melody put to her words on Portrait of Tracy and a cover of Milton Nascimento\u2019s Francisco. First track Honeycomb sets the otherworldly tone, woozily luscious music that creates its own context. The title track opens with a descending string motif reminiscent of the intro to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juTeHsKPWhY\">James Brown\u2019s This Is a Man\u2019s Man\u2019s Man\u2019s World</a>, but there the connection to 60s R&amp;B ends. Bonet almost scat-sings and swoops between octaves with elan over this chamber soul-pop, like a cross between Cleo Lane and Liz Fraser of Cocteau Twins. There are hints here of classical, jazz, folk, of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1tZtL6oz44\">Minnie Riperton\u2019s adventures in paradisal soul with Rotary Connection.</a> Some reviewers have mentioned Solange, others Julia Holter and Jenny Hval. Not that Bonet would know \u2013 she doesn\u2019t read her press. She feels vulnerable giving interviews and uncomfortable reading the results. </p> <p>\u201cIt makes me squirm,\u201d she says, although she concedes, \u201cI understand people\u2019s curiosity.\u201d</p> <p>Reproducing the studio intricacy live has proven a challenge, so she tends to strip things back. But the reactions are still ones of surprise.</p> <p>\u201cPeople usually expect something different from me, for whatever reason,\u201d she notes. \u201cMaybe they expect more R&amp;B-soul stuff, that\u2019s more in the box \u2026 They expect me to sing \u2018black\u2019. I don\u2019t sing explicitly \u2018black\u2019 \u2013 that makes them a bit shocked and confused. But it\u2019s not my goal to sound like anyone else.\u201d </p> <p>Still, she enjoyed the response of fellow Californian Anderson Paak, whose Malibu is, like The Visitor, an album of the year. \u201cThis,\u201d he declared on Twitter, \u201cis the real shit.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI had to work hard at sounding like myself,\u201d she says finally, musing on how she arrived at her unique sound and deciding it was a struggle. \u201cIt\u2019s easiest to assume a character if you\u2019re vulnerable \u2013 it feels safer to imitate. But after hearing myself sing, I began to recognise, \u2018That\u2019s not me, that inflection isn\u2019t me.\u2019 After picking myself apart, I really sing like myself now. I don\u2019t have to think about it anymore.\u201d</p> <p><strong>The buzz: </strong>\u201cThink Joanna Newsome meets Janelle Monae\u201d \u2013 IndieCurrent.</p> <p><strong>The truth: </strong>It\u2019s soul music of the spheres. </p> <p><strong>Most likely to:</strong> Enchant. </p> <p><strong>Least likely to:</strong> Enrage. </p> <p><strong>What to buy: </strong>Debut mini-album The Visitor is released on 4 November via Fat Possum/Fresh Selects.</p> <p><strong>File next to:</strong> Minnie Riperton, Solange, Julia Holter, Ala.Ni. </p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/kadhja-bonet\">Links</a>: </strong>Soundcloud.com/kadhja-bonet</p> <p><strong>Ones to watch:</strong> Rejjie Snow, Alexandra Savior, Bossy Love, Leisure, Birthh. </p>",
  "<p>There are several qualities you need to have in your doctor\u2019s bag to survive as a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/gps\" title=\"\">GP</a>. Professionalism is of the utmost importance. As is keeping your cool even when you are being shouted at by someone who is intoxicated or under the influence, as happens every few weeks; or being threatened, or put in a position where the patient is trying to make you complicit in their fraud. The doctor\u2019s surgery is similar to the confessional. Only if it leads to a safeguarding issue can you break the confidential code.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/healthcare-network/views-from-the-nhs-frontline/2016/sep/05/better-doctor-accepting-mental-health-problem-gp\">I'm a better doctor for accepting that I have a mental health problem</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Resilience is invaluable. No matter what happened in that last appointment, it cannot affect those still to come. Empathy is vital. People come to see you terrified: that their headache is a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jan/12/my-brain-tumour-acoustic-neuroma\" title=\"\">brain tumour</a>; that they are going to lose a loved one; that you are going to judge them.</p> <p>These aside, the quality that you really need is a sense of humour. Without it, the job would be simply impossible. And frankly it\u2019s difficult to keep a straight face when you ask a patient for a urine sample, hand them the small white-topped tube and they start undoing their trousers in front of you, until you politely point out that there is a loo around the corner.</p> <p>On a typical day, 30 appointments are offered to my patients and I am fully booked for the day by the end of morning surgery \u2013 and that\u2019s without any urgent walk-ins that are spontaneously thrown into the mix. That means at least 30 10-minute sessions; 10 minutes to welcome, introduce, glean, triage, diagnose, reassure, comfort, investigate, refer, treat, prescribe and follow up.</p> <p>No two 10-minute slots are the same. You never know what will be coming up in the next appointment. Is it a quick case of tonsillitis in someone who\u2019s not too poorly? Or is it someone who takes 10 minutes of going on about their bunions and general gripes before revealing that they had an episode of crippling chest pain last night, by the way?</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>A patient goes on about their 'terrible tittyness' (tinnitus) while I try not to smile</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Is it a new psychiatric patient? I\u2019ll never forget the consultation in which a patient asked me how many doctors it took to tile a bathroom \u2013 apparently it depends how thinly you slice them (this is the sort of moment when you quickly check access to the door).</p> <p>Is it someone who will test my professionalism by going on about their \u201cterrible tittyness\u201d (tinnitus) while I try not to smile? Or someone who tells you their symptoms and by the end of the consultation you are 95% sure that they have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/cancer\" title=\"\">cancer</a>? Or a grieving widow who discloses that she and her late husband never consummated their marriage and that she is, in fact, an 80-year-old virgin?</p> <p>Then there are the phone calls. An average day probably involves 10 or so calls to patients who are invariably not at the phone when you find the time to ring them. So ensues a telephone ping-pong match until you\u2019re both in the right place at the right time. Meanwhile there\u2019s all the paperwork to get through, including reports and results. There are so many of the latter that I am constantly terrified of actioning an abnormal result as normal. Over-investigating is on the rise in this age of increased litigation.</p> <p>Working in an elderly-dense population, home visits are required daily and can range from two (quiet) to eight (hideous).These can be a real eye-opener: from palatial splendour to sticky and stained carpets. In between dashing here and there, I will try to catch a colleague to mull over a blood result I\u2019ve kept on the back burner, not knowing quite what to do with it.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/social-care-network/2016/aug/01/gps-gateway-social-care-support-services\">GPs should be a gateway to social care and support services</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The best thing by far about the job is the patients. The privilege you feel to have them trust in you and respect your decision-making (albeit not 100% of the time) is immense and hugely rewarding. Being able to fix their problems and make them feel better, control their pain and provide some comfort is extremely gratifying. As is being allowed into people\u2019s homes to relieve suffering in a dying patient. And making sure that when the time comes, they can die where they want, before supporting and guiding the whole family through this painful but inevitable time. At moments like these it is the best job in the world.</p> <p>And the worst things about it? The passive privatisation of general practice. The daily doctor-bashing in the press. The promises from government that you will be able to see your family doctor from 8am until 8pm, seven days a week. As you can see from the plight and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/02/junior-doctors-striking-payroll-seven-day\" title=\"\">strikes of the junior doctors</a>, we do not have government support right now. Instead, we are vilified and made out to be money-grubbing if we complain about our working conditions. We have all gone through years of training as junior doctors to become GPs in the first place and urgently need the next generation to stay in the health service. It is getting increasingly difficult to recruit and our roles are continually changing, which is deeply sad because it is without a doubt a vocation: you simply wouldn\u2019t do it otherwise.</p> <p>It is hard missing out on your own family milestones \u2013 first days at school or the nativity play \u2013 because surgery can start at 7am and go on until 7.30pm, when your children are already in bed, where they were when you left for work that morning. Ironically, being a family doctor means you are there for everyone else\u2019s before your own. You know all of your patients\u2019 family members by name, often their extended family too. You are there at their sides to help them through some of the most momentous events in their lives, whether that is bringing new life in to the world or easing the pain as another life leaves it.</p> <p>It is an honour and a privilege to be a GP.

  "<p>Robert Langer seems incredibly well adjusted for a man with transatlantic jetlag. And, for that matter, for someone who struggled for years to get his pioneering work in drug delivery accepted by the scientific establishment. As a young professor, his first nine research grant applications were turned down. Once, at a formal dinner in the early 80s, a senior colleague blew smoke in his eyes and told him to find another job.</p> <p>And yet here he is, a good-natured nanotechnology trailblazer, swooping into the UK for duties associated with having won the \u00a31m <a href=\"http://qeprize.org/\">Queen Elizabeth prize for engineering</a>. His work has improved the lives of 2 billion people and counting. He has collected awards from two US presidents, as well as the Queen. He has more than 1,000 patents on the go, and 30 companies have spun out from his vast lab at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (the largest biomedical lab in the world). At 68, he is still the future.</p> <p>It\u2019s hard not to see Langer as a medical Willy Wonka, with armies of students and post docs, beavering away on the huge range of his research interests. There\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/architecture-design-blog/2014/jul/11/design-futures-remote-controlled-contraceptive-microchip-launch-by-2018\">contraceptive microchip implants</a>; a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2009/oct/22/julie-andrews-synthetic-vocal-cords\">gel to repair damaged vocal cords</a>; <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-LusnuRcLw\">spinal cord repair tissue;</a> an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/may/09/stretchy-second-skin-could-make-wrinkles-a-thing-of-the-past\">invisible \u201csecond skin\u201d</a> for conditions such as eczema (with the cosmetic side effect of rendering skin smooth and elastic); <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/s/543826/the-science-of-a-perfect-hair-day/\">cutting-edge anti-frizz haircare</a>; and what Langer calls \u201c<a href=\"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/04/160406124633.htm\">super-long-acting capsules or pills</a>, that would last a week, a month, or even a year\u201d. If anyone could figure out how to make everlasting gobstoppers, it would be Langer.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9cd6f0838ee16e185182d2d13f7b4a9d243510f1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9cd6f0838ee16e185182d2d13f7b4a9d243510f1/0_6_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Robert Langer\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Robert Langer: the winner of the \u00a31m Queen Elizabeth award for engineering.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Bebber for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Commonly, when pharmaceuticals enter the body, they are coated in synthetic substances called polymers. These allow effective amounts of the drug to reach the body, slowly enough so as not to cause toxicity. Until Langer came along, this controlled method only worked for simpler, small-molecule drugs. Sophisticated large-molecule drugs, that can target diseases such as cancer, diabetes and mental illness, were too big to pass through polymers. \u201cPeople wouldn\u2019t think you could walk through a wall either,\u201d he says. \u201cBut we built all these tortuous channels in what was the equivalent of the wall so somebody could get through, but they get through very slowly, like driving through London in rush hour.\u201d</p> <p>Langer also designed biologically tolerable polymer pellets \u2013 nanopellets, he calls them \u2013 that enable drugs to be implanted directly into cancer tumours. This enabled Langer and the cancer researcher <a href=\"http://www.pnas.org/content/105/36/13203.full\">Judah Folkman</a> to isolate the first vascular inhibitors, which stop new blood vessels feeding tumours. \u201cWe thought it could be a new way of treating cancer,\u201d Langer says, \u201cand it\u2019s become that. Drugs such as <a href=\"http://www.macmillan.org.uk/cancerinformation/cancertreatment/treatmenttypes/biologicaltherapies/monoclonalantibodies/bevacizumab.aspx\">Avastin</a> [bevacizumab] and <a href=\"https://www.drugs.com/eylea.html\">Eylea</a> [aflibercept] are based, in part, on our early research.\u201d He also created new polymers that could dissolve like a bar of soap and release drugs in a very controlled way over months to years. And he and neurosurgeon Henry Brem developed implants (called gliadel wafers) that could be <a href=\"http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancers-in-general/cancer-questions/chemotherapy-wafer-implants\">implanted in the brain to treat brain cancer</a>. Trials in 1996 saw a 63% survival rate against just 19% in the control group.</p> <p>More than 20 million patients around the world have been treated with vascular-inhibiting substances and other medicines derived from Langer\u2019s engineered polymers. He also invented drug-coated cardiovascular stents, which have benefited more than a million. There are, however, plenty more medical conundrums to be solved. \u201cWe\u2019re doing a lot with the Gates Foundation,\u201d he says. The chief aim of the super-long-acting pill is to tackle low patient compliance rates in the developing world, in treatments for malaria and TB. \u201cYou have a much greater chance of solving the problem or eradicating the disease if you could do that,\u201d he says. But there would clear benefits, too, for conditions such as Alzheimer\u2019s or schizophrenia.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"cf62d8dd5376ef2bbf35e05571ae46bd60e1c646\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cf62d8dd5376ef2bbf35e05571ae46bd60e1c646/99_0_1439_1439/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Langer\u2019s capsules dissolve to unfurl super-elastic stars\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Stars in the making: Langer\u2019s capsules dissolve to unfurl super-elastic stars in the stomach.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Vimeo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Langer picks up a pencil and draws a star with stick arms, like a snowflake, and describes his solution in beautifully simple terms. To avoid excretion, the pill must be too big to pass from the stomach into the gastrointestinal tract, but small enough so that it doesn\u2019t cause a blockage. \u201cLet\u2019s say you had a capsule, made out of something that dissolves in acid in your stomach. And then you make a material that\u2019s super elastic, or has shape memory.\u201d The super-elastic star is squished into the capsule, and unfurls in the stomach after the capsule dissolves. Finally, he says, \u201cyou want to tune the degradability, so that it can last whatever amount of time you want. That\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to do.\u201d</p> <p>The microchip birth control is another Gates Foundation project. \u201cIt could also be useful for osteoporosis,\u201d he says, where there\u2019s a high drop-out rate among women needing frequent injections of the parathyroid hormone. \u201cWe might be able to give them a little implant and just deliver the drug every night.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnother question the Gates Foundation has asked us is: can we come up with ways to make it easier for people to get iron and zinc and vitamins?\u201d The solution: the healthiest seasoning ever. \u201cWe\u2019re coming up with a salt you can boil for up to two hours and nothing happens, but then, when you eat it, within an hour, 11 different nutrients come out. They are in polymers that are edible.\u201d</p> <p>Also on the boil, he says, \u201care better vaccines for polio and other things.\u201d These usually require booster shots, but many people don\u2019t come back for the second injection. \u201cSo we\u2019re designing some systems where you can give a single injection of nanospheres, and they\u2019ll just pop at different times. One might deliver the drug at time zero, another at six months, another at a year.\u201d This would have the added benefit of fewer injections, so less risk of infection, and save time and money by only requiring one medical appointment. \u201cWe\u2019re calling it pulsatile,\u201d he says, always with an eye on broader uses. \u201cWhy not apply that to other diseases, such as HIV?\u201d</p> <p>Because of the wide use of treatments based on his work, Langer has met many of the people whose lives he has affected. \u201cI almost feel bad,\u201d he says. \u201cYou want people to have healthy lives, so it\u2019s better if they haven\u2019t benefited from [the treatments]. But, yeah, it\u2019s a lot of people.\u201d Too many people to feel emotional about? \u201cWell, you always do, though. If somebody has benefited and feels grateful, I think you feel glad, but I always hope they don\u2019t need what we do \u2013 other than the hair and skin products, perhaps.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>The government is to release new ratings for maternity wards across England to allow prospective parents to compare and contrast services in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/nhs\">NHS</a> hospitals, as part of a drive to reduce instances of stillbirth and brain injuries during labour.</p> <p>Maternity data detailing the frequency of accidents within clinical commissioning groups and the health prospects of expectant mothers \u2013 including the percentage of smokers, for example \u2013 will be collated to form England-wide ratings. </p> <p>In a major speech on Monday, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/jeremy-hunt\">Jeremy Hunt</a> will also unveil proposals to allow the NHS to offer compensation automatically to parents of babies left stillborn or brain-damaged because of poor care. The health secretary wants parents of children starved of oxygen at birth no longer to endure a wait of about 11 years for compensation.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ac5fd734630bc5a46542f151d3d3af016e3cd98a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ac5fd734630bc5a46542f151d3d3af016e3cd98a/0_71_3225_1935/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jeremy Hunt arrives for the fourth day of the Conservative Party Conference 2016\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Stillbirth rates are still among the highest in western Europe, according to Jeremy Hunt.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Carl Court/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At present parents often become embroiled in lengthy and costly legal action against the NHS, forcing grieving families to fight for months or even years before the health service agrees to compensation. </p> <p>Bereaved parents often have to instruct solicitors to determine the cause of their child\u2019s death, with health bosses sometimes denying any liability until they are ordered to pay compensation by a judge. </p> <p>Under the new scheme, which was first recommended by Tory peer Baroness Cumberlege earlier this year, an independent rapid resolution and redress scheme will be set up to investigate tragedies in childbirth, which would quickly decide whether compensation should be paid.</p> <p>The launch comes as figures showed that the cost of settling claims with parents whose children are damaged at birth has reached more than \u00a30.5bn. The NHS as a whole pays out more than \u00a31bn a year in negligence compensation, and reducing that cost is seen a key way of mitigating the financial crisis facing the service.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/oct/15/bma-theresa-may-nhs-crisis-autumn-statement\">BMA: Theresa May lacks understanding about seriousness of NHS crisis</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In February this year, Cumberlege recommended the investigations into maternity cases and any subsequent payouts are made by the trusts without any court involvement. The recommendation was one of several made by Cumberlege, who has been chairing an independent review of maternity services in England.</p> <p>The new proposals are modelled on a Swedish scheme, which has reduced serious avoidable birth injuries by about 50% in the past six to seven years. </p> <p>Health secretary Jeremy Hunt said he hoped to end the culture where going to court was an automatic \u201cfirst step\u201d and instead foster a culture of transparency so the NHS can learn from its mistakes.</p> <p>Under the plans, claims by parents who believe medical errors have caused severe damage to their children \u2013 such as cerebral palsy or brain damage \u2013 would be assessed by investigators working independently of the NHS trust.

It would work out far cheaper for the NHS than the current route, in which cases go to court or are settled out of court, often for millions of pounds. </p> <p>Data from the NHS Litigation Authority shows the compensation bill to the NHS for errors around the time of birth is rising, reaching \u00a3509.3m in 2015/16 \u2013 up from \u00a3393.2m in 2014/15.</p> <p>A spokeswoman for the Department of Health said the plan, which will be the subject of a consultation, would not \u201clock\u201d parents into the scheme and would let them bring their own legal case against the trust if they were unhappy with the outcome. </p> <p>The new maternity ward ratings follow Hunt\u2019s recent creation of similar schemes to help patients and families compare the quality of cancer and dementia care. However, once they start being published, they will set out details for services within each of the NHS\u2019s 209 GP-led clinical commissioning groups rather than the 156 acute hospital trusts with maternity services. Hunt said that openness about the quality of care will help empower patients and reduce wide variation in care quality.</p> <p>In a speech at the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, Hunt will also set out \u00a38m for training, with at least \u00a340,000 available to each NHS trust in England. </p> <p>A \u00a3250,000 maternity safety innovation fund will pilot new ideas for improving care, while maternity ratings for every part of England \u2013 using data that already exists \u2013 will be published together to encourage greater transparency. </p> <p>Other measures being unveiled include a new Healthcare Safety Investigation Branch, modelled on the Air Accidents Investigation Branch. A new tool will also standardise the investigation of every stillbirth and early baby death so lessons can be learned.</p> <p>Hunt said: \u201cOur NHS maternity staff do a fantastic job under huge pressure. But even though we have made much progress, our stillbirth rates are still among the highest in western Europe and many on the frontline say there is still too much of a blame culture when things go wrong \u2013 often caused by fear of litigation or worry about damage to reputation and careers.</p> <p>\u201cThese comprehensive measures will give practical support to help trusts improve their approach to safety \u2013 and help to foster an open and transparent culture so that the courts become a last resort not an automatic first step.\u201d</p> <p>In May this year a new report revealed figures that 15 babies are dying every day in the UK from stillbirth, during labour or within four weeks of being born. </p> <p>The report was published by <a href=\"http://www2.le.ac.uk/departments/health-sciences/research/timms/projects/mbrrace-uk\">MBRRACE-UK</a> (Mothers and Babies: Reducing Risk through Audits and Confidential Enquiries in the UK), which is a collaboration of academics and medical experts. </p> <p>It found that there were big variations in death rates across the country, from 4.1 to 7.1 per 1,000 births. Women from the poorest backgrounds and black and Asian mothers run a higher risk that their baby will die in the womb or soon after birth.</p> <p>In nearly half of all stillbirths (46%), the causes of death are unknown, said the report. The biggest causes of death in the early weeks of life are complications following birth (32%) and congenital anomalies such as heart defects (28%), and very premature birth (13%).</p> <p>The MBRRACE team flagged up the need for research into premature births and also called for every maternity unit to review and record the causes of death in the same way to try to discover why there are such stark variations around the country.</p> <p>James Taylor, head of policy and public affairs at disability charity Scope, said of the new plans: \u201cFinding out that your child has been affected by a birth injury can be a very traumatic time for parents. </p> <p>\u201cSo it is very positive that the government will be listening to disabled people and their parents on how the NHS can better support families when serious issues do occur during birth.\u201d</p> <p> </p>",

Wow, that\u2019s a long time ago, but that beautiful feeling of stillness and nostalgia in that setting and that folk tune has stayed with me.<br></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1emWUX8mJqY\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/1emWUX8mJqY?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p><strong>If you had time to learn a new instrument, what would it be?</strong></p> <p>The harp.

  "<p>Drive south along Croatia\u2019s Adriatic freeways and you will stumble on the kind of border headache that Ireland might face when Britain leaves the EU.<br></p> <p>An hour-long tailback at the border with Bosnia and Herzegovina makes motorists fume. A desultory passport check and everyone is on their way again \u2013 but not for long. Ten miles further south there\u2019s another border, this time crossing from Bosnia back into Croatia.</p> <p>When Croatia joined the EU in 2013, these became hard borders again overnight. If Britain opts for a \u201c\u2018hard Brexit\u201d, ending freedom of movement with the EU and requiring new trade arrangements, the same issues could rear up along the 310-mile (500km) frontier between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic.</p> <p>Officials on both sides seem determined that no hard border will re-emerge. Many feel that passport checks in particular would be unnecessary, however urgently the British feel they need to \u201ctake back control\u201d of their borders. </p> <p>But questions remain: how will customs enforce differences in tariffs without searching lorries on the scores of roads that run between north and south? If the border is not policed, how will EU nationals who migrate to the Irish Republic be prevented from moving to the north, and then to Great Britain? </p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/maps/embed/oct/2016-10-03T15:06:26.html\" data-alt=\"Croatia map\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/maps/embed/oct/2016-10-03T15:06:26.html\">Croatia map</a> </figure>  <p>Like the Irish divide, the 850-mile demarcation line in the Balkans cuts across cultural, family, and business ties, with bilateral trade worth \u00a31.1bn (\u20ac1.3bn).</p> <p>When Croatia joined the EU on 1 July 2013, the bloc\u2019s external frontier was redrawn along the country\u2019s borders with Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Montenegro. The border with Bosnia and Herzegovina has proved particularly troublesome. Both were once republics of Yugoslavia, and 15% of Bosnian citizens are ethnic Croats, most of whom have Croatian EU passports. </p> <p>In some cases, the results are surreal: houses and farms that are part in the EU and part not, and farmers who need to show ID to get to and from their own fields.</p> <p>Ivan Glavota runs a winery with a 100-year-old wine cellar in Imotski, a picturesque small town on the Croatian side that is perched on cliffs above a striking azure lake. He has 1,000 vines on the Bosnian side of the border. In addition to the occasional bureaucratic hassle of crossing to his own land, he is not able to obtain EU or Croatian funding for the grapes harvested across the border, though the wine is made in Croatia.</p> <p>\u201cThis creates a problem for numerous small agriculture producers in the area,\u201d he says.</p> <p>The border has become synonymous with such frustrations. Even though most Bosnian goods enjoy free-trade status within the EU, Bosnian agricultural goods can only be exported to Croatia through two customs posts on their long frontier, pushing up costs. Tariff-free trade privileges were suspended temporarily earlier this year during a bureaucratic wrangle.</p> <p>\u201cPeople tend to sometimes forget that Croatia is now part of a different system, that things are not like they used to be,\u201d says Amer Kapetanovic, assistant minister for bilateral affairs and economic diplomacy at the Bosnian foreign ministry. \u201cAll these bureaucratic nuances suddenly became very important and this is the moment of realisation that Croatia is in the EU and we are not, despite the fact that we used to live together in one state, we speak the same language, listen to the same music, have the same jokes, have family either side of the border.\u201d</p> <p>Kapetanovic warns his counterparts to avoid a clean break when it comes to Brexit negotiations.</p> <p>\u201cIt would be wise if during the negotiations on article 50 both the UK and Ireland strongly opt for continuing with an open border policy,\u201d he says. \u201cAs neither are part of Schengen [passport-free travel zone], I think it would be the wisest approach. Otherwise some of our examples affecting our daily life with our EU neighbour Croatia might appear in your situation as well, and I\u2019m sure your people would not like it.\u201d</p> <p>Croatian former interior minister Ranko Ostojic, who was in office when Croatia joined the EU, points out that citizens living within 30km of the border are eligible for special passes. But he acknowledges that there are long queues at the border as all other non-EU citizens (including most Bosnians) are subject to \u201cfull passport control\u201d at the border, and require biometric passports.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"652e32e5f41df51fe1282b851ff9d465fc5242dd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/652e32e5f41df51fe1282b851ff9d465fc5242dd/0_0_4096_2732/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Trucks queue on the Serbian side of the border between Serbia and Croatia.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Trucks queue on the Serbian side of the border between Serbia and Croatia.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Zoltan Balogh/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>The Nordic model</h2> <p>About 2,000 miles to the north, another EU border provides further insights into what happens when two close trading partners have a hard tariff border. </p> <p>In the Swedish town of Charlottenberg, sweet shops are thriving because of the different prices of sugar in Sweden and Norway.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/maps/embed/sep/2016-09-30T15:49:54.html\" data-alt=\"Sweden map\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/maps/embed/sep/2016-09-30T15:49:54.html\">Sweden map</a> </figure>  <p>Every weekend, Norwegians come to fill their boots \u2013 literally \u2013 from an assortment of 4,000 varieties of cheap candy in stores such as <a href=\"http://www.gottebiten.se/\">Gottebiten</a>, which is almost the size of a football field.</p> <p>Enormous Swedish shopping centres within driving distance of Oslo also cater to Norwegian demand for low-tax tobacco and alcohol. </p> <p>The creation of the Nordic Council after the second world war saw passport-free travel and a common labour market implemented across the Nordic countries. Sweden\u2019s accession to the EU in 1995 did not change the arrangement, and indeed Norway\u2019s membership of the European Economic Area makes issues such as freedom of movement moot.</p> <p>The two countries that once split apart have grown closer together, despite one being inside the EU and the other outside. So could Norway and Sweden hold any lessons for the future of Britain and Ireland?<br></p> <p>\u201cPassport-free movement while Norway is not an EU member is quite unique,\u201d says Peter Dafteryd, a councillor for the ruling centre-right group on the town council of Str\u00f6mstad, another community near the border with Norway. \u201cThe problem in Ireland is that that kind of arrangement has not been prepared. It will be a struggle for both sides, I think.\u201d</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/regional_policy/en/atlas/programmes/2014-2020/europe/2014tc16rfcb016\">EU\u2019s Interreg programme</a> spends as much as \u20ac20m a year on strengthening economic cooperation across the border. \u201cThe EU wants to have good relations with its neighbours,\u201d says Michael von Essen, a project officer for Interreg on the Swedish side.</p> <p>Some Norwegian companies like to establish themselves inside the EU, so they open small offices in places such as Str\u00f6mstad, just 80 miles from Oslo, according to Dafterydl.</p> <p>\u201cThat way they have a daughter company in the EU, with quite different taxes and regulations. It\u2019s a way of getting into the EU without being a member,\u201d Dafteryd says. Norwegians bring more than 8bn krona (\u00a3715m) into the Str\u00f6mstad area every year, paying the salaries of some 2,000 Swedes, he adds.</p> <h2>Germany-Switzerland</h2> <p>Another model for the future of the British-Irish border may be glimpsed where Germany meets Switzerland.<br></p> <p> Officially, there have been no land border controls between the two countries since 12 December 2008, and journeys by air have been denoted \u201cinland flights\u201d since 29 March 2009 \u2013 which means people only need to show their ID card to board a flight from Berlin to Zurich, and can walk from Basel to Weil am Rhein without any documents.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/maps/embed/oct/2016-10-03T15:11:12.html\" data-alt=\"Switzerland map\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/maps/embed/oct/2016-10-03T15:11:12.html\">Switzerland map</a> </figure>  <p> Apart from the odd cow fence, there are no fortifications along the 362-km border. About 54,000 people who live in Germany commute daily to Switzerland.</p> <p> But since Switzerland is not part of the EU\u2019s customs union, both countries carry out some checks at the crossings. For example, even though Switzerland is part of Schengen, Germans on holiday to the Swiss Alps are not allowed to take more than two bottles of wine or 500g of beef. Likewise, if expensive skiing equipment is purchased in Verbier, it must be declared to German customs when crossing back into the EU.</p> <p>The line between controlling traffic of people and goods is hard to draw. Swiss customs officials are also required to carry out ID checks for security issues, and not just at fixed border points but also via mobile units that operate along the border. Customs officials say they can carry out spot checks without creating tailbacks at border points.</p> <p>In September 2010 Bavarian police gained the first lead that eventually resulted in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/05/german-and-swiss-art-galleries-display-cornelius-gurlitt-nazi-art\">discovery of the Munich art hoard</a> after customs officers discovered \u20ac9,000 in cash on collector Cornelius Gurlitt during a spot check on a Zurich-Munich train. The legal limit is \u20ac10,000.</p> <p>Since the start of 2015, even couriers who travel two miles to deliver pizzas from an Italian restaurant in Weil am Rhein to Basel have to declare their stone-oven-baked wares with Swiss customs. It\u2019s easy to see why: a pizza margherita, which sells for about \u20ac4.90 on the German side of the border, costs \u20ac13 in Basel. </p> <p>It is no coincidence the term \u201cshopping tourist\u201d was voted the Swiss word of the year in 2015. People in German border cities such as Konstanz complain about Swiss visitors gridlocking their medieval city.</p> <p>Shopping tourists are already emerging in northern Ireland, as the slump in sterling makes goods in Britain that much cheaper. <br></p> <p>But there have been no reports of gridlock in Belfast as yet.</p> <p><br></p> <p><br></p> <p> </p>",

  "<p>I think and write a lot about mental health. Since being diagnosed with anxiety and clinical perfectionism, writing has become an important way of coming to terms with my own psychiatric ailments, while trying also to raise public awareness. It\u2019s not an easy task. Despite my eagerness and many importunate attempts to give a voice to mental illness, I am often left feeling like the world isn\u2019t ready to listen. </p> <p>But when <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-10-10/mental-health-week-more-than-just-a-hashtag/7918386\">mental health week</a> ticked around this year, ears pricked up. My news feed was awash with articles about mental health, friends brandishing popular hashtags and events popping up all around my city. </p> <p>Finally, a week where mental health was a hot topic, where my issues were on the frontline. If ever there was a time when my humble opinions on the human brain might count for something, this was sure to be it. I panicked.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/small-business-network/2016/oct/10/mental-health-not-only-about-darkness-depression\">'Mental health is not only about darkness and depression'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Determined to seize the opportunity, I started bashing out stories and pitches with intensity, like I was trying to give my computer\u2019s motherboard some kind of frantic deep tissue massage. My mind turned cartwheels. Within 20 minutes I had chewed all my fingernails back to the quick and yanked out a few generous handfuls of hair \u2013 telltale symptoms of my escalating anxiety.</p> <p>I forgot to have lunch. I forgot to pick my little sister up from school. I missed two calls from my partner. But somehow I still managed to singlehandedly pluck all the tiny hairs on my leg, another delightful habit I tend to deploy with fervour whenever I need to curb my anxiety.</p> <p>As time ticked by and the pressure mounted, I realised I was heading for a nervous breakdown. Maybe I was making too big a deal of mental health week, but that is the very nature of my mental illness \u2013 the tendency to inflate and catastrophise. It was a bitter irony: my anxiety was the very thing that stopped me from writing about it. </p> <p>So I closed my laptop and resolved to stay silent for mental health week. I decided that protecting my own mental state was more important than writing about it. And I reassured myself there would be other opportunities.</p> <p>See, that\u2019s just it with mental illness. Often we cannot talk about it when the world wants us to \u2013 whether that be our families, therapists or the media. And when we are ready to speak up, we can\u2019t find the ears. </p> <p>Even with efforts to reduce stigma, mental health is an extremely sensitive topic. It takes a long time to develop the personal insight and vocabulary to be able to communicate about our mental states. In my experience, you can only really talk (or write) about it on your own terms and in your own time. This means we need a culture that is receptive to discussions the year round, not just at designated calendar points.</p> <p>While initiatives like mental health week are exceedingly important, they are not always as beneficial to sufferers in the ways they intend to be. The sudden spike in publicity may feel like a fleeting injection of sympathy that leaves us even more isolated once the week is over and our issues fall into the background once again. </p> <p>The ephemeral support for mental illness shines with a suspicious veneer, tarnished by the knowledge that talking about mental illness might earn you a hundred likes on Facebook on one day but compromise your job application the next. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/12/neoliberalism-creating-loneliness-wrenching-society-apart\">Neoliberalism is creating loneliness.

I think these initiatives are noble and necessary. I think they are crucial to creating a society that makes it easier to live with a mental illness. But if listening to people with mental illness and understanding their experiences is the most important step in dissolving the silence and stigma, we need to be open on a more general, everyday basis. </p> <p>We need a culture that is attuned to the nuances of mental illness and accepting of the silences as well as the disclosures.

It is not illegal to buy or sell the drugs, but it is to use them to bring about an abortion.</p> <p>In April, a woman in Northern Ireland who took the pills and was reported to the police by her two flatmates was given a three-month suspended sentence by Belfast crown court. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/08/northern-ireland-abortion-women-culture-suspicion-fear-prosecution-belfast\">The case sparked protests and demonstrations of solidarity from other women </a>who announced they too had resorted to the abortion pills and challenged police to arrest them.</p> <p>Women with an unwanted pregnancy in Ireland previously had to travel to the UK if they wanted to have an abortion. Between 1970 and 2015, 180,797 women from Ireland and 61,311 women from Northern Ireland made the journey. Many still do rather than break the law by bringing about an abortion at home.</p> <p>But the study, carried out by Abigail Aiken and her colleagues at the University of Texas at Austin, found that many of the women who went online for help could not afford to travel or to take time off work or the costs of childcare.</p> <p>\u201cThese barriers create a stark health inequity: women with financial and social resources can access offshore termination of pregnancy, while women who lack such resources cannot,\u201d says the paper.</p> <p>The study found that 5,650 women sought help from the site between 2010 and 2015. Most (85%) were between 20 and 30 years old and were mothers (63%).</p> <p>The most common reason for choosing to terminate pregnancy (reported by 62% of women) was not being able to cope with a child at that point in their lives. Nearly half \u2013 44% \u2013 cited having no money to provide for a child, and 23% felt their family was already complete. Nearly a third \u2013 30% \u2013 felt they were too young to have a child or wanted to finish their education. </p> <p>Almost all \u2013 97% \u2013 said they felt accessing and using the medication at home was the right thing for them and 98% said they would recommend it to other women in a similar situation. The most common feeling they reported after completing the procedure was relief (70%), followed by satisfaction (36%). Over a quarter \u2013 26.8% \u2013 said they were happy and 22% said they were pleased. The vast majority \u2013 94% \u2013 expressed gratitude that they could go online and obtain the pills.</p> <p>\u201cThere is a very negative perception of a home abortion,\u201d said Aiken, an Irish-born assistant professor at the US university. \u201cPeople regard it as desperate and a last resort. But women say it is very helpful for their health, wellbeing and autonomy. The only negative thing is that they have to do it outside of the law.\u201d</p> <p>The website asks women to make a donation to its costs, suggesting \u20ac70 to \u20ac90. Over a third \u2013 35% \u2013 said they found it difficult to find the money. Nearly a quarter (24%) said they did not get enough emotional support from family and friends.</p> <p>One of the women surveyed told the researchers: \u201cThere is no way I could have afforded to travel to England, pay for the procedure, stay in a hotel, and have someone there to support me. Thanks to this service, I was able to have a safe abortion in an environment where I felt comfortable and with my partner there to support me. Thank you for enabling women to have control over their own bodies.\u201d </p> <p>Others said that without access to home abortion, they would have considered suicide. \u201cI can\u2019t thank you enough \u2013 you have saved my life,\u201d said one. \u201cI would have had to resort to desperate measures.

  "<p>The husband of a woman caught up in a major Chinese police crackdown targeting Australia\u2019s Crown casino giant has rejected claims she was involved in any illegal activity and spoken of his fears that she may be jailed.</p> <p>Jeff Sikkema said he had not seen his wife, Jiang Ling, a Shanghai-based employee of Crown, since the early hours of last Friday when she was taken from the couple\u2019s home in Shanghai by police. </p> <p>Jiang was one of 18 employees of James Packer\u2019s Crown Resorts, including three senior Australian executives, who were detained in <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/oct/17/packers-crown-casino-company-unable-to-contact-18-employees-detained-in-china\">a coordinated series of police actions</a> across the country at around the same time.</p> <p>Those now under arrest are thought to include Jason O\u2019Connor, the head of Crown\u2019s VIP international team who was responsible for attracting Chinese \u201chigh-roller\u201d gamblers to the company\u2019s casinos. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/oct/17/packers-crown-casino-company-unable-to-contact-18-employees-detained-in-china\">Packer's Crown casino company unable to contact 18 employees detained in China</a> </p> </aside>  <p>China\u2019s foreign ministry has said the group is being held on suspicion of \u201cgambling crimes\u201d. </p> <p> Sikkema, 53, told the Guardian he had initially thought his wife was only being taken in for routine questioning and would be released quickly. </p> <p>But Sikkema, who is from Michigan, US, but has lived in Shanghai for about 15 years, said he now feared she might be facing a lengthy period behind bars after receiving a formal arrest notice on Sunday. <br></p> <p>\u201cThe conviction rate in China is 99.9%,\u201d he said.<br></p> <p>The formal notification of Jiang\u2019s arrest, seen by the Guardian, states that she is being held according to <a href=\"http://chinalawtranslate.com/criminal-procedure-law/?lang=en\">article 80 of China\u2019s criminal procedure law</a> on suspicion of \u201ccommitting gambling crimes\u201d.</p> <p>Article 80 stipulates that a person caught committing a crime or a major suspect may be taken into custody for a variety of reasons including if they are \u201cmaking preparations to commit a crime, committing a crime or immediately after committing a crime\u201d; if \u201cthere is a chance of them destroying or fabricating evidence or colluding statements with others\u201d; or if they are \u201cmajor criminal suspects that have committed crimes across regions, committed multiple crimes, or committed crimes as part of a gang\u201d. </p> <p>Sikkema rejected the suggestion his wife had committed a crime. <br></p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s done absolutely nothing illegal \u2026 She does admin stuff. She is the admin manager of the Shanghai area. So she processes visas. She gets information from potential Crown customers that want to go to Australia to gamble. She takes their information, she compiles it, she fills out the forms, get their passports, takes it down to the consulate, drops off all the information and then when it is ready, she comes picks it up and sends it out to the customer. This is the most boring job in the world.\u201d</p> <p>Sikkema said he believed Crown\u2019s entire China-based staff was now being held by police. \u201cThis isn\u2019t just my wife \u2013 it\u2019s everyone in China.\u201d</p> <p>Sikkema said he had already gone to bed last Thursday night when the crackdown began. At about midnight, a group of six police officers appeared outside the couple\u2019s home in Shanghai. </p> <p>\u201cI was woken up by a Chinese policeman standing in the doorway, while I very nicely told him to: \u2018Get the fuck out of my bedroom \u2013 I need to put my pants on.\u2019 To which he responded: \u2018Well, I\u2019m the police.\u2019 I said: \u2018I don\u2019t care who the fuck you are. I don\u2019t have any pants on.\u2019 So that was pleasant to start with.\u201d</p> <p>Sikkema said police then proceeded to question Jiang, who uses the English name Jenny, for about three hours about topics related to her work with Crown.</p> <p>\u201cThey were speaking Shanghainese \u2026 so I didn\u2019t get much of anything,\u201d he said.</p> <p>In the early hours of Friday morning the officers announced they would be taking Jiang to a police station for further interrogation. Despite this Sikkema said his wife did not seem overly concerned. </p> <p>\u201cI felt she really thought it was just going to be going to the station for a few more questions and she\u2019d be released probably before I got up in the morning,\u201d he said. </p> <p>\u201cShe insisted that I stay at home. I said, \u2018Should I contact your father? Should I contact a lawyer?\u2019 She was like, \u2018No, no, no, that\u2019s not needed. Don\u2019t worry about that.\u2019\u201d<br></p> <p>\u201cWhen I talked to the police and I said, \u2018Pardon me, how do I get hold of you? Can I get a name card or something? \u2026 Or know where you are taking her?\u2019 They were like, \u2018No, if we need to talk to you we will call you. Don\u2019t call us.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSadly, jokingly, at the time, I said, \u2018What if you are gone for a week?\u2019 And everyone present just sort of laughed, including my wife. It seems not as funny now as it was when I said it.\u201d </p> <p>He added: \u201cIt was just going to be a little thing. But obviously it is not now.\u201d</p> <p>Sikkema said he had been alarmed to discover through an intermediary with knowledge of the police investigation that his wife might have confessed to escorting Crown customers in China to the company\u2019s casinos in Australia.</p> <p>\u201cThat is the easiest confession in the world to debunk. Because she has never been to Australia, She doesn\u2019t have an Australian visa and her passport can prove that,\u201d he said. <br></p> <p>\u201cThe fact that they are saying they have a confession from her with her saying that worries me a lot \u2026 I don\u2019t know what they are doing that made her confess that \u2013 an obvious, blatant lie.\u201d </p> <p>Sikkema said he had not been allowed to speak to or visit his wife who is being held at Shanghai\u2019s Number Two Detention Centre. <br></p> <p>But he had written her a letter that he hoped would delivered by a lawyer on Monday.</p> <p>\u201cI love you. I\u2019m fine. Don\u2019t worry about me,\u201d the letter says. \u201cEverybody\u2019s working to get you out.\u201d</p> <p><em>Additional reporting by Christy Yao </em></p>"
