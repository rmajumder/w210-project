  "<p>For almost 75 years it has been a reassuring weekly fixture following an unchanged format, part of the fabric of the nation. But the pace and reach of social change appear to have left <em>Desert Island Discs</em> behind.</p> <p>A new poll suggests that only 31% of people in the UK would like a copy of the Bible to take to a desert island. The Radio 4 programme\u2019s imaginary castaways are given a Bible and the complete works of Shakespeare, along with their choice of eight pieces of music, another book and one luxury item.</p> <p>Reflecting the increasing secularity and diversity of British society, the poll found that 56% of respondents would not choose to take a Bible, and another 13% were unsure. Fewer than one in three welcomed the inclusion of a Bible in their musical and literary accompaniments to a solitary existence. There was a noticeable generational difference: 18% of 18-to-24-year-olds would choose a Bible, compared with 39% of over-65s.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/mar/11/desert-island-discs-roy-plomley-bbc-radio-4\">Roy Plomley, presenter of Desert Island Discs - interview, 1972</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The first <em>Desert Island Discs</em> was recorded in January 1942 featuring the musical choices of Vic Oliver, an Austrian-born actor and comedian. Since then, more than 3,000 people have agonised over their selections \u2013 and millions more have fantasised about their line-up should the BBC ever call.</p> <p>The programme was devised by broadcaster <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/mar/11/desert-island-discs-roy-plomley-bbc-radio-4\" title=\"\">Roy Plomley,</a> who presented it until his death in 1985, apart from a five-year break when it was off-air. He insisted on strict enforcement of the rules. After the death in 2012 of his widow, Diana Wong, who owned full rights to the show, there was speculation that the Bible might be dropped. But a BBC spokesman insisted there were \u201cno plans\u201d to remove it.</p> <p>Some guests have objected. In 2010, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/michael-mansfield\" title=\"\">Michael Mansfield,</a> the human rights lawyer, requested a bible of vegetarian cooking instead, only to be told by the presenter, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/kirsty-young\" title=\"\">Kirsty Young</a>, that he had no choice. In response to a complaint by the National Secular Society, Alice Feinstein, then the programme\u2019s editor, wrote: \u201cCastaways \u2026 are not forced to take a religious text \u2013 many choose not to take any religious book at all. Others do take one, but make the point they would read it simply as a piece of literature.\u201d</p> <p>David Walliams, the comedian, and David McVicar, the opera director, also refused the Bible. But novelist Philip Pullman, who is an atheist, accepted it, saying, \u201cThere are lots of good stories in the Bible.\u201d</p> <p>According to the <em>Guinness Book of Records</em>, the Bible is the most widely read book of all time, followed by <em>Quotations from the Works of Mao Tse-Tung</em> and the Harry Potter series.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ef6be2791343a6643811226b2bafec0a2dae1a02\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ef6be2791343a6643811226b2bafec0a2dae1a02/0_135_4004_2403/1000.jpg\" alt=\"David Walliams\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">David Walliams was one of the few guests on the Radio 4 show who refused to take the Bible to their desert island.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jeff Spicer/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Steve Cox, chairman of the Church and Media Network, which commissioned the poll from ComRes, said: \u201cDespite claims that we live in a secular country, it\u2019s encouraging to see a third of Brits still value the Bible as an important work. Whether you are a Christian or not, the Bible is an amazing book that gives accounts of life, love and hope.</p> <p>\u201cIt is wonderfully rich in texture, containing histories, letters, poetry and much more, describing the human condition, family, and the wrestling with all that life has thrown at humankind throughout the centuries: triumph, despair, courage, grief, redemption and hope.</p> <p>\u201cAs Christians we also happen to believe that it is not just a piece of literature, but God\u2019s word. I cannot think of a better book to take with me if I were to be stranded on a desert island.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Employment tribunals are supposed to be a recourse to justice, yet thousands of workers who win their claims never receive a penny of compensation. The government says it is committed to tackling the problem and forcing culpable employers to pay up. But new data reveals that its attempts fall woefully short, with the vast majority of unpaid claimants receiving no help at all.</p> <p>Grahame Healiss, 27, is one of a growing number of claimants let down by the system. He was sacked from his job at a call centre in Liverpool after complaining about his girlfriend being sexually harassed by a team leader. \u201cIt was a really disturbing time, seeing the most important person in my life being subjected to such blatant abuse,\u201d Healiss recalls. \u201cI had to do something.\u201d</p> <p>The couple took their case to tribunal and were awarded damages of \u00a340,000. Yet eight months on, no money has been paid. Their employer, M&amp;R Marketing, went into liquidation before the final hearing and dodged its liability. This is a common ruse.</p> <p>According to government data, more than a third of successful claimants never receive any of their compensation, and less than half are paid in full. \u201cFor some people, it\u2019s worse than if they\u2019d never taken the case in the first place,\u201d says Emma Satyamurti, a partner at law firm Leigh Day. \u201cIt compounds the sense of injustice.\u201d</p> <p>Lydia Stone, 31, has all but given up receiving any of the \u00a328,000 she was awarded three years ago for being unfairly sacked from an ice-cream parlour, Tom &amp; Erin\u2019s in Weymouth. Stone lost her job when she told her employer she was pregnant. \u201cThe next morning I had a letter from the owner saying my employment was over,\u201d she says. Stone took her case to an employment tribunal and received an unequivocal judgment: \u201cThe claimant was unlawfully discriminated against on the grounds of her sex,\u201d it says. Again, though, her former employer liquidated the company and transferred its assets to a sister company called Tom &amp; Erin\u2019s Gift Shop. It matters little that the new company is registered at the same address and sells the same products. \u201cThe shop is still there: it\u2019s open for business and selling ice cream. It just seems so wrong that they can get away with it,\u201d says Stone.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Even if it\u2019s obvious what a company has done, the costs involved in trying to challenge it outweigh the possible benefit</p> <footer> <cite>David Carter, debt collector</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>A spokesperson for the government\u2019s Insolvency Service admits there could be hundreds of cases like this every week. The problem is that it is hard, not to mention costly, to prove that companies are deliberately going bust to avoid paying awards.</p> <p>\u201cEven if it\u2019s obvious what a company has done, the costs involved in trying to challenge it outweigh the benefit,\u201d says David Carter of The Sheriff\u2019s Office, a debt collection firm. Carter says the transfer of assets between companies is something his firm encounters often, yet their hands are tied to do anything about it. \u201cThe government needs to tighten up the law.\u201d</p> <p>The problem could be addressed by denying public contracts to the offending businesses, disqualifying directors, and allowing employment tribunals to enforce payment directly. Earlier this year the government introduced fines for employers who don\u2019t pay up, but very little has changed. Figures seen by the <em>Observer </em>reveal that in the five months since the penalty system has been in place it has helped in 11 cases, bringing in \u00a355,000 in unpaid awards. According to TUC figures, that equates to just 1% of cases where successful claimants have not been paid.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to take some time for the system to bed in,\u201d said a spokesperson for the Department for Business. \u201cBut early signs are encouraging.\u201d</p> <p>TUC general secretary Frances O\u2019Grady says urgent change is needed: \u201cToo many employees who win cases don\u2019t get the money they\u2019re owed. The government must take tough action on employers who refuse to pay up.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Vultures are rarely viewed as the poster boys and girls of the natural world. They have repulsive eating habits and are strikingly ugly. Nevertheless, they play a critical role in maintaining the ecological health of many parts of the world.</p> <p>Vultures consume animal carcasses more effectively than any other scavengers and because their digestive juices contain acids that neutralise pathogens such as cholera and rabies they prevent diseases spreading. They act as dead-end hosts for numerous unpleasant ailments. But many ecologists are now warning that vultures across the planet are under serious threat thanks to habitat loss, deliberate and accidental poisoning, and use of the birds\u2019 body parts as traditional medicine cures.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/28/rare-bird-being-driven-to-extinction-by-poaching-for-its-red-ivory-bill\">Rare bird being driven to extinction by poaching for its 'red ivory' bill</a> </p> </aside>  <p>All these risks will be emphasised by British photographer Charlie Hamilton James in a series of images that will be shown as part of the <a href=\"http://www.nhm.ac.uk/visit/exhibitions/wildlife-photographer-of-the-year-52.html\" title=\"\">Wildlife Photographer of the Year exhibition,</a> which opens at the Natural History Museum this week.</p> <p>His photographs of vultures \u2013 and the growing environmental risks that threaten to wipe them out \u2013 have won Hamilton James the exhibition\u2019s wildlife photojournalist of the year award.</p> <p>\u201cI like underdogs,\u201d he said last week. \u201cThat is why I like vultures. The trouble is that vultures are now under such stress in the wild \u2013 for several reasons. They are facing a massive catastrophe yet they do so much for the environment and do so much to contain disease.\u201d</p> <p>Vultures are one of the fastest declining groups of animals in the world. In India, all nine species of the bird are threatened with extinction, largely through the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/jun/07/european-vultures-threat-diclofenac-vets-spain-italy\" title=\"\">indiscriminate use of diclofenac</a>, a common anti-inflammatory drug administered to livestock but which is lethal for the vultures that eat the corpses of cattle.</p> <p>\u201cThere is now a real danger that a disease like rabies will spread because there are hardly any vultures left to clean up corpses left in the open,\u201d Hamilton James said.</p> <p>In Africa \u2013 where vulture losses are expected to reach 70% to 97% over the next 50 years \u2013 the causes are more varied. One key factor is poisoning, both accidental and deliberate. Poachers use poison to kill elephants and rhinos \u2013 and to kill vultures to stop them circling in the skies over dead prey and alerting gamekeepers to the presence of dead animals and the poachers. \u201cThat is a major threat,\u201d said Hamilton James.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"23ad61ff35c5acaefab5a56c318bd6749c223cb8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/23ad61ff35c5acaefab5a56c318bd6749c223cb8/0_182_5472_3283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A market trader offers the body of a lappet-faced vulture at the Faraday muthi market in Johannesburg.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A market trader offers the body of a lappet-faced vulture at the Faraday muthi market in Johannesburg.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: \u00a9  Charlie Hamilton James</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Another factor in southern Africa is the use of vulture body parts in traditional medicine \u2013 known as <em>muthi</em> \u2013 as cures and treatments for a number of ailments and as sources of improved strength, speed and endurance.</p> <p>\u201cVulture brains are also dried, mixed with mud and smoked because it is thought that helps you see into the future,\u201d said Hamilton James.</p> <p>In one of his most telling images, a trader is seen selling the body of an endangered lappet-faced vulture at a muthi market in Johannesburg. \u201cThe market was full of bits of elephant, leopard, lion, snakes, owls, eagles and ostrich, as well as lots of plants,\u201d said Hamilton James.</p> <p>The skin of a pangolin, the most trafficked species in the world, is also visible in the photograph.</p> <p>Vultures can also be poisoned accidentally. Herders in Africa often lace dead cattle with poison in order to kill lions and other predators that raid their herds. The poison goes through the systems of both cattle and predator and is eaten by vultures, which then die.</p> <p>Habitat loss \u2013 caused by the spread of farming and city suburbs in Africa \u2013 is another critical factor in falling vulture numbers as is industrial and agricultural pollution. Power lines, which are spreading across the continent, also pose a risk, with birds flying into them on a regular basis.</p> <p>The crisis facing vultures is exacerbated by the fact that the birds develop very slowly. Vultures do not reach sexual maturity until they are between five and seven years old. They also breed slowly, with female birds laying only a single egg every one or two years. Each new chick is therefore critical to the survival of the&#xa0;species.</p> <p>Several conservation groups are now working to try to save the world\u2019s vultures, as is revealed in Hamilton James\u2019s photographs. They include the Namibian Vulture Project, which monitors endangered lappet-faced vultures in the Namib-Naukluft national park. The aerial survey takes four days and the plane travels 3,000km (1,865 miles).</p> <p>Active nests are identified and GPS coordinates sent to ground crews who check the nest with a car mirror extension \u2013 so as not to disturb any chicks \u2013 and then ring any they find.</p> <p>In South Africa, workers at the <a href=\"http://www.vulpro.com/\" title=\"\">VulPro</a> vulture conservation programme treat poisoned vultures with atropine and charcoal to try to help them recover. It is hard work, however. In 1922, the population of the local white-backed vulture was thought to be around 270,000. In 2015, it was 9,400. \u201cIt is a desperate problem,\u201d said Hamilton James.</p> <p><em>The Wildlife Photographer of the Year exhibition is at the Natural History Museum, South Kensington, London, from 21 October to 10 September 2017</em></p>",

Tens of thousands were swept up and into the arms of Scottish nationalism on waves of euphoria and no little expectation. Scotland might not yet have gained her independence but here was a party seemingly alive to the challenges of daily life in the country\u2019s most disadvantaged communities.

Yet, just a few yards away from the conference centre, another gathering was taking place in the Glasgow Science Centre. It calls itself <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/13/snp-old-politics-ideaspace-independence-vote\" title=\"\">Idea Space</a> and has been dubbed the SNP\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/momentum\" title=\"\">Momentum</a> shadow.

Any event held outwith this does not benefit the party, and your involvement in such events means that you are not available to support events on the official fringe during that time.\u201d</p> <p>The SNP might claim they are simply protecting their interests but the email suggests an organisation where ideas must be inspected from every angle, put through the party wringer and rendered pure and spotless before they can be entertained at something as august as the main conference.</p> <p>Many of the participants in Idea Space are charities and third sector organisations who had been accustomed to setting out their stalls at the main SNP conference. This year, though, an eye-watering hike in the fees charged by the party has forced many of them into the Science Centre for the festival of ideas. Among them are <a href=\"http://www.oxfam.org.uk/scotland/blog\" title=\"\">Oxfam Scotland</a>, the tenants union <a href=\"http://www.livingrent.org/\" title=\"\">Living Rent</a>, land reform movement <a href=\"http://www.ourland.scot/\" title=\"\">Our Land</a>, the leading think tank <a href=\"https://www.compassonline.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Compass</a>, the <a href=\"http://neweconomics.org/\" title=\"\">New Economics Foundation</a>, <a href=\"http://www.scottishpsc.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Scottish Palestine Solidarity Campaign</a> and <a href=\"http://www.foe-scotland.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Friends of the Earth Scotland</a>. Their presence in previous years contributed to a pleasingly chaotic and unfettered atmosphere around the SNP conference that was gloriously unlike the controlled austerity of Labour and the Tories.</p> <p>The stiff asking prices for the privilege of being represented at the official conference are no problem for some organisations in the private sector. Among them is Heathrow airport, which is hosting a \u201cprivate airport-style lounge\u201d and bar. Neither Heathrow nor the SNP would reveal the price agreed for bestowing such largesse to existing and future clients, but it\u2019s known that the party has been charging up to \u00a323,000 for packages such as these.

The genre simply does not require it. The average viewer might only experience an orgy in his dreams, often compromised by the sudden arrival of Princess Anne singing show tunes, but this is pornography. It\u2019s a fantasy genre already. Orgies are its reality.</p> <p>Note the \u201cmagical realism\u201d of porn: any postman can make a special delivery, and he doesn\u2019t have to bang his head on a step to do it.</p> <h2><strong>The Crush</strong></h2> <p>As in Greek tragedy, a porn film\u2019s outcome is prescribed from the start. Porn has less <em>stichomythia</em> than classical drama, and more plastic tits, but the genres share a reluctance to rely on suspense.</p> <p>Thus, when the opening credits of <em>The Crush </em>show rugged Colby Taylor gazing wistfully at his muscly old college buddy Travis, this acts by way of a Chorus, presaging the action to come.</p> <p>Colby explains to Travis that he once <a href=\"http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=tonk&amp;page=3\" title=\"\">tonked</a> gleefully for 10 full minutes while watching two studs pleasure each other on the bonnet of a Mustang. All this is played out in oily flashback; when Colby finally returns from his reverie, Travis asks: \u201cWhat are you trying to say?\u201d</p> <p>Thus the porn auteur\u2019s dilemma. The artistic vision demands a lingering uncertainty, but the form demands an immediate and mind-boggling frot.</p> <p>In response, previously-straight Travis whips off his trousers. His self-realisation or <em>anagnorisis</em> is one that might take a man years to embrace. But the Aristotelian unities of porn must be obeyed: Travis and Colby have got to go at it before the sun sets.</p> <h2><strong>The Devil In Miss Jones 6</strong></h2> <p>There\u2019s a lot of girl-on-girl action in hell. According to this film, Satan is female; you can tell she\u2019s Satan because she\u2019s smoking a cigarette. And you can tell it\u2019s hell because she\u2019s playing golf.</p> <p>Satan\u2019s duties consist of presiding over lesbian writhings and practising her putting. She has to drop putter and dildo, however, when two minions disappear up to Earth \u2013 summoned by papyrologist Arthur (beautifully played by Randy Spears, the blue Alec Guinness), who has accidentally read out a sex incantation from an ancient gospel.</p> <p>What blessed text is this? The Gospel According to Ron Jeremy? The big question is why the sacred scripture has never been turned into a porn film in its own right.</p> <h2><strong>In The Can With OJ</strong></h2> <p>Just as Oliver Stone\u2019s <em>JFK</em> gave the world a fresh perspective on the Kennedy assassination, so writer-director Gregory Black\u2019s X-rated re-telling of the OJ Simpson story challenges the viewer to rethink all her assumptions about this notorious murder case.</p> <p>In calling his characters \u201cOJ Sampson and wife Natalie\u201d, Black implicitly asks: \u201cHave these people been fictionalised, somehow, in the public consciousness?\u201d</p> <p>Black demolishes the argument that this was a sexually motivated crime, by offering us the dullest humping ever screened. It takes a master director to give us this much sex and none of it interesting.</p> <p>Some people believe that OJ was set up and had been watched for months before the murder; Black hints cleverly at these theories by allowing us, throughout the film, to spot visible wires, tripods and occasionally the foot of a cameraman.</p> <p>In another skilful twist, Black renders the sound almost inaudible, as if to ask: \u201cCan we ever really understand the whole truth?\u201d We certainly can\u2019t understand a word spoken by \u201cHal Cadillac\u201d (otherwise delightfully played by Big Herc).</p> <p>We don\u2019t see the actual killing \u2013 although a couple of brutal murders could hardly have made the film any less sexy than it already is. Neither is there any depiction of the court case, which is a shame, as there could have been a lot of potential in Judge Ito\u2019s gavel.</p>",

The effusions of the prime minister about \u201cthwarting the will of the people\u201d remind me of Europe\u2019s pre-war dictators.</p> <p>It will not be enough for parliament to vote on the withdrawal procedure or dream of another vote when that procedure has reached its inexorable end.

We do not know if there is a majority in the country against it and we do know that many value the input of EU immigrants to the country. Presumably, at least a few Leave voters were simply in favour of more free trade with the wider world, and some simply taken by the call to reclaim sovereignty.</p> <p>Given the margin of 52% to 48%, it would only take just over one per cent of the voters to fall into each category for there to be a narrow majority in favour of Leaving, but without a majority for refusing freedom of movement. And narrow majorities are all we are relying on. In that case, Theresa May\u2019s government is going beyond its mandate in assuming that soft Brexit must be off the agenda. And MPs would be within their rights to demand soft Brexit, failing any other referendum explicitly dealing with immigration (perish the thought!).<br><strong>Nigel Blake</strong><br>Byfleet, Surrey</p> <p>Years of Tory underspending have brought about shortages in hospital beds, affordable housing and school places \u2013 the very things for which many Brexiters blame immigrants.

  "<p>With dreary predictability, there have been calls for Olympian Jessica Ennis-Hill to apologise to footballer Ched Evans for saying (after his initial conviction for rape, which has now been overturned) that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/nov/13/jessica-ennis-hill-name-stand-ched-evans-contract-sheffield-united\">she wanted her name removed</a> from a stand in Sheffield United\u2019s ground if the club offered him another contract. Why should Ennis-Hill apologise? At the time of her statement, Evans <em>had</em> been found guilty. Even now, isn\u2019t Ennis-Hill entitled to subscribe to the widely held view that Evans\u2019s behaviour was disgusting?</p> <p>As far as the actual case goes, there\u2019s been a definitive legal decision, however much some people disagree with it. (Those interested in issues raised by the case might care to take a look at the <a href=\"https://thesecretbarrister.com/\">Secret Barrister</a> website, which, among other interesting observations, contends that the case did not set a precedent for women being grilled on their sexual history.) Legality aside, what Evans might find himself dealing with from now on is the wider public response to the sickening, self-justifying culture he\u2019s come to represent and the importance of personal responsibility.</p> <p>To my mind, this has long gone beyond the world of overpaid, sexually messy footballers. Despite all the money sloshing around, football has miraculously remained one of the few areas of public life where those at the top tend to come from working-class backgrounds, which is something to be proud of. But how is it possible to be \u201cproud\u201d of a grubby, self-gratifying world where, in too many cases, the personal nightlife \u201cperks\u201d have revolved around budget hotel rooms, crude phone footage and impressionable, outnumbered women?</p> <p>For me, it\u2019s also gone beyond legality, important though that is. This has become about everyone, but mainly a certain breed of calculating men, taking absolute responsibility for their sexual conduct. This isn\u2019t kneejerk moralising (wanting sex to only happen between sober married people, with the lights out); personally, I couldn\u2019t care less what people get up to behind closed Travelodge doors. This is about sexually active adults acknowledging that there has to be a baseline of mutual human respect, instead of what so often happens (disrespecting certain women, targeting certain women, using certain women), with the men all the while cynically reassuring themselves that what they\u2019re doing is legal (\u201cconsented\u201d), ending all thoughts of accountability.</p> <p>In America, following the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/10/university-of-colorado-sexual-assault-austin-wilkerson\">Colorado college rape uproar,</a> it was reported that (sometimes drunken) prospective sexual partners were being filmed on mobile phones \u201cconsenting\u201d to sex, as if being able to speak semi-coherently for a few seconds is all the proof that\u2019s needed. Instead of this arse-covering farce (if someone\u2019s so drunk that you have to film them giving consent, then postpone the sex), there\u2019s this other brilliant solution, which is being a decent human being.</p> <p>This means recognising, as decent human beings tend to do, that not only are equivalent levels of inebriation crucial, but also that in every single sexual situation, both parties have (or should have) an unwritten, but necessary and complex, \u201cduty of care\u201d to each other. That, as well as what\u2019s happening physically, there are the all-important grey areas on the emotional peripheries of sex where mutual trust and respect are key and non-negotiable.</p> <p>When this baseline is achieved, and only then, it becomes irrelevant how casual the sex is, how little the participants know each other, or whether someone likes their sex \u201crough\u201d. How depressing that sexually active adults can\u2019t lead with this attitude of basic respect, instead of being cynical, manipulative and disingenuous. Even S&amp;M practitioners tend to have a \u201csafe word\u201d, which, when said, stops everything. Perhaps that\u2019s it \u2013 it\u2019s come to the point that so-called normal, casual sex culture needs to have its own safe word? Let me help with a few of them: if a woman is good enough to have sex with, then she\u2019s good enough, full stop.</p> <h2>Now, perhaps, they\u2019ll rebrand obesity</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b19d8e31d91efcaf484d023e31e8957d9b04947c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b19d8e31d91efcaf484d023e31e8957d9b04947c/0_83_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Will overweight middle-class children get called \u2018lazy\u2019 too?\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Will overweight middle-class children get called \u2018lazy\u2019 too?</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris Radburn/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A study in Leeds reports that middle-class children are the most likely to be obese. The study, a collaboration between the education authority, city council, and Leeds Metropolitan University, scrutinised 13,333 children over three years, finding that those in \u201cmiddle-affluent\u201d neighbourhoods were more likely to be obese than children in the richest or poorest neighbourhoods.</p> <p>This rather contradicts the perceived wisdom on obesity \u2013 which is that the poorest children are likely to be the heaviest, because they have less access to nutritious food, and more likelihood of eating cheap unhealthy diets.</p> <p>With this in mind, these results do seem surprising, raising questions about the impact that living in particular areas has on weight \u2013 whether, for instance, a proliferation of high-profile fast-food joints (which poorer people might not be able to afford on a regular basis) would affect weight more than poverty? Social mores could also be factored in \u2013 are children in more middle-class areas more likely to be over-indulged, or to over-eat because they feel under pressure from parent, school or peer groups?</p> <p>Then there\u2019s the public perception of obesity and the judgments that are made \u2013 is that all going to change, too? When it was mainly about obese poor people (of any age), it was all about them being lazy, disgusting losers who \u201cdeserved\u201d to be fat. Now that the finger is pointing at the middle classes, are they going to get the \u201clazy, disgusting loser\u201d treatment, too?</p> <p>Or might there be a \u201crebranding\u201d of obesity, as another kind of food disorder \u2013 where the overeating is out of an individual\u2019s control?</p> <p>I wouldn\u2019t complain \u2013 I think it\u2019s vile how overweight people are attacked.

  "<p>Two years ago, when asked<em> </em>what she wished she was better at, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/lilyallen\" title=\"\">Lily Allen</a> offered a concise reply. \u201cPress. Shutting up. Self-censorship,\u201d she told me, nonetheless proceeding to say many entertaining things that could have got her into trouble. The singer seems constitutionally incapable of taking the easy route.</p> <p>Last Wednesday Allen posted a video about her visit to the Calais refugee camp, in which she told a 13-year-old Afghan: \u201cI apologise on behalf of my country. I\u2019m sorry for what we have put you through.\u201d The social media backlash was fierce and predictable, as was the response from rightwing tabloids. The <em>Daily Mail</em>\u2019s Jan Moir dismissed Allen\u2019s tears in the video as \u201cpatronising and self-indulgent\u201d, although some might prefer to interpret her distress as something called empathy. Allen stood her ground.</p> <p>The 31-year-old singer, who has described herself as \u201can argumentative little shit\u201d, has been both loved and hated by the press and public for a decade now, as is the fate of pop stars with opinions. Nothing she\u2019s experienced has had the effect of muting her voice. She remains bracingly fearless \u2013 an incorrigible fly in the ointment.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>She was instantly captivating because there seemed to be no distance between her music and her personality</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In July she tweeted a photograph that summed up her unusual position in British life. It was a surreptitious snap of Rupert Murdoch, Nigel Farage and Evgeny Lebedev at a garden party, with the caption: \u201cHope I\u2019m not sitting next to Voldemort or Fromage. I might be sick.\u201d The tweet revealed that Allen is enough of an insider to get invited to a party like that and enough of an outsider to not care about being invited back. After 10 years of fame, she still feels like an interloper, making fun of the celebrity circus from the inside.</p> <p>Allen knew a fair bit about showbusiness long before she recorded her first single. Her father, who left when she was four, is actor and hellraiser <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2005/aug/21/2\" title=\"\">Keith Allen</a>, her mother is film producer Alison Owen, and for three years her stepfather was Harry Enfield. Family friends included Joe Strummer and Damien Hirst. It was a privileged childhood in some ways but a complicated one. \u201cI had quite a turbulent upbringing,\u201d she told the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2006/may/21/popandrock.lilyallen\" title=\"\"><em>Observer</em> in her first major interview</a>. \u201cIt was middle class and everything was quite comfortable, but everyone was mental.\u201d</p> <p>She was a lonely, introverted child and a wild teenager who attended 13 schools before dropping out altogether at the age of 15. She did everything young, from drugs to therapy, and couldn\u2019t wait to be an adult. She set her sights on fame, believing it the fastest route to independence and self-worth. (Her younger brother Alfie became an actor, best known as Theon Greyjoy in <em>Game of Thrones</em>.)</p> <p>Allen\u2019s first record deal, with London Records when she was 16, was facilitated by family connections but nothing came of it. As the offspring of celebrities far more famous than Keith Allen will tell you, a foot in the door is not enough. When she signed to EMI for a modest sum in 2005, she was a low priority and the label only really paid attention once she had built up a following herself by posting demos and mixtapes on MySpace.</p> <p>She was instantly captivating because there seemed to be no distance between her music and her personality. On her 2006 debut album <em>Alright, Still</em>, Allen sang about her ex-boyfriend (Smile), her family (Alfie) and everyday life (LDN) with charming directness and caustic wit. Admiring critics compared her with the Specials and the Streets while fans embraced her as One of Us. The album sold 2.5 million copies and BBC3 offered her a short-lived chat show, <em>Lily Allen and Friends</em>. The scale of her success took her by surprise and she often talked about her pop career as a temporary phase rather than a dream fulfilled. This nonchalance enabled her to play less safe than more conventionally ambitious singers.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f08a512d9125c566c45cb5ef9252bd5249a650c9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f08a512d9125c566c45cb5ef9252bd5249a650c9/0_160_3636_2182/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lily Allen at a concert in London in June to celebrate the life of murdered MP Jo Cox\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lily Allen at a concert in London in June to celebrate the life of murdered MP Jo Cox.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alastair Grant/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In an era of media-trained pop stars, Allen was as refreshingly unvarnished as her contemporary Amy Winehouse, albeit more robust. She was funny and opinionated, speaking freely about body image, insecurity and misogyny. She was also easily riled, calling Bob Geldof \u201ca sanctimonious prat\u201d and waging a nasty feud with Cheryl Cole that she later regretted.</p> <p>To her discomfort, the tabloids couldn\u2019t get enough of her. \u201cIf you ask most people, Who\u2019s Lily Allen?, they\u2019ll say, That girl who\u2019s in the papers all the time. Not that girl who wrote songs,\u201d she said. In fact, she\u2019s an astute lyricist who accurately describes her forte as \u201cwry social observations and intimate details of relationships\u201d, and her voice, especially on ballads, has a winning clarity and vulnerability.</p> <p>Her relationship with the tabloids was tense. In 2007 she was arrested for allegedly assaulting a paparazzo. A few months later the <em>Sun</em> published news of her first pregnancy before her three-month scan; she later miscarried.</p> <p>Routinely besieged by the paparazzi, she summed up her ambivalence about celebrity in her <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/may/20/lily-allen-ivor-novello-awards1\" title=\"\">Ivor Novello award-winning</a> 2009 single <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P191zutE1D0\" title=\"\">The Fear</a>, which is still her best song: \u201cI am a weapon of massive consumption / And it\u2019s not my fault, it\u2019s how I\u2019m programmed to function.\u201d The song works so well because she implicates herself in the worst aspects of the fame industry. Indeed, her behaviour at the time was \u201cself-destructive\u201d and out of control. \u201cI\u2019m such a hypocrite,\u201d she said. \u201cBut that\u2019s why I love that song so much, because it\u2019s so ironic and contradictory.\u201d</p> <p>In 2010 Allen quit music \u2013 for good, she thought \u2013 in order to move to Gloucestershire and start a family with Sam Cooper, an old friend whom she married the following year. The couple, who separated recently, have two daughters. On Twitter, she renamed herself Lily Rose Cooper, as if to say that Lily Allen, pop star, was history. Allen had been talking about leaving the music industry as far back as her first album, but the quiet life left her unfulfilled, and the <em>Bridget Jones</em> musical she was co-writing fell through. In 2012 she began writing songs again with producer Greg Kurstin.</p> <p>Her 2013 comeback sent mixed messages. A delicate cover of Keane\u2019s Somewhere Only We Know for John Lewis\u2019s Christmas ad campaign was followed by the boisterous satire of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0CazRHB0so\" title=\"\">Hard Out Here</a>. The song itself was a feminist statement about the treatment of women in the music industry but the video, which parodied clips such as Robin Thicke\u2019s notorious Blurred Lines, botched the message by seeming to reinforce the stereotypes she was trying to critique. She received a shellacking online.</p> <p>Attacking her use of women of colour in the video, the critic Julianne Escobedo Shepherd accused Allen of \u201cusing racism to skewer sexism\u201d. Even without that controversy, Allen seemed conflicted about returning to the pop fray. Among the songs about marriage and womanhood on her patchy third album, <em>Sheezus,</em> (a pun on Kanye West\u2019s <em>Yeezus</em>) were angry sideswipes at celebrity culture and internet trolls. She described it as \u201ca vomit of stuff that\u2019s happened to me over the last few years\u201d. Reviews were mixed and sales disappointing.</p> <p>A fourth album, which will reunite her with producer Mark Ronson, is yet to arrive but Allen\u2019s fame rolls on regardless.</p> <p>Having previously joined campaigns relating to climate change and internet piracy, she has become increasingly politically outspoken on Twitter. She\u2019s a staunch supporter of Jeremy Corbyn (she called Tom Watson \u201ca snake\u201d last month for appearing to undermine the Labour leader), a backer of the Women\u2019s Equality party, and an opponent of Brexit.</p> <p>In April <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/apr/16/lily-allen-stalked-singer-police\" title=\"\">she spoke openly</a> about the man who had stalked her for the last seven years, in order to highlight harassment of women and the inadequate police response. The visit to Calais is further evidence of her desire to use her profile productively, regardless of the consequences.</p> <p>Unlike some celebrity activists, Allen is not sanctimonious. \u201cI\u2019m not a prophet, I\u2019m not a politician, I\u2019m not a game-changer,\u201d she told me. She has always been open about her contradictions and shortcomings, in both her interviews and songs, and this openness is her most likable quality.</p> <p>Most famous people understandably erect walls to protect themselves, absenting themselves from social media and avoiding tricky subjects in interviews. In order to make themselves less vulnerable, they make themselves less interesting.</p> <p>Allen may be happier than 10 years ago but she is scarcely less forceful, as if any serious concession to diplomacy would be an admission of defeat. She has said that women in the music industry have often been told: \u201cKeep your mouth shut or people will laugh at you,\u201d so she speaks her mind out of defiance rather than arrogance. Also, perhaps, because she just can\u2019t help herself. Allen once said her ambition, as a teenager, was to \u201cmake a lot of noise\u201d. In that respect, she has succeeded in spades.</p> <h2>THE ALLEN FILE</h2> <p><strong>Born</strong> Lily Rose Beatrice Allen, on 2 May, 1985 in London.</p> <p><strong>Best of times</strong> Winning three Ivor Novello songwriting awards for her 2009 album <em>It\u2019s Not You, It\u2019s Me</em> and her single The Fear.</p> <p><strong>Worst of times</strong> Her second miscarriage in 2011, which led to life-threatening septicaemia. \u201cIt\u2019s not something that you get over,\u201d she said.</p> <p><strong>What she says</strong> \u201cThe world is run on fear and shame.

Massacres, public tortures and executions, and a slave trade on an industrial scale were a daily reality in the areas held by Isis \u2013 not to mention the destruction of many <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/04/isis-destroys-ancient-tombs-palmyra\">historic sites and artifacts</a>. And they seemed to be moving in for the kill: preparing to take <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2016/mar/11/syria-civil-war-life-damascus-not-lose-hope-video\">Damascus</a> and rule the country by right of conquest. The establishment of a terrorist state in Syria would pose a grave threat to Russia and Europe.</p> <p>A year after Russia sent in its air force, reacting to a request from the legitimate government of Syria, the picture looks different. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/11/isis-ranks-dwindle-to-15000-amid-retreat-on-all-fronts-claims-pentagon\">Isis is in retreat</a>, having lost more than 4,600 square miles of territory and up to 35,000 fighters. The Syrian army and local militia freed 586 towns and villages from Isis. Their leaders \u2013 who a year ago promised to bring slaughter and chaos to other regions, including Europe \u2013 went remarkably silent.</p> <p>But Russia didn\u2019t come to Syria to fight the war. We came to deliver the country from terrorists and extremists, and to create conditions for a peace process. With Isis gangs no longer threatening Damascus and many other cities, Syrians have a chance to settle their political, ethnic and religious differences at a negotiating table. Talks have started between the government and many patriotic opposition groups. At local level, many villages and towns have joined the ceasefire regime (783, and the number grows daily) brokered by the Russian military.</p> <p>The combat is tough in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/14/syrian-regime-bombs-hospital-again-assad-vows-clean-aleppo\">Aleppo</a>, where the Syrian army is wrestling with the rebels, over half of whom belong to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/28/al-qaida-syria-nusra-split-terror-network\">Jabhat al-Nusra</a>, an offspring of al-Qaida, internationally recognised as terrorists.

Human suffering, a horrible byproduct of any war (the expression \u201ccollateral damage\u201d wasn\u2019t invented by us or President Assad), is being exploited to rally to the terrorists\u2019 cause.

We champion a political solution, which will include all political forces in Syria and ensure its future as a secular, pluralistic nation. We deliver humanitarian aid. And remember, Russia was not the one to quit all efforts to arrange a ceasefire in Aleppo, which cannot be achieved on terrorists\u2019 terms.</p> <p>This is where we stand. We are not ashamed to be part of a complex solution in Syria and call on others to join us. For that, our western partners will have to forget about regime change in Syria, and leave it to the Syrians to decide for themselves. After all, terrorists do not offer the Syrians a vote. Theirs is an end-of-history rule, with all other options closed.</p>",

The pair had met in 1989 at Cambridge University, where they both studied.</p> <p>Vines was found guilty at Oxford crown court of breaching a restraining order. However he had previous convictions, including for breaches of restraining orders in 2008, 2010, 2013, 2014 and also earlier this year, for which he was not given a custodial sentence. Before being sentenced at the beginning of September, Vines refused to commit to a pledge made earlier in the trial that, if convicted, he would never contact Maitlis and her family again. He told the court: \u201cI will never contact them again if I\u2019m defeated rationally in court \u2013 and I cannot say I have been today.\u201d</p> <p>The Plaid Cymru peer Lord Wigley is proposing an amendment to the policing and crime bill, due to be debated next month in the Lords, to increase the powers of the attorney general to refer such cases to the court of appeal. Wigley said: \u201cThe laws on leniency in sentencing need updating. There have been a number of disturbing instances recently of such leniency, but at the moment they are not offences that can be referred. The amendments would make that possible.\u201d</p> <p>It is understood the government has privately offered support to the change.</p> <p>Harry Fletcher, director of <a href=\"http://www.voice4victims.co.uk\">Voice4Victims</a>, who drafted the amendments, said that in cases of stalking, where the convicted person showed no remorse for their behaviour, it was crucial for the courts to keep them off the streets. \u201cThe law on the ability of the attorney general to refer such cases to the court of appeal needs urgent revision\u201d, he said.</p> <p><a>Claire Waxman, a mother of two who was aggressively harassed by a former classmate</a> for more than a decade, was also involved in drafting the change as founder and director of Voice4Victims.</p> <p>Her stalker, college acquaintance Elliot Fogel, 40, was prosecuted five times, jailed three times, and given a suspended sentence and a community order for his crimes in the past.</p> <p>Yet it was only in April last year that Fogel, a former Sky Sports news producer, was sentenced to three-and-a-half years in prison after being found guilty of breaching a restraining order that banned him from ever contacting his victim.</p> <p>Waxman said: \u201cIt takes a lot of courage for a victim to come forward and face the ordeal of the justice process. When an unduly lenient sentence is then passed and the victim cannot have their case referred to the attorney general, because the scheme is outdated, justice has failed.</p> <p>\u201cThis is devastating for a victim, especially when all perpetrators have the right to appeal against their sentences, but it\u2019s not the same from the victim\u2019s side.

Anti-EU newspaper columnists in pro-Brexit papers were speaking out too, and in the high court a group of QCs warned that Brexit was being driven through in an unconstitutional, undemocratic way.</p> <p>The worries among politicians, businesspeople and opinion formers are broadly twofold: first, that MPs in parliament might be bypassed when the country decides what kind of Brexit we pursue; and, second, that May and her ministers seem so ready to ditch single-market membership in order to control immigration.</p> <p>The Labour MP Pat McFadden, a leading member of the Open Europe campaign that is battling to keep close ties with the EU, said: \u201cThis was the week when the reality of Brexit began to bite \u2013 in our economy, in our parliament and in our public debate. Issues that featured little before 23 June \u2013 like the value of the currency, the impact on prices, and what\u2019s at stake with the single market \u2013 have come to the fore.\u201d</p> <h2>What they\u2019re saying:<br>Rightwing commentators<br></h2> <p>After campaigning for Brexitand trumpeting the economy\u2019s resilience in its aftermath, some commentators on the right now sound queasy about bypassing parliament, ignoring the interests of the 48% who voted Remain, and turning our backs on the single market.</p> <p>Veteran columnist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/georgemonbiot/2011/may/13/christopher-booker-misleading\">Christopher Booker</a> has been savage about the EU for decades but now appears worried that Britain is about to leave in a manner that will seriously damage the economy. On Monday he wrote that \u201cthose who have done their homework\u201d had worked out that \u201cthe only interim arrangement that could conceivably work is the soft Brexit option\u201d. His preferred version is to remain in the European Economic Area, then applying \u201cto join the two richest countries per capita in Europe, Norway and Switzerland, in the European Free Trade Area (Efta)\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"f4905f14f85ae9256739e907a33a56bf16fd23a1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f4905f14f85ae9256739e907a33a56bf16fd23a1/0_0_3744_4680/800.jpg\" alt=\"Charles Moore said the 48% who voted Remain \u2018are not a negligible rump\u2019.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Charles Moore said the 48% who voted Remain \u2018are not a negligible rump\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Eamonn McCabe/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Philip Johnston wrote in the<em> Telegraph</em> about the need to involve MPs: \u201cIf the \u2018will of the people\u2019 is to supplant that of parliament then we must move towards a plebiscite democracy and away from a parliamentary one. Is that what we want? The alternative is that the executive decides these matters on its own with no proper accountability. That really is a democratic deficit. Actually, let\u2019s not mince words. That\u2019s dictatorship.\u201d</p> <p>And the Eurosceptic sage Charles Moore, former <em>Spectator </em>and<em> Telegraph</em> editor, wrote: \u201cMay in her [conference] speech did not try hard enough to mingle the victorious and the defeated in the EU referendum. After all, 48% of those voting, including one Theresa May, lost. They are not a negligible rump. Nor \u2026 are they unpatriotic. They should not be outlawed from the next chapter of our island story.\u201d</p> <h2>Business leaders<br></h2> <p>Many leaders of big business were appalled by the Brexit vote but hadn\u2019t in their worst dreams imagined that it would mean leaving the single market. Ministerial talk over the past week has, however, made that seem increasingly likely, triggering sterling\u2019s fall. The period of post-referendum calm is over.</p> <p>Leading the chorus of concern last week was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/10/hard-brexit-risks-destroying-uks-open-economy-says-cbi-chief\">Carolyn Fairbairn, director general of the CBI</a>. \u201cWhat we have heard over the past few days, if you add up the messages, are signs that the door is being closed on the open economy, which has helped fuel investment. It\u2019s very clear from conversations we are having that the world is watching. International investors are watching. Companies here are watching. And they are reading a lot into the signals of this government about how committed they are to creating a strong economy.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"51684a3251b233f775a1b77830b7f52d6c9e3739\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/51684a3251b233f775a1b77830b7f52d6c9e3739/1517_168_1475_1844/800.jpg\" alt=\"Carolyn Fairbairn, director general of the CBI\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Carolyn Fairbairn, the director general of the CBI, warned of signs the door was being closed on the open economy.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paul Hackett/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The EEF (formerly the Engineering Employers\u2019 Federation) warned of disastrous results if the UK leaves the single market and shuts the door on EU migrants: \u201cRushing into a deal at any cost would be calamitous for business \u2026 We must protect access to the single market and the ability of businesses to hire and deploy staff as they need to.\u201d</p> <p>Car manufacturer Nissan received reassurances from the government that it would not be harmed by Brexit, and would not have to pull investment plans. But doubts persist.</p> <h2>MPs of all stripes<br></h2> <p>Surprising alliances were struck in the Commons last week, with Tory MPs, including some who backed Brexit, teaming up with Labour, Scottish Nationalist and Liberal Democrat colleagues.</p> <p>The Eurosceptic hard core who caused trouble for successive Tory leaders is being replaced by an equally awkward squad of soft Brexiters. Some want parliament involved, others stress the importance of the single market, and plenty want both.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/andrewtyrie\">Andrew Tyrie</a>, the pro-Brexit Conservative MP who chairs the treasury select committee, told the House: \u201cWe want a high degree of access to the single market, in my view. To fall back immediately on World Trade Organisation rules would risk an economic shock and certainly an economic downturn, given the high degree of trade integration at the moment between Britain and the EU.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/11/we-voted-brexit-keep-parliament-sovereign-wont-be-gagged\">Stephen Phillips,</a> the Conservative member for Sleaford and North Hykeham, who backed Brexit, emerged suddenly as a rebel. \u201cI and many others did not exercise our vote in the referendum so as to restore the sovereignty of this parliament only to see what we regarded as the tyranny of the European Union replaced by that of a government that apparently wishes to ignore the views of the house on the most important issue facing the nation.\u201d</p> <p>Labour sharpened up its act as Keir Starmer, MP for Holborn and St Pancras, and its new Brexit spokesman, argued that his party was not trying to stop Brexit but wanted MPs to be involved in deciding the least damaging route to the exit door. Plenty of Tories agreed.</p> <h2>Traders and consumers<br></h2> <p>Theresa May has reassured Leave voters that she will take Britain out of the EU by saying \u201cBrexit means Brexit\u201d but if people begin to think it also means rising prices, more expensive holidays and higher inflation, she may need to find another catchphrase.</p> <p>On Tuesday, ITV ran an item on its main evening news bulletin from a London market and canvassed views on the effect of sterling\u2019s fall on traders and shoppers. A fruit seller said he\u2019d had to push up the price of tangerines by 20%. \u201cAt the weekend it was \u00a31 a pound, now we are having to go \u00a31.20.\u201d</p> <p>A florist said the price of flowers from the Netherlands had doubled in three months and she was concerned that she would lose business.</p> <p>This was before <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/oct/13/pound-sterling-brexit-price-row-tesco-unilever-live\">\u201cMarmitegate\u201d </a>, when Tesco removed products from its shelves in a dispute with its supplier, Unilever, which wanted to increase the price of its household goods and groceries by 10%.</p> <p>The governor of the Bank of England, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/14/prices-to-continue-rising-warns-bank-of-england-governor\">Mark Carney</a>, said he would tolerate inflation going up \u201ca bit\u201d. Now market analysts expect it to rise from its current 0.6% level to above 2.5% over the next two years. With wages unlikely to follow suit, will hard Brexit still look like such a good idea?</p> <h2>Senior lawyers<br></h2> <p>Senior lawyers last week launched a case in the high court, arguing that ministers acting alone should not be able to trigger <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/article-50\">Article 50</a>, the process that will lead to Britain\u2019s withdrawal from the EU.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"adc449b525cad4b11aa3ae8e86eb73356b92c184\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/adc449b525cad4b11aa3ae8e86eb73356b92c184/870_0_2323_2903/800.jpg\" alt=\"Gina Miller at the high court\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gina Miller arrives at the high court for the challenge to Theresa May\u2019s right to trigger article 50 without a parliamentary vote.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hannah Mckay/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>They argued that parliament should be involved in that process and that it should not be done through the use of the royal prerogative, as currently planned.

Notification of a withdrawal inevitably leads to the removal of the rights of UK citizens, whatever they may be.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Boris Johnson\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/13/boris-johnson-military-options-against-syrian-regime-being-considered\" title=\"\">suggestion that Britain, the US and other allies are re-examining \u201cmilitary options\u201d </a>in Syria has sharply focused minds on a phenomenon western politicians have spent the last 15 years trying not to think about: post-Soviet Russia\u2019s determined drive to re-establish itself as a major global power and the willingness of its ruthless and tactically astute leader, Vladimir Putin, to employ almost any means, including use of force, to achieve that end.</p> <p>The foreign secretary\u2019s remarks were condemned by Moscow as an attempt to whip up anti-Russian \u201chysteria\u201d and were swiftly disowned by a nervous Downing Street. Johnson\u2019s call for demonstrations outside Russia\u2019s London embassy <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/12/russia-boris-johnson-syria-aleppo-war-crime-russophobic-hysteria\" title=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/12/russia-boris-johnson-syria-aleppo-war-crime-russophobic-hysteria\">invited similar, retaliatory action</a> against British interests in Moscow. The gaffe underlined his inexperience and lack of judgment.</p> <p>But on Syria\u2019s plight, and particularly on war crimes allegedly committed during the relentless \u201cpulverising\u201d of Aleppo, Johnson had a point. His comments served to highlight the much bigger strategic, security and diplomatic problem: what to do about Russia.</p> <p>Military options are indeed being discussed again in Washington, from where Britain usually takes its cue. The key question is no longer how best to remove the Syrian dictator, Bashar al-Assad. It is how to stop the Russian military, Assad\u2019s main backer, which is held responsible, directly or indirectly, for numerous lethal aerial attacks against civilians, hospitals and schools, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/19/syria-ceasefire-is-over-says-countrys-military\" title=\"\">last month\u2019s destruction of a UN aid convoy</a>.</p> <p>So furious was John Kerry, the US secretary of state, at what he saw as Moscow\u2019s deliberate sabotage of the latest Syria ceasefire that he broke off bilateral talks with Moscow. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/25/russia-accused-war-crimes-syria-un-security-council-aleppo\" title=\"\">Samantha Power, US ambassador to the UN, accused Russia of \u201cbarbarism\u201d</a>. But repeating a pattern of behaviour familiar in Ukraine, Georgia and other crises, an unabashed Putin refused to back down. On the contrary, he rapidly upped the ante.</p> <p>Within days of Kerry\u2019s move and official leaks that the White House was considering cruise missile strikes on Syrian military airstrips, the Russian defence ministry warned that Russia had deployed advanced S-300 and S-400 ground-to-air missiles in Syria. Any US bombing raids would be deemed threatening to Russian military personnel, who would respond accordingly. Moscow also <a href=\"http://uatoday.tv/news/russia-builds-up-forces-in-syria-reuters-782194.html\" title=\"http://uatoday.tv/news/russia-builds-up-forces-in-syria-reuters-782194.html\">doubled supplies to the Assad</a> regime\u2019s war effort.</p> <p>Almost simultaneously, Putin scrapped a US-Russia agreement to reprocess excess plutonium to prevent its use in nuclear weapons and two other nuclear cooperation agreements. The deployment of short-range, nuclear-capable Iskander-M missiles in Kaliningrad, the Russian enclave in eastern Europe bordering Nato members Poland and Lithuania, was confirmed. And, not coincidentally perhaps, massive civil defence exercises were held inside Russia, in apparent preparation for a nuclear war.</p> <p>Just in case Washington had not understood how serious Russia was, officials also declared Putin was considering reopening military bases in Cuba and Vietnam. It is hard to think of a more defiant, taunting message to the Obama administration than conjuring the spectre of a new Cuban missile crisis.</p> <p>Demonstrating that Moscow has other strategic partnerships that could be turned against Washington, Russian ships joined military exercises with China around the disputed South China Sea islands. It is also busily building up alliances with emerging powers such as South Africa and India, notably at this weekend\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.firstpost.com/business/brics-summit-in-goa-from-defence-to-food-deals-india-and-russia-push-ahead-to-reshape-trade-ties-3050782.html\" title=\"http://www.firstpost.com/business/brics-summit-in-goa-from-defence-to-food-deals-india-and-russia-push-ahead-to-reshape-trade-ties-3050782.html\">Brics summit in Goa</a>, while courting traditional American allies such as Turkey and the Philippines.</p> <p>Sergei Lavrov, Putin\u2019s veteran foreign minister, was blunt. Russia would not be told what to do. Like it or not, it was once again a global force to be reckoned with. \u201c<a href=\"http://www.mid.ru/en/foreign_policy/news/-/asset_publisher/cKNonkJE02Bw/content/id/2485001\" title=\"\">Washington... cannot use the language of force, sanctions and ultimatums</a> with Russia while continuing to selectively cooperate with our country only when it benefits the US,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Last week, Putin himself took to the airwaves to deliver a similar message. Responding to a formal accusation by the US government that Moscow had launched a cyber warfare-style campaign to \u201cinterfere with the US election process\u201d, <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-idUSKCN12C27H\" title=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-idUSKCN12C27H\">Putin denied</a> he was trying to help the Republican presidential candidate, Donald Trump.</p> <p>\u201cThey started this hysteria, saying this [hacking] is in Russia\u2019s interests, but this has nothing to do with Russia\u2019s interests,\u201d Putin said. His government would work with whoever won the election \u201cif, of course, the new US leader wishes to work with our country\u201d.</p> <p>This latter statement was chilling. Putin was plainly saying that Russia, no longer the post-Communist economic and military basket-case it briefly became under his predecessor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/apr/23/russia1\" title=\"\">Boris Yeltsin</a>, does not need or seek American approval or agreement to take action in its own interests in Syria or anywhere else. If Barack Obama or his successor want to do business in future, then Russia must be treated as a global equal, not as an irritant or a spoiler or mere regional actor.</p> <p>Such assertions flatly contradict Washington\u2019s preferred narrative, namely that the west \u201cwon\u201d the cold war and Russia is no longer a great power. Hence, perhaps, American slowness to come to terms with a changed situation. But the grave implications of unravelling US-Russia relations are slowly sinking in across Europe, as always the nervous pig stuck in the middle. The German magazine<em> </em><a href=\"http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/syria-war-became-conflict-between-usa-and-russia-and-iran-a-1115681.html\" title=\"http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/syria-war-became-conflict-between-usa-and-russia-and-iran-a-1115681.html\"><em>Spiegel</em> recently suggested that Syria was the most prominent battlefront</a> in a new global war, more perilous even than the Cold War because the old power structures and rules are no longer in place.</p> <p>Yet any sort of western consensus over what to do about Russia remains elusive. Opinion is divided in Europe, where many countries are dependent on Russian energy supplies. Germany\u2019s Social Democrats, for example, oppose sanctions on Moscow in addition to those imposed after Putin\u2019s 2014 annexation of Crimea. Poland and the Baltic states, threatened by the Kaliningrad deployment and border troop build-ups, demand a more muscular Nato stance. Neutral Finland and Sweden, troubled by Russian air and sea incursions, edge ever closer to the western alliance.</p> <p>The so-called Minsk group is due to make another attempt to advance a Ukraine settlement. But nobody is optimistic; the situation there is steadily deteriorating. Following the bad-tempered <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/11/vladimir-putin-declines-french-offer-of-syria-only-talks-in-paris\" title=\"\">cancellation last week of Putin\u2019s visit to France</a>, EU heads of state are also due to meet on Thursday with Syria-related sanctions against Russia on the agenda. This, too, may prove a non-event.</p> <p>In Britain, meanwhile, as Johnson splutters impotently and contradicts himself over no-fly zones, the Labour party claims against all known facts that there is some kind of equivalence between Russian and US actions in Syria. If opposition fighters vacate Aleppo (handing victory to Assad), <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/12/stop-the-war-coalition-protest-russian-embassy\" title=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/12/stop-the-war-coalition-protest-russian-embassy\">Labour suggests</a>, all will be well. Its script could have been written by the Kremlin.</p> <p>The challenge presented by Russia is one of the biggest facing the next US president. Some analysts say Putin is taking advantage of Obama\u2019s lame duck status to create \u201cfacts on the ground\u201d in Syria. The Russian president is said to anticipate a further deterioration in bilateral relations if Hillary Clinton wins. The two have a history of personal dislike, dating back to Clinton\u2019s time as secretary of state. \u201cShe says she sees in him a cold-blooded, self-enriching KGB agent and a bully; he remembers how she appeared to encourage street protests against him in 2011,\u201d said analyst <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2016-10-11/i-m-an-anti-putin-russian-and-clinton-makes-me-nervous\" title=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2016-10-11/i-m-an-anti-putin-russian-and-clinton-makes-me-nervous\">Leonid Bershidsky</a>. Speaking in August, Clinton described Putin as <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/08/25/hillary-clintons-alt-right-speech-annotated/\" title=\"\">\u201cthe grand godfather of this global brand of extreme nationalism</a>\u201d \u2013 lumping him with Trump, German anti-immigrant xenophobes and hard-right populists such as France\u2019s Marine Le Pen.</p> <p>Assuming Trump loses, a Clinton administration has three possible courses of action. One is to acknowledge Putin has a fair case when he argues that the US, the EU and Nato ignored or trampled on Russia\u2019s interests in the post-Soviet era, accept that Crimea is lost and that Assad stays in power for the time being, and focus in future on pragmatic, one-off \u201ctransactional\u201d deals where interests coincide.</p> <p>A second approach is a longer-term variation on the first, containing Russia wherever possible, maintaining or toughening sanctions, and waiting for the departure of Putin and what some economists say will be Russia\u2019s inevitable economic collapse as its oil and gas runs out and international ostracism, corruption and a declining working-age population take their toll. The plan would be to re-set relations (again) with a post-Putin \u201cnew Russia\u201d.</p> <p>The third possibility, and one that seems most likely at this point given Clinton\u2019s policy positions, is that the US will move on to the front foot and purposefully confront Russia directly, not only in Syria but on a number of other areas, backed up by the possible use of military force.</p> <p>This prospect is fraught with danger, especially since Putin has shown repeatedly that he reacts badly to diktats and threats. When cornered, Putin does not back down. He escalates. He does not have a domestic electorate, critical parliament or independent media scrutiny to worry about. He disdains international opinion and international law. Despite last month\u2019s bust-up, Kerry and Lavrov met again on Saturday to try to agree another Syria ceasefire. But a lasting solution looks as far away as ever. If the past 15 years show anything, it is that Putin, like a marauding Red Army tank, has no reverse gear. Much in the Middle East, Europe and beyond now rides on what an untested Clinton, with an awful lot to prove, decides is the best way forward.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b73adb0e7201111a5beb721979d9c87db20b43f3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b73adb0e7201111a5beb721979d9c87db20b43f3/0_72_4096_2457/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pro-Russian rebel troops withdraw from the front line near Donetsk, Ukraine\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"><br>Pro-Russian rebel troops withdraw from the front line about 50km from Donetsk, Ukraine, as part of the demilitarisation agreement signed in September.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alexander Ermochenko/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>SYRIA</h2> <p>Barack Obama\u2019s decision not to intervene militarily after Bashar al-Assad used chemical weapons left the door open for Russia. By going to the aid of his long-term ally Assad, Putin saw a chance to expand Russian influence in the Middle East at American expense and secure military bases on Syria\u2019s Mediterranean coast. Fighting Islamic State terrorism was a secondary consideration. The US insists Assad must go, but its limited commitment so far means the non-jihadist opposition continues to struggle while civilians bear the brunt of the violence.</p> <h2>UKRAINE</h2> <p>Despite the US-orchestrated imposition of international sanctions on Russia, Putin shows no sign of reversing his 2014 annexation of Crimea. Moscow\u2019s not-so-secret support for separatists in eastern Ukraine opposing the pro-western government in Kiev continues unabated, with renewed fighting reported last week. Peace efforts led by Germany in the so-called Minsk group have stalled. Given the US believes it is upholding an important principle of international law, a future Clinton administration is unlikely to recognise Russian-made \u201cfacts on</p> <p>the ground\u201d.</p> <h2>THE BALTIC FRONT<br><br></h2> <p>The deployment of Russian nuclear-capable missiles in Kaliningrad, the isolated enclave it controls on Poland\u2019s and Lithuania\u2019s border, is the latest move in a war of nerves along Europe\u2019s eastern flank. The Baltic sea has also become a contested area as Russian submarines and aircraft test western reactions. Nato has beefed up its defences, and Britain has pledged its support. But the uncomfortable question remains: would an American president</p> <p>go to war to defend Estonia?</p> <h2>CYBER <br>WARFARE<br></h2> <p>The US has formally accused Russia of launching a hacking campaign to disrupt the American presidential electoral process. The suspicion is that Putin, who has been praised by Donald Trump, wants Hillary Clinton defeated and the credibility of the election result put in doubt. Trump has already claimed the poll is fixed against him. Putin denies involvement. But the affair resembles previous cyber attacks on countries that were blamed on government-backed Russian hackers.</p> <h2>THE UNITED NATIONS<br></h2> <p>The US and Putin\u2019s Russia have clashed repeatedly in the UN Security Council, most recently over Moscow\u2019s veto of a resolution demanding an immediate halt to the bombing of Aleppo. The standoff has raised wider concerns about the effectiveness of the UN system when permanent members appear permanently at odds and its aid convoys are blown up. Russia is accused by the US of ignoring international law and of possible war crimes, and there are moves to refer it to the International Criminal Court.</p>",

He has topped the Premiership table in the past two seasons, with 16 and 13, and his tally of four this campaign is bettered only by Saracens\u2019 Jamie George.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/dec/12/exeter-chiefs-clermont-auvergne-european-rugby-champions-cup-match-report\">Thomas Waldrom leads Exeter to bonus point win over Clermont Auvergne</a> </p> </aside>  <p>When the Top 14 leaders, Clermont Auvergne, arrive at Sandy Park on Sunday evening, they will be only too aware of the threat posed by Waldrom who scored two tries in the Champions Cup group match <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/dec/12/exeter-chiefs-clermont-auvergne-european-rugby-champions-cup-match-report\">between the sides in Exeter last December</a>. He helped the Chiefs secure a winning bonus point, a feat they have achieved in their last seven home matches in Europe, the first four in the Challenge Cup.</p> <p>\u201cOne of the best decisions I have ever made was to join Exeter,\u201d he says. \u201cThat is no disrespect to Leicester, but I knew where the club here was heading and wanted to be a part of it. I have another season to go on my contract and then I will see where we are going.\u201d</p> <p>Waldrom has maintained his scoring exploits this season despite a change in the maul law. It has helped hookers, including Exeter\u2019s Luke Cowan-Dickie, who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/17/exeter-harlequins-premiership-match-report\">scored a hat-trick against Harlequins</a> last month, but Waldrom remains one of the hardest players in the Premiership to stop when he nears the line. \u201cThe new maul law has changed my role a bit because the ball is now passed back, but what has not altered is that you still have to get the ball over the line,\u201d he says.</p> <p>\u201cWe have played well in patches this season, but there is a lot more to come from us. It is important to make a good start in the Champions Cup and you have to enjoy matches in the tournament.\u201d</p> <p>Waldrom has scored 46 tries in 128 Premiership appearances, 25 as a replacement. That is a notable return for a forward, but his 33 league tries for the Chiefs have come in 50 matches, four from the bench, and overall he has touched down 40 times for Exeter in 59 outings. There is no prospect, though, of him adding to his four England caps, having been overlooked by Eddie Jones.</p> <p>\u201cYou have to perform well for your club first otherwise you are not going to get in the mix,\u201d he says. \u201cEddie has talked to me and he has other options. You never want to rule it out, but he has a direction he wants to go in. It is quite nice being able to concentrate on Exeter and do what I can to get us as far as possible in the Premiership and Europe.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2016/oct/15/sam-burgess-return-rugby-league-south-sydney-england-rugby-union\">Sam Burgess flourishes on return to rugby league fold at South Sydney | Aaron Bower</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Chiefs are in the form group of the five with Clermont and Ulster, next Saturday\u2019s opponents in Belfast, both topping their leagues while the fourth team, Bordeaux-B\u00e8gles, are in the play-off positions in the Top 14. Exeter, fifth in the Premiership, have been the slowest starters this season with two victories in their six matches.</p> <p>\u201cHaving made <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/28/saracens-exeter-premiership-play-off-final-match-report\">last season\u2019s Premiership final</a>, we cannot pitch ourselves as underdogs any more,\u201d says Waldrom. \u201cWe have made significant progress in the last few seasons and we are a good team. We have let ourselves down in a couple of games, not reacting quickly enough when there have been momentum shifts, but we are not a million miles away. We have to concentrate on what we do well, starting with Clermont.</p> <p>\u201cWe played them and Bordeaux-B\u00e8gles in last season\u2019s Champions Cup and having them again is good in one sense because you know how they play. The lesson we need to take from a year ago is that we need to do better on the road. We got one point from our three away games and that very nearly cost us a place in the quarter-finals.</p> <p>\u201cThe first two matches will be massive for us with Clermont and Ulster both making strong starts to the season. You want to measure yourself against the best around. That is the whole point of the Champions Cup and the key to winning our pool will be picking up points on the road.\u201d</p>",

At least one Trump supporter at a rally in Cincinnati on Friday was <a href=\"http://www.bostonglobe.com/news/politics/2016/10/15/donald-trump-warnings-conspiracy-rig-election-are-stoking-anger-among-his-followers/LcCY6e0QOcfH8VdeK9UdsM/story.html?event=event25\">quoted by the Boston Globe</a> as saying that if Clinton is elected, \u201cI hope we can start a coup.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to have a revolution and take them out of office, if that\u2019s what it takes,\u201d the supporter said.</p> <p>At a rally for Republican vice-presidential candidate Mike Pence <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/card/pence-revolution-rally-goer-dont-say-n664776\">on Thursday</a>, a woman from the audience told the candidate she, too, would rather take action than allow a Democrat to win. \u201cI don\u2019t want this to happen \u2013 but I will tell you for me, personally, if Hillary Clinton gets in,\u201d she warned, \u201cI\u2019m ready for a revolution because we can\u2019t have her in.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want \u2013 don\u2019t say that,\u201d Pence replied. </p> <p>Noting a history of violence at Trump rallies by his supporters, some online observers took Clarke\u2019s call for \u201cpitchforks and torches\u201d seriously, asking whether he was inciting violence and whether his comments constituted sedition against the government. His remarks also raised concerns that it was inappropriate for a law enforcement official famous for his \u201claw and order\u201d political views to be calling for citizens to take to the streets.</p> <p>Robert Post, a first amendment expert and the dean of Yale Law School, said Clarke\u2019s comments were \u201chorrible and despicable\u201d but that \u201can American court would view this as venting, basically.\u201d</p> <p>In 1969, the supreme court overturned a Ku Klux Klan leader\u2019s conviction for inciting violence.</p> <p>The Brandenburg case set a high bar: \u201cIt says that you must intentionally be inciting imminent violence, and it has to be likely that there\u2019s going to be violence.\u201d</p> <p>Clarke\u2019s tweet \u201cwould fall far short of that test\u201d, Post said. </p> <p>Eugene Volokh, a Libertarian second amendment scholar at the University of California Los Angeles school of law, said Clarke\u2019s remarks were clearly intended to be figurative. </p> <p>\u201cWhat do you think Sheriff Clarke is trying to get people to do? Is he trying to get them to spear someone with a pitchfork and burn down their house, or is he trying to motivate someone to vote for Trump or support conservative values? It seems to be quite clearly the latter,\u201d he said. </p> <p>When it came to hyperbolic rhetoric about violence, Volokh said, people were more likely to give people with like-minded politics the benefit of the doubt, and to take their political opponents literally. Those who were taking Clarke\u2019s pitchfork remarks seriously were \u201ctaking it seriously because they don\u2019t like the guy who\u2019s saying it,\u201d Volokh said. </p> <p>Incitement of violence is defined very narrowly under the law, leaving wide freedom of speech protections to talk about violence or revolution in hyperbolic or unspecific ways. <br></p> <p>\u201cIt has to be a situation where you\u2019re talking to a crowd and you\u2019re trying to get them to do something right now,\u201d Volokh said. </p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think anyone looking at this would say, Wow, he\u2019s really asking me to show up with pitchfork and torches outside of the newspaper and burn it down. I don\u2019t think anyone would interpret it that way, especially in light of the photo.\u201d </p> <p>Clarke has built a national platform for himself as a police official with extremely conservative, tough-on-crime views. He is a television commentator, has his own podcast, and is a prominent National Rifle Association speaker. In July, he <a href=\"http://thehill.com/blogs/pundits-blog/civil-rights/sheriff-david%20clarke-black-lives-matter-baton-rouge-civil-war\">compared the Black Lives Matter and Occupy Wall Street</a> movements to the terror group Isis.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/12/black-lives-matter-donald-trump-st-louis-protesters-conversation\">Trump supporters v Black Lives Matter: watching a real conversation unfold</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cAmericans watching the news of the murders of police officers in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, are observing a civil war unfold within our borders. A war between rule of law and anarchy-seeking hate,\u201d he <a href=\"http://thehill.com/blogs/pundits-blog/civil-rights/sheriff-david%20clarke-black-lives-matter-baton-rouge-civil-war\">wrote</a>. </p> <p>\u201cThe murders in Baton Rouge, and before them Dallas, were not acts of domestic terrorism but guerrilla urban warfare against the police \u2013 who represent law and order \u2013 against the constitution, and against the American way.\u201d </p> <p>In August, Clarke called for the National Guard to be sent to Milwaukee in response to unrest after police shot a 23-year-old black man, even though the local police department and mayor said this was unnecessary. </p> <p>\u201cPeople have to find a more socially acceptable way to deal with their frustration, their anger and resentment.

  "<p> Roger Hammond, the former one-day Classic specialist who is Mark Cavendish\u2019s directeur sportif at the Dimension Data squad, is confident that his protege will prove hard to beat in Sunday\u2019s world road race championship in Doha where the Manxman is chasing the second world road title of his career following his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/sep/25/mark-cavendish-road-race-championships\" title=\"\">victory in Copenhagen in 2011</a>.</p> <p>\u201cThe beauty of Sunday, what\u2019s difficult to predict, is that you have to ask how he can lose it,\u201d said Hammond, who finished third in the Paris-Roubaix Classic in 2004. \u201cIf you control it as a team, you end up in a one on one with your sprinter and Cav in the finale. If there are cross-winds, well, winning the overall twice in the Tour of Qatar\u201d \u2013 Cavendish <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/feb/12/mark-cavendish-wins-tour-qatar\" title=\"\">took the race this year</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/feb/08/mark-cavendish-wins-tour-qatar\" title=\"\">in 2013</a> \u2013 \u201cmeans you are scintillating at riding in those conditions because you are in the yellow jersey and people are trying to get rid of you.</p> <p>\u201cSo it\u2019s very difficult to get rid of him as long as he\u2019s fit, meaning the only thing [his rivals] can do is make it so hard that you isolate him. The problem with that is that not many riders are good at that and you risk isolating yourself, which means you end up with the status quo.\u201d In other words, if a team attempts to toughen up the race and cannot leave Cavendish behind, there is a good chance that another sprinter, such as Andr\u00e9 Greipel or the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/sep/27/peter-sagan-mens-road-race-world-championships\" title=\"\">defending champion, Peter Sagan</a>, might simply have to tackle Cavendish man to man.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/sep/25/mark-cavendish-road-race-championships\">Mark Cavendish's world championships road race win puts Britain on top | Richard Williams</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Cavendish enjoyed a smooth build-up through September until stomach problems mean he missed six days of training at the end of the month, and pulled out of two races. He did, however, finish strongly in the Paris-Tours Classic last Sunday, implying that he is not far from his best.</p> <p>\u201cWithout that sickness you\u2019d be a fool to bet against him [for the World\u2019s] but now we don\u2019t know,\u201d said Hammond. \u201cParis-Tours was a good sign, people underestimate that race but he rode 250 kilometres and was at the front after a hard run-in.\u201d</p> <p>Hammond joined the Dimension Data team this year and oversaw Cavendish\u2019s successful campaign in the Tour de France, where <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jul/16/mark-cavendish-four-timer-30-tour-de-france-stage-wins\" title=\"\">he won four stages</a>. He added that the rider\u2019s form in mid-September at the Tour of Britain had been outstanding. \u201cHe was bloody strong there. We had to use him in a different way because Steve Cummings was in the yellow jersey, so everyone overlooked him. He saved the day for us several times.\u201d</p> <p>Cavendish was prominent in setting up Cummings, who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/11/steve-cummings-tour-of-britain-biggest-win\" title=\"\">went on to win overall</a>, for what proved to be the key climb, the Struggle in the Lake District, but, said Hammond, there was more. \u201cThe most impressive thing was on the days when the other riders were attacking left, right and centre at the start, on several days Cav was our last man standing after doing 500 sprints to control all the breaks.\u201d</p> <p>Sunday\u2019s world championships course consists of a 150km loop to the north of Doha where the race is likely to be buffeted by the wind, before seven laps of the 15km finishing circuit on the Pearl peninsula, where a plethora of roundabouts and corners makes for a race that is technically demanding but completely flat. There have been issues with riders collapsing in the heat \u2013 Great Britain\u2019s Luke Rowe tweeted a picture of his handlebar computer displaying a temperature of 47.9C \u2013 and the extreme conditions are likely to play a central role.</p> <p>Depending on how they cope with the heat, Great Britain field a team which, on paper, is at least as strong as the one which dominated in 2011. As well as the Team Sky stalwarts Ian Stannard, Geraint Thomas and Rowe \u2013 who protected Chris Froome when strong winds hit the Tour de France this summer \u2013 sprinters such as Ben Swift, Dan McLay and Adam Blythe could provide strong support in a blanket finish.</p>",
  "<p>A powerful cross-party group of MPs is to renew pressure on ministers over Brexit by forcing a parliamentary vote on whether they should reveal their plans for the UK\u2019s future outside the EU before negotiations begin. In a further sign that cross-party alliances are forming in favour of a soft Brexit, former party leaders Ed Miliband and Nick Clegg will join forces with the shadow Brexit minister, Keir Starmer, and the former Tory minister Nick Herbert to demand a Commons debate this week.</p> <p>The motion they will table will call on the government to release a substantive outline of its plan \u2013 including its broad intention for the UK\u2019s future relationship with the single market \u2013 and ensure that parliament can amend its contents before exit talks start early next year. </p> <p> The move is aimed at preventing a hard Brexit, under which the UK would retain no ties with the EU\u2019s single market, and ensuring that MPs are not sidelined in the plans for exiting the EU.</p> <p>A new poll exclusively revealed to the Observer shows a clear majority of the British public supporting continued membership of the single market, despite the narrow 23 June vote to leave the EU. Of those surveyed in a poll commissioned by Open Britain, the successor to Britain Stronger in Europe, 59% of people wanted to stay in the single market, while 41% wanted to leave.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/15/nicola-sturgeon-vows-to-hold-second-scottish-vote-in-event-of-hard-brexit\">Sturgeon vows Scottish independence vote in event of hard Brexit</a> </p> </aside>  <p>At the recent Tory party conference, Conservative ministers suggested that the UK would be taken out of the single market if that was the only way they would be able to win back control of the UK\u2019s borders and control immigration.</p> <p>While the survey shows remain voters overwhelmingly support staying in the single market, leave voters are divided, with 45% believing the UK should leave the single market, 28% saying it should stay in, and 26% not sure. </p> <p>Alarmingly for ministers leading the push for hard Brexit, a majority of all voters believe such an approach would leave Britain worse off. Of them, 58% say leaving the single market would have a negative impact on the economy, while 32% believe the country would fare better outside the single market and 12% do not think leaving would make any difference. </p> <p> Pressing the government to allow a vote in parliament on its intentions, Starmer said: \u201cThe government has now finally conceded that there needs to be proper scrutiny of its plans for Brexit. That is a real victory for parliament. Now it needs to take the next step and guarantee the House of Commons will have a chance to vote on the basic terms of Brexit before article 50 is invoked. Anything less would be sidelining parliament on the defining issue facing Britain.\u201d</p> <p> Clegg, speaking on behalf of the Open Britain campaign, said: \u201cThe government should not take decisions that will have massive consequences, like leaving the single market, without seeking parliament\u2019s approval. David Davis [the Brexit secretary] previously advocated a pre-negotiating white paper and has always championed parliamentary sovereignty. The government must now respect that by committing to a debate and a vote in parliament on its negotiating position.\u201d</p> <p> Former police minister Herbert added that the cross-party group was not seeking to \u201cdelay or frustrate the referendum decision\u201d, but wanted to prevent \u201chard Brexit ideologues\u201d from damaging the country by pulling out of the single market without proper scrutiny. </p> <p> A majority of Conservative, Labour and Liberal Democrat voters support continued membership of the single market, with only Ukip supporters backing the alternative, suggesting that Theresa May\u2019s calls for a hard Brexit have yet to resonate with voters. </p>",

After all their problems at the London Stadium, West Ham might be quietly glad of an away game. But they won\u2019t find much goodwill at Selhurst Park, where Crystal Palace would derive considerable pleasure from keeping their London rivals in the relegation places. </p> <p>Palace are in terrific form, unbeaten in five after losing their first two league games, while West Ham have been fifty shades of shambles for most of the season. They will hope that Dimitri Payet\u2019s amazing goal two weeks ago, which gave them a point against Middlesbrough, is a turning point in their season. If they keep losing, however, it won\u2019t be long before somebody utters the phrase that has chilled West Ham fans since 2002-03: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2002%E2%80%9303_West_Ham_United_F.C._season\">that they are too good to go down</a>.</p> <p><strong>Kick off</strong> is at 5.30pm.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-10-15T15:39:25.852Z\">at 4.39pm BST</time></p>  </div>",
  "<p>The far left\u2019s ideology is not \u201cleftwing\u201d in any sense that a socialist from the 19th or 20th centuries would have understood. It is simply opposition to the west whatever the west does. Occidentalism explains the appearances of Labour\u2019s leaders on Iran\u2019s propaganda <a href=\"http://uk.businessinsider.com/jeremy-corbyn-paid-iran-press-tv-tortured-journalist-2016-6\" title=\"\">channels</a> , the endorsements of <a href=\"https://leftfootforward.org/2015/03/projecting-the-kremlin-line/\" title=\"\">Russian imperialism</a>, and the silence that greets the Syrian massacres.</p> <p>There is no secret about the nihilism and double standards. Both have been obvious to me at any rate since the bulk of the left failed to show solidarity with the victims of Saddam Hussein in the Iraq war of <a href=\"http://www.workersliberty.org/node/3569\" title=\"\">2003</a> . Nor does the far left, if we can call it a left, try to hide its prejudices. When asked why the streets of London were not heaving with demonstrators protesting against Russia turning Aleppo into the Guernica of our times, Stop the War replied that it had no wish to add to the \u201cjingoism\u201d politicians were whipping up against <a href=\"https://sputniknews.com/europe/201610121046260722-stop-the-war-johnson/\" title=\"\">plucky little Russia</a>. The left\u2019s task was \u201cto oppose the west\u201d. That was all.</p> <p>I have criticised the hollowed-out leftism of the 21st century many times, and could fulminate about how no one has yet provided a satisfactory answer to the question: why is it \u201cleftwing\u201d to&#xa0;support the gangster-capitalist Russian state?</p> <p>I could note that the mainstream media has not realised that British Islam is overwhelmingly Sunni, but its supposed defenders on the \u201cleft\u201d are now allied with Putin, Assad and the Iranian and Hezbollah death squads \u2013 the Shia side in the Sunni/Shia religious war, in other words.</p> <p>But let me be generous instead. Jeremy Corbyn does not often give me the chance to defend him, and it is therefore all the more of a pleasure to redress the imbalance today. When his supporters say he is consistent, they are telling the truth. His illiberal worldview is entirely coherent. The trouble is, it is wholly despicable, and provokes the troubling question whether it is so different from the worldview of the west\u2019s \u201crespectable\u201d leaders.</p> <p>There have been repeated opportunities for Barack Obama to take a lead on Syria. The Syrian revolution was political, rather than sectarian, in its initial stages, but he looked away. He might have responded when Assad imitated Saddam and used chemical weapons against civilians, or raised the conscience of the world when Islamic state engaged in the industrial-scale rape of <a href=\"http://www.apa.org/monitor/2016/09/yazidi-survivors.aspx\" title=\"\">Yazidi women</a>.</p> <p>As it was, the practical effect of Nato policy has been to give Russia a free pass, as Corbyn does.</p> <p>Suppose western leaders called Russia\u2019s bluff and insisted on a no-fly zone over Aleppo and a safe haven in northern Syria for refugees. I think you can imagine the reaction. I am very uncomfortable with the term \u201cfar left\u201d for many reasons, not the smallest being that Corbynism is not an alien ideology that appeared from the fringe, but a grotesque version of the worst prejudices of polite society.</p> <p>In the last decade, mainstream liberals were just as likely as post-socialist tyrannophiles to tell you that the west was the source of the world\u2019s ills. Those who disagreed were browbeaten with accusations that they were neo-cons, Zionists, warmongers, supporters of torture in Abu Ghraib and so on. Propaganda techniques allowed the mainstream to assure itself that criticism of its orthodoxies was driven by the lowest of motives; a myopic certainty that stopped it seeing sinister movements in the British left that were in front of its nose, let alone sinister movements in the rest of the world. People complaining about Stop the War failing to organise demonstrations against Russia should ask why Amnesty International and other liberal organisations don\u2019t mount them instead. Obama and European leaders must have known that, after Iraq, opposition to intervention in Syria would have come from all quarters: from the far left, from liberal opinion, and from a right wing that is increasingly nationalist and isolationist.</p> <p>The sympathy shown for Putin by Corbyn and Jill Stein, the American Greens\u2019 presidential candidate, is all the more shameful because Donald Trump is an admirer of Putin, as is Marine le Pen\u2019s National Front and the leaders of Europe\u2019s other far-right parties. The very people Corbyn and Stein condemn at home for their racism, they tacitly endorse abroad. As I said earlier, there is an \u201cL\u201d-shaped hole where the left should be. But in terms of practical politics it is clear that whatever label people slap on themselves, their similarities are more striking than their differences.</p> <p>From the president of the United States, via the liberal left and nationalist right, to you and me, are we all Jeremy Corbyn now?

It may well be that in Scotland it is the one that resonates too.</p> </blockquote>  <p>Hello, Andrew. Firstly, thanks very much for your coverage. I think we've now hit a point where the reactions need to be divided into 'domestic' and 'UK' reactions. In Scotland, the speech on Thursday was just a clear statement of what we already knew: there was a bit more detail but no change in Scottish govt policy since the morning after the Brexit vote. But in London you haven't been following that debate, so it was big news to you. </p> <p>For Scottish people the use of the word 'home rule' today was an intriguing straw in the wind, to me at least way more interesting than Thursday's announcements. That's parking the SNP's tanks on Labour's lawn and claiming to be the heirs of devolution, while merging the notions of indy /FFA / devolution. And for us, hospitals and the care system aren't boring compared to the indy/not-indy debate: it's what governments (and nations) are <i>for</i>. The chance to pursue more inclusive, i.e. non-Tory, policies is the reason why people actually want independence or home rule in the first place.</p></div> </div> </div>  </figure>  <p>FFA is full fiscal autonomy.</p> <p>There were two references to home rule in the speech. This one:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Of course, I know there is still much to do.</p> <p>Much to do in the next phase of Scotland\u2019s home rule journey.</p> </blockquote> <p>And this one.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Our home rule journey has given us new confidence. </p> </blockquote> <p>That is all from me for tonight.</p> <p>Thanks for your comments.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58025ac8e4b047a4eaafcd3b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-15T17:05:56.906Z\">6.05pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Gavin Kelly,</strong> chief executive of the Resolution Trust and a deputy chief of staff to Gordon Brown in Downing Street, also thinks Nicola Sturgeon has discovered her inner Blairite.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/GavinJKelly1/status/787326708194082816\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Choice &amp; flexibility in childcare.

It may well be that in Scotland it is the one that resonates most too.</p> <p>After more than nine years in office in Scotland it is getting harder (although by no means impossible, given the limits on the Scottish parliament\u2019s power) for the SNP to explain away poor public services, and there was evidence of that today, in Derek Mackay\u2019s Today interview (see<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/oct/15/snp-conference-nicola-sturgeon-speech-scots-cant-trust-boris-johnson-and-liam-fox-to-represent-them-says-sturgeon-politics-live?page=with:block-5801f112e4b0160123895fd9#block-5801f112e4b0160123895fd9\"> 10.42am)</a> and the reception John Swinney got at an education fringe (see<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/oct/15/snp-conference-nicola-sturgeon-speech-scots-cant-trust-boris-johnson-and-liam-fox-to-represent-them-says-sturgeon-politics-live?page=with:block-58022583e4b047a4eaafcc3c#block-58022583e4b047a4eaafcc3c\"> 1.50pm)</a>. And you could detect some evidence of this too in Sturgeon\u2019s speech, which was notably free of boasting. Instead it was pragmatic and workmanlike (and probably all the better for that).</p> <p>At the heart of the speech was a series of solid, but mainstream and detail-light policies. The best passage came when Sturgeon was talking about failings in the care service, and the need for children to be loved. (\u2018My view is simple: every young person deserves to be loved.\u201d) She tied this in well with her theme of \u201cinclusion\u201d, although a lot of her comments on children in care could have come straight from a speech by David Cameron on life chances. The announcement on NHS funding raised the question of what hospital units might have be to be cut as part of this reconfiguration. And, for someone from England, the announcement on childcare was interesting because of the tacit admission that choice at present is not a strong feature of Scottish childcare provision. Championing choice as she did sounded a bit Blairite, although of course Sturgeon would be horrified if anyone saw it like that.</p> <p>Here are the main points from the speech.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Sturgeon announced plans to extend the small business bonus, so that from April an extra 100,000 business premises do not pay business rates.</strong> (See <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/oct/15/snp-conference-nicola-sturgeon-speech-scots-cant-trust-boris-johnson-and-liam-fox-to-represent-them-says-sturgeon-politics-live?page=with:block-58023f28e4b01ffb8ffcbf52#block-58023f28e4b01ffb8ffcbf52\">3.38pm.)</a></li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>She announced a reform of the way childcare services are provided, with an emphasis on giving parents more choice.</strong> (See <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/oct/15/snp-conference-nicola-sturgeon-speech-scots-cant-trust-boris-johnson-and-liam-fox-to-represent-them-says-sturgeon-politics-live?page=with:block-5802402de4b047a4eaafccbf#block-5802402de4b047a4eaafccbf\">3.43pm.)</a></li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>She announced an independent and far-reaching review of the care system.</strong> (See <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/oct/15/snp-conference-nicola-sturgeon-speech-scots-cant-trust-boris-johnson-and-liam-fox-to-represent-them-says-sturgeon-politics-live?page=with:block-5802418de4b047a4eaafccc8#block-5802418de4b047a4eaafccc8\">3.49pm.)</a></li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>She announced an extra \u00a3500m for primary care by 2021.</strong> This will happen because the proportion of health spending going on primary care will be increased, up to 11%.

He thinks it\u2019s a flawed idea. Here\u2019s an excerpt.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>First of all, the taxation burden referred to in the motion is a matter for local authorities, not individual schools, with councils paying business rates on all schools under their control. Charitable status would therefore represent a significant saving for local authorities which could certainly free up more money for education spending. So far so good.</p> <p>The trouble is that business rates are paid to the Scottish Government which also provides the vast majority of councils\u2019 cash. Charitable status for around 100 private schools costs the Scottish government about \u00a310m a year, so imagine the figure for 2500 state schools.</p> <p>If the government could promise not to claw back this money by reducing education funding then that would be one thing, but the money will surely have to come from somewhere.</p> <p>Furthermore, if the government is indeed willing to finance a significant increase in education spending \u2014 such as would be achieved by non-domestic rates exemptions \u2014 then why not simply hand over the money right now?</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58022748e4b047a4eaafcc40\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-15T13:02:28.480Z\">2.02pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here is more on the debate earlier on the vote to give charitable status to state schools in Scotland.

By educating their children at private schools they benefit from about \u00a390m of tax breaks annually. </p> <p>Effectively we have a situation just now where the state subsidises educational segregation and class privilege. The system as it stands also perpetuates educational inequality and that has a knock on effect on child poverty.</p> </blockquote> <p>He highlighted the case of Fettes College, where fees are around \u00a324,000 a year, which he said benefited from an 80% reduction in non-domestic rates while providing bursaries for 2% of pupils. </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The system at the moment means that elitist private schools which serve the rich, the privileged and those that are already advantaged in life\u2019s race enjoy charitable status while state schools serving the wider population, which undoubtedly provide a public benefit, do not. </p> <p>It is time for state schools to be treated equally with private schools. It is time for our hard-pressed state schools to have this glaring anomaly removed, it\u2019s time for a level playing field for Scotland\u2019s children.</p> </blockquote> <p>Several delegates said it would be better just to remove charitable status from schools. One of them, <strong>Peter Henderson</strong>, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We\u2019re going about this the wrong way round. Remove charitable status for private schools to level the playing field. It\u2019s as simple as that.</p> </blockquote> <p>But Sutherland revealed that his branch of Newington and Southside had twice put forward a draft resolution calling for the removal of charitable status for private schools but it had not got through the SNP\u2019s standing orders and agenda committee. </p> <p>Sutherland also said the Scottish government has rejected removing charitable status from private schools. He said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>A couple of years ago a young lady through the petitions mechanisms through the Scottish parliament lobbied the Scottish government and the Scottish parliament to have charitable status removed. </p> <p>It was rejected because our Scottish government said there was insufficient evidence for a review of the charitable legislation relating to private schools.

But that is an almighty if. Britain\u2019s leading psephologist, <a href=\"http://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/politics/boundary-changes-which-mps-stand-to-lose-their-seats\">John Curtice</a>, kicked off the discussion [at a Prospect fringe at the conference] by summarising the polling on independence since the Brexit vote, which many nationalists had hoped would steel Scots\u2014who voted to stay in Europe, and now face being dragged out by English votes\u2014to make the split with the UK that they had ducked from making two years ago. Curtice, however, had dispiriting news. Few Scots, he said, cared all that much about Europe, and in fact a significant chunk of SNP voters had actually voted \u201cLeave.\u201d Yes, some people\u2014perhaps one in 10 of all \u201cNo\u201d voters in 2014\u2014were now more inclined to vote for independence next time around, but a rather similarly-sized proportion of 2014 \u201cYes\u201d voters had gone the other way. Either they preferred to be part of a Britain that was out of the EU, or they were increasingly nervous about the economics in the uncertain post-Brexit environment. Put it all together, and Scotland has barely swung at all.</p> <p>The SNP MP Kirsty Blackman was frank in admitting that here the party faces phenomenal challenges with the sequencing of the referendum, in particular. If it rushed now\u2014to exploit the full shock of the Brexit vote moment and the cross-border division that it revealed\u2014London would be able to pretend that it would deliver all sorts of things from its negotiations with the EU. It might be impossible to secure both border control and single market access at the same time, but London could\u2014for the moment\u2014continue to bluff its way through and insist that it can have the best of all possible worlds, spinning its way through Indyref2 just as the Leavers did in the Brexit campaign. But if Scotland waits until the UK truly knows where it stands before deciding its future, then the UK will actually be out. The SNP would then have to explain how it would negotiate an independent Scotland\u2019s place back in Europe, and would\u2014without special treatment\u2014have to accept both the euro and membership of the Schengen passport-free zone. All of which would greatly complicate the \u201cYes\u201d side\u2019s pitch.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><a href=\"http://www.itv.com/news/border/2016-10-14/nicola-sturgeon-marches-her-snp-troops-towards-the-top-of-the-indyref2-hill/\"><strong>Peter MacMahon, the ITV Border political editor, assesses on his blog the chances of Nicola Sturgeon pushing ahead with her second independence referendum threat.</strong></a></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>If the UK government makes an offer to the Scottish government, who will judge whether this is enough to protect Scotland\u2019s interest.</p> <p>It looks like the final arbiter of that will be the First Minister.

Here are extracts from her speech.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>My name is Laura and I have been living with multiple sclerosis for nine years. And the fact that I am standing here conference giving a speech means that I am one of the lucky ones. </p> <p>It has become clear to me that many people living with MS have been using cannabis to help with the symptoms of that condition. In fact, it\u2019s one of the worst kept secrets at the hospital. All of these people risk a criminal record, unlike in Australia, Chile, Canada, Finland, France, Germany, Romania and some US states.</p> <p>We as a developed Western nation are fast becoming behind the times. </p> <p>In fact, a report publishd on 13 September this year by a cross-party group of MPs and peers has called on the government to introduce a system giving patients access to cannabis for medical reasons and to decriminalise the growing of small amounts at home for the same purposes.</p> <p>However the law as it stands in the UK means that cannabis is a class b drug, and the current penalty for possession is up to five years in prison, an unlimited fine, or both, and for supply and production up to 14 years in prison, an unlimited fine, or both.</p> <p>Now, I don\u2019t think someone in pain should be criminalised for trying to ease that pain. </p> </blockquote> <p>Brennan-Whitefield said that MS sufferers could now get a drug called Sativex which contains cannabinoids (cannabis ingredients). But it was not widely available and a private prescription cost \u00a34,250, she said. \u201cDoes that sound fair to you?\u201d she asked.</p> <p>She said she was only proposing to decriminalise cannabis for medical use, and that it was not just MS sufferers who might benefit. Cannabis could help with arthritis, cancer, Chron\u2019s disease, epilepsy, and palliative care, she said.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Given that these people who are suffering pain - and I can assure you, those who are willing to use cannabis have in most cases exhausted every other option - is it not unreasonable to criminalise them? I am talking about some of the most vulnerable people in society who may have had the added misfortune of going through the DWP\u2019s inhumane assessment procedure for disability benefits. To be then branded criminals, for trying to have a quality of life?</p> <p>I know what it is to suffer pain. And, be in no doubt, if it came to it, I would not hesitate to ease that pain in any way I could because that is a natural instinct.</p> <p>But if my condition were to deteriorate to that stage I would be reliant on other people to help me: my friends, my family, and most of all my partner Stephen who I really don\u2019t thank enough for the care that he gives me.</p> <p>A drug conviction has very real consequences, serious consequences for your future prospects and your employment prospects. I think that now is the time to show that we are the party of compassion and common sense and it is now that we should be sending out a message to those people that we hear you and we are not shying away from this issue as Westminster is.</p> </blockquote> <p>Here is Brennan-Whitefield making her speech.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/CLEARUK/status/787250463355863040\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">BRILLIANT work by Laura Brennan-Whitefield <a href=\"https://twitter.com/laurapoppet\">@laurapoppet</a> at SNP Conference <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/SNP16?src=hash\">#SNP16</a> on medicinal <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/cannabis?src=hash\">#cannabis</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/EndOurPain?src=hash\">#EndOurPain</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/rNHKSBTqZw\">pic.twitter.com/rNHKSBTqZw</a></p>&mdash; Cannabis Law Reform (@CLEARUK) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CLEARUK/status/787250463355863040\">October 15, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58020854e4b0160123896045\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-15T10:43:48.850Z\">11.43am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">SNP delegates call for cannabis to be decriminalised for medical use</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Delegates have overwhelmingly backed the resolution saying cannabis should be decriminalised for medical use.</p> <p>This does not mean this will happen in Scotland because this is a matter for the UK government.

  "<p>One of the most notorious Ku Klux Klan groups is stepping up attempts to ignite race war across the US with a call to arms against black people and violent support of the White Lives Matter campaign.</p> <p>An inside account from within the Loyal White Knights of the KKK also reveals that the group is linked to stabbings of anti-fascists, Holocaust denial, threats to attack gay men and extreme anti-Black Lives Matter propaganda.</p> <p>During a 15-month online infiltration of the Klan, British anti-racist group <a href=\"http://www.hopenothate.org.uk\" title=\"\">Hope Not Hate</a> obtained the membership list of what is described as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jul/19/kkk-clashes-south-carolina-racism\" title=\"\">largest KKK faction</a>, a list of 270 individuals including police officers. (The group claims it has 3,000 members.) Most hailed from southern states such as Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia and North Carolina, although there was a considerable cohort from the Midwest, the east coast and California.</p> <p>Among them is a 28-year-old British man from Suffolk who claims to be a member of the Knights Templar, an \u201cinterdenominational association of active Christians\u201d. Another is a 44-year-old Frenchman based in Marseille who recently uploaded a series of anti-Muslim pictures to a secret Klan chatroom.</p> <p>Investigators also obtained a list of members expelled from the Loyal White Knights for so-called violations, ranging from drug use to sleeping with \u201ca Jew whore\u201d or a Mexican, watching Asian porn or having a \u201cmixed child\u201d, which made them a \u201crace traitor\u201d.</p> <p>Based in North Carolina, the Loyal White Knights was founded in 2012 by Chris Barker, a far-right supporter who last year was linked to a plot by a New York white supremacist convicted of conspiring to use a remote-controlled radiation device he called \u201cHiroshima <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/aug/21/white-supremacist-convicted-plot-to-kill-obama-death-ray-device\" title=\"\">on a light switch</a>\u201d to harm Muslims.</p> <p>Barker is a contentious figure among Klansmen, partly because of his connections to neo-Nazis. He recently became part of the <a href=\"https://www.splcenter.org/hatewatch/2016/07/21/meet-aryan-nationalist-alliance-%E2%80%93%E2%80%93-racist-hodgepodge-doomed-fail\" title=\"\">Aryan Nationalist Alliance</a>, an extreme coalition of white nationalist groups, including notorious US organisations such as Matthew Heimbach\u2019s Traditionalist Worker Party.</p> <p>Heimbach , who is dubbed the \u201cface of a new generation of white nationalists\u201d by critics, and has advocated racial segregation \u2013 was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/04/theresa-may-bans-us-segregationist-from-uk-for-neo-nazi-remarks\" title=\"\">banned from entering the UK</a> last year by Theresa May, who was then home secretary.</p> <p>Hope Not Hate\u2019s investigation found considerable evidence that Loyal White Knights retains its desire for extreme racist violence, seeking to exploit the anti-Muslim, anti-immigrant climate fostered by Donald Trump.</p> <p>\u201cOnce inside, we came across some of the worst racism we have ever encountered and learned about their dangerous racist ideology, witnessing a culture which encouraged extreme violence,\u201d said one of the infiltrators.</p> <p>It also found that the Klan is actively involved in \u201cKnight Rides\u201d, where members drive around communities at night and throw white supremacist leaflets on to the lawns of black people\u2019s homes.</p> <p>\u201cThey organise White Lives Matter demonstrations where they get \u2018tooled up\u2019 and also Knight Rides that hark back to when members rode horses through towns at night, to terrify communities,\u201d said an investigator.</p> <p>In February this year, members of Barker\u2019s group held an anti-immigration <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/28/kkk-rally-california-turns-violent-counter-protesters\" title=\"\">demonstration in Anaheim</a>, California, during which they held White Lives Matter signs. The protest erupted into violence, with three people stabbed and 13 others arrested.</p> <p>Barker then emailed the infiltrator and wrote: \u201cWe just had a fight between our members and communist [sic] our members stabbed 3 in California.\u201d Five KKK members were arrested following the brawl but later released as police said they had evidence the KKK members acted in self-defence. Barker, who calls himself the imperial wizard of the Loyal White Knights, claimed his members were holding a peaceful anti-immigration demonstration. \u201cIf we\u2019re attacked, we will attack back,\u201d said Barker, who did not attend the rally.</p> <p>Eventually, Hope Not Hate investigators were invited into the closed sections of the group\u2019s website, where they found members circulating images of themselves posing with firearms or holding a hangman\u2019s noose \u2013 a symbol linked to the lynching of black people \u2013 with one mocked-up picture showing President Obama apparently being hanged. Jokes and memes about hanging and running over black people were also posted.</p> <p>Investigators were sent magazines and leaflets, some of them deeply antisemitic. One image depicted a hooded figure in front of the confederate flag with the words: \u201cHelp save our race; everything we cherish is under assault by ZOG\u201d \u2013 an acronym for zionist occupation government, which is an antisemitic conspiracy theory that claims Jews secretly control world power.</p> <p>During the undercover operation Barker, a Holocaust denier, wrote: \u201cThey said there [sic] goal was to destroy the white race. Here they are doing just that \u2013 by brainwashing our people through the media.\u2019</p> <p>The most extreme leaflet encouraged violence against gay men, with one stating: \u201cStop Aids: support gay bashing,\u201d and \u201cHomosexual men and their sexual acts are disgusting and inhuman.\u201d The same leaflet also espouses racism, adding: \u201cBan non-white immigration. Outlaw Haitians \u2013 deport mud people.\u201d</p> <p>The extremism of the modern Klan movement may appear to be undimmed, but its membership has rapidly declined over recent decades. During the 1920s, the organisation\u2019s four million members were able to stage huge demonstrations in Washington. The <a href=\"https://www.splcenter.org/what-we-do\" title=\"\">Southern Poverty law Centre </a> estimates that there are between 5,000 and 8,000 Klan members active at the moment, split across dozens of groups.</p> <p>In their responses to questioning about the findings of the investigation, Barker and his wife Amanda referred to the Holocaust as a \u201cmoney-making scam\u201d. They added: \u201cOur group does not call for the killing of black people, but we do tell our members to arm and protect themselves.\u201d Barker\u2019s statement also defended the group\u2019s homophobic stance.</p>",
  "<p>Minding wrote the opening lines of Aidan O\u2019Brien\u2019s remarkable season on the British turf when she took the 1,000 Guineas at Newmarket in May and she provided the sign-off as well with a commanding half-length success in the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes here on Saturday, the seventh Group One victory of her 12-race career.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/15/almanzor-beats-found-champion-stakes-ascot-horse-racing\">Almanzor beats Found again to win the Champion Stakes at Ascot</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The favourites for the first three races on the Champions Day card had finished out of the frame, including two from the O\u2019Brien stable, but the punters put their faith in Minding and sent her off as the 7-4 favourite ahead of Ribchester, the Prix Jacques le Marois winner, at 7-2.</p> <p>The money on Minding was as good as banked from a furlong out when Ryan Moore closed on the pace and then moved into the lead, as Ribchester tried, and failed, to do the same. Though the gap between the pair was closing in the final strides, Minding and Moore were always in control.</p> <p>Minding\u2019s first Group One victory was at The Curragh over seven furlongs in the Moyglare Stud Stakes and she moved up in distance to a mile-and-a-half to win the Oaks in June, so another top-flight victory over a mile, in the most prestigious all-aged race at the trip in Europe, underlined the depth and the range of her talent.</p> <p>O\u2019Brien now has 21 Group One victories to his name on the Flat this season, plus another in a Grade One at the Cheltenham Festival, and retains a real chance to equal or overtake Bobby Frankel\u2019s record of 25 in a calendar year. He also finished the day as the first trainer to win \u00a38m in a British season, having already been the first to reach \u00a36m and \u00a37m earlier in the year.</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s an incredible filly,\u201d O\u2019Brien said. \u201cHer usual work rider got off her recently and said she couldn\u2019t believe the piece of work that Minding had just done. She\u2019s a very special filly.</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s won at the top level at a mile, mile-and-a-quarter and a mile\u2011and\u2011a\u2011half and then to bring her down in trip to win an all-aged mile race, they have to be very special.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d imagine that would be it now for her for the rest of the year. The plan was to come here and try and win and maybe the lads will now bring her back to race again next year. They\u2019ll sit down and talk about that now, but hopefully she can race again.\u201d</p> <p>Minding is the first filly to win the QEII since Milligram in 1987 while for Moore this was, surprisingly, a first success for the high-profile jockey on Champions Day. \u201cShe\u2019s had a hard season and to bring her back to a mile is some achievement,\u201d he said. \u201cShe was too good for them, too strong. She has lots of pace and masses of talent.\u201d</p> <p>Ribchester has also run his last race of the season but could yet return as a four-year-old after a solid run into second place.</p> <p>Lightning Spear ran on well into third having raced away from the pace and on the stands side, which seemed to be unfavoured in the Sprint earlier on the card.</p> <p>\u201cHindsight says the far side would have been better but he\u2019s quickened up very, very well and has been beaten by two very good horses,\u201d David Simcock, the trainer of Lightning Spear, said.</p> <p>\u201cHe made up a lot of ground on them and he\u2019ll have his day. I\u2019d love to have him back next year.\u201d</p> <p>Minding\u2019s victory was particularly welcome for O\u2019Brien, who had already seen two strong favourites soundly beaten earlier on the card.</p> <p>First it was Order Of St George, the Gold Cup winner at the Royal meeting here back in June, who failed to reproduce the form of his third place in the Arc two weeks ago and finished only fourth behind Sheikhzayedroad in the Long Distance. Then, in the Champion Fillies &amp; Mares\u2019 Stakes, Seventh Heaven could only stay on into fifth behind Journey, the impressive winner, after finding some trouble in running.</p> <p>Sheikhzayedroad is one of the most durable and consistent horses in training and added another \u00a3200,000 to his prize-money earnings with his 11-1 victory. He does have a Group One victory on his record, in the Northern Dancer Stakes at Woodbine in September 2014, but he is essentially a Group Two performer who never runs a bad race and has now picked up nearly \u00a31m in prize money in his career.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s a pleasure to train, because he trains himself,\u201d David Simcock, Sheikhzayedroad\u2019s trainer, said. \u201cHe really is a diamond. As he\u2019s got a little bit older, he\u2019s got a little bit slower, but he\u2019s got a massive appetite and that little bit of speed he\u2019s got over this [two-mile] trip helps.\u201d</p> <p>Journey improved on her second place in the Fillies &amp; Mares\u2019 Stakes last year to claim her first success at Group One level, beating Speedy Boarding, a Group One winner herself at the recent Arc meeting at Chantilly, by four lengths.</p> <p>\u201cShe picked up like she had roller skates,\u201d Frankie Dettori, Journey\u2019s jockey, said. \u201cI can\u2019t believe the turn of foot that she showed today. She deserved a Group One, she has been running so well.\u201d</p> <p>Tom Queally will never have another afternoon like Champions Day four years ago, when he steered Frankel to a perfect record of 14 wins in his final start in the Champion Stakes. He did manage to record his first win on the card since, however, as The Tin Man finished strongly down the middle of the track to land the Champions Sprint for James Fanshawe.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d probably get more of a buzz out of this than any of the big winners I\u2019ve had, and that includes the Breeders\u2019 Cup [on Midday in 2009],\u201d Queally said. \u201cI was a Group One glutton back then [when Frankel was racing] so I got no kick out of it. Sometimes you need a bit of a drought to make you appreciate things.</p> <p>\u201cThe post-Frankel years have been difficult. But it\u2019s like poker, if you keep going to the table, you\u2019ve got a chance of getting a hand. I was dealt the best hand of all time a few years ago, but I know I am capable of playing a hand if I get it.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>Nicola Sturgeon has insisted that a hard Brexit would amount to the UK government breaking the promises it made during the Scottish referendum, and that such a departure from the EU would lead to another poll on independence.</p> <p>The first minister of Scotland said that in the coming months she would seek \u201cnew powers to help keep Scotland in the single market, even if the UK leaves\u201d, as she gave her keynote speech at the annual SNP conference in Glasgow on Saturday.</p> <p>In defiance of Theresa May\u2019s stated intention to stand in the way of a second referendum, Sturgeon said: \u201cIf the Tory government rejects these efforts, if it insists on taking Scotland down a path that hurts our economy, costs jobs, lowers our living standards and damages our reputation as an open, welcoming, diverse country, then be in no doubt Scotland must have the ability to choose a better future. </p> <p>\u201cAnd I will make sure that Scotland gets that chance. And let us be clear about this, too. If that moment does arise, it will not be because the 2014 result hasn\u2019t been respected. It will be because the promises made to Scotland in 2014 have been broken.\u201d</p> <p>Sturgeon\u2019s comments came after the prime minister\u2019s spokesperson poured cold water over her plans to unveil draft legislation next week to prepare for a rerun of the 2014 referendum within the next two years. Downing Street had said that the SNP should respect the result of the last poll. </p> <p>Sturgeon told her conference: \u201cThere are many no voters now looking at the Brexit vote with real dismay and wondering if independence might be the best option for Scotland after all.\u201d </p> <p>The SNP leader also announced that Scotland would increase its presence on the continent through trade missions, including a permanent representation in Berlin.</p> <p>Sturgeon said: \u201cMake no mistake, the threat to our economy is not just the prospect of losing our place in the single market \u2013 disastrous though that would be.</p> <p>\u201cIt is also the deeply damaging \u2013 and utterly shameful \u2013 message that the Tories\u2019 rhetoric about foreign workers is sending to the world.

An aircraft equipped with advanced cameras is set to circle high above their heads, as part of a secretive surveillance programme funded by Texan billionaires.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/12/security-fears-fbi-contracting-out-sensitive-surveillance-documents\">Security fears over FBI contracting out highly sensitive surveillance documents</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Last year, Radiolab, a public radio show, <a href=\"http://www.radiolab.org/story/eye-sky/\">featured</a> a company called Persistent Surveillance Systems, which specialises in wide-area eye-in-the-sky technology. It flies a small plane for hours above urban areas, taking thousands of photographs that are sent to analysts who then track movements at street level.</p> <p>After the radio segment aired, the philanthropist John Arnold got in touch with the owner of Persistent, Ross McNutt. Arnold and his wife, Laura, were intrigued by the technology\u2019s crime-fighting potential and agreed to fund a trial somewhere. With $360,000 from the Arnolds, McNutt struck a deal with Baltimore.</p> <p>From January to August this year, Baltimore police <a href=\"http://bigstory.ap.org/article/a6dcf44c94ea4d22af93fab93d77d52b/baltimore-police-release-flight-logs-surveillance-plane\">said</a> at a news conference last week, the plane flew over the city for 314 hours, taking more than a million images. The police added that the plane would operate as an anti-terrorism measure during Fleet Week, which started on Monday, and the marathon.</p> <p>This spurt of transparency was more than a little tardy. Until Bloomberg Businessweek <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2016-baltimore-secret-surveillance/\">ran a story in August</a>, virtually no one knew about the surveillance programme, not even the mayor. Yet the technology raises obvious civil liberties questions, as does the way the plan was funded: by unaccountable private citizens in Houston whose wealth silently enabled a blanket tracking tool in a large city with notoriously strained relations between police and residents.</p> <p>\u201c[John Arnold] called me, and he just heard it on the Radiolab piece and asked what he could do to help, and he thought we could run a test with the system and I said we would love to and we appreciate his help,\u201d said McNutt. \u201cThey\u2019re fantastic people, they really are, and they\u2019re doing great things and trying to help out as much as they can.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>They\u2019re fantastic people, they really are, and they\u2019re doing great things and trying to help out as much as they can</p> <footer> <cite>Ross McNutt, Persistent Surveillance Systems, on the Arnolds</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The Arnolds are not universally loved. Two years ago, a Bloomberg profile of John Arnold was headlined: <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-11-19/a-legendary-trader-is-making-few-friends-as-he-donates-billions\">Giving Back Has Made This 41-year-old Retired Billionaire Less Popular.</a></p> <p>The Dallas-born Arnold was a millionaire Enron trader who became a billionaire hedge fund manager. He quit at 38, having amassed a reported $4bn fortune, and started the Laura and John Arnold Foundation with his wife, a former attorney. They have committed to giving the bulk of their wealth to philanthropic causes and have an appetite for forensic examination of complex and often divisive issues. </p> <p>According to the Foundation, it has awarded more than $617m in grant money since 2011, in line with its aim of seeking \u201ctransformational change\u201d through \u201cstrategic investments in criminal justice, education, evidence-based policy and innovation, public accountability, and research integrity\u201d.</p> <p>The Foundation <a href=\"http://www.arnoldfoundation.org/grants/\">has helped</a> a wide range of institutions and causes, from universities to civil rights groups such as the American Civil Liberties Union Foundation and the Southern Poverty Law Center, both of which received grants to combat the problem of indigent defendants being detained because they cannot afford to pay court fines.</p> <p>Personally, the Arnolds have backed Democratic politicians including Barack Obama and Chicago mayor Rahm Emanuel, and <a href=\"http://www.lauraandjohnarnold.com/personal-advocacy-and-political-contributions/\">sent</a> at least $5m to Planned Parenthood\u2019s political wing.</p> <p>Until now, the Foundation\u2019s efforts on pension reform have drawn the most media attention, with some unions expressing outrage at proposals they claim would drastically cut back the retirement incomes of public sector workers.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"An example of the \u2018eye in the sky\u2019 technology from Persistent Surveillance Systems.\">  <iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/93776366\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>An example of the \u2018eye in the sky\u2019 technology from Persistent Surveillance Systems.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWhat I like about their philanthropy is that they are bold and they are more willing to take risks and be controversial than your typical foundation,\u201d said Aaron Dorfman, president and CEO of the National Committee for Responsive Philanthropy, a research and advocacy group. \u201cThat said,\u201d he added, citing their pensions work and the surveillance scheme, \u201csome of the things that they are trying to make happen in the world are of dubious merit.</p> <p>\u201cThe problem here is that policing is a public good and decisions about how to do policing ought to be made by the public and in the sunshine with full transparency. In this case you had none of that \u2013 you had donors who thought it would be a good idea to test this new technology and a police force that was willing to take their money and try this out and the community had no idea this was going on. To me that\u2019s a big problem.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/feb/19/koch-brothers-liberals-prison-reform\">Koch brothers join up with liberals to tackle rising prison numbers</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Arnolds, who for the Baltimore project gave money personally rather than through their foundation, turned down an interview request, via a representative. \u201cWe invest in a wide array of criminal justice issues and policies, including strategies for improving the clearance rate of criminal cases,\u201d they said in a statement.</p> <p>\u201cOne such strategy is to use technology to assist police in early-stage investigations. To that end, we personally provided financial support for the aerial surveillance tool being piloted in Baltimore. As a society, we should seek to understand whether these technologies yield significant benefits, while carefully weighing any such benefits against corresponding tradeoffs to privacy.\u201d</p> <p>A sceptic might argue that society cannot understand something it does not know about. David Rocah, senior staff attorney at the ACLU of Maryland, said his organisation was concerned by the nature of the surveillance and the opaque way it was adopted. </p> <p>\u201cWhat the secret funding from the Arnolds meant,\u201d he said, \u201cis that it didn\u2019t even have to be disclosed to the city\u2019s purchasing folks and the mayor didn\u2019t know, the city council didn\u2019t know \u2026 nobody knew.</p> <p>\u201cThe fact is that surveillance technologies are acquired by police departments all over the country all the time with zero public input, even where the Arnolds aren\u2019t secretly funding it. This case is just an extraordinary, an extreme, example of a larger problem.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Surveillance technologies are acquired by police departments all over the country all the time with zero public input</p> <footer> <cite>David Rocah, ACLU of Maryland</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Most of the money was passed to Baltimore through the Police Foundation, a not-for-profit research body in Washington that previously worked with the Arnold Foundation on a study of eyewitness identification procedure. As soon as next week, the Police Foundation intends to release a report that will examine the potential value of McNutt\u2019s surveillance technology.</p> <p>\u201cIt is very common for philanthropic organisations that are interested in advancing policing or studying it, or something [similar], to fund studies,\u201d said Jim Bueermann, president of the Police Foundation. </p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s my belief that there are other police departments that are currently using similar technology or will be in the future and we want to find out: is it effective? And where are the limits to this in terms of civil liberties? And how does a police department go about using this kind of technology and doing so in a way that enhances community trust and confidence in the department and not detract from it?\u201d</p> <p>Dorfman expects more city governments to cultivate relationships with wealthy donors, citing the example of Kalamazoo, Michigan, which recently asked local philanthropists for an endowment so the city could lower taxes but <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-09-29/kalamazoo-asks-the-rich-for-donations-instead-of-hiking-taxes\">increase services</a>.</p> <p>\u201cAs government is more and more starved for resources, there are increasingly efforts to replace what should be government spending with philanthropic dollars and that can be for police or other public services,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cThe problem with this is that we are a democracy, or supposed to be a democracy, and we should be willing to tax ourselves at rates where we can pay for the public services that we want and need for our communities \u2013 and it should not be left to the whims of billionaires to decide which public goods get paid for and which don\u2019t.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Why are we all so shocked by the sexual assault allegations against Donald Trump? It has always been clear that his attitudes toward women are dangerously retrograde; he\u2019s never tried to hide who he is. Quite the opposite in fact; he\u2019s built a successful brand out of being an offensive playboy who\u2019s allowed to get away with it. In short, he\u2019s built his entire career on the foundation of what feminist academics call \u201crape culture\u201d.</p> <p>If you\u2019re confused by the term, \u201crape culture\u201d describes the normalization of sexual violence in society \u2013 and it\u2019s this very normalization that makes it a difficult thing to explain. Rape culture doesn\u2019t so much actively encourage rape as passively condone it. You can\u2019t pin it down to one particular thing; rather it\u2019s the accumulation of a number of social norms that perpetuate the idea that women are sexual objects, and that sexual objectification is simply a fact of life.</p> <p>Trump is a one-man textbook of such norms. So let\u2019s use him as such. I\u2019ve broken down the various assumptions, stock phrases, and social expectations that, together, constitute rape culture. Trump has helpfully provided examples of each.</p> <h2>Women are sexual objects, to be judged as such</h2> <p><em>\u201cLook at that face! Would anyone vote for that?

While the competitors in this year\u2019s women\u2019s road race world championships will have their eyes firmly on the prize, the contest promises a host of potentially spellbinding sideshows and minor-key dramas. British interest will focus on Lizzie Deignan, the reigning champion, who is approaching the 134.5km course around Doha as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/14/lizzie-deignan-urges-cycling-world-governing-body-to-clarify-rules-on-theraputic-use-exemptions\">\u201cthe last weekend of a tough year\u201d</a> defined by her <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/01/rio-2016-lizzie-armitstead-court-appeal-olympics\">successful appeal</a> against a doping ban in the prelude to the Olympics. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the controversy in which she became embroiled after missing three tests under the whereabouts rule has taken a mental toll on Deignan, and the noises emanating from her camp \u2013 not to mention the rider herself \u2013 suggest the combined effects of fatigue and an unfavourable course may be too much to handle.</p> <p><strong>But it\u2019s not all about Deignan.</strong> A flat course with no climbs will inevitably favour the sprinters, which makes Kirsten Wild of the Netherlands the woman to beat.

The context of today\u2019s meeting between Chelsea and Leicester City demonstrates the good and bad of the Premier League. The good: the league is so unpredictable that the last two champions can meet with no serious prospect of winning the league this season. The bad is that the football at the top end has been of such low quality \u2013 compared to the other big leagues, and the Premier League from 1997 to 2009 - that these teams could win it in the first place.</p> <p>Leicester know how the Stone Roses felt in the early 1990s. You can\u2019t follow last season\u2019s triumph, so they haven\u2019t bothered.

Instead of learning lessons, party members fear, Trump\u2019s supports will believe they were stabbed in the back, as Trump has insinuated at rallies. </p> <p>At least three factions of the party will struggle for control: ideologues led by Ryan, an establishment embodied by former presidents George HW and George W Bush (neither of whom endorsed Trump), and a so-called \u201cBreitbart wing\u201d, led by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/26/steve-bannon-florida-registered-vote-donald-trump\">Steve Bannon</a> of the rightwing news network, now chief executive of the Trump campaign.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be a war,\u201d said <a href=\"https://twitter.com/rickwtyler?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Rick Tyler</a>, a political analyst and former spokesperson for the primary runner-up, Ted Cruz. \u201cThe Breitbart wing is going to try to impose its will on the party and its brand of Republicanism, which is win at all costs without a guiding philosophy. The establishment is well funded but represents the status quo. The conservatives are underfunded and underrepresented and lack a leader to convince Americans why it\u2019s a winning strategy and philosophy.\u201d</p> <p>Tyler cited Ryan, <a href=\"http://www.in.gov/gov/2358.htm\">Mike Pence</a>, the Indiana governor who is Trump\u2019s running mate, and Tom Cotton, a senator from Arkansas, as potential leaders. But he noted: \u201cRonald Reagan was not obvious. They emerge. They\u2019re not obvious, so I don\u2019t know who they are. You won\u2019t know who they are until they come forward. As we saw with Winston Churchill, great leaders emerge in times of great turmoil.\u201d</p> <p>He also struck a rare optimistic note. \u201cIt\u2019s an exciting time to be a Republican. With turmoil there\u2019s also opportunity. The party could work on a new brand and a new set of leaders.\u201d</p> <p>Others, however, saw no future in Trump\u2019s destructive wake. Asked where the Republican party should go from here, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ttancredo\">Tom Tancredo</a>, a former Republican congressman from Colorado, replied: \u201cTo hell. At least I hope so. If they do go south, the demise of the Republican party is the only good thing that can come of it. It has no relevance philosophically and so it deserves to go.\u201d</p> <p>Tancredo, the head of the Team America political action committee, likened the scenario to the 2004 disaster movie The Day After Tomorrow. \u201cWe have to think about the day after the election and what should we do as conservatives. The major problem trying to have a movement take hold in America is a lack of leader. You have to have someone who can articulate their concerns and inspire people.</p> <p>\u201cI haven\u2019t the foggiest ideas who that may be. I guess they\u2019re yet to be discovered because I can\u2019t name one. I would have said Cruz but he self-destructed plus he\u2019s not charismatic. You need a Reagan.\u201d</p> <p>For the conservative blogger Erick Erickson, the key is rediscovering the party\u2019s moral compass after many defended the indefensible in Trump. \u201cMost important, the Republican party must recommit to a basic principle \u2013 character counts,\u201d he <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/14/opinion/erick-erickson-the-gop-after-donald-trump.html\">wrote in the New York Times</a> on Friday. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0792704cfd9f04af285b5ab44a90905daff76e94\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0792704cfd9f04af285b5ab44a90905daff76e94/127_381_4738_2844/1000.jpg\" alt=\"trump supporters cheer\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The party will survive \u2013 \u2018they always do,\u2019 says the pollster Frank Luntz.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ddp USA/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There could be light at the end of the tunnel. Clinton, herself deeply unpopular, will be trying to defy political gravity if she runs for a fourth successive Democratic presidential term in 2020. Republicans could also learn from Democrats in 1992 who, after three losses, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/apr/04/democratic-republican-party-bill-clinton-hillary-us-election-2016\">reinvented themselves</a> and swept back into power with Bill Clinton.<br></p> <p>The Republican pollster <a href=\"https://twitter.com/FrankLuntz?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Frank Luntz</a> saw another historical parallel. \u201cI am expecting a Republican insurrection similar to what happened to the Democrats after George McGovern lost in 1972,\u201d he said. \u201cEvery component of the GOP will be at war with each other. There will be an attempt to unseat Paul Ryan as speaker. You\u2019ll hear \u2018I told you so\u2019 from Ted Cruz and John Kasich.</p> <p>\u201cThe House, which will still be controlled by Republicans, will be at war with the Senate \u2013 which is truly up for grabs. It will be nasty, ugly and very personal. Far more effort will be spent blaming each other than trying to pull together.\u201d </p> <p>Still, Luntz said that Republicans would survive just as Democrats did in the 1970s. \u201cThey always do.\u201d</p> <p>But part of the reckoning may have to be a realisation that Trump\u2019s hostile takeover did not occur in a vacuum. Critics have argued that he merely said, in a crude and explicit way, what many rightwing Republicans have been saying for years in code resulting in racially charged anger, obstruction in Congress and cancer in the body politic. </p> <p>Barack Obama, now at the end of his term, recently articulated the idea <a href=\"http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2016/10/barack-obama-on-5-days-that-shaped-his-presidency.html\">to New York Magazine</a>. \u201cI see a straight line from the announcement of Sarah Palin as the vice-presidential nominee [in 2008] to what we see today in Donald Trump, the emergence of the Freedom Caucus, the Tea Party, and the shift in the center of gravity for the Republican party,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cWhether that changes, I think, will depend in part on the outcome of this election, but it\u2019s also going to depend on the degree of self-reflection inside the Republican party. There have been at least a couple of other times that I\u2019ve said confidently that the fever is going to have to break, but it just seems to get worse.\u201d<br></p>",
  "<p>Theresa May has rightly read the Brexit vote as a popular revolt against metropolitan trendies like David Cameron and Jeremy Corbyn and every other variant of the species. Given the chance to poke the whole pack of us in the eye, what with our \u201cprogressive\u201d values and smug, big city ways, Leavers seized it with Faragist glee. The prime minister has taken their cue. Disastrous, disordered and unlovely it may be, but her Brexit stance has, at least for now, <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/2016/09/new-times-john-gray-moving-right-new-times\">caught the mood</a> and achieved the substantial feat of making the Labour leader and his coterie look even more clueless than they did already.</p> <p>But May presumably also knows that the path she\u2019s set could lead to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/13/great-marmite-war-reality-brexit-bite\">economic calamity</a>. For now, she can afford a bit of that: prosperous Outers may be ready to be a little worse off for a while in return for their hoped-for reassertion of their idea of their country\u2019s true identity; the less prosperous who voted Leave, many of whom don\u2019t normally vote at all, have low expectations about everything anyway. Even so, May won\u2019t want to preside over too steep or too ugly a decline. With <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/video/2016/oct/12/keir-starmer-on-brexit-on-what-terms-should-we-leave-the-eu-video\">Keir Starmer on the case</a>, even Her Majesty\u2019s Opposition might help make <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/13/nicola-sturgeon-brexit-theresa-may-snp-scotland\">something useful</a> out of it. That is why May badly needs the very things the Brexit vibe she\u2019s milking most reviles.</p> <p>London, like it or not - and this is hardly ideal - is the key to UK financial health. Globalised, multicultured and full of immigrants, it powered through the last recession as the rest of proud Britannia flailed. At <a href=\"http://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefing/Summary/SN05795\">the last count</a>, London was generating \u00a3364bn of the UK\u2019s \u00a31,590bn annual economic output \u2013 a massive 23% of it, with the surrounding south east of England contributing a further 15%.</p> <p>Between 2010 and 2014, London\u2019s economy grew by 6.8% compared with 4.4% for the UK as a whole. London\u2019s workers\u2019 output is 73% above the average. When Brexit darling Boris Johnson <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/10052775/We-must-be-ready-to-leave-the-EU-if-we-dont-get-what-we-want.html\">wrote three years ago</a> that \u201cwe can no longer blame Brussels\u201d for our problems and should look instead at our own \u201csloth\u201d \u2013 especially when compared with \u201cthe Germans\u201d \u2013 he might have named the labour force of the city he (loosely-speaking) led as mayor at the time as an exception. </p> <p>Britons who fear and loathe London and all it symbolises in their eyes might note that taxes raised in the capital help fund their public transport, their affordable housing, their health services, their schools, their police officers and the upkeep of their public footpaths and parks. Almost one third of UK taxes are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/jul/07/london-top-taxpaying-city-uk-report\">raised in London</a>. A <a href=\"http://www.standard.co.uk/news/mayor/give-london-back-its-tax-boris-johnson-demands-return-on-cash-that-capital-makes-for-britain-7618555.html\">report</a> compiled for Johnson found that the equivalent of \u00a32,500 per Londoner subsides the rest of the UK every year.</p> <p>So here\u2019s an irony: even as the PM endorses the disruption of all that is integral to the nation\u2019s capital \u2013 its international business links, its receptiveness to foreign incomers, its resulting cultural variety - she is to draw more deeply from its well of wealth. A <a href=\"http://www.standard.co.uk/news/london/business-rates-for-thousands-of-london-firms-to-rocket-next-year-in-government-raid-on-cash-cow-a3365091.html\">revaluation of business rates</a> looks set to increase London\u2019s tax bill by an average of 11% - amounting to more than \u00a3700m - while in most of the rest of England rates will go down.</p> <p>Johnson\u2019s successor at City Hall, Sadiq Khan, has called this a \u201ckick in the teeth\u201d for the capital. The London Chamber of Commerce and Industry has warned of the dangers of London business being <a href=\"http://www.londonchamber.co.uk/lcc_public/article.asp?id=0&amp;did=47&amp;aid=8025&amp;st=&amp;oaid=-1\">seen as a cash cow</a>. The Institute for Fiscal Studies comments from a <a href=\"https://www.ifs.org.uk/publications/8689\">wider angle</a>: \u201cIt will contribute to the ongoing trend of the UK government becoming more and more dependent on revenue from London to fund services across the whole\u201d. </p> <p>Here is the intensifying context for the continuing debates about giving London government and those of other big city regions greater autonomy. No one is demanding a bigger piece of the pie, just more control over the piece they have. Regional, rather than Whitehall, decisions about transport infrastructure, housing, schools and skills training should mean better results, with social and economic gains to follow.</p> <p>Progress in that direction had already been made in the form of new, executive \u201cmetro\u201d mayoralties for Greater Manchester, the Liverpool city region and the West Midlands. Inaugural elections will take place next year. The victors will be looking for more powers to be sent their way. In London, Khan is pressing for post-Brexit arrangements that will help the capital, which voted 60-40 to Remain, to maintain its status as a city that is \u201copen for business\u201d, including the creation of a <a href=\"http://www.cityam.com/248272/we-should-regionalise-immigration-decisions-starting-london\">London-only work visa</a>.</p> <p>Some of his critics, still truffling for imagined un-Britishness in the born-and-bred Tooting boy, imply that in so doing he seeks to <a href=\"http://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/715172/Sadiq-Khan-defy-Brexit-London-open-visas-migrants-mayor-theresa-may-boris-johnson-trade\">subvert the national will</a>. Well London, didn\u2019t want what \u201cGood old Boris\u201d helped them get, and other big cities felt much the same way. They are the very parts of Britain the prime minister must help to better help themselves if Britain is to survive her Brexit strategy. She needs London.

In particular, balancing the books in 2018 and 2019 when funding will flatline looks all but impossible with the current level of services. If more money from tax or borrowing is ruled out, the only choices left may be even less attractive, including reducing access and services, closures and reductions in staff.\u201d</p> <p>Jeremy Hunt, the health secretary, and Jim Mackey, the chief executive of the health service\u2019s financial regulator, NHS Improvement, also attended the 8 September meeting, which was Stevens\u2019s and Mackey\u2019s first encounter with the prime minister.</p> <p>\u201cNo 10\u2019s message at the meeting was quite blunt and stark: that there will be no more money. Theresa May and Philip Hammond say that they presided over big efficiency programmes at the Home Office and MoD and didn\u2019t whinge about it. Their view is that the NHS is already doing very well, but that\u2019s head-in-the-sand stuff,\u201d said one NHS insider who was among those briefed on the meeting.</p> <p>A Downing Street spokesman said he could not comment on what May, Stevens and Mackey had discussed because it had been a private meeting.</p> <p>NHS leaders privately fear May\u2019s remarks indicate she will be much tougher on the service\u2019s pleas for more cash than David Cameron and that she does not appear to appreciate the extent of its deepening problems.

The NHS boss, who had a close relationship with Cameron and George Osborne, recently irritated No 10 by publicly questioning the accuracy of the government\u2019s claim \u2013 which May repeated at prime minister\u2019s questions on Wednesday \u2013 that the NHS would receive \u00a310bn extra by 2020.</p> <p>He told the public accounts committee last month: \u201cThe government would record it as \u00a310bn. The health committee recorded it a little differently. There is an apples and pears issue there.\u201d</p> <p>Stevens has welcomed the fact that the \u00a38bn boost Osborne pledged during last year\u2019s general election campaign was frontloaded to give the NHS \u00a33.8bn more this year, a rise of 1.7%, as he had requested. But he highlighted that the service had not got the sums it needed for 2017-18, 2018-19 and 2019-20. On current plans, it is due to receive increases of just 0.6%, 0.2% and 0.1% respectively, even though demand for core NHS services such as A&amp;E care is rising at 3% or 4% a year.</p> <p>Chris Ham, the chief executive of the King\u2019s Fund thinktank, said any policy of providing no more money was unwise, \u201csimply not credible\u201d and would threaten standards of NHS care. \u201cIf these accounts are true, then it is clear that Downing Street does not yet fully understand the impact on patients of the huge pressures facing the NHS.</p> <p>\u201cThe view from the top of government appears to be that the NHS has been given the extra money it asked for and should deliver what is expected of it. But this misses the point that demand for services is rising rapidly and the NHS is managing with the lowest funding increases in its history,\u201d he said.</p>",

That\u2019s [counts on fingers, toes\u2026 ears\u2026 nose] 43 days ago. A rabbit\u2019s gestation period is shorter than that. What do rabbits have to do with anything? I\u2019ll ask the questions around here.</p> <p>As we settle into our settees it\u2019s worth wondering what effect the long layoff will have on the players. Will Josh Dugan have forgotten how to pass the ball? \u2014 presuming, of course, he knows how to pass one in the first place (which he doesn\u2019t). While we\u2019re at it, we might also wonder what effect the coming Four Nations will have. On the one hand, we have players pushing for a starting berth for the tournament (which begins with Australia v Scotland on October 28 in Hull before England take on New Zealand in Huddersfield); on the other, it\u2019s not exactly an opportune time to pick up an injury. </p> <p>Do these two things balance each other out? Do they need to? Perhaps Australia and New Zealand couldn\u2019t play a friendly in a friendly manner if their lives depended on it. I suppose that\u2019s why rugby league never uses the term \u2018friendly\u2019 (though Storm teammates Cameron Smith and Jesse Bromwich sure look friendly enough here):</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/NRL/status/787095672361136128\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Game day!<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/RoosKiwis?src=hash\">#RoosKiwis</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/QbCWWC3CkR\">pic.twitter.com/QbCWWC3CkR</a></p>&mdash; NRL (@NRL) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NRL/status/787095672361136128\">October 15, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>This is all a roundabout way of saying I have no idea what to expect from this game.

But if it looked like descending into the mire an absolute moment of real brilliance elevated this contest.</p> <p>Tim Cahill. Does this bloke ever stop delivering? Scroll down and find the vision \u2013 it\u2019s a 40 yard screamer, and he\u2019s announced his presence back in Australia and the A-League.</p> <p>He had an absolutely brilliant supporting cast; Kamau was electric, Fornaroli as slippery and wily as we knew last season, and Brandan an energetic presence and thorn in the defence.</p> <p>Asked what went wrong post-game, coach Kevin Muscat answered: \u201cWell, where do you start?\u201d </p> <p>\u201cStructurally we were very, very poor. We lost our composure \u2013 it was an arm-wrestle that we were second best in.\u201d</p> <p>So shots fired in the A-League. If people thought Sydney FC sent a message last week in the Sydney derby, that was nothing compared to what City just threw down.</p> <p>The challenge will be to back this up week-in, week-out, but for now it\u2019s all about cross-city bragging rights; and they\u2019ve send the Victory home with their tails between their legs.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5802099be4b047a4eaafcbbe\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-15T10:51:30.995Z\">11.51am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Full-time: Melbourne Victory 1-4 Melbourne City</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>90 + 4 min: </strong>Huge chance for Fitzgerald right at the death, but Thomas does well to save at his feet, with the former Mariner one-on-one.</p> <p>And that\u2019s it!

You\u2019d say \u201cno pressure, kid\u201d, but then his club debut did come against Juventus in the International Champions Cup.</p> <p>While the derby is always good for some fireworks (on the pitch, preferably), this season\u2019s first clash is set to have added spice given the arrival of Cahill. Bruno Fornaroli\u2019s arrival last season and his prolific goalscoring alongside Harry Novillo and Aaron Mooy meant City, perhaps for the first time, stepped out of the shadow of their more established competitors.</p> <p>Now with Cahill in town and Victory\u2019s failure to secure big-name signing Michael Essien, all the early season hype appears set to surround the upstarts.</p> <p>It\u2019s a great opportunity for the (nominally) home side Victory to do their talking <em>on</em> the pitch; the loss of marquee Troisi is a setback, but the return to health of captain Carl Valeri will feel like a new signing, so key is he to their season\u2019s chances.</p> <p>City have long suffered the tag of being \u2018soft\u2019 \u2013 with John van \u2018t Schip\u2019s team far too inconsistent despite their flashes of brilliance. If they can add the quality of mettle to their abundantly talented squad, this could be the season that really announces the club as A-League big boys.</p> <p>A massive opportunity to strike the first blow in the battle for Melbourne supremacy tonight therefore; it should be a real lip-licker. </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-580055a7e4b01601238959d9\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-14T03:49:23.227Z\">4.49am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Richard will be with you shortly but in the meantime, check out David Squires\u2019 take on the second weekend of A-League action.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/picture/2016/oct/13/david-squires-on-an-exciting-week-for-australian-football\">David Squires on ... an exciting week for Australian football</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div>",
  "<p>Andrew Jones was shocked when his wife started a child custody battle in 2014. The couple had separated five months earlier after, he says, he caught her in a series of extramarital affairs. They had agreed on an informal settlement: he moved from their 2,700 sq ft home into a mobile home, paid her $500 a month in child support and could spend equal time with their five- and three-year-old kids. When he received the letter with a court date, Jones was not hopeful.</p> <p>\u201cI felt like I wasn\u2019t going to have a life,\u201d says the 46-year-old who works as an HVAC technician. \u201cI heard so many horror stories of divorce and how pretty much women get all your paycheques and you have no way to live.\u201d</p> <p>Jones (his last name was changed to protect the identity of his children) represented himself in court while his wife hired an attorney who he says is \u201cwell-known\u201d in their North Carolina county for \u201cgetting women anything and everything they want in court\u201d. The attorney, he says \u201ckind of gives you the feeling that she hates men. That all men are dogs and men don\u2019t want to be in their child\u2019s lives.\u201d</p> <p>Jones nervously told the judge all he wanted was equal time with his kids. The following month, he received a letter from the court saying he owed $1,300 a month in child support \u2013 a payment that would be big stretch on his wage of $26 an hour. He had already cleared out his savings to pay off his and his wife\u2019s combined debts, so to keep up with payments Jones sold his truck, $4,000 worth of tools, and stopped eating out or having a social life. But the money wasn\u2019t even the worst part: he was only allowed to see his kids eight days out of the month.</p> <p>\u201cWhen you have kids it changes your life,\u201d he says. \u201cYou can\u2019t go without them and [when you do] it wears you down emotionally and physically.\u201d</p> <p>In family law, tales of fathers who pay exorbitant child support and rarely get to see their kids are commonplace. Recently, firms that specialize in men\u2019s divorce have popped up all over America to capitalize on so-called gender-based discrimination in courts. While many family law firms have <a href=\"http://www.mensdivorcelaw.com/most-lawyers-experiencing-slower-business-due-to-economy/\">seen a drop</a> in divorce filings, these niche attorneys claim business is thriving. </p> <p>Yet their very existence if controversial. Critics claim any good lawyer is equipped to handle a man\u2019s divorce and that instead of pushing for greater equality under the law, these firms perpetuate sexist stereotypes about women. </p> <p>While family laws are gender neutral, there\u2019s no doubt that judges and lawyers interpret them based on certain beliefs. In many cases, judges still consider a woman the more natural caretaker, a stubborn holdover from the decades in which mothers only worked at home.</p> <p>According to <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/prod/2013pubs/p60-246.pdf\">recent</a> census data, 82% of mothers have primary custody of their children and 53% collect child support, compared with 29% of men. The numbers certainly suggest the need for men\u2019s divorce attorneys, but they lack important context: less than <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/cathy-meyer/dispelling-the-myth-of-ge_b_1617115.html\">5%</a> of child support cases are actually settled in court, which means most parents decide themselves that the mother should be the primary caregiver. After all, a <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/files/2011/06/fathers-FINAL-report.pdf\">Pew survey</a> shows married women spend twice as much time with their kids than their husbands do. </p> <p>But Joseph Cordell, founder of the largest men\u2019s <a href=\"http://cordellcordell.com/\">divorce-focused firm in America</a>, says the stereotypes of mothers as nurturers and men as providers leads to systemic discrimination against fathers. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>These men\u2019s divorce firms perpetuate the stereotype of a woman who\u2019s just after her husband\u2019s money</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cAs a society we\u2019ve made progress regarding gender in a number of areas,\u201d he says. \u201cBut the dark corner of the room when it comes to civil rights, I can tell you, is dads\u2019 rights in family courts.\u201d</p> <p>The most common issues, he says, are that men rarely get equal access to their children and are often victims of false abuse allegations. Cordell estimates that 85% of temporary restraining order requests during divorces are mere \u201ctactics\u201d. Margaret Ryznar, an associate law professor at Indiana University, says her research shows a minority of women seek protective orders during divorce and that since domestic abuse is a he-said, she-said crime it\u2019s often impossible to prove \u201cwho\u2019s lying and who\u2019s not\u201d.</p> <p>Kirby Ingles, who lives in Missouri, says he experienced bias during the 2009 custody battle for his five-year-old son. His attorney, who did not specialize in men\u2019s divorce, told him that the court judge would \u201cmost likely lean towards [your ex-wife\u2019s] side because the child is five or six years old so needs their mother\u201d. Ingles wanted more custody and joint decision-making but was told this is how judges usually rule. \u201cThey didn\u2019t really want to do the work and put up a fight and do any digging in the case,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Ingle\u2019s wife got primary custody, but he has hired a men\u2019s divorce lawyer to renegotiate his child support payments after being hit with a decrease in his salary. He says his new advocate is \u201cmore sincere and compassionate to his needs\u201d than a regular family law lawyer and is more equipped to deal with specific issues that affect him such as father alienation.</p> <p>But not all experts think men\u2019s divorce specialists provide added value. Ryznar thinks regular family law attorneys are equipped to handle any case and that the niche men\u2019s firms are largely a marketing ploy to \u201cdrum up business\u201d.</p> <p>Many also see an underlying sexism in firms that specialize in father\u2019s rights, a flagpole issue of the misogynistic men\u2019s rights movement. Ryznar says that while stay-at-home moms are less common these days, working women <a href=\"http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/10/01/women-more-than-men-adjust-their-careers-for-family-life/\">still</a> do <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/in-two-career-marriages-women-still-do-more-of-the-work-at-home-1443600654\">most</a> of the domestic work, which has a negative impact on their salaries. \u201cCourts take into account and compensate [mothers] for the fact that [they] took hits to their career to take care of kids,\u201d she says. \u201cThese men\u2019s divorce firms perpetuate the stereotype of a woman who\u2019s just after her husband\u2019s money. That is not true in many real cases.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/oct/14/nesting-divorce-parents-children-custody\">Parenting after divorce: the art of not being ugly</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But Cordell, who is a supporter of the men\u2019s rights movement, finds these arguments absurd. He views the treatment of men in divorces as a civil rights issue, equating their struggle for equality with that of black people fighting against racism and segregation in the south. \u201cTo suggest to me that guys asking for fairness in family court are guilty of some sort of anti-feminist position or sexism is beyond response,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s an insult to guys.\u201d</p> <p>Of course, some men\u2019s rights attorneys hold less extreme views. Anne Mitchell, who opened one of the first fathers\u2019 rights practices in the 1990s, is anti- \u201cangry men\u2019s organizations\u201d but says the stereotype that most men want to dodge child support is also not true.</p> <p>\u201cOverwhelmingly guys [are] not looking for custody or to screw their exes,\u201d she says. \u201cThey\u2019re just looking to be more involved in their children\u2019s lives than the typical still default schedule: every other weekend and one day during the week.\u201d Mitchell, who no longer sees clients, strove to give fathers a reality check about which legal battles were worth fighting.</p> <p>\u201cAs a society we have really come to demonize men. There\u2019s just definitely a faction that believes all boys have the potential to grow up as rapists and are angry,\u201d she says. \u201cWithout the right coaching \u2026 [men] show up at courts looking angry and that feeds right into the bias.\u201d Mitchell always tried to keep dads out of court, preferring to settle matters in counseling \u2013 a strategy she said most firms focused on billable hours unfortunately avoid.</p> <p>There\u2019s no doubt Jones, the man struggling to afford child support, was in a better situation before stepping foot in a courtroom. About a year and a half after his initial appearance, he returned to court with a lawyer to argue for more visitation rights. He was unsuccessful \u2013 his ex-wife\u2019s lawyer argued that he was an unfit father because he \u201cwhoops\u201d his kids\u2019 butts with a belt to discipline them, which he admits is true, and is often on call for work.</p> <p>But without regular access to his kids, Jones says his life has deteriorated. His ex wouldn\u2019t let him talk to their kids on the phone and he stopped getting notified by their school about report cards and field trips.</p> <p>Jones began lashing out at colleagues, and was written up so many times by management that he was fired. His new gig pays less \u2013 $22 an hour \u2013 and as a result he\u2019s more than $5,000 behind on his child support payments and $2,200 behind in rent. Now when Jones sees his kids, he can\u2019t even afford the $10 to take them to their favorite place, a bounce house with inflatable slides. </p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m home alone and have no money to go nowhere,\u201d he says. \u201cI can\u2019t \u2026 even get my kids something. I don\u2019t wish this for nobody. I feel like a homeless guy with a job.\u201d<br></p>",
  "<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/dmitri-shostakovich\">Shostakovich</a>\u2019s <em>The</em> <em>Nose</em>, composed in his early 20s, is a fabulously exaggerated, cacophonous, insanely over-the-top satirical fantasy written by a young man wholly and exuberantly indulging in his role as enfant terrible. The story comes from Gogol, whose masterly output of short stories can be crudely divided into rural and urban. In his collection of Ukrainian tales, <em>Evenings on a Farm near Dikanka</em>, he used a romanticised background of village life to tell a series of vivid stories richly peopled with devils, <em>rusalki</em> (mermaids) and ghosts set against a marvellous gallery of village characters: grumpy elders, strutting peasant lads and simpering dark-eyed maidens. This colourful collection of stories would inspire several operas by Rimsky-Korsakov and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/pyotr-tchaikovsky\">Tchaikovsky</a>, and is a close cousin of the Jewish folktales from the shtetl that were lovingly recorded by Sholem Aleichem.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jan/30/my-hero-dmitri-shostakovich-by-julian-barnes\">My hero: Dmitri Shostakovich by Julian Barnes</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Gogol\u2019s \u201curban\u201d works display a similar technique and characters but in a very different context: St Petersburg.

Seeking an outlet to the west (via the Baltic) and a symbolic separation from the traditionalist stronghold of Moscow, he ordered a city built in a swamp beside the river Neva. Despite its buildings of unparalleled magnificence, St Petersburg always had the whiff of fakery about it, and when the freezing fog welled up from the Neva one might imagine that all these apparently solid palaces could in a moment slide into the mud and vanish. This was the city\u2019s phantasmagorical underbelly, which Gogol chose to explore.</p> <p>However, phantasmagoria was not the end but the means of his deftly constructed novellas. The goal was to satirise St Petersburg\u2019s expanding nouveau riche society \u2013 an invented society to people its invented streets. As in most nouveau riche societies, people took themselves and their new positions very seriously. Titles and uniforms were all-important, and a vastly overblown bureaucracy exerted a malignant stranglehold based on rank and procedure. Gogol used the absurd to puncture this pomposity and pretension.</p> <p>In his story \u201cThe Overcoat\u201d he tells the tragic tale of the unspeakably poor and dull clerk Akaky Bashmachkin (<em>kaka</em> = shit, <em>bashmak</em> = shoe, so \u201cshitty shoe\u201d), who to his horror discovers that he needs a new overcoat. He scrapes and saves and fills his life with dreams of this garment, and when he finally achieves its purchase, it is a moment of redemptive ecstasy. A short while later he is robbed, the overcoat torn from his back, and he dies, heart-broken.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e5b4216e311a41708d0b7e3db55dc9658f0cd5a2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e5b4216e311a41708d0b7e3db55dc9658f0cd5a2/0_1026_4250_2550/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Iconoclastoc \u2026 Dmitri Shostakovich.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Iconoclastic \u2026 Dmitri Shostakovich.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>So far, this is a realist picture of grinding urban poverty. Now, however, a mysterious corpse starts to haunt the banks of the Neva, tearing the coats off the backs of prosperous citizens. Finally, the \u201csignificant personage\u201d who had treated Akaky with contempt when he came to seek redress for his robbery is himself robbed by this ghoul, and from that terrifying moment resolves to become a better man. The phantasmagorical brings about a moral dimension.</p> <p>Elements from this story found their way into Shostakovich\u2019s opera alongside Gogol\u2019s \u201cThe Nose\u201d, in which a \u201ccouncillor\u201d (a civil service rank) wakes up to discover that his nose has absconded. Suffering greatly from this literal loss of face, he is further horrified to discover that his nose is calmly walking the streets dressed in a uniform superior to his own, and is greeted on all sides with appropriate respect. In the end, a police inspector returns the nose to its owner, who is finally able to rejoin the promenading gentry on Nevsky Prospect, restored to his rightful status.</p> <p>Between these seemingly thin parameters, there lies an ocean of excess, performed by a cast with more than 80 named roles. Translating this mayhem into English was great fun, and the style of the work avoids many of the technical problems associated with other opera libretti, such as formal rhyme schemes. Also, since the musical style is brutal and utilitarian rather than mellifluous, there is not the same problem about the sonority of the language as would be the case with <em>Eugene Onegin</em>, for instance.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Everything is faster, slower, louder or, in\u00a0the case of the screaming police inspector, higher than you'd think possible</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It is of course unusual for the Royal Opera to perform in translation, but there is no doubt that immediacy of communication is valuable for a zany comedy of this kind. Even the surtitles are appropriate, as it was Shostakovich\u2019s stints as a pianist accompanying silent films that gave him a taste for high-energy pranks.</p> <p>He wrote <em>The Nose</em> from the unguarded standpoint of a young composer using his entire box of tricks at a time when the liberated Russian intelligentsia had free rein to experiment and revel in the avant garde. The first Stalinist crackdown was still around the corner. The result is almost a catalogue of all the devices and gestures that would become standard practice for mid-to\u2011late 20th-century modernist iconoclasm. The orchestra is encouraged at one point to shout out remarks to the singers, there is an ensemble entirely consisting of percussion, a group of 11 policemen sing a lugubrious song about tobacco and then gang-rape a screaming pie seller, a sheikh passes by and comments on the fascinating case of the disappearing nose, and a cynical doctor advises the victim to have his nose preserved in formaldehyde and sold as a curiosity. Everything is faster, slower, longer, louder or, especially in the case of the screaming police inspector, higher than you might have thought possible. The music imitates farts, burps, the sound of a nose falling into a tin basin, as well as ecstatic voices in the Kazan Cathedral.</p> <p>At the end of Gogol\u2019s story, he invites speculation on the value to a national culture of telling such a tale. A note in the full score suggests such a discussion could take place towards the end of the opera. No text is provided, but it is all too easy to imagine some Hooray Henry harrumphing from the stalls: \u201cOne of the rare cases when the opera was even sillier than the production!\u201d</p> <p><em>\u2022 The Nose</em>, with a new translation by David Pountney, is at the Royal Opera House, London WC2E, from 20 October. <a href=\"http://www.roh.org.uk/\">roh.org.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>As anyone with a vagina will tell you, there are a bunch of non-hormonal factors that affect sex drive. Show me a pair of <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=crocs&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwil28nAx9jPAhVDRyYKHRZ-CN4Q_AUICSgC&amp;biw=1277&amp;bih=686\">Crocs</a>, for example, and I\u2019ll show you one very, very dry vagina. But it makes sense that these chemical messengers that control most major bodily functions should affect our sexual function, too.</p> <p>For a long time, scientists didn\u2019t bother to find out anything about female sexual desire (presumably because <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20160630-the-enduring-enigma-of-female-desire\">they thought</a> we didn\u2019t have any). It\u2019s been <a href=\"https://www.menopause.org/for-women/sexual-health-menopause-online/sexual-problems-at-midlife/decreased-desire\">well established</a> that libido tends to decrease with age, particularly after menopause. But the handful of studies that attempted to look at changing hormonal levels and sexual desire during a period cycle have largely proved inconclusive. Until a study <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0018506X13000482\">published</a> in 2013 in the journal Hormones and Behavior in 2013 found evidence of a correlation between the two.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video element--supporting\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/video/2016/oct/12/vagina-dispatches-stopping-periods-episode-two-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/573az\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2797467\"            data-video-name=\"Vagina Dispatches episode two: stopping periods \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57fd1e88e4b05d915e423f0b\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/10/11/161010VaginaDispatchesPeriods2_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/10/11/161010VaginaDispatchesPeriods2_V3.webm\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/10/11/161010VaginaDispatchesPeriods2.m3u8\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/video/2016/oct/12/vagina-dispatches-stopping-periods-episode-two-video\">Vagina Dispatches: Stopping Periods</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Researchers at the department of psychological and brain sciences at the University of California, Santa Barbara, recruited 43 women into their study. As well as tracking their menstrual cycles and collecting daily saliva samples, the researchers gave the women a questionnaire. Each day, the women were asked \u201cHow much did you desire sexual contact yesterday?\u201d (they were given a 1\u20137 scale) in addition to behavioral questions about whether they had masturbated, had sex and, if so, who had initiated sex.</p> <p>Then, the researchers looked at the women\u2019s levels of two main hormones produced by ovaries \u2013 estrogen and progesterone. There were two main findings.<br><br>Estradiol, which is a type of estrogen, seemed to positively correlate with sexual appetite (more estradiol, and two days later, more desire) while progesterone seemed to suppress sexual desire within a day or two. Both of those hormones fluctuate over the course of a menstrual cycle, as I\u2019ve tried to show in the diagram below.</p> <p>The basic takeaway is that women are likely to feel their sex drive be at its highest during ovulation \u2013 in the middle of their menstrual cycle, about 14 days before they get their next period. Evolutionarily speaking that is a good thing, since that is also when fertility is at its highest.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Period sketch Mona Chalabi Instagram\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;instagram-media&quot; data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-version=&quot;7&quot; style=&quot; background:#FFF; border:0; border-radius:3px; box-shadow:0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width:658px; padding:0; width:99.375%; width:-webkit-calc(100% - 2px); width:calc(100% - 2px);&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;padding:8px;&quot;&gt; &lt;div style=&quot; background:#F8F8F8; line-height:0; margin-top:40px; padding:62.0833333333% 0; text-align:center; width:100%;&quot;&gt; &lt;div style=&quot; background:url(data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAACwAAAAsCAMAAAApWqozAAAABGdBTUEAALGPC/xhBQAAAAFzUkdCAK7OHOkAAAAMUExURczMzPf399fX1+bm5mzY9AMAAADiSURBVDjLvZXbEsMgCES5/P8/t9FuRVCRmU73JWlzosgSIIZURCjo/ad+EQJJB4Hv8BFt+IDpQoCx1wjOSBFhh2XssxEIYn3ulI/6MNReE07UIWJEv8UEOWDS88LY97kqyTliJKKtuYBbruAyVh5wOHiXmpi5we58Ek028czwyuQdLKPG1Bkb4NnM+VeAnfHqn1k4+GPT6uGQcvu2h2OVuIf/gWUFyy8OWEpdyZSa3aVCqpVoVvzZZ2VTnn2wU8qzVjDDetO90GSy9mVLqtgYSy231MxrY6I2gGqjrTY0L8fxCxfCBbhWrsYYAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC); display:block; height:44px; margin:0 auto -44px; position:relative; top:-22px; width:44px;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p style=&quot; margin:8px 0 0 0; padding:0 4px;&quot;&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/BLjGJM9Af8i/&quot; style=&quot; color:#000; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px; text-decoration:none; word-wrap:break-word;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Going with the flow: how periods affect sex drive.  Within a day or two, increases in progesterone seem to suppress sex drive (estrogen has the opposite effect) so women are typically horniest between days 13 and 15 of their menstrual cycle. Those days just so happen to also be the window when women are ovulating and at their most fertile.

On the site Go Ask Alice, a woman who identifies as \u201cmenses maiden\u201d <a href=\"http://goaskalice.columbia.edu/answered-questions/it-weird-feel-hornier-usual-during-my-period\">explains</a> that she often feels hornier when she\u2019s on her period and asks if she is weird. Alice (who, in reality, is a team of Columbia University health specialists) replies that it can work both ways.</p> <p>Because the chances of pregnancy are slightly lower while a woman is menstruating, that may psychologically enable some women to feel more sexual. There are other potential advantages to period sex, too \u2013 the blood can act as a lubricant, which makes penetration less painful \u2013 and if you\u2019re <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/the-gender-orgasm-gap/\">lucky enough to orgasm</a> by the end of it, that can help <a href=\"http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11199-011-0052-z\">relieve</a> cramps. On the other hand, some women might feel less aroused if they find period sex gross or if (as is my case) the pain of feeling like someone is using your uterus as a squeezy toy doesn\u2019t exactly make you feel turned on.</p> <p>Those different reactions aren\u2019t really so surprising though.

But in the end we reckoned it was better to stay home than risk getting caught by Isis trying to flee. My son has already had 20 lashes just for using a mobile in the street.</p> <p>I prepared a room in the house as a shelter with just some wheat to make bread and a few kilos of rice.</p> <p>Most locals don\u2019t have any cash because the government stopped paying its employees two years ago, and all our savings are wiped out. Pensioners are the lucky ones, they still get their pension via credit card, so our money comes from my cousin who is a retired teacher.</p> <p>People are worried about what comes after liberation.

I followed him with 10 other members of the family two weeks ago. We are all in Erbil now waiting for the liberation to go home, although our house was blown up by Isis after someone tipped them off that we had fled the city.</p> <p>My sister and many relatives are still in Mosul, they only call us after midnight for fear of being spotted using the phone by Isis militants. They are using loudspeakers in mosques and markets to urge people to join the jihad and defend their city.</p> <p>I won\u2019t go back to Mosul if Shia militias take the city, we saw what they did in other liberated cities, filling them with rancour and sectarianism.</p> </blockquote> <h2><strong>Abu Ammar, 47, from Mosul, now a refugee</strong></h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We had run through all our savings and sold lots of our belongings for very little just to cover the daily basics for my six children. Thank God, I owned my house: it would have been a real disaster if I was renting.</p> <p>My kids hadn\u2019t left the house for weeks, because they were afraid of the US airstrikes, they were bombing residential areas, close to our home. The noise is horrible, windows get broken, the whole house shakes, and people get hysterical.</p> <p>I only went out if I needed to do some shopping, and tried my best to avoid Isis militants. Mostly we borrowed wheat from a neighbour, because we couldn\u2019t afford to buy it. I\u2019m a government employee and haven\u2019t been paid for two years. The only places that are open in Mosul are petrol stations, and shops with goods from Syria.</p> <p>I was trying to find a way out for months, a job somewhere to feed the kids, but I was scared to take the route to Erbil because it is planted with mines. I finally agreed to leave with four other families one night, but at the last minute the others dropped out.</p> <p>They said they had been tipped off that Isis had set up many checkpoints along the way and might capture us. I insisted on going anyway. We walked through the night for more than six hours, with my kids frightened and begging to go back.</p> <p>We hope the army would put an end to Isis reign of terror. People are mostly hiding at home, afraid of Isis because they don\u2019t have weapons to fight them. </p> </blockquote> <h2><strong>Um Ibrahim, 50, from Mosul</strong></h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The situation is catastrophic, our life is miserable. If you have money, you can live in Mosul, otherwise, you will die of hunger and worry.</p> <p>I have six kids but only one is with me, and I have not seen my sons and grandsons for a long time. They left because of Isis\u2019s strict rules about what to wear and how to shave and lack of jobs in Mosul. I can hardly even speak to them, because Isis threaten locals for using mobile phones.</p> <p>We are terrified but can\u2019t think of fleeing, because I\u2019m here with my husband who is sick and can hardly walk.</p> <p>My daughter and her five kids are also still here; she could not leave because her husband has been detained by Isis. We thought a lot about fleeing but if we do Isis will take the house.</p> <p>Its built on rocky ground, and its hard to dig a shelter, so we are going to stay in a room near the stairs. I have bought some wheat, rice, sugar, oil, tea, beans, chickpeas and tomato paste to get through the battle.</p> <p>I\u2019m scared because Isis bases are close to us, warplanes come to bomb our area from time to time. I have seen more than three wars in Iraq but this one is going to be the worst, with other wars the fighting was not near our house and the security was good.</p> <p>We are worried that the warplanes would hit the houses round here where Isis militants are hiding now. Isis dug trenches around our district and took some of the houses as bases, and fighters are gathering on a hill behind us. In a way its like an island [of Isis militants].</p> </blockquote> <h2><strong>Abu Bashar, farmer, from Mosul</strong></h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Life in Mosul is a true hell, the city is full of beggars and widows, people are fed up of the poverty and injustice and you can\u2019t say a word about the situation. Life under Isis is terribly hard.</p> <p>There was an Isis video of captives who were gathered in an iron cage and then electrocuted. Those men were my cousins, they were killed because they are related to the commander of Mosul military operations.</p> <p>We are desperately waiting for the army to liberate the city. After Fallujah and Tikrit, people in Mosul were optimistic that they will be liberated soon as well, but nothing happened and people\u2019s savings are dwindling and they have nothing to feed their kids.</p> <p>I planted vegetables in my farm but could hardly sell anything. I left a month ago because I ran out of money.</p> <p>Isis are forcing people to vow to fight with them inside the city. Still, a tribal militia of Mosul locals has formed to fight Isis, a few of my relatives have joined to liberate their areas, take revenge for their sons who were killed by Isis and to stand in face of Shia militias if they come into the city with the army.</p> <p>People are worried about Shia militias, they have already accused Mosul locals of handing the city to Isis. I would prefer the US army to Shia militia because Americans are not sectarian.</p> </blockquote> <h2><strong>Muhammed Fawaz, 36, former security guard, from Mosul</strong></h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>These wars have stolen our lives. Locals do not want Isis after the nasty experience they have with them, they are waiting for the army to come to save them.</p> <p>I was a security policeman in a Mosul oil company and declared my repentance when Isis took over the city, but after watching my colleagues taken one after the other, I left Mosul in fear of my life and went to Turkey.</p> <p>I did not have enough money to take my family, and I used to speak to my wife regularly on the mobile but I can\u2019t reach her any more. I\u2019m very worried about my family as it has become very expensive now to get out of Mosul.</p> <p>People are so scared but they can\u2019t leave, Isis don\u2019t allow them, they have set up countless checkpoints.</p> <p>A few armed groups are formed by the families whose sons were slaughtered by Isis and they are launching daily attacks against Isis from liberated villages in Mosul. There will be no escape for Isis, they have lots of people who want revenge on them.</p> </blockquote>",

  "<h2><strong>Supersize your garden with a mirror</strong></h2> <p><strong>The tip </strong>Place mirrors around your garden to make it look bigger: the reflection gives the illusion that your plot is twice as big as it is.</p> <p><strong>The catch </strong>This theory works in principle, but position your mirrors in the wrong place, and you\u2019ll get birds flying into them, be blinded by glare from the sun, or end up reflecting that delightful view of your wheelie bins. <a href=\"http://www.kategouldgardens.com\">Garden designer Kate Gould</a> says mirrors can work in small, shady places, to bounce light about, but they\u2019re hard work: \u201cMirrors have to be spotlessly clean,\u201d she says. \u201cAs soon as they get dirty, the illusion\u2019s gone.\u201d If you insist on a reflective surface, try mirror-polished steel rather than a breakable mirror.</p> <p><strong>The alternative</strong> It may sound counterintuitive, but supersizing things (be they pots or pavers) also helps to make a small space feel larger by tricking the eye.</p> <h2><strong>Grow roses in a potato base</strong></h2> <p><strong>The tip </strong>Stick the stems of rose cuttings into a hole cut into a potato, then bury the whole thing in the ground, leaving the top section of the stem above ground. The potatoes keep the cuttings from drying out while the root system develops, and the potato slowly rots away, leaving a healthy new plant.</p> <p><strong>The catch </strong>The jury\u2019s still out on this one. There are various YouTube <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-d0DQfak9Y\">videos</a> and <a href=\"http://www.backyarddiva.ca/propagate-roses-with-potatoes/\">blogposts</a> providing anecdotal evidence that it works, but Michael Marriott, technical manager at <a href=\"http://www.davidaustinroses.co.uk\">David Austin Roses</a>, says, \u201cThe question that comes to my mind is, why put them in potatoes? Why not just put them straight in the ground?\u201d</p> <p>And rose expert Rosebie Morton of <a href=\"http://www.realflowers.co.uk\">the Real Flower Company</a> says that while the basic principle of the potato technique (namely, to keep the cuttings moist) is right, it\u2019s doubtful that it\u2019s any more beneficial than the usual propagation technique.</p> <p><strong>The alternative </strong>Morton says she gets good results from taking a 30cm rose stem, cutting off the top at an angle and recutting the bottom straight across a leaf node. Sink the stem into well-drained soil or compost at a 45-degree angle and to a depth of 12-15cm, keep moist but not wet, and leave in situ for a few months. If the cutting takes successfully, it will start to produce new top growth and can be moved once established.</p> <h2><strong>Stop slugs having a ball</strong></h2> <p><strong>The tip </strong>Copper is reputed to repel slugs, so take an old bowling ball (you\u2019ve got one of those lying around, right?), glue pennies (or 2p pieces) to it, <a href=\"http://www.houseofhawthornes.com/bowling-ball-yard-art/\">so they cover the surface</a>, and use it as a decorative garden object that doubles as a slug barrier. (And if you want it to shine, soak the coins in cola first.)</p> <p><strong>The catch </strong>Not only is it debatable how decorative this actually looks, it\u2019s also hard to be convinced by its efficacy as an anti-slug device. These days, British 1p and 2p \u201ccoppers\u201d are made from copper-plated steel, plus there is at best only patchy evidence that copper repels slugs in the first place. Dr Ian Bedford, head of entomology at <a href=\"https://www.jic.ac.uk\">the John Innes Centre</a> in Norwich, has lab-tested copper slug repellers and found no evidence that they work. And even if copper did dissuade slugs, you\u2019d need a whole bowling alley\u2019s worth of coin-covered balls to have any meaningful effect. As Bedford points out, \u201cYou put a bowling ball in the middle of your lawn, but what\u2019s to stop them eating the plants in your border?\u201d</p> <p><strong>The alternative </strong>Go ahead and make your ball; just don\u2019t expect it to deter slugs. For that, use a biological control such as <a href=\"https://www.nematodesdirect.co.uk/nemaslug/8-nemaslug\">Nemaslug</a> or a nightly slug patrol.</p> <h2><strong>Nail those blue hydrangeas</strong></h2> <p><strong>The tip </strong>Gather up those rusty nails from the back of the shed and put them in the ground around hydrangeas to correct an iron deficiency, increase acidity in the soil and, in the process, turn their blooms from pink to blue.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"102b20ca976decb95247ffd95d4103c7069b383f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/102b20ca976decb95247ffd95d4103c7069b383f/0_103_720_432/500.jpg\" alt=\"Zoe More O'Ferrall\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>The catch </strong>None of it works. Here\u2019s a mini-science lesson from <a href=\"https://www.rhs.org.uk/science/meet-the-team/guy-barter\">Guy Barter</a>, the RHS\u2019s chief horticultural adviser: \u201cAlmost all soils contain a lot of iron, but it becomes unavailable to plants \u2013 especially ericaceous ones such as rhododendrons \u2013 in alkaline soils,\u201d he says. \u201cAdding iron nails to alkaline soil merely slowly adds a very small amount of iron to the pool of chemically locked-up iron in the soil. It is soil aluminium that influences hydrangea flower colour, and aluminium is most available to plants in the acid soils associated with blue hydrangeas.\u201d</p> <p><strong>The alternative </strong>Add sulphur dust, not nails, to soil to increase acidity. Aluminium sulphate, often sold as hydrangea-blueing compound, is the best product to change flower colour in hydrangeas \u2013 try <a href=\"http://www.vitax.co.uk/home-garden/vitax-hydrangea-colourant/\">Vitax\u2019s Hydrangea Colourant</a>. Plants with iron deficiency suffer yellowing patches between the veins. Barter recommends treating them with chelated iron, an organic compound that prevents lock-up in the soil, allowing plants to absorb the iron they need.</p> <h2><strong>Dish it out to the weeds</strong></h2> <p><strong>The tip </strong>Kill weeds by spraying them with a homemade brew of vinegar, epsom salts and washing-up liquid mixed with water. This mix of ingredients commonly found in our homes is touted as safer for pets and children than shop-bought weed treatments.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"1bea8728719808f1165a22132093a0137d5274fa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1bea8728719808f1165a22132093a0137d5274fa/0_0_255_579/220.jpg\" alt=\"Illustration by Zoe More O'Ferrall\" width=\"220\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>The catch </strong>Home remedies such as this are often billed as \u201call-natural\u201d, but have you looked at the ingredients of washing-up liquid recently? Plus, it\u2019s illegal under EU law to concoct homemade weedkillers from household ingredients (what happens after Brexit is a moot point). <a href=\"http://horticulture.wsu.edu/people/chalker-scott/\">Linda Chalker-Scott</a>, associate professor at Washington State University\u2019s department of horticulture, spends her life arguing against such poor gardening advice. She points out that household products aren\u2019t formulated for this kind of use: \u201cYou have a concoction that will strip away the protective layers of plants and associated organisms, which is not a sustainable way to approach weed control,\u201d she says.</p> <p><strong>The alternative </strong>If you choose not to garden organically, buy a proprietary weedkiller and follow the instructions to the letter. Organic gardeners can control weeds with hoeing, mulching and hand-pulling. To remove weeds between paving slabs and other tricky-to-treat areas, <a href=\"https://www.gardenorganic.org.uk\">Garden Organic</a> recommends a flame weeder that uses propane or paraffin to kill weed plants and seeds.</p> <h2><strong>Make a vertical herb garden</strong></h2> <p><strong>The tip </strong>Plant herbs in glass mason jars and hang them on hooks on your kitchen wall to create an indoor herb garden. Put a layer of gravel or rocks in the base of the jar to improve drainage, then add compost and your herb plant.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/oct/08/alys-fowler-hawthorn-crap-apple-small-trees-for-small-garden\">Alys Fowler: the best trees for a small garden</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>The catch </strong>Herbs have varied requirements: some like full sun and well-drained soil, others prefer some shade and more moisture. Most will be deeply unhappy in a relatively tiny pot in a centrally heated room, and away from a light source, so watering will need to be pinpoint accurate to avoid them drying out or drowning. Even if you do manage to keep them alive and happy, they will soon grow enough to be potbound, and therefore unhappy once again. Either way, you\u2019ll end up with dead plants in pretty glass jars.</p> <p><strong>The alternative </strong>Some herbs (chives, mint and parsley, for example) will live relatively happily in a pot on a kitchen windowsill over autumn and winter, in bright but not direct sunlight, particularly if you repot them regularly. Make sure excess water can drain out into a saucer, and remove it promptly to save the plants from drowning.</p> <h2><strong>Crack seed-starting</strong></h2> <p><strong>The tip </strong>Don\u2019t throw out eggshells \u2013 use them as \u201cpots\u201d for seedlings instead (<strong>6</strong>). Cut off the top of a raw egg with a knife, rinse out the shell, make a hole in the bottom of the shell with a nail, then fill with seed compost and sow. When the plant is big enough to be transplanted, just put the whole thing in the soil.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"7a75dcece77c7076270ba0bb6593e2c7293bdb94\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7a75dcece77c7076270ba0bb6593e2c7293bdb94/63_139_1027_616/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Illustration by Zoe More O'Ferrall\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>The catch </strong>It may look cute, but this is the most fiddly and uneconomical way of sowing seeds. Have you ever tried making a hole in half an eggshell? \u201cFiddly\u201d doesn\u2019t begin to cover it. Eggshells, once empty, are fragile beasts. And if you don\u2019t clean them thoroughly (one website goes so far as to suggest boiling them, which involves more energy-consuming faffing about), they will go mouldy and smelly.</p> <p><strong>The alternative </strong>You\u2019d be better off recycling your eggshells by putting them on the compost heap. Sow your seedlings in conventional plastic trays, which can be washed and reused dozens of times (if you don\u2019t want to buy them, reuse those plastic trays that fruit and veg are often sold in). If you insist on a compostable container, buy coir pots or a paper potter (\u00a310.95, <a href=\"http://www.netherwalloptrading.uk/shop/original-paper-potter/\">netherwalloptrading.uk</a>), and fashion pots from toilet rolls or newspaper.</p>",
  "<p>Executions in Florida and the fate of prisoners on death row will remain on hold after a resounding ruling on Friday from the state\u2019s highest court that the death penalty there is unconstitutional.</p> <p>Capital punishment has been in limbo in the state since a US supreme court <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jan/12/supreme-court-rules-florida-judge-only-death-penalty-sentencing-unconstitutional-capital-punishment-debate\">decision</a> in January 2016 that Florida\u2019s system was unconstitutional because judges had the final say on the death sentence, whereas that power should be held by juries.</p> <p>Now Florida\u2019s supreme court has ruled that a fix that lawmakers attempted in the spring is also unconstitutional.</p> <p>The Florida justices ruled that death sentences cannot be handed down by a jury deciding in the majority, which was the essence of state lawmakers\u2019 spring fix \u2013 the jury must agree unanimously.</p> <p>The legislature\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.mypalmbeachpost.com/news/news/state-regional-govt-politics/could-sentences-of-all-390-on-florida-death-row-be/nrHnb/\">rewriting </a>of the law in May to allow juries to award the death penalty on the basis of a 10-to-2 decision was ruled unconstitutional by the state\u2019s court.</p> <p>Experts declared the decision a major blow to Florida\u2019s death penalty and a further weakening of America\u2019s fraying ties to the principle of capital punishment.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m happy. This is an important ruling. My first reaction is relief that it\u2019s going to require a unanimous decision from a jury to make the ultimate determination of whether or not someone should die,\u201d said Rob Smith, director of the Fair Punishment Project at Harvard law school.</p> <p>The legislature will now be forced back to the drawing board if it wants to rewrite the law again and keep the death penalty going in Florida.</p> <p>It is believed lawmakers will not go into a session where this can happen until next spring, meaning that death sentences, and probably also executions, will continue to be on hold, Smith said.</p> <p>\u201cThis decision confirms everything that we have known for years about the broken death penalty system in Florida,\u201d said Smith. \u201cWhat hits hard is realizing how many millions of dollars have been wasted across Florida for years and how much suffering has been caused to the families of victims who have to come to court over and over again because of overzealous prosecutors who knew that the statute was probably unconstitutional.\u201d</p> <p>The Florida supreme court issued two rulings at the same time on Friday. One held that the rewriting of the statute to allow a majority jury ruling on death was unconstitutional and the second ordered a new sentencing hearing for Timothy Hurst, the condemned murderer at the center of the legal row. </p> <p>Hurst, who has been on Florida\u2019s death row since 2000, could have his sentence commuted to life in prison. The state supreme court has not yet explained whether its ruling will apply to the almost 400 inmates already on Florida\u2019s death row, or only to future cases.</p> <p>Florida\u2019s governor, Rick Scott, declined to comment while he digested the ruling, a statement from his office said.</p> <p>\u201cAll current death sentences in Florida should be commuted to life in prison and this should have been done immediately after the US Supreme Court ruled that Florida\u2019s death penalty statute was unconstitutional in January, 2016,\u201d Mary Anne Franks, professor of law at the University of Miami school of law, wrote to the Guardian in an email.</p> <p>The ruling will be a blow to the already-embattled Florida attorney general, Pam Bondi \u2013 who is caught up in a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/07/donald-trump-donation-pam-bondi-florida-attorney-general\">scandal</a> over whether her decision not to investigate the now-defunct Trump University was in any way connected to presidential candidate Donald Trump\u2019s donation to her re-election campaign.</p> <p>Rob Smith said he believed many given the death sentence in Florida were among \u201cthe most impaired, most broken and most vulnerable\u201d members of society.</p> <p>\u201cAnd yet Florida declares that the death penalty is supposed to be reserved for the worst of the worst,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Florida had been unusual in its system of allowing a judge to decide the death sentence. The jury could make a recommendation but the judge had the final say. The rewriting of the statute in May to change the decision to one made by a jury \u2013 but allowing a majority decision \u2013 also kept Florida among a small minority of states. Most that still have the death penalty require a unanimous jury decision on death.</p> <p>Alabama has the majority jury system but recently <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.al.com/news/birmingham/index.ssf/2016/06/alabama_appeals_court_death_se.html%27\">declared </a>that it is constitutional.

A Home Office spokesman said: \u201cWork is continuing on both sides of the Channel to ensure this happens as a matter of urgency.\u201d </p> <p>He said the home secretary, Amber Rudd, had made it \u201ccrystal clear\u201d to the French interior minister that she intended to \u201ctransfer as many minors as possible\u201d who are eligible under the rules.</p> <p>Although asylum seekers usually have to make a claim for protection in the first safe country they reach, the rules for children mean their claim can be transferred if they have family members living somewhere else. </p> <p>Officials are working against the clock to complete the process as fears grow of a mass disappearance of children ahead of the planned eviction and demolition. There are also fears those children who are not eligible to seek asylum in Britain will be particularly vulnerable once the authorities move in and raze the camp.</p> <p>With local councils set to absorb the pressures of the influx of unaccompanied children, the chairman of the Local Government Association\u2019s asylum, refugee and migration task group, David Simmonds, said councils will \u201crequire long-term funding arrangements from government so that the commitment to support those children starting a new life in the UK is properly funded\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f7e923cd57d3b7aa76a0cb4ccd4b3d45041578ab\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f7e923cd57d3b7aa76a0cb4ccd4b3d45041578ab/0_97_2899_1740/1000.jpg\" alt=\"People gather inside the camp in Calais\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">People gather inside the camp in Calais.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Denis Charlet/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Simmonds said taking on children who had been living in the squalor of the camp could put increased pressure on stretched local authority resources. \u201cThose arriving from the Calais camp will require care and support packages directly from councils and their partners,\u201d he said. </p> <p>\u201cFor those children relocated with existing family living in the UK, councils will still want to be assured that arrangements put in place can meet the child\u2019s needs and that they are safe and well. Many will have also experienced horrendous conditions within and since fleeing their country of origin, so councils will want to ensure they are able to settle into communities as quickly and easily as possible with ongoing support made available when they need it.\u201d</p> <p>The news of the arrival of child refugees comes as reports emerged of French police stripping people of their shoes and phones in an apparent move to keep them in the camp before their official eviction. According to a recording secured by the Independent, refugees who had ventured just outside the confines of camp, which has become known as \u201cthe Jungle\u201d, were stopped by police. The French officers demanded their shoes and forced them to walk back into the camp.</p> <p>A report published in the summer by the Bar Human Rights Committee revealed French authorities regularly took personal items, including phones, from the refugees in the camp. </p> <p>Gr\u00e1inne Mellon, co-author of the BHRC report, told the Independent: \u201cWe found evidence of what appeared to be fairly routine acts of violence in the camp, including shoes being removed and phones being confiscated, corroborated by a number of different sources. The confiscation of these items is a breach of criminal law and against all policing codes and ethics, but in addition to that and more worryingly it feeds into this sense in the camps that the residents don\u2019t have any rights.\u201d</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/ken-loach\">Ken Loach</a> sits with his hands clutching his chair for dear life, his head shrinking into his shoulders, a skinny question mark of a man. Never did a man appear so diffident. And then he opens his mouth.</p> <p>Loach has spent the past half-century making films that shake with anger, and is just about to release his angriest yet. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/may/12/i-daniel-blake-ken-loachs-welfare-state-polemic-is-blunt-dignified-and-brutally-moving\">I, Daniel Blake</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/may/22/ken-loach-cannes-2016-palme-dor-win-i-daniel-blake\">winner of the Palme d\u2019Or at the 2016 Cannes film festival</a>, is about a man broken by the British benefits system. His doctor says he is too sick to work after a near-fatal heart attack, but the Department for Work and Pensions decides he is not entitled to sickness benefit. Blake finds himself trapped in a downward spiral after his jobseeker\u2019s allowance is suspended, because he is thought not to be trying hard enough to find the work he is unfit to do. The film is so spare and spartan, it could be a parable. It is also immensely moving \u2013 particularly a scene in a food bank, when a young mother Blake has befriended breaks down in a manner that borders on the feral.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/oct/21/meet-the-real-daniel-blakes-ken-loach-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/58fjn\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2826140\"            data-video-name=\"Meet the real Daniel Blakes \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-5809eecde4b005f21833bc43\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/10/21/161021RealLifeDanielBlake_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/10/21/161021RealLifeDanielBlake.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11979151&amp;format=video/webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/oct/21/meet-the-real-daniel-blakes-ken-loach-video\">Meet the real Daniel Blakes</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>\u201cAngry? Mmmmmmm,\u201d Loach says so quietly it barely registers. He talks about the people he and his regular writer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/paul-laverty\">Paul Laverty</a> met while doing their research: the young lad with nothing in his fridge who hadn\u2019t eaten properly for three days; the woman ashamed of attending food banks; the man told to queue for a casual shift at 5.30am, then sent home an hour later because he wasn\u2019t needed. \u201cThat constant humiliation to survive. If you\u2019re <em>not</em> angry about it, what kind of person are you?\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3fe9951636ac5a4b81d709ce5b3f50ad1e9152c2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3fe9951636ac5a4b81d709ce5b3f50ad1e9152c2/0_0_4238_3156/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Still from film Cathy Come Home, showing Sean King as Sean, Ray Brooks as Reg, Stephen King as Stephen and Carol White as Cathy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"745\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Carol White as the heroine of Loach\u2019s 1966 film Cathy Come Home.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dave Pickthorne/BBC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>We are in a cafe close to his office in Soho, London. Loach orders coffee and croissants. Meekly, of course, but his meekness is deceptive: even when ordering coffee, he knows exactly what he wants. \u201cI\u2019ll have a little glass of tap water, please, and a tiny drop of cold milk, thank you. Yes,\u201d he continues, \u201cwe met so many people who had been humiliated and destroyed and lost all sense of being able to hold their own in the world.\u201d</p> <p>In many ways, I, Daniel Blake can be seen as a companion piece to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/sep/04/cathy-come-home-rings-true\">Cathy Come Home</a>, Loach\u2019s seminal 1966 film about a young family\u2019s descent into homelessness, which resulted in a parliamentary debate and raised public awareness of homelessness. But while Cathy led to real social change, Loach predicts people will not be outraged by Daniel: they will accept it as normal that a man should be cheated out of benefits by the state, or a young single mother has to move from London to Newcastle to find herself a scrap of a home.</p> <p>Whose world would he rather share: Cathy\u2019s or Daniel\u2019s? \u201cThat\u2019s a complicated question. In the world of Cathy, we still had the main elements of the welfare state in place, even though they were being eroded. People were still employed directly by the health service. We still owned the gas, the electric, the water, the railways. As a world to live in, Cathy\u2019s was more congenial, with a stronger sense of social responsibility. When she was shown as homeless, people were angry about it. Now society is nowhere near as cohesive. The consequences of Thatcher and Blair have eroded the sense that we are responsible for each other, that we are our brothers\u2019 and sisters\u2019 keeper. So in that sense I prefer the days of Cathy.\u201d</p> <p>In the 60s and 70s, Loach belonged to small leftist groups: the Socialist Labour League (forerunner of the <a href=\"http://wrp.org.uk/\">Workers Revolutionary Party</a>), the <a href=\"http://www.internationalsocialist.org/\">International Socialists</a>, the International Marxist Group, all critical of both western capitalism and the Stalinism of the Soviet Union. They\u2019d swot up on Marxism, debate it intensely and tell anybody who\u2019d listen that capitalism was unsustainable: it would devour itself, and the working classes in the process. But it was all guesswork. At the time, the ready availability of jobs and a relatively well-funded welfare state suggested capitalism was actually doing just dandy.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>People are getting the sense that the world cannot be sustained like this, that we really have to change things now</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It\u2019s only now, Loach says, that the collapse they predicted is coming to pass. \u201cWe said that every crisis means more demands on the working class, more exploitation, but we were saying it in the abstract. People weren\u2019t imagining zero-hours contracts, agency work, food banks. Who would have thought in the 60s that it would be acceptable and normal to starve unless you got charity food? It\u2019s grotesque that we now accept this.\u201d</p> <p>He gives a brilliantly simple explanation as to why capitalism will ultimately fail society, particularly in a globalised world: \u201cEach corporation is trying to get more sales through lower prices, therefore profits reduce, therefore they have to find the cheapest labour wherever it is, therefore capital can never be stable.\u201d</p> <p>Despite everything, Loach is an optimist. \u201cI think people are getting the sense that the world cannot be sustained like this,\u201d he says. \u201cThe impulse behind <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/syriza\">Syriza</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/podemos\">Podemos</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/bernie-sanders\">Bernie Sanders</a> in the US and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/jeremy-corbyn\">Jeremy Corbyn</a> is that another world is possible. There is a sense that we really have to change things now.\u201d</p> <p>***</p> <p>I first interviewed Loach 23 years ago, soon after he made the film <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnkJmYo6sjE\">Raining Stones</a>, written by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2011/may/24/my-tv-hero-jim-allen\">Jim Allen</a> (with whom he collaborated until he died in 1999), about a man who cannot afford to buy his daughter a communion dress and involves himself disastrously with loan sharks. It was classic Loach territory: exploitation, the indignity of unemployment, the resilience and humour of working-class people. I remember walking through Soho and Loach stopping to buy us a punnet of strawberries from a market stall, while telling me pity was a rightwing construct: the answer to all setbacks, as <a href=\"http://www.aflcio.org/About/Our-History/Key-People-in-Labor-History/Joe-Hill-1879-1915\">the great American trade unionist Joe Hill</a> said, is, \u201cDon\u2019t mourn, organise!\u201d</p> <p>I recently watched <a href=\"http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/557251/\">The Big Flame</a>, Loach\u2019s 1969 TV film about 10,000 Liverpool dockers staging a work-in. In the film, one docker strums the song <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8Kxq9uFDes\">Joe Hill</a> on his guitar, while another explains that Hill\u2019s famous line was delivered when he was facing the firing squad after being framed for murder. Today, Loach argues that the struggle to organise is made tougher by the fact that so many workers are technically self-employed and not part of a collective. Again, he quotes Joe Hill at me.</p> <p>Critics say Loach\u2019s weakness is that he has never changed: he is still delivering the same Marxist sermon he was half a century ago. His fans argue that this is his strength. Loach himself, now an unlikely 80 years old, would ask why on earth he should change when the system remains the same.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bf1b6e516bc61cbb4c3fa70acaf2e6ba898b9527\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bf1b6e516bc61cbb4c3fa70acaf2e6ba898b9527/0_0_2712_1799/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Still from Ken Loach's 2016 film I, Daniel Blake, showing Briana Shann, Hayley Squires, Dave Johns, Dylan McKiernan\" width=\"1000\" height=\"663\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Loach\u2019s latest film, I, Daniel Blake: \u2018I prefer the days of Cathy,\u2019 he says.

At school, he represented the Tories in a mock election. \u201cI don\u2019t think too much should be made of that,\u201d he says. I had assumed he was playing devil\u2019s advocate, or it was just a passing teenage whim, but no, he says: these were the values with which he was brought up. Loach\u2019s father was an electrician who became a foreman in his factory in Nuneaton \u2013 a classic working-class Tory, he says. His mother was a hairdresser. When Loach\u2019s father was asked to join the staff and become a manager, he refused, because it would mean a monthly payment into the bank rather than weekly cash in a brown envelope. (He hated the idea of being in debt, and always wanted money to hand.) He was a bright, shrewd man who had passed the grammar school exam but didn\u2019t go, because his mother couldn\u2019t afford the uniform. He read books about the great barristers and dreamed of a future in law for his son.</p> <p>Young Kenneth was clever and ambitious. He went to grammar school (a form of education he despises because it plucks a few working-class kids out of their lives to \u201csucceed\u201d, leaving the others to fail) and had a voracious appetite for learning. He would sneak-read Shakespeare under the sheets when the bedroom light was supposed to be out. The family took the rightwing Daily Express, and Loach would read it cover to cover, never questioning its values. As far as he was concerned, it simply reflected the world. \u201cI adopted the Tories like you adopt a team,\u201d he says, embarrassed. How long did he adopt them for? \u201cProbably until I was 19, when I went into the RAF.\u201d</p> <p>After the air force, he went to Oxford University to study law. He became active in the drama society, performed sketches with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/dudley-moore\">Dudley Moore</a>, started to direct, slacked on the academic front, graduated with a third and decided his future lay in the theatre. His father was devastated.</p> <p>Loach had always wanted to act. \u201cI had that bee in my bonnet since I was 15.\u201d Did he have a role model? \u201cI remember seeing an old actor called <a href=\"http://www.screenonline.org.uk/people/id/458331/\">Marius Goring</a> play Richard III, and thinking that was the bee\u2019s knees. There were probably echoes of that in what I tried to do.\u201d Was he any good? He giggles. \u201cI couldn\u2019t possibly say. Well, I got away with it.\u201d Even today, you sense he believes he could have been a contender. His wife Lesley, usually loyal beyond the call of duty, has told me he was a hopeless ham, the kind of actor he would be least likely to cast in his own films. Is there a bit of him that prickles at this? \u201cOf course. But who knows?\u201d</p> <p>He got a job as assistant director at Northampton rep. \u201cI thought I could still play a part or two, but the director obviously had no confidence in me. I didn\u2019t even get a part in the pantomime, so I thought maybe I\u2019d better stick to directing.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b73e90ca488e23506aea0bff1cac95f7c9f551c4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b73e90ca488e23506aea0bff1cac95f7c9f551c4/0_0_3096_2062/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Director Ken Loach with Eric Cantona on the set of the 2009 film Looking For Eric.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With Eric Cantona on the set of 2009\u2019s Looking For Eric.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Everett Collection/Rex Features</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In 1963, he moved to the BBC as a trainee director and before long was directing the police drama <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWflrCrwUSw\">Z-Cars</a>.

I think he thought I didn\u2019t know what I was talking about. To know what you were talking about, you had to work where he had, and have dealt with the people he dealt with, and faced the rigours of just not seeing the sunlight.\u201d</p> <p>Who took most pride in his achievements, his mother or father? \u201cI think they shared a pride. He wouldn\u2019t go in for praise, but he\u2019d acknowledge it had happened. He\u2019s a working man from the West Midlands. People are quite reserved. There were no metropolitan hugs in the 1950s, I\u2019ll tell you!\u201d</p> <p>Although his work on Z-Cars was praised for its new dirty realism (accepting that the police could be prejudiced or even corrupt), Loach didn\u2019t feel it was real enough, so he went back to first principles and analysed the films he most admired: the Czech new wave and the Italian neorealists. \u201cIn these films, people are just being, not performing. And what I was doing was getting performances I didn\u2019t believe. So I learned from my mistakes.\u201d</p> <p>He took his craft to pieces and rebuilt it, borrowing some techniques (using natural light whenever possible and casting nonprofessional actors alongside professionals) and establishing new ones of his own (shooting chronologically; feeding the storyline to actors bit by bit, so their reactions are real; combining improvised shots with closely scripted ones). It is perhaps this level of realism that distinguishes his films more than anything: Cathy, wonderfully played by <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0924576/\">Carol White</a>, looks shocked when her child is taken away because the actor was; ditto <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZB0i0NzOe0\">the boy who cries in Kes when he is caned</a> on the hand.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"12e2fa910bfff8ae422b56050315c143d3133982\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/12e2fa910bfff8ae422b56050315c143d3133982/0_155_2096_1257/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Actor David Bradley holding a kestrel in Ken Loach's 1969 film Kes\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">David Bradley in 1969\u2019s Kes.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Everett/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>From the mid-60s to the end of that decade, everything Loach did created headlines and set agendas. It wasn\u2019t just that the films looked and felt different; the subject matter was radical, too. <a href=\"http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/440997/\">Up The Junction</a> started a debate about backstreet abortions, The Big Flame about workers\u2019 rights and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pafCuwBBVM8\">Three Clear Sundays</a> about the death penalty. This run culminated in 1969 with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/kes\">Kes</a>, the film based on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/mar/20/barry-hines-author-behind-kes-dies-kestrel-for-knave\">the Hines novel</a> about a working-class boy whose love for a kestrel brings him out of his shell. Loach\u2019s film is as unsentimental as it is heartwrenching, as brutal as it is beautiful, and features one of the funniest football scenes in the history of cinema when the games teacher, played by Brian Glover and kitted out in a Bobby Charlton top, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9nDHupVqVw\">insists on taking a penalty that never was</a>.</p> <p>But in 1971 Loach\u2019s world collapsed. He was driving on the outside lane of the M1 when a car on the inside lane lost a wheel, crashed into Loach and pushed his car into the upright of a bridge. His five-year-old son Nicholas was killed, Lesley\u2019s grandmother also died, and Lesley was left fighting for her life. Loach didn\u2019t work again for more than a year. \u201cWe lost a child, and then your whole personal\u2026 Everything you have about you is concentrated on that loss. So you don\u2019t have the emotional space or strength to do anything other than just grieve, and that\u2019s a long process.\u201d</p> <p>His sentences become stubbly and broken when he talks about it. Loach will refer to his son or his child, but tends not to use his name. Does he find it difficult to say? \u201cWell, I always have, yes... Nicholas.\u201d He says the name so quickly, you could miss it. \u201cBecause the wound is so deep. And I think that\u2019s part of the problem. We probably have never been able to grieve and resolve things. I think now there are processes that would encourage you to express your grief and to reach some reconciliation with it. At the time we didn\u2019t, despite trying to be clever about other people\u2019s situations. At one level we were conscious that it had to happen, and at another we were too wounded to begin it.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1d0ba811a58d21273a64627a9ed647c8d8c7a753\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1d0ba811a58d21273a64627a9ed647c8d8c7a753/0_0_4957_3926/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Film director Ken Loach on set in 1980\" width=\"1000\" height=\"792\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Loach on set in 1980.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Farrell/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When he returned to work, it was in an unlikely way, <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0388278/\">adapting Chekhov\u2019s short story A Misfortune for television</a>. He went on to make the epic TV series <a href=\"http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/467647/\">Days Of Hope</a>, covering the period between the first world war and <a href=\"https://socialistworker.co.uk/art/8565/The+1926+general+strike%3A+nine+days+of+hope\">the national strike of 1926</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDpBuFqWeSs\">The Price Of Coal</a>, about a mining disaster; but his film career floundered. Even the most devoted fan found 1981\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082678/?ref_=tt_rec_tti\">Looks &amp; Smiles</a> painfully miserable, and Loach says he made a mess of the only other film he made in the 80s, <a href=\"http://www.timeout.com/london/film/fatherland\">Fatherland</a>.</p> <p>As well as a loss of confidence, there was another problem: Loach kept getting banned. In 1983 he made <a href=\"http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/1417974/\">Questions Of Leadership</a>, a series that asked whether workers were being betrayed by trade union officials, but Channel 4, which had commissioned it, refused to broadcast it, saying it was unbalanced. His 1984 film <a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/programmes/which-side-are-you-on\">Which Side Are You On?</a>, about striking miners\u2019 songs and poems, made for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2009/sep/13/melvyn-bragg-south-bank-show\">Melvyn Bragg\u2019s South Bank Show</a>, was shelved by London Weekend Television for being too political. In 1987, his production of Jim Allen\u2019s play <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1999/apr/23/fiachragibbons\">Perdition</a>, which examined an alleged collaboration between Zionist leaders and the Nazis, was cancelled by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/max-stafford-clark\">Max Stafford-Clark</a> at the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/royal-court-theatre\">Royal Court theatre</a> just 36 hours before opening night. By the late 80s, he couldn\u2019t get anything commissioned, let alone shown, for love nor money. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jun/14/ken-loach-comes-clean-about-his-mcdonalds-job\">To his eternal shame</a>, he made <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjwa8B0g6TI\">a commercial for McDonald\u2019s</a>.</p> <p>In the recent television documentary <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jun/05/versus-life-and-films-ken-loach-documentary-review\">Versus: The Life And Films Of Ken Loach</a>, the film-maker comes across as mild and lovable \u2013 until he talks about those who betrayed him. On screen, he describes Stafford-Clark as a coward, and the ferocity of the attack is shocking.</p> <p>You\u2019re not afraid of making enemies, are you, I ask. It depends, he says. \u201cMy mum was a peacemaker, and in personal things I tend to do that, because I can\u2019t deal with personal conflict. I find that horrible.\u201d Loach and Lesley have four surviving children, two of whom \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/mar/31/jim-loach-oranges-and-sunshine\">Jim</a> and <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2bd1bcfcd3\">Emma</a> \u2013 are also film-makers. \u201cI couldn\u2019t argue with the people you rely on and trust, and care for, and cherish, because the cost would be too great. But step outside that and face the world, <em>come on</em>!\u201d</p> <p>I rephrase my earlier question: is he afraid of making enemies in public life and politics? \u201cNo, because they <em>are</em> enemies. When we did those films back in the 80s, the rightwing trade unionists and the rightwing Labourites and the people who joined them were out to destroy what I\u2019d done. They did destroy what I\u2019d done.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"252b6f026eeed40cd89b37e7bb8b64a70e434644\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/252b6f026eeed40cd89b37e7bb8b64a70e434644/0_0_6022_3413/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Still from Ken Loach film The Wind That Shakes The Barley\" width=\"1000\" height=\"567\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Wind That Shakes The Barley, winner of the 2006 Palme d\u2019Or.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Snap Stills/Rex</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Does he ever feel he\u2019s too unforgiving? \u201cNo, because you\u2019ve got to be clear it\u2019s not personal, but if somebody consciously sabotages something because they are afraid of the consequences, that is unforgivable. And particularly in our business. If you\u2019re a politician, you can see there might be times when, to secure the greater good, you have to take a backwards step. That is a matter of tactics. But for people who make films or who are journalists, our function is to say these are the underlying ideas and principles. And this is what people have got to be judged on. That is at the heart of the play that Max Stafford-Clark killed, and was at the heart of the documentaries that the Labourite rightwingers censored.\u201d</p> <p>Did he ever think his career was over? \u201cYes. Towards the end of the 80s, I started to think about going back to the law, even though I had no qualifications and a very bad degree. I just didn\u2019t know what to do. Teaching film, I suppose. We had to take out loans, living a bit hand-to-mouth.\u201d He stops, apologetically. \u201cI mean, it was middle-class poverty! We were still in a house. But I couldn\u2019t see where I fitted in.\u201d</p> <p>***</p> <p>Next day, we meet again, this time at Loach\u2019s office. At the top of the narrow stairs is a framed poster for <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0099768/\">Hidden Agenda</a>, the 1990 film about state terrorism in Northern Ireland that heralded his comeback. Naturally, it caused a stink.

It was also the first Loach film produced by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/rebecca-o-brien\">Rebecca O\u2019Brien</a>, and the two have worked together ever since.</p> <p>He has continued to make film after film since then, winning award after award. At the heart of every movie, all made on small budgets and drawing on a hotchpotch of British and European money, there has been a cause; from the <a href=\"https://membership.theguardian.com/membership-content?referringContent=news/2016/jul/15/looking-back-the-spanish-civil-war&amp;membershipAccess=PaidMembersOnly\">Spanish civil war</a> (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/observer/screen/story/0,6903,595331,00.html\">Land And Freedom</a>) to the Contra insurgency against the Sandinistas in Nicaragua (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2005/apr/06/1\">Carla\u2019s Song</a>), from trade union rights in the US (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2001/apr/27/1\">Bread And Roses</a>: the only film he has made in North America) to Ireland\u2019s war of independence (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2006/jun/23/3\">The Wind That Shakes The Barley</a>) and, most of all, the struggle for work, dignity and justice (<a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0107920/\">Raining Stones</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/sweet-sixteen\">Sweet Sixteen</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/tvandradioblog/2007/sep/25/lastnightstvitsafreeworl\">It\u2019s A Free World</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/1998/nov/08/features.review7\">My Name Is Joe</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/jun/03/angels-share-ken-loach-review\">The Angels\u2019 Share \u2013 basically all of them</a>).

He prefers his actors to come with no baggage: the less familiar the face, the more believable the story. The one celebrity he has cast is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/eric-cantona\">Eric Cantona</a>, the eponymous hero of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/jun/12/film-review-looking-for-eric-cantona-ken-loach\">Looking For Eric</a>, but Loach made the exception because Cantona plays himself in a one-off foray into magic realism.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"194115de9608fbba1a922447c2bc5587acfb5356\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/194115de9608fbba1a922447c2bc5587acfb5356/947_91_2262_1956/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Film director Ken Loach with wife Lesley Ashton (on left) and producer Rebecca O\u2019Brien at the 2010 Cannes film festival\" width=\"1000\" height=\"865\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With wife Lesley (on left) and producer Rebecca O\u2019Brien at the 2010 Cannes film festival.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Buckner/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Since Jim Allen\u2019s death, most of Loach\u2019s films have been written by Paul Laverty. At the occasional parties Loach reluctantly hosts (his 70th birthday, his 80th earlier this year), old collaborators such as producer Tony Garnett and writer Roger Smith mingle with newer ones. As he says, he doesn\u2019t fall out with friends and family easily.</p> <p>On the mantelpiece in the office is a monobrowed mask of Cantona, a picture of the three-legged dog that features in I, Daniel Blake, and the two Palme d\u2019Ors he has won (the first was for The Wind That Shakes The Barley). Above one is a red dog collar. I ask what it is. Loach giggles: \u201cThat\u2019s the Palme Dog, an award given to the most impressive dog in a film. We were given a lifetime achievement award for three-legged dogs.\u201d</p> <p>Now I\u2019m staring at <a href=\"http://www.movpins.com/big/MV5BMTI3MjA0NDA1NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTU1NDgwMw/ricky-tomlinson-in-riff-raff-%281991%29.jpg\">a photograph of a naked</a> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/ricky-tomlinson\">Ricky Tomlinson</a> in <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0100491/\">Riff-Raff</a>, playing a builder who has just treated himself to a shower in a posh apartment block he is working on. There always seems to come a point in a Loach film where a character sticks two fingers up at authority \u2013 whether in the form of Tomlinson\u2019s bottom or Daniel Blake graffiti-ing his name on the jobcentre wall. \u201cIt\u2019s a toss-up which is the more potent symbol of resistance,\u201d Loach says. \u201cRicky Tomlinson\u2019s backside or Daniel\u2019s graffiti? People fight back. People are not docile victims. In rightwing art, films, books, whatever, they like the poor as victims, because that is the politics of charity \u2013 the lady of the manor going around on Christmas. \u2018The poor are always with us, the order of society is fixed and we have to be kind to the poor.\u2019 Leftwing politics argues that poverty is a by-product of class society, and that people will resist it, and it is that resistance we want to value, to show, to celebrate. So Daniel Blake is not a supplicant, he\u2019s a man of dignity.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>First thing in the morning, I feel about 85.

(After 30 years as a Labour party member, he left in disgust at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/tonyblair\">Tony Blair</a>.)

  "<p>At 25, Sadeq Abdullah Saleh al-Guraizea was close to finishing his education and looking forward to the future.  <br></p> <p>In August, just three months before the end of his master\u2019s degree in IT at Limkokwing University in Malaysia, the English-speaking Yemeni had returned home to the country\u2019s rebel-held capital, Sana\u2019a, to marry. The wedding 10 days later coincided with the resumption of airstrikes by Saudi Arabia, which led to the closure of the airport, forcing him to stay longer than expected. <br></p> <p>Last Saturday, still in Sana\u2019a, he accompanied his 56-year-old father, Abdullah, a security officer, to the city\u2019s al-Sala al-Kubra community hall for the funeral ceremony of a well-known sheikh, the father of the Houthi-led government\u2019s interior minister, Galal al-Rawishan.

  "<p>First a thought. Now that Landon Donovan has shaken off the proverbial dust from his Galaxy uniform and returned to action, the league should probably consider removing his name from the MVP award. After saying goodbye to the game in 2014, MLS respectfully renamed it in his honor, but now after his return it seems slightly odd for a trophy to be named after a player who, despite his great success in the past, is probably not better than the candidates who might receive it.</p> <p>Namesake notwithstanding, Major League Soccer\u2019s MVP award is one of my favorite prizes in the world of soccer just because the nominees and winners continue to be so wonderfully diverse. Since the league\u2019s first ever season in 1996 when Carlos Valderrama won it with Tampa Bay Mutiny, we have had 10 different nationalities win the award. From Bolivia\u2019s Marco Etcheverry (DC United) to last year\u2019s first ever Italian winner in Sebastian Giovinco, it\u2019s refreshing to see just how many different nationalities represent the most sought after individual award in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/15/mls-latinos-hispanic-community-dna\">most diverse professional sports league in North America</a>.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/oct/07/new-york-city-fc-mls-necaxa-mexico\">New York City FC head to Mexico for 'really special' date with Necaxa</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As we discuss this year\u2019s finalists most likely to appear on the three-man ballot at the beginning of November, one thing is abundantly clear: this is a two-horse race. The incomparable Giovinco will never stop impressing us and 16 goals and 13 assists for the season so far are nothing short of superlative. But I just don\u2019t think the award will be given to a player who has been out of action <a href=\"http://www.espnfc.com/toronto-fc/story/2940247/toronto-fc-forward-sebastian-giovinco-out-for-a-month-with-double-strain\">since late August</a> and missed five matches in the process. Sacha Kljestan is an assist machine (17) and we should not disregard the value he offers to both the Red Bulls and the US national team as the 31-year-old midfielder was one of the only shining points from USA\u2019s draw with New Zealand earlier this week. </p> <p>This award, however, loves forwards (see Giovinco and Robbie Keane, the last two winners) and as the season winds down there are only two candidates who are worthy of the prize. As we wind down the regular season, these two stars know there is something much bigger at stake than an individual honor. Both teams, from the same city, are still looking to win the conference and indeed the Cup \u2013 and the fact that they represent a fresh rivalry make this debate that much more enticing. And in keeping with the trophy\u2019s diverse spirit, they are a south Londoner whose father was one of the greatest strikers in the English game and a pint-sized player from Northern Spain who is lovingly referred to as El Guaje.</p> <h2>Bradley Wright-Phillips, New York Red Bulls</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Bradley Wright-Phillips\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;instagram-media&quot; data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-version=&quot;7&quot; style=&quot; background:#FFF; border:0; border-radius:3px; box-shadow:0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width:658px; padding:0; width:99.375%; width:-webkit-calc(100% - 2px); width:calc(100% - 2px);&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;padding:8px;&quot;&gt; &lt;div style=&quot; background:#F8F8F8; line-height:0; margin-top:40px; padding:33.3375% 0; text-align:center; width:100%;&quot;&gt; &lt;div style=&quot; background:url(data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAACwAAAAsCAMAAAApWqozAAAABGdBTUEAALGPC/xhBQAAAAFzUkdCAK7OHOkAAAAMUExURczMzPf399fX1+bm5mzY9AMAAADiSURBVDjLvZXbEsMgCES5/P8/t9FuRVCRmU73JWlzosgSIIZURCjo/ad+EQJJB4Hv8BFt+IDpQoCx1wjOSBFhh2XssxEIYn3ulI/6MNReE07UIWJEv8UEOWDS88LY97kqyTliJKKtuYBbruAyVh5wOHiXmpi5we58Ek028czwyuQdLKPG1Bkb4NnM+VeAnfHqn1k4+GPT6uGQcvu2h2OVuIf/gWUFyy8OWEpdyZSa3aVCqpVoVvzZZ2VTnn2wU8qzVjDDetO90GSy9mVLqtgYSy231MxrY6I2gGqjrTY0L8fxCxfCBbhWrsYYAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC); display:block; height:44px; margin:0 auto -44px; position:relative; top:-22px; width:44px;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p style=&quot; margin:8px 0 0 0; padding:0 4px;&quot;&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/BKTD5LTBoV9/&quot; style=&quot; color:#000; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px; text-decoration:none; word-wrap:break-word;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;@bdubyas_view surpassed Chris Wondolowski&amp;#39;s @mls record with 62 goals scored over 3 consecutive seasons. #dare2BWP #REDTogether #RBNY&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style=&quot; color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;&quot;&gt;A photo posted by newyorkredbulls (@newyorkredbulls) on &lt;time style=&quot; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;&quot; datetime=&quot;2016-09-13T13:29:47+00:00&quot;&gt;Sep 13, 2016 at 6:29am PDT&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;script async defer src=&quot;//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Forget about the fact that the 31-year-old Englishman is a contender for the Golden Boot award (tied with 21 goals with David Villa) and set to become the first player in MLS history to score at least 20 goals in multiple seasons. Or that back in May, while playing his 100th game for New York, Wright-Phillips scored a hat trick in the first 27 minutes against Toronto, the fastest from opening whistle in MLS history. Or that two months later, he broke another record by becoming the club\u2019s all-time leading scorer with 62 goals, surpassing the great Juan Pablo Angel. All that you need to know is that shortly after he broke yet another mark by scoring the most league goals over three seasons last month with 62 goals since 2014 (and counting), Jesse Marsch decided to give the ex-England U20 international the definitive compliment. \u201cListen, this is not taking anything away from Thierry, and obviously Thierry\u2019s the biggest name to ever play here, and is one of the best players,\u2019\u2019 Marsch <a href=\"http://www.mlssoccer.com/post/2016/09/22/once-trialist-bradley-wright-phillips-never-imagined-hed-be-great\">said in September</a>, \u201cbut I think Brad is emerging himself as the best Red Bull player, the best New York MetroStars player, or whatever you\u2019d want to call it.

Since the 7-0 atrocity in the Hudson River Derby, the Frenchman has created an atmosphere of consistency and resilience amongst the squad, a trait that is often needed with new teams entering a 20-year-old league. Players such as Jack Harrison and Steven Mendoza also have helped the cause, but make no mistake about it, this is David Villa\u2019s team and no other squad relies on single a player more. From a statistical standpoint, the numbers are impressive: 21 goals tie him with the aforementioned Wright-Phillips including four match winners. But what makes this 34-year-old World Cup winner truly one of the greatest ever strikers of his generation is his work rate. The man simply doesn\u2019t stop moving and it\u2019s this mobility and eye for goal that has enabled him to be the most dangerous striker in the league. This season Guaje hasn\u2019t gone three matches without scoring a goal: to put that into perspective, both <a href=\"http://www.espnfc.com/major-league-soccer/19/blog/post/2970782/mls-talking-points-who-will-be-named-mvp-in-2016\">Wright-Phillips and Giovinco have gone seven matches</a> or longer without scoring this year, albeit Giovinco\u2019s reasoning was also down to injury. But what this means is that Villa is the man you can bet your house on to score, no matter who you\u2019re playing against or who is supplying the chances. Before the season started <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/mar/12/david-villa-new-york-city-fc-interview\">I interviewed Villa</a> and during our conversation he stressed to me how his goalscoring is a priority for the team\u2019s success and not for personal achievement. \u201cI score for the team,\u201d he said. \u201cNot for David Villa.\u201d As NYC FC make history by entering their first ever playoff run, it cannot be forgotten that it\u2019s all mainly thanks to David Villa, the man who was born to score.</p>",

  "<p>In my loft there is a red plastic B&amp;Q toolbox filled with makeup no longer fit for purpose, but that I\u2019ll never, ever throw away. There\u2019s a dried-out Body Shop eyeliner pen that my mother put in my Christmas stocking circa 1989, which I wore with cut-off Levi\u2019s and a lycra bodysuit to Cardiff\u2019s Square club. There\u2019s a pot of Clinique face powder in an unsuitable shade of pink that I saved at least six weeks\u2019 pocket money to buy before realising it made me look embalmed. There\u2019s the Rimmel lilac eye palette I was convinced made me appear 18; the apricot lip balm bought for me by fourth form squeeze Hywel White; and the Mary Quant eyeshadows I found in a dusty box in a discount chemist and thought I\u2019d won the lottery.</p> <p>These aren\u2019t just products. This isn\u2019t just a toolbox. It\u2019s a time capsule, and everything in it takes me back to a moment \u2013 a hope, a mistake, an achievement. These unassuming bits and pieces each have their own significance and collectively add up to something as potent as any long-lost cassette compilation. They\u2019re my beauty mixtape.</p> <p>Just as we chart life\u2019s journey through music, food and places, I also attribute the same importance and sentimentality to the beauty products I saw, touched and smelled all around me. The flipping of a lid on a bottle of <a href=\"https://www.johnsonsbaby.com/lotion/johnsons-baby-lotion\">Johnson\u2019s baby lotion</a> immediately takes me back to my grandmother\u2019s living room, my clean pyjamas warming on the fireguard, the soothing hum of <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006mj2y\">Antiques Roadshow</a> and the rattle of a twin tub washer in the background. I don\u2019t just remember my first kiss: I remember the Miss Selfridge Copperknockers lipstick smeared messily over my cheeks afterwards. My first ever gig was notable not only because it was The Smiths on their last tour, but because I\u2019d stolen my mum\u2019s Rimmel lipliner and <a href=\"http://www.boots.com/en/GIVENCHY-Ysatis-Eau-de-Toilette-Spray-30ml_35269/\">Givenchy Ysatis</a> perfume for the evening.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"afc10799394d493104f6041c8b8aaeafce4fd5ea\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/afc10799394d493104f6041c8b8aaeafce4fd5ea/24_24_4853_6066/800.jpg\" alt=\"Sali Hughes\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sali Hughes models the 30s look.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Seb Winter/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A memorable beauty product transports me to my nan\u2019s backstreet curl-and-set parlour, my teenage cabin bed, a school disco or my wedding day. It\u2019s the perfumes that gave us backbone for important job interviews that stay with us, the makeup chosen for a first date, the little luxury bought with a first pay packet. These are some of the lotions, potions, creams and powders that mean the most to me.</p> <h2><strong>Chanel No 5</strong></h2> <p>In perfume-nerd circles, saying that Chanel No 5 is your favourite perfume is as obvious as declaring Shakespeare and the Mona Lisa your favourite playwright and painting. But sometimes things simply are the best; there\u2019s no use being contrary.</p> <p>Even if you don\u2019t like No 5 (and many people don\u2019t: smell is a wholly subjective business), you should still respect this remarkable 94-year-old perfume \u2013 arguably the most recognisable beauty product of all time. It was created by the extraordinarily clever and talented Russian-French <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernest_Beaux\">perfumer Ernest Beaux</a>, who made up 10 versions, numbering them one to five and 20-24. Superstitious <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coco_Chanel\">Coco Chanel</a> chose five, her lucky number. She packaged it in a typically unfussy flacon, inspired by men\u2019s toiletries and adorned with nothing more than a square label and simple type \u2013 a pretty subversive move in itself, at a time when luxury perfumes came in big, blowsy balloon-atomisers.</p> <p>The scent itself \u2013 powdery, fizzy, sexy and refined \u2013 is magnificent, whether or not it\u2019s your particular bag (impressively, it remains the world\u2019s bestselling scent).</p> <p>For me, though, it goes way beyond smell. Outside my immediate family, the most enduring relationship of my life has been with No 5. I discovered it at 12, and wore it with vintage Levi\u2019s and Smiths T-shirts at school discos; I spritzed it over my uniform when I ran away from home three years later. It moved to London with me when I had nothing but a PE bag\u2019s-worth of belongings; it lost my virginity with me, it came on my driving test. Naturally, it was a guest at my wedding. Some years later, broken, confused and tearful, I considered no other fragrance for my father\u2019s funeral.</p> <p>Nowadays, I wear No 5 perhaps once or twice a month (I love perfume too much to be monogamous); but when I have a big work day or a special occasion, I unfailingly turn to its strength, unflappable appropriateness and soft, welcoming femininity. No 5 is my backbone in a bottle, the loaded pistol in my knickers; with it, I am instantly bolstered and prepared for whatever life throws at me.</p> <h2><strong>Ponytail holders</strong></h2> <p>Does the word \u201cbobble\u201d mean anything to anyone under 35? I worry that it doesn\u2019t. For the rest of us, bobbles were hair elastics twisted into a figure 8 and clamped in the middle with metal.</p> <p>At each end was a brightly coloured plastic cube or ball, fed through the tightly-wound elastic loops to secure plaits, ponytails and bunches in place. Bobbles were sold by the pair in chemists and newsagents, on little perforated cards that were torn off a large display \u2013 just like Big D pub snacks, only without the underlying Page 3 boobs.</p> <p>My father, recently left by his wife, was tasked with doing my hair for school. He was so woefully inept that I spent each morning standing on a chair, listening to him swear as bobbles pinged, snapped and ricocheted, one after the other, out of his hands and against the kitchen wall.</p> <p>Marc Jacobs has often tried to revive the bobble \u2013 at both his own Marc label and while at Louis Vuitton \u2013 and each time, I\u2019ve been bemused at the willingness of fashion fans to pay more than \u00a3100 for something my father was ultimately forced to buy weekly from a local cash and carry.</p> <h2><strong>Mac Spice lip pencil</strong></h2> <p>When someone sits down to write the history of the nineties, they should do it in Mac Spice lip pencil. This reddy-brown liner became the Canadian-born brand\u2019s first hero product and was <em>the</em> makeup accessory of the supermodel era; it graced a hundred glossy magazine covers, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2005/oct/02/ethicalliving\">Linda Evangelista</a> was never without it (I\u2019m told she always conveniently needed to pee before shooting, then snuck on some Spice in the ladies\u2019 loo if the makeup artist had failed to). It became the look for a generation of girls like me, who thought it the height of sophistication to wear a lip pencil five shades darker than the lips it outlined.</p> <p>After making a pilgrimage to buy my first Spice in Harvey Nichols (Mac\u2019s only UK stockist at the time), and having nicked my mum\u2019s peach Covergirl lipstick, I debuted the look at a <a href=\"http:\">Salt-N-Pepa</a> concert in Newport leisure centre. The band failed to show up, but I didn\u2019t care because I felt a million dollars.</p> <p>Spice subsequently accompanied me to acid house clubs, to gigs and on dates with inappropriate men. It accessorised Kooka\u00ef hotpants, Lycra frocks from Pineapple, smiley T-shirts and red Kickers. I teamed it with fishnets, a velvet choker and a beret, and imagined myself in an <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellen_von_Unwerth\">Ellen von Unwerth</a> photoshoot. I wore it with jeans and a wide headband and felt like Bardot; with a football shirt and Adidas Gazelles, and thought I was Christy Turlington on the John Galliano catwalk.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"33477a5c3e1b47c94c421d67f79d887bcb63d364\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/33477a5c3e1b47c94c421d67f79d887bcb63d364/71_230_4836_6045/800.jpg\" alt=\"Sali Hughes 40s look\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sali Hughes models the 40s look.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Seb Winter/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I was far from any of these things, but now look back on Spice without a moment\u2019s regret: it\u2019s still an often-used part of my kit \u2013 though now I wear it with a matching lipstick and not a gloss the colour of Elastoplast.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.boots.com/en/Max-Factor-Creme-Puff-Powder-Compact_1542857/\">Max Factor Cr\u00e8me Puff</a></h2> <p>This powder is one of the first makeup items I was ever really aware of. As a tiny girl, I would sit next to my grandmother on the bus and, as we neared our destination, watch her reach into her handbag for a gilt Stratton compact housing a pan of Cr\u00e8me Puff. She\u2019d sweep the sponge over her nose and chin briskly before clicking it shut, but just long enough for the strong, sweet baby powdery-smelling particles to scent the whole top deck.</p> <p>That smell, unchanged in six decades, still does strange things to me. It smells of my nan, yes, but mostly Cr\u00e8me Puff just smells unapologetically of makeup (much as Dior lipstick does, or Bourjois powder rouge), at a time when makeup often smells of nothing at all.</p> <p>It doesn\u2019t pretend to be state-of-the-art; it\u2019s an old-fashioned formula that made Hollywood actresses Ava Gardner, Vivien Leigh and Jean Harlow appear luminous on set. It continues to do the job extremely well today (though, sadly, its nostalgia is misplaced in a Caucasian-only shade range). It\u2019s perfect with retro red lips, black flicks and falsies; its full, layerable coverage also makes it a great way to skip foundation on a more natural face \u2013 just brush over moisturiser and concealer. It\u2019s a product I use rarely, but I would never pack a full kit without it. Sometimes, it\u2019s the only thing that will do.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://www.johnsonsbaby.com/haircare/johnsons-baby-shampoo\"><strong>Johnson\u2019s baby shampoo</strong></a></h2> <p>My love of this product is merely notional, since I don\u2019t recall ever having it in the house as a child, despite two babies arriving after me. The first shampoo to use amphoteric cleansing agents, so gentle that they didn\u2019t sting the eyes, it seemed like something that would belong to the kind of family who had a purpose-decorated nursery, a wallpaper border to match the moses basket, a savings account opened and a school place lined up for a newborn. It wasn\u2019t for big chaotic families like ours, prone to bathing babies in the kitchen sink, complete with Fairy Liquid bubble beard and within reach of the bread knife.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bd334d425f18f2fa90ee44c637b0f4554e5d906b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bd334d425f18f2fa90ee44c637b0f4554e5d906b/0_349_4912_6140/800.jpg\" alt=\"Sali Hughes 50s look\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sali Hughes models the 50s look.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Seb Winter/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It was decades later that I used <a href=\"https://www.johnsonsbaby.co.uk/product/johnsons-baby-shampoo\">No More Tears</a> to wash my makeup brushes, and bought some in readiness for my first baby, when just owning the right supplies made me feel in control. Using it, I momentarily felt like a proper mum, despite the fact I was entirely at sea. I think this is why Johnson\u2019s has been deeply loved since 1936: when the disorienting, confusing, guilt-ridden, anxious (and ultimately wonderful) experience of motherhood strikes, it stands nobly by the side of the bath, as reassuringly experienced as a nanny, making you feel that everything will be OK.</p> <h2><strong>Sisley Black Rose Cream Mask</strong></h2> <p>Oh, Sisley, with your aloof, impenetrable French packaging, unknowable department store counters and your bonkers price tag that makes you inaccessible to the vast majority of beauty lovers: I wish you weren\u2019t so damned lovely. This is the mask used by supermodels after six weeks of sleepless and over-made-up skin. It\u2019s the mask reserved by makeup artists for only the best magazine covers and their gold-band clientele. It\u2019s the mask I give to women at their lowest ebb, when divorce, bereavement or illness has ravaged the body, mind and soul. Rich, luxurious, gentle and soothing, a 10-minute session with Black Rose Cream Mask is like your most well-off girlfriend taking you for a four-hour lunch and three bottles from the lower half of the wine list.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.boots.com/en/Old-Spice-Original-After-Shave-150ml_1323/\"><strong>Old Spice Original</strong></a></h2> <p>Launched in 1938, this is the smell from the backseat of my grandad\u2019s brown Austin Allegro as he drove me to Little Chef for the giddy treat of jumbo cod, chips, banana split and a free lollipop for clearing my plate. Its warm, not-too-strong but lasting spiciness is the smell of daytrips to Tenby, of candy-stripe brushed flannel sheets from the market, of a tiny metalwork room made from a cubby-hole under the stairs. It\u2019s the smell of the armchair where we took Sunday naps during the rugby, had cuddles and belly laughs in front of <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0149542/\">Victoria Wood\u2019s As Seen On TV</a>, where my grandad sat patiently as I stood on a stool behind him, tying bows, plaits, jewels and clips into his white hair.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"95c15dbddfd80abe9fc7b48b72631e5955a54eba\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/95c15dbddfd80abe9fc7b48b72631e5955a54eba/365_529_4046_5057/800.jpg\" alt=\"Sali Hughes models the 60s look.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sali Hughes models the 60s look.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Seb Winter/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Old Spice is the scent of him trying to teach me long division when everyone else had lost patience, of very gentle flirting with the checkout ladies at Kwik Save, of seemingly endless chats with every Indian and Pakistani immigrant in Blackwood to practise his beloved Urdu and Burmese, learned during his time in Burma during the second world war. It\u2019s the smell that filled a silent room whenever I asked what had happened to his friends there. Old Spice is the smell of his old shirt worn over my ra-ra dress to wash the car, of well-thumbed Robert Ludlum novels, of huge cotton handkerchiefs, of an often empty wallet, of the green zip-up anorak bought via 20 weekly payments from the Peter Craig catalogue. Old Spice was there when I first saw Madonna on Top Of The Pops, when the miners went back to work, and when we sat under blankets at military tattoos, both of us weeping like newborns. Its absence was felt acutely when I last saw his face, eyes closed in the room of a hospice; when I got married and when my babies were born.</p> <p>Unlike so many other scents of my youth, Old Spice Original remains a gorgeous fragrance in its own right. I revere it not least because, as its early ad campaign asserted, \u201cYou probably wouldn\u2019t be here if your grandfather hadn\u2019t worn Old Spice.\u201d</p> <h2>Sali Hughes\u2019 guide to four era-defining looks, decade by decade</h2> <h2><br></h2> <h2>How they wore it in the 1930s</h2> <p>The 1930s was a big decade for innovation. Elizabeth Arden invented her legendary <a href=\"http://www.elizabetharden.co.uk/elizabeth-arden-eight-hour-cream-skin-protectant-50ml/10026014.html\">Eight-Hour Cream</a> (a thick, medicinal-smelling moisturiser for the complexions of humans and the hooves of racehorses); <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Revson\">Charles Revson of Revlon</a> introduced the first opaque coloured nail lacquer and, consequently, the concept of matching lips and nails (the latter had previously been painted with transparent gloss); it was also the decade <a href=\"https://maxfactor.co.uk/heritage/the-max-factor-story\">Max Factor</a>, the man who invented the word \u201cmakeup\u201d, released Pan-Cake, the first matte, skin-coloured foundation, developed to flatter movie stars in previously challenging Technicolor. Ninety years on, it remains the world\u2019s fastest- and largest-selling single makeup to date.</p> <p>The 30s face was deliberately top-heavy: brows were shaved off and replaced with ultra-thin domes of brown pencil to make eyes appear huge, almost owl-like. Cheeks were flushed with creme rouge worn so high as to practically skim the undereye, while lips were made smaller in a rosebud shape. The overall effect \u2013 gloriously showcased by stars such as Josephine Baker, Greta Garbo, Myrna Loy and Marlene Dietrich \u2013 was extremely soft, romantic and feminine, despite the increasing emancipation of women and the trend for more androgynous haircuts and bone structures. It was a look that proved enormously influential in the 1970s, particularly to designers such as <a href=\"http://www.celiabirtwell.com/heritage/biography/\">Celia Birtwell</a> and Biba\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/b/biba,-barbara-hulanicki/\">Barbara Hulanicki</a>.</p> <h2>How they wore it in the 1940s</h2> <p>The makeup of the 40s is what most of us regard as a classic Old Hollywood look: matte, flawless complexion, sharply sculpted face contours, elegant black liner flicks, wide, pillarbox-red lips and soft-set hair. Its clean, bold, graphic simplicity worked beautifully on film, but also, for ordinary people: makeup was rationed throughout the decade, so the fewer products that were needed, the better (no makeup at all would be unthinkable: even the government urged women to \u201cput their best face forward\u201d in order to boost soldier morale and remain jolly themselves).</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The limited colour palette of red, gold, beige, black, white and rose makes everything look more tasteful</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Pencils were most easily acquired, so brows figured hugely. In the early 40s, they were soft, paler in tone and rounded to run parallel with arched socket line shadow. Later on, in part thanks to film noir, they arched sharply, in parallel with feline flicked liquid liner on the lids (painted that way to make actresses look sleepily seductive).</p> <p>Despite the fact that 40s makeup is so easy to date through films and stars such as Lana Turner, Ingrid Bergman, Olivia de Havilland and my idol, Elizabeth Taylor, it remains, I think, the least faddish and most timeless beauty look.</p> <p>Forties features look like themselves: a little exaggerated, but mostly enhanced in moderation. It\u2019s a womanly, rather than girlish, aesthetic. The limited colour palette of red, gold, beige, black, white and rose makes everything look more tasteful, more refined. I cannot think of a lovelier way to make up.</p> <h2>How they wore it in the 1950s</h2> <p>The 50s look is perhaps now the most recognisable period look, partly owing to the influence of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/mad-men-tv-series\">Mad Men</a> (all coral lips and teased chignons), but also to 50s pastiche pieces such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/grease\">Grease</a> (bouncy ponytails and extra-long falsies).</p> <p>The decade was certainly a pivotal one for the beauty and consumer industries generally. This was when salon culture really took off: women across all economic groups routinely visited a professional for a weekly set, and it wasn\u2019t at all unusual never to wash one\u2019s own hair (which was now generally worn shorter for ease of maintenance between appointments).</p> <p>The rise of the working woman meant that makeup looks varied and became more colourful according to outfit (pastel green, blue or lilac shadows were popular), and increased office work (as opposed to manual and factory jobs) made manicures a viable prospect for normal women. The elegance of the 40s didn\u2019t disappear, but certainly became glossier and sexier thanks to Marilyn Monroe, Dorothy Dandridge and Jayne Mansfield.</p> <p>Despite this, it was still frowned upon for a woman to buy her own perfume: she should wait to be gifted it by a man. American beauty entrepreneur Est\u00e9e Lauder got around the problem <a href=\"http://www.esteelauder.co.uk/product/13093/9493/Product-Catalog/Fragrance/For-Women/Youth-Dew/Youth-Dew/Eau-de-Parfum-Spray\">by disguising her new scent, Youth Dew</a>, as a bath oil and undercutting the elite French perfume houses by some distance. Fifties women bought with impunity, loved it and a beauty icon was born; you can still buy the original oil today.</p> <h2>How they wore it in the 1960s</h2> <p>Sixties makeup is so much a part of British pop culture that it\u2019s unfairly become a cliche: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2014/jan/07/celebrity-portraits-by-terry-oneill-in-pictures\">Terry O\u2019Neill\u2019s</a> iconic images of Twiggy, saucer eyes trimmed top and bottom with long, spindly falsies. But while it was certainly revolutionary and hugely influential, this mod-ish style was specifically known as the London Look and adopted almost exclusively by young people. In an era obsessed with experimentation and increased sexual freedom, makeup looks were inevitably a little broader and more diverse.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Of course, the 60s were a game of two halves, albeit unequal ones</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>For me, the most interesting developments were in France, specifically on Paris\u2019s Left Bank and as part of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_New_Wave\">Nouvelle Vague movement</a>. The aesthetic here combined the sophistication and womanliness of the classic 60s look with the bold chic of London. It flattened or ruffled the meticulous coiffs of the former, appropriated the monochromatic eyes of the latter, discarded all gimmicks, and made 60s beauty an altogether sexier and more grownup affair. Brigitte Bardot\u2019s bed head, thick black swooshes of liner and pale, almost invisible pout, and Anna Karina\u2019s thick fringe and polished complexion remain as sophisticated and relevant now as they did then.</p> <p>Of course, the 60s were a game of two halves, albeit unequal ones, and the late 60s aesthetic was altogether different. Most notable was the Laurel Canyon hippie look: practically no makeup other than brightly coloured facepaint and naive illustrations on festival-goers and hardcore flower children. 1970s disco could not come soon enough.</p> <p>\u2022 This is an edited extract from Pretty Iconic: A Personal Look At The Beauty Products That Changed The World, by Sali Hughes, published next week by Harper Collins at \u00a326.

  "<p>The future is a funny place to live. A few years ago, I bought a lamp controlled by Wi-Fi. \u201cNo more getting up and switching things on for me!\u201d I thought, smugly. It was only once I\u2019d bought the lamp that I realised how tedious it is to get your phone out, unlock it, swipe through to the right app, open it, select the correct lamp and switch it on every evening.</p> <p>So I struck upon a brilliant plan. I saw a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/kickstarter\">Kickstarter</a> for a physical button that links to your phone via Bluetooth and connects to Wi-Fi-enabled objects. I bought that, too, hooked it up to the lamp and stuck it on my wall.</p> <p>\u201cLook at this!\u201d I told my wife. \u201cNow I can turn it on without using my phone.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCongratulations,\u201d she said. \u201cYou just spent \u00a3200 on a light switch.\u201d</p> <p>Since then we\u2019ve seen great progress in the world of home robotics, but is any of it actually life-improving? I decided to find out.</p> <h2>Test 1 <a href=\"http://www.myrobotcenter.co.uk/en_gb/entertainment-robots/surveillance-robots/sense-mother\">Sen.se Mother</a> home and family monitoring system</h2> <p>I have never read the robot marketing rule book, but I suspect page one simply contains the words \u201cDo not call your robot Mother\u201d. Because that\u2019s creepy, isn\u2019t it? It\u2019s Norman Bates. It\u2019s stifling and overprotective. If there\u2019s a robot called Mother, then what does that make you? Is that what the robots want us to think: that we\u2019re all useless babies?</p> <p>Worse still, Mother is a vaguely <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matryoshka_doll\">matryoshka</a>-looking thing with a light-up face. You know it\u2019s working because it smiles at you. Two eyes and a mouth light up and leer at you in an unbroken rictus grin, day and night. During the testing phase, I found myself becoming more uneasy as evening approached, simply because I couldn\u2019t stand the thought of my living room being lit solely by the sinister glow of Mother\u2019s monstrous grimace.</p> <p>Why am I telling you what Mother looks like, rather than what it does? Simple. It\u2019s because I\u2019m still not entirely sure. It\u2019s the centrepiece of a range of keyring-sized sensors that you can use in any way you want. According to Mother\u2019s website, it will \u201chelp you feel better, gain peace of mind, know yourself and your environment and make life easier\u201d, but that all sounds like meaningless marketing hooey. Basically \u2013 and I\u2019m still only 75% sure I\u2019m getting this right \u2013 it monitors everything you do.</p> <p>Want to know how much you move about each day? Put a sensor in your pocket, and it\u2019ll track you. Want to know if your flatmate keeps going into your bedroom when you\u2019re out? Put a sensor on the door, and you\u2019ll get a text every time it opens. Want to see if anyone in your house is better at brushing their teeth than you, because you\u2019re some sort of psychopath? Put a sensor on everyone\u2019s toothbrush, and it\u2019ll measure the duration and regularity of everyone\u2019s toothbrushing activity, and then rank you. Want the Mother unit to make a weird noise whenever your kid plays with a specific toy, for no reason whatsoever? It does that, too, as well as solving all manner of other shriekingly mundane non-problems around the house.</p> <p>I did many of these things (except the toothbrushing thing, because I\u2019m an adult) but kept running into the same problem. Why? Why was I doing this? Why did I need to collect data about how much I move, or what happens when I\u2019m not here? I don\u2019t need a robot to tell me how well I\u2019ve been sleeping, because I\u2019m a normal person with a functioning perception of my own tiredness. And even its more useful functions, such as telling you when to take your medication, can be performed for free with the alarm settings on the phone you already own.</p> <p>Everything about Mother feels superfluous, apart from its nightmarish, unblinking, illuminated face, which is just upsetting.

Despite the talent involved \u2013 Scott behind the camera, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/michael-fassbender\">Michael Fassbender</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/javierbardem\">Javier Bardem</a> out in front, script by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/cormac-mccarthy\">Cormac McCarthy</a> \u2013 the film was a commercial and critical failure. One scene, however, has lived on; the one in which Bardem recounts an occasion when a knickerless Cameron Diaz performed an obscene act on his Ferrari\u2019s windscreen. Why am I telling you this? It\u2019s because I had the misfortune of operating the Ecovacs Winbot from inside my house while it cleaned my front window. But we\u2019ll come to that momentarily.</p> <p>I hate the Winbot. In theory, it\u2019s great. It\u2019s a large, heavy, suction-powered robot that\u2019s supposed to crawl all over your windows until they sparkle. In practice, it is a monumental pain in the arse. For starters, it requires a constant connection to a power source, which not only means you\u2019ll have cables trailing through your house, but also that you can\u2019t clean anything too far away from a plug socket.</p> <p>Then there\u2019s the set-up, which requires the application of a cleaning cloth and a specific fluid right before you switch it on, preventing you from operating it from afar. If you have a regular-sized bay window, the whole thing becomes impossible to use: its turning circle is so great, it leaves a grubby line of dirt around the edges. Even if you take charge, overriding the automatic setting by using the remote control, it squeals and whines so alarmingly that you\u2019ll end up yanking it off the window and taking it indoors before the neighbours think you\u2019ve got a secret sex dungeon.</p> <p>Which brings me to how it looks from the other side of the glass. It\u2019s like a specific type of borderline-illegal Japanese pornography or, possibly, feeding time at the aquarium. You do not want to have the Winbot switched on if the vicar is coming over for tea. Bardem said of Diaz\u2019s car abuse in The Counsellor that, \u201cWhen you see something like that, it changes you.\u201d I know how he feels.</p> <p>Perhaps (and this is a big perhaps) if we lived in a place that had bigger windows, the Winbot would make a little more sense. There are <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8Us-KRVatU\">YouTube videos of it doing great work on patio doors</a>, for example.</p> <p>We do have spotless windows now. But this is because, in a fit of anger, I tore off Winbot\u2019s cleaning cloth and wiped them with it, using my own hands, like a caveman.</p> <p><em>\u00a3249.

In the end, we only had one, because I forgot that barbecues are expensive and disappointing and, if you\u2019re the schmuck who ends up doing all the cooking, extremely boring.</p> <p>My barbecue grill was dirty back then, so it pretty much borders on toxic waste a year later. It\u2019s blackened and lumpy and, I thought, doomed for the scrapheap. But the Grillbot promised to change that.</p> <p>Let me explain the Grillbot to you. It\u2019s a tiny circular robot, covered in rotating wire brushes. You pop it down on your barbecue, close the lid and let it do its business. However, where the Winbot is slow and methodical, this is absolutely frenzied. It\u2019s a terrier of a thing, a trapped chinchilla. It\u2019s a wasp in a jar, pinging about as fast as it can like a firework in a metal dustbin, bashing the dirt off the grill with sheer blunt force trauma. And, oh God, it\u2019s noisy.</p> <p>All this makes the Grillbot especially easy to like. It\u2019s so erratic, you can easily project a personality on to it: it\u2019s a scrappy kid, an overexcited toddler. I would love the Grillbot, were it not for the fact that it didn\u2019t actually clean my grill very well.</p> <p>It has three settings \u2013 10 minutes, 20 minutes and 30 minutes \u2013 and even after half an hour of cleaning, it had only really scrubbed away at the top half of the grill. This is by design, since the Grillbot lacks the capability to clean the underside, but it\u2019s still less than ideal. The only way to solve it is to flip the grill and set it to work all over again. But that would mean subjecting everyone in the neighbourhood to a full hour of its berserk clanging, and even I\u2019m not inconsiderate enough for that.</p> <p>So I opted for plan B: taking the barbecue to the skip and cooking everything in an oven like an adult instead. Humanity 1, Skynet 0.</p> <p><em>\u00a399.

Partly because it was a radiator, and nobody in the history of the English language has managed to write entertainingly about radiators, but mainly because it arrived during the hottest summer in a decade, which isn\u2019t the greatest time to test a product that makes your house warmer. Still, here goes nothing.<br></p> <p>The SmartWave feels like a next-generation piece of kit. It\u2019s an electric radiator with an infrared sensor. Over a week, it monitors and registers all movement around it, slowly piecing together a picture of how and when each room is used. It then uses this information to switch itself on and off automatically.</p> <p>For instance, I start work at 6am. Over the course of its first week, the SmartWave grew to learn this, and started to heat my office at 5.30, to make it nice and toasty when I stumbled in each morning. In order to know it was working, I had to set it to a temperature warmer than the already quite warm ambient temperature of the room, which meant I had to spend the bulk of August eating Calippos naked in front of a fan; but that\u2019s hardly the SmartWave\u2019s fault.</p> <p>If you happen to break your routine by starting early or finishing late, the SmartWave\u2019s sensor will kick in to ensure the room is heated only when there\u2019s someone in it. And that\u2019s wonderful, because it\u2019s important to know you can transform any room in your house into an Amazonian sweat lodge in the height of summer simply by walking into it.</p> <p>In fact, I\u2019m so impressed with the SmartWave that I\u2019ve decided to get one of my own for the winter, when using it won\u2019t feel like some sort of terrible punishment for a crime I\u2019m not sure I committed.</p> <p><em>From \u00a3279.99.

It was one of the biggest disappointments of my life. The Roomba promised so much \u2013 I never had to vacuum again! \u2013 but delivered so little. Every day I\u2019d come home to find a giant plastic pizza choking on a shoelace, or stuck under a sofa, or banging into a wall again and again, with no discernible improvement in the state of my carpet.</p> <p>Rather than let this robotic idiot blunder around my living room for an hour a day, I decided to use a regular manual vacuum cleaner for 90 seconds once a week instead.</p> <p>The Dyson, though, is a vast improvement. It has a smaller footprint than my Roomba, so takes up less space. It runs on tank-style caterpillar tracks, so it\u2019s more manoeuvrable. It\u2019s more powerful, so it actually picks stuff up. And, best of all, I can control it from my phone. This means that if I\u2019m out, and my mum says she\u2019s coming over, I can press a button to send the Dyson into action and get a notification when its cleaning cycle has completed; I can rest safe in the knowledge that my mother won\u2019t know what a hideous slob I am.</p> <p>The texts from the vacuum are great in theory, but there are drawbacks. The first time I used it \u2013 after a torturous set-up that drove me to the brink of sanity \u2013 I soon received an error message. \u201cThere has been a problem,\u201d my phone said, which sent my mind into overdrive. Had it tipped over? Had it got snagged on a wire and pulled my television to the ground? Was something on fire? The lack of information was terrifying, like getting a text from a child reading: \u201cI\u2019ve been abducted, but try not to worry.\u201d I wanted to rush home and rescue it, the poor sweetheart.</p> <p>The error messages continue from time to time, but I have since used the Dyson enough not to worry. Error or no error, I know that things will be OK and my floor will be clean when I get home. My Dyson is quick and reliable, and smart enough to exorcise any lingering memories from the bad old Roomba days.</p> <p>In fact, it\u2019s starting to feel like part of the family; specifically the part of the family that we force into unpaid manual labour because we\u2019re too lazy to do it ourselves. It\u2019s Cinderella, basically, and I\u2019m an ugly sister. I will give this one up very, very reluctantly.</p> <p><em>\u00a3799.99.

This is because the Echo is very, very easy to use. It is basically a Wi-Fi speaker with a Siri-style assistant, but it feels like the butler you never knew you wanted. The Echo\u2019s personality is supplied by Alexa, another female robot, because apparently all robotics engineers have deep-set mummy issues. And you can ask her anything. Anything at all.</p> <p>At first, I guarantee that this will paralyse you. You\u2019ll find yourself looking up questions on the Amazon website. The first suggested question is: \u201cAlexa, why is the sky blue?\u201d So you ask that, and she tells you that the molecules of the atmosphere scatter blue light more than other colours.</p> <p>You then say, \u201cAlexa, play some Daft Punk.\u201d Miraculously, Alexa replies with, \u201cHere are the most popular Daft Punk songs from Amazon Music\u201d, and plays <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TOXw9zQCAc\">Fresh</a> from the Homework album.

She set alarms for me, reminded me to call my parents. The voice recognition is light years ahead of anything I\u2019ve used before. Soon I was calling out Alexa\u2019s name so casually that a visiting friend thought I was hiding a mistress in the living room.</p> <p>She slotted in so intuitively that I found myself wishing she could do more. I started asking the impossible: \u201cAlexa, turn on the TV\u201d, to no response. \u201cAlexa, where are my keys?\u201d The Echo now mainly functions as a world-beating music-delivery service, but in time requests such as this won\u2019t be beyond her.</p> <p>At one point, I got cocky and asked Alexa to pre-order the book I\u2019m writing, even though you can\u2019t yet make purchases on the Echo. Something got mixed up, and Alexa started playing a podcast I had recorded last year instead. Hand on heart, I spent 20 seconds convinced that Alexa had retrieved the manuscript from my laptop, finished it for me, and used my previous voice commands to piece together an audiobook. Now that would be a robot worth paying for.</p> <p>As it stands, the Echo is great. So great that I\u2019ve called my son Alexa twice, am going to do everything in my power to steal my test unit, and don\u2019t mind handing over huge wads of personal information to a faceless corporation.

Rintoul said those family members were also set to be paid \u201cthousands\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a massive amount of money to coerce people to go from Nauru to Cambodia, but people don\u2019t see it as a reliable solution,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ve also now been offered loans if they do resettle. But the reality is they have three out of nearly 1,000 people, and for the vast majority, there is no real interest.\u201d</p> <p> The deal was signed in September 2014 by then immigration minister Scott Morrison and Cambodian interior minister Sar Kheng, who refused to acknowledge questions about the $40m cost of the resettlement deal. </p> <p>An additional $15.5m was tacked on to facilitate the movement of the original four \u2013 three Iranians and a Rohingya man \u2013 who made the journey to Phnom Penh in June 2015. They were later joined by another Rohingya refugee. Sequestered in a secluded villa, a team from the International Organization for Migration (IOM) was assigned to help the new arrivals learn Khmer, familiarise themselves with their new surroundings and look for work. But the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/may/28/last-refugee-among-group-australia-sent-to-cambodia-returns-to-home-country\">original four all ultimately returned</a> to the countries from where they had once fled, and the lone Rohingya who remains has since spoken of his misery here.</p> <p>The so-called Cambodia Solution has been criticised by Labor, human rights groups, and international law experts as a costly failure.</p> <p>In August, the Phnom Penh Post reported that Connect Settlement Services was also brought on board to facilitate the resettlement of refugees from Nauru to Cambodia.

  "<p>I think <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/jeremy-paxman\">Jeremy Paxman</a> wants to be known, but only on his own terms, and these terms are tidal and possibly a mystery to himself. He worries, for instance, that his obituary will be headlined Man Who Asked Same Question Of Michael Howard 14 Times Dies. Except it wasn\u2019t 14 times, he notes beadily in his new memoir, <a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/untitled-446407.html\">A Life In Questions</a>, already anticipating the posthumous lies that might be told: \u201cThe repetition of that number proves that what matters is who produced the first account.\u201d (For the record, it was 12 times.)</p> <p>Paxman worries about his public image but then starts fights: with Marks &amp; Spencer, for instance, over <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/jan/21/fashion.lifeandhealth\">the support offered by their pants</a>. (The clue to his willingness to do this, I think, is also in his memoir, where he notes that Ruby Wax told Options magazine in 1994 that he has \u201chuge genitals\u201d. I do not know how she came upon this information, and I do not ask.) Paxman still keeps a copy of an old interview with Best magazine in which he said he found clothes \u201creally boring\u201d. By way of revenge, Warehouse founder <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2013/oct/16/fashion-jeff-banks-award-retail\">Jeff Banks</a> then nominated him one of the worst-dressed men in Britain. \u201cThat man should loosen up,\u201d Banks said, \u201cand get into some soft linen.\u201d</p> <p>Perhaps that was true once. When we meet, in the Langham hotel opposite Broadcasting House in London, where Paxman has worked, on and off, for more than 40 years, he doesn\u2019t seem to want to talk about his memoir. It is a riveting book when he writes about himself, but halfway through he seems to lose interest, or courage, and speaks about what he did, not how he felt, which is less interesting. I do not really care that late-night news producers live in a state of nervous collapse; I expect it. He loses his tone, but it comes back at the end when he returns to his father, Keith, a man \u201cincapable of expressing affection\u201d, whose ghost runs backwards through the book.</p> <p>I sometimes see Paxman working in the London Library; he is usually intense, and friendly, probably because I once implied he was a feminist in print, and said his face was ravaged by ennui. Today he is apprehensive, and early; a schoolboy at the dentist, wearing clothes that Jeff Banks would not hate. He looks around the bar with fascinated eyes. \u201cHow,\u201d he asks, \u201cwould places like this function if it were not for people who came here to better themselves and understand service?\u201d He ponders the foreign staff\u2019s potential visa arrangements, and begins to ruminate on Brexit. He voted to remain: \u201cI just wish someone had had the guts to make a decent case.\u201d What would he have asked David Cameron the night after the referendum vote, had he still been at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/newsnight\">Newsnight</a>? \u201cAren\u2019t you a man who sacrificed his country for his party?\u201d he says, swiftly. He imagines Cameron\u2019s potential answers, and I remember how much I miss him on Newsnight.</p> <p>Paxman is fierce, even more so because he is not the raging caricature of myth, although he will put it on when it amuses him. He is kindly and interested, if occasionally derisive. If I were Paxman, and I have thought about this a lot since we met, I would have asked him: \u201cDid your emotionally distant father lead you to a career where you excelled, specifically, in seeking out and humiliating figures of authority?\u201d But I am not Paxman, so I tug at the edges, often pointlessly.</p> <p>He joined the BBC in 1972, going from Radio Brighton to Tonight, to Panorama, to the Six O\u2019Clock News to Breakfast Time to Newsnight; he was, for seven years, a war reporter and, along the way, he married and had three children. (He says nothing about his family in the book; his marriage is alluded to only in a picture caption. \u201cWhat they choose to disclose of their lives is up to them,\u201d he says.) His mother once told him she remembered him watching television with her, \u201cand seeing <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/special_report/1998/11/98/crossing_continents/125942.stm\">Julian Pettifer</a> \u2013 a very glamorous young reporter in Vietnam \u2013 jumping out of a helicopter and saying, \u2018I want his job.\u2019 I realise now, looking back, that journalism was a square peg in a square hole for me, but I don\u2019t have any recollection of this.\u201d</p> <p>Being an outsider can make you a good journalist though, I suggest. He answers with a rebuke: \u201cI once sat behind you at Labour party conference and heard you shamefully applauding some platform speaker and I thought, \u2018This isn\u2019t what we do.\u2019 You probably <em>stood up</em> and applauded, I don\u2019t know. Resolutely remain seated and do not applaud.\u201d I\u2019ve moved on, I say weakly; I wouldn\u2019t do that now.

His answer is: the ones whose cause is lost. \u201cI think that many of the people I most admire have not got right to the very top,\u201d he says. \u201cGetting to the top\u201d \u2013 there is a long silence \u2013 \u201crequires a compact with the devil.\u201d He pulls back slightly: \u201cThey are not all charlatans or shits, but we should just\u2026 [It\u2019s] like supping with the devil, you know.\u201d</p> <p>Has he ever hated a politician? \u201cNo.\u201d He sounds very cool and very far away. \u201cI\u2019ve never felt hatred. I\u2019m quite surprised you asked me. What right does anyone have to feel hatred? Of course not. I\u2019ve never hated anybody.\u201d He repeats this: \u201cI\u2019ve never hated anyone. I probably have said, \u2018I hate you\u2019, when younger. It\u2019s an utterly unproductive emotion. What\u2019s the point? Who cares what some pipsqueak journalist thinks?\u201d Except that the epigraph to his memoir is by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2004/oct/30/featuresreviews.guardianreview18\">Hilaire Belloc</a>:</p> <p>\u201cHere richly, with ridiculous display,</p> <p>The politician\u2019s corpse was laid away,</p> <p>While all of his acquaintance sneered and slanged</p> <p>I wept. For I had longed to see him hanged.\u201d</p> <p>Paxman is more comfortable talking about politics than about himself. (He has begun to respond to questions on any other subject with: \u201cYou\u2019ll have to do better than that!\u201d) \u201cThe comment that \u2018they [politicians] are all the same\u2019 reflects this widespread malaise that there is something not working about politics,\u201d he says. He distrusts \u201cthis requirement to reduce everything to simple binary choices. It is insulting to the intelligence. We know deep down that it\u2019s incredibly complicated.\u201d The problem of funding the NHS, for instance: \u201cNo one will engage with this. I think people are sick of the idiom, sick of the promise of jam tomorrow. It\u2019s imaginary jam, imaginary bread.\u201d In a healthier democracy, he thinks, \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t be standing on our back legs [in parliament] saying that everything our interlocutor is saying is rubbish. It\u2019s not true.\u201d</p> <p>Instead, he wants \u201ca parliament made up of spiky individuals. I want to be surprised. I want to feel there are people there who are making up their minds based on the issues. It\u2019s become almost totalitarian.\u201d Journalism, he believes, is withering, too. \u201cThe trade connives at its own irrelevance. This lifestyle stuff, the preponderance of comment over disclosure. If we aren\u2019t telling people things that make them go, \u2018Crikey\u2019, what\u2019s the point?\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I always felt inadequate. Well into my 40s, I would go to a party and lurk in the corner</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Paxman will admit to mistakes. He is ashamed, for instance, that he opened <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIPtmby9iI0\">his 2010 general election interview with Gordon Brown</a> with the words: \u201cPeople don\u2019t seem to like you.\u201d Like a boy who has done his time, he says, \u201cI\u2019ve \u2019fessed up to that in the book, haven\u2019t I? It was unkind. It was a bit unkind.\u201d</p> <p>Because, I add, some people did like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/gordon-brown\">Brown</a>: his wife, for instance. \u201c<em>You</em> apparently did!\u201d he shouts. But this is his slightly garbled defence: \u201cWhat you are trying to establish in an interview, it\u2019s always about something. People make up their mind about politicians on the basis of what they feel personally about things. I think it was a mean, mean question, but how he dealt with it told us something.\u201d Brown dealt with it by saying, \u201cYou\u2019re such a nice guy, Jeremy.\u201d</p> <p>Paxman was always harder on politicians than on anyone else. They were immune from his sensitivity and he accepts that he may have added to the public distrust of politicians, \u201cthough it does not keep me awake at night\u201d. He asked <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/davidcameron\">David Cameron</a> what a pink pussy was, as if he didn\u2019t know. He asked Silvio Berlusconi, off camera, if it was true he had called Angela Merkel <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/may/21/jeremy-paxman-stuns-silvio-berlusconi-angela-merkel-insult-allegation\">\u201can unfuckable lard arse\u201d</a>. What Berlusconi replied, he doesn\u2019t say.</p> <p>In his memoir, Paxman writes that he once asked <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/theresamay\">Theresa May</a>, also off camera, \u201cAre those fuck-me shoes?\u201d \u201cI bet you Theresa May has no recollection,\u201d he says now. I bet she has. \u201cDo you know about shoes?\u201d he asks me. He seems genuinely curious. \u201cI now understand they are kitten heels, aren\u2019t they?\u201d He has an appetite for trivia, but then he is interested in everything. When he insisted Marks &amp; Spencer underpants had declined in quality, the then chairman Stuart Rose invited him to lunch, bringing in male models in different underpants and inviting Paxman to feel the quality. This was a private lunch. Rose\u2019s on-the-record assessment was that, \u201cas men get older, their balls hang lower\u201d.</p> <p>***</p> <p>Jeremy Paxman grew up poised between classes, which makes for a good journalist, but not, I suspect, a happy child. His father was a naval officer and, later, a salesman of limited success who ended up living on the other side of the world. Keith was so emotionally distant that, on one return from sea, the infant Paxman didn\u2019t recognise his father and ran away screaming. (His sister, he writes, once found their father crying on the bathroom floor. He asked her to leave, and they never spoke about it.) Keith could not bear to be disobeyed. \u201cI was thrashed by sticks, shoes, cricket stumps, cricket bats or the flat of his hand,\u201d Paxman writes. \u201cIn the most intense row \u2013 or at least the one I recall most intensely \u2013 he sent me to my room for disobeying him, and when I stood my ground, he tried to drag me upstairs. Within a minute or so, all that was left of the shirt was the collar.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"74e6116346c81d92692cc6dfef5eae62f4383dab\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/74e6116346c81d92692cc6dfef5eae62f4383dab/0_172_2048_1229/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jeremy Paxman, on the right, with his younger brothers and his father, Keith, a man \u2018incapable of expressing affection\u2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Paxman, on the right, with his younger brothers and his father, Keith, a man \u2018incapable of expressing affection\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: courtesy of Jeremy Paxman</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>His mother Joan\u2019s family eventually made money, from a canning factory; this paid for private schools for the four Paxman children. They grew up in crumbling houses in Worcestershire and Yorkshire; they were middle class, but \u201changing in there by our fingernails\u201d. They lived \u201cin full mimicry of what were presumed to be our betters\u201d.</p> <p>There is a lot about Keith in Paxman\u2019s book, but almost nothing about Joan. \u201cI loved my mother, but everyone does, don\u2019t they?\u201d he says. It is a genuine question. He relates how his parents met, and talks about Joan\u2019s hair and how it changed throughout her life. The images move through his head. \u201cI remember this rather elegant woman with jet-black hair, she wore it in a bun, then cut it short when it went grey.\u201d She was \u201cvery conventional. Her characteristic refrain was, \u2018We can\u2019t afford it.\u2019\u201d The three boys \u2013 he is the oldest \u2013 were \u201calways fighting. Joan was run ragged. A busy, active person constantly running around stamping out this fire.\u201d He searches for a photograph of her on his telephone, and shows it to me. She is handsome, and indistinct in a group of female relatives, but she looks strong. \u201cVery Yorkshire,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Unexpectedly, he opens up: \u201cI think, growing up, I never felt that I belonged anywhere and I haven\u2019t really felt that until probably about the last 10 years, or 15 years, or something like that. People develop very simple-minded ideas about all this, and only you know what you\u2019re really feeling inside \u2013 and I always felt inadequate. I always felt, \u2018Am I going to cut the mustard here?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Eventually, he learned \u201cthe tricks of going into a room and not being frightened. But well into my 40s, I would expect to go to a party and lurk in the corner, cornered by the most boring person in the room.\u201d</p> <p>What changed? \u201cI\u2019m 66 years old,\u201d he says, and the pensive mood flies away. \u201cWhat\u2019s that thing George Melly said? The best thing about growing old is losing your libido, like being unshackled from a lunatic!\u201d Does that resonate with you, I say, being unshackled from a lunatic libido?</p> <p>\u201cNot really, no,\u201d he says in his poshest voice. Paxman has an arsenal of voices, a rainbow of derision and engagement. This one makes you \u2013 or \u201cone\u201d, he might say \u2013 feel like a twit. \u201cI\u2019m not going to discuss it.\u201d He then ruins this statement by giggling. You brought it up, I say. \u201cMore fool me,\u201d he says.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the point of worrying about these things?\u201d he asks. He is talking about inadequacy again. \u201cThere is nothing to be gained by worrying. The implied expectation of sympathy, and I don\u2019t think any of us deserve sympathy.\u201d I think of his father on the bathroom floor, unable to ask for sympathy, even from his child. \u201cI feel very lucky that I\u2019ve had a job which enabled me to go to amazing places, meet interesting people and I don\u2019t think I deserve any sympathy, really.\u201d This is the Miss World Defence; in his memoir, he writes that he had therapy, and took anti-depressants, for several years.</p> <p>Does he ruminate on why he was depressed? \u201cDid I ruminate on <em>what</em>?\u201d he asks. It is an enormous \u201cwhat\u201d. On the reason for his depression, I remind him.</p> <p>\u201cI never ruminated,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a fact of life. It\u2019s only in the last decade or so that I really thought seriously about why one has the feelings one has. I tried to think about it. What the reason is for responding to things in a particular way.\u201d He is speaking very slowly. He is starting to open up \u2013 and then he isn\u2019t.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4300bf20b5a7d3e649334c4526b9014101708d32\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4300bf20b5a7d3e649334c4526b9014101708d32/0_41_1483_890/1000.jpg\" alt=\"In El Salvador in 1982, with cameraman Alan \u2018Bulletproof\u2019 Stevens.

He bangs again. \u201cThis room\u2019s going to fall down!\u201d he shouts. \u201cSomeone do something about it, quick!\u201d I suspect he will continue to bang until I change the subject. The waitress comes over to suggest we have tea.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s great, let\u2019s have the tea, if we may, please!\u201d He is still shouting, but he is polite. He is very kind when he wants to be; in his memoir, he recalls that the matron of his school, Malvern College, was unhappily in love with a tutor, and she wept over the teenage Paxman. He was bewildered, but let her. He also chose, at school, to help local children with special needs learn to tie their shoelaces, rather than play soldiers. I think the matron was his first real interview, though unasked. He asks the waitress for Earl Grey.</p> <p>I say weakly, \u201cLet\u2019s move on.\u201d I am a coward, and although he is probably relieved I have stopped asking about his depression, I suspect he despises me for it, too. Instead, I ask about his feelings of not being accepted, specifically at Cambridge University, where he studied English and edited Varsity magazine, and where, he says, he used to pose by a bridge, as if tempted to jump off. He gives a deep sigh. It sounds like, \u201cNeeer.\u201d He couldn\u2019t see the life before him then; now that he can, the past feels different. \u201cI loved it!\u201d he explodes. \u201cI absolutely loved it! Three years to sit around reading wonderful books, occasionally holding forth and spending a lot of time with people of your own age, most of them much cleverer, and having to think about things\u2026 it was fantastic!</p> <p>\u201cI was unhappy,\u201d he adds, \u201cas I have been unhappy much of my life. I\u2019m not saying I\u2019m looking for sympathy, but I recognise that actually it was a wonderful, wonderful time. The happiest days of my life, I suppose.\u201d</p> <p>I mention the bridge. \u201cWhy are you furrowing your brows like that?\u201d he asks. He laughs again. I wanted to ask, I say, when the depression first manifested. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve nothing else to say about it.\u201d</p> <p>In the introduction to his book, Paxman mentions that he shoots squirrels from his toilet through the bathroom window. I ask him about this; but my question is apparently misleading. \u201cThere is a key clause missing,\u201d he says. \u201cThe seat \u2013 the lid, or whatever \u2013 is down. The seat is down when this occurred.\u201d</p> <p>What else annoys him, aside from squirrels? He pauses, searches for an answer, gives up and shouts: \u201cVirtually everything!\u201d He has an anecdote to illustrate it: \u201cI was just in John Lewis, trying to buy a toaster, and I said to the woman, \u2018What\u2019s the best kind of toaster? These ones are quite good, aren\u2019t they \u2013 they are made in Britain?\u2019 And it was extortionate, \u00a3160 or something. I said, \u2018No one is going to pay \u00a3160 for a toaster unless they are off their head!\u2019\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"942ad512154e6a54bf6cd34ef92e334ed10937a2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/942ad512154e6a54bf6cd34ef92e334ed10937a2/0_1_4288_2573/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jeremy Paxman on the set of Newsnight in 2006.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">On the set of Newsnight in 2006.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jeff Overs/BBC News &amp; Current Affairs via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I listen to him rant and, as I do, wrap my nicotine gum in paper and put it in my bag; I do not want to leave it on the table. \u201cThat\u2019s disgusting,\u201d he says. \u201cNow you will have to open your handbag [to clean it]. I bet it\u2019s full of old bits of chewing gum.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cVirtually everything\u201d annoys him, he repeats, \u201cbut some things make me feel very happy. On the tube as I was coming here, there was a man and a woman and a baby in a pushchair, and they were making faces at the baby and the baby was laughing.\u201d He sounds terribly sincere. \u201cI thought, \u2018That\u2019s wonderful.\u2019 I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m rabbiting on. God save us from people who go through life indifferent to things. We want to feel. Being irritated by things, or being made happy by things, is a sign that you are noticing. Do you want to go through life not noticing things?\u201d</p> <p>I love this image of Paxman; now that he is no longer tormenting senior politicians, he is watching babies laugh on public transport, and he is moved by it. Perhaps this is the truest Paxman.</p> <p>I\u2019m not sure why he left Newsnight in 2014, after 25 years, or what he thinks of it now; he isn\u2019t telling. He spends an age deciding what to tell me and eventually says, \u201cI don\u2019t see it. I like to go to bed early. Which, incidentally, means I can say I don\u2019t know what I think, because I don\u2019t see it.\u201d</p> <p>My own theory is that he got too happy for it, as standup comics do; once you have mellowed, you cannot summon the rage. (In the book, he writes: \u201cI don\u2019t like the fact that I have mellowed, but I cannot deny it\u201d.) Later, he says, \u201cIt\u2019s much more important to have friends than enemies.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>God save us from people who go through life being indifferent to things. Being irritated is a sign you are noticing</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Or perhaps it was the weather that finished him? At the end of his tenure on Newsnight, Paxman was required to comment on the weather and he did so, at peak sarcasm. He gasps silently when I mention this, and lets out a great, \u201cThat was <em>absurd!</em>\u201d Weather reportage, he says, has turned into, \u201ca form of nannying, you know, I can\u2019t stand it\u201d. He turns to me and says softly: \u201cIt\u2019s going to be cold tomorrow, so do make sure you wrap up warm.\u201d The voice is perfect; I believe he cares that the theoretical viewer is wearing a sweater. Or (it is hot the day we meet), \u201cDo be sure to take your bottle of water with you.\u201d So why did he do it? He gives two answers: \u201cI thought it was funny,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd why would anyone refuse? Presenters should do what they are bloody well told.\u201d But remembering again the indignity, he booms: \u201cOh for heaven\u2019s sake!\u201d</p> <p>He adds that he shouldn\u2019t have let this attitude show. \u201cIf you are right \u2013 and it\u2019s for others to judge \u2013 that you become immensely sarcastic and don\u2019t take things seriously, you are letting your colleagues down.\u201d He is veering still, as I suspect he always has, between classes, because that is what was expected of him when he was young: between the establishment and the revolutionaries. If he never chose a side, this is what makes him hard to read, and easy to watch.</p> <p>We are almost finished, so I ask when he felt closest to belonging. He complains, somewhat tangentially, about the deification of the media: \u201cIt didn\u2019t exist 60 or 70 years ago. But I suppose I belong there. I\u2019m not sure I want to belong, actually. But I suppose I\u2019ve got used to it and I quite enjoy it now. I don\u2019t want to belong.\u201d Now he sounds youthful in his contradictions.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2016/oct/11/im-with-you-on-the-digital-revolution-its-the-lack-of-journalism-i-cant-face\">I'm with you on the digital revolution, it's the lack of journalism I can't face</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I am allowed only one more question, so I ask about his seven years as a war reporter; he writes in the memoir, that, eventually, \u201cI couldn\u2019t sleep properly, and when eventually I did manage to drop off, I awoke not even knowing what country I was in. In my dreams men with guns in Africa, Ireland, Latin America and the Middle East got all muddled in my head.

I made no bones about it. I got too frightened. You\u2019ve got to be able to control your imagination, and I couldn\u2019t. I didn\u2019t feel a sense of loss when I quit, but I did feel a slight sense of inadequacy. But then I\u2019ve always felt that. It was just another thing one couldn\u2019t do particularly well.\u201d</p> <p>He gives a huge laugh.

  "<p>Having been a <em>Spitting Image</em> puppet, voiced a biographical caricature on <em>Family Guy</em> and characterised himself in a film and several plays, Alan Bennett has an unusual level of recognition for a writer. A consequence of this is requests for selfies, even, as Bennett notes, \u201cwhen you\u2019re plainly running for a train\u201d.</p> <p>Shyness may be a fault, but politeness a virtue, so he always accepts, except for a brief recent spell of novel political protest. \u201cI went through a rather prissy period immediately after Brexit. I\u2019d ask people if they voted in or out. And, if they\u2019d voted out, I wouldn\u2019t give them a selfie. But it started to seem rather mean, so I&nbsp;stopped doing it.\u201d</p> <p>Bennett has still not adjusted to the prospect of the UK leaving the EU, however: \u201cFor me \u2013 I think it was probably the same for a lot of people \u2013 there was a few weeks of gloom, really. I couldn\u2019t throw it off. It was like a general election result, but worse. I still find it very difficult to understand. Just on a personal level, my stuff does very well in Italy and Germany, and to a lesser extent in France, and I feel very embarrassed \u2026 Because you just feel it\u2019s a slap in the face for them. I also feel we had a duty to stay to counter, for example, Hungary, which is very fascist at the moment.\u201d</p> <p>The visual familiarity that leads to Bennett being asked to pose for mobiles more than say David Hare or Caryl Churchill comes partly from his tendency to wear almost a uniform of button-down shirt and tie under a sweater. On an early autumn morning in the basement kitchen of his house in north London, he is the very model of this look, which has recently been further popularised by Alex Jennings playing two versions of the writer (the public and the private man)<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/nov/15/lady-in-van-review-maggie-smith-alan-bennett\" title=\"\"> in <em>The Lady in the Van</em></a>, a film version of Bennett\u2019s play and memoir about a malodorous evangelist who lived on his drive for many years.

Does he still get acting offers?</p> <p>\u201cVery few,\u201d he says, in that voice that manages to be jauntily mournful. \u201cI get offered those career-reviving options, like the one where you\u2019re in a jungle.\u201d As he would seem most temperamentally suited to a TV series called <em>Get Me Out of Here, I\u2019m Not a Celebrity!</em>, I have to check that he really was tapped up for the Ant &amp; Dec ITV franchise: \u201cYou were invited to appear on <em>I\u2019m a Celebrity, Get Me Out&nbsp;of&nbsp;Here</em>?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. When they first asked, I tried to find out who were the other people, but they wouldn\u2019t tell me. It\u2019s rather chastening when you realise you\u2019ve been singled out because they think: \u2018Oh, he could do with a bit of a shot in the arm.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Although not encyclopedic on the history of reality TV, Bennett thinks that the run he ducked was won by a boy-band member. Has he never been offered <em>Strictly Come Dancing</em>? \u201cOh, no. It\u2019s one of Rupert\u2019s jokes that I must never be allowed to do any type of dancing because it\u2019s so&nbsp;embarrassing.\u201d</p> <p>Rupert is Bennett\u2019s civil partner (they saw no need to take the Cameron upgrade of gay marriage), Rupert Thomas, editor of World of Interiors magazine. Across the three volumes of diaries and occasional writings that Bennett has published \u2013 <em>Writing Home</em> (1994), <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/oct/15/featuresreviews.guardianreview4\" title=\"\"><em>Untold Stories</em></a> (2005), and now <em>Keeping On Keeping On</em> \u2013 the development of the writer\u2019s private life has been a key theme.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/oct/13/lady-in-the-van-shoots-camden-town-alan-bennett-maggie-smith\">Alan Bennett: 'It was weird to film The Lady in the Van in my old house'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The first anthology, mentioning Bennett\u2019s relationship with Anne Davies, a neighbour in the Yorkshire village where he has a cottage, resulted in his becoming a rare example of a celebrity outed by the tabloids for having secretly been a heterosexual. In the second book, he came out as living with Rupert and having been treated for colon cancer. Bennett retrospectively attributed the new level of self-exposure in <em>Untold Stories</em> to the belief that he would be dead by the time the volume was out in paperback (his oncologist later admitted that the survival odds had been lower than 50-50).</p> <p>Although Bennett lugubriously jokes about the appearance of a sequel 11 years on, at the age of 82, that \u201cI will be dead after this one comes out. I can\u2019t have much longer\u201d, the new book is, in every sense, a more benign work, focusing on domestic and romantic life with Rupert, and restricting a seven-hour operation for a stomach aneurysm in 2008 to a single entry. This medical reticence, he says, was not due to privacy but theatrical judgment: \u201cIt wasn\u2019t that it dramatically burst. They just found two, one of them was in a peculiar place, so they couldn\u2019t just do a stent, they had to transplant a vein and it took seven hours. I knew nothing about it but I think Rupert had just about written me off, I was in there so long.\u201d</p> <p>Bennett writes his diaries in longhand, giving them for transcription to a secretary, Sue Powell, who has been typing up his life for more than 20 years. This text \u2013 from which the London Review of Books takes a \u201cdiary of the year\u201d, published each December \u2013 goes to the Faber archive, while the manuscript diaries are sent to the Bodleian library in Oxford, Bennett\u2019s alma mater, to which he has donated his papers.</p> <p>\u201cI think there are people who thought that the only way I was going to get into the Bodleian was by giving them the stuff,\u201d says Bennett. \u201cBut I don\u2019t care.\u201d</p> <p>Bennett sometimes has to decipher his handwriting for Powell, but, while the political diarist Alan Clark used to employ a particularly \u201ccrabbed hand\u201d when recording sexual details, Bennett uses no such subterfuge. \u201cNo, no. There aren\u2019t many dirty bits, but I always think Sue knows more about me than anyone because she gets the unexpurgated version. So she sees all the dirty bits, such as they are. I always think when she comes round to collect it, and takes it away in her handbag, that if she\u2019s mugged and they go to the Daily Mail, that\u2019ll be the end of me.\u201d</p> <p>Unsparing as a diarist towards himself, Bennett is sensitive about exposing others. His elder brother Gordon prefers to be mentioned only minimally in plays and diaries, an absence that the writer explains in <em>The Alan Bennett Diaries</em>, an<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2016/sep/27/alan-bennetts-diaries-trailer-adam-low-video\" title=\"\"> Adam Low</a> documentary released next month. Has Gordon ever questioned any of his brother\u2019s family accounts? \u201cHe has a different view of some things. And he wouldn\u2019t come to see <em>Cocktail Sticks</em>. Not in a hostile way. He just thought it might be upsetting.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"994d0ed89b0c25df6d4fce9b52097b25c6553dda\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/994d0ed89b0c25df6d4fce9b52097b25c6553dda/0_133_2594_1556/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rupert Everett, left, and Julian Rhind-Tutt in Nicholas Hytner\u2019s 1994 film, The Mdness of King George,\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rupert Everett, left, and Julian Rhind-Tutt in Nicholas Hytner\u2019s 1994 film, <em>The Mdness of King George</em>,</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Channel 4</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The poet Philip Larkin, about whom Bennett made a TV programme, ordered his journals to be burned after his death. But Bennett\u2019s diaries are stocked for posterity in Oxford, so would he be content for the complete versions to be published posthumously? \u201cYes. I\u2019m OK with that. The person who would mind might be Rupert but, as he\u2019ll be my executor, he can decide.\u201d</p> <p>In the case of Larkin, every piece of writing he didn\u2019t destroy has subsequently been published. Such judgments may arise with the Bennett archive, which includes unmade film scripts and TV plays, including <em>Gay Night at Bangs</em>, written in the 1980s, before he came out publicly. \u201cAt the time, it would have been quite \u2026 well, not daring really, but quite on the edge. But not now,\u201d Bennett says. Would he leave instructions to prevent the play being staged by a fringe theatre in the future? \u201cOh, no no. It\u2019s in the public domain. Or, anyway, the Bodleian library. It wouldn\u2019t bother me. People do unexpected things with writing.\u201d</p> <p>He points out that writers may not be the best judges of their literary afterlife: TS Eliot would never have imagined <em>Old Possum\u2019s Book of Practical Cats</em> becoming the Andrew Lloyd Webber dance musical <em>Cats</em>, and Franz Kafka \u2013 about whom Bennett wrote a stage play, <em>Kafka\u2019s Dick</em>, and a TV script, <em>The Insurance Man</em> \u2013 would not be known as an author at all if his friend and executor, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/oct/15/franz-kafka-archive-public\" title=\"\">Max Brod</a>, had not ignored an instruction to destroy the unpublished works now regarded as classics.</p> <p>\u201cI think Kafka did and didn\u2019t want his work destroyed. Larkin the same. He wanted to be famous, but was always drawing back from it somehow.\u201d</p> <p>But you have a bit of that yourself?</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d A kindly laugh. \u201cPrecisely. But it all bothers me much less than it used to. I mean, if the new book does badly, it\u2019s sad. But it doesn\u2019t break your heart like it did when I was younger.\u201d</p> <p>One of the revelations of the latest diary entries, covering 2005-15, is that Bennett seems to be a keen and eclectic viewer of TV. \u201cWell, we tend to eat about nine o\u2019clock. So we&nbsp;watch whatever\u2019s on when we\u2019re having supper \u2026 And sometimes, when I\u2019m having my lunch, I watch a terrible programme: er, <em>Bargain Hunt</em>. The thing we don\u2019t watch is all those gloomy Scandinavian detective things.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Having a memorial service is the best sort of party, where you can be at the party without being there</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Readers may note that the celebrated playwright seems almost never to go to the theatre. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t,\u201d he admits. \u201cRupert doesn\u2019t get home until 8pm, which makes theatre difficult. But it\u2019s no loss. I don\u2019t mind.\u201d</p> <p>Bennett feels spoiled by the comfort of his years at the National, knowing where the best seats and nearest loos were, during a period when he worked with director<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/mar/13/alan-bennett-nicholas-hytner-national-theatre\" title=\"\"> Nicholas Hytner </a>on an adaptation of <em>The Wind in the Willows</em>, followed by a string of Bennett originals, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2011/aug/31/madness-george-theatre-bath-review\" title=\"\"><em>The Madness of George III</em> </a>and <em>The History Boys</em>, which lifted him to international theatrical and cinematic recognition.</p> <p>In a quarter of a century of collaborations, Bennett says that he has never had a creative disagreement with Hytner. \u201cNo. We probably should have done: it might have been beneficial for the plays. It\u2019s probably the way Nick works. He doesn\u2019t like rows and problems outside the play. There was some bother about money or rights with one of my plays and he didn\u2019t want to know. And I felt a bit bereft at that point. But I realised he doesn\u2019t like any kind of upset. That\u2019s the only criticism I\u2019d ever have of him.\u201d</p> <p>His throat tiring from talking, Bennett stands up to fetch a glass of water, and stumbles slightly. \u201cOoops. That\u2019s another thing that happens as you get older \u2013 you flop about more.\u201d</p> <p>Ageing is inevitably a theme of the new book, the diary entries pitted with the melancholy appointments of decline: colonoscopies, ultrasounds, funerals, memorial services.</p> <p>Bennett went to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/apr/20/victoria-wood-obituary\" title=\"\">Victoria Wood</a>\u2019s send-off in St James\u2019s, Piccadilly. \u201cYou didn\u2019t meet anyone who wasn\u2019t sorry. She was a nice woman and very funny off-stage as well. Although Alan Titchmarsh, who had been on programmes with her once or twice, said she very much knew what she wanted and could be quite stern with people about work, which is good.\u201d</p> <p>The best memorial service Bennett attended was in Westminster Abbey for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2003/mar/17/guardianobituaries.media\" title=\"\">Thora Hird</a>, who played various of his northern matriarchs, including Doris in the <em>Talking Heads</em> monologue <em>A Cream Cracker Under the Settee</em>. He acknowledges, though, that, for older attendees, there is an inevitable shadow over any obituary event: \u201cYou do start to see yourself there. Or not there. It wouldn\u2019t bother me, having a memorial service, in the sense that it\u2019s the best sort of party, where you can be at the party without being there.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"8d5e7b00925036ce8f2151b3698d7c4936dda93c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8d5e7b00925036ce8f2151b3698d7c4936dda93c/0_131_1615_2019/800.jpg\" alt=\"Maggie Smith in Talking Heads, Chichester, 2005.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Maggie Smith in <em>Talking Heads</em>, Chichester, 2005.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He describes himself as a \u201cparenthical Anglican\u201d, meaning the type of C of E member who brackets an undevout life with the rituals of baptism and burial. \u201cI\u2019d quite like a service,\u201d he confirms. \u201cBut the problem with religion in this house is that Rupert is so atheistical, although hymns make him cry from his childhood. So I don\u2019t know what he will do.\u201d</p> <p>A chilling anecdote in the new book concerns a passenger on the London-Leeds train explaining that he finds it strange to be sitting opposite Bennett because he picked the writer in an office sweepstake to predict the next celebrity to die. \u201cHe\u2019s stopped being on the train. So perhaps he\u2019s the one that\u2019s gone. What struck me was that he wasn\u2019t at all embarrassed about telling me. It was as if I should be flattered.\u201d</p> <p>Such an encounter would have finished off Larkin, who fretted away much of his life thinking about death. \u201cI do think about it a lot. But it doesn\u2019t paralyse me in the way that it did Larkin.\u201d</p> <p>Mention of the poet who lived and died in Hull tempts the Leeds-born Bennett into comments that may spark a civil war with Humberside: \u201cI know it sounds awful, but I find it quite difficult to take the notion of Hull as a European City of Culture. When we went \u2013 I think it was something to do with Larkin \u2013 we could only find one restaurant. It was a Pizza Hut, and it was locked. And they opened the door for us, and then locked it after us. That was a few years ago, though. It\u2019s probably changed a lot since then.\u201d</p> <p>As long as mental agility remains, there is no retirement age for writers. He still tries to work every weekday, though now in the afternoons (he used to be a mornings author) after a half-hour bike ride in Regent\u2019s Park: \u201cI find riding on the bike easier than walking now really.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I know it sounds awful, but I find it quite difficult to take the notion of Hull as a European City of Culture</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>He has various folders holding scraps of writing, but doesn\u2019t currently have a single idea that ignites. Surely the sweepstake guy on the train might be a promising subject? \u201cYes, you could write a story about that \u2026 I\u2019ll open a folder for it.\u201d He also knows that his audience would most like more <em>Talking Heads</em>: \u201cI\u2019ve got two that I could work on, but they\u2019re both so gloomy. I can\u2019t make them funny. I\u2019m quite happy if I leave them behind. Someone else can do them.\u201d</p> <p>What he has, he feels, is less writer\u2019s block than author\u2019s caution. \u201cYou do it and you feel it\u2019s not up to what you\u2019ve done before. What you\u2019ve done before is in some ways a comfort, but it\u2019s also an examination board that you\u2019re failing to pass with the stuff that you\u2019re doing now. But maybe one had always felt that. You just have to keep going and see if it turns into anything.\u201d</p> <p>Hytner, having retired as artistic director of the National, is opening a new 900-seater venue, the London Theatre Company, beside the Thames next year, and there has been a widespread assumption that a Bennett play will be part of the schedules.</p> <p>\u201cWell, he\u2019s not asked me,\u201d Bennett says. \u201cAnd I feel, after 25 years, he probably deserves a break from me. I\u2019m sure that, if I wrote something, he\u2019d look at it and consider it. But his priority is getting the theatre up and running.\u201d</p> <p>The playwright, though, is still back at his desk every afternoon. \u201cThere\u2019s always something going on. I write scenes, and then can\u2019t quite see what to do with them. I&nbsp;wish I understood the actual writing process better than I&nbsp;do. There\u2019s a story about Harold Pinter ringing [director] Peter Hall, and saying \u2018I\u2019m pregnant.\u2019 Meaning there was a play on the way. The notion of knowing that you\u2019re pregnant! I wouldn\u2019t know until I\u2019d actually had it. To know that there was something there - I\u2019ve never had that!\u201d</p> <p>And according to the rhythm he has established since <em>Writing Home</em>, there should be fourth volume of diaries and pieces in around 2026-27? One of the most distinctive voices in English literature is at its most beautifully, musically lugubrious as he replies: \u201cYes, that\u2019s right. But I would think it would be very unlikely.\u201d</p> <p>The documentary <em>Alan Bennett\u2019s Diaries</em> will be shown in UK cinemas on 16&nbsp;November and on BBC2 in December.</p>",

Now it\u2019s about violence and rape and death: we\u2019ve got down to the nitty-gritty.\u201d Earlier this month, when she spoke at&#xa0;the <a href=\"http://www.southbankcentre.co.uk/whatson/festivals-series/london-literature-festival?gclid=CjwKEAjwhILABRDwo8mlqt6ug38SJACNSq_kIM90R5cOL9yG603aGdq-ldofuRvvMooMmaqKp-IJiBoCwW7w_wcB\" title=\"\">Southbank literature festival</a> in London, she talked about \u201cthe most amazingly vicious online abuse\u201d of women. \u201cWhat&#xa0;century are we in?\u201d she&#xa0;asked. \u201cApparently, the 12th.\u201d</p> <p>When The Handmaid\u2019s Tale was published, she says, the novel was reviewed by British critics as an enjoyable fantasy, and by the Canadians with a certain anxiety (\u201cCould it happen here?\u201d). In America, though, there was a sense of: \u201c\u2018How long have we got?\u2019\u201d She sighs. \u201cApparently, not as long as I thought \u2026 With any cultural change there is a push and a pushback. Trump has brought out a huge pushback that was originally against immigrants. Now it has shifted to being very misogynistic, partly because of Hillary Clinton. You have not seen anything like this since the 17th-century witchhunts, quite frankly.\u201d</p> <p>Can you understand the appeal of&#xa0;Trump, I ask? \u201cHe brings out the temper-tantrum-throwing wilful brat in all of us. \u2018Why can\u2019t I do what I want? Why can\u2019t I have what I want? Those other people are stopping me. Those other people have a bigger lollipop that I do, I\u2019m going to take their lollipop away from them.\u2019 But on the other hand, he couples that with the most amazing whining.\u201d She mentions the complaint by Trump that his microphone malfunctioned during the first televised presidential debate. (\u201cRubbish.\u201d)</p> <p>\u201cI tell you this,\u201d she continues. \u201cHillary Clinton is a better man than Trump. She has more connection to the traditional male virtues. She has comported herself in a much more manly fashion. Ask any real alpha males that you\u2019ll know and they\u2019ll say of Trump, \u2018This is the guy we&#xa0;didn\u2019t like at school because he was a&#xa0;bully, but as soon as anyone pushed back at him he started to whine.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>What does she think, then, of Clinton\u2019s campaign? \u201cWell, it\u2019s more of a&#xa0;campaign. Trump has taken about 10 different positions on everything, so there is no way of knowing what he really thinks. You actually just don\u2019t know. He will adopt a position depending on what reaction is mirrored back to him. Basically, it\u2019s very close to being a manifestation of a mob: burn them at the stake, screaming and yelling.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"59cd16e301a7d46db8f812312aa7e5e1e88a3828\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/59cd16e301a7d46db8f812312aa7e5e1e88a3828/0_0_1400_2250/622.jpg\" alt=\"Hag-Seed by Margaret Atwood, a retelling of Shakespeare\u2019s The Tempest\" width=\"622\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hag-Seed by Margaret Atwood, a retelling of Shakespeare\u2019s The Tempest.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Penguin</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/oct/30/salem-witch-trials-american-imagination\" title=\"\">the Salem witch trials</a>, then? She proceeds to talk about them: Atwood likes to take a long historical sweep. Her heroes of this tragic episode, dramatised by Arthur Miller in The Crucible, are Rebecca Nurse, who refused to admit that she was a witch and declined to accuse others, meaning she was hanged; and Giles Corey, who refused to plead at his trial, meaning that he was pressed \u2013 that is, crushed by heavy stones until his lungs collapsed and he died. By sacrificing himself thus, and not allowing his case to be tried, his family inherited his property, which otherwise would have been confiscated.</p> <p>However, she says, after a fairly long disquisition on the legal history of 17th-century Massachusetts, this is not at all what the Trump situation is like. \u201cSalem was much more dignified \u2026 Salem at least had rules for the trials.\u201d She hunts around for a better comparison. It\u2019s like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2011/dec/08/favourite-film-night-of-the-hunter\" title=\"\">Night of the Hunter</a>, she says. \u201cRobert Mitchum. Directed by Charles Laughton. Just a great film. At the end they catch this guy who\u2019s been murdering women and has been trying to get hold of some children to kill them too. He is seen off <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t-konY4cHE\" title=\"\">by Lillian Gish</a> playing an old lady in a rocking chair with a shotgun.\u201d (A sudden vision arrives, unbidden, of Atwood in a&#xa0;rocking chair with a shotgun.) \u201cShe peppers him with shot, he gets caught and put in jail and there\u2019s a mob outside who want to lynch him. So the very same Christian, righteous people who have played the virtuous townspeople are now screaming for his blood. This is what it\u2019s like. Those mob scenes at Trump rallies: burn her, lock her up, kill&#xa0;her. They think they are at the wrestling, but let those people out, and&#xa0;you have a lynchmob.\u201d</p> <p>We turn to the scenarios she sketched in the MaddAddam trilogy: a world of internet insecurity, pig-human hybrids, environmental devastation, oil fetishists and complete corporate takeover of states. Do dystopian novels, I wonder, actually do anything? Can they change behaviour? They are, she says, more like weathervanes than guides on averting disaster. \u201cAll dystopian novels are telling you to do is make sure you\u2019ve got a lot of canned goods and a gun.\u201d Do you have canned goods and a gun in Toronto? \u201cI\u2019m too freaking old. I\u2019m probably not going to make it through the zombie apocalypse anyway.\u201d</p> <p>The literary news, as we speak, has been recently all about the \u201cunmasking\u201d by an Italian investigative journalist of the real identity of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/03/the-guardian-view-on-unmasking-elena-ferrante-an-impoverishing-act\" title=\"\">Elena Ferrante</a>, the pseudonymous author of the hugely popular Neapolitan novels. \u201cShe probably went too far in putting out a fake autobiography. Which is like an invitation: expose me,\u201d says Atwood. (She is referring to Frantumaglia, which is about to be published in English \u2013 not an autobiography as such, but a collection of letters, essays, interviews and the like.) \u201cBut she\u2019s not committed a crime. Nor do I feel that she was a bad person to write under a pseudonym. She did what she wanted to do. It worked spectacularly well, and then there are the books. People will read them a bit differently, that\u2019s inevitable. But it doesn\u2019t make them bad books.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"57906cd966d08edc93eb2266720a9918fdda3df9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/57906cd966d08edc93eb2266720a9918fdda3df9/0_0_4005_3080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Margaret Atwood in 1972.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"769\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I used to go on the Greyhound bus with copies of my books in a cardboard box, and give readings in school gymnasiums\u2019 \u2026 Margaret Atwood in 1972.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ron Bull/Toronto Star via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Atwood herself published pseudonymously a bit, when she was young \u2013 in the student magazine, to fill the pages. And she wrote a comic strip under another name in the 1970s.

Invisibility is&#xa0;not her thing: especially when she, and Canadian fellow writers, worked so&#xa0;hard in the 1970s to improve their own visibility. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m entitled to whinge too much, because it\u2019s my fault. I used to go on the Greyhound bus&#xa0;with copies of my books in a cardboard box, and give readings in school gymnasiums. I\u2019d sell my own books and collect the money, put it in a brown paper envelope and take it back to the publisher.\u201d She looks at me with wide eyes. \u201cWhat sort of a wimp are you?

Critics say Samarco \u2013 a joint venture between mining giants Vale and BHP Billiton \u2013 just wants to cover over the mess and reopen the mine.</p> <p>There\u2019s certainly a financial incentive to resume operations. In August BHP announced a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/16/bhp-makes-record-loss-after-commodity-rout-and-brazil-disaster\">record loss of $6.4bn</a> (\u00a35.2bn), due to the dam collapse as well as a slump in commodity prices. A month later Samarco said it wanted to restructure debts after <a href=\"http://www.samarco.com/en/investidores/\" rel=\"nofollow\">failing to make a $13.4m</a> payment.</p> <p>\u201cAll Samarco\u2019s effort is focused on a return to its activities and not on society and environmental recuperation,\u201d says Carlos Pinto, coordinator of a group of environmental prosecutors in the state of Minas Gerais, where the tragedy happened.</p> <p>Yet Da Silva says Samarco is doing a good job \u2013 and has quickly reopened roads and rebuilt a nearby bridge after the disaster. The company pays the rent for a nearby house where they live and has promised to build them a new home \u2013 just as it has agreed to build new communities to replace the villages destroyed.</p> <p>\u201cWe have to hope for their goodwill,\u201d says Da Silva.</p> <p>Not all local residents share their optimism. Ivaldil de Souza, 73, farmed cattle on 300 hectares of land nearby until the mud flooded across his land and reached up to the veranda of the house. He has yet to receive an indemnity promised in August and is angry about the Samarco\u2019s planting of fast-growing plants to secure the mud around his house.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1bb1d7d97248047723014270728f271e2e32c422\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1bb1d7d97248047723014270728f271e2e32c422/0_0_4000_2664/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ivaldil de Souza\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ivaldil de Souza.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dom Phillips</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThey said would come and plant other things.

A Samarco spokeswoman says that planting on top of the mud was an emergency measure being monitored for its effectiveness to reduce erosion and the mud being swept away.</p> <p>Behind his house, where three metre-high tidemarks stain dead trees, Samarco workmen have secured the banks of a stream with netting and rocks, and rerouted it around what had been a lake.</p> <p>\u201cWhy did they change the river?\u201d De Souza asks.</p> <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> <p>In July, Brazil\u2019s federal environment agency Ibama published a <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.ibama.gov.br/phocadownload/noticias_ambientais/relatorio_fase_helios_operacao_augias.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">report</a> that criticised Samarco\u2019s environmental recuperation works and questioned its recovery of rivers, noting that at times their routes had even been changed. </p> <p>\u201cFrom the environmental point of view, this is worrying,\u201d says Gustavo de Oliveira, Ibama\u2019s general coordinator for recuperation in the area.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Samarco\u2019s spokeswoman said the company had recuperated 61 tributaries and endeavoured to keep to original courses. In some cases where the original route could not be found or the \u201chydrological dynamic\u201d determined a change, adjustments had been made. The company had spent 650m reais (\u00a3166m) on recuperation works by June this year.</p> <p>In March, Samarco, Vale and BHP Billiton signed an agreement with the federal government for socioeconomic and environmental recovery work worth a total of around 20bn reais (\u00a35bn) over 15 years.</p> <p>The company will finance the recovery of 5,000 streams along the River Doce, reforest 10,000 hectares and restore another 30,000 hectares. In August it launched the Renova (Renew) Foundation to carry out the work. However, the agreement is now in legal limbo after a <strong tabindex=\"-1\"> </strong>high court judge suspended the settlement. </p> <p>In May federal prosecutors in Minas Gerais <a href=\"http://fundaoinvestigation.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">launched a separate legal action</a> for 155bn reais (\u00a340bn) in damages \u2013 a figure <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2016/may/04/bhp-billiton-compensation-brazil-dam-disaster\">based on the amount paid by BP</a> after the Deepwater Horizon disaster.</p> <p>\u201cThe tragedy of Mariana revealed a series of failures of planning, of control and of risk management,\u201d prosecutors said in a statement at the time. </p> <p>All parties have now begun a conciliation process. Samarco says it is continuing to meet the terms of the agreement while it awaits a resolution.</p> <p>And Samarco\u2019s problems are multiplying. In June, <a href=\"http://g1.globo.com/minas-gerais/desastre-ambiental-em-mariana/noticia/2016/06/pf-conclui-inquerito-da-tragedia-de-mariana-e-indicia-8-pessoas.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">an investigation by Brazil\u2019s federal police</a> concluded the company knew the dam was at risk before it collapsed. Drainage was a problem, the report said, as was the constant heightening of the dam which was not properly monitored. The police recommended charges against eight people.</p> <p>In August, Samarco published an independent report commissioned from US law firm Cleary Gottlieb Steen &amp; Hamilton. This deeply technical <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://fundaoinvestigation.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">study</a> concluded that the dam collapsed after the liquefaction of iron ore mining waste caused by the interaction between two types of tailings \u2013 sands and slimes \u2013 and \u201cunplanned occurrences\u201d during its construction and operation. A minor earthquake on the day of the disaster may have \u201caccelerated the failure process that was already well-advanced\u201d, the report concluded.</p> <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> <p>Samarco has already been fined 250m reals (\u00a364m) by Ibama and 112m reais (\u00a328m) by the Minas Gerais state government\u2019s environment agency, Semad. It is appealing all the fines and has yet to pay any of them, Samarco\u2019s spokeswoman says.</p> <p>More controversy surrounds Samarco\u2019s plan to secure the millions of cubic meters of mining waste still left in the complex \u2013 a series of dykes, of which three have been built.</p> <p>The fourth will flood part of the mud-covered area where the village of Bento Rodrigues once was.

  "<p><br></p> <p>British households are failing to recycle as many as 16m plastic bottles every day \u2013 a \u201cstaggering\u201d number and nearly half the total of more than 35m which are used and discarded daily \u2013 according to new research.</p> <p>Based on the data published on Saturday, the <a href=\"http://www.recyclenow.com/\">Recycle Now </a>campaign group suggests that the number of bottles evading recycling in the UK could reach 29bn by the end of 2020, putting huge pressure on landfill and with dire consequences for marine life. </p> <p>Every year the average UK household uses 480 plastic bottles, but only recycles 270 of them, meaning nearly half (44%) are not put into recycling facilities, according to Recycle Now, a campaign group funded by the government\u2019s waste advisory group <a href=\"http://www.wrap.org.uk/about-us/about\">Wrap</a>. </p> <p>On a national basis, that means an average of 35.8m plastic bottles are used every day, but only 19.8m are recycled each day. So an average of 16m plastic bottles a day are not being recycled and are ending up in landfill \u2013 and eventually the world\u2019s oceans, where they will take years to break down.</p> <p> \u2018Single use\u2019 plastic bottles containing mineral water and soft drinks are commonly blamed for contributing to litter and adding to landfill, said Recycle Now, but plastic bottles used in the home are also a problem. The group blamed consumer ignorance and unjustified fears about contamination for failing to recycle containers used for bleach, household cleaners and other liquids. <br></p> <p>\u201cThe number of plastic bottles not being recycled is staggering and will increase further if we don\u2019t take action,\u201d said Alice Harlock of Recycle Now. \u201cHouseholders are often unsure if items are recyclable, especially from the bathroom, bedroom and living room. An easy way to tell is, if an item is plastic and bottle shaped its recyclable.\u201d<br></p> <p>Commonly used items people do nor realise are recyclable include empty bleach, shampoo and conditioner receptacles as well as bathroom and kitchen cleaners and soap dispenser bottles. Generally, only bottles containing chemicals such as anti-freeze should not be recycled. </p> <p>Conservation groups and marine charities have warned of the environmental dangers of plastic bottles, which can take up to 500 years to break down once in the sea. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"492c6ec861b677bc710371b9fe1c1dfc82ee421a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/492c6ec861b677bc710371b9fe1c1dfc82ee421a/0_0_4698_3132/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Plastic and driftwood washed up on Pembrey sands beach, Carmarthenshire, Wales\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Plastic and driftwood washed up on Pembrey sands beach, Carmarthenshire, Wales.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paul Quayle/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>More than 8,000 plastic bottles were collected by the Marine Conservation Society\u2019s annual beach clean-up at seaside locations from Orkney to the Channel Islands <a href=\"http://www.mcsuk.org/beachwatch/greatbritishbeachclean\">on one weekend last September</a>. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/mar/23/uk-beach-litter-rises-by-a-third-report-finds\">The charity\u2019s annual report</a> published this year revealed a 34% rise in beach litter overall between 2014 and 2015, the largest ever amount of litter per kilometre (3,298 pieces).</p> <p>\u201cWe need to challenge ourselves when it comes to what we could be recycling,\u201d said Harlock. \u201cEvery plastic bottle counts.

  "<p>As a maths teacher, I\u2019m often asked by students: \u201cwhen will I ever need to use this in real life?\u201d. I always try my best to answer. I tell them that, yes, actually, when you\u2019re cooking, understanding ratios is very useful. Or, if you want to work as a plumber, you will find yourself calculating the area, volume and capacity of shapes. But recently, I find myself avoiding their questions. The honest answer is: you will almost certainly never use this again.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/teacher-network/2016/oct/08/secret-teacher-students-arent-friends-mate-discipline\">Secret Teacher: students aren't your friends, so don't call them 'mate'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There\u2019s always a risk that the maths taught in schools is too removed from real life. But the new syllabus for maths GCSE, introduced last year, has made things worse. Students sitting the paper are expected to become experts in complicated and high-level maths, even if they\u2019re sitting a foundation paper where the maximum grade is a 4 or 5 (the equivalent to a C). It leaves students disillusioned and leaves less time to concentrate on the key numeracy skills they will actually need as adults.</p> <p>Here are a few of the topics students sitting a foundation maths paper are expected to understand: working with standard form; laws of indices; highest common factors and lowest common multiples; quadratic equations; quadratic graphs; quadratic sequences; angles in polygons; angles on parallel lines; Pythagoras\u2019 theorem; vectors; area and perimeter of circle sectors; tree diagrams; set notation; solving algebraic inequalities and much, much more. What percentage of people in the country need to know even half of that to get by and thrive?</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I\u2019m convinced a smaller syllabus, and fewer maths lessons, would help more students enjoy and benefit from maths</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I\u2019d love to meet the employer who insists all their employees need to be able write 72 as a product of its prime factors. Who is suggesting that all school leavers need to be able to factorise the expression 7y \u2013 21y<sup>2</sup>? Why does everyone in the country need to be able see a right angled triangle with a hypotenuse of length 4m and a side of length 3m and immediately work out the angle between these two sides. If you\u2019re going on to study maths or sciences at A-level, then this is all necessary knowledge \u2013 but it\u2019s highly unlikely those sitting a foundation maths syllabus will continue the subject post-16.</p> <p>Ensuring all school leavers are numerate and confident with everyday maths should be a main priority in education. We should be making sure all pupils can add, subtract, multiply and divide, use a calculator properly and estimate answers to avoid the need of a calculator and/or check its output. Pupils should be able to understand bills, costs, profit and loss. They need to understand enough about probability to evaluate the risk of things happening. Pupils should also understand the basics about common 2D and 3D shapes, and be confident with other numeracy skills that will be useful in life.</p> <p>I\u2019m convinced a smaller syllabus, and fewer maths lessons, would help more students enjoy and benefit from maths. It would lead to more engaged pupils and free up time to study other subjects.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/teacher-network/2016/oct/01/secret-teaching-i-love-teaching-but-im-tired-of-feeling-like-a-failure\">Secret Teacher: I love teaching, but I'm tired of feeling like a failure</a> </p> </aside>  <p> At the moment, pupils spend as much time on their maths (worth one GCSE) as on their English (worth two GCSEs), and almost as much as on science (worth two or three GCSEs). For students who dislike the subject, this volume of lessons is counter-productive. Try keeping up their enthusiasm when you have a class of young people who have no choice but to spend one hour a day, four days a week (plus homework) studying a subject they struggle with. I don\u2019t know how I\u2019d react if I was made to spend that long doing art or technology each week.</p> <p> Some argue that we\u2019re \u201censuring a rigorous education\u201d by setting such an academic curriculum. I disagree. Ensuring tests are rigorous is only worthwhile if the skills being tested are useful. We shouldn\u2019t be testing knowledge for knowledge\u2019s sake. <br></p> <p> As is the case with all subjects, some students find maths hard. That\u2019s not necessarily a bad thing and it\u2019s certainly not an admission of failure. As a teacher, helping these pupils get a good grade is often more rewarding than helping those who find it easier. But I want my students to find lessons both enjoyable and useful \u2013 and I worry that they\u2019re neither. </p> <p><strong>Follow us on Twitter via <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GuardianTeach\">@GuardianTeach</a>.

There\u2019s something about the crumpled-duvet landscapes of emerald field and heathery fell, about encountering its sudden, Shire-like valleys threaded with muscular peat rivers, about stumbling across a ruined abbey at dusk or drinking well-earned beers by pub fires that forever sticks in the head and the heart.</p> <p>One of the national park\u2019s greatest pubs has to be the <a href=\"http://www.craven-cruckbarn.co.uk/\">Craven Arms</a> at Appletreewick (mains from \u00a38.95).

Carry on through meadows where lapwings \u201cpee-wit\u201d and a stray foot may startle a hare into pulsing flight, to reach Burnsall and what has to be the most photographed bridge in the dales. Cross the river and follows signs for Appletreewick, and find the Craven Arms close to the Mock Beggar Hall, an old monastic grange that testifies to the village\u2019s connection to nearby Bolton Abbey. Below the pub is a fantastic wild swimming spot.</p> <p>The five and half miles back are most atmospheric if you time it to arrive in Grassington at dusk. Return to Burnsall and then take the historic riverside path north-west, crossing the suspension bridge at Hebden. Along the way enjoy woodsmoke from farmhouse chimneys; the quiet grandeur of autumnal trees bronzed by late light, ground mist around their roots; the gurgling rush and calm of the river; and the unforgettable, far-reaching fells, alive with the bleats of Swaledale sheep, gradually bruising into black.<br><strong>Rob Cowen, author of </strong><strong><a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/common-ground-371780.html\">Common Ground</a> (Cornerstone)</strong><strong>, voted one of the </strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2015/dec/11/readers-top-10-best-books-of-2015\"><strong>Guardian readers\u2019 top 10 books of 2015</strong></a></p> <h2>2 Nidd Gorge, North Yorkshire</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"872da68aa4408dce33df9efb8d36f69c61a09258\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/872da68aa4408dce33df9efb8d36f69c61a09258/125_144_4483_2690/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Nidd at Knaresborough.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Nidd at Knaresborough.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: carriagesknaresborough.co.uk</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Length: 7</strong>\u00bd<strong><sup> </sup>miles<br></strong><strong>Time: 3</strong>\u00bd<strong> hours<br>Start/finish: Sustrans 67 junction with Bilton Lane (Google <a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/54%C2%B000'48.6%22N+1%C2%B031'23.7%22W/@54.0135,-1.5254387,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x0!8m2!3d54.0135!4d-1.52325\">map</a></strong><strong>/OS Explorer 297)<br>Grade: Moderate<br>Refuel: </strong><a href=\"http://www.carriagesknaresborough.co.uk/\"><strong>Carriages</strong></a><strong>, Knaresborough</strong></p> <p>Autumn\u2019s true glories are experienced through trees: the turning of leaves from greens to fiery yellows and reds; the wine-black clusters of berries and nuts on drooping branches; the musty smell of leaf litter as shafts of sun streak the damp earth.</p> <p>A mile from my home on the northern edge of Harrogate, a thickly wooded river gorge provides the perfect stage to witness the splendour of autumn.</p> <p>Enter the Nidd Gorge by following the <a href=\"http://www.sustrans.org.uk/ncn/map/route/route-67\">Sustrans cycleway 67</a> from Bilton to the defunct Victorian viaduct that spans the river.

Today, a handful of fishermen catch whelks, scallops and lobsters, and the Ty Coch is the only pub. The landlord, Stuart Webley and his family are the beach\u2019s last permanent residents.</p> <p>An excellent circular (clockwise) walk to Porthdinllaen starts in the inland village of Edern (park by the Ship Inn). Take the footpath from the wooden footbridge next to the butcher\u2019s shop along the western bank of the Afon Geirch. Head north in the direction of the coast. Cross the stream in front of Porthdynllaen Farm and follow it until you meet the farm track, then hard left until you pick up the footpath again on the other side of the farmyard.</p> <p>Pass by the campsite at the farm and follow the river, now on its eastern bank, to the rocky beach at Abergeirch. Stone steps will take you to the cliff path \u2013 the Wales Coast Path. A colony of seals live off the rocks at Life Boat Bay. When mackerel are in season it\u2019s not unusual to see a pod of dolphins from the cliff. Rejoin the beach at Life Boat Bay and follow the coastal path to the Ty Coch.</p> <p>Proud to be a chip-free zone, the Ty Coch provides carbs in a superb list of bottled craft beers, two local tap beers and a revolving guest ale. The saloon is the beach, with a great view of Anglesey, though you\u2019d be surprised how many people can cram inside when it rains.</p> <p>After lunch continue along the beach to Morfa Nefyn, enjoying superb views of the Yr Eifl hills until the road meets the beach below the Cliffs pub. Walk straight over at the crossroads, then turn right at the T-junction and take the footpath along the B4417 back into Edern. An alternative that avoids the road is to cut back across the golf course and follow the coastal path back to Abergeirch.

Great jetties like a giant\u2019s extended fingers reach out into the river all around you, and then, having probably not seen a soul all morning, you arrive at a caravan park and then a pub in quick succession. You are just about halfway round the island by now. The pub is the <a href=\"http://www.thelobstersmackcanveyisland.co.uk/\">Lobster Smack</a>, which is pretty and wooden from the outside and cosy inside, with decent pub grub. I had the beer-battered cod and chips (\u00a39.79) accompanied by a pint of Blue Moon (without a slice of orange).</p> <p>If the landscape so far reminds you of every TV adaptation you\u2019ve ever seen of Great Expectations and you\u2019ve found it hard to shake off the image of Abel Magwitch being pursued across the mudflats, it\u2019s not surprising, because the Lobster Smack is the inn in the Dickens novel.</p> <p>Restored, press on round the island, following the sea wall with its vibrant graffiti, past the lure of amusement arcades and a small beach.

At Holkham, you can turn through the pines on to the vast beach and head back east to Wells, keeping an eye out for seals, oystercatchers and other shoreline birds.</p> <p>This is a particularly beautiful walk in autumn and winter, when there is more chance of encountering coastal wildlife. And even when it is busy, you can always find space and solitude on such an expanse of sand. My tip is to check the wind direction when you set out and do this walk whichever way round ensures that the wind is at your back on the beach.</p> <p>After a fresh-air buffeting, you may require some refreshment; follow the coast path up the channel to the port of Wells, where you\u2019ll find the <a href=\"http://albatroswells.co.uk/\">Albatros</a> moored on the Quay.

The dunes and woods on the landward side are great for fungi in autumn (including the beautiful if poisonous fly agaric) and sparrowhawks or buzzards in all seasons.</p> <p>After four miles you see the hamlet of Horsey with the Nelson Head. It is the first and only settlement north of Winterton. A clear track on the left, leading west into Horsey, takes you directly to it. For an alternative way back stroll by the sea and take in the fabulous gatherings of grey seals as you walk.

Now I can both exercise my right to roam on the same route, and stop off for lunch at the <a href=\"http://thebeehiveinn.co.uk/\">Beehive Inn</a>.</p> <p>The first leg of the Combs Moss circuit is a great appetite builder. It is easy to park at the top of Lightwood Road in Buxton and then follow the gravel track to the bridge over a small brook and climb the steep facing slope. Then the route heads north-east, following the boundary line and gritstone wall, known as Black Edge, that divides the heather moorland from the upland pastures.</p> <p>There is a sense of vast space, and glorious panoramas over the heart of the Peak District. Then, as you drop off the moor to the minor road above Combs Edge and make the last steep descent into Combs and the Beehive itself, you can see, way to the north, the darker contours of Kinder Scout and Blackden Moor.</p> <p>Avoid retracing your steps by undertaking a post-lunch slog up Ridge Lane and back to Buxton via the old Roman road, completing an eight-mile circuit. You are largely walking on an old gravel and even tarmac road, so the route is clear and the going good. It gets a little tougher with the years and over time I have seen the lapwings and curlews decline, yet the buzzards, peregrines and ravens are all increasing. The varied colours of autumn vegetation seen from this route are particularly rewarding.</p> <p>The fact that the Beehive pub is always busy despite being down a virtual cul-de-sac in the tiny hamlet of Combs, miles from the main road, speaks volumes for the friendliness of the staff and the reputation of its food and cask ale. It has a wood-lined interior with superb photos of local Derbyshire characters on the walls. There is an excellent range of traditional fare, but the generous Sunday roasts (\u00a310.95; the beef was particularly good last time) with heaps of fresh vegetables have long been a stock choice of my family. <strong>MC</strong></p> <h2>17 North Down Coastal Path, County Down</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"206d9e519eef1c2e4f88c8b19f28c54a075356d1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/206d9e519eef1c2e4f88c8b19f28c54a075356d1/0_258_5128_3077/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Crawfordsburn country park.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Crawfordsburn country park.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Length: 9 miles <br>Time: 4 hours <br>Start: Holywood station (Google </strong><strong><a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/54%C2%B038'37.6%22N+5%C2%B050'21.3%22W/@54.6437771,-5.8414307,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x0!8m2!3d54.643774!4d-5.839242\">map</a></strong><strong>/OSNI Discover 15</strong><strong>)<br></strong><strong>Finish: Seacliff Road, Bangor (Google </strong><a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/54%C2%B039'56.2%22N+5%C2%B040'00.1%22W/@54.6656121,-5.6688897,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x0!8m2!3d54.665609!4d-5.666701\"><strong>map</strong></a><strong>) Grade: Moderate<br></strong><strong>Refuel: </strong><a href=\"http://saltydogbangor.com/\">The Salty Dog</a><strong>, Bangor</strong></p> <p>From busy marinas to quiet sandy beaches, this trip along the shore of Belfast Lough is a celebration of the coastal diversity a stone\u2019s throw from the capital.

Avoid temptation at the start, however, and instead follow the riverside path around the back of the restaurant.

But whether May hates the \u201cmetropolitan elite\u201d quite as much as the Mail does is an open question.</p> <p>On the morning of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/05/mays-conservative-party-conference-speech-key-points-analysed\" title=\"\">her big speech to the Tory conference</a>, the Mail\u2019s front-page report predicted that she would condemn this elite, which it also called the \u201cliberal elite\u201d, \u201cfor sneering at millions of ordinary Britons over immigration\u201d. But her speech, when she delivered it, wasn\u2019t quite so straightforward. Many politicians and commentators, she told her audience, had found \u201cyour patriotism distasteful, your concerns about immigration parochial, your views about crime illiberal, your attachment to your job security inconvenient\u201d. But the only mention of an elite came in an earlier passage about the many \u201cpeople in positions of power\u201d who behaved as if they had \u201cmore in common with international elites than with the people down the road, the people they employ, the people they pass in the street\u201d. And then she added: \u201cBut if you believe you\u2019re a citizen of the world, you\u2019re a citizen of nowhere.\u201d</p> <p>In one or two paragraphs, she had taken aim at various kinds of elites and allegedly elitist attitudes, some antithetical to others and the most awkward of them probably invented for the sake of political balance \u2013 for which politician or commentator has ever openly complained about the \u201cinconvenience\u201d of a worker\u2019s attachment to job security?</p> <p>Two broad categories had been conflated and confused. First came the rich and greedy international elite, who ran businesses that didn\u2019t pay proper taxes and treated their workers badly. Second came a social and cultural elite who peered down their noses at the illiberalism and flag-waving of the classes below.</p> <p>Both groups could be smeared as citizens of nowhere \u2013 \u201crootless cosmopolitans\u201d in the antisemitic jibe of Stalin\u2019s Soviet Union \u2013 but other than that they have little or nothing in common. Ruthless billionaires on the one hand, condescending academics on the other: together, May implied, they had alienated the larger part of an electorate that felt wronged and ignored.</p> <p>There\u2019s nothing new in her diagnosis. Shortly before he died in 1994, the American historian and moralist <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/15/obituaries/christopher-lasch-is-dead-at-61-wrote-about-america-s-malaise.html\" title=\"\">Christopher Lasch</a> wrote an eloquent charge sheet against similar targets in his posthumously published book The Revolt of the Elites. He mainly described the United States, but his analysis illuminates many other parts of the world (including the land of Brexit) as well.</p> <p>What went wrong? Lasch: \u201cThe general course of recent history no longer favours the levelling of social distinctions but runs more and more in the direction of a two-class society.\u201d What he called the \u201cdemocratisation of abundance\u201d \u2013 the expectation that each generation would be better off than its predecessor \u2013 was giving way to a society of rising inequalities.</p> <p>How did this happen? When the idea that the masses were riding the wave of history faded away. The radical movements of the 20th century have failed, and the industrial working class, once the mainstay of the socialist movement, has been weakened to the point where, in some of its former strongholds, it barely exists anymore.</p> <p>Who are the elites? \u201cThose who control the international flow of money and information, preside over philanthropic foundations and institutions of higher learning, manage the instruments of cultural production and thus set the terms of public debate.\u201d</p> <p>A Marxist could have written those last words; the Daily Mail, in its anti-Philip (\u201c<a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3784214/Still-working-hard-Sir-Shifty-Philip-Green-relaxes-shore-family-luxury-yacht-docks-Monaco.html\" title=\"\">Sir Shifty</a>\u201d) Green and anti-metropolitan moments, could almost have written it.</p> <p>As a social critic rather than an ideologue, Lasch is hard to place on the left-right spectrum. Sometimes he might be depicting the present-day dilemma of a constituency Labour party in the north of England, as when he points out that the class once regarded as the most likely to support a revolution has many members with political instincts more conservative than those of their radical would-be leaders.</p> <p>Elsewhere he could be describing a way of London living that in 1994 still lay a dozen years in the future: \u201cAmbitious people understand \u2026 that a migratory way of life is the price of getting ahead \u2026 \u2018multiculturalism\u2019 suits them to perfection, conjuring up an agreeable image of a global bazaar \u2026 Theirs is essentially a tourist\u2019s view of the world.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The Daily Mail\u2019s portrayal of remainers as truculent and bitter has a few grains of truth</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Reading Lasch at this time of crisis in British history is also valuable as a caution. He writes that when the common folk confront well-meaning initiatives from above, their resistance provokes an outburst of \u201cthe venomous hatred that lies not far beneath the smiling face of upper-middle-class benevolence\u201d.</p> <p>I don\u2019t think of myself as upper-middle-class, but that might be a caricature of my emotions when, say, I watch Brexiteers on Question Time. The Daily Mail\u2019s portrayal of remainers as truculent and bitter has a few grains of truth. Nobody can look at something they see as a catastrophe and not despair of the people who caused it.</p> <p>Speaking of whom, let us count the public schools and the frequent mention of the same university. Nigel Farage (Dulwich College), <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/29/daniel-hannan-the-man-who-brought-you-brexit\" title=\"\">Daniel Hannan</a> (Marlborough and Oxford), Douglas Carswell (Charterhouse and UEA), Mark Reckless (Charterhouse and Oxford), David Cameron (Eton and Oxford), George Osborne (St Paul\u2019s and Oxford), Boris Johnson (Eton and Oxford), Michael Gove (Robert Gordon\u2019s College and Oxford), John Redwood (Kent College, Canterbury and Oxford), <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3636261/For-30-years-senior-Tory-BILL-CASH-derided-tirelessly-warning-EU-corrupt-superstate-dominated-Germany-events-prove-right-case-against-Brussels-behemoth.html\" title=\"\">Bill Cash</a> (Stonyhurst and Oxford), Matthew Elliott (Leeds Grammar and LSE), <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/apr/20/accuracy-is-for-snake-oil-pussies-vote-leaves-campaign-director-defies-mps\" title=\"\">Dominic Cummings</a> (Durham School and Oxford).</p> <p>That looks like an elite to me. More than that \u2013 it looks like a ruling class. In its whiteness, maleness and connectedness it could have ruled Britain in 1955. I imagine its members not as a caricature but as an old-fashioned cartoon: boys in school caps and short trousers lighting a little firework labelled \u201cSovereignty\u201d next to a huge pile of tinder marked \u201cAll Our Discontents\u201d.

She concluded that FirstPort had failed to comply with legislation designed to protect leaseholders, and that residents were overcharged and receiving a poor service in return. \u201cAs someone who has been in business for almost 25 years I have never seen anything like it,\u201d says Frith.</p> <p>The freehold of Warner Court is owned by Fairhold but run by Estates and Management, who appointed FirstPort as managing agents.</p> <p>FirstPort, a 2014 rebranding of a number of property management companies such as Peverel, OM and Solitaire, has a chequered history. In 2011, Guardian Money highlighted <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2011/feb/12/peverel-property-management-tenant-rebellion\">widespread allegations of excessive fees and poor service at Peverel</a>.</p> <p>We also featured <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2013/dec/14/cirrus-ripping-off-elderly\">Cirrus Communications Systems, a subsidiary of Peverel</a>, which colluded with other UK firms between 2005 and 2009 to rig so-called competitive quotes, and then obtain the business at an inflated price. Residents at some retirement homes, many in their 90s, subsequently did not know they could have paid far less for services such as door entry systems.</p> <p>At Warner Court, Frith alleges a catalogue of failings by the management company. Many relate to alleged failure to comply with the Landlord &amp; Tenant Act 1985 (as amended by the Commonhold and Leasehold Reform Act 2002). Section 20 of the act sets out a consultation procedure that freeholders, or their agents, need to follow when carrying out qualifying works to a building where each unit would be billed \u00a3250 or more.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2645a4e02be534c9a94414fa148c317c84991d20\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2645a4e02be534c9a94414fa148c317c84991d20/0_0_3264_2448/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Warner Court residents have their cake after taking control of their block.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Warner Court residents have their cake after taking control of their block.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Warner Court Residents</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The consultation process allows leaseholders to check out recommended contractors and their tenders, or suggest alternative contractors to quote for the work. Frith alleges FirstPort broke section 20 several times by spending five-figure sums without prior consultation. The amounts included \u00a318,000 spent on decorating in 2008, \u00a317,000 on lounge furniture in 2014, and more than \u00a310,000 on plumbing in the same year.</p> <p>FirstPort accepted there had been \u201ca historical issue\u201d with its processes at Warner Court, meaning the section 20 consultation process was \u201cnot always followed\u201d. \u201cWe have rectified this by investing in a major works team who have the single focus on ensuring the administration of the section 20 consultation process runs smoothly and effectively for residents,\u201d it said.</p> <p>In particular, it admits the \u00a317,000 on furniture did not follow the rules. \u201cAs soon as we were made aware of this error we refunded residents the full amount owing to them,\u201d it said.</p> <p>But Frith says she recalls the incident differently: \u201cNo consultation was made, so I fought and managed to get back the difference because FirstPort knew it had broken the law,\u201d she says.</p> <p>What happened to the old furniture is a mystery. FirstPort said it was donated to charity Sue Ryder, but Frith says she can find no evidence of this. \u201cI contacted the charity, which stated that it has not received the furniture and does not have the capacity to collect or store the amount involved.\u201d</p> <p>Frith also alleges that when a flood occurred in February 2014 a bill for more than \u00a38,000 was paid from the block\u2019s contingency fund, despite the fact that insurance should have paid for the bulk of the repairs.</p> <p>Frith has numerous other examples of what she says was frivolous spending of leaseholders\u2019 money. In six of the past eight years FirstPort said roof work was required. On one occasion it used a contractor based near Exeter, about 145 miles away, despite there being plenty of local roofing firms. The roofers\u2019 invoice, which Money has seen, included travel expenses and accommodation.</p> <p>FirstPort denies that leaseholders were charged for travel expenses, and says it opted for the cheaper of two quotes. \u201cOur national reach means we can realise cost benefits from working with national contractors, who are well-versed to working across the country and provide competitive quotes regardless of location,\u201d it said in a statement.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/mar/09/service-charges-soar-to-average-2777-per-year-for-new-build-flats\">Property service charges soar to average \u00a32,777 per year for new-builds</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But after years of gripes, the residents of Warner Court decided enough was enough. The Commonhold and Leasehold Reform Act 2002 provides a right for leaseholders to acquire the landlord\u2019s management functions (if not the freehold itself) by transfering them to an RTM company set up by them .</p> <p>This is, in theory, relatively simple. The right is exercised by the service of a formal notice on the landlord. After a set period of time the management transfers to the RTM company. At least half the flats need to join the RTM company, which will then appoint directors and other officers, usually all residents. By default, the freeholder is also entitled to membership of the company. Once in control of the building the RTM company needs to stick to all the terms in the lease concerning maintenance and repairs but, crucially, the directors can make decisions about which contractors to use and how much to spend.</p> <p>Gaining the RTM has knocked about a third off the management fee for Warner Court residents. FirstPort budgeted \u00a363,950 for service charges for the block in 2016, but the RTM company\u2019s revised budget puts this at \u00a341,699.</p> <p>FirstPort was not keen to let the site go to another management firm, with one of its managers telling elderly residents not to join the RTM. It took the residents eight months to gain the RTM, costing \u00a39,000. The bulk of the bill was for legal costs \u2013 residents must pay the freeholder\u2019s costs as well as their own, and there\u2019s no legal obligation for the freeholder to use a competitively priced solicitor.</p> <p>\u201cI can see how a lot of people are put off by this process \u2013 after a couple of months of legal battling I renamed it \u2018Fight to Manage\u2019 because that is exactly what it is,\u201d Frith says.</p> <h2>Who are FirstPort?</h2> <p>FirstPort is the current name for property group Peverel, which was rebranded in 2014.</p> <p>It manages around 180,000 properties across the UK, including about 60,000 retirement homes.</p> <p>FirstPort is part of Knight Square, which is jointly owned by the private equity companies Chamonix and Electra.</p> <p>Formerly Peverel, FirstPort was renamed in 2014. Peverel went into administration in 2011 when a bank loan was called in shortly after its owner Vincent Tchenguiz and his brother Robert were arrested by the Serious Fraud Office.</p> <p>However, the investigation was subsequently dropped and the brothers received millions of pounds in damages and an apology. Peverel was rescued by Chamonix and Electra<strong tabindex=\"-1\"> </strong>the following year in a \u00a362m deal.</p> <p>However, Peverel didn\u2019t sever ties with Tchenguiz completely. The Tchenguiz Family Trust, based in the British Virgin Islands, still ultimately owns about 65% of the freehold sites that are now under the management of FirstPort.</p> <p>Since 2010 retirement developments built by builder McCarthy &amp; Stone have been under the management of an in-house company.</p> <p>Its developments that were completed before that date, are managed by third-party companies, led by FirstPort.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 21 October 2016 to make clear that there is now no ownership interest in FirstPort by Vincent Tchenguiz or any of his companies.</p>",
  "<p>I think it is fair to say that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/paralympics\">Paralympics</a> have changed perceptions for the better in linking disability and sport. We have become used to watching elite athletes win medals and represent their countries in front of large crowds, and they just happen to use wheelchairs or prosthetic limbs, or be of short stature, or have hearing and visual impairments.</p> <p>But what happens when we change \u201csport\u201d to \u201csex\u201d? Does awareness and education exist in the same way?</p> <p>Inclusive and accessible sex education certainly did not exist when I was at school \u2013 apart from, perhaps, putting a condom on a banana. We are aware that disabled women, in particular, are almost three times as likely to be sexually abused than their non-disabled peers and yet those of us with disabilities are still entering lessons and workshops that are not designed for us. There are few, if any, subtitled and audio-described videos, information is usually not easy to read or understand, and the bodies in these videos and photos rarely, if ever, reflect disability of any kind, further alienating those of us classed as less than normal, and often less than attractive.</p> <p>My twin sister and I were born 10 weeks early with cerebral palsy and I became a wheelchair-user at the age of nine after corrective surgery on my legs.</p> <p>Like many of my friends, I have been in situations where I felt vulnerable sexually, but one in particular was exacerbated by my disability. I am well able to stand up for myself, but I was in a taxi, with my wheelchair in the boot, and the taxi driver was totally inappropriate and very suggestive. Knowing that my disability hindered me in dealing with his approaches was horrible. I decided to keep talking politely to him in the hope that I could distract him through small talk, which I did, until he dropped me off.</p> <p>I reported him, but it highlighted the difficult situations you can find yourself in sexually if you have a disability.</p> <p>Children and teenagers are constantly told to respect themselves and others, but if you are disabled, it is likely that many of the adults in your life might never consider you as a sexual being, meaning that the usual safety advice and strategies are rarely discussed. You are doubly vulnerable if you can\u2019t physically remove yourself easily from an awkward situation.</p> <p>I have been fortunate enough to have great sex and talk about it, but it wasn\u2019t easy for me. Before losing my virginity pretty late, when I was 19, my main concern wasn\u2019t the act itself, but the positions that would be possible without causing a great amount of pain. I also worried that the passion would totally disappear after a bit of inevitable planning.</p> <p>There were very few helpful answers on the internet, so that left one avenue: laughing and crying with my auntie and sister on a Sunday afternoon as we went through possible positions together \u2026 no doubt a story that will surface should I ever get married.</p> <p>Although it was a giggle and it helped a lot \u2013 thanks, guys \u2013 it is also tragic that I had to get myself in such a panic over something that is supposed to be sexy and fun because I simply didn\u2019t know where, or who else, to turn to.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Some people think that disability isn\u2019t sexy or, worse, having sex with someone who has a disability is seen as wrong</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Most people, disabled or not, go through a transition stage in which they are suddenly aware of others\u2019 attraction to them and their desire to be attractive in return. For me, this happened quite late and I tended to leave getting the guys to my sister, who was, I have to say, very successful at it (she is about to get married). Although I\u2019m over the moon for her now, I can see that I was pretty jealous of her victories with boys at the time.</p> <p>As I have got older, learned that necessary patience and had great sexual experiences, I have also grown in confidence, although I still have some way to go until I am as self-assured as I would like to be when it comes to romance and intimacy.</p> <p>Some people still think that disability isn\u2019t sexy or, worse, having sex with someone who has a disability is seen as wrong. There is also still a sense that if you have a disability, you are ill or frail, neither of which fit into the traditional idea of what we consider sexually attractive in our society.</p> <p>But change is coming and I am proud to be a part of that.</p> <p>My sexual experiences have resulted in an awareness of myself as a woman that no one can take away \u2013 and that is a great place to be, disability or not. But it is important to remember that those experiences don\u2019t come easily for young disabled people. For so many years, I have had more important things than being sexy to concentrate on. Other teenagers tend not to have to think twice about whether they are able to go on school trips, or prove they can go to university \u2013 physically travel there, rather than just reach the required academic standards, find accessible accommodation and work out travel arrangements.</p> <p>My confidence has been boosted enormously by taking control of my life, and this has helped me in my job as a travel writer. When I volunteered at London 2012, I sat next to Sebastian Coe at a press conference and asked him for 15 minutes of his time and all the contacts he could give me. He, in turn, mentioned me in his speech at the closing ceremony for saying that the Paralympic Games had \u201clifted the cloud of limitation\u201d for those with disabilities.</p> <p>I went on to do a two-year consultancy with MetroRio on accessible underground travel and wrote an accessible-travel guide to Rio de Janeiro with Lonely Planet in preparation for the 2016 Olympic and Paralympic Games. I am the founder and one of the directors of <a href=\"http://mypurplecompass.co.uk/\">My Purple Compass</a>, a company that encourages people with disabilities to travel far and wide, journeying out of their comfort zones.</p> <p>I also work with <a href=\"http://enhancetheuk.org/enhance/\">Enhance the UK</a>, which, through <a href=\"http://enhancetheuk.org/enhance/the-love-lounge/\">the Love Lounge</a>, is providing the sort of information I would have loved as a teenager. Change is slow, but it is happening, and we are able to help others to discuss important issues, such as the positions and pain worry I had years ago, through to whether disclosing a disability on an online dating site is a good idea.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/jul/14/lets-take-the-initiative-to-start-a-sexual-revolution-for-people-with-disabilities\">Let's take the initiative to start a sexual revolution for people with disabilities</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Sex education for disabled children and teenagers must be taught in schools as a matter of course, and parents and other family members can play a big part by making it as important for disabled people as for everyone else. More sexually active disabled people in popular culture would also help to change all those perceptions of disabled people, and illustrate that we enjoy sex as much as anyone.</p> <p>Although being a disabled woman is currently what my work is based on, I\u2019m much more than a girl in a wheelchair. I have the same tatts, tinted hair and love of fashion as many women my age, and I hope that others see that as well as the wheelchair.

I&#xa0;hate&#xa0;myself for it, but I have been unable to stop the emotions crashing inside me. Before you turned up on the&#xa0;scene, I was happy enough in my own skin and thought I was an easygoing, quiet person who mixed well with people.</p> <p>I&#xa0;didn\u2019t go for glamour, but went more for the&#xa0;rural, practical look that was comfy. When you waltzed into our&#xa0;lives, you were everything I wasn\u2019t, and people\u2019s sly comments soon let me&#xa0;know it and it tore me apart.</p> <p>You were a decade younger than me, you were vibrant and had a poise and sophistication I could never possess.

I&#xa0;am the quiet one and suddenly I&#xa0;was&#xa0;stifled, so pale and insignificant next to you.</p> <p>The more I began to feel insecure and voiceless, the more my insecurities&#xa0;took over. I dreaded every&#xa0;family occasion because you&#xa0;would be there, the shining star&#xa0;once again.

  "<p>One hundred and fifty years ago, my great-great-great-grandfather, <a href=\"http://www.winchesterguns.com/news/articles/150-years-of-winchester.html\">Oliver Winchester,</a> founded the Winchester Repeating Arms Company in New Haven, Connecticut. His pride and joy was the revolutionary Winchester repeating rifle, one of the first guns to fire rounds repeatedly, taking away the cumbersome need to stop and reload. The Winchester became an icon of the American frontier \u2013 used by cowboys, Native Americans, outlaws, sheriffs and even President Theodore Roosevelt. As the settlers went steadily westwards after the civil war, the Winchester was their weapon of choice \u2013 it became known as the Gun that Won the West, celebrated in celluloid numerous times by a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uu0h3GRBQ-U\">gun-toting John Wayne</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D5_0cMzFVw\">youthful Jimmy Stewart</a>.</p> <p>Used by the Turks in their 19th-century battles against the Russians, and by the Mexicans in their uprising against the French-backed emperor, the Winchester became known around the world. The company\u2019s officials were always wary of having a history of their beloved rifles written \u2013 we don\u2019t want dead buffalo and Indians on every page, observed my great-great-uncle Ed Pugsley, the chief engineer.</p> <p>My introduction to the Winchester came on a hot August afternoon in 1987, more than a century after Oliver Winchester had started manufacturing his rifles. Visiting my American relatives in Connecticut, we fired tennis balls from an adapted elephant gun into the sparkling waters of the Long Island Sound, just for the fun of it. My great-aunts, legend has it, would fire the tennis-balls at intruders who ventured too close to their family compound.</p> <p>We were having a high old time at the family compound in Branford, Connecticut, which had been built by Oliver\u2019s daughter Jennie and her husband, Thomas Gray Bennett. As a distant family member from London, I had a dim idea of what the Winchester repeating rifle was, having watched a healthy dose of westerns on TV during my early 70s childhood. And as a former air cadet in east London, I learned to fire a .22 rifle and a .303 \u2013 but always on a shooting range, in a highly restricted environment. And here were my relatives merrily shooting tennis balls into the blue yonder, with guns inside their summer houses \u2013 it was an introduction to the gun culture of America, so very different from that back home in Britain.</p> <p>My grandmother Molly, who inherited a not-inconsiderable sum of money as the great-granddaughter of Oliver, married an Englishman and left her family in New England for Cambridge, England. She was ambivalent about the legacy of the Winchester, and would occasionally grunt disapprovingly about gun money, shaking her head. As a child, she took me to CND rallies in Cambridge, and we watched deeply alarming videos about Hiroshima. A strange juxtaposition, the gun heiress turned fervent supporter of nuclear disarmament.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"34cd9f3515177bad84afe0db1047cd4feae96ce9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/34cd9f3515177bad84afe0db1047cd4feae96ce9/768_141_2127_2741/776.jpg\" alt=\"Two Native Americans carrying Winchester rifles, 1885.\" width=\"776\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Two Native Americans carrying Winchester rifles, 1885.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: CS Fly/Courtesy of Laura Trevelyan</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>That visit to my American clan stayed with me as I went off to university. I began to read all I could about Oliver Winchester and his rifles. He was born a penniless farm boy, trained as a carpenter building flying buttresses in churches, successfully patented a bestselling shirt collar, and then decided to invest his considerable cash in guns just as the US civil war was looming. When my husband and I moved with our sons across the Atlantic in 2004, my interest in all matters Winchester increased. We bought the caretaker\u2019s cottage on the family\u2019s summer estate of Johnson\u2019s Point in Connecticut, and the idea of writing a book about these mysterious descendants of yesteryear evolved.</p> <p>As I was learning about my Winchester heritage, I was reporting for the BBC on the phenomenon of mass shootings in America. In the aftermath of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/dec/16/sandy-hook-classroom-massacre\">Sandy Hook elementary school massacre</a> in 2012, when a gunman killed 20 young children, six adults, his mother and himself, I arrived to witness a scene of unbearable agony. In this picture-perfect Connecticut town, not far from where Winchester built his repeating rifles, Christmas trees had been put up in memory of every dead child. I stood outside the temporary mortuary where the bodies of the murdered six- and seven-year-olds lay, and wept, imagining how I would feel if my own six-year-old was inside.</p> <p>At school, my children learned what they called \u201chuddle drills\u201d \u2013 what to do if someone is having a really bad day, as my then seven-year-old son explained brightly. I told him reassuringly that I didn\u2019t feel that he would ever have to do a huddle drill for real. In the wake of Sandy Hook, Congress failed to pass even modest gun-control legislation, such as ensuring background checks on people who buy weapons at gun shows.</p> <p>As the descendant of a dynasty created by manufacturing weapons of war, writing a book has forced me to examine my own feelings on the topic. One of our relatives, Sarah Winchester, was supposedly so racked with guilt and haunted by the spirits of those killed by the Winchester that she started building a house in California because a medium advised her that endless building would appease the dead. Construction only stopped when she died. Thousands flock every year to the bizarre <a href=\"http://www.winchestermysteryhouse.com/\">Winchester Mystery House</a>, pulled in by the irresistible tale of guns and guilt. There is scant truth to the myth \u2013 but that\u2019s another story.</p> <p>I am fascinated by the Winchester legacy, but I don\u2019t feel responsible for or guilty about the past. I see our family as a thread in the tapestry of America\u2019s history. There is no airbrushing over the brutality of the settling of America\u2019s west, in which guns were central. The Winchester was deployed to kill Native Americans defending their historic lands \u2013 and yet they also used the rifle with devastating effect, most notably at General Custer\u2019s last stand. African Americans also embraced the Winchester as a defensive weapon in the bloody period after the civil war, in which lynching was common. \u201cA Winchester rifle should have a place of honour in every black home,\u201d as the civil rights crusader Ida B Wells wrote in 1892. And so the Winchester was used for many different causes during a violent period.</p> <p>As a soon-to-be dual US and British citizen, it is hard not to be struck by the starkly different approaches to gun control. When I was growing up in Britain, strict gun laws were passed in the aftermath of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2012/aug/20/archive-1987-hungerford-massacre-michael-ryan\">Hungerford massacre in 1987</a> and then additional legislation was passed after the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2013/mar/14/dunblane-massacre-scotland-killing\">Dunblane school killings</a>. In the US, where the second amendment provides a constitutional right to keep and bear arms, the debate is very different. Although opinion polls suggest the public supports controls on the sale of assault weapons and background checks for everyone who buys a gun, the National Rifle Association has so far lobbied successfully against these measures.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ad57078c08d9b254474d66f16c42f4bde14d86ec\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ad57078c08d9b254474d66f16c42f4bde14d86ec/0_0_2693_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Laura Trevelyan\u2019s great-great-grandfather, Thomas Gray Bennett, left, with his grandson, baby Thomas Gray Bennett, and his son Winchester Bennett, c1900.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"780\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Laura Trevelyan\u2019s great-great-grandfather, Thomas Gray Bennett, left, with his grandson, baby Thomas Gray Bennett, and his son Winchester Bennett, c1900.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Laura Trevelyan</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Hillary Clinton is running in favour of what she calls commonsense gun control, while Donald Trump is staunchly against her proposals. Why such different approaches in two countries sharing a common language and heritage? Guns were embedded in the culture of America at the time of its violent revolutionary war against England, and used to expand the territory of the new nation.</p> <p>When the question of gun control in the US came up in the 1970s, the surviving Winchester relatives were staunchly opposed. But then they had never been fans of Uncle Sam having a say in their business. In the 1890s, when men at the Winchester factory were regularly blown up as they mixed the explosive primer used in the ammunition, my great-great-grandfather, Thomas Gray Bennett, perfected a system where the men mixed the primer using mirrors to keep themselves at a safe distance. He was most pleased to have kept meddling factory inspectors at bay through his own ingenuity.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/jul/25/kids-guns-and-the-american-way\">Kids, guns and the American way</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In fact, it was heavy-handed government-administered contracts that led to the end of the Winchester Repeating Arms Company as a family concern. When the first world war loomed into view, my great-grandfather, Winchester Bennett, was at the company helm. A highly strung man, he had suffered from nervous anxiety for much of his adult life and was nursed throughout by his devoted wife, Susan. Winchester, named after the gun, was not equipped to deal with the rigours of wartime production and had to leave the company just as the factory was gearing up to produce millions of rounds of ammunition and tens of thousands of rifles for the allied wartime effort. Bennett was later treated for addiction at a Connecticut facility specialising in patients with psychiatric disorders.</p> <p>His father, Thomas Gray Bennett, though he was nearly 80, came back on to the company board at this time of personal and professional crisis. Thomas Bennett never approved of doing business with the US government, which insisted on fixed-price contracts. As the costs of labour and materials skyrocketed because of wartime demand, Winchester made less and less money. By the time the war ended, the company was millions of dollars in debt. A wild plan to diversify into selling products \u201cas good as the gun\u201d followed, and the company used the excess factory space left over from the war to manufacture ice-skates, penknives, fishing rods, washing machines, cutlery and all manner of household items. The scheme was a monumental failure and the Winchester Repeating Arms Company went into receivership in 1931.</p> <p>A special summer home is the legacy of the company for our generation. As I rake the beach for oyster shells, if I narrow my eyes I can conjure up the image of a cowboy out west galloping on his horse, his trusty Winchester at his side. The great-aunts have passed on now, but I can still hear the echo of their laughter as they fire the tennis-ball gun out into Long Island Sound.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Winchester: Legend of the West by Laura Trevelyan is published by IB Tauris, \u00a320.

  "<p>It was a breaking story on the evening news. The Super Mario Brothers Bandit \u2013 so-called because the bushy fake moustache and cap he wore to rob banks resembled the Nintendo character \u2013 had been arrested. \u201cGame over,\u201d said the newsreader. And from her seat on the sofa, 13-year-old Molly Brodak saw her father\u2019s sad-looking face float into view in the corner of the screen.</p> <p>Few people ever think about a criminal as some child\u2019s dad. The default is simple: bank robber equals bad person. But the truth is more complex, says Molly, now 36, and it was one of those times when a kid knew the truth better than the adults around her. \u201cMy dad wasn\u2019t all bad. He loved us; he cared for us. He wasn\u2019t just a bad person.\u201d</p> <p>At 13, Molly had to accept that the person she most looked up to was, in the eyes of the world, a wicked and dangerous character who had to be locked away from other people. Like most children whose parents end up in jail, Molly had been economically, socially and emotionally deprived well before her father, Joe, was finally caught for a series of bank raids, in which he would simply saunter into a bank, pass the teller a note saying, \u201cI have a gun\u201d, and demand cash.</p> <p>At school, other kids gave her strange looks: they knew, and she knew they knew. When Joe Brodak was sentenced to 10 years in prison, Molly\u2019s future seemed clear. The odds were stacked against her: the chances were that she would fail in education, and might even end up in trouble with the law herself. Law-breaking, like so much else, often repeats from generation to generation.</p> <p>But that\u2019s not what happened. Instead, Molly withdrew. \u201cI didn\u2019t have big bunches of friends or do lots of sports. I spent a lot of time in the library. I buried myself in my books.\u201d</p> <p>She did well at school. In fact, she shone. When she got a college place, it seemed she had avoided the pitfalls of being a criminal\u2019s child, and a successful future was assured. But Molly began to shoplift. She was a hard-up student, her dad was in prison and her mum didn\u2019t have much money. She was good at shoplifting and it meant, just as it had for Joe, that she was able to cope with tough financial times. We learn behaviour from our parents: if this is how her dad got out of monetary holes, this was how Molly did it, too. But when she had been shoplifting for a while, the thought hit her: there would come a day when she would be caught, just as her father had been.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"3cf904bc824d4bec2486bd64e73ae6288666592b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3cf904bc824d4bec2486bd64e73ae6288666592b/393_187_4289_2575/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Molly Brodak\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Molly Brodak is a poet and professor of English at Kennesaw University in Georgia</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: courtesy Icon Books</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI knew it would be only a matter of time until I made a mistake or got sloppy with my methods and found myself with a criminal record,\u201d she says in her memoir, which is published this week. \u201cI resolved to quit while I was ahead.\u201d Looking back, she can see exactly why it all happened. \u201cIt was a way of acting through \u2013 then resolving \u2013 the pattern of theft that destroyed my family.\u201d</p> <p>Today, Molly is a poet and professor of English at Kennesaw University in the US state of Georgia. Her memoir is stark and moving: she hones in on dark moments in her childhood, such as when her dad told her and her sister that he was divorcing their mum (for a second time) because she had cheated on him. Did they know what that meant, he asked? \u201cHe spoke slowly and loudly, as if he wanted to hurt us with the words: \u2018It means she let another man stick his penis inside of her.\u2019 I slumped as if cowering, went hot with tears. I felt sick from these people, how they acted and talked, the things they wanted, their stupid bitterness and coarse desires, how we had to be carried around recklessly by them.\u201d</p> <p>Molly\u2019s memoir is a missive from a childhood in crisis. She grew up in Michigan, in a series of cheap apartments. \u201cMy memories are of dirty carpets and dingy stairwells,\u201d she says. \u201cWe were a working-class family, and Dad was a gambler, so sometimes there was money, and sometimes we were hungry.\u201d</p> <p>Her mum was viewed as a homebreaker because her dad had been married when they met and she became pregnant with Molly\u2019s older sister; her dad denied he was married time and again, until Molly\u2019s mum discovered the truth. The family set-up, Molly says, was built on deceit: her dad was secretive, mysterious, slippery, impossible to pin down. \u201cHe never told the truth and he made you feel like you were crazy when you asked him what was going on. Then there was his money. One day his car would be repossessed, another day he\u2019d come home with a gold watch. One day he had no money to pay the bills, another day he was Mr Big.\u201d</p> <p>The day Molly and her mum found out that he had been arrested for robbing a bank, she realised something \u2013 and she could tell from her mum\u2019s face that she realised it too. Despite the shock, despite the shame, despite the horror of what had happened, there was another emotion: relief. \u201cIt was relief that, finally, he had been pinned down,\u201d she says. \u201cThis was something concrete. He was a bank robber.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/jan/03/our-familys-criminal-past-julie-shaw-crime-novels\">Our family\u2019s criminal past</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Joe Brodak served seven years of his 10-year sentence. He got out, went straight for a while, then robbed another bank at gunpoint and is currently 12 years into his sentence for that. Although the rest of the family are not in touch with him, Molly is. When a family member is in prison, she says, it is easy to have nothing to do with them. She doesn\u2019t blame her mother and sister for taking the path they have chosen, but feels that, for her, the only way was to find out everything she could about her father.</p> <p>For the memoir, she delved into Joe\u2019s deprivations and difficulties (he was born in Poland in a camp for those who had survived the concentration camps, and served in Vietnam), she examined her parents\u2019 early relationship, and she thought about his reasons for embarking on a life of crime (just as for her, it was an easy way to make money). As far as their future relationship is concerned, she rules nothing out, and nothing in.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Joe has told Molly that he is proud of all she has achieved, and how she did it against the odds. \u201cI\u2019m always hesitant to believe anything he says,\u201d is Molly\u2019s verdict on that.

  "<p>Large-scale batteries to store energy and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/apr/27/hand-over-control-of-my-fridge-to-an-energy-company-no-thanks-say-brits\">devices that switch themselves off</a> are likely to be key technologies for keeping the UK\u2019s lights on while shutting down old coal and nuclear plants, an influential committee of MPs has said.</p> <p>The threat of blackouts has receded for this winter after scares earlier in the year, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/14/winter-electricity-blackouts-risk-recedes-says-national-grid\">National Grid said on Friday</a>, citing a reprieve for Yorkshire\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/sep/02/eggborough-power-station-to-close\">Eggborough coal-fired power station</a>, as well as greater flexibility from companies with big energy requirements.</p> <p>But the respite will be brief unless further action is taken, warned parliament\u2019s energy and climate change select committee. The MPs recommend investment in two major areas: on the supply side, energy storage; and on the demand side, efficiency technologies that smooth out peaks in usage, for instance by switching devices off and on and running them at lower power at times.</p> <p>Angus MacNeil, chair of the committee, said: \u201cThe government must get a move on and encourage the energy market to embrace smart technological solutions like energy storage and demand-side response. There is an incredible opportunity for the UK to become a world leader in these disruptive technologies, yet our current energy security subsidies favour dirty diesel generation over smart new clean tech solutions.\u201d</p> <p>The committee also called for sweeping reforms to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/jul/23/concerns-uk-electricity-market-reforms\">government\u2019s regulation of the energy market, which include a \u201ccapacity market\u201d</a> for ensuring there is sufficient electricity supply and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/may/15/reform-electricity-market-unworkable\">contracts awarded to suppliers through an auction</a>. While these systems were supposed to reward renewable energy companies and reduce the carbon emitted by electricity generation, in practice <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/11/diesel-farms-built-subsidies-national-grid-auction\">some of the main beneficiaries have been generators using diesel oil</a>, which is one of the dirtiest forms of generation but very flexible.</p> <p>Redrawing these regulations could benefit cleaner generation such as wind farms and solar power, as well as newer technologies such as large-scale batteries and systems to manage energy, called demand-side response.</p> <p>John Sauven, executive director of Greenpeace UK, backed the call for reform: \u201cThis report from a cross-party group of MPs is an urgent wake-up call for Theresa May\u2019s government. It\u2019s embarrassing that Britain, one of the world\u2019s leading economies, has to hand out taxpayer-funded subsidies to clunking old coal plants and highly polluting diesel generators to keep the lights on. The right mix of renewable energy, battery storage and efficiency measures offers a much better alternative.\u201d<br></p> <p>The technology available to manage demand and increase efficiency is growing fast, according to Friends of the Earth, and the cost of it is also falling. But government support \u2013 such as reforms of the current regulations \u2013 would increase its uptake, with beneficial effects. </p> <p>Simon Bullock, campaigner at the charity, said: \u201c[These technologies] are a massive economic opportunity for the UK. They\u2019re essential to build the smart, flexible, clean electricity grid we need in the 2020s, and they reduce our reliance on fossil fuel plants for backup power, and can help lower people\u2019s bills.\u201d</p> <p>Companies involved in demand-side response technology say that, after decades of development, it is now at a stage where it can play a big role in energy efficiency, which will help to reduce demands on electricity supply. </p> <p>Patrick Liddy, director of EnerNOC, one of the companies developing such tools, said: \u201cDemand-side response technology is mature [and] provides many benefits for the UK, including engaging heavy energy users such as factories, commercial property and public sector estates in keeping the network balanced. Current UK energy policy was originally written with generation in mind, so it\u2019s only right that now we have the demand-side technology available, [the UK should] evolve our approach.\u201d</p> <p>The report, entitled The Energy Revolution and Future Challenges for UK Energy and Climate Policy, is the last from the <a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/energy-and-climate-change-committee/\">energy and climate change committee</a>. The latter will be dissolved and future reports on energy and climate change will come from the committee that reports on the new <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jul/15/decc-abolition-major-setback-for-uk-climate-change-efforts\">Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy</a> (BEIS). </p> <p>That will mean far fewer parliamentary reports on the UK\u2019s energy and climate change policies than in the past, as the new BEIS committee will have a far broader remit, covering all of the UK\u2019s industry, business and commerce. Past reports, from a cross-party committee of MPs that was until last year <a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/biographies/commons/mr-tim-yeo/136\">chaired by a Conservative former minister</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jun/17/national-grid-needs-overhaul-say-energy-committee-mps\">have often criticised government policy</a>.</p> <p>In the report, the MPs also warn that the risks of Brexit to the UK\u2019s energy supply must be taken into account as a high priority. They highlight, for instance, the risk that collective EU systems will be discarded - for instance, a collective agreement to help any nation at risk from a sudden shortage in gas supply, such as that which might be threatened from the Russian president, Vladimir Putin.<br></p> <p>A spokesperson for BEIS, responding to the committee\u2019s findings, said: \u201cThe capacity market ensures that our families have a secure energy supply at a fair price that they can rely on.</p> <p> \u201cWe are fully committed to a low carbon energy future and the potential benefits that new technologies such as storage could bring to this. However, for the capacity market to work effectively it relies on flexible technology that is ready to be deployed\u201d</p>",

  "<p>Ten seconds before my father\u2019s death, I have a premonition \u2013 that the breath he is taking will be his last. Of course, I\u2019ve had these premonitions before. As he breathes out, I watch and listen, and I hold my own breath, and wait for him to breathe in again. And every time I think he won\u2019t, but he does. It\u2019s getting harder, but he does, as he is doing now.</p> <p>That\u2019s the good part \u2013 the intake of air. Then comes the terrifying part, when the carbon dioxide comes back out. Then there\u2019s a gap, followed by another uphill climb, another attempt on the summit.</p> <p>I urge him on.</p> <p>Come on! You can do it! He is 86.</p> <p>We\u2019re in a ward, in a hospital, eight beds, eight very old men. It\u2019s 9.35pm. I\u2019m supposed to leave the ward in 25 minutes. But I can\u2019t imagine my father will be alive in 25 minutes. That would be a lease of life, a bonus. I want it, but I don\u2019t want it. I want to be with him when he dies. But I&#xa0;don\u2019t want to be with him when he dies. But, of course, I do. My brain is confused. I\u2019m entering a period of&#xa0;shock.</p> <p>We were never close, by the way. This, these last few days, is the closest we have been for years, maybe decades. Since the weekend in Montreal in 1979, I keep thinking, and then driving through Nova Scotia for, what, a week? Since then, I have seen him a lot, but we\u2019ve never talked&#xa0;much.</p> <p>He stopped talking three days ago. And then there were the days of the hand signals. I would talk and he would move his hands in response. Now I just talk. I am pretty sure he can hear me, that it matters, that I matter to him, a very self-centred thing to think. I am very self-centred.</p> <p>But these last few days have made me think how different things might have been. I might have been different, might have been closer to my father, if \u2026 Oh, come on! What about that last&#xa0;time I bumped into him in town? When we didn\u2019t go to a cafe, didn\u2019t have a cup&#xa0;of coffee? Why did he not want to, I keep thinking? But of course he had his reasons, must have had his reasons. He said he wanted to do this and that on his own, had made a plan, wanted to stick to the plan.</p> <p>Well, fine.</p> <p>Not many more chances, I thought even then. Not many more chances to sit down and have a chat. Father and son, chatting away. But he had his plan. So it never happened. And here we are. I\u2019m talking. But I don\u2019t know what to say. And he can\u2019t say anything. All he can do is breathe.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"164923fe1e9375e1a401c6d982eeb66eb07548bf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/164923fe1e9375e1a401c6d982eeb66eb07548bf/342_466_3291_1975/1000.jpg\" alt=\"William Leith with his father, George, and brother, Alex, in 1965.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">William Leith with his father, George, and brother, Alex, in 1965.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Frantzesco Kangaris for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>So really this idea, the idea that things might have been different, is probably just a deathbed fantasy. We were never close. He was always disappearing, my father, always living in different countries, and visiting yet more countries. Superficially, it seemed to make sense \u2013 he was a professor or a visiting professor here or there, Germany or Holland, say, and he worked for Unesco in Geneva. Hence the travel \u2013 to Africa, to the Middle East, often to dictatorships or communist countries. As a teenager, I&#xa0;met him in Swiss and German hotels. Twice he moved to Canada.</p> <p>I liked him.</p> <p>He moved back to England after I left home. Soon after that, something odd happened. One day, I found him in his room, his study I suppose, and he was looking at all these dictionaries \u2013 Dutch, German, Swedish \u2013 and taking notes. It was his hobby, his passion in life, he said. Tracking words across different languages. And this took my breath away. Because it was my hobby, too. As a student, I would get stoned and read dictionaries for hours. \u200bThat thing of being slumped, surrounded by&#xa0;dictionaries. Hey, I said to my father, I do the exact same thing. After that, we would buy each other books on linguistics.</p> <p>The last book I bought him was <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/through-the-language-glass.html\" title=\"\">Guy Deutscher\u2019s Through the Language Glass</a>. Shortly afterwards, he cut his leg and it wouldn\u2019t heal. And now this. It\u2019s all happened so fast. A cut that won\u2019t heal; a collapse, a couple of days in hospital, a course of powerful antibiotics. He was supposed to be in hospital for one night. Then two.</p> <p>But now he can barely suck air into his lungs. I\u2019m watching his face, his chest. He\u2019s going to try to take another breath. He\u2019s like a weightlifter.</p> <p>Come on! Come on!</p> <p>My mother and brother have left the hospital for the day. Now it\u2019s just me and my father. We have been \u2013 I have been \u2013 talking about various things. His love of languages, how he inspired me, which I suppose he must have done. I&#xa0;remember when he moved to Utrecht for a while and could pronounce Dutch words. I was maybe 12. He had been in Germany before that and told me how Dutch was close to German and also Flemish. I have been saying, over and over, what an inspiration he has been to me, how much I loved him, dropping in memories here and there, all in the tones of a talkshow host.</p> <p>There is a barrier between my performance, on the one hand, and my feelings. My feelings, unexplored, are on the other side of the barrier.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"560723ec7d2d55bb603549703c096090fbf9302e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/560723ec7d2d55bb603549703c096090fbf9302e/145_264_2177_2203/988.jpg\" alt=\"William Leith\u2019s father, George, in 1959.\" width=\"988\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">William Leith\u2019s father, George, in 1959.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Frantzesco Kangaris for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He was always very tolerant. I would be drunk or stoned, and he never seemed to mind. Once he made me a&#xa0;drink and I actually bit into the glass, had glass and blood in my mouth, and he said, \u201cYou OK?\u201d</p> <p>And I said, \u201cYes, I just bit the glass, but I&#xa0;think I\u2019m OK.\u201d And that was that. I spat the bits of glass out of my mouth and then we watched a late-night film.</p> <p>The deal in this hospital is that every so often I ask my father if he wants morphine, and if he does, he taps his chest. We have a system. If he does want morphine, I go to find a nurse, and there is a procedure to be followed \u2013 signatures, clipboards, a five-minute wait. Then he gets a morphine injection. Then he is drowsy for a bit, and then he perks up.</p> <p>This time, though, he has not perked up quite as much. He breathes in, and out. I look at him. He begins to breathe in. That\u2019s when I get my premonition.</p> <p>And then something strange happens. I have an urge to stand up, to walk away from my father\u2019s bedside. Which I do. Driven by something \u2013 fear, an acute stab of self-centredness perhaps, I stand up and take two paces, and then look back over my shoulder. I\u2019m at the corner of his bed. I tell myself I\u2019m looking for the nurse, or the&#xa0;doctor, or anyway that I\u2019m looking for something.</p> <p>And now he starts to breathe out. I turn now, and watch him. I\u2019m no longer running away. I\u2019m at his bedside, I will tell myself. I watch his face as the air leaves his lungs. Such a weight of air! I know he cannot pick this weight up again, know there is no way. His face is still. Eyes closed. He is still alive, probably, but not breathing. And now maybe he is not still alive.</p> <p>Or, I\u2019m thinking, maybe he is. Because what do I know?</p> <p>I walk across the floor of the ward to find a nurse. Busy, she turns around. I find myself unable to tell her what I have just seen. So I tell her something else. I say I think my father looks uncomfortable. I say I think he looks like he may be in trouble. I\u2019m sorry to bother her, I say, I know she\u2019s busy, but&#xa0;anyway.</p> <p>She looks at me. She will check. I&#xa0;wait in the corridor, in the reception area outside the ward. It\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve been outside the ward for a while. I smile at people. The next part is odd. A nurse I\u2019ve never met walks towards me. She is looking at me carefully. She tells me that my father has died.</p> <p>I say: \u201cYes, yes \u2013 I\u200b think you\u2019re right.\u201d</p> <p>Now I want to go and check. My thinking is that my father has probably died, has almost certainly died, but it\u2019s been so sudden, all of this, and he was definitely alive less than five minutes ago. There are still things I want to say! What if, I\u2019m thinking, what if he is not quite dead? Do these nurses really know for sure? Look how busy they are, I\u2019m thinking.</p> <p>They have drawn the curtains around his bed.</p> <p>I say, \u201cLook, do you mind if I just \u2026\u201d I don\u2019t say the word \u201ccheck\u201d.</p> <p>The nurse says, \u201cOf course.\u201d</p> <p>I part the curtains. My father looks sort of OK. I place my fingertips on his forehead. His eyes are closed.</p> <p>\u201cAnyway,\u201d I say.</p> <p>And: \u201cI\u2019ve just been talking to the nurses.\u201d</p> <p>And: \u201cAnd they think \u2026\u201d</p> <p>And: \u201cBut I\u2019ll still chat to you. For a&#xa0;while.\u201d</p> <p>For the moment, everything feels OK. The curtains are closed. No need to rush.</p> <p>Father and son. Chatting away.</p>",
  "<p>A lemongrass bush isn\u2019t much to look at: an oversized tuft of grass with long waxy leaves shooting out and drooping down in every direction. But if I came across one in a field somewhere, I\u2019d be grinning my way back to the kitchen. That unruly mop of tropical green comes with white stalks and the brightest of flavours. It sits somewhere between mint and fresh air, citrus and sunlight. It\u2019s steeped in hot water for tea from Togo to Mexico; it loves coconut, chilli and ginger in all manner of curries, but is no stranger to sweet creams and bakes. It\u2019s the herb you simply don\u2019t get used to: the one that\u2019s impossible to substitute and will surprise you every time.

He wouldn\u2019t turn it off until 199 minutes later. By then Wright was dead. </p> <p>Tostee, having left the building via a basement carpark but still apparently unaware of her fate as police milled around the building, had called his father who urged him to contact a leading criminal lawyer. He had then eaten a pizza. </p> <p>The crown case is that Tostee, who had locked Wright out on the balcony after their night had deteriorated into verbal and physical altercations, had left Wright in such a state of fear and intimidation that she felt compelled to flee.</p> <p>When Wright\u2019s attempt to climb down from the balcony went horribly awry, Tostee was thus responsible for her death, the prosecution contends. </p> <p>The prosecutor, Glen Cash, told the court in his opening address that at the very least Tostee meant to cause Wright grievous bodily harm, causing her to flee, resulting in her death. </p> <p>Cash said Tostee\u2019s recording captured a moment where sounds were consistent with him choking or strangling Wright. She pleaded to be allowed to go home before repeatedly screaming \u201cno\u201d as he shoved her on to the balcony and shut the door.</p> <p>Defence lawyers for Tostee, who has pleaded not guilty, deny any attempt by Tostee to strangle Wright. </p> <p>His barrister, Saul Holt, has told the court that Tostee used reasonable force to subdue Wright, who had grown \u201cincreasingly erratic\u201d while drinking heavily. She had taken to randomly, with no apparent provocation, hitting Tostee, threatening violence, throwing ornamental rocks \u2013 one of his interior decorations \u2013 at his head and hitting him with the clamp of his telescope. </p> <p>Holt argued that Tostee, after tackling Wright to the floor and forcing her on to the balcony, put them both in a position of safety by shutting the door.</p> <p>Tostee was entitled to lock the door on someone who was violent and disorderly, Holt submitted.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"c5084e831529617e655dee1ace0311af293f0984\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c5084e831529617e655dee1ace0311af293f0984/0_275_4121_2473/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gable Tostee arrives at the supreme court in Brisbane on Friday.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gable Tostee arrives at the supreme court in Brisbane on Friday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dan Peled/AAP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cShe is outside, he is inside and he has caused a locked door to be between the two of them,\u201d Holt told the court.</p> <p>\u201cWhat happened in this case is nothing like murder or manslaughter. It doesn\u2019t fit.\u201d</p> <p>Holt said the fact that the critical part of the evening was recorded on Tostee\u2019s phone meant there was \u201cvery little in dispute\u201d between the crown and the defence apart from the allegation about choking her, which was in \u201cabsolute dispute\u201d, and his culpability for her death.</p> <p>The audio recording, which was discovered by police on a Sony Xperia phone they found in Tostee\u2019s father\u2019s car, has been released by the court.</p> <p>It captures an early morning conversation awkwardly traversing topics from architecture to religion, as James Blunt and Kanye West play in the background.</p> <p>The talk is punctuated by Tostee\u2019s occasional cries of \u201cOw!\u201d as Wright punches him. He tells her to \u201cchill and have a drink\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cYou love beating me up like a Kiwi,\u201d Tostee says. Wright tells him she beats people up all the time.</p> <p>Tostee quips that he will end up looking \u201clike a piece of tenderised meat\u201d if she keeps hitting him. </p> <p>She asks him if he can tell her mother she\u2019s \u201cnot a loser\u201d. She talks about her dog that died, her belief in justice and the afterlife.</p> <p>Tostee says: \u201cWe die. That\u2019s it. Throw me off the balcony.\u201d He talks of \u201cthree things that are really good on this Earth: food, sleep and sex\u201d.</p> <p>He says there are \u201cno gods\u201d. She says: \u201cI\u2019ve seen stuff though.\u201d</p> <p>Wright tells him: \u201cI am going to go vampire on your arse.\u201d</p> <p>Tostee yells \u201cOw!\u201d again. He\u2019s still laughing. Wright\u2019s speech starts to lose its coherence. She shouts \u201cForrest Gump\u201d repeatedly, then \u201cI\u2019m a ninja \u2013 it\u2019s not funny.\u201d More cries of \u201cOw!\u201d from Tostee. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/oct/14/gable-tostee-caused-warriena-wrights-death-as-much-as-if-hed-pushed-her-court-told\">Gable Tostee 'caused Warriena Wright's death as much as if he'd pushed her', court told</a> </p> </aside>  <p>She goes to leave and he asks her if she wants him to walk her back to her apartment.
