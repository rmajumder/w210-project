  "<p>The death of young engineer Joe Cinque at the hands of his girlfriend, law student Anu Singh, was made famous by Helen Garner in her 2004 book Joe Cinque\u2019s Consolation. The circumstances of the crime, as related by Garner, still disturb: not only did Cinque languish, drugged and helpless, in the unstable Singh\u2019s control for an entire weekend, but many of the couple\u2019s friends were aware of Singh\u2019s fatal course, helping her purchase enough heroin to administer a fatal overdose, and attending a \u201cfarewell\u201d dinner party at the couple\u2019s home.<br></p> <p>Garner\u2019s book \u2013 which follows the trials of Singh and her accused accomplice, Madhavi Rao \u2013 is a concerted attempt to comprehend a killing that in its messiness and senselessness almost eludes understanding. As in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/mar/22/everywhere-i-look-by-helen-garner-review-elegant-reflections-on-life-writing-and-russell-crowe\">much of her nonfiction</a>, Garner adopts the methods of traditional reporting but animates it with her own distinct sensibility: it is equally an account of a crime as it is of her state of mind while reporting on one. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/oct/13/joe-cinques-consolation-review-a-cynical-exercise-but-not-without-consolations\">Joe Cinque's Consolation review \u2013 a cynical exercise, but not without consolations</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Now comes a film version: the debut feature from VCA graduate Sotiris Dounoukos which made two swiftly-<a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/movies/joe-cinques-consolation-film-of-helen-garners-book-a-hot-ticket-at-miff-2016-20160722-gqbcgk.html\">sold-out</a> appearances at this year\u2019s Melbourne International Film festival, and which opened nationally this week. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QhMCLNfRbzE\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/QhMCLNfRbzE?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>It\u2019s risky enough for a first-time filmmaker to adapt the work of one of Australia\u2019s great nonfiction writers. Add in the fact that Garner herself is an accomplished screenwriter, with a cinematic fluency to rival her mastery of fiction and journalism, and the outcome looks doomed to disappoint. And it does. </p> <h2><strong>Helen Garner: her own best translator to the screen</strong></h2> <p>Although billed as \u201cbased on\u201d Garner\u2019s book, the film is hardly a straightforward adaptation \u2013 nor could it be. Instead, Dounoukos and co-writer Matt Rubenstein attempt to reproduce the theory of the killing outlined by Garner, and to give the surrounding events dramatic shape. But their fidelity to Garner\u2019s perspective only reveals the ways in which the film fails to match her artfulness.<br></p> <p>Garner herself did not contribute to the adaptation but it\u2019s tempting to wish that she had. Her prior forays into filmmaking reveal that, unlike other writers who stumble when they shift mediums, she is her own best translator to the screen.</p> <p>Garner\u2019s films should be essential viewing for fans of Australian cinema but they are often overlooked in summations of her work: of her two screenplays, written for producer Jan Chapman, one served as a feature debut for New Zealand director Jane Campion, and the other as a mid-career highlight for Gillian Armstrong.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jul/26/the-last-days-of-chez-nous-rewatched-emotions-laid-bare-with-a-steady-sympathetic-hand\">The Last Days of Chez Nous rewatched \u2013 emotions laid bare with a steady, sympathetic hand</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Two Friends, made by Campion for the ABC in 1986, charts the end of a passionate teen friendship between two Sydney schoolgirls, cleverly told in reverse chronological order. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jul/26/the-last-days-of-chez-nous-rewatched-emotions-laid-bare-with-a-steady-sympathetic-hand\">1992\u2019s The Last Days of Chez Nous</a>, Armstrong\u2019s sixth feature, portrays a fraught love triangle between Beth \u2013 a strong-willed writer and mother \u2013 her French husband, J.P., and her knockabout younger sister Vicki. (The <a href=\"https://www.textpublishing.com.au/books/the-last-days-of-chez-nous-and-two-friends\">two scripts</a> were recently re-released by Text Publishing.)</p> <p>These screenplays have a shared vision of the vagaries of close female relationships. The teenagers in Two Friends \u2013 brunette, studious, not-quite-pubescent Louise; and blond, wild, sexually adventurous Kelly \u2013 are a yin and yang pair; they need each other, and yet are constantly in struggle. This dynamic is revisited in Chez Nous, where Beth and Vicki seem like siblings, mother and child, and rivals in love.<br></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iZFGRldbgI\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/3iZFGRldbgI?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Garner began reporting Joe Cinque\u2019s Consolation about five years after the release of Chez Nous, and the book is a continuation of the themes established in her films. In Consolation, she spends a deal of time attempting to understand the relationship between Singh and Rao, a compliant fellow student who hovered around Cinque\u2019s killing but was never found legally culpable. </p> <p>\u201cThe world is full of these female doublings,\u201d Garner writes, \u201c\u2026 symbiotic power arrangements that are called friendships because (outside of psychology, at least) we have no more accurate name for them.\u201d </p> <h2><strong>The beauty in the power struggle </strong></h2> <p>Though sometimes clearest in Garner\u2019s women, this view of human relationships as a series of power struggles holds true of all her subjects. Garner has a quantum physicist\u2019s view of social life: individuals are like particles in orbit, each exerting elemental forces on the other. One of her gifts as a writer is not only that she understands these dynamics so intimately but that she has a keen ear for the kind of sparkling, inimitable line that brings them into relief.<br></p> <p>An example from Chez Nous stands out. Elder sister Beth returns home from a road trip with her emotionally constipated father to find her leafy Glebe two-story in a state of disarray. Her husband J.P., who in her absence has struck up an affair with her sister Vicki and is summoning the courage to tell her, rather sheepishly hands her a can of beer, and Beth replies, with a hint of tartness, \u201cCan I have mine in a glass, please?\u201d </p> <p>It\u2019s a beautifully observed exchange. The audience understands at once that Beth feels standards have shifted in her absence, and she needs to reassert herself; that this sort of minor hostility is what has alienated J.P.; and that the mood of this temporary reunion will continue his shift of allegiance towards Vicki. Here in crystalline form is the kind of micro transferral of power that characterises Garner\u2019s treatment of relationships. </p> <p>But this dramatic insight \u2014 conversation as secret competition \u2014 is absent from the film version of Joe Cinque\u2019s Consolation. The script is expository where it should be elegant, and the dialogue is over-occupied with foreshadowing. </p> <p>In one especially blunt moment, Cinque, sitting around the fateful dinner table, beams at his guests and says, \u201cWe should do this more often\u201d \u2013 a grossly tragic line by any measure.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"61d64204c7b19789f6915868e7fbfff5483e0cf0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/61d64204c7b19789f6915868e7fbfff5483e0cf0/0_0_1650_1100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jerome Meyer as Joe Cinque and Maggie Naouri as Anu Singh in Joe Cinque\u2019s Consolation\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jerome Meyer as Joe Cinque and Maggie Naouri as Anu Singh in Joe Cinque\u2019s Consolation.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Consolation Films</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>That the dialogue is merely functional is not a cosmetic flaw. Garner is clear in her book that Singh\u2019s psychological cocktail \u2013 a possible personality disorder, coupled with the effects of drug use \u2013 made her an astonishingly wilful person, capable of convincing her father, a qualified doctor, to pay a deposit for liposuction even as he fretted about her dangerously thin appearance. </p> <p>It\u2019s difficult to imagine events unfolding as they did unless Singh was a fluent fabricator. This flood of talk \u2013 Singh suggesting she\u2019d kill herself, and that Cinque would go with her \u2013 is surely one of the keys to understanding the inaction of onlookers in confronting the danger she posed. The patter of a deluded person, capable of bamboozling others even in extreme circumstances, should be unmistakable, but the script for Consolation never manages to pitch Singh\u2019s characterisation to this level, which makes the filmmakers\u2019 version of events somehow ineffectual. The rhythms of human behaviour continually escape them, in both scripting and filming. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"58641d98404fe615ffa6148260be984e82abd940\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/58641d98404fe615ffa6148260be984e82abd940/0_0_592_299/500.jpg\" alt=\"Louise (Emma Coles) and Kelly (Kris Bidenko) in Two Friends\" width=\"500\" height=\"253\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Louise (Emma Coles) and Kelly (Kris Bidenko) in Two Friends.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In Two Friends, Campion and Garner stage their teenage drama as a flurry of everyday activity: characters are shopping, in transit, rummaging through closets, flicking through books, banging pianos, and dividing their attention. In Consolation, by contrast, the actors mostly stand \u2013 or more often sit \u2013 across from one another and deliver their lines, in a kind of facsimile of social interaction. </p> <p>Campion filmed Friends largely in long, static shots, in which her actors are continually moving around and out of frame, re-arranging the drama in front of the audience, and suggesting the life bustling around the edges of the screen. Dounoukos mostly shoots plain single shots, cutting around from face to face as his actors stay in place.</p> <p>This kind of static blocking, an inability to dynamically re-distribute actors within a screen space as the scene evolves, seems endemic in current Australian cinema (it\u2019s especially obvious in the work of VCA graduates: Ariel Kleiman\u2019s Partisan, Kasimir Burgess\u2019s Fell, and Justin Kurzel\u2019s Macbeth are just three other recent films hampered by poor staging). But it\u2019s particularly damaging to Consolation \u2013 reaching, as it does, for the atmosphere of real events, and the ring of truth.</p> <p>Dounoukos has said Singh was a friend-of-friends when they were fellow students at the Australian National University, so he seems well positioned to understand the flavour of the time. But although it scrupulously outlines the sequence of events behind Cinque\u2019s death, his film neglects to offer any texture; just as it takes the bones of Garner\u2019s book but not her wisdom. </p> <p>Joe Cinque\u2019s Consolation is a sober account of a real killing, but it lacks the spark of life. </p> <p><em>\u2022 Joe Cinque\u2019s Consolation is in cinemas now</em></p>",
  "<p>A Connecticut judge ruled on Friday that a group of families cannot hold gun companies liable for manufacturing, distributing or selling the AR-15-style rifle used to kill 20 children and six educators at Sandy Hook elementary school in 2012. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/20/sandy-hook-newtown-victims-trial-gun-manufacturers-adam-lanza\">Families of Newtown victims take on gun manufacturers in regulation case</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The gun companies are protected by a 2005 federal law designed to shield gun companies from liability when their products are misused by criminals, Connecticut superior court judge Barbara Bellis ruled, granting the gun companies\u2019 motion to strike the case. </p> <p>The Democratic presidential nominee, Hillary Clinton, has <a href=\"https://www.hillaryclinton.com/issues/gun-violence-prevention/\">pledged to repeal</a> this 2005 law if elected. Clinton\u2019s campaign has argued that the law \u201clets gun manufacturers and dealers act without consequence\u201d and that \u201cending the gun industry\u2019s legal immunity is an important step in tackling the epidemic of gun violence in this country\u201d.</p> <p>Gun rights advocates and gun companies say the law, which protects gun companies from liability \u201cfor the harm purely caused by criminal or unlawful use of firearm products\u201d, is common sense and shields the industry from politically motivated attacks. </p> <p>The Bushmaster XM15-E2S rifle used in the 2012 school shooting had been legally purchased by shooter Adam Lanza\u2019s mother. Lanza shot and killed her before driving to a local elementary school and murdering dozens of people. </p> <p>Clinton championed the Sandy Hook families involved in the lawsuit earlier this year as part of a series of attacks on her then opponent, Senator Bernie Sanders, who had voted in favor of the law. But her campaign said at the time that the 2005 Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act ensured that the families\u2019 chance of success in the case was \u201cslim\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWhile the families are obviously disappointed with the judge\u2019s decision, this is not the end of the fight. We will appeal this decision immediately and continue our work to help prevent the next Sandy Hook from happening,\u201d Josh Koskoff, one of the lawyers representing the Sandy Hook families, said in a statement on Friday. </p> <p>The defendants in the lawsuit include Bushmaster, the company that made the rifle; Camfour, a firearms distributor; and Riverview Gun Sales, the store where the gun was bought. According to court filings, Bushmaster merged into Remington Arms, which is also named in the lawsuit, in 2011. Both companies are part of the Freedom Group, which calls itself \u201cthe world\u2019s leading innovator, designer, manufacturer and marketer of firearms\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"688d34ef04ce5215f039134788ed60eef6b8f5de\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/688d34ef04ce5215f039134788ed60eef6b8f5de/0_100_5267_3162/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nicole Hockley, who lost her child, Dylan Hockley, 6, in the Sandy Hook school shooting in Connecticut, testifies on assault weapon legislation at the state senate.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nicole Hockley, who lost her child, Dylan Hockley, 6, in the Sandy Hook school shooting in Connecticut, testifies on assault weapon legislation at the state senate.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Seth Perlman/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act does not shield gun companies and dealers from all legal liability. They can still be sued over defective products, if they break the laws governing gun sales, and for \u201cnegligent entrustment\u201d, or selling the gun to someone who would obviously misuse it.</p> <p>To get around the shield law, lawyers for the Sandy Hook families had tried to argue that the manufacturer, distributor and dealer were all \u201cnegligent\u201d to market and sell powerful military-style weapons to civilians. The Connecticut judge rejected this argument.</p> <p>Agreeing with the Sandy Hook families\u2019 legal theory \u201cwould imply that the general public lacks the ordinary prudence to handle an object that Congress regards as appropriate for sale to the general public. This the court is unwilling to do,\u201d the judge ruled.</p> <p>Millions of Americans own AR-15s, which are one of the most popular styles of consumer rifles in America. FBI data suggests that only 3.55% of all gun murders are committed with any type of rifle. Most gun murders are committed with handguns.</p> <p>\u201cRemington is pleased with the court\u2019s decision today to strike the plaintiff\u2019s complaint,\u201d Remington lawyer James Vogts said.</p> <p>\u201cWe are pleased that the court has dismissed the case based on the PLCAA,\u201d Larry Keane, the general counsel to the National Shooting Sports Foundation, the firearm industry\u2019s trade group, said in a statement. \u201cThis law passed Congress over a dozen years ago by a broad bipartisan margin. It does not provide \u2018blanket immunity\u2019, as some have claimed. It merely bars lawsuits that seek to hold manufacturers and dealers responsible for the criminal misuse of legal, non-defective products that were lawfully sold.\u201d</p> <p>Among the family members that filed the lawsuit against the gun companies were Mark and Jackie Barden, who lost their seven-year-old son, Daniel; Nicole and Ian Hockley, who lost their six-year-old son, Dylan; and Bill Sherlach, who lost his wife, Mary, the school\u2019s psychologist.</p> <p>When Jackie Barden researched the gun used to kill her son, she was shocked at the military language and images Bushmaster used to market its weapons. \u201cConsider your man card reissued,\u201d one ad read, with a photo of a black rifle. \u201cForces of opposition, bow down,\u201d read another.</p> <p>\u201cHere you have this machine that was designed for use by the military being sold to civilians, to untrained civilians, with aggressive military battlefield language,\u201d her husband, Mark, told the Guardian in April. \u201cAnd guess what? History has shown that these people who are suicidal, disturbed individuals who are bent on killing large numbers of people \u2013 that\u2019s the weapon they choose.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/20/gun-control-orlando-attack-newtown-mass-shooting\">Can the US break its cycle of gun control failure?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Several parents involved with the lawsuit said they thought gun companies\u2019 marketing made the weapons more attractive to disturbed, violent young men like the one who killed their children.</p> <p>\u201cThere were a lot of guns that our shooter could have chosen from his arsenal and his mother\u2019s arsenal,\u201d Nicole Hockley said at a press conference in February. \u201cHe chose the AR-15. He was aware of how many shots it could get out, how lethal it was, how it would serve his objective of killing as many people as possible in as short a time as possible ... and the manufacturers need to be held responsible for that.\u201d</p> <p>Family members said they knew the lawsuit would be an uphill battle. They were told early on that \u201cgun manufacturers are untouchable\u201d, Jackie Barden said.</p> <p>Gun control groups criticized the decision and said PLCAA \u201cinfringed\u201d on victims\u2019 rights.</p> <p>\u201cClaiming to protect one right, the gun lobby has infringed on another: the right to have your day in court,\u201d Robyn Thomas, the executive director of the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, said in a statement. \u201cThe dismissal of the Newtown families\u2019 case doesn\u2019t mean their claims lack merit \u2013 it means that our system is rigged in favor of the gun industry and our leaders refuse to hold the manufacturers of deadly weapons of war accountable for the carnage they wreak in our communities, on our streets, and even in our first-grade classrooms.

It was against Sunderland and on that occasion Pochettino played him in central midfield alongside Wanyama in a 4-2-3-1 \u2013 with Dier dropping back to centre-half.</p> <p>The manager made the point that Dier had always started this season when fully fit and the reason he was used only as a substitute against City was because he was coming back from injury. It will be interesting to see whether Pochettino can find the room for him and Wanyama in midfield at The Hawthorns \u2013 and, further down the line, how he shapes the lineup when Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 is available.

And don\u2019t forget Harry Winks, who is coming and pushing a lot from behind. You have to look forward and carry on working.\u201d</p> <p>Tottenham enter a period of seven matches in 23 days and Pochettino knows that it will be essential to rotate his personnel and still find the right balance. \u201cWhen I was at Espanyol and Southampton, and at the beginning here at Tottenham, when we didn\u2019t take a good result, there were some comments that it was because we didn\u2019t have a plan B,\u201d Pochettino said. \u201cNow, we have a plan B.

  "<p>On this season\u2019s opening night, back in September, the <a href=\"http://nyphil.org/\">New York Philharmonic</a>\u2019s outgoing music director, <a href=\"http://alangilbert.com/\">Alan Gilbert, </a>led a subtly activist gala program that included Gershwin\u2019s Concerto in F. The performance was activist in nature because it allowed the night\u2019s soloist \u2013 jazz virtuoso <a href=\"http://www.aarondiehl.com/\">Aaron Diehl</a> \u2013 to improvise in and around Gershwin\u2019s written part. And it was subtle because the chance-taking worked so thoroughly and elegantly: an experimentalism that didn\u2019t have to call attention to itself.</p> <p>This week, the Philharmonic is making another of its periodic visits to one of New York\u2019s contemporary performance art palaces, the <a href=\"http://www.armoryonpark.org/\">Park Avenue Armory</a>. As usual, the venturesome quality of the trip outside Lincoln Center is being more explicitly underlined. This is the same site that saw Gilbert and the Philharmonic\u2019s performance of Stockhausen\u2019s multi-orchestral masterpiece <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZ7jpKh_UF0\">Gruppen</a> (along with \u201cspatial\u201d music by Mozart and Boulez). This time around, the organizational theme centered on the sumptuous textures of works by contemporary Finnish composer <a href=\"http://saariaho.org/\">Kaija Saariaho</a>, in a concert conducted by Philharmonic composer-in-residence <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/esa-pekka-salonen\">Esa-Pekka Salonen</a>.</p> <p>The composer-in-residence position is, by the way, another Gilbert innovation during his time at the Philharmonic. Perhaps the point is obvious, at this juncture, but it still bears repeating: in its stylistic flexibility and in its approach to repertoire, the Philharmonic is working at an unusually high level, under Gilbert\u2019s directorship. The point was underlined again on Thursday night\u2019s opening performance, the first of a two-night stand at the Armory. Helping round out the sense of the gig as an \u201cevent\u201d was video art accompaniment, supervised by director <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/04/arts/pierre-audi-is-set-to-become-artistic-director-of-park-avenue-armory.html\">Pierre Audi</a> (who\u2019s also prepping Rossini\u2019s Guillaume Tell at the Met).</p> <p>Any worries that the visuals would detract from concentration on the music were quickly vanquished, during the short opening orchestral piece, Lumi\u00e8re et Pesanteur. The overture-length work, dedicated to Salonen, was cinematic enough on its own. Early on, a pretty, delicate figure moved from a trumpet to a flute, while waves of strange harmony morphed as they passed through the wider orchestra. (The visual counterpoint was just a smoky series of cloud-like nimbuses.)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"206466acc96d1429f5e0e14318dd3204bb30f4d2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/206466acc96d1429f5e0e14318dd3204bb30f4d2/0_0_3000_2002/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Soprano Jennifer Zetlan gave a haunting performance of the electronics-and-vocals piece Lonh\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Soprano Jennifer Zetlan gave a haunting performance of the electronics-and-vocals piece Lonh.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stephanie Berger./?Stephanie Berger Photography.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Later, a harp and vibraphone emerged on the other side of a tutti passage, shimmering seductively together. Saariaho\u2019s music doesn\u2019t traffic in obvious sign-postings: there\u2019s rarely a strong pulse driving you toward a promised climax, or other similar clues to let you know when a turning point is in the offing. Big changes happen without much warning, and are all the more powerful for it.</p> <p>The meatiest piece on the evening\u2019s program was <a href=\"http://www.musicsalesclassical.com/composer/work/1350/43424\">D\u2019om le Vrai Sens</a> \u2013 a 2010 piece that I\u2019ve loved on a recording from the <a href=\"https://www.ondine.net/\">Ondine</a> label. Live, it took on a new power. Clarinetist <a href=\"http://www.karikriikku.com/\">Kari Kriikku</a> is the go-to performer for this sort of music. (Saariaho wrote this concerto for him.) He has a control over piercing multiphonics that is the equal of his poise in more \u201cregular\u201d melodic passages. At the Armory, he started out playing behind the audience risers, his sound echoing around us.</p> <p>Toward the beginning of the second movement, Kriikku appeared in the stalls, slow-marching (or dancing) his way toward the orchestra proper. Very Stockhausen-like, in its theatrical way. But the most important aspect \u2013 the music \u2013 was handled even better. The way he can extend the clarinet\u2019s range is a perfect match for Saariaho\u2019s unusual textures. He can place a note \u201ccleanly\u201d in front of a listener, and then agitate it into an unrecognizable, yet perfectly harmonized, sound.</p> <p>By the time of the second movement, Saariaho\u2019s writing depended less on these tricks \u2013 building out longer melodies for the clarinet and the string section. As the half-hour piece unfolded, Kriikku advanced toward the other players. In subsequent movements he danced through the percussion section, then past Salonen \u2013 while keeping perfect track of the brisk, thrashing lines in the fourth movement. At the close of this piece, the crowd wanted to give an ovation, but Salonen dampened this impulse with a pensive look and some quick fluttering of his fingers. The idea was to present all four of the Saariaho works without a break. </p> <p>The result was a little bit of confusion on the part of the audience, with listeners grasping programs \u2013 trying to figure out which piece was being performed. Given the generally ruminative quality of the Saariaho compositions on this 90-minute program, the lack of piece-specific closure might have contributed to some restlessness in the crowd. </p> <p>Still, the final two works came off well. Soprano <a href=\"http://www.jenniferzetlan.com/\">Jennifer Zetlan</a> gave a haunting performance of the electronics-and-vocals piece Lonh. (Her live singing doubled a recorded part by the soprano <a href=\"http://www.colbertartists.com/dawn-upshaw/\">Dawn Upshaw</a>, in a striking complication of the soloist\u2019s role.) The final work, 2012\u2019s Circle Map, was only slightly less impressive \u2013as its recorded recitations of Rumi\u2019s poetry sounded less well integrated into the overall writing. But even here, there were textures of uncommon beauty and imagination. Salonen had a clear sense of each piece, and the Philharmonic players never sounded anything but confident in Saariaho\u2019s prismatic, provocative music. </p>",
  "<p>An international tribunal has dismissed a multinational mining company\u2019s demand that the government of El Salvador pay $250m (\u00a3205m) in compensation for refusing to allow it to dig for gold in the tiny Central American country where the slogan, \u201cNo to mining, yes to life\u201d has become a national rallying cry.</p> <p>The tribunal, which ruled that OceanaGold\u2019s case was without merit, also ordered the firm to pay the Salvadoran government $8m to cover the majority of the country\u2019s legal costs.</p> <p>\u201cFor the people of Cabanas who have been fighting to defend their environment, it is mission accomplished,\u201d said El Salvador\u2019s attorney general, Douglas Mel\u00e9ndez Ruiz. \u201cIt is an important step for the country to have been victorious in this lawsuit.\u201d </p> <p>While an OceanaGold statement expressed disappointment at the verdict, the outcome was celebrated by civil society groups from El Salvador to Canada, although they questioned why the ruling in a case dating back to 2009 had taken so long. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Bernardo Belloso, president of the Association for the Development of El Salvador, part of a national roundtable opposed to metallic mining, said the ruling \u201cvindicates our right to determine our own development path\u201d.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>But he added: \u201cThis is a law suit that should never have been allowed.

It maintained throughout the case that OceanaGold failed to meet regulatory requirements for the requested permits. The country said OceanaGold lacked crucial environmental permissions, did not hold the rights to much of the land required for its project, and failed to submit a final feasibility study.</p> <p>The ICSID case against El Salvador is one of hundreds that corporations have filed against governments under the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jun/10/obscure-legal-system-lets-corportations-sue-states-ttip-icsid\">investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS)</a> system, a mechanism enshrined in thousands of international trade and investment treaties and some domestic laws.</p> <p>The system has become a flashpoint for opposition to the proposed Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership between the US and Europe, which would further extend the reach of ISDS.</p> <p>Jen Moore, Latin America programme coordinator at <a href=\"http://miningwatch.ca/\">MiningWatch Canada</a>, said: \u201cThis ruling is a relief, but it is not a win.

  "<p>During a news segment for WZRB\u2019s station in Sarasota, Florida, in 1974, broadcaster Christine Chubbuck stared directly into the camera and said: \u201cIn keeping with Channel 40\u2019s policy of bringing you the latest in blood and guts and in living color, you are going to see another first \u2013 attempted suicide.\u201d Moments later she shot herself.</p> <p>Chubbuck was rushed to the hospital immediately but died shortly after. Her suicide (or more specifically, the video of her final moments) has long been considered an urban legend, which lurks somewhere on the fringes of the internet. It\u2019s estimated that only a few hundred people saw the live broadcast when it occurred, and footage of her public suicide meanwhile remains mysteriously elusive.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jan/24/christine-review-rebecca-hall-astonishes-in-real-life-horror-story\">Christine review: Rebecca Hall astonishes in real-life horror story</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There are conflicting reports as to why. The station owner\u2019s wife claims to have put the recording in the custody of a \u201cvery large law firm\u201d following the passing of her husband, according to an in-depth report from <a href=\"http://www.vulture.com/2016/01/death-hags-christine-chubbuck-suicide-video.html\">Vulture</a>. Chubbuck\u2019s brother Greg tells a different story. In a February interview with <a href=\"http://people.com/crime/brother-of-christine-chubbuck-says-no-one-will-ever-find-tape-of-horrific-day/\">People</a>, he says his family got an injunction preventing the station from ever releasing the footage, and later had to turn the tapes over to \u201cauthorities\u201d after they were seized as evidence. Greg says the footage eventually landed back with his mother, Peg. \u201cI don\u2019t know to this day where it is,\u201d he told People. \u201cBut I know no one knows where it is, and no one ever will if I have anything to say about it.\u201d</p> <p>Now 40 years later, Chubbock\u2019s story has been revisited in two films that were among the standouts at Sundance film festival this January.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jan/24/kate-plays-christine-review-robert-greene-sundance-2016\">Kate Plays Christine</a>, Robert Greene\u2019s arty documentary about an actor struggling to inhabit Chubbuck; and Christine, Antonio Campos\u2019s moody character study, starring British actor Rebecca Hall as Chubbuck.<br></p> <p>Hall has a theory for why film-makers have deemed the subject suddenly relevant.</p> <p>\u201cMy access point to the 70s is films from that time, and they all have that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2013/nov/19/the-parallax-view-kennedy-assassination\">paranoiac quality</a>,\u201d Hall says. \u201cJournalism [at the time] moved into that sensationalized \u2018if it bleeds it leads\u2019 mentality. Certainly \u2018if it bleeds it leads\u2019 goes directly to [today\u2019s] clickbait mentality in news. The notion that fear can generate news is hardly alien in America right now.\u201d</p> <p>Still, Hall can\u2019t quite believe she got the chance to play a figure as damaged as Chubbuck. While Hall concedes that \u201cit\u2019s so great that women are being allowed to be heroes in big things\u201d, referring to the surge in popularity of female superheroes in Hollywood blockbusters,\u201d she believes \u201cthe next step is allowing women to be antiheroes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s the thing I want to do with my career,\u201d she adds. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve never got the opportunity because you never see those scripts for women.\u201d</p> <p>From the outset of Christine, which earned raves for Hall\u2019s performance at Sundance (Variety\u2019s Guy Lodge <a href=\"http://variety.com/2016/film/reviews/christine-review-1201687262/\">called</a> her \u201cdiscomfortingly electric\u201d), Campos depicts Chubbuck as a perfectionist with ambition to succeed in the male-dominated business of broadcast journalism. Her major hindrance: she lacks the requisite on-camera appeal that her job calls for \u2013 a factor everyone but her can see. When commissioned to interview a local fruit-seller for a light news segment, she can\u2019t even muster a genuine smile for her audience. Warmth doesn\u2019t come naturally to her, and for Hall those imperfections are what\u2019s appealing.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"d33eccf7475fab6223e311e6e4cc2efc4d244562\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d33eccf7475fab6223e311e6e4cc2efc4d244562/34_0_1032_619/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rebecca Hall in Christine\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rebecca Hall in Christine.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR/Sundance film festival</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cSome of my acting heroes have built careers on playing characters who do horrendous things \u2013 they\u2019re repellent and lovable,\u201d adds Hall. \u201cThey\u2019re not likable, but they\u2019re lovable. I think Christine is one of those characters.\u201d </p> <p>First-time screenwriter Craig Shilowich first learned of Chubbuck\u2019s death after coming upon \u201ca reductive story of her suicide\u201d online. \u201cI clicked on a website that listed the 10 craziest thing that happened on television, and her story was one of them,\u201d he recalls. </p> <p>After looking into her case he began to relate to Chubbuck on deeply personal terms: Shilowich also suffered from a \u201clong depressive episode\u201d. Shortly after enrolling at New York University as a film major, Shilowich says he was overtaken by a severe depression that \u201ccame out of nowhere\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cPreviously I was a straight-A student, I went to NYU, I had a lot of friends \u2013 and somewhere along the way, something went off track. I noticed the wheels in my head had gone wobbly,\u201d he says. </p> <p>Like Chubbuck, Shilowich continued about his day-to-day life with people around him largely unaware of what he was going through. Unlike Chubbuck, he eventually sought help, dropping out of a college for a semester to recover.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I found Christine\u2019s story I went: what if I didn\u2019t have loving relationships with people, what if I was a woman in a workplace dominated by men? It\u2019s not so hard to understand how things might go the way they went,\u201d Shilowich says. \u201cI was interested in exercising a personal feeling I had, and being honest to it \u2013 and showing it in a plain-faced way that humanized this person.\u201d </p> <p>Because of that approach, he says, Christine isn\u2019t merely a film about suicide \u2013 even though her death served as his entry point to her story. Chubbuck\u2019s shocking end is just \u201cpart of the story\u201d, he stresses. Or as Hall puts it: \u201cIt\u2019s about her life \u2013 it\u2019s not about her death.\u201d</p> <p><em>Christine opens 14 October in the US</em></p> <ul> <li><em>In the US, the National Suicide Prevention Hotline is 1-800-273-8255.</em><em> In the UK, the Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123.

  "<p>A silverback gorilla that escaped from its enclosure at <a href=\"https://www.zsl.org/zsl-london-zoo\">London zoo</a> has broken panes of glass at the attraction at least twice, the zoo has confirmed.</p> <p>Visitors to the attraction were locked in tea rooms and gift shops for an hour and armed police rushed to the zoo on Thursday evening after <a href=\"https://www.zsl.org/zsl-london-zoo/exhibits/gorilla-kingdom\">Kumbuka</a>, a dominant male gorilla, broke out of his enclosure into a secure keepers\u2019 area before being tranquillised by vets and returned to his den.</p> <p>ZSL London zoo said it was carrying out a full investigation into the event but described it as a \u201cminor incident\u201d, insisting the 29-stone (184kg) animal had \u201ccategorically\u201d not broken any glass during the escape.</p> <p>But the Guardian has learned that the gorilla, which the zoo has previously described as being \u201ca little bit on the destructive side\u201d, has twice broken windows at the large enclosure, most recently this spring. In that incident keepers were unable say if he had thrown a missile or himself at the glass, but determined from a footprint on the pane that Kumbuka had been responsible for the damage.</p> <p>A spokeswoman said on Friday night that windows in the Gorilla Kingdom were triple-laminated and at no point had the gorilla smashed through the glass, which was designed to stay in its frame even if shattered. \u201cZSL London zoo has recorded no events involving Kumbuka over the past six months that have raised concerns about safety,\u201d the zoo said in a statement.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video element--supporting\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2016/oct/14/gorilla-was-showing-whos-in-charge-says-london-zoo-keeper-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/57e36\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2805279\"            data-video-name=\"Gorilla likes showing who's in charge, says London zoo keeper \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"YouTube\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-5800b173e4b047a4eaafc629\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/10/14/161014Gorilla_KP-29681668_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/10/14/161014Gorilla_KP-29681668.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/10/14/161014Gorilla_KP-29681668_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2016/oct/14/gorilla-was-showing-whos-in-charge-says-london-zoo-keeper-video\">Gorilla likes showing who\u2019s in charge, says London zoo keeper</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Sources have claimed that the animal was able to get into the keepers\u2019 area, a double-height, caged-off section running along one side of the enclosure, after a door was left open. The zoo said it could not confirm any details about the cause until an investigation into the incident had concluded.</p> <p>London zoo says no member of the public was at risk, yet the incident inevitably has echoes of the incident at Cincinnati zoo in May, when a three-year-old boy was able to climb into the enclosure of a large silverback called <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/31/gorillas-shooting-harambe-cincinnati-zoo\">Harambe</a>, which was <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/30/gorilla-shot-cincinnati-zoo-child\">shot dead </a>before the child was harmed.</p> <p>On Friday, the morning after the night before, all was calm in Gorilla Kingdom. In the indoor section of the animals\u2019 den, a very large room crammed with ropes, logs and hammocks, a female was chewing on a leafy branch while an infant swung from a knotted rope, provoking squeals of delight from a group of watching schoolchildren. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>The large silverback sat at the very front of the enclosure, his back turned to the glass. For the most part he seemed dazed, still recovering from the tranquiliser dart, but occasionally he would slant a glance over his shoulder at those eagerly snapping his photograph only metres \u2013 and a thick pane of glass \u2013 away.</p> <p>\u201cI definitely wouldn\u2019t like to meet him,\u201d said Paul Yarwood from Dundee, who was visiting the zoo with his wife, son and grandson. He hadn\u2019t been worried when he heard about the escape, he said, saying: \u201cI\u2019m sure it was more likely to be human error than anything being unsafe.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t at all concerned,\u201d said Jessica Oakley, who was there with her two young sons. \u201cI felt more sad for the gorilla, to be honest.\u201d Did she feel it suggested the animal was unhappy? \u201cDefinitely.\u201d</p> <p>Inevitably, some campaigners have raised the same question. Primatologist Ian Redmond, chairman of conservation group the Gorilla Organisation, said the incident \u201chas again raised the public debate on the ethics of keeping great apes in captivity, and the plight of gorillas in general.</p> <p>\u201cIt is to be hoped that the inquiry into how the escape happened will extend to a behavioural study to determine why Kumbuka appears to be so stressed.\u201d</p> <p>Is Kumbuku particularly aggressive or agitated \u2013or is his behaviour just part of being an adult gorilla? In 2013, shortly after Kumbuka came to London from Paignton zoo, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2016/oct/14/gorilla-was-showing-whos-in-charge-says-london-zoo-keeper-video\">his keeper Dan Simmonds described him</a> as being \u201ca little bit on the destructive side\u201d. He said: \u201cWe were warned by his keepers from his previous zoo that he does have a bit of a thing for ripping enclosures apart . And he\u2019s been doing a bit of that. He\u2019s been ripping the trees down, throwing them at the glass.\u201d It was, added Simmonds, \u201cjust his way of saying: \u2018I\u2019m in charge \u2019.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.roehampton.ac.uk/postgraduate-courses/primate-biology-behaviour-and-conservation/index.html\">Stuart Semple, professor of evolutionary biology at Roehampton University</a>, told the Guardian that even aggressive or agitated behaviour did not necessarily mean the gorilla was miserable.</p> <p>\u201cGorillas in the wild are not completely pacific creatures. They do show aggression, and it is not unusual therefore to see aggression in an animal that\u2019s kept in captivity.\u201d He said his own research into gorilla behaviour had shown \u201cthere is no link between the number of visitors, the conditions they are kept in and the level of aggression they show\u201d.</p> <p>Stress, however, might be another matter. \u201cWe have good evidence that certain behaviours \u2013 scratching or fidgeting \u2013 is an indicator of anxiety, and in certain zoos those behaviours increase in frequency as visitor numbers go up and they get more noisy.\u201d</p> <p>According to <a href=\"https://www.ljmu.ac.uk/about-us/staff-profiles/faculty-of-science/natural-sciences-and-psychology/emily-bethell\">Dr Emily Bethell, senior lecturer in primate behaviour at Liverpool John Moores University</a>, the fact a captive gorilla was charging at the glass, banging on objects or throwing objects did not necessarily mean it was unhappy, since this was classic \u201cdisplay\u201d behaviour designed to assert his dominance.</p> <p>\u201cBut the problem can arise when this becomes a chronic situation, where he is being stared at by people, and is feeling under threat by being stared at day after day,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Certainly, Bethell said, the animal\u2019s \u201cescape\u201d \u2013 a word keepers were resisting at the attraction on Friday, insisting it was \u201ca very small incident\u201d \u2013 was likely to be accidental rather than anything premeditated. \u201cIf, for example, someone had left a door unlocked, it\u2019s very possible that a gorilla charging around displaying at the visitors might end up finding his way through it.\u201d</p> <p>The zoo was unable to confirm when its investigation into the incident will be concluded, but it was clear on Friday that while many visitors felt concerned by the animals\u2019 position, the zoo\u2019s conservation work made their captivity worthwhile.</p> <p>\u201cI do sometimes think that the way they are treated, the number of kids every day, is too much for the gorillas,\u201d said Nikhil Jha, visiting the zoo from Singapore with his two-year-old son, RJ. \u201cIf they are treated well, then I suppose it is OK. But captivity has its price.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>The family of Jermaine Baker, who was shot dead by police last year, have accused the IPCC of betraying them and failing to hold the Metropolitan police to account over the shooting.</p> <p>Baker, 28, was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/dec/17/police-marksman-arrested-shooting-suspect-dead-wood-green\">shot dead by a Met firearms officer in north London</a> on 11 December 2015. He was sitting in a car with two other men and was believed to have been planning to help a prisoner who was being brought to Wood Green crown court to escape.</p> <p>Five men, including the two in the car who survived the police shooting, were later convicted of an attempt to break a criminal out of a prison van. Baker was sitting in the front passenger seat of the car and was pronounced dead at the scene. A replica Uzi was found on the floor next to back seat. Baker was unarmed at the time he was fatally shot.</p> <p>Margaret Smith, 48, Baker\u2019s mother, speaking to the Guardian in her first newspaper interview, said she was struggling to come to terms with the loss of her beloved son.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"ed006c8bb5bd7124f71cff53e6835b5ea9ac37a0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ed006c8bb5bd7124f71cff53e6835b5ea9ac37a0/0_189_4500_2700/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jermaine\u2019s mother, Margaret Smith.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jermaine\u2019s mother, Margaret Smith.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Linda Nylind/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Smith said that initially she and other family members were building a relationship with the IPCC but now that relationship has been severely damaged. \u201cThe IPCC has failed me and my family,\u201d she said.</p> <p>The family\u2019s concerns about the IPCC relate to the commanding officer in the police operation that resulted in Baker being shot dead.</p> <p>On 4 October 2016, the officer, a Met tactical firearms commander, known as FE16, who was facing an IPCC allegation of gross misconduct in relation to his briefing of the firearms officers in the operation that led to Jermaine\u2019s death, retired from the police. As a result, he will avoid the possibility of disciplinary proceedings and sanction for any part his alleged failings may have played in Jermaine\u2019s death. He is not the police officer who fired the fatal shot.</p> <p>The Met firearms officer who fired the fatal shot is under criminal caution, with decisions pending on whether he will face a criminal trial.</p> <p>The family has called on the IPCC chairwoman, Dame Anne Owers, to meet with them to address those concerns.</p> <p>Initially the IPCC indicated that they would support legal action to prevent the police officer from retiring before the allegations against him could be investigated, but then they later decided that they would not support the family\u2019s legal action. The family took the legal action alone but the judge ruled that the officer should not be prevented from retiring. He has now retired. Baker\u2019s family say that the IPCC U-turn undermined their case.</p> <p>Smith said that although her son was shot dead by police in the morning of 1 December last year the family were not notified of his death until the evening.</p> <p>\u201cI just knew he was dead even before we were told,\u201d she said. \u201cHe used to message me a lot but that day I heard nothing from him all day and knew that something was wrong. Jermaine was a lovely boy. He used to visit his grandmother every day and help her out. He adored animals especially dogs and when he was younger he used to bring stray dogs home and asked me to look after them. He was a painter and decorator by trade, not a gang member as was initially stated. </p> <p>\u201cHe had some minor convictions but I knew nothing about his involvement with the plan to release the man from the prison van. Jermaine should have been put on trial for that and if he had been found guilty he should have been sent to prison but he should not have been shot dead by police. He was unarmed when he was shot dead. We are fighting for answers. This case cannot end the way all the other cases involving people who have died at the hands of the police have ended.\u201d</p> <p>Deborah Coles, director of Inquest, which is supporting Baker\u2019s family, condemned the IPCC for failing to take legal action against the Metropolitan police. \u201cWhen the IPCC refused to take legal action to prevent the officer\u2019s retirement, they refused to do their job and abandoned a grieving family to do it instead. </p> <p>\u201cWe need a police investigation body that protects the public by deterring misconduct and holding police to account. The IPCC has failed not only the Baker family, but all victims of alleged misconduct, all bereaved families and the wider public.\u201d</p> <p>IPCC commissioner Cindy Butts said: \u201cThe IPCC supported the view of Mr Baker\u2019s family that the officer should have been suspended to prevent his retirement, but the force declined our repeated requests to do so, leaving a legal challenge as the only option available.</p> <p>\u201cAt the time of the first hearing, our assessment of the allegations against the officer, was such that if proven, those allegations were likely to amount to gross misconduct meaning he could face dismissal. On that basis, we believed the judicial review could be successful. In the lead-up to the second hearing our analysis of the evidence continued so that the position had changed and it was the investigator\u2019s opinion that the allegations, if proved, would meet the lower threshold of misconduct only and could not lead to dismissal. At that point we immediately notified all parties concerned.<br></p> <p> \u201cWhile I understand this change in position and our subsequent decision was extremely disappointing for Mr Baker\u2019s family, it would be irresponsible for the IPCC to pursue a legal challenge with very little prospect of success. We are now focusing on bringing our investigation to a conclusion in the very near future and considering whether any officer should face a potential criminal charge or disciplinary hearing.\u201d</p> <p>The family\u2019s solicitor, Michael Oswald of Bhatt Murphy Solicitors, said: \u201cIt is very disappointing to see the IPCC attempting to avoid responsibility for its actions by issuing this statement, which is so patently misleading. The reality is reflected in a statement from the investigator who undertook the \u2018analysis of the evidence\u2019 to which Butts refers. </p> <p>\u201cThat statement, which was provided to the court on 30 September 2016, states clearly that in the investigator\u2019s view there \u2018was and remains an indication of gross misconduct\u2019 and that the outcome of an outstanding investigative action could result in a case to answer for gross misconduct.\u201d</p>",

It is Russia which stands accused \u2013 and credibly accused \u2013 of bombing an aid convoy. It is Russia and its Syrian ally that is fond of the \u201cdouble-tap\u201d tactic, dropping one bomb and then, after an interval which allows time for paramedics to arrive and start treating the injured, drops another on the same spot, killing the rescuers.</p> <p>Still, we mustn\u2019t get hysterical.

Chris Woods of the Airwars monitoring site put it succinctly: \u201cThe Russians\u2019 death rate probably outpaces the coalition by a rate of eight to one.\u201d Woods also made the important, but often overlooked, point that while the US and its allies have killed too many civilians \u2013 and one is too many \u2013 they are at least trying to avoid or limit such casualties. Russia is deliberately targeting civilians and civilian infrastructure.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vB6e3gEpjBA\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/vB6e3gEpjBA?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>None of this means, incidentally, that Boris Johnson was right to summon demonstrators to the gates of the Russian mission in London. It\u2019s not for him to issue such a call. A government minister engineering a supposedly spontaneous rally outside a despised foreign embassy is the sort of stunt you might expect from an authoritarian state like Iran or, come to think of it, Russia. It should not be the business of a democratic government. Chalk it up as yet more proof that Johnson has not yet made the transition from newspaper columnist to&#xa0;government minister, a transition which \u2013 given the evidence of him and his onetime fellow Brexiteer, Michael Gove \u2013 may not be such a good idea anyway.</p> <p>More serious was Johnson\u2019s call for \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/13/boris-johnson-military-options-against-syrian-regime-being-considered\" title=\"\">more kinetic options</a>\u201d in Syria, deploying the latest euphemism for military action. Anyone who has seen the dead and dying of Aleppo \u2013 and felt that urge for somebody, somewhere, to do something \u2013 will understand that impulse. But now Russia is so fully dug in, such a call is reckless. If the US were to enforce a no-fly zone, it could soon find itself in a direct military confrontation with Russia, a clash of the two cold war superpowers. It risks escalating a bloody civil war into something larger and yet more lethal.</p> <p>So what then? Stop the War says this is a matter \u201cfor the Syrian people alone\u201d, as if, were the US and the west only to butt out, Assad would generously launch a national consultation exercise, hold free and fair elections, perhaps with PR and women-only shortlists, and agree to be bound by the result.

They insist they can only influence western nations, that a protest outside the Russian embassy wouldn\u2019t make a \u201cblind bit of difference\u201d. But how can they be so sure?

Yet four of its five permanent members support coalitions that attack hospitals in Syria, Yemen and Sudan.</p> <p>On Saturday, Russia\u2019s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, and the US secretary of state, John Kerry, will meet in the Swiss city of Lausanne to consider steps toward settling the Syrian conflict. There is little expectation that anything will come of it. Russia is keen to win the Syrian war for Mr Assad at any cost \u2013 sending signals to the region\u2019s authoritarian regimes that it will fill the vacuum left by a weakened US. Egypt, which backed a Russian&#xa0;resolution in the security council that removed the demand for an end to air strikes on Aleppo, is apparently <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-egypt-russia-military-idUSKCN12C2E0\" title=\"\">in talks to site&#xa0;an Russian airbase on its soil</a>. The&#xa0;argument of power is winning over the power of argument.</p> <p>Such actions undermine the spirit and break the letter of international law. Despite the concept of universal jurisdiction, western governments prefer realpolitik. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/may/13/israel-tzipi-livni-diplomatic-immunity-uk\" title=\"\">In 2014 the Foreign Office granted temporary diplomatic immunity to Tzipi Livni</a>, then Israel\u2019s justice minister, to protect her against arrest for alleged war crimes. How can justice be seen to be blind when of the nine countries that the international criminal court has <a href=\"http://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/upfront/2016/03/icc-biased-african-countries-160311140721768.html\" title=\"\">opened inquiries into, eight are in Africa</a>? Little wonder African countries threaten to withdraw when they watch states in the Middle East commit crimes against humanity with impunity.</p> <p>Yet the answer to this is not despair. It cannot be. The construction of international humanitarian law represented real progress for humanity and it must not be abandoned. The evidence of war crimes must still be gathered, and their victims remembered. <a href=\"https://justiceinconflict.org/tag/commission-for-international-justice-and-accountability-cija/\" title=\"\">The&#xa0;Commission for International Justice and Accountability</a> has already begun collecting material on the Assad regime\u2019s actions with a view to potential prosecutions. If, in the future, the politics of Russia or Syria change, perhaps the leaders of those nations, who have blood on their hands, could have their day in court. This might yet happen. It has already happened once, to Chile\u2019s General Pinochet, who died under house arrest facing hundreds of charges of human rights abuse in 2004. This is a history lesson that Mr Putin and Mr Assad do not want to repeat but should be compelled to learn.</p> <p>The west, too, faces a chance to demonstrate that it does respect the constraints of international law. Soon western-backed Iraqi forces will aim to retake Mosul, Islamic State\u2019s last major stronghold in the country. The conduct of the battle will determine whether victory comes at an unacceptable humanitarian cost. The UN predicts that 1.2&#xa0;million people could be displaced. Safe passage needs to be ensured to the refugee camps, set up by agencies like Save the Children, outside of the battlefield. The Iraqi army has already bombarded civilian areas \u2013 and their Shia militias need reining in. Although Iraq is responsible for a judicious application of force, it is backed by London and Washington. Earlier this month, the foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, made the case for Britain\u2019s \u201csoft power\u201d to defend values enshrined in the UN charter. Mosul offers a chance to turn words into action and show that there is a better way to win a&#xa0;modern war.</p>",

  "<p>Midway through <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/oct/13/american-honey-review-andrea-arnold\">American Honey</a>, the film pulls in to the kerb, the action pauses for breath, and the heroine discusses her dreams with a passing trucker. The trucker tells her his dream is to visit the ocean. She tells him that hers is a home and a bundle of children. The sun sinks in the west, Bruce Springsteen plays on the stereo and this pivotal scene is almost too perfect. Make a film about gritty American life and, sooner or later, the dream will crawl in through the cracks.</p> <p>I\u2019m not even sure it has to be as gritty, restless and hungry a movie as American Honey. More likely it\u2019s just any US-set picture that sends its characters on a journey, that has them want something and set out to achieve it. The American dream, after all, is the ur-text of Hollywood and the founding principle of a nation that was always as much an idea as a physical place to be cultivated and plundered. Small wonder that film-makers are drawn back to it again and again, like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/the-great-gatsby\">Gatsby</a> contemplating the green light at the end of Daisy\u2019s dock. Some come to celebrate it (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jan/10/rocky-in-numbers--creed-sylvester-stallone\">Rocky</a>, Mr Smith Goes to Washington). Some come to damn it (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/jan/03/chinatown-review\">Chinatown</a>, Scarface).

Her route loops back and forth across the midwest, from strip malls and oil derricks to sterile McMansions perched on irrigated lawns. Inside the bus, the crew members thrill to songs of freedom and empowerment. Outside, they angle for subscriptions, spinning a different story at every door. They speak in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horatio_Alger_myth\">Horatio Alger</a>, working-hard-to-escape-poverty cliches. Theirs is the rags-to-riches life, yet it\u2019s clear from the start these kids are going nowhere fast.<br></p> <p>Director Andrea Arnold acknowledges her film is about the American Dream. \u201cI was aware of that when I was making it, but it\u2019s been fed back a lot to me since. It probably has to do with the idea of selling. These kids are supposedly selling magazines, but really they are selling themselves. That feels very American. So the environment in the bus is like a potted version of a bigger picture.\u201d<br></p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Road movies take the dream concept back to its frontier origins \u2026 that life was better and richer on the move</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It could be that the road movie is the best way to navigate the dream. It\u2019s the genre that seems to take the concept back to its frontier origins, to manifest destiny and the pursuit of happiness, the sense that life was somehow better and richer when it was lived on the move. \u201cThere is no truth but in transit,\u201d said the essayist <a href=\"http://www.biography.com/people/ralph-waldo-emerson-9287153\">Ralph Waldo Emerson</a> in the mid-19th century, while <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2004/apr/03/classics.history\">Alexis de Tocqueville</a> marvelled at the \u201cfeverish ardour\u201d of the rootless American. At a time when the New World was still freshly minted, the crown governor to Virginia was already identifying an impulse that suggested settlers would be forever unsettled, \u201cforever imagining that the lands farther off are still better than that upon which they are already settled. If they attained Paradise,\u201d he added tartly, \u201cthey would move on if they heard of a better place farther west.\u201d<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"658e662b43e17a23674c4ae82a03adb7915edc49\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/658e662b43e17a23674c4ae82a03adb7915edc49/0_0_1764_1170/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Feminist pioneers \u2026 Susan Sarandon, left, and Geena Davis in Thelman &amp; Louise, 1991.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"663\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Feminist pioneers \u2026 Susan Sarandon, left, and Geena Davis in Thelma and Louise, 1991.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Cinetext/Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Such restless striving is at the heart of every ambulatory picture about the American dream. It\u2019s there in 1939\u2019s Stagecoach, typically cited as the first great Hollywood western, which frames the coach as a microcosm of new American society, clattering through increasingly hostile terrain. And it\u2019s there in such road movies as Easy Rider, with its countercultural cowboys, or Thelma and Louise, with its feminist pioneers, or the existential Two-Lane Blacktop where the finish line\u2019s an illusion, the engine overheats and the very celluloid seems to catch and combust in the projector. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>When I went to America, I felt liberated, accepted for who I was. I started to think I could be all I wanted to be</p> <footer> <cite></cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Arnold was raised on a Kent housing estate. American Honey, backed by the BFI and Film4, is her first US-set feature. But she points out that, back in the late 1990s, she studied film-making in LA. It was America, then, that helped jump-start her career. \u201cGrowing up,\u201d she says, \u201cI was always very conscious of my class. I basically come from a working-class background. But when I went to America, I felt liberated, accepted for who I was as opposed to where I came from. I started to think I could be all I wanted to be, live the idealised life. So I understand the mindset. It\u2019s very seductive. But how does it work if you\u2019re a kid from a small town with no industry and no work except what you can get at the fast-food restaurant? How do you rise above all that and find some self-belief?\u201d For many \u2013 for most \u2013 the American dream is just that.</p> <p>If Arnold\u2019s film has an ancestor, it may be <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRjpqJozOcI\">The Grapes of Wrath</a>, John Ford\u2019s searing 1940 odyssey adapted from the Steinbeck bestseller and charting the voyage of a family of dustbowl migrants. Like Star, the Joads hail from Oklahoma. Like her, they are chasing the promise of a better life. And like American Honey, Ford\u2019s drama aims for an unvarnished, social-realist intensity, documenting the desperate lives of a marginalised underclass. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d448e4c3fc62f3be6fb1ffdf8862fe81894feba0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d448e4c3fc62f3be6fb1ffdf8862fe81894feba0/0_0_2351_1754/1000.jpg\" alt=\"For a better life \u2026 The Grapes of Wrath, 1940.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"746\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">For a better life \u2026 The Grapes of Wrath, 1940.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Cinetext</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But there are major differences. In American Honey, for instance, there is no particular place to go. There\u2019s no fiery <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2014/dec/29/families-in-literature-the-joads-in-the-grapes-of-wrath-by-john-steinbeck\">Tom Joad</a> at the centre, clamouring for social change. Nor are there many obvious villains intent on bringing these 21st-century hobos to heel. Instead, they are sent bobbing through an apolitical, atomised, zero-hours environment where everybody else appears to be in pretty much the same boat. The magazine vendors aren\u2019t targeted \u2013 they\u2019re ignored, and this affords them a weightless euphoria.<br></p> <p>It is this quality, I suspect, that makes the film so special. On my first viewing, I filed it as a bizarrely joyous and exuberant picture, despite its harsh subject matter. After watching it a second time, I think it might be more complex. More likely the joy and the subject matter are indivisible, each dependent on the other. Some films come to prop up the faltering, debased notion of <a href=\"https://iantyrrell.wordpress.com/papers-and-comments/\">American exceptionalism</a>; others to expose it as a bright and shining lie. But American Honey sees the dream for what it is \u2013 a fantasy born out of hardship \u2013 and appreciates it on its own terms. Intuitively Arnold\u2019s film understands that the trip is usually more exciting than the destination, that the pursuit is invariably more authentic than the happiness at the end. Or, to put it another way, in chasing after the dream we are, in fact, already living it.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1SpWZm1PLc\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/y1SpWZm1PLc?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption><a href=\"https://youtu.be/y1SpWZm1PLc\">Video: watch the trailer for American Honey</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>If American Honey is fuelled by a sense of hope and possibility, Arnold believes that this is largely thanks to the cast. The majority are non-professional actors, plucked from skate-parks and Wal-Mart lots. They all came from difficult circumstances but, she insists, they all brought their own spirit, a spark of undimmed potential. \u201cSome of their lives have changed as a result of the film. Some got jobs or moved away from abusive partners. The film gave them a small sense of control of their lives.\u201d<br></p> <p>It would be nice to credit American Honey with providing the cast with the dream \u2013 or at least a convenient leg-up towards it. But that\u2019s too much the Hollywood happy ending. It doesn\u2019t account for the other pitfalls on the road, the fact that people can backslide and circumstances can change. It may even run counter to the abiding spirit of the film \u2013 which exults in the freewheeling abandon that comes from having nothing much left to lose, the thrill of whipping through the fringes of an unfamiliar city with the music up loud and the sunroof thrown back to show off the stars. All around is a humdrum nightmare of dead-end jobs and foreclosed homes, vacant lots on the endless road. But in the middle, in the moment, there\u2019s the American dream.<br></p> <ul> <li>American Honey is out now.<br></li> </ul>",

That\u2019s very sweet of you. I love you guys too. I can\u2019t believe it\u2019s just a few weeks before election day, as we come together to support the next president and vice-president of the United States, Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine! And New Hampshire is going to be important, as always.</p> <p>So I\u2019m going to get a little serious here, because I think we can all agree that this has been a rough week in an already rough election. This week has been particularly interesting for me personally because it has been a week of profound contrast.</p> <p>See, on Tuesday, at the White House, we celebrated the International Day of the Girl and Let Girls Learn, and it was a wonderful celebration. It was the last event that I\u2019m going to be doing as first lady for Let Girls Learn. And I had the pleasure of spending hours talking to some of the most amazing young women you will ever meet, young girls here in the US and all around the world. And we talked about their hopes and their dreams. We talked about their aspirations. See, because many of these girls have faced unthinkable obstacles just to attend school, jeopardizing their personal safety, their freedom, risking the rejection of their families and communities.</p> <p>So I thought it would be important to remind these young women how valuable and precious they are. I wanted them to understand that the measure of any society is how it treats its women and girls. And I told them that they deserve to be treated with dignity and respect, and I told them that they should disregard anyone who demeans or devalues them, and that they should make their voices heard in the world. And I walked away feeling so inspired, just like I\u2019m inspired by all the young people here \u2013 and I was so uplifted by these girls. That was Tuesday.</p> <p>And now, here I am, out on the campaign trail in an election where we have consistently been hearing hurtful, hateful language about women \u2013 language that has been painful for so many of us, not just as women, but as parents trying to protect our children and raise them to be caring, respectful adults, and as citizens who think that our nation\u2019s leaders should meet basic standards of human decency.</p> <p>The fact is that in this election, we have a candidate for president of the United States who, over the course of his lifetime and the course of this campaign, has said things about women that are so shocking, so demeaning that I simply will not repeat anything here today. And last week, we saw this candidate actually bragging about sexually assaulting women. And I can\u2019t believe that I\u2019m saying that a candidate for president of the United States has bragged about sexually assaulting women.</p> <p>And I have to tell you that I can\u2019t stop thinking about this. It has shaken me to my core in a way that I couldn\u2019t have predicted. So while I\u2019d love nothing more than to pretend like this isn\u2019t happening, and to come out here and do my normal campaign speech, it would be dishonest and disingenuous of me to just move on to the next thing like this was all just a bad dream.</p> <p>This is not something that we can ignore. It\u2019s not something we can just sweep under the rug as just another disturbing footnote in a sad election season. Because this was not just a \u201clewd conversation\u201d. This wasn\u2019t just locker-room banter. This was a powerful individual speaking freely and openly about sexually predatory behavior, and actually bragging about kissing and groping women, using language so obscene that many of us were worried about our children hearing it when we turn on the TV.</p> <p>And to make matters worse, it now seems very clear that this isn\u2019t an isolated incident. It\u2019s one of countless examples of how he has treated women his whole life. And I have to tell you that I listen to all of this and I feel it so personally, and I\u2019m sure that many of you do too, particularly the women. The shameful comments about our bodies. The disrespect of our ambitions and intellect. The belief that you can do anything you want to a woman.</p> <p>It is cruel. It\u2019s frightening. And the truth is, it hurts. It hurts. It\u2019s like that sick, sinking feeling you get when you\u2019re walking down the street minding your own business and some guy yells out vulgar words about your body. Or when you see that guy at work that stands just a little too close, stares a little too long, and makes you feel uncomfortable in your own skin.</p> <p>It\u2019s that feeling of terror and violation that too many women have felt when someone has grabbed them, or forced himself on them and they\u2019ve said no but he didn\u2019t listen \u2013 something that we know happens on college campuses and countless other places every single day. It reminds us of stories we heard from our mothers and grandmothers about how, back in their day, the boss could say and do whatever he pleased to the women in the office, and even though they worked so hard, jumped over every hurdle to prove themselves, it was never enough.</p> <p>We thought all of that was ancient history, didn\u2019t we? And so many have worked for so many years to end this kind of violence and abuse and disrespect, but here we are in 2016 and we\u2019re hearing these exact same things every day on the campaign trail. We are drowning in it. And all of us are doing what women have always done: we\u2019re trying to keep our heads above water, just trying to get through it, trying to pretend like this doesn\u2019t really bother us maybe because we think that admitting how much it hurts makes us as women look weak.</p> <p>Maybe we\u2019re afraid to be that vulnerable. Maybe we\u2019ve grown accustomed to swallowing these emotions and staying quiet, because we\u2019ve seen that people often won\u2019t take our word over his. Or maybe we don\u2019t want to believe that there are still people out there who think so little of us as women. Too many are treating this as just another day\u2019s headline, as if our outrage is overblown or unwarranted, as if this is normal, just politics as usual.</p> <p>But, New Hampshire, be clear: this is not normal. This is not politics as usual. This is disgraceful. It is intolerable. And it doesn\u2019t matter what party you belong to \u2013 Democrat, Republican, independent \u2013 no woman deserves to be treated this way. None of us deserves this kind of abuse.</p> <p>And I know it\u2019s a campaign, but this isn\u2019t about politics. It\u2019s about basic human decency. It\u2019s about right and wrong. And we simply cannot endure this, or expose our children to this any \u2013 not for another minute, and let alone for four years. Now is the time for all of us to stand up and say enough is enough. This has got to stop right now.</p> <p>Because consider this: if all of this is painful to us as grown women, what do you think this is doing to our children? What message are our little girls hearing about who they should look like, how they should act? What lessons are they learning about their value as professionals, as human beings, about their dreams and aspirations? And how is this affecting men and boys in this country? Because I can tell you that the men in my life do not talk about women like this. And I know that my family is not unusual. And to dismiss this as everyday locker-room talk is an insult to decent men everywhere.</p> <p>The men that you and I know don\u2019t treat women this way. They are loving fathers who are sickened by the thought of their daughters being exposed to this kind of vicious language about women. They are husbands and brothers and sons who don\u2019t tolerate women being treated and demeaned and disrespected. And like us, these men are worried about the impact this election is having on our boys who are looking for role models of what it means to be a man.</p> <p>In fact, someone recently told me a story about their six-year-old son who one day was watching the news \u2013 they were watching the news together. And the little boy, out of the blue, said, \u201cI think Hillary Clinton will be president.\u201d And his mom said, \u201cWell, why do you say that?\u201d And this little six-year-old said, \u201cBecause the other guy called someone a piggy and,\u201d he said, \u201cYou cannot be president if you call someone a piggy.\u201d</p> <p>So even a six-year-old knows better. A six-year-old knows that this is not how adults behave. This is not how decent human beings behave. And this is certainly not how someone who wants to be president of the United States behaves.</p> <p>Because let\u2019s be very clear: strong men \u2013 men who are truly role models \u2013 don\u2019t need to put down women to make themselves feel powerful. People who are truly strong lift others up. People who are truly powerful bring others together. And that is what we need in our next president. We need someone who is a uniting force in this country. We need someone who will heal the wounds that divide us, someone who truly cares about us and our children, someone with strength and compassion to lead this country forward.</p> <p>And let me tell you, I\u2019m here today because I believe with all of my heart that Hillary Clinton will be that president.</p> <p>See, we know that Hillary is the right person for the job because we\u2019ve seen her character and commitment not just in this campaign, but over the course of her entire life. The fact is that Hillary embodies so many of the values that we try so hard to teach our young people. We tell our young people \u201cwork hard in school, get a good education\u201d. We encourage them to use that education to help others \u2013 which is exactly what Hillary did with her college and law degrees, advocating for kids with disabilities, fighting for children\u2019s healthcare as first lady, affordable childcare in the Senate.</p> <p>We teach our kids the value of being a team player, which is what Hillary exemplified when she lost the 2008 election and actually agreed to work for her opponent as our secretary of state \u2013 earning sky-high approval ratings serving her country once again.</p> <p>We also teach our kids that you don\u2019t take shortcuts in life, and you strive for meaningful success in whatever job you do. Well, Hillary has been a lawyer, a law professor, first lady of Arkansas, first lady of the United States, a US senator, secretary of state. And she has been successful in every role, gaining more experience and exposure to the presidency than any candidate in our lifetime \u2013 more than Barack, more than Bill. And, yes, she happens to be a woman.</p> <p>And finally, we teach our kids that when you hit challenges in life, you don\u2019t give up, you stick with it. Well, during her four years as secretary of state alone, Hillary has faced her share of challenges. She\u2019s traveled to 112 countries, negotiated a ceasefire, a peace agreement, a release of dissidents. She spent 11 hours testifying before a congressional committee. We know that when things get tough, Hillary doesn\u2019t complain. She doesn\u2019t blame others. She doesn\u2019t abandon ship for something easier. No, Hillary Clinton has never quit on anything in her life.</p> <p>So in Hillary, we have a candidate who has dedicated her life to public service, someone who has waited her turn and helped out while waiting. She is an outstanding mother. She has raised a phenomenal young woman. She is a loving, loyal wife. She\u2019s a devoted daughter who cared for her mother until her final days. And if any of us had raised a daughter like Hillary Clinton, we would be so proud. We would be proud.</p> <p>And regardless of who her opponent might be, no one could be more qualified for this job than Hillary \u2013 no one. And in this election, if we turn away from her, if we just stand by and allow her opponent to be elected, then what are we teaching our children about the values they should hold, about the kind of life they should lead? What are we saying?</p> <p>In our hearts, we all know that if we let Hillary\u2019s opponent win this election, then we are sending a clear message to our kids that everything they\u2019re seeing and hearing is perfectly OK. We are validating it. We are endorsing it. We\u2019re telling our sons that it\u2019s OK to humiliate women. We\u2019re telling our daughters that this is how they deserve to be treated. We\u2019re telling all our kids that bigotry and bullying are perfectly acceptable in the leader of their country. Is that what we want for our children?</p> <p>And remember, we won\u2019t just be setting a bad example for our kids, but for our entire world. Because for so long, America has been a model for countries across the globe, pushing them to educate their girls, insisting that they give more rights to their women. But if we have a president who routinely degrades women, who brags about sexually assaulting women, then how can we maintain our moral authority in the world? How can we continue to be a beacon of freedom and justice and human dignity?</p> <p>Well, fortunately, New Hampshire, here\u2019s the beauty: we have everything we need to stop this madness. You see, while our mothers and grandmothers were often powerless to change their circumstances, today, we as women have all the power we need to determine the outcome of this election.</p> <p>We have knowledge. We have a voice. We have a vote. And on November the 8th, we as women, we as Americans, we as decent human beings can come together and declare that enough is enough, and we do not tolerate this kind of behavior in this country.</p> <p>Remember this: in 2012, women\u2019s votes were the difference between Barack winning and losing in key swing states, including right here in New Hampshire. So for anyone who might be thinking that your one vote doesn\u2019t really matter, or that one person can\u2019t really make a difference, consider this: back in 2012, Barack won New Hampshire by about 40,000 votes, which sounds like a lot. But when you break that number down, the difference between winning and losing this state was only 66 votes per precinct. Just take that in. If 66 people in each precinct had gone the other way, Barack would have lost.</p> <p>So each of you right here today could help swing an entire precinct and win this election for Hillary just by getting yourselves, your families, and your friends and neighbors out to vote. You can do it right here. But you could also help swing an entire precinct for Hillary\u2019s opponent with a protest vote or by staying home out of frustration.</p> <p>Because here\u2019s the truth: either Hillary Clinton or her opponent will be elected president this year. And if you vote for someone other than Hillary, or if you don\u2019t vote at all, then you are helping to elect her opponent. And just think about how you will feel if that happens. Imagine waking up on November the 9th and looking into the eyes of your daughter or son, or looking into your own eyes as you stare into the mirror. Imagine how you\u2019ll feel if you stayed home, or if you didn\u2019t do everything possible to elect Hillary.</p> <p>We simply cannot let that happen. We cannot allow ourselves to be so disgusted that we just shut off the TV and walk away. And we can\u2019t just sit around wringing our hands. Now, we need to recover from our shock and depression and do what women have always done in this country. We need you to roll up your sleeves. We need to get to work. Because remember this: When they go low, we go \u2026</p> <p>Audience: High!</p> <p>Yes, we do.</p> <p>And voting ourselves is a great start, but we also have to step up and start organizing. So we need you to make calls and knock on doors and get folks to the polls on election day and sign up to volunteer with one of the Hillary campaign folks who are here today just waiting for you to step up.</p> <p>And, young people and not-so-young people, get on social media. Share your own story of why this election matters, why it should matter for all people of conscience in this country. There is so much at stake in this election.</p> <p>See, the choice you make November 8 could determine whether we have a president who treats people with respect \u2013 or not. A president who will fight for kids, for good schools, for good jobs for our families \u2013 or not. A president who thinks that women deserve the right to make our own choices about our bodies and our health \u2013 or not. That\u2019s just a little bit of what\u2019s at stake.</p> <p>So we cannot afford to be tired or turned off. And we cannot afford to stay home on election day. Because on November the 8th, we have the power to show our children that America\u2019s greatness comes from recognizing the innate dignity and worth of all our people. On November the 8th, we can show our children that this country is big enough to have a place for us all \u2013 men and women, folks of every background and walk of life \u2013 and that each of us is a precious part of this great American story, and we are always stronger together.</p> <p>On November 8, we can show our children that here in America, we reject hatred and fear and in difficult times, we don\u2019t discard our highest ideals. No, we rise up to meet them. We rise up to perfect our union. We rise up to defend our blessings of liberty. We rise up to embody the values of equality and opportunity and sacrifice that have always made this country the greatest nation on Earth.</p> <p>That is who we are. And don\u2019t ever let anyone tell you differently. Hope is important. Hope is important for our young people. And we deserve a president who can see those truths in us \u2013 a president who can bring us together and bring out the very best in us. Hillary Clinton will be that president.</p> <p>So for the next 26 days, we need to do everything we can to help her and Tim Kaine win this election. I know I\u2019m going to be doing it. Are you with me? Are you all with me? You ready to roll up your sleeves? Get to work knocking on doors?</p> <p>All right, let\u2019s get to work. Thank you all. God bless.</p> <p><em>This transcript was released by the White House Office of the First Lady</em></p>",
  "<p>As a volunteer for a trust of the type advocated by Simon Jenkins (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/10/save-ailing-churches-desanctified-secularised\">One sure way to save our churches \u2013 give them away</a>, 10 October) I read his article with interest but feel that his analysis is mistaken. The cathedrals whose recent success he extols are located in the centres of large populations. In contrast, the disused rural churches that I help to look after are remote, often not part of any settlement that could be described as even a small village. In these cases there is no community for which to provide the type of facilities that Jenkins envisages; the former inhabitants have moved away.</p> <p>The church buildings that remain cannot be adapted except at great expense, and probably major changes in listed building law. They generally lack sanitation and a water supply; heating systems are either non-existent or antiquated and they are freezing in winter. Their fabric is crumbling and they are surrounded by churchyards that are protected from development by law and reverence for, or superstitious fear of, the dead. They are practically inaccessible by public transport but lack parking provision.</p> <p>There is no easy answer but I think the Church of England is right to hold on to as many of its buildings as possible; even tiny congregations constitute some kind of community and have the potential to expand. Once abandoned, most of our churches will, and do, become empty museum pieces of value and interest to no one except a very few passing visitors. <br><strong>Roger Barham</strong><br><em>York</em></p> <p>\u2022 Simon Jenkins misses the point if he sees churches as square footage and history. Every day, they are open for all as a place of prayer. This is our USP. It is what people crave in their darkest hours and in their times of joy. We provide a place for people to refresh their soul. People value churches as churches. We care for 45% of the Grade I listed buildings in England and our churches are in a better state of repair now than ever. Churches are for the community, from play groups to lunch clubs for the elderly. Church floors and halls are key to the cohesion of communities. There are many examples of wider shared use of our buildings and creative ways to keep them open, with more in the pipeline. Cathedrals, which Jenkins rightly praises, were at risk a generation ago. Thank goodness they were not dealt with then in the manner he is now suggesting for the churches of our land.<br><strong>Rt Rev Dr John Inge</strong><br><em>Bishop of Worcester and lead bishop on church buildings for the Church of England </em></p> <p>\u2022 Simon Jenkins is both right and wrong about church buildings. Our 13th-century village church last week held a communion service, a monthly family service, and a baptism. Overall attendance was 250. There was music, prayer, thanksgiving, storytelling for more than 50 children, and celebration aplenty. Our community come to their village church because they feel welcome. Many will subsequently come to be married, or to have children baptised, or to mark a loss. Of course, more occasional worshippers contribute only fractionally to average attendance, which was always an unsatisfactory measure of the deep and persistent thirst for spiritual nurture met by the rich diversity of churches up and down the land.</p> <p>The overstatement of the Church of England\u2019s demise is clear from recent rising cathedral statistics which measure the broader, deeper feelings that people have for church, the space for Christian faith in their lives as well as the building\u2019s role as a place of history, beauty and architectural heritage.</p> <p>Parish churches are not so different from cathedrals. They too can be both used and loved and we can avoid the errors of the \u201cBeeching solution\u201d. Local communities, worshipping and visiting contribute \u00a3795m a year for churches and clergy, and this shows their love for the church. Churches have a purpose so let us not give them away. It is better to have a railway line that goes somewhere, that connects with the trunk routes and is there when we need to travel with it.<br><strong>Rev Steve Wood</strong><br><em>St Margaret\u2019s Streatley, Bedfordshire</em></p> <p>\u2022 It is disturbing that someone in such an influential position (ex-chair of the National Trust and trustee of the Churches Conservation Trust) should offer such simplistic views on the predicament of our churches. Central to Simon Jenkins\u2019 thinking is the misuse of statistics: he conflates the decline of Anglicanism with the demise of the buildings of our Christian past. From this confusion he builds a portrait of gloom, seeing the plight of our churches through a cliched business model \u2013 a re-run of Dr Beeching\u2019s verdict with churches as unremunerative branch lines.</p> <p>I challenge this gloom-laden vision. Churches have touched me all my life (a clergy child, 20 years a field officer with the Churches Conservation Trust and a member of the Norwich DAC). This long connection is witness to a more complex picture. In Norfolk, privileged to enjoy the greatest concentration of medieval religious buildings in Europe, our cathedral is not the only building to be visited. Our rural churches, on the whole wonderfully cared for, are not locked and forlorn. Visitors\u2019 books prove they are regularly attended, but their \u201ccongregations\u201d (fed ironically on Jenkins\u2019 <a href=\"https://www.bookdepository.com/Englands-Thousand-Best-Churches-Simon-Jenkins/9780713992816#\">England\u2019s Thousand Best Churches</a>) are a motley crew of Christians, agnostics and unbelievers. All, however, confirm Philip Larkin\u2019s view that there remains a hunger for \u201cserious places\u201d that \u201cnever can be obsolete\u201d.</p> <p>Jenkins\u2019 definition of the church\u2019s problem is inaccurate and his solution facile. His suggestion that church buildings should be \u201cgiven away\u201d and vested in local trusts or parish councils naively ignores the central question of resources (both financial and expertise), which just don\u2019t exist in these localities.</p> <p>He needs to change tack and use his undoubted talents as a journalist to raise awareness and ask questions. Conservation of our Christian heritage is ultimately a national and not a local responsibility \u2013 a responsibility that can only be adequately resourced through taxation.</p> <p>Our churches matter; they do involve cost \u2013 but what (a question Dr Beeching didn\u2019t ask) is the cost of losing them?<br><strong>Kate Weaver</strong><br><em>Norwich</em></p> <p>\u2022 Simon Jenkins doesn\u2019t seem to realise (perhaps because he apparently stays well away) that there are countless growing congregations in historic churches who would like nothing better than to give their building away. The living church is constantly frustrated by the severe restrictions to worship and welcome imposed by church buildings conceived in a bygone age, and by a heritage lobby with little understanding of what a church is actually for. By all means let the state, or a local trust, pay the maintenance bills so that the church can get on with the work of the kingdom of God.<br><strong>Very Rev Richard Giles</strong><br><em>Tynemouth, Tyne &amp; Wear</em></p> <p>\u2022 Given the title of Simon Jenkins\u2019 article I was surprised he didn\u2019t mention the French solution, whereby church buildings belong to local or national government and are only allowed to be used for religious services on condition that they are available for secular use, eg for exhibitions and concerts, the rest of the time.<br><strong>Harry Watson</strong><br><em>Edinburgh</em></p> <p>\u2022 Bishop Richard Harries (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/10/the-church-and-other-institutions-in-decline\">Letters</a>, 11 October) cannot be allowed to get away with his reference to a \u201cdramatic decline in membership of political parties\u201d in an attempt to understand the numerical decline of the Church of England.</p> <p>Our local North Devon Labour party has doubled in size in the last year. Nationally the party has gained 100,000 new members since the EU referendum and now has over half a million members.

One of Trump\u2019s few remaining loyal supporters in the party, running mate Mike Pence, has promised his boss will respond swiftly and specifically to the deluge of recent sexual abuse allegations. Others, such as a former candidate Ben Carson, say \u201cit doesn\u2019t matter\u201d whether Trump accusers are \u201clying or not\u201d because bigger issues are at stake for America. What matters is that \u201cthe train is going off the cliff\u201d, Trump\u2019s erstwhile opponent told CNN on Friday.</p> <p>But the reason that many other party leaders, such as the House speaker, Paul Ryan, have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/10/paul-ryan-ends-support-trump-campaign-endorsement-republicans\">deserted their candidate</a> in recent days is that the real battle has now shifted from the White House to Congress.</p> <p>Despite a naturally favourable set of Senate races up for Democrats this cycle, Republicans had hoped there was a chance of holding on to control of the upper chamber thanks to strong candidates such as Marco Rubio in Florida and John McCain in Arizona. But the Trump effect now seems to be hurting them whether they distance themselves from the nominee or not. The <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/polls-clinton-ahead-florida-pennsylvania-n662076\">latest Florida poll</a> shows Rubio clinging to just a two-point lead, while McCain has finally unendorsed Trump.</p> <p>For Democrats, the dithering of uncertain Republicans is irresistible. \u201cI understand that Ted [Strickland]\u2019s opponent has finally withdrawn his support from Donald Trump, after looking at the polling, now that it\u2019s politically expedient,\u201d Obama said of his party\u2019s rival in Ohio. \u201cBut he supported him up until last week.

  "<p>On paper, there are many reasons to be concerned about Goliath. It\u2019s the type of \u201cprestige drama\u201d that the age of Peak TV has flooded us with.

Most of that has to do with the man playing the anti-hero, Billy Bob Thornton, whose expertise always surprises me even though he has proven himself countless times (including on television with an excellent turn in the first season of Fargo). </p> <p>He plays Billy McBride, a man whose alcoholism is even worse than his haircut and his goatee, and who founded one of the most powerful law firms in the world only to be ousted from it because of his bad behavior and a spectacular fallout with his partner, Donald Cooperman (William Hurt). Now a bottom-feeder who arranges plea deals for petty drug criminals whose names he can\u2019t remember, he ends up back in the firm\u2019s orbit when he takes a personal injury case where a woman\u2019s brother supposedly committed suicide by blowing up a boat in the middle of the ocean. The boat is owned by the technology company where he worked, which is the firm\u2019s client, so McBride and Cooperman get to grind their considerable axes once again. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5_1LKLtLro\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/k5_1LKLtLro?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>It\u2019s a completely unlikely scenario, chock full of the sort of drama you only find on television, like Billy\u2019s ex-wife Michelle (Maria Bello) still working at the firm and McBride being harassed by a string of shady characters after he takes the case, but it\u2019s mostly forgivable since the mystery is so intriguing and the characters so vibrant. </p> <p> Master producer David E Kelley (Boston Legal, Ally McBeal, Picket Fences) has had a string of misfires in recent years but acquits himself nicely with his latest effort, co-created with Jonathan Shapiro. Kelley is used to working in the procedural mode, but what he\u2019s created here is more of a noir, with the down-and-out detective trying to do the right thing in seedy LA with one little case that has the ability to shake the halls of power. There\u2019s even a shot of a woman with the shadow of the blinds cast across her eyes. That\u2019s how you know it\u2019s a noir. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/oct/05/frequency-tv-review-dennis-quaid\">Frequency review \u2013 time travel thriller is surprise small screen winner</a> </p> </aside>  <p>What really fuels any good noir, of course, is a femme fatale, and luckily this show has a whole host of them, including the exasperated Michelle, Callie Senate (Deadwood and House of Cards\u2019 Molly Parker), the baddest lawyer at Cooperman McBride who is taking on Billy in court, her stuttering number two Lucy (Olivia Thirlby) and Brittany (Tania Raymonde), the prostitute who serves as Billy\u2019s paralegal. Yes, you read that right.</p> <p> This is where Kelley, whose characters are always a bundle of tics and strange obsessions, goes a little too far. Thornton\u2019s performance and the gorgeous way the show is filmed is so naturalistic that it\u2019s jarring when the fanciful invades. We see Cooperman, with his face half burned off, sitting in a dark room snapping one of those dog training clickers to get those around him to stop talking. He would be more believable if he were clutching a cat and tittering about his plans for world domination. </p> <p>Thankfully the show is saved by Billy and a host of other characters, chiefly his tough-talking associate Patty (Tony winner Nina Arianda), the kind of woman who rushes around wearing designer sunglasses with two bucket bags slung on her shoulder but will curse someone out (usually Billy) as soon as they order a pumpkin spice latte. With only eight episodes, hopefully we won\u2019t have enough time to get sick of these people, and their nefarious interconnections will be enough to keep us clicking on the next episode in an intense fit of bingeing. As I said, most of that can be laid at the feet of Thornton, who plays a character that we should hate, but he\u2019s a David you can\u2019t help rooting for. </p>",

Over the coming parliament we will go further. We will review the roles and responsibilities of local authorities.

We do it not because it is easy - it\u2019s not - but because it is in the national interest. We believe that national interest lies in placing power in the people of this country\u2019s hands.

She wants Scotland to stay in the single market, even if the rest of the UK leaves as a result of Brexit, and although she reaffirmed that she believes this might result in Scotland having to hold a second independence referendum, she also spoke at some length about alternative options.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Sturgeon said she wanted to explore \u201ccreative\u201d solutions that might allow Scotland to stay in the single market, even if the rest of the UK leaves.</strong> She said she would be publishing detailed proposals soon. There were various options, she suggested.</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The point I would make, and it\u2019s quite a fundamental point, is we are in unchartered territory here. Article 50 is the only rule that exists for what happens now. No country was every expected to ever want to leave the EU. So to some extent the UK as a whole is sitting with a blank sheet of paper. There is an ability to be creative, and to look at different options that respect how different parts of the UK voted. I think there are ways in which that can be done. </p> <p>I don\u2019t pretend, and I have never since the referendum pretended, that it will be straightforward or without challenges. And maybe we will find that none of these ways are possible, and that independence is the only option for Scotland to pursue. But we will try very hard to put other options on the table.</p> </blockquote> <p>Sturgeon did not give details about what these options might be. But she played down the suggestion that she might want to see a customs border go up between England and Scotland. She said the UK government was opposed to having a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland, and so she did not see the case for erecting one between England and Scotland. She also hinted that Iceland might be a possible model.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There are options - for example the kind of option that Norway has. I was in Iceland at the weekend - [the option] that Iceland has of being in the single market but not in the European Union.</p> <p>Is that as good as full EU membership? In my view, no it\u2019s not. One of the downsides of it is that you have to abide by the rules without influencing the rules - but is it better than being outside the single market completely. Emphatically yes.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>She said she wanted to keep Scotland in the single market.</strong> If it was not in the single market, there would be barriers to trade, she said, and that would be bad for the economy.</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>She said the debate about independence had changed since 2014 because Brexit had changed the balance of economic risk.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The UK we voted to stay part of in 2014 is not the UK we now face the prospect of.</p> </blockquote> <p>Sturgeon said she accepted that the fall in the oil price created difficult questions for those backing Scottish independence. But she went on:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I absolutely accept that if Scotland is in another independence debate then there will be hard economic questions that will be asked that I and those advocating independence have a responsibility to answer.</p> <p>But this debate has changed since 2014. In 2014 those who argued against independence said it was about the economic certainty and stabililty of the UK versus the uncertainty of independence.</p> <p>What we have now in the UK, particularly if it comes out of the single market, is instability and uncertainty and lost economic growth. So this would be a debate about what gives Scotland the best prospect, not of having a magic wand about its economy, but of building the best economic future.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>She said the UK\u2019s budget deficit was likely to get worse because of Brexit.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I think it is very likely that the UK deficit is going to deteriorate because of the economic implications of Brexit.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>She played down the fact that polls indicate a majority of Scots oppose independence.</strong> She said that when the last independence campaign started only 30% of Scots favoured independence, but the yes side eventually got 45% of the vote, she said.</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>She claimed it was \u201cinconceivable\u201d that Westminster would try to stop Scotland holding a second independence referendum if it wanted to have one. </strong>She said she had not heard Theresa May or anyone else in Westminster say they would stop Edinburgh holding a second independence referendum. </li> </ul> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-10-14T12:25:38.772Z\">at 1.25pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-580083a7e4b047a4eaafc5a8\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-14T07:30:56.084Z\">8.30am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>I will post a summary of Sturgeon\u2019s Today interview soon.</p> <p>Here are some of the lines from some of the other interviews she has given this morning.

Her main speech to the conference will take place tomorrow afternoon but, just as Theresa May chose to give two speeches to her party conference, a Brexit one at the start and a domestic policy one at the end, Sturgeon opened the conference yesterday with a speech about Brexit and Scottish independence.</p> <p>Here is the Guardian\u2019s story about it by Severin Carrell.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/13/nicola-sturgeon-challenges-may-with-second-referendum-bill-scottish-independence-snp-conference\">Nicola Sturgeon challenges May with second referendum bill</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And here is how it starts.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Nicola Sturgeon warned that she was prepared to stage a second <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/scottish-independence\">Scottish independence</a> referendum before the UK quits the European Union as she attacked the Tories for their \u201cxenophobic\u201d rhetoric on the EU.</p> <p>In a clear challenge to Theresa May\u2019s government in London, the first minister told the Scottish National party conference in Glasgow she would unveil draft legislation next week to prepare for a rerun of the 2014 referendum within the next two years.</p> <p>Sturgeon said the UK government\u2019s recent rhetoric on capping immigration and on quitting the EU single market made it clear that the Tory party had been taken over by its \u201crampant and xenophobic\u201d right wing.

  "<p>Ten years ago, roughly nine months into our divorce, my ex and I started to build a relationship. The immediate aftermath of our split had been a sour blend of quiet and hurt. We tried to make politeness our default position, and it occasionally held. What kept us connected was our boys, then six and nine. They cut through whatever anger sat between us. We held to that one point of agreement: change the boys\u2019 lives as little as possible. After children have seen their lives inverted, that all sounds a bit feeble, but it was a seed.<br></p> <p>Their mother retained primary custody. The boys lived with her in the only house in New York they had known, a loft in lower Manhattan. Before moving back to my childhood neighborhood in Brooklyn, I spent two years in an apartment close to Ground Zero, then a generally inactive construction site. In 2006, it was just a way to live near the boys\u2019 home and school. The ghosts were quiet and my kids liked the hotel restaurant next to my building.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/oct/13/readers-stories-of-divorce\">'I was totally knocked sideways': readers share their stories of divorce</a> </p> </aside>  <p>When a central home is maintained, and parents cycle through it while the kids stay put, it\u2019s called \u201cbird\u2019s nest custody\u201d or \u201cnesting\u201d. We were improvising, with the help of therapists, and didn\u2019t know what nesting was, even if we mimicked it. We maintained two separate homes, so our arrangement didn\u2019t qualify, though we kept the boys\u2019 concerns central. Our interactions with each other in the first year were the least generous. But a second rule went into effect early: no badmouthing the other parent, whatever the topic. And we were lucky \u2013 we liked and respected each other, beneath the turbulence. That\u2019s where we had started. So the irregular interactions led to a committed decision to not be ugly, even when that seemed impossible. There was enough doubt and hurt for all four of us \u2013 anything to clean the air helped. It was a way of being both selfish and considerate.</p> <p>Even when there wasn\u2019t much of it, talking was a boon. When living together, decisions can be made by default, without negotiation. Sightlines become assumed statements: \u201cThere she goes with the morning drop-off. I guess she\u2019s OK with it.\u201d But when you live in two places, and children aren\u2019t old enough to travel alone, every movement has to be discussed. Who will take whom where and when? Can you take Friday night, because Thursday I need to do something for work? Generosity encouraged reciprocity. The marriage cynic would say: \u201cWell, sure. You had to get along because you can\u2019t engage in the silent warfare of marriages.\u201d But of course you can fight, if one parent doesn\u2019t care about seeing the kids. That wasn\u2019t the case, and a cold war never came. We had no choice but to talk.</p> <p>Whatever else may vex me about cellphones, beginning with my own dependence on them, they allowed a reliable line to my kids. In the past 10 years, we\u2019ve rarely gone a day without talking or texting, even when one of them had a Soviet-style flip phone that could only burp four words a minute. </p> <p>Not everything clicked smoothly into place. Talking involved just as many unpleasant standoffs as reasonable compromises. \u201cYou\u2019re letting them see what? And do what? And miss what school event?\u201d But the distance between households in two different boroughs meant disagreements needed to end quickly. We couldn\u2019t pretend the proximity of a shared house was some simulacrum of \u201cdealing with it\u201d. If we didn\u2019t table a problem, we wouldn\u2019t know how the other parent felt, or what we were supposed to be doing, empirically, minute by minute.</p> <p>Parents make decisions that are as constant as the subjects are varied. They can involve, but are not limited to, middle schools; high schools; unexpected silences from a normally chatty boy; punishments for ambitious, unauthorized parties; whether or not 48 Hours is a comedy; the choice of a party restaurant really far uptown, way the hell away from Brooklyn; and other traditional life events.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/oct/13/divorce-conversation-mother-son\">'What should I have done differently?'

  "<p>Thousands of women who work in Asda stores have won the right to lodge the UK\u2019s largest private sector equal pay claim.</p> <p>An employment tribunal ruled that the women, who work in roles across the shopfloor, can compare their jobs with those done for a higher wage in Asda\u2019s warehouses, predominantly by men. <br></p> <p>If the women win, the retailer could be forced to adjust the pay of many of its 130,000 shopfloor staff, and make back payments to those involved in the case going back to 2002, at an estimated cost of up to \u00a3100m. <br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/sep/27/women-poorly-represented-in-top-1-per-cent-uk-earners-study-finds\">Women poorly represented in top 1% of UK earners, study finds</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Lawyers representing the shopfloor workers said the women typically earned between \u00a31 and \u00a33 an hour less than staff at Asda\u2019s distribution centres.<br></p> <p>The shopfloor workers say they are doing jobs of equal value, but are paid less because their work was historically perceived as \u201cwomen\u2019s work\u201d and therefore thought to be worth less than men\u2019s work. They claim that this historical discrimination has never been corrected by the firm.</p> <p>The Walmart-owned retailer argued the roles could not be compared because they were carried out in different locations. However, the judgment, which followed a Manchester employment tribunal hearing in June, deemed that this was not the case, paving the way for an equal pay case in which judges will examine the value of the jobs being done.</p> <p>About <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/oct/24/asda-mass-legal-action-equal-pay\">9,500 past and current Asda workers</a> from across the UK have signed up with the law firm Leigh Day, which will represent them in the pay claim next year. Lauren Lougheed, a lawyer at Leigh Day, said: \u201cThis is a dramatic victory for the workers we represent. Asda tried to argue that because the shops and distribution centres were in different locations, with different pay arrangements, that Asda could pay the men what they like.</p> <p>\u201cHowever, the employment tribunal found that Asda, the employer of both men and women, could have made sure that there was equal pay between men and women if they wanted to, but chose not to.\u201d<br></p> <p>In a statement, Asda disputed the claims being made against it. \u201cWe believe the demands of the jobs are very different and are considering our options for appeal,\u201d the supermarket said. \u201cAt Asda, hourly paid colleagues doing the same job in the same location are paid the same. Men and women doing the same job in our retail stores are paid the same. Men and women doing the same job in our distribution centres are paid the same. Pay rates in stores differ from pay rates in distribution centres for legitimate reasons, including the different market rates for different jobs in different sectors.\u201d</p> <p>Asda stressed that the decision by the tribunal was on a preliminary issue. \u201cThe tribunal has yet to consider whether the jobs are of equal value in terms of their demands and, if some jobs are, only then will the tribunal move on to consider the reasons for the differentials, including the existence of different market rates in different industry sectors,\u201d it said.</p> <p>At the hearing in June, Asda argued that its distribution and retail sectors were \u201cfundamentally different\u201d and that they operated in different environments and required different skillsets. The judge heard witness statements from five workers with different roles on the shopfloor, including a personal shopper from the Brighton Marina store and a former checkout operator in Wirral. </p> <p>Lougheed said the judgment would have implications for other supermarket equal pay claims, including those Leigh Day is bringing on behalf of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jul/09/sainsburys-faces-equal-pay-battle-with-female-shop-floor-workers\">about 400 Sainsbury\u2019s workers</a>.</p> <p>Chris Cook, the head of the employment department at legal firm SA Law, said the decision was a major milestone but only the first step in a long process. \u201cThis isn\u2019t an isolated case by any means,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll no doubt see major retailers up and down the country facing similar claims around the disparity between the wages of their distribution staff and employees working away on the shopfloor. Even more crucially, employees in any number of sectors will be taking a closer look at their pay packets and how they compare to their colleagues across a business.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Lizzie Deignan may extend her career into 2019 to permit her to race at the world road championships on home turf in Yorkshire, although that will in part depend on whether the chosen course suits her ability.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not out of the question,\u201d she told the Guardian as she prepared to defend her world title on Saturday in Doha. \u201cIt hinges on what they do with the route. The rumour is that it may be flat which would be disappointing.\u201d</p> <p>Deignan, who raced as Lizzie Armitstead before her marriage in September, said the experience of being in Doha for this year\u2019s world championships had prompted her to contemplate continuing until 2019. \u201cThere\u2019s been much discussion about the fact there are no spectators here, and thinking about Yorkshire it will be huge and you begin thinking you\u2019d be mad to miss it.

UKAD, I\u2019m sure, will at some point, maybe, release a statement [recognising that], which would be nice. Obviously the second error was a filing error, not a missed test.

And then the third one I take responsibility for.\u201d That third test was, Deignan repeated, the result of a \u201cfamily crisis\u201d which she was unwilling to explain at the time and was not prepared to comment on this week. \u201cNo, absolutely not, and I never will,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cI never expected it would blow up on such a scale,\u201d Deignan added. \u201cI was taking advice from people who I thought were experts in how to handle it. And, actually, the moment when I trusted my instincts and made my own statement \u2013 I wrote [it] at 3am in my hotel bed prior to flying to Rio \u2013 that was the moment when I felt the most comfortable. When I was able to say what I wanted to say and I wasn\u2019t being guided. But I don\u2019t think there is any right way of handling that.

Republics \u2013 communities that governed themselves \u2013 were the great political ideal of the classical world and the Renaissance. A republic is not necessarily what we would call a democracy, but it does resist tyrants and autocrats. Florence had thrown out the reviled Medici clan \u2013 now the head of the Medici family, <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Clement_VII#/media/File%3APope_Clement_VII.JPG\">Pope Clement VII</a>, made a deal with the Holy Roman Emperor, <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equestrian_Portrait_of_Charles_V#/media/File%3ACarlos_V_en_M%C3%BChlberg%2C_by_Titian%2C_from_Prado_in_Google_Earth.jpg\">Charles V</a>, who agreed to send a huge imperial army to overthrow the Florentine republic.</p> <p>Think Star Wars, but with halberds instead of lightsabres. As the republic got ready to face overwhelming odds, young men paraded up and down the city squares of Florence, drilling, and vowing their readiness to die. Artists, too, joined the fight against the evil empire. The greatest of them all, Michelangelo, was working in the city, sculpting the tombs of the Medici family. He put down his chisel and joined the republic. Appointed Commander of Fortifications, he designed <a href=\"https://lebbeuswoods.wordpress.com/2012/05/22/michelangelos-war/\">menacing gatehouses</a> that were too complex to build in the short time left. So instead \u2013 after running away, then coming back to stand and face death with his fellow citizens \u2013 he created brilliantly designed earthworks. His most ingenious idea was to turn <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:SanMiniatoalMontenew.jpg\">San Miniato</a>, a hill that overlooks Florence, into a gun fort with a lethal commanding view over the countryside.</p> <p>A vast army sent by Charles V arrived expecting to march straight into Florence. Instead it was pinned down by artillery fire from Michelangelo\u2019s gun fort on San Miniato. Michelangelo had saved the Republic \u2013 for now. The imperial army settled in for a siege, and the militant youth of Florence stood on their battlements while food got shorter every day in the city behind them. That is the heroic moment this portrait preserves.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"feaed025b82599e544d422b96ccb1b4a99fce1f4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/feaed025b82599e544d422b96ccb1b4a99fce1f4/0_0_3680_2449/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Michelangelo\u2019s David.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"665\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The eyes have it \u2026 Michelangelo\u2019s David.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo Macleod/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It probably depicts a young arisocrat called Carlo Neroni, and it shows him as a defiant Republican volunteer.

His hand is close to his sword so he can reach for it instantly. </p> <p>Most of all, his sharp eyes glare watchfully at the enemy. This is not just any hard stare. Neroni\u2019s eyes are borrowed from Michelangelo\u2019s David, the statue that stood on Piazza della Signoria as the symbol of Republican vigilance. David has his eyes on Goliath, ready to kill the looming symbol of tyranny. Neroni is ready to fight the Medici and their proxy army: the new Goliath.</p> <p>Pontormo painted at least two moving portraits of young miltants during the siege of Florence. The other is his ravishing <a href=\"http://www.getty.edu/art/collection/objects/824/pontormo-jacopo-carucci-portrait-of-a-halberdier-francesco-guardi-italian-florentine-1528-1530/\">Portrait of a Halberdier</a> in the Getty Museum in LA.

The evil tyrant who sits on a throne ordering murder and torture is based on one of Michelangelo\u2019s <a href=\"http://entertainment.howstuffworks.com/arts/artwork/michelangelo-sculptures18.htm\">Medici tomb sculptures</a>.

  "<p><em>\u201cMuch good has been shown me, and much evil, and the good has never been perfect \u2026\u201d</em><br></p> <p>So says Captain Edward Fairfax Vere at the opening of Britten\u2019s opera Billy Budd \u2013 based on Herman Melville\u2019s <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_Budd\">novella</a> \u2013 set aboard the British navy ship HMS Indomitable during the wars with the French republic at the end of the 18th century. Thereby he sets in motion a drama which, although played out on the large canvas of grand opera, essentially boils down to a psychological and emotional struggle between three characters: the austere and pragmatic Vere, the manipulative, sadistic John Claggart \u2013 master-at-arms aboard ship, and thereby responsible for its policing \u2013 and the orphan lad Billy Budd, an able seaman and heroic talisman for his shipmates, though possessed of an intermittent, disabling stammer.</p> <p>We operatic baritones are often awarded the villainous roles in opera as a foil to our gallant tenor colleagues and I, for one, relish my chances to play the bad guy. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/oct/01/eno-mozart-don-giovanni-review-richard-jones-touches-of-brilliance-and-bdsm\">Don Giovanni</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/jan/25/the-rakes-progress-review\">Nick Shadow,</a> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/oct/20/the-rape-of-lucretia-review\">Tarquinius</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jan/11/royal-opera-house-tosca-gheorghiu-review-an-exceptionally-intelligent-evening\">Baron Scarpia</a>; these are just some of the characters I have portrayed who have allowed me to explore the darker reaches of human nature in the safety of the rehearsal room playground.

Could it be that we are all aware, even while seeking to control our inner demons in our daily interactions with people we meet (in other words, taking our place in polite society), that our internal monologue running just beneath the surface could be released with startling ease \u2013 and, one thinks mischievously, with hilarious results? Welcome to the world of opera.</p> <p>But, as I rehearse for my debut in the role of Billy, how to be good? Or rather, how does one portray an angel without making him, frankly, a bit dull?</p> <p>The director of our new production at Opera North, <a href=\"http://www.orphaphelan.com/\">Orpha Phelan</a>, began the first week of rehearsals with a cast-bonding exercise. She invited us to a movie-night screening of<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6HUdQ1l1C8\"> Peter Ustinov\u2019s 1962 Oscar-winning adaption of the story</a>. Ustinov not only directed and co-wrote the script but also gave a terrific portrayal of Captain Vere. Meanwhile, Billy was played by Terence Stamp in his debut screen role, looking especially youthful and innocent.</p> <p>Although Stamp was an East End lad, he gave Billy a soft, slow, West Country accent, which may have been intended to imply that Billy, though kind and generous, is not overly intelligent \u2013 so much for 1950s regional stereotyping. Billy\u2019s gift instead is a natural, uncanny empathy, drawing out the best qualities in anyone he meets. In a wonderful scene that appears neither in book nor opera, he almost succeeds in drawing Claggart out of his own self-loathing, a feat that would have today\u2019s psychotherapists applauding.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/aug/21/glyndebourne-2013-billy-budd-and-herman-melville-by-ellie-stedall\">Glyndebourne 2013: Billy Budd - 'I was lost on the infinite sea'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It was interesting to watch the film in the company of my predominantly male colleagues. Many of Billy\u2019s simple, homespun utterances were met with a little derision by our modern-day, cynical audience, and I was reminded how difficult it can be to portray pure goodness. We sophisticates nowadays don\u2019t believe in such nonsense.</p> <p>One thing is clear to me: one cannot be content to play a cipher. True, the opera is more an exploration of Captain Vere\u2019s psyche and his wrestle with the repercussions of one, momentous wartime decision. In that light, Claggart and Budd can be seen as opposing sides of his own consciousness. But this doesn\u2019t provide me with much on which to base a character. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"39de358a84673d50048d5688d0d18b3882fe95e7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/39de358a84673d50048d5688d0d18b3882fe95e7/0_119_4357_2614/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Williams as Eugene Onegin, with Natalya Romaniw as Tatyana.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Williams as Eugene Onegin in Garsington Opera\u2019s 2016 production, with Natalya Romaniw as Tatyana.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alice Pennefather/Photo by Mark Douet</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Interestingly, my previous operatic role was the eponymous antihero of <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/23cXkqC2xXC9wXhpmy7Z1qy/watch-eugene-onegin-from-garsington-opera\">Tchaikovsky\u2019s opera Eugene Onegin</a>. Director Sir Michael Boyd stated from the outset that the typical, shorthand view of Onegin as a villain did not wash with him. Instead, we started with the premise that Onegin could just as easily be a good man, but one who has to make some awkward, unfortunate decisions, often in the heat of the moment, the results of which come to haunt him for the rest of his life. That, we thought, was basis of a truer tragedy than the scenario \u201cbored dilettante unceremoniously dumps girl, shoots friend and then endlessly mopes about it\u201d. How can an audience invest in that?</p> <p>And so I realise that the truth of Billy Budd is that he is no angel. It may well be that Vere, years after the event, remembers him as such, but for my purposes Billy is alive on stage as a man, fully rounded and equally capable of destruction and conciliation. \u201cLook out for his temper,\u201d warns Claggart to his hapless informant, Squeak. \u201cLook out for those fists. You\u2019re playing with fire, Squeak. He\u2019ll kill you if he catches you!\u201d In the same way that Billy can understand a man to his very core with one glance, so Claggart can fathom Billy. He recognises something in Billy\u2019s chronic stammer, a seizure that hints at some severe past trauma, an incident of such severe violence that Billy\u2019s nervous system would rather close down than allow the memory a physical expression.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0a3c0ce60c732abb2e19acc19f95e381c3cb6d7f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0a3c0ce60c732abb2e19acc19f95e381c3cb6d7f/58_128_2342_1405/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Roderick Williams with the cast of Billy Budd in rehearsals at Opera North.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Billy\u2019s suppression of violence is most intriguing\u2019 - Roderick Williams with the cast of Billy Budd in rehearsals at Opera North.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Arber</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This suppression of violence is most interesting.

All we are told about his upbringing (in Britten\u2019s opera) is that he was \u201c\u2026 found in a basket tied to a good man\u2019s door, the poor old man\u201d. Who was that man? Did he bring Billy up on his own? How did that work? And why does Billy refer to him as \u201cthe poor old man\u201d? Could it be that, as Billy grew tall and strong, he also grew wild? And wouldn\u2019t his substitute father figure have felt the need to discipline him? How would that relationship have played out in the 18th century? With a rod or a belt, surely. When, within moments of arriving aboard the Indomitable, Billy observes the unfortunate Novice return from a flogging, could this have reminded him of scars in his own history?</p> <p>By this point, I am far into the world of conjecture, I know. However, it is just such conjecture that can help build a full person around a character on the page. It can help give deeper meaning to an odd aside or a throwaway line. It can explain the motivation of an otherwise extraordinary action \u2013 something that might appear out of character, there only to further the plot. For instance, I had not previously reconciled the end of the opera, when Billy transcends his own character and blesses Vere as he ascends to his final hanging. Why this benediction, I have wondered?</p> <p>If Billy has his own debts to pay \u2013 debts that centre around a father figure whom he once rejected, maybe even violently \u2013 then it could explain the speed with which Billy latches on to Captain Vere aboard ship, and his need to \u201clook after\u201d and \u201csave\u201d him once there. Certainly Vere exorcises his demons during the course of this opera. But I would like to imagine that Billy has a chance to exorcise some of his own as well. He can go to the yardarm knowing that he might atone for his own past crimes and find his own peace: \u201cI\u2019ve sighted a sail in the storm, the far-shining sail that\u2019s not fate. And I\u2019m contented. I\u2019ve seen where she\u2019s bound for. She has a land of her own where she\u2019ll anchor for ever.\u201d</p> <ul> <li>Opera North\u2019s new production of Billy Budd opens at <a href=\"https://www.operanorth.co.uk/productions/billy-budd\">Leeds Grand theatre on 18 October, then tours until 3 December</a>.<br></li> </ul>",
  "<p>As the days get shorter, I am reminded of the food we ate as children after coming home from school in the dark. My mother often made meatballs from the mince that was a stalwart of her weekly shop, and I loved to shape them for her. These days, I make larger ones than she did, mainly because it\u2019s quicker. The recipe is simple but incredibly good, packed with herbs and cheese.</p> <p>Eccles cakes are another dish I\u2019m often inspired to make after a trip home. In recent years, both <a href=\"https://www.stjohngroup.uk.com/smithfield/\">St John</a> in London and <a href=\"http://www.pumpstreetbakery.com\">Pump Street Bakery</a> in Orford, Suffolk, have reinvigorated the traditional recipe, making it even more mouth-watering. Do give them a whirl: you\u2019ll be in for a treat.</p> <h2><strong>Giant pork meatballs in tomato sauce</strong></h2> <p>I rinse the sauce off the tomatoes, to get rid of that tinny flavour, but use them just as they are, if you prefer. The shaped meatballs will benefit from 20-30 minutes in the fridge, but don\u2019t worry if you\u2019re pushed for time. Serves four.</p> <p><strong>3 tbsp olive oil</strong><br><strong>3 garlic cloves, peeled and finely sliced</strong><br><strong>3 400g cans plum tomatoes, drained</strong><br><strong>2 bay leaves</strong><br><strong>Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</strong><br><strong>2 tbsp capers, rinsed of brine or salt</strong><br><strong>1-2 pinches brown sugar (optional)</strong></p> <p>For the meatball<br><strong>600g minced pork</strong><br><strong>2 garlic cloves, peeled and finely chopped</strong><br><strong>1 tbsp fresh sage leaves, finely chopped </strong><br><strong>1 tbsp fresh thyme leaves, finely chopped </strong><br><strong>1 small sprig fresh rosemary, leaves picked and finely chopped</strong><br><strong>60g fresh breadcrumbs</strong><br><strong>Zest of 1 lemon</strong><br><strong>1 heaped tbsp Dijon mustard</strong><br><strong>1 egg, beaten</strong><br><strong>1 tbsp olive oil</strong><br><strong>70g grated Parmesan</strong></p> <p>Make the tomato sauce first. Warm the oil in a deep pan on a medium-low heat, then gently fry the garlic just until it begins to colour at the edges. Add the tomatoes, breaking them up with a spoon, then stir in the bay leaves, season generously and leave to simmer gently for 45 minutes. Half an hour into the cooking, add the capers and taste the sauce \u2013 add a pinch or two of brown sugar, if you think it needs it, and a few tablespoons of water if the sauce looks too thick and dry. By the end, it should be thick and silky.</p> <p>While the sauce is cooking, get on with the meatballs. In a bowl, combine all the ingredients except the oil and half the Parmesan, season generously, then mix with your hands until well amalgamated. Heat a little oil in a large frying pan, then saute a teaspoon of the mix until cooked and check it\u2019s seasoned sufficiently. Shape the remaining meatball mix into eight balls then, if you have time, refrigerate them for 20-30 minutes, to firm up.</p> <p>Heat the oven to 200C/390F/gas mark 6. Pour the remaining oil into the frying pan, heat over a medium-high flame, then lightly brown the meatballs on all sides. Transfer to a baking dish just large enough to hold them, pour on the sauce and toss gently to coat. Sprinkle with the remaining cheese and bake for 20 minutes, until firm to the touch.</p> <p>Serve with wide pasta ribbons, perhaps with a rocket and parmesan salad on the side, dressed simply with extra-virgin olive oil and a squeeze of fresh lemon. Or, for a real treat, eat the meatballs on toast.</p> <h2><strong>Apple eccles cakes with apple caramel</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ba658311ec47606f02870802c3a4fd447144daab\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ba658311ec47606f02870802c3a4fd447144daab/0_92_1881_1129/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Thomasina Miers\u2019 apple eccles cakes with apple caramel.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Thomasina Miers\u2019 apple eccles cakes with apple caramel.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Louise Hagger for the Guardian.

Makes about 16.</p> <p><strong>50g very soft butter, plus 1 knob extra</strong><br><strong>100g dark brown muscovado sugar</strong><br><strong>100g currants</strong><br><strong>4 eating apples, cored, peeled and coarsely grated</strong><br><strong>\u00bd tsp freshly ground nutmeg</strong><br><strong>1 tsp freshly ground allspice</strong><br><strong>A few pinches ground cinnamon</strong><br><strong>3 tbsp cider vinegar (or brandy)</strong><br><strong>2 375g blocks ready-made puff pastry, chilled</strong><br><strong>1 egg, beaten</strong><br><strong>40g caster sugar</strong></p> <p>Combine the butter, sugar, currants, apples, spices and vinegar in a bowl, leave to sit for 10 minutes, then strain through a sieve into a saucepan, squeezing out the juices. Add a pinch of salt to the apple mix. </p> <p>Heat the oven to 175C/350F/gas mark 4. Roll out the pastry to about 5mm thick and use a 10cm cookie cutter to cut out as many circles as you can (you should get about eight from each block). Spoon heaped tablespoons of apple mix into the centre of each pastry circle, then bring up the sides of the pastry over the top of the filling and pinch together the edges to seal. Flatten each cake by pressing it down firmly with a palm, turn over so the folds are at the bottom, then slash the top of each cake two or three times and brush all over with beaten egg. Put on a chilled baking tray, then put in the freezer for 30 minutes, to chill.</p> <p>You can now bag them and leave them in the freezer, to be cooked frozen whenever you want (just remove however many you want, brush again with beaten egg and cook as below, allowing a little longer in the oven because they\u2019ll be frozen solid to start with). To cook them straight away, brush with more egg, sprinkle with sugar and bake for 15 minutes, until golden and crisp. Leave the cakes to cool slightly and, while they are resting, simmer the juices for five to 10 minutes, until they\u2019ve reduced to a rich caramel. Stir in the extra knob of butter and serve with the warm cakes.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/oct/07/game-recipes-venison-buns-pigeon-lentil-mushroom-apple-thomasina-miers\">The weekend cook: Thomasina Miers\u2019 game recipes \u2013 steamed venison buns and pigeon with lentils</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>And for the rest of the week\u2026</h2> <p>I often make the meatballs in large batches, but only go as far as browning them before freezing them with their sauce in small bags, all ready to be baked straight from frozen \u2013 it\u2019s a great timesaving meal for the children.

  "<p>\u201cI don\u2019t want this to sound bad but you have to be different, a bit special; half-mad. I talk to a lot of people, ex-team-mates especially \u2013 Roberto Di Matteo, Dan Petrescu, Gianfranco Zola \u2013 and there\u2019s always someone with us who says: \u2018Don\u2019t do it! Don\u2019t coach! What do you need it for? Go to the beach, play golf.\u2019 As a manager, you\u2019re so exposed: every decision, every gesture, every face, every little detail. Everything is so \u2026\u201d</p> <p>Gus Poyet blows out his cheeks and not for the last time: \u201c<em>Tremendo!</em>,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy, it\u2019s really not. Either you have total control of your emotions, or at least know how to manage them, or you can\u2019t do it. It\u2019s endless. The changing emotions in a game, the next day, the day after, and on and on. Look at the heart attacks happening.\u201d</p> <p>Poyet has looked and listened. \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/dec/29/martin-ling-resigns-swindon-town-manager-health-reasons\">Martin Ling, who had an anxiety attack</a>, a breakdown, gave us this incredible talk. He said: \u2018I was like you are\u2019: there was no warning, nothing but one day, it just happened. He stopped the car, called an ambulance, couldn\u2019t breathe. He was out of football for a long time, suffering. He said to us: \u2018It\u2019s so easy to describe \u2026 and so hard to stop.\u2019</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/mar/20/gus-poyet-sunderland-proud-sack\">Gus Poyet proud of Sunderland achievements but disappointed by sacking</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cA player trains all week to reach the high point for the game and then,\u201d Poyet continues, raising his hand and letting it fall. \u201cWhereas we go up, up, up \u2026 and we don\u2019t come down. There\u2019s no drop off, no recovery. After the game: go to the moon. That\u2019s fundamental. I\u2019d love to think that for one day, football\u2019s finished, doesn\u2019t exist. But I can\u2019t.\u201d The sensible thing would be to get out? \u201cTotally, totally but I can\u2019t help it. I like it.\u201d</p> <p>You can tell. There is a reason they nicknamed Poyet \u201cRadio\u201d: always on, always talking, especially when it comes to football. From Leicester to Guardiola to Simeone and Wise; from River Plate \u2013 \u201cthe Uruguayan one\u201d \u2013 to Grenoble, Zaragoza, Brighton and Chelsea. Spurs, too: \u201cDele Alli is going to a big player for a very long time\u201d, he says and \u201cMauricio Pochettino has done something unique: the great thing about Tottenham is that they\u2019ll have seven or eight players at the perfect age in a few years \u2013 still young, but experienced. If he can keep that group, wow, it\u2019ll be spectacular.\u201d</p> <p>As Poyet talks the enthusiasm overflows; so does his speech, quicker and quicker, hands moving as fast, time flying; pulling faces, making gestures, laughing, telling stories, taking a thousand tangents, explaining. Wishing he could explain more, too, imagining himself on the pitch, pre\u2011game, microphone in hand: \u201cLadies and gentlemen of the crowd: today\u2019s tactical decision \u2026\u201d He recalls apologising to his Brighton players: \u201cI cocked it up completely.\u201d He laughs but you can tell it hurt, too.</p> <p>Sure, Poyet admits, there is a lot of crap in football \u2013 infamously, there was even that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/may/18/gus-poyet-fuming-excrement-crystal-palace\">one in the Crystal Palace dressing room</a> \u2013 but there is a lot that is good too and the game has a hold on him. There is a sadness when he admits many players do not even like football: \u201c\u2018Barcelona-Bayern was on last night and you didn\u2019t watch it?\u2019 How can you play a pass if you didn\u2019t even watch that? In Uruguay, every game we play is the last: tomorrow, there\u2019s no more football. It\u2019s over. Today\u2019s the last game ever so you give everything.\u201d Maybe that\u2019s it; although English words occasionally punctuate his speech, the Uruguayan accent is strong and so is the personality. There is something about the way he throws himself into it, a love of the struggle. And, as it turns out, there\u2019s always a tomorrow.</p> <p>Poyet\u2019s career began in France where the chance to join Nice was taken from him so he stayed to play for Grenoble: \u201chorribly,\u201d he says. But there was also the Copa Am\u00e9rica; the cup wins, and the Cup Winners\u2019 Cup wins too, with Real Zaragoza and with Chelsea. He was captain the day Chelsea became the first club to field a team of foreigners and remembers the media, the tunnel, someone warning \u201cwe\u2019d better win\u201d and hurriedly handing the armband back to the next game. He has been sacked as many times as he has been employed as a coach but keeps coming back. Why? <em>Because</em>.</p> <p>So here he is, in Seville: Gus Poyet, manager of Real Betis, preparing for the visit of the European Champions on Saturday. In his office the whiteboard is dotted with tiny magnets: one for each team. This week\u2019s magnet: Real Madrid.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b08cbf20cc72f7609dda77d5b2c8896dde87e74f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b08cbf20cc72f7609dda77d5b2c8896dde87e74f/8_100_3801_2280/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gus Poyet celebrates\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gus Poyet celebrates Sunderland\u2019s last-minute winner against Newcastle in December 2014</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Owen Humphreys/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Poyet has taken a long route here. Having begun his coaching career alongside Wise with Swindon and then Leeds before becoming Juande Ramos\u2019s assistant at Spurs, he arrived in Spain via jobs at Brighton, Sunderland and AEK Athens. In Greece, he lasted four months. At Brighton, he won the League One title and got into the Championship play-offs. At Sunderland, he somehow completed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/mar/20/gus-poyet-sunderland-proud-sack\">a survival he calls \u201cmiraculous\u201d </a>and \u201cincredible\u201d, dragging them out of \u201cintensive care\u201d. It made no difference; all three clubs sacked him.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s something inside Sunderland, something at its very core,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to explain but there\u2019s a way of life, something deep down, that makes it difficult to fulfil its potential. Niall Quinn criticised me for saying so but later talked about \u2018gremlins\u2019; then Paulo Di Canio talked about that moment when you get your head above the parapet and \u2026 bang! There\u2019s something there, something I couldn\u2019t find. If I knew what it was I\u2019d say but I don\u2019t. But it\u2019s there and needs to be changed at the root.</p> <p>\u201cI played at Sunderland with Chelsea. We lost 4-1 and I left thinking: \u2018That was spectacular.\u2019 The passion was explosive. They had Quinn and Kevin Phillips and it was a good moment. Peter Reid was there: an absolute phenomenon but a year later, the same fans were shouting at him from behind the bench. You can\u2019t say that with Quinn and Phillips he\u2019s a good coach and without them he\u2019s not but he went.\u201d</p> <p>Others go, too; the best player\u2019s destiny is to depart. \u201cA player has a good season, and [someone takes him]. It makes no difference if they give you \u00a320m for him \u2013 \u00a320m doesn\u2019t replace him and doesn\u2019t solve anything. The year I arrived they told me Mignolet, Henderson and Rose had been the best; [soon,] Mignolet wasn\u2019t there, Henderson wasn\u2019t there and Rose had returned to Spurs. By January the players giving me exactly what I needed were Keane, Alonso and Borini. All on loan, and they all went.</p> <p>\u201cSo then I go. Dick Advocaat comes in and the blame lies with the last coach and his signings. So you sign new players for the new manager. And then that manager goes and the blame lies with him and his players. So the new manager signs new players. And in comes Sam Allardyce. And then he goes and now David Moyes is there and he has what\u2019s been left him by previous coaches and you can\u2019t go on like that. You just can\u2019t. It\u2019s impossible. Because when you start from zero every year \u2013 every year \u2013 you stay at zero.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/20/barcelona-real-betis-la-liga-match-report\">Luis Su\u00e1rez scores hat-trick in Barcelona\u2019s 6-2 rout of Real Betis</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cYou have to hire a coach and say: \u2018Whatever happens, this is my coach for five years.

That\u2019s football. At Betis, Poyet has Rub\u00e9n Castro, the scorer of 51 league goals over the last two seasons and four this; he talks highly of Joaqu\u00edn, \u201ca player I liked before, and even more now\u201d, someone who doesn\u2019t just play football but \u201creally <em>understands</em> it\u201d; and of the Chelsea loanee Charly Mousonda, he says: \u201cHe has everything to be a special player.\u201d</p> <p>Mousonda, like his Betis team, is a work in progress. \u201cHe just lacks that ability to make the right decisions: that\u2019s what really defines a player. If Charly can make the right decisions at the end of the move \u2026\u201d Poyet puffs his cheeks out again. \u201cHe does everything at 150 mph and it can be difficult to slow down and go, <em>tac</em>.\u201d</p> <p>Poyet\u2019s fondness for Real\u2019s Luka Modric is clear. He is the footballer with the most quality he has worked with but injury means there will be no reunion, leaving only Gareth Bale. \u201cIt\u2019ll be nice to see him,\u201d Poyet says. \u201cHe was a left-back then: Juande Ramos wanted to play him further forward but, inside, Gareth still saw himself as a full-back: he wanted space to run into and starting further forward he wouldn\u2019t get it. It was hard to change his mind. But then came the season when he went to another level. Now that\u2019s where he is \u2013 he feels important, this is his moment, he\u2019s developed a style that includes the responsibility to attack and he doesn\u2019t have to defend as much.

Another reminder of the impact England has had on a man who when he talks about home means London. The assistant\u2019s name is Anthony Philip David Terry Frank Donald Stanley Gerry Gordon Stephen James Oatway. \u201cYeah, and they call him Charlie!\u201d Poyet bursts out laughing.</p> <p>Charlie Oatway, who finished his playing career at Havant and Waterlooville, is named after the QPR team who won promotion in 1973. If Poyet was to do the same, his son would be called Andoni Alberto Fernando Xavi Jes\u00fas Santi Mohammed Gustavo Francisco Miguel Juan Poyet. Luckily for Diego Poyet, his father\u2019s memories of his Zaragoza\u2019s Cup-Winner\u2019s Cup winning team and of Nayim lobbing David Seaman from 40 yards, were not written across a birth certificate.</p> <p>Recently released by West Ham, an England Under-17 international who switched to Uruguay at under-20 level, Diego, like his father, is a midfielder: just the kind Real Madrid could do with, in fact.</p> <p>They will be without the injured Casemiro and Poyet admits that makes them \u201canother team\u201d. \u201cPeople said Zinedine Zidane was good four months ago and now he\u2019s bad. No, four months ago he found the solution: Casemiro. Now, he doesn\u2019t have that solution. He hasn\u2019t got another player like him, either.\u201d</p> <p>So much the better. Yet it is not as if Real do not concern him. There is work to do still in Seville . The answer for Charlie is a little after nine: preparation continues right up until that moment just before kick-off, when Betis\u2019s manager will deliver one last message.

Did they mis-speak, were they misinterpreted \u2013 or was this indeed a premature outing of something that was then rapidly withdrawn?</p> <p>Sadly, it\u2019s unlikely we\u2019ll ever know.

All &quot;literature&quot; was originally oral. For example The Odyssey, Beowulf and The Mahabharata were sung to illiterate audiences by bards with highly trained memories....writing wasn\u2019t invented until 3000 BC. Dylan's had an impact on contemporary culture at least as great as Homer, I reckon. The effect is most obvious among other songwriters. But he has left an indelible mark on even the highest brow forms of art which is so pervasive that we can't see it clearly any longer. From my own limited reading I would argue Salman Rushdie, Thomas Pynchon, E. Annie Proulx, Martin Amis, David Foster Wallace and Cormac McCarthy all bear his stamp - just as the sponge-like Dylan has received and transmitted things from them. Someone today said imagine a gathering of survivors after McCarty's nuclear holocaust where all paper and electronic devices had gone up in smoke - they suggested people would find it easier to reconstruct Dylan songs from their memories than the output any star of contemporary &quot;literary&quot; London!</p></div> </div> </div>  </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-10-14T15:17:56.569Z\">at 4.17pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5800a6dae4b047a4eaafc5e8\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/tobymoses\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-14T14:05:54.466Z\">3.05pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">An extract from Mariella Frostrup: put down the porn and explore real sex with erotica!</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><em>This week I commissioned an article from UK-based journalist and television presenter Mariella Frostrup on the resurgence of erotic writing. Here\u2019s an extract from her piece:</em></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Erotica is so different from pornography, which is almost exclusively designed to cater to men. Any relationship that existed between men and erotica dates back to the Victorian era when it was one of the few ways to access the sexy stuff. Now the tsunami of pornography has all but obliterated any particular interest the majority of men might have had in reading erotica. For women, sex is part of a whole sensory experience and I think that is less true of men. If you look at the pornography that has been designed to appeal to male viewers, particularly in the 21st century, it is very much about the physical act and very little else. That is why it is less satisfying for a lot of women.</p> <p>There\u2019s a huge difference between the perfunctory plots sometimes used in pornography and the experience of immersing yourself in a story, characters and a considered environment \u2013 all those elements of the intellectual exchange involved in reading. In pornography, the literal act is simply placed right before your eyes. It is skin deep and, increasingly in the modern world, what you\u2019re watching is the poor, dispossessed and desperate trying to earn a crust in whatever way they can. How many people who participate in porn do so because that\u2019s what they grew up wanting to do? The sex industry as a whole is a bit like the drug industry. It\u2019s an end product that involves an awful lot of misery for an awful lot of people along the way.</p> </blockquote> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/13/porn-sex-erotica-erotic-writing\">Put down the porn and explore real sex with erotica | Mariella Frostrup</a> </p> </aside>  <p>What do you think?

It would have been a disservice not just to our readers but to democracy itself to silence their voices. We did what the law allows: We published newsworthy information about a subject of deep public concern.

  "<h2>HELLO OLD FRIEND<br></h2> <p>The Fiver has simple dreams. We do not ask for much in life. A roof over our head, a pile of rags in the corner to sleep in, and a steady supply of Tin to block out the worst of the darkness. Sometimes, if we\u2019re lucky, we\u2019ll find a half-eaten sandwich in a skip for sustenance, before realising it\u2019s not in fact a skip but rather a pop-up pulled pork emporium, and a hipster wearing half a hat and an ironic Mel and Kim T-shirt holding out his tattooed hand and asking for \u00a313.50.</p> <p>Another of the simple things in life we ask for is, for a couple of days at least, to be free from the dull fridge-buzz that is discussion of England, Wayne Rooney, or England and Wayne Rooney. And because it loves us, because it loves all of us, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/oct/14/premier-league-10-things-to-look-out-for-this-weekend\">the Premier League is here to help us out</a>. For the interminable grind of international football is gone (for a bit) and the interminable grind of domestic football is here again. So what have we got in store? Well, for a start, Claudio Ranieri will briefly pause being a football manager and become a walking art exhibit, the theme being \u2018Living Well Is The Best Revenge\u2019, as he returns to Stamford Bridge as Premier League champion, contented and happy. Meanwhile, his old employers Chelsea wrestle with their confused identity, and the horrible sensation of not being able to cope without Plain Old John Terry, 76, despite their desperation to cast aside this crutch but being unable to, like Tony Soprano and Dr Melfi. Elsewhere in London Bob Bradley, a man with a stare that could slice through kevlar, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/14/swansea-city-bob-bradley-premier-league-first-american-arsenal\">takes charge of his first Swansea game</a>, at Arsenal. Under normal circumstances this would have a 2-0 home win (S\u00e1nchez 76, Giroud 89) written all over it but, when the Swans\u2019 new manager is someone who looks like he could knock out a bear if he wanted, anything is possible.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/oct/14/premier-league-10-things-to-look-out-for-this-weekend\">Premier League: 10 things to look out for this weekend</a> </p> </aside>  <p>We also have Manchester City v Everton, less a football match and more an ideal opportunity for Ronald Koeman to take Pep Guardiola aside and ask him for the digits of Barcelona\u2019s decision-makers and, if not, to pass them on a message. Nothing fancy, just \u201cRonald says hi, and have you changed your phone number by the way because I\u2019m having trouble getting hold of you?\u201d Then in Stoke there\u2019s the Ennui Derby, as Sunderland come to town, where both David Moyes and Ailsa from Home and Away can swap stories about being canned by either side of Manchester, just to take their minds of things really. Tottenham play West Brom for the first time since <em>that</em><strong> </strong>second half at the back end of last season, when the bottom abruptly dropped out of their season and the wheels flamboyantly came off. Presumably Mauricio Pochettino\u2019s main concern is that his players have got over their PTSD from that one. And then there\u2019s Crystal Palace v West Ham, where Handsome Pards will dance around his vanquished opponent before belatedly remembering there might be a job going at the FA soon, and he could do with maintaining some dignity. Still, when you\u2019re the king, you can do what you want.</p> <p>Last but almost certainly least, Mike Phelan, bless him, has finally been told he can take his coat off and stay at Hull, safe in the knowledge that he was definitely the club\u2019s first choice and they absolutely weren\u2019t just making doubly sure they couldn\u2019t get anyone better in. He\u2019ll celebrate with a trip to the south coast, where Bournemouth will be waiting. So there we go. That should keep the darkness at bay for a couple of days. Until Monday when everyone starts talking about Rooney again. Oh god.</p> <h2>BREAKING NEWS</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/14/footballer-ched-evans-cleared-of-in-retrial\">Ched Evans has been found not guilty</a> at his retrial of raping a 19-year-old waitress in a hotel room after a drunken night out with former club-mates. Evans spent two and a half years in prison for rape but his original conviction was quashed by the appeal court following a high-profile and well-funded campaign by family and friends that included the offer of a \u00a350,000 reward for information leading to his acquittal. In a statement read outside the court by his solicitor, Evans said he was \u201coverwhelmed with relief\u201d following the verdict. He thanked his friends and family, \u201cmost notably my fiancee, Natasha, who chose, perhaps incredibly, to support me in my darkest hour\u201d. Evans stood by his lawyer shaking as the statement concluded: \u201cWhile my innocence has now been established, I wish to make it clear that I wholeheartedly apologise to anyone who might have been affected by the events of the night in question.\u201d</p> <p>The appeal was allowed after judges gave the go-ahead for two former sexual partners of the alleged victim to give explicit evidence in court about her sex life, a rare move that is being widely condemned by women\u2019s support groups and campaigners. One group, Women Against Rape (WAR), told the Guardian the decision \u201cdrove a coach and horses\u201d through legislation designed to protect victims and could <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/oct/14/campaigners-fear-evans-case-will-stop-women-reporting\">stop other abused women coming forward</a> for fear they would be quizzed about their sex lives.</p> <h2>QUOTE OF THE DAY</h2> <p>\u201cForty-eight hours between two games \u2013 how does this work?

Simply expand the World Cup finals to all 209 eligible national teams so it\u2019s really super-inclusive but remove the boring old qualification phase. The catch is that you might need to extend the tournament window from four weeks to probably around two or three years, and possibly play the tournament games on a more global basis. Although, here\u2019s a thought, to make it extra special you take the final 32 teams and make them play in a host country for a short period. In practice this bit might need more thought\u201d \u2013 James Nott.</p> <p>\u201cFar be it from me to defend the new-again manager of Derby County, but Steve McClaren didn\u2019t really drive their form over a cliff, Thelma and Louise-style (yesterday\u2019s Fiver), last time he was there. In his first season he got them to the play-off final, where they should really have beaten QPR, and the next season they missed out on the play-offs in the last match of the season (admittedly having had a less-than-perfect run-in) after which he was invited to calculate the square root of one, then do it. Mind you, if his second-coming at FC Twente is anything to go by, the same calculation is likely to be called for by the end of this season.

Obama might have picked ET \u2013 just as heart-warming but far more timeless (as the success of Netflix\u2019s Stranger Things proved recently) \u2013 instead.

Both rose from humble beginnings in provincial backwaters (though Tatooine does not look a whole lot like Hawaii) to become the great hope of their respective organisations. Both also built up a habit of winning, though despite what certain rightwing syndicated radio hosts might privately believe, only one is capable of sinister mind control.</p> <h2>Star Trek The Original Series <strong>(1966-69)</strong></h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8bY619HLQc\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/k8bY619HLQc?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Another fruit of Apollo-era optimism, Gene Roddenberry\u2019s space saga was chosen by Obama because it \u201cwasn\u2019t actually about technology.

And after several periods during his eight years in office when the president\u2019s political ambitions were stymied by the glacial pace of government machinery, he will no doubt have found himself nodding approvingly at the stolid heroism of a man who (despite being left for dead millions of miles from the nearest human being) simply knuckled down and got on with the job.</p> <h2>The Matrix (<strong>Lana and Lilly </strong>Wachowski, 1999) </h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKQi3bBA1y8\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/vKQi3bBA1y8?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>A topical one, this, with the concept that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/oct/11/simulated-world-elon-musk-the-matrix\">we might all be living in an incredibly complex simulation</a> finding genuine traction in some corners of the scientific community.

  "<p>One of the most extraordinary features of the Ched Evans case was the manner in which the complainant was abused on social media and her identity revealed.</p> <p>By the time Evans was jailed in April 2012 she had been named thousands of times. The woman was forced to relocate from her hometown of Rhyl and change her identity but even during the retrial this month, she continued to be named and abused. </p> <p>In November 2012 nine people <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/nov/05/ched-evans-rape-naming-woman\">pleaded guilty at Prestatyn magistrates court in north Wales</a> to publishing material likely to lead members of the public to identify the complainant in a rape case, contrary to the Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act, 1992. </p> <p>Six were from north Wales, including Ched Evans\u2019s cousin Gemma Thomas, three from Sheffield, where Evans played (for United). One tweeted: \u201cShe is to blame for her own downfall. Lets find her address.\u201d</p> <p>The nine claimed they were not aware naming the woman was a criminal offence and were ordered to pay \u00a3624 compensation each. </p> <p>At a Welsh Women\u2019s Aid violence against women conference, <a href=\"http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/ched-evans-rape-victim-relocated-2013409\">police said a \u201crelocation package\u201d was put together</a> after the abuse she received. </p> <p>The conference discussed whether the existing legislation aimed at preventing \u201cconventional\u201d media from divulging the complainant\u2019s name was now out of date and was difficult to apply to social media.</p> <p>Little appears to have changed. The naming and abuse continues. </p> <p>After the jury had been sworn in for Evans\u2019s retrial in Cardiff, the judge, Mrs Justice Nicola Davies, was furious that a blog had identified the complainant and made \u2013 in the words of the prosecution \u2013 \u201coutrageous assertions\u201d about the case. The prosecution called it a \u201cflagrant\u201d breach of the law and raised the possibility that the trial would have to be abandoned. </p> <p>The blog was referred to the attorney general\u2019s office. The solicitor general, Robert Buckland QC, has referred it to the police for a criminal investigation to take place.</p> <p>But postings continued. An Ireland-based blogger, Ciaran J Goggins, was among those who carried on commenting on the case \u2013 and the complainant \u2013 during the trial.</p> <p>Another social media storm is bound to follow the trial. Many will, no doubt, criticise Evans. But it is likely the most hostile messages will be aimed at the complainant. She has been warned by police to expect another onslaught.</p>",

But in the retrial that ended on Friday, the jury concluded differently: Evans was found not guilty in a case in which consent remained the central issue. </p> <p>Following his initial conviction four years ago, Evans has fought to prove he was wronged ever since. When he lost his appeal later that year, supporters of Evans, including his partner\u2019s millionaire parents, hired private detectives, put up a \u00a350,000 reward for information, and went to the Criminal Cases Review Commission \u2013 which for no publicly explained reason fast-tracked the case and brought it back to the court of appeal.</p> <p>Here Evans\u2019s lawyers produced two men \u2013 both known to the footballer\u2019s circle \u2013 who said they had slept with the young woman in the weeks before and after the incident with him at the Premier Inn in Rhyl. They testified variously that she was sexually brazen, had demanded to be \u201cfucked harder\u201d, and assumed the same sexual position with them both.</p> <p>These happened to be the same words and sexual positions that Evans had told police the woman had taken up during sex with him at a hotel room in the early hours of 30 May 2011. His account of what he said took place had been freely available on the internet \u2013 something the appeal court knew.</p> <p>According to Vera Baird QC, in the past many defendants in rape trials called in their mates to testify to the woman\u2019s promiscuity to undermine her credibility.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/oct/14/campaigners-fear-evans-case-will-stop-women-reporting\">Campaigners fear Evans case will stop women reporting rape</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It was Baird who helped draft the restrictions intended to stop that abuse of the criminal process: section 41 of the 1999 Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Act was introduced to combat the twin myths liberally smeared on female rape complainants in the criminal process, effectively putting the complainant on trial \u2013 the myths that promiscuous women are more likely to consent to sex and less worthy of being believed.</p> <p>But the appeal court judges, exploiting the one exception in the legislation, said the accounts of sexual behaviour in the Evans case were so similar they could not reasonably be explained as coincidence. They quashed his conviction and ordered a retrial, and the evidence of the two men was heard in front of a jury for the first time.</p> <p>So for the past fortnight, the young woman, who has had to move house because of the social media campaign against her, has been subjected to the kind of criminal dissection of her morality and sexual behaviour campaigners hoped were long gone.</p> <p>Whether she said words to the effect of \u201cfuck me harder\u201d during sex with two other men was a key part of the trial.</p> <p>The court heard two independent witnesses who testified the girl was very drunk, had glazed eyes and was incoherent and stumbling on the night she encountered Evans. The law states that in order to give consent a woman, or a man for that matter, must have freedom and capacity to consent. For those who are not clear, that means <em>not</em> being under the severe influence of alcohol. But the jury, having heard the evidence in court, clearly were not convinced.<br></p> <p>Last year, the director of public prosecutions, Alison Saunders, decided to tackle the stubborn prevalence of the kind of rape myths that were around in the 1980s \u2013 myths that social media seems to have amplified.</p> <p>\u201cCapacity means that someone who is under severe influence of drink or drugs \u2026 or who is asleep, may not be able to consent to sex,\u201d she wrote, adding, \u201cBeing drunk can make someone vulnerable, it doesn\u2019t mean they were \u2018up for it\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>There has long been concern that lawyers have tried to undermine the protections given to rape complainants in section 41, including by slipping past sexual behaviour into evidence via medical reports. </p> <p>Many fear the events in Cardiff crown court will mean more women are subjected to the kind of humiliating, intrusive and misogynistic dissection of their sexual behaviour that should have been consigned to history.</p>",
  "<p>The unwanted declaration of love. The friend who decides to honestly reveal what they always thought of&#xa0;your baby\u2019s nose. Sometimes it only takes&#xa0;one line to kill a&#xa0;relationship. For some&#xa0;reason, the publisher of <em>Private Citizens</em> invites us on the flyleaf to \u201cCall&#xa0;it \u2026 <em>Middlemarch</em> for millennials\u201d. And what could have been a pleasant encounter between reader and slab of near-contemporary realism is suddenly dead, murdered by incompatible expectations. Every page of this debut is haunted by the unflattering question: \u201cIs this what a <em>Middlemarch</em> for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/series/millennials-the-trials-of-generation-y\" title=\"\">millennials</a> would do?\u201d</p> <p>In the pro column: it\u2019s on the long side, with liberal use of free indirect discourse, some philosophical digressions, and erudite quotes to head up each chapter (one of which is taken from <em>Middlemarch</em>, suggesting that the&#xa0;comparison has not been imposed unbidden). It\u2019s also set around a critical moment in technology from recent history, with the burgeoning internet of 2007-8 in place of the railways bearing down on <em>Middlemarch</em>. In the con column: this is not a study of life in&#xa0;a provincial town, because it\u2019s set in San&#xa0;Francisco; and it doesn\u2019t have the roaming, rangy sympathies of Eliot. Where <em>Middlemarch</em> achieved understanding for even its most flawed characters, no one in <em>Private Citizens</em> rises above the level of detestable.</p> <p>All four core members of the central ensemble, in fact, make faking your own death feel like a preferable alternative to hanging out. Thrown together at Stanford and now negotiating adulthood, they are: Will, an Asian-American web 2.0 wunderkind stricken by racism and his own pathetic worship of hot women; Cory, Jewish, a do\u2011gooder and self-destroyer working at a non-profit; Henrik, a heavily medicated perma-student with an unworldly bent. And then there\u2019s Linda, the manic pixie dreamgirl who knows she\u2019s a manic pixie dreamgirl, because she\u2019s a painfully self-aware writer \u2013 or at least she would be a&#xa0;writer if she weren\u2019t so busy ministering to her internalised misogyny with drugs and booze and&#xa0;sex.</p> <p>Linda\u2019s is the first voice we hear in the novel, and it\u2019s through her that Tulathimutte does most of the heavy thinking. There are no grand digressions by the narrator in the manner of&#xa0;<em>Middlemarch</em>\u2019s great pier-glass passage, because as Tulathimutte has&#xa0;Linda say: \u201cContemporary authors were so shit-scared of moralising that they delegated to their poor characters the responsibility for conveying their&#xa0;philosophies through indirect discourse.\u201d Later on, belatedly discovering <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/wire\" title=\"\"><em>The Wire</em></a>, Linda reflects on&#xa0;the way evolving media is eroding fiction\u2019s province: the prestige HBO drama has \u201ckilled the social novel, that&#xa0;sad oxymoron\u201d, she thinks. \u201cThen&#xa0;you go online and read the public affirmations of the First World. At last the mass can sing of the mass. What writing can survive? The inverse in verse, the antisocial novel?\u201d</p> <p>Given that she has these weighty platitudes to mouth, it\u2019s hard not to sympathise with Linda when she says: \u201cI have real pity for fictional characters, the clueless dupes of dramatic irony \u2013 especially the female creations of male novelists.\u201d But it\u2019s also very hard to enjoy such limited observations from such a limited character. It\u2019s all very well to recognise that fictions are subordinated to their authors, and that&#xa0;the intricate triple-decker might be redundant in the age of lifecasting (one of the typically 2000s things that <em>Private Citizens</em>\u2019 characters get involved in), but describing the limits of your work does not automatically make it&#xa0;more insightful or interesting.</p> <p>Maybe if Tulathimutte had allowed himself to play the classic realist narrator, his characters could have enjoyed a little more space to act. Instead, they are cramped and inert. Very little happens to or is done by them for most of the book, and the flimsy threads of plot run alongside each other rather than intersecting \u2013 Linda might complain that San Francisco is \u201ctoo small to churn away&#xa0;consequence\u201d, but that\u2019s not the&#xa0;impression given by the parallel lives of her and her friends. There\u2019s incident, but not much import.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In the absence of complex characters, Private Citizens is less Middlemarch and more I Love the 00s</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>What results is a time capsule rather&#xa0;than a novel. <em>Private Citizens </em>repeatedly spins you out of the fiction to check when smartphones became ubiquitous, or at what time the word \u201ccishet\u201d might plausibly have appeared in the vocabulary of the right-on, or when describing oneself as a \u201cronin\u201d or&#xa0;\u201cninja\u201d became a tedious habit in the creative industries. Tulathimutte reliably gets these details right, but details are all they are. They signify little more than nostalgia.

  "<p>One thing about Bob Dylan: he can write a song about pretty much anything, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/oct/13/bob-dylan-deserves-to-win-nobel-prize-literature\">and make it fairly good</a>. Even an Eskimo called <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c79zv5XG5Dw\">Quinn</a>. But not all songwriters have his talents. And yet so many of them continue to believe they have a golden touch that enables them to write about any subject under the sun with equal facility. There are certain subjects that reveal songwriting shortcomings. Generally, they tend to come when the songwriter feels the need to stretch out a bit, to reveal their hidden depths, by dealing with Big Issues. All too often, sadly, they simply reveal their hidden shallows. </p> <p>The list below is a guide to some of the subjects that might best be avoided (there are others, such as The Mystical Power of the Native American, My Trip to Africa, My Trip to Asia, Why People Who Commute to Office Jobs Are Deluded Sheep, Why Monogamy Cannot Contain My Passion, but we\u2019ll let them pass). That\u2019s not to say there are no good songs about these subjects: there are, and there are some great ones. But they are outweighed by the catalogue of horrors. Please feel free to add your own unfit subjects for song to the list.</p> <h2>1. Your record label\u2019s inadequacies</h2> <p><strong>Why?</strong> It\u2019s office politics. How often do you like hearing, in conversation with someone you don\u2019t know, about what so-and-so\u2019s manager did the other day, and how it completely ignored the planned campaign roll-out, and left the teller in a right nark? </p> <p><strong>Exhibit:</strong> Let\u2019s get this one out of the way, because a load of you are going to claim this is one of the best songs ever written: you\u2019re wrong. The Clash were meant to be a revolutionary force, guerillas with guitars, preaching the truth to The Kids. Their third single, Complete Control, opened with the lines: \u201cThey said, release Remote Control / But we didn\u2019t want it on the label.\u201d It continues with a complaint about the size of their guest lists on tour, then berates CBS for wanting to make money. Chaps, if you didn\u2019t want the demands a major label brings, you shouldn\u2019t have signed with one. And you didn\u2019t have to stay there the rest of your career, while you did such dictated-by-the-man things as release a triple album named after Nicaraguan revolutionaries.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JeTw_p_WglY\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/JeTw_p_WglY?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <h2>2. Old men who communicate their wisdom to you</h2> <p><strong>Why?</strong> Is it a passing of the flame? When our young buck encounters a old man \u2013 and it\u2019s almost always a man \u2013 how come said man is always wise, rather than a cantankerous fella demanding a seat on the bus? The tone, generally, is that of Uriah Heap\u2019s Wise Man: \u201cI sat before the wise man / In the autumn of my youth.\u201d And the wise man usually conveys that there is still so much to learn. It\u2019s boastful \u2013 look at my humility! \u2013 and sanctimonious.</p> <p><strong>Exhibit:</strong> Forever Changes by Love is one of my favourite albums. It\u2019s almost perfect. And then it has Old Man. A song about \u2013 yes \u2013 an old man, who\u2019d been everywhere in the world. He\u2019d seen almost everything, too. And can you guess what kind of advice he gave? Yes, it was good. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbzmX0BDpC4\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/MbzmX0BDpC4?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <h2>3. Povertysplaining</h2> <p><strong>Why</strong><strong>?</strong> You are almost certainly richer than your listeners. They almost certainly encounter poverty more often than you, which is perhaps why you find it so shocking. They don\u2019t need you to tell them what poor people look like.</p> <p><strong>Exhibit:</strong> Phil Collins has been unfairly criticised for many things, but Another Day in Paradise is not one of them. Criticism of that is manifestly fair. First, because literally everyone who has ever been to a city is aware of the problem of homelessness. Second, because he equates his material wealth with his listener\u2019s by pointing out that both \u201cyou and me\u201d are in paradise. Third, because he actually uses the phrase \u201cthink about it\u201d. Praise be that he didn\u2019t add a \u201cyeah?\u201d on the end.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qt2mbGP6vFI\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Qt2mbGP6vFI?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <h2>4. Your children</h2> <p><strong>Why?</strong> You\u2019ve had children? Great. We\u2019re happy for you. You love your child? Of course \u2013 but shouldn\u2019t we take that for granted? There\u2019s really no need to tell us, verse after endless verse.</p> <p><strong>Exhibit</strong>: Alicia Keys is at a brand new stage in her life, with a brand new feeling, after giving birth to her son. \u201cThere ain\u2019t no man or prize / Oh no, can compare to you.\u201d A child is more valuable than a Grammy. Good to know.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSHw9IWx9qA\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/LSHw9IWx9qA?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <h2>5. Other people\u2019s children</h2> <p><strong>Why?</strong> Do we really have to explain this one? </p> <p><strong>Exhibit:</strong> \u201cI can see that you\u2019re 15 years old,\u201d sang Mick Jagger on the Rolling Stones\u2019 Stray Cat Blues. \u201cYou say you got a friend, that\u2019s she\u2019s wilder than you / Why don\u2019t you bring her upstairs / If she\u2019s so wild then she can join in, too.\u201d That\u2019s not sex, Mick, it\u2019s sexual assault. They make her 16 years old when they play it now. That\u2019s all right then.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsBiKga7Z_8\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/HsBiKga7Z_8?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <h2>6. Life on the road</h2> <p><strong>Why?</strong> Second and third albums are replete with weary anthems about how hard it is playing 250 shows a year. And I\u2019m sure it is: most normal people would start going slightly bonkers cooped up with the same people 24 hours a day for months on end, with just the hour on stage to release the tension. But the reason you don\u2019t need to tell us about it is that every other band ever has already done so. You could spend 250 nights a year just listening to songs about life on the road, so spare us another one.</p> <p><strong>Exhibit:</strong> The saccharine ballad Beth by Kiss, sung by drummer Peter Criss, was an inexplicably huge breakthrough hit for the US glam rock band. Thing is, Beth, Peter can\u2019t come home right now, \u201cBecause me and the boys are playing / And we just can\u2019t find the sound.\u201d There are plenty who would say that second line remains true, 40 years on.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEoxhclFRZk\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/yEoxhclFRZk?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <h2>7. Animals. Especially endangered animals</h2> <p><strong>Why?</strong> It\u2019s the even cutesier version of songs about your children. With added sanctimony, when said animals are endangered and you are pleading for their survival. And the animals are always either sweet, threatening or charismatic megafauna. Rarely do boring, functional animals get a look in.</p> <p><strong>Exhibit:</strong> How about Damon Albarn\u2019s story of an elephant \u201cwith only this song to tell you how he feels\u201d?</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODG3VRkncBc\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ODG3VRkncBc?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <h2>8. Why we could only have peace in strife-torn areas, if only we realised we\u2019re all the same under the skin, yeah?</h2> <p><strong>Why?</strong> When a musician successfully negotiates a peace treaty, we\u2019ll remove this one from the list. Until then, your ability to analyse geopolitical conflicts in 200 words will remain in doubt.</p> <p><strong>Exhibit:</strong> Plenty of low-hanging fruit here, and I\u2019m not above going for the obvious. So come on down, the Cranberries: \u201cWith their tanks and their bombs / And their bombs and their guns / In your head, in your head they are dying.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ejga4kJUts\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6Ejga4kJUts?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <h2>9. Your tax bill</h2> <p><strong>Why? </strong>You have to pay taxes? What, you? With your indescribable talent? Why, that\u2019s a disgrace. No one should place that burden on you. You should leave it to we little people to do that. </p> <p><strong>Exhibit:</strong> I thought about Johnny Cash\u2019s After Taxes \u2013 written by Billy Wheeler and Jerry Leiber \u2013 but there\u2019s a fighting chance that one\u2019s written from the perspective of the working stiff. Which brings us back, inevitably, to the song the Beatles should really have found an alternate lyric for. Rarely has the contrast between brilliant music and awful lyric been as grotesque as on Taxman.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsO_slTTEr4\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/bsO_slTTEr4?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <h2>10. Your reviews</h2> <p><strong>Why?</strong> Like songs about your label, it\u2019s a subset of songs about office politics, though it\u2019s also a subset of the horrifically unappealing genre \u2013 too big to cover here, frankly \u2013 of songs about How Misunderstood I Am. But there\u2019s something almost equally unappealing about songs complaining about your reviews: if this is the biggest thing you have to worry about, let\u2019s swap problems. Right, I\u2019ve got to go and write 1,200 words about the most horrible comments about my articles.</p> <p><strong>Exhibit:</strong> \u201cMr Writer,\u201d suggested Kelly Jones of Stereophonics, \u201cwhy don\u2019t you tell it like it is?\u201d Which rather ignored the possibility that telling it like it is was precisely what the writer had done.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwOMnIuAGOY\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/IwOMnIuAGOY?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>",

  "<p>The funniest thing about Miranda Sings, the YouTube personality created by comedian and singer Colleen Ballinger, is that by skewering the tone-deaf masses trying to get famous singing cover songs in their bedrooms and posting them on YouTube, she eventually racked up seven million subscribers all on her own. But could a shtick so dependent upon and steeped in the world of the video-sharing platform survive when taken off of it? Based on Haters Back Off, Netflix\u2019s eight-episode Miranda Sings series, it not only survives, but it also thrives. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/oct/14/haters-back-off-miranda-sings-colleen-ballinger-the-queen-of-youtube-trolling\">Haters back off! Meet Colleen Ballinger, the queen of YouTube trolling</a> </p> </aside>  <p>With her unique pronunciation, enormous red lipstick that looks like a baboon\u2019s backside, and a preternatural belief in herself, Miranda has always been a unique and awkward character. When reading over her YouTube comments on camera she regularly misinterprets compliments as attacks and attacks as the praise she sees as her God-given right to have lavished upon her. What Haters Back Off does is allow us to see not just Miranda and how she behaves while vlogging but the unique circumstances that created her and abet her totally misplaced entitlement. </p> <p> Miranda is homeschooled by her blindly supportive but timid mother Bethany (Angela Kinsey), a grocery store clerk who wears a wrist brace for her \u201cundiagnosed fibromyalgia\u201d, in Tacoma, Washington. Her Uncle Jim (Steve Little) is not only her manager but also her No 1 fan, giving her a five-point path to stardom that doesn\u2019t end with an EGOT as her pinnacle but working as a magician. The only normal one in the family is Emily (Francesca Reale), who pays the electric bill, tells her self-absorbed family how to behave in public, and has the mercy to inform her sister how little talent she actually has. </p> <p>The comedy comes not only from Miranda\u2019s delightfully awful performances (a slapstick rendition of All That Jazz at a Seattle gay bar karaoke contest is a series standout) but how Miranda treats each indignity as a triumph and each tiny triumph \u2013 like winning that karaoke contest \u2013 as an insult. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDDAClMibkM\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/bDDAClMibkM?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Sometimes her witlessness can be grating, creating situations that aren\u2019t necessarily funny but just appalling, like when she takes over the church choir to get close to the comely guitar player who literally can\u2019t remember her name. However, it\u2019s the same formula that is successful for Larry David in Curb Your Enthusiasm, Ricky Gervais in The Office, and now Zach Galifianakis in Baskets. Maybe we\u2019re just not that used to a woman \u2013 especially one who reads as a teenager \u2013 striking it rich in the same comedy goldmine. </p> <p> That\u2019s what reminded me so much of The Comeback, Lisa Kudrow and Michael Patrick King\u2019s dearly departed and under-appreciated HBO comedy about a fading sitcom actress trying to restart her career with a reality television show. Not only do they both have self-centered, well-meaning, and often misunderstood women at the center of them but at their best, they are both an indictment of our society\u2019s quest for fame and the ways that can warp all the people hunting for it.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/oct/11/american-housewife-review-abc-family-sitcom-fails\">American Housewife review \u2013 family sitcom fails to raise enough laughs</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Miranda, though sometimes ill behaved \u2013 especially toward her neighbor Patrick (Erik Stocklin) who harbors a crush on her \u2013 is not a bad person. Sure she might try to use a man\u2019s funeral as a career launchpad, but deep down she\u2019s a misfit who is looking for validation through the adoration she feel she deserves. Is that so unrelatable? All right, maybe it is, but it sure is funny. </p> <p>Sometimes the awkwardness might wrestle control away from the comedy but through equal measures of slapstick and goofiness there is at least one reason to laugh out loud in each episode, like when the choir director asks if she\u2019s an alto or soprano and Miranda replies, \u201cI\u2019m an American.\u201d </p> <p>While the origin of Miranda Sings might be rooted in the misguided people who seek fame through YouTube and the conventions of the genre (her makeup tutorials are a thing <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7QMR8uN6_0\">of absurdist genius</a>), by moving the scope of her comedy and worldview, Ballinger gets at something that is not only a cultural critique but often hits on the fragility of egos and everyone\u2019s need for acceptance. Miranda Sings is no longer just a personality, she\u2019s a real, full-fledged human being. </p>",

  "<p>You can just imagine the looks on Warner Bros executives\u2019 faces when JK Rowling presented them with the curate\u2019s egg that is Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them. Yes, she would deliver more stories set in the wizarding world of Harry Potter for a new trilogy of movies. No, there would be no more adventures for Harry himself, nor Ron, nor Hermione (at least on the big screen). Indeed, the new stories would not even be set in the UK, a location that always seemed perfect for Rowling\u2019s very British blend of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/enid-blyton\">Blytonesque</a> boarding school whimsy and darkling magical intrigue. </p> <p>The biggest takeaway from last night\u2019s global Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them fan event \u2013 more than a dozen cities around the world vying to outscream each other in a satellite-linked outpouring of devotion to a movie no one has seen yet \u2013 might just be that the Boy Who Lived was not, after all, the star of the show. Looking around in the auditorium of the plush Cineworld Empire Imax in Leicester Square, it\u2019s apparent that pretty much nobody is dressed up as Potter. But there are witchy flappers \u2013 in tribute to the new film\u2019s setting 1920s New York \u2013 zillions of Newt Scamanders (Eddie Redmayne\u2019s nerdy, bright-eyed oddball hero and owner of the titular monsters) and even a few dressed up as Jacob Kowalski, the portly \u201cNo-Maj\u201d (the American version of the Muggle) played by Dan Fogler.</p> <p>And when the author \u2013 and debut screenwriter \u2013 suddenly joins Redmayne, pals Katherine Waterston (Porpentina) and Alison Sudol (Queenie) and Fogler on stage, everything comes into focus. Rowling, not Potter, is the star, and she\u2019s built up such a remarkable repository of trust with her fans that they are ready and willing to lap up everything she sends their way. I think they\u2019re probably right to be confident.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6599a4ea17b39c29c5b6539b1559efa3c0b59d58\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6599a4ea17b39c29c5b6539b1559efa3c0b59d58/0_0_3500_2333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Eddie Redmayne \u2013 AKA Newt Scamander \u2013 attends the fan event.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Eddie Redmayne \u2013 AKA Newt Scamander \u2013 attends the fan event.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ian West/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There may have been wobbles along the way \u2013 including the rather embarrassing moment when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/mar/09/jk-rowling-under-fire-for-appropriating-navajo-tradition-history-of-magic-in-north-america-pottermore\">the British author found herself accused of cultural appropriation by a blogger on Native American culture</a> \u2013 but Rowling\u2019s attention to detail in the buildup to Fantastic Beasts\u2019 release has gone way beyond Hollywood\u2019s usual standards. Her Pottermore site is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/mar/08/jk-rowling-casts-fresh-spells-in-new-stories-for-pottermore\">filled with original writing</a> on the North American wizarding world, its native beasties, peculiar witchy culture and history of conflict between the magical and non-magical populations. This feeds into belief that Scamander\u2019s story is not merely a money-spinning contrivance for Warner Bros to continue a series that stands behind the Marvel superhero films as the second highest-grossing franchise of all time. Rather, the feeling is that this is a bona fide JK Rowling creation to rival her Potter work, and, crucially, one written directly for the screen.</p> <p>Waterston suggested the writer\u2019s eye for detail ran through every aspect of Fantastic Beasts\u2019 production, even down to the key magical trio\u2019s choice of wands.</p> <p>\u201cThey were so genuinely interested in what each of us had to say,\u201d she gushed. \u201cI got an email with five options for a wand. I picked the one I wanted, but it was too light, so they went back, fixed it. I thought, my God, I\u2019ll have a banana split! It\u2019s extremely rare to get that detail in a movie of this scale.\u201d</p> <p>Keeping this focus on the finer points of wizarding aesthetics will be key if Fantastic Beasts is to survive what looks set to be a rapid expansion in scope. Rowling revealed the saga will now stretch to at least five movies \u2013 Potter made it to eight, lest we forget \u2013 with each instalment likely to see Newt visiting a new major city. The prospect of a glimpse into magical culture around the globe is certainly tantalising, and suggests the new saga may eventually move beyond Rowling\u2019s previous series in terms of scale.</p> <p>The franchise is also due to see the return of a young Albus Dumbledore, and there will be a prominent role in the films for his great rival and one-time friend, Gellert Grindelwald. The latter\u2019s presence looks like it will be clearly felt in Fantastic Beasts, though perhaps as the kind of background threat that Voldemort presented in the early Potter books and movies.</p> <p>\u201cWe do mention Dumbledore in this movie, and he features a little bit in a wonderful scene between Colin [Farrell] and Eddie [Redmayne],\u201d teased director David Yates.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3596bc8c5fbbc056ec4e521948ad4df882440c19\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3596bc8c5fbbc056ec4e521948ad4df882440c19/0_0_3500_2333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Redmayne in Fantastic Beasts.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Redmayne in Fantastic Beasts.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jaap Buitendijk/2016 Warner Bros/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Meanwhile Farrell, who plays high-ranking <a href=\"http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Auror\">auror</a> and director of US magical security Percival Graves, dropped the biggest hint yet that his character might have Death Eater-style prejudice towards the non-magical population. \u201cIf there is a superior race, it\u2019s not the No-Majs in his mind,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The event climaxed with attendees being shown the first 10 minutes of the movie itself. It opens with an operatic, Potter-style montage of newspaper headlines, detailing Grindelwald\u2019s attacks in Europe and the growing threat to North America\u2019s magical population from Samantha Morton\u2019s grim-browed Mary Lou and her witch-hating Second Salemers. Scamander himself is barely mentioned, but we\u2019re soon on to the arrival of Redmayne\u2019s charming, eccentric \u201cmagizoologist\u201d in New York, looking the very definition of young fogey chic, with briefcase, waistcoat, bow tie and long coat, a touch of Tom Baker-era Doctor Who about him. Suffice to say it\u2019s not long before the beasts are starting to escape \u2013 the platypus-like Niffler, with a love for shiny things, is the first to venture out of Newt\u2019s Tardis-like briefcase.</p> <p>Will Rowling really be able to stretch the saga to five movies? Fantastic Beasts\u2019 structural furniture already looks more tricky than that of the Potter films, which simply set up Voldemort\u2019s nemesis for a new adventure in every school year. Surely Scamander won\u2019t lose all his monsters every time he turns up somewhere new? As a creative device that could get pretty old pretty quickly.</p> <p>But in a Hollywood beset by weak sequels, remakes and failing cinematic universes, Rowling\u2019s presence is a comforting one. She cares about these characters, their motivations, their backgrounds, the worlds in which they live. She is unlikely to be told what to do by meddling studio execs, and this time around there are no troublesome books to be adapted, no details to be dispensed with to fit running times, and no deeply green young actors heroically doing their best in almost impossible circumstances.</p> <p>All the indications so far are that Rowling\u2019s fans are probably right to be excited about the prospect of more quirky high adventure in the rapidly expanding Potterverse. The magic might just be back. </p>",
  "<p>In April, almost five years after the footballer Ched Evans was first accused of raping a 19-year-old waitress in a hotel room, a 16-page judgment on his case was handed down in the appeal court.</p> <p>It quashed his conviction and ordered a retrial \u2013 clearly a huge step for Evans, his complainant and all those around them. But following his acquittal in the retrial, the ramifications may go much further than that. </p> <p>Women\u2019s support groups and campaigners believe the appeal court\u2019s judgment dangerously undermines the legislation designed to protect victims of sexual assault by restricting what courts can hear about a complainant\u2019s sexual history and behaviour. </p> <p>There is huge concern that the Evans retrial \u2013 during which the complainant was quizzed in detail and at length about whom she had had sex with, the positions she favoured and the language she used during it \u2013 may stop some women reporting rape and other offences for fear they will find themselves in the same situation. </p> <p>The route to this appeal court decision was long, tortuous and controversial. </p> <p>Evans\u2019 friends and family bankrolled a high-profile campaign to try to prove his innocence. <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://chedevans.com/\">The Ched Evans website</a> offered a \u00a350,000 reward for information leading to the footballer\u2019s acquittal, posted versions of that night\u2019s events favourable to him, and made allegations against the waitress. In the first two years of its operation it received more than 2m hits.</p> <p>At times the campaign sailed close to the wind. Evans\u2019 fiancee, Natasha Massey, was accused by the prosecution during the retrial of trying to induce a key prosecution witness to change his evidence by flagging up the existence of the reward. </p> <p>The wealth of Evans and Massey (she is a millionaire\u2019s daughter) meant the Evans camp could assemble a team of PR people and top lawyers who succeeded in getting the accusations against Evans back before a fresh jury. Such resources would be available to very few convicted men. </p> <h2><strong>The appeal </strong></h2> <p>At the heart of the successful appeal were fresh statements from two young men who described their sexual relations with the complainant, who was referred to in the crucial appeal court judgment as X, at around the time of the alleged rape in May 2011. </p> <p>One, Y, actually came forward the day after Evans was found guilty in April 2012 to say she had had sex with him following the incident. He thought it \u201cinconsistent\u201d that she had slept with him a fortnight after she was attacked and \u2013 at a time when social media was alive with abuse about her \u2013 he came to the conclusion she was motivated by greed when she went to the police. </p> <p>A man called Jack Higgins \u2013 who along with Evans\u2019 younger brother Ryan voyeuristically peered in through the hotel window at the footballer and X \u2013 asked him to speak to Evans\u2019 defence. He was briefly interviewed but his evidence was not used at that time.</p> <p>In September 2015, the witness was re-interviewed by a private detective who was part of the new beefed-up Evans legal team. <a href=\"http://https//www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/oct/11/witness-in-ched-evans-retrial-accused-of-lying-to-land-50000-reward\">At this point he said X directed the sex and used the phrase: \u201cFuck me harder.\u201d</a> It was the first time he claimed she had used these words.</p> <p>The explicit phrase is important because it chimes with what Evans claimed had happened in his encounter with X. He continues to insist she used exactly the same language. </p> <p>A second man, Z, who was in a sexual relationship with X at the time of the alleged rape, had also made a rather bland statement back in September 2011. </p> <p>In December 2015, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/oct/12/second-ched-evans-defence-witness-denies-payment-motive\">he gave a much more detailed account to a member of Evans\u2019 new legal team </a>in which he said X had used the phrase \u201cGo harder\u201d with him. </p> <p>Kieran Vaughan QC, for Evans, argued at the appeal court in the spring that there were \u201cstriking\u201d similarities in the accounts of the two witnesses and that of Evans and they might support a defence of actual consent.</p> <p>The law that Vaughan and Evans were up against as they tried to get the new testimony of the two men put before a new jury was the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://%20http//www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1999/23/contents\">Youth and Criminal Evidence Act 1999</a>. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1999/23/part/II/chapter/III\">Section 41</a> imposes stringent restrictions on what evidence can be put before a court by the defence about an alleged victim\u2019s sexual behaviour and on the questioning of the complainant in court. </p> <p>The provision was designed to counter the \u201ctwin myths\u201d \u2013 that \u201cunchaste\u201d women are more likely to consent to intercourse and in any event are less worthy of belief. </p> <p>However, the defence can get such testimony heard \u2013 and thus open the alleged victim up to potentially hugely intrusive and upsetting questioning \u2013 <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.cps.gov.uk/legal/p_to_r/rape_and_sexual_offences/yjcea_1999/\">if the crucial issue is consent </a>and the behaviour the witnesses claim is so similar to how a complainant is said to have acted during an alleged offence that it cannot reasonably be explained as coincidence. </p> <p>As<a href=\"http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/westminster_hall/2002/apr/24/rape-trials#S6CV0384P0_20020424_WH_82\"> far back as 2002</a> Vera Baird QC pointed out the dangers of the exemption and called for an introduction of the Canadian law which states that a defendant must prove \u201creasonable steps to ascertain that the complainant was consenting\u201d. She said: \u201cThat law focuses attention firmly on the events at the time, which must, logically, determine or, at the very least, dominate the defendant\u2019s belief. What the man believed on the basis of rumours about the woman would, rightly, be pushed to the margins and would usually be completely excluded.\u201d</p> <p>As a result home office <a href=\"http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.628.3925&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf\">published research</a> in 2006 which found that out of rape cases coming out of England and Wales in a three-month period in 2003, applications to introduce sexual history were made in a quarter of cases, two thirds of these were successful. </p> <p>Eleanor Laws QC, for the crown, described what Evans\u2019 team was trying to do as a \u201cpost-trial investigation into the sexual behaviour of a complainant\u201d. She said it had the potential to undermine parliament\u2019s attempt to abolish the \u201ctwin myths\u201d.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Laws pointed out the sort of sexual activity the men described and the words the complainant was said to have used were commonplace. </p> <p>During the appeal hearing, Laws claimed the delay in the men\u2019s testimony bore all the hallmarks of witnesses being \u201cfed\u201d information by people close to Evans. In the retrial, prosecutor Simon Medland QC put to both of them that they had been motivated by the \u00a350,000 reward. The allegations were strongly denied by Evans\u2019 team and the men. </p> <p>The vice-president of the court of appeal criminal division, Lady Justice Hallett, who heard the appeal with two other judges, said the evidence would be admissible only if the defence could \u201covercome the high hurdle of relevance and similarity\u201d.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Hallett also said Laws was right to emphasise the importance of offering complainants in sexual offences protection from \u201cintrusive and unnecessary questioning about their sexual history\u201d.</p> <p>However, she said with \u201ca considerable degree of hesitation\u201d the court had decided that the evidence of Y and Z could be admitted. She added: \u201cThis a rare case in which it will be appropriate to indulge in this kind of forensic examination of sexual behaviour with others.\u201d <a href=\"https://www.judiciary.gov.uk/judgments/r-v-chedwyn-evans/\">Evans\u2019 conviction was quashed </a>and a retrial ordered. </p> <h2><strong>The \u2018bribe\u2019</strong></h2> <p>During the retrial the jury was afforded glimpses into the Evans campaign \u2013 they knew there was a reward and heard something of how the two crucial witnesses\u2019 evidence surfaced. </p> <p>They were not allowed to hear about Massey\u2019s approach to a vital prosecution witness, Gavin Burrough, who was on the hotel reception desk when the complainant arrived that night and who later said she was \u201cout of it\u201d.</p> <p>The approach came in May 2013, soon after the reward was first offered. Massey sent Burrough a message via Facebook telling him she was at a \u201cloose end\u201d.</p> <p>She wrote: \u201cWe are appealing for new information. There is a \u00a350,000 reward for any new evidence. Do you know anything that could help Ched? He\u2019s spent nearly 13 months locked up in prison for a crime that never happened. I\u2019m pleading with you if you know anything.\u201d She signed off with a kiss. </p> <p>Burrough did nothing. </p> <p>The next morning she contacted him again: \u201cOK. I see you have chosen to ignore me. I understand you want to put it all behind you. If you can deal with the fact that Ched is innocent and he\u2019s spending the next 17 months in prison and you can just sit back and let it happen so be it. I\u2019m literally begging. If you know anything please help me x.\u201d</p> <p>In legal arguments at Cardiff, the prosecution argued that the messages should be put before the jury. Medland claimed Burrough was being asked to consider altering his testimony. He said: \u201cThere is no direct evidence it is a bribe but it is subtle and repeated inducement to change his evidence to support the case for the defendant.\u2019\u2019 Medland said the messages were \u201cakin to a bribe\u201d and had \u201cthe flavour of a bribe\u201d. </p> <p>The prosecution suggested the \u201cinducement\u201d demonstrated the \u201cimbalance of power\u201d between Evans and the complainant. He was a wealthy, professional footballer, she a 19-year-old waitress. Medland said it would be \u201cartificial to imagine Evans was unaware of what was going on\u201d. </p> <p>Evans\u2019 defence said he was in prison at the time and there was no evidence he knew anything of the messages or that they were sent at his behest. The trial judge, Mrs Justice Nicola Davies, allowed the existence of the reward to go before the jury but not Massey\u2019s approach and rejected the claim it had the \u201cflavour of a bribe\u201d.</p> <p>There is no suggestion that Evans\u2019 team has done anything wrong. But there is a real concern that the appeal case and the retrial will stop abused women coming forward and will make it harder for prosecutors to get justice for victims of sexual offences.</p>",
  "<p><strong>I am increasingly worried about my 19-year-old son, who isn\u2019t in regular work and who has started stealing from other family members.</strong></p> <p><strong>He dropped out of education before completing his A-levels and has since had a series of labouring jobs where the pay isn\u2019t good. He has never been a&#xa0;great communicator, but his life is a&#xa0;total mystery as he never brings friends home. My husband and I both work, and we have a nice home and a&#xa0;good standard of living. My son has a&#xa0;free rein and we put very few demands on him. He is able to help himself to&#xa0;whatever he wants from the fridge and has his own room. It is like having a stranger in the house, who comes and goes. And, while he can be&#xa0;perfectly pleasant, he can also be verbally abusive to me and his sister if we upset him \u2013 it doesn\u2019t take much, such as asking him how his search for a job is going.</strong></p> <p><strong>Sentimental items of jewellery have&#xa0;gone missing in the past, and when challenged he denied all knowledge. A&#xa0;few weeks ago, some money went missing from my daughter\u2019s room. I&#xa0;had cleaned her room that morning (I&#xa0;have two very messy grownup kids) and had seen it.&#xa0;The following day, I&#xa0;searched his room and found evidence that he had taken it. When challenged, he said he needed the money but would replace it \u2013 although he didn\u2019t. </strong></p> <p><strong>My husband is furious and is angry at me for not telling him at the time. I had been trying to avoid a row by giving my son an opportunity to put the money back. The pattern of our parenting has generally been that my husband cracks the whip and I think he is too harsh and so I collude with the kids to try to protect them.</strong></p> <p><strong>My husband says he won\u2019t live with a thief in the house. My son does have friends with whom he can stay, but they are mostly non-working dope-smokers (just like my son, I guess). I&#xa0;am afraid that if we make him homeless, his problems will just get worse.&#xa0; </strong></p> <p>My first thought was how disengaged you all seem from one another, and the curious lack of detail, as if you have all been bumbling along until now.</p> <p>I contacted Angela Evans, a child and adolescent psychotherapist (<a href=\"http://childpsychotherapy.org.uk/\" title=\"\">childpsychotherapy.org.uk</a>), who has worked extensively with troubled teenagers. One of the first things she picked up on was that you are cleaning the rooms of your grownup children. She feels this is indicative of something else \u2013 perhaps an inability to let go of your role of mothering (this is not to apportion blame, but it may help to identify your own colluding behaviour) and therefore your son not being able to separate and become his own person.</p> <p>\u201cAdolescence is about separating from adults,\u201d explains Evans. \u201cTo an extent, you should be experiencing your older teenage children like a stranger.\u201d Evans feels that your son probably already felt like a failure, finding himself out of education, with no aim or job. She thinks you should stop asking him how the job hunt is going, as this will just provoke more anxiety. Also, it becomes about your agenda, not his. In Evans\u2019 extensive experience of working with teens, she says, \u201cLying and stealing is classic behaviour among difficult teenagers when they are angry and feel left out \u2013 it replaces an emptiness.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If we take the stealing as a form of communication, what do you think your son is trying to say to you?</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Clearly, however, some major communication channel has broken down between you all.</p> <p>You mention drugs, in passing, and I&#xa0;wonder how much of a factor that is. If he is on drugs, his behaviour, explains Evans, \u201cis not driven by the thinking part of the brain\u201d. (You may find <a href=\"http://talktofrank.com\" title=\"\">talktofrank.com</a> useful.)</p> <p>If we take the stealing as a form of communication, what do you think your son is trying to say to you? I was especially struck that he stole jewellery from you that had sentimental value. This seems \u2013 if he were thinking about it at all \u2013 like a particularly aggressive act. Evans wonders what the relationship is like between him and his sister? \u201cIs she the \u2018good\u2019 sibling?\u201d It\u2019s interesting that he seems to have stolen from you and his sister, not his father.</p> <p>What to do about it? \u201cThe key is for you and your husband to be a team,\u201d says Evans. \u201cYou need to talk and find a middle ground you are both happy with.\u201d When you have talked, Evans suggests you then talk, and listen, to your son. \u201cYou need to draw up a contract to make family life run smoother. His growing adulthood needs to be recognised, but there also has to be no stealing. You need to make time to check in with one another and respect one another\u2019s spaces. Your daughter could be part of the contract and family discussions too, as she will be part of the family\u2019s dynamic.\u201d</p> <p>You all need to agree on certain standards of behaviour. \u201cThen you all sign it,\u201d says Evans. \u201cIf he\u2019s still hopeless, if he doesn\u2019t want to sign it, try to model the behaviour anyway.\u201d If you are fair and decided, you will be confident, but it is key that you work out your parameters. There\u2019s no point saying, \u201cIf you don\u2019t do this, this will happen\u201d, if you know you won\u2019t be able to do that. I do feel you need to be more confident in your handling of your son.</p> <p>Finally, says Evans, \u201cstop cleaning your children\u2019s rooms, let them take responsibility, encourage them to be&#xa0;independent\u201d.</p> <h2><strong>Your problems solved</strong></h2> <p><strong> </strong></p> <p>Contact Annalisa Barbieri, The Guardian, Kings Place, 90 York Way, London N1 9GU, or email\u2008<a href=\"mailto:annalisa.barbieri@mac.com\" title=\"\">annalisa.barbieri@mac.com</a>.

  "<h2>FC Copenhagen</h2> <p><em>The reigning Danish champions have won their domestic league, the Superligaen, 11 times and are on course for another league title this season. They are competing in this season\u2019s Champions League.</em></p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a drastic but interesting idea, as it will get more and more difficult to qualify for the Champions League in the future. My club feels we belong at the top level of European competition on a regular basis. Playing in the Champions League is a big thing for Scandinavian clubs. They get covered extensively in the Scandinavian press, not just in domestic newspapers. <br></p> <p>A breakaway league would not be good for the Danish Superliga unfortunately. Uefa should consider whether it\u2019s the right strategy to make it so difficult for champions of smaller European leagues like the Danish one to qualify for their tournaments.\u201d <strong><em>Benjamin</em></strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"67292ca1627577a1b201296e4620369a24f12bad\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/67292ca1627577a1b201296e4620369a24f12bad/0_0_3768_2934/1000.jpg\" alt=\"FC Copenhagen\u2019s Andreas Cornelius jumps for the ball during the recent Champions League match against Club Brugge.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"779\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">FC Copenhagen\u2019s Andreas Cornelius jumps for the ball during the recent Champions League match against Club Brugge.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jens Dresling/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Brondby IF</h2> <p><em>Brondby IF have won the Danish Superliga 10 times, but their last success was back in the 2004-05 season. They reached the quarter-finals of the European Cup in 1986-87, </em><em>but have not qualified for the Champions League since finishing bottom of their </em><em>group in 1997-98.</em><em> They were UEFA Cup semi-finalists in 1991, but haven\u2019t qualified for the competition since back in 2003/04</em><em>.</em></p> <p>\u201cThe economic benefits from competing in the Champions League for a Danish club are huge. It can secure the club budget for several years if a club qualify for the group stage and, of course, attract more supporters to stadium. By minimising the chance of participation in the Champions League, there could be a risk of even fewer supporters in stadiums and even less reason for domestic players to play in the domestic leagues. </p> <p>It makes perfect sense for the likes of FC Copenhagen and Norwegian champions Rosenborg to pursue this idea because of the obvious commercial benefits it would bring for the clubs. But the opposing point of view would be wanting to develop Danish football overall rather than make the bigger clubs even richer. We already have a huge problem of retaining Danish profiles in our own domestic league and even a move to a Championship side or Bundesliga 2 side would seem more interesting than playing for a mid-table Superliga club. </p> <p>For the last 10 years FC Copenhagen have dominated domestic club football in Denmark. A breakaway league could tighten the domestic top flight of course, and add much needed drama to the last rounds of the season.\u201d <strong><em>William Kaarsberg </em></strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b05b519cb3768cf463226a0df65fd8099da36f87\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b05b519cb3768cf463226a0df65fd8099da36f87/0_0_2401_1624/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Brondby\u2019s Daniel Agger in heated discussion during a Danish Superliga match against rivals FC Copenhagen.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"676\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Brondby\u2019s Daniel Agger in heated discussion during a Danish Superliga match against rivals FC Copenhagen.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lars Ronbog/FrontzoneSport via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Malmo FF</h2> <p><em>Malmo have been crowned Swedish champions 21 times in their history. They were </em><em>beaten finalists in the </em><em>European Cup in the 1978-79 season.</em></p> <p>\u201cAn Atlantic league pools together the resources of smaller countries and may enable their clubs to be more competitive. As a Malmo fan I\u2019m reasonably confident that my team would be included in any Atlantic league, however the effect on the domestic Allsvenskan would be a real concern. A play-off every year between the bottom Swedish team in the breakaway league against the winner of Allsvenskan could be a good compromise. </p> <p>The effect on national leagues is an issue worthy of concern, but to me it seems that we need to compare the weakening of Swedish, Danish and Dutch leagues against a \u2018European\u2019 competition where only teams from three or four countries can realistically compete.</p> <p>The Champions League peaked in the late 90s and early 00s, when there was a fine mix between ensuring multiple big teams from Italy, Spain and England - while still allowing a representation of teams such as Dynamo Kiev, Porto, PSV, Lyon, Olympiakos and Galatasaray. Since Porto\u2019s 2004 win, Lyon and PSV have been the only clubs outside the big four leagues to threaten reaching a final. The current situation is so skewed towards Bayern Munich and the Spanish duopoly. But I don\u2019t believe that a proposed Super League will ever happen. The likes of PSG, Real Madrid, Barcelona and Bayern will not want to risk competing in a league in which they could credibly finish last.\u201d <strong><em>Sam</em></strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"70914b8af9a6aca8adc9081b0480ff60c37a9815\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/70914b8af9a6aca8adc9081b0480ff60c37a9815/0_0_2211_1399/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Malmo forward Markus Rosenberg celebrates scoring the opening goal against FC Shakhtar Donetsk during the 2015 Champions League.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"633\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Malmo forward Markus Rosenberg celebrates after scoring against Shakhtar Donetsk in the Champions League in 2015.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andreasw Hillergren/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Osters IF</strong><br></h2> <p><em>Osters have won the Allsvenskan four times but have not had any silverware since the 1981 season. They currently play in the third tier of the Swedish league.</em></p> <p>\u201cThe proposed Atlantic League is a result of the proposals for the changed Champions League format. Both are killing football as we know it and should be opposed as fervently as possible. Uefa is too weak on this, but what else could you expect. It\u2019s an organisation in turmoil. European football is moving towards American sports where there is no relegation battle, no promotion and only the winner counts. Where\u2019s the joy in that? Let\u2019s be honest, the Allsvenskan is a terribly weak league as it is today. Take the least bad side out of it and it will only get worse.\u201d <strong><em>ExileInSthlm</em></strong></p> <h2><em>Valerenga</em></h2> <p><em>Five times winners of the Norwegian top flight, but their last success was over a decade a go with their 2005 Tippeligaen title.</em></p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s an interesting idea but needs to be thought through and administered correctly. The failed <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_League\">Royal League</a> experiment showed that it isn\u2019t easy to create a new competition out of thin air. One major consideration is that it would have to be a spring/summer competition as the weather in Norway and Sweden during the winter months is not conducive to football outdoors. </p> <p>I fear for domestic Norwegian football should this happen. Rosenborg have dominated for many years \u2013 getting richer while the rest of the Tippeligaen gets poorer. There are clubs here that are on the verge of bankruptcy \u2013 and many times the Rosenborg home fixtures are a financial anchor. </p> <p>If Rosenborg withdraw fully from the Tippeligaen to join an Atlantic League - would that free up the Norwegian European Places \u2013 or would it simply mean that they monopolise the spot normally given to our champions? \u2013 thereby cutting off vital prize money and Uefa money for our clubs should they somehow (as Molde and Str\u00f8msgodset did a few years ago) manage to win the Tippeligaen?\u201d <strong><em>Krister Halvorsen</em></strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b4f96145ab5dfc7458b1629a0f49f93d75a33f58\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b4f96145ab5dfc7458b1629a0f49f93d75a33f58/0_0_720_540/500.jpg\" alt=\"Fans of Norwegian Premier League side V\u00e5lerenga display the Norwegian flag prior to a league match.\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fans of Norwegian Premier League side Valerenga display the Norwegian flag prior to a league match.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: KristerHalvorsen/GuardianWitness</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Celtic</h2> <p><em>Celtic have amassed 47 league titles but their only European success remains as winners of the European Cup in 1966-67. </em></p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a shame that it has to come to this but, if the proposed changes to the Champions League are made, the difference in quality between the so called \u201cbigger clubs\u201d compared to the teams from the smaller leagues will continue to increase. Quality and money is decreasing in these leagues and perhaps a new league is the only way to get more money back into domestic football. As a Celtic fan I want to see European football every year. If that can\u2019t be in the Champions League, we\u2019ll need it from elsewhere. Also the current state of Scottish club football is not very competitive which is resulting in less and less interest.</p> <p>A breakaway league could mean two things for domestic football in Scotland - either less money is put into the league, with less interest from Celtic and Rangers, or the league becomes more competitive amongst the other teams and in turn becomes more interesting. Uefa is ensuring that the already huge gulf in money between Europe\u2019s largest and smallest clubs is only going to get wider making it harder for clubs such as Celtic and Rangers to ever catch up.\u201d <strong><em>Rameez Mahmood</em></strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"51de7a248a3fc11ec18cc59ad546a4d50f635f95\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/51de7a248a3fc11ec18cc59ad546a4d50f635f95/0_0_4012_2708/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Celtic\" width=\"1000\" height=\"675\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Celtic players clap their fans after a 7-0 defeat to Barcelona.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alejandro Garcia/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Rangers</h2> <p><em>Rangers have won the Scottish first division 54 times.

But there\u2019s plenty of details that need to be considered carefully. Would there be promotion and relegation from the domestic leagues? What Scottish clubs would be involved? As a Rangers fan, we might not be in the top 10 teams from those countries in terms of our current side, but we\u2019re a huge club and would want to be involved, hopefully on merit and not just because of our size and commercial appeal.</p> <p>Potential loss of TV revenue would have an effect on the Scottish league, but there\u2019s a positive as well: if you take the old firm out of the SPFL it suddenly becomes a very competitive league. Motherwell, Hearts, Aberdeen and Dundee United could all have won titles in the last ten years and plenty of other clubs would be in with a shout. I would hope it would lead to a league reconstruction as well \u2013 a 16- or 18-team top flight, minus the Old Firm, would accommodate most of the full time clubs in the country.\u201d <strong><em>Greg</em></strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3623f21233e9598d550c2cd3cc2bcc66630a66f5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3623f21233e9598d550c2cd3cc2bcc66630a66f5/0_0_3500_2380/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rangers fans watching their team in the early evening sunlight at Ibrox Stadium, Glasgow.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"680\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rangers fans watching their team in the early evening sunlight at Ibrox Stadium, Glasgow.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Runnacles/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>St Johnstone</h2> <p><em>St Johnstone\u2019s finest domestic success was winning the Scottish Cup in 2014.</em></p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid cash is king in modern football, and a breakaway league looks to be the only way the big clubs in these leagues mentioned would be able to stay vaguely competitive with the big clubs from the main European leagues. Right now it\u2019s too much to ask for them to switch from easy wins against their domestic rivals to competing against top class opposition.</p> <p>In Scottish domestic football you\u2019d be looking at a situation where a team like Celtic either leaves the league altogether, and everyone feels they have a better chance of winning, or they develop their youngsters in a B team in the domestic league, which potentially strengthens the national team in the long run, as young players are getting competitive games at a decent level.\u201d <strong><em>Fraser</em></strong></p> <h2>PSV Eindhoven</h2> <p><em>PSV won the domestic Dutch league 23 times, while winning the European Cup in 1987/88 and the Uefa Cup in 1977/78.</em></p> <p>\u201cI understand why the clubs want it as there would be more competitive games and more money. But all it would do is entrench the current positions - protect the status of the big teams and make it harder for smaller sides to rise up in the future. Do Celtic fans want to come to Eindhoven? Sure yes, but one time every three or four years rather than two times a year surely. And is it really a step up for PSV or Ajax to play FC Copenhagen or Rosenborg on a regular basis?</p> <p>An \u2018Atlantic league\u2019 would hurt our domestic Eredivisie terribly.

Ajax, PSV and Feyenoord have rich European-competition histories but none can realistically hope to win a European cup again the way things are progressing now - there\u2019s not enough money or glamour in our domestic league to keep hold of the best players. I think we can all see the writing on the wall for football as we know it, and there will inevitably be some major changes to the structure of the leagues and competitions. </p> <p>My local Dutch team is SC Heerenveen. It\u2019s a club that is known for finding and producing talent. Quite a few well known players have passed through the club but apart from one disastrous season in the Champions League, and a few Dutch Cup final appearances with only one success to show for it, there have been no domestic league titles - though we are apparently the most financially secure club in the Eredivisie. This Atlantic League means our league would lose the little quality and star attraction that it arguably still has. If those clubs would then also be permitted to play B Squads in the national league, then that would kill any chance of attracting or keeping the best players for the smaller clubs. This is also assuming the Atlantic League would eschew promotion and relegation, which one imagines would be a prerogative of these breakaway clubs. Revenue sharing will of course always be the fly in the ointment, whatever the system, and small clubs and countries wll always be at a disadvantage.\u201d <strong><em>Hearrenfeanboy</em></strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4341459b55c8c2f4d1c51c8170a4914ea9e23567\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4341459b55c8c2f4d1c51c8170a4914ea9e23567/0_0_3543_2362/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Heerenveen\u2019s Daley Sinkgraven, now playing for Ajax, scores the winning goal in a Eredivisie match between SC Heerenveen and PSV Eindhoven on 28 September 2014.

They have won the European Cup four times, the Cup Winners\u2019 Cup once, the Uefa Cup back in 1991/92 and the Uefa Super Cup twice. </em></p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a great idea and a well overdue attempt at countering the influence of ridiculous sums of money. It\u2019ll hopefully allow for some of the larger teams in Europe\u2019s smaller domestic leagues to more regularly measure themselves against higher quality opponents than are available in their domestic leagues. Ajax would be a stronger team for being able to play against the likes of FC Copenhagen or Club Brugge over the likes of Willem II or De Graafschap.</p> <p>The Dutch Eredivisie continues its slow decline in terms of quality - both in terms of the football being played and the players representing the clubs. In years past the top clubs in Holland, and presumably Belgium and Denmark, would be able to enjoy the fruits of their youth systems for a number of seasons before they were tempted away by big money contracts in larger European leagues. We\u2019re now seeing our best and brightest pilfered from the academies before they\u2019ve played a single game for the first team. The result is less quality, less viewers and less sponsorship interest in our domestic competition and a waning ability to attract quality players to our clubs. The slow downward spiral of quality means less automatic qualification places in competitions like the Champions League and Europa League. The gulf between the big clubs in smaller competitions and any club in a larger competition seems certain to grow with the current systems in place.</p> <p>UEFA clearly has little regard for the development or health of club football across Europe\u2019s smaller nations. I think the breakaway league is a bold initiative to give clubs and supporters a better level of competition in which to measure themselves. It will give supporters and sponsors a better quality of football and will hopefully go some way to redress the ever increasing levels of disparity between European footballing haves and the have-nots.\u201d <strong><em>Martyn</em></strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9531f34afca3fcc21939cb1dcd59131a2e82b879\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9531f34afca3fcc21939cb1dcd59131a2e82b879/0_0_5568_3712/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ajax\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ajax players celebrate after scoring a goal against Utrecht in October. 2016</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Olaf Kraak/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Feyenoord</h2> <p><em>Crowned Eredivisie champions 14 times in their history with their last success back in 1998-99.

There will be teams who feel left out from every league and will not let it happen. And do they take the clubs with the biggest fan base or go with the best record of the last five or ten years? Clubs like Feyenoord or Rangers should be in but they haven\u2019t won the league for so long.</p> <p>There\u2019s no doubt that the Belgian Pro League would suffer as a result, and the reaction to the breakaway league is therefore very negative overall.

On one hand the idea of playing top teams from various European leagues is quite an interesting one, but on the other we need to protect Belgian domestic football that has had a recent boost. The Belgian league has become a little stronger after the introduction of a playoff system, where at the end of the season the top six teams play home and away games against each other after having the points they\u2019ve accumulated throughout the season cut in half before the start to the playoffs, resulting in a few weeks of exiting football madness. It would be a shame to lose all that excitement, especially for the neutral football fan. I also have my doubts about the practicality of such a formula. Teams would have to fly back and forth every week which might have a negative impact on the physical condition of the players.</p> <p>The gap between the top and and smaller Belgian teams has narrowed quite a bit due to a much more professional approach by these so-called smaller teams. In the last few years new stadiums have been built for the likes of Gent, Zulte Waregem, Oostende and KV Mechelen. All the efforts to revitalise the domestic league would go right down the drain. Do we really want that to happen?</p> <p>I would be more in favour of a BeNe-League with the top 10 teams of Belgium and Holland competing for the title. It\u2019s an idea the top teams of both countries have been playing with for quite some time but it never got off the drawing board.\u201d <strong><em>Johan De Coninck</em></strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4fcd6b48e76a5d2cad435ca8566d18f88fb4ec90\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4fcd6b48e76a5d2cad435ca8566d18f88fb4ec90/0_0_1812_1137/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Anderlecht\u2019s Youri Tielemans and Leander Dendoncker celebrate after scoring against St Etienne in the UEFA Europa League\" width=\"1000\" height=\"627\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Anderlecht\u2019s Youri Tielemans and Leander Dendoncker celebrate after scoring against St Etienne in the Europa League.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Robert Pratta/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Gent</h2> <p><em>Winners of the 2013-14 Belgian First Division title.</em></p> <p>\u201cIt was only last season that KAA Gent took Europe by storm, when we became only the second Belgian side in history to advance to the Champions League round of 16. It infuriates me to see these so-called \u201csmall European clubs\u201d maligned and marginalised, despite excellent form and dominance in their respective leagues.

It would allow the strongest regional teams to compete and become stronger still. All too often the domestic competition beyond the top two four teams is weak, holding back overall development. This new league would be good for strong domestic sides, slightly worse for the weaker ones, but something for everyone to aim at. </p> <p>Why not have regional competitons to supplement domestic leagues? Scrap the Europa League and break it down to the Champions League and then regional competitions (North Atlantic, Southen Europe, Central Europe) to run alongside that.\u201d <strong><em>Rob Gallo</em></strong></p>",

Apparently Kumbuku had a reputation for being \u201cprotective\u201d of his family, and on this occasion he rushed aggressively at the glass, banging on it, before escaping into the keeper\u2019s area behind his enclosure.</p> <p>But a more nuanced understanding of gorilla behaviour doesn\u2019t bear out such projections. Although male gorillas in the wild do exhibit aggressive behaviour and can even kill baby gorillas, more often when they are in groups, which sometimes contain several co-existing males, they are gentle and sociable.</p> <p>Primatologists like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2010/jun/27/jane-goodall-chimps-africa-interview\" title=\"\">Dian Fossey</a> observed that like any primate, ourselves included, gorillas respond aggressively to stress and threat but are largely peaceable. There are no recorded instances of \u201calpha-male\u201d behaviour including genital groping or chest thumping displays over the pricing of Marmite. In fact, the whole idea of the <a href=\"http://io9.gizmodo.com/why-everything-you-know-about-wolf-packs-is-wrong-502754629\" title=\"\">\u201calpha male\u201d</a> in nature \u2013 first popularised by Rudolph Schenkel in <a href=\"http://www.davemech.org/schenkel/index.html\" title=\"\">his study of wolves</a> \u2013 has long since been discredited.

This is anthropomorphism which projects certain human characteristics it wants to \u201cnaturalise\u201d on to the animals, in this instance male predatory sexual behaviour or business dominance and aggression. Aiming it at gorillas is not new. \u201cGorilla\u201d was, and still is occasionally, used in its more 19th-century way, as an insult implying bestial stupidity. Now, however, Farage\u2019s projections are typical. \u201cGorilla\u201d is used as a shorthand for aggressive, dominant male behaviour as this <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/800-pound_gorilla\" title=\"\">Wiki entry</a> makes clear: \u201c\u2018800lb gorilla\u2019 is an American English expression for a person or organisation so powerful that it can act without regard to the rights of others or the law.\u201d</p> <p>It is the sheer size of mature male gorillas (although the more accurate weight is 400lb, not 800) and the existence of one dominant male in groups which have allowed certain aggressive human males to project their preoccupations on to gorillas.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/14/london-zoo-gorilla-escape-kumbuka-wildlife-group-calls-for-inquiry\">London zoo denies gorilla escaped by smashing window</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But our understanding of their behaviour has also been distorted by natural history programmes with their \u201calpha-male\u201d preoccupations \u2013 and even more so by the existence of zoos. In confined enclosures and in small family groups, it\u2019s easy to form an impression of one huge male dominating his little family.</p> <p>Zoos are also highly stressful environments, making aggression a very real possibility. It\u2019s reported that visitors were banging on the windows of Kumbuka\u2019s enclosure before his escape. When keepers <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/01/cincinnati-zoo-gorilla-shooting-animal-conservation-experts\" title=\"\">decided to shoot silverback Harambe</a> earlier this year at Cincinnati zoo, visitors were screaming and shouting at him as he stood over the boy who had climbed into his pen. There are different opinions on whether the gorilla would have harmed the boy, but aggression is certainly a well-documented response to fear and stress.</p> <p>In the wild, male dominance is much less striking to primatologists; instead they witness complex, nuanced behaviour where interaction between mothers, and attention to the young is just as important for group cohesion. Howletts Wild Animal Park in Kent has larger enclosures and bigger groups of animals. It\u2019s still captivity but it permits a glimpse of wild gorilla behaviour where maternal attentiveness and group cooperation is just as defining of a gorilla\u2019s essential nature as the dominance behaviour of some males.</p> <p>There are, in short, just as strong grounds to call someone a gorilla if she\u2019s an attentive mother. But that wouldn\u2019t suit the likes of Farage, who seek not just to naturalise but to excuse certain types of human behaviour, making it seem as if treating women with contempt is something eternal and unchangeable. Maybe we should laugh it off. Except gorillas need all the help they can get at the moment and being associated with some of the least endearing examples of the human male is not good for their image.</p>",

Big smiley faces, slapstick, party tricks, bright colours; none of these things are typically associated with intense fear. And yet, when combined in the form of a clown, they regularly cause the exact opposite reaction to the one intended. Hence the term \u201c<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coulrophobia\">coulrophobia</a>\u201d, although this isn\u2019t an officially recognised phobia.

As a result, they have human bodies and faces, like everyone else.

It appears to be <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/8344203.stm\">a fundamental reflex</a>. Slap a pair of googly eyes on a sock and you\u2019ve got yourself a loveable puppet that nobody has any issue with, but a highly-realistic android with an almost-but-not-quite-identical face to that of a real human is <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNMbFlsLCkQ\">often very off-putting</a>. Ventriloquist dummies share a similar \u201cscary\u201d reputation to clowns, likely for this reason.</p> <p>One theory is that they make us think of death and corpses (a dead face looks like a normal one but \u201cbehaves\u201d differently) which should be avoided due to danger and risk of illness. But whatever the underlying cause, human faces that deviate from the norm are upsetting. And clown faces differ in <a href=\"https://static-s.aa-cdn.net/img/ios/915283307/859148822360ccd6a4a2950050047daf?v=1\">very elaborate ways</a>; the huge painted-on smiles, the crude colours, the greatly-exaggerated eyes, all of these and more combine to provide a recognisably-human face which doesn\u2019t behave as it should, which is very unsettling on a deep subconscious level. </p> <p>This is doubly true if the painted-on expression doesn\u2019t match the actual one. <a href=\"http://invibe.net/biblio_database_dyva/woda/data/att/c205.file.pdf\">The brain doesn\u2019t deal with such inconsistent stimulus very well</a>, which would cause further discomfort. </p> <p>It\u2019s not just the face; humans are very sensitive to body shape, and movement. We (again, subconsciously) glean <a href=\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/what-does-the-way-you-walk-say-about-you/\">an incredible amount of information just from the way someone walks</a>. Posture, stance, gait, we\u2019re sensitive to all this. Again, clowns throw all this out of whack, with their exaggerated tumbling and oversized shows. Combine all this with the incredible <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Michael_Dean3/publication/12507003_Configural_information_in_facial_expression_perception/links/004635228401040657000000.pdf\">human sensitivity to faces</a> and clowns often end up being upsetting just by their existence. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cd31173357df9115232491c98cb87e9569370472\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cd31173357df9115232491c98cb87e9569370472/0_2196_3456_2074/1000.jpg\" alt=\"(FILES) This file photo taken on December 03, 2012 shows French clown, comedian and filmmaker Pierre Etaix aka Yoyo posing his clown costume at the Bouglione circus in Chatou.

Lion tamers tame lions. Jugglers juggle. Acrobats perform impressive stunts. And clowns clown around. But that last bit isn\u2019t quite as predictable as the others. In a way, the whole point of clowns is that they do things which defy normal behaviour. <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3578277/\">Unpredictability is something which causes knee-jerk distrust and apprehension in humans</a>. The drunk on public transport, the homeless person yelling in the street, these figures are desperately avoided/ignored by those around them because they clearly aren\u2019t conforming to societal norms, and thus present a possible threat. </p> <p>This is even worse if we\u2019re in a social context, as clowns invariably are. <a href=\"http://www.social-anxiety.org.uk/\">Social anxieties</a> are among <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/brain-flapping/2014/oct/16/social-anxiety-mundane-terrifying-psychology-stress\">the most common in humans</a>, we genuinely fear being judged and mocked by others, whether we know them or not. Have you ever gone to a comedy gig and actively not sat in the front row? Most people do this, for fear of being spoken to and addressed, possibly ridiculed, by the comedian on stage.</p> <p>A comedian is just a person, but they still prove scary enough in the right context. Lump all the upsetting visual qualities of clowns on top, and you\u2019ve got a genuine and potent fear reaction.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"36612d00a80644dcef434acdcbbdcf7be9277306\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/36612d00a80644dcef434acdcbbdcf7be9277306/0_173_3200_1921/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A clown points a toy machine gun at another clown during celebrations on the International Day of the Clown in Cancun December 10, 2012.

All of the triggers for fearful reactions discussed above are still present when clowns are seen by children, but children, still figuring out the world, likely lack the required experience to explain away what they\u2019re seeing. An adult seeing a clown may think \u201cThese things are creepy, why do guys end up doing this?\u201d, whereas a child may be thinking \u201cWHATISSTHATWHATISTHATAAAAAAAAARGHHH!!!!\u201d</p> <p>Many lasting phobias <a href=\"http://www.phobics-society.org.uk/causes-of-phobias/\">stem from events that occurred during early childhood</a>.

  "<p>The first opposite-sex couple in the British Isles to go through a civil partnership ceremony have celebrated their union in Douglas, the capital of the Isle of Man.</p> <p>Adeline Cosson, 24, and Kieran Hodgson, 22, wanted to \u201ckeep it simple\u201d rather than have a traditional wedding. They are considering getting married at a later date.</p> <p>Civil partnerships, which were introduced in 2004 for same-sex couples following lobbying by equal rights campaigners, are not available for heterosexual partners in the UK.</p> <p>A London couple, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/dec/02/couple-challenge-ban-heterosexual-civil-partnerships\">Charles Keidan and Rebecca Steinfeld</a>, are going to the court of appeal in November to argue that denying opposite-sex couples civil partnerships breaches their human rights.</p> <p>But the Isle of Man, which is not part of the UK and decriminalised gay sex in the 1990s, made <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jul/21/same-sex-marriage-legal-isle-of-man\">civil partnerships available to everybody this summer</a>.</p> <p>Hodgson, who was born on the Wirral but brought up on the Isle of Man from the age of six, and Cosson, who is from central France, are the first couple to take advantage of the new legal freedom.</p> <p>The ceremony was held mid-morning on Friday at the registry office in Douglas. She wore a velvet dress; he chose a velvet jacket. \u201cWe didn\u2019t want to call it a marriage, we wanted to call it a civil partnership,\u201d said Cosson, who works in a cafe. \u201cWe were told we were the first ever. We are very proud to do it.<br></p> <p>\u201cThe main thing was that we wanted to keep it simple. We are a young couple. We do want to get married one day but not now; at a later date. This gives us rights under the law.<br></p> <p>\u201cIt helps couples move forward without having to get married right now. To create full equality on the Isle of Man, they have allowed gay couples to get married but also to start civil partnerships.\u201d</p> <p>She said she was surprised that the UK, which she had always regarded as adopting progressive policies, was denying most citizens the right to civil partnerships. \u201cIn France, everybody can get a civil partnership. A lot of people don\u2019t want to get married. \u2018Marriage\u2019 is a big word.</p> <p>\u201cI open doors [for men sometimes]. I believe in equality,\u201d she said. \u201cI live in my century.\u201d <br></p> <p>Hodgson, who is a healthcare assistant at an Isle of Man hospital, said: \u201cIt\u2019s a good idea.\u201d Rather than him dropping down on one knee and proposing, they had talked about the idea, he said. \u201cWe decided together to do it. It was a short discussion.\u201d <br></p> <p>The couple, who live in a flat in Douglas, held a celebration party with friends and family later on Friday. <br></p> <p>Jane Salter, the registrar who conducted the ceremony, said: \u201cThey are the first opposite-sex partners who have chosen a civil partnership. They were very happy and relaxed. It was just them and two witnesses.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s the same sort of ceremony as a wedding but we use different wording. We don\u2019t refer to the \u2018bride\u2019 and \u2018groom\u2019. They can exchange rings, but this couple didn\u2019t. They are now civil partners for life.\u201d</p> <p>Salter said she was due to hold another civil partnership next week for a couple travelling from London to take advantage of the island\u2019s more liberal laws. \u201cI could become a real expert. It could be good for tourism here,\u201d she said.<br></p> <p>Matt Hawkins, of the <a href=\"http://equalcivilpartnerships.org.uk/\">Equal Civil Partnerships Campaign</a>, said: \u201cI\u2019m delighted to send congratulations to Adeline and Kieran. I hope that the joy they share in their civil partnership is one that many different-sex couples across the British Isles will soon be able to experience.</p> <p>\u201cIt seems remarkable that different-sex couples in Britain are now just a stone\u2019s throw away from getting a civil partnership. Extending civil partnerships extends choice and gives couples who do not feel a marriage is right for them the chance to gain legal and financial protection for their relationship and, if they have any, their children. <br></p> <p>\u201cWith our 70,000 supporters, politicians backing us from every party, and endorsements from fantastic organisations, we are confident that that choice and opportunity will soon be extended and Adeline and Kieran\u2019s example followed by couples across Britain.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Many of the areas that have been recently marked as potential sites for fracking are rich in wildlife that perform crucial functions from pollination to decomposition, researchers have found.</p> <p>Scientists say that almost two-thirds of the areas that have been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/dec/17/fracking-uk-government-hands-out-new-licences\">labelled as suitable for shale gas extraction</a> have levels of biodiversity equal to or above the national average, according to a new analysis of records collected from across the country.</p> <p>\u201cA lot of the areas that have opened up to shale gas licensing actually harbour much higher than average levels of biodiversity,\u201d said Tom Oliver, of University of Reading who is a senior author of the <a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1365-2664.12784/abstract\">study</a> in the Journal of Applied Ecology. \u201cWe only have one natural heritage and we have to protect it and so using these data to highlight those very valuable sites and to facilitate their protection is hopefully a useful thing to do.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/13/british-public-support-for-fracking-sinks-to-lowest-ever-level\">British public support for fracking sinks to lowest ever level</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The study, which analysed previously collected records of more than 5,500 species, including those of birds, plants and butterflies, found that 65.3% of proposed areas that have been designated suitable for fracking have levels of biodiversity equal to or above the national average, including parts of Lancashire and South Wales.</p> <p>After dividing Britain up into squares, measuring 10km by 10km, the records, which were made by volunteers between 1970 and 2013, were assessed, taking into account the climate and geology of the area, as well as variations in the thoroughness of the recordings, thereby allowing different locations to be given a rating for their biodiversity, and compared to each other. The results are available to explore in an interactive <a href=\"https://eip.ceh.ac.uk/apps/ecostatus/\">digital map</a>.</p> <p>The scientists say the approach offers a new, fine-grained approach to looking at biodiversity across Britain. That, adds Oliver, will help, \u201cto inform the location of large infrastructure projects or ecological restoration work\u201d.</p> <p>The study also looked at how biodiversity had changed over time, focussing on changes between two time periods, 1970-1990 and 2000-2013. While in many areas the decline in the presence of protected species mirrored that of biodiversity more widely, in others that was not the case.</p> <p>\u201cThat wider biodiversity is still really important for a whole range of functions \u2013 pollination and pest control and decomposition \u2013 and also just the species that people really value seeing in the environment,\u201d said Oliver. \u201c[Priority species] are often used as indicators in these environmental assessments and we\u2019re showing that actually our new method allows us to incorporate a whole suite of other species, thousands of more common species, which are just as important really.\u201d</p> <p>The RSPB welcomed the research.<strong> </strong> \u201cThis is an important piece of research that uses the UKs wealth of biodiversity data collected by volunteers to add to our understanding of the risks that come with fracking.\u201d said Abi Bunker, the RSPB\u2019s head of policy and advocacy.<strong> \u201c</strong>The RSPB has long been concerned that fracking could pose risks to wildlife, and that\u2019s why we campaigned for and welcomed a Government ban on fracking in Sites of Special Scientific Interest and other designated areas in England and Wales. However, this new evidence shows that fracking could still put sensitive wildlife and habitats at risk and that stronger regulation is needed before fracking goes ahead.\u201d</p> <p>A spokesperson from the<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-business-energy-and-industrial-strategy\"> Department for Business, Energy &amp; Industrial Strategy said</a>: \u201cWe have more than 50 years of drilling experience in the UK and one of the best records in the world for economic development while protecting our environment and the public.</p> <p>\u201cAny company that wants to carry out fracking must conduct an assessment of the impact on the environment and habitats, and earlier this year we brought in extra protections so that fracking could not take place in a number of protected areas that are home to wildlife.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>On 15 October 1966 Huey P Newton and Bobby Seale founded the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/sep/03/black-panthers-vanguard-revolution-film\" title=\"\">Black Panther Party for Self-Defense</a> in Oakland, California. The Panthers quickly became one of the most important and well-known black radical organisations, inspiring chapters across the US and around the world. Fifty years on, the legacy of the Panthers is particularly important given the resurgence of black political action and the rise of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/black-lives-matter-movement\" title=\"\">Black Lives Matter</a> on both sides of the Atlantic. The Panthers are largely remembered for their gun-toting public displays and revolutionary rhetoric; but the true legacy of the party is the grassroots community activism that defined them.</p> <p>The image of the Panthers marching into the state capitol building in California armed with shotguns, in 1967, shocked America to the same degree it inspired black communities. The Panthers believed in armed self-defence and \u201cpatrolled\u201d the police, observing them during stops in black communities. This, unsurprisingly, led to confrontations, shootouts and arrests, as well as high-profile trials against Panthers including Newton. The campaigns to free the Panthers and raise money for legal defence are the basis of the collective memory of the party. However, the reality of their work was not these direct and sometimes symbolic confrontations.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>One of the first successes of the Panthers was to get a traffic light put up where children had been knocked down</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The main work of the Panthers was in coordinating \u201csurvival programmes\u201d that offered support to poor African-Americans that the state would not. The \u201cfree breakfast for schools\u201d programme was feeding 20,000 children a day at its peak; the free health clinics treated tens of thousands of people; and they also started their own \u201cliberation schools\u201d to counter racist schooling. It was this community organising that embedded the Panthers in the community, not the guns and shootouts. One of the first successes of the Panthers was campaigning to get a traffic light put up on a busy intersection in Oakland, where children had been knocked down. The main lessons for organisations as they develop in Britain is that activism is not judged by big showpieces that gain media attention; but the mundane organising that organically links movements to the communities they are trying to serve.</p> <p>In Britain there is a rich historical legacy to draw upon, which has largely been forgotten. The British Black Panthers started in 1968 and included people like Dr Althea Jones-Lecointe, Olive Morris and <a href=\"http://www.vice.com/en_uk/read/neil-kenlocks-photos-give-the-british-black-panthers-the-legacy-they-deserve\" title=\"\">photographer-in-chief Neil Kenlock</a>. The British Panthers did not condone gun use and focused on community education and anti-racist campaigns. They are part of a lost legacy of black radical activism that has strong roots in Britain. As new movements develop it is important to make connections and draw lessons from what has gone before.</p> <p>Contrary to popular mythology, the Panthers in America were 60% female and featured prominent roles for women. This was particularly true in the British movement, which had strong female leadership and groups that sprang out of it such as the Black Women\u2019s Group in 1973. Black women have been erased from the narrative of black activism and it is important we rediscover that history.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2008/oct/28/emory-douglas-black-panther\">The revolutionary art of Emory Douglas, Black Panther</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Panthers have also helped sustain today\u2019s movements. Their first creative fundraising activity was to sell copies of Mao\u2019s Little Red Book to college students, and they published the Black Panther newspaper, which sold for 10 cents per copy with a peak circulation of 250,000 a week. The Panthers also raised funds from white allies and the state, but they understood that a movement cannot be independent unless it can raise its own funds. Whoever finances a group owns the organisation and this will be key as movements progress in Britain.</p> <p>The newspaper was important in disseminating the political messages of the party. Mass circulation meant they had reach beyond their membership in black communities. Emory Douglas\u2019s artwork was the perfect vehicle for spreading the ideas of the Panthers, for instance his iconic depiction of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2008/oct/28/emory-douglas-black-panther\" title=\"\">the police as pigs</a>. Black Lives Matter has harnessed the power of social media, but this cannot replace the physical paper, which reaches the places the internet cannot. The presence of the Panthers selling the paper and engaging with the community was also important to embedding the movement at the grassroots. The revolution will not be retweeted, it will be led from the ground up by the communities who need it most.</p> <p>The overt confrontations with police led to the Panthers being financially drained by legal fees and brutally assaulted by the state. This unfortunately led to the downfall of the movement and detracted from the grassroots activism the Panthers were leading. Today\u2019s movements should remember that high-profile confrontations do not sustain an organisation, the first goal must be to root the struggle in the daily lives of black communities.</p>",
  "<p>Yet another report has been published showing frightening levels of mental illness among children and young people in England. The figure now stands at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/oct/03/quarter-of-a-million-children-receiving-mental-health-care-in-england\" title=\"\">about a&#xa0;quarter of a million</a>. I have written before, downplaying the phenomenon, usually along the lines of \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/mar/27/we-oldies-arent-lucky-ones-children-today-have-much-better-lives\" title=\"\">children have never had it so good</a>\u201d and pointing to the increase in child-centrism, the boons of technology and the growth in living standards for most.</p> <p>I can\u2019t keep my head in the sand any longer. Something is going seriously wrong. Owen Jones, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/04/ashamed-britain-children-intolerable-pressures-mental-health-problems\" title=\"\">in an article in this newspaper</a>, recited the usual suspects \u2013 overcrowded and poor housing, poor diet, lack of exercise, family conflict, the stresses of poverty and lack of state support. I am dubious about most of these explanations, largely because such matters have long been with us without an accompanying crisis of mental illness.</p> <p>My explanation is that our children are having their childhood stolen from them, and at some level they know it. They kick against this with rage and frustration. But it is important to note that this is a rise in mental illness, not unhappiness. They are different things. Mental illness is an unhappiness that is unsanctioned, denied essentially. It is unhappiness that does not know itself. It is unhappiness that arises from confusion and double standards. Why this confusion? Chiefly, it is down to the idea that achievement and competition are all important. There is nothing wrong with this as an ethos, but achievement of what? Competition for what? And when does it end?</p> <p>In the world I grew up in, when mental illness among young people was largely unheard of, achievement, although desirable, was not considered particularly important. Many people from my very ordinary background didn\u2019t pass any important exams. Few went to university. And it wasn\u2019t thought a big deal, because it was recognised that not everyone could be outstanding or high achieving. It wasn\u2019t a failure to get a job in a local shop or factory, find somewhere OK to live and have a couple of kids. It was normal and many people embraced it.</p> <p>But things have changed in the world of societal expectation. The myth seems to have arisen that individual striving and effort will always get you what you want \u2013 money, status or a satisfying career. A few generations ago, we were more realistic. The class structure of society, and our own individual limitations \u2013 such things were acknowledged then \u2013&#xa0;meant that few of us could hope to hit&#xa0;the heights. But it didn\u2019t matter as long as we had a reasonable job, our community, our homes, our families. Expectations were in line with reality.</p> <p>Now that middle-class aspirational values have seeped and bled everywhere, this is no longer the case. Not only are we told that we can do anything if we want to, but that we should. We must all become middle class, or count ourselves a failure. Competitive narcissism runs rampant.</p> <p>It is bad enough for those who come from a background that invests in this \u2013 the ambitious middle class. To get sucked in from a culture that does not invest in it, or have much of a chance in the race \u2013 well, no wonder some children are either rejecting education, or experiencing mental illnesses.</p> <p>Achievement is healthy, but we don\u2019t all have to hit the heights to feel good about ourselves. Society is made up of mostly low- or medium-achievers, and to make us feel ashamed of who we are is a great burden. Success should be redefined as achieving what you feel capable of, and what lies within the realm of possibility \u2013 not what society tells you that you must achieve in order to conform to a fantasy that, for most, only exists in glossy magazines and university prospectuses.</p> <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/timlottwriter\" title=\"\"><em>@timlottwriter</em></a></p>",

  "<p>John Bird painted a grim picture of the UK with a reduced library service, warning the House of Lords on Thursday that cuts would result in \u201cdisorder, crime, problems for schools and the fact that children will not be able to get a job because they will not have the skills and abilities\u201d.</p> <p>Opening a debate on libraries, bookshops and booksellers, the Big Issue founder told the house that \u201cwe have lost more than 500 [libraries] since 2010\u201d, and almost 9,000 librarians. Describing the UK\u2019s public library service as essential, he called on the government to \u201csupply some emergency relief money to stop local authorities doing this dastardly deed, this process of philistinising our communities\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWhen government departments cut budgets in one particular area, it tends to find a manifestation in another area,\u201d Lord Bird said. \u201cFor instance, if you start cutting the number of libraries \u2013 we have lost more than 500 since 2010 \u2013 you are building up a bill that will occur in another part of government. It will be shifted into disorder, crime, problems for schools and the fact that children will not be able to get a job because they will not have the skills and abilities. So if you wish to cut libraries, please do so \u2013 but do it on the basis that you build more prisons and more hostels for homeless people and put higher walls around your house.\u201d</p> <p>His views were backed by a host of other members, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/gailrebuck\">Gail Rebuck</a>, chair of Penguin Random House and a Labour peer, who said that \u201cour trajectory towards one library per 50,000 people is simply a disaster\u201d. </p> <p>\u201cWe have a stark choice,\u201d Baroness Rebuck said. \u201cIf we lose our celebrated bookshops and libraries we will never improve our nation\u2019s literacy.

The Chartered Institute of Library and Information Professionals (Cilip), has asked the government to act, suggesting that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/dec/17/librarians-take-legal-fight-against-library-closures-to-government\">further library closures could be against the law</a>.</p> <p>In response, Lord Ashton, the parliamentary under-secretary of state for culture, media and sport, told the House of Lords that secretaries of state take their power to intervene in a local authority\u2019s decision to close libraries by directing a local inquiry \u201cseriously, and carefully consider complaints that are lodged\u201d.</p> <p>Ashton said that Collins \u201cwas right to say that the power of inquiry has been used only once in the past 52 years \u2013 in the Wirral in 2009, under a Labour government \u2013 but, in answer to his question, the Department for Culture, Media and Sport has investigated 11 complaints raised in respect of a number of library authorities in recent years\u201d. He added: \u201cThe secretary of state at the time of each of these previous complaints decided not to order a local inquiry.\u201d</p> <p>He added that the DCMS \u201cis currently investigating four further complaints relating to Harrow, Southampton, Lambeth and Lancashire\u201d, where closures are either planned or under way, and that \u201cif there is serious doubt that the library service provided by a local authority offers a comprehensive and efficient service, this government will not hesitate to order an inquiry\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cLibraries, bookshops and booksellers contribute enormously to the civic, cultural and educational wellbeing of this country. I think that we all agree that access to books is vital,\u201d said Ashton. \u201cThe government recognises the value of libraries in providing a range of activities to their local communities.\u201d</p> <p>But according to Cilip\u2019s chief executive, Nick Poole, the government\u2019s response in the debate was \u201cconfused and inadequate with no clear leadership or action\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cAs we go into [the] autumn statement facing new levels of cuts, it is vital that local authorities recognise that taking library services away piles costs elsewhere in the system,\u201d Poole said. \u201cAll eyes will be on libraries minister Rob Wilson ... to come out with a robust plan and relief for public libraries.\u201d</p>",

However, instead of inducing cheers of approval, this change has been vilified by a series of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/feb/04/e-cigarettes-toxic-chemicals-research-finds-lung-damage\" title=\"\">scare stories</a>. Much of this disapproval has come from a vocal few who, unable to find flaws in emerging evidence of the health benefits of switching to vaping from cigarette smoking, have begun to attack those who work in this field.</p> <p>There are regular claims that conflicts of interest have corrupted the evidence, and it has been suggested that scientists should not work with, or even talk to, the tobacco industry about developing vaping devices. Yet it was these scientists who pioneered the very technology that the industry is now adopting. If we believe vaping saves lives, then we should be encouraging the tobacco industry to pay attention.</p> <p>There are complex reasons why some public health experts are so mistrustful. In part it reflects the concern we all share that industry puts profits over truth. The tobacco industry is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2004/sep/26/smoking.publichealth\" title=\"\">particularly problematic</a> as we know it lied over the harmfulness and addictiveness of tobacco, so why wouldn\u2019t they continue to lie about these new products? The way to deal with this concern is not to ignore tobacco companies completely, but to make them better by using the approach we take for the pharmaceutical industry: hold them to account and make sure they are fully transparent with their product claims and research data.</p> <p>Another commonly heard concern is that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/apr/28/doctors-warn-big-tobacco-firms-e-cigarette-market-rcp-industry\" title=\"\">tobacco companies are encouraging vaping</a> so that they can get young people addicted to nicotine and then take up cigarette smoking. This tactic seems unlikely to succeed, particularly as most young vapers don\u2019t even vape nicotine-containing fluids, preferring nicotine-free flavours such as strawberry cake and pear drops. In fact, data suggests that vaping is almost certainly the reason why cigarette smoking in young people has reached an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/sep/20/number-of-uk-smokers-falls-to-lowest-level\" title=\"\">all-time low</a>.</p> <p>Some people are concerned that the tobacco industry\u2019s interest in vaping is a front to get the products so tightly regulated that only they will have the financial power to comply with all the testing required. This may actually sadly be the outcome in the USA, where the new US food and drug administration rules will make it almost impossible for small vaping companies to continue to trade. In the UK, there is a chance to avoid this monopoly by using Brexit to reject the planned European regulations.</p> <p>The more suspicious members of the public health community think that once the tobacco industry achieves a monopoly it will stop selling vaping products in a bid to re-energise the cigarette market. This has already happened in some countries such as Malaysia and India, but is an unlikely scenario in the UK, as vaping has already developed into a vast business. Furthermore, if we decide we want to we could prevent tobacco companies from doing this by law, in the same way that regulations in the UK insist that low-alcohol products must be available wherever alcohol is sold.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/feb/19/nicotine-poison-e-cigarettes-evidence\">Don\u2019t fall for the hype. Nicotine is a poison, no matter how it is delivered | Nash Riggins</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Added to this entire debate are the more subtle psychological issues that surround decision-making in health. There are some public health leaders who feel vaping only brings harm, so they seek to remove it in any form. They deny there are any benefits but most people, particularly pleasure vapers, would disagree.</p> <p>Finally, anti-tobacco health campaigners know that banning cigarettes is impossible. Indeed, in the US federal law has guaranteed the perpetual right of tobacco companies to sell cigarettes \u2013 they cannot be directly attacked. Thus the anti-tobacco groups have focused their efforts to ban a less-established and less well-funded alternative: vaping. Imagine if we end up allowing smoking to continue, while banning a much less harmful alternative that could <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/sep/13/electronic-cigarettes-can-help-smokers-quit-says-study\" title=\"\">help some people to quit</a>.</p> <p>It is reassuring that the oversight body for public health in England has concluded from its own assessment that switching from cigarettes to vaping will be a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/aug/19/public-health-england-e-cigarettes-safer-than-smoking\" title=\"\">major benefit to public health</a>. Some authorities, such as in Wales, are already using vaping as a tool to get smokers off cigarettes. This technology could mean huge wins in cutting down cancer and heart disease, and in time the evidence will surely convince even vaping\u2019s most ardent opponents. Until then, we must not let hypothetical concerns about vaping limit its use, or we shall never gain adequate evidence of its true value in our fight against the clear and present danger of cigarettes.</p>",

  "<p>The comt\u00e9 cheese souffle encapsulates my region, my terroir, my home \u2013 it is the defining dish of the whole region of Franche-Comt\u00e9.</p> <p>When I was a child, we\u2019d take our two-litre pot to fetch fresh milk from the fromagerie, an immense room tiled with white and furnished with huge copper vats. The taste of sweet fresh milk is an enduring memory, as is that of the comt\u00e9 being made. I loved watching the fromagers \u2013 cheesemakers \u2013 in their white plastic aprons, scooping milk solids from the bottom of this six-metre wide vat \u2013 about 300 litres of milk \u2013 and lifting out the curd with a mousseline net, maybe 150kg of it. They\u2019d divide the curd on to huge wheels of wood then press it. It was mesmerising.</p> <p>Comt\u00e9 is used in hundreds of Franche-Comtois recipes \u2013 raclette, quenelles \u2026 and this souffle, which was always one of my mother\u2019s staples. I come from a working-class family. My mother made delicious food in vast quantities \u2013 she had five kids to feed! Meat only twice a week, lots of pulses, and lots of cheese.</p> <p>We usually ate in the kitchen, except for Sundays when the whole clan would descend and we\u2019d all eat in the dining room. It was very regimented \u2013 French children were highly disciplined at the table. My dad was in charge \u2013 we\u2019d wait for him. There\u2019d be a big 2kg loaf of bread that only he could serve, because he had earned it. Before slicing it, he\u2019d do a cross on the bottom of the bread \u2013 a nice way to show his respect.</p> <p>More than just food, my childhood gave me a complete philosophy about eating. We had a relatively small garden, which I was always weeding, watering or tidying, while my friends were playing football! I didn\u2019t hold it close to my heart then, but now I know it\u2019s where I learned everything about varietals. My mother would never just say \u201cget me some potatoes\u201d. We\u2019d go foraging in the forest for berries, mushrooms and wild asparagus, which gave me an understanding of seasonality, of variety, of food being so much more than simply sustenance. It was about being connected to both family and the environment. It was about authenticity.</p> <h2><strong>Souffle franc-comtois</strong></h2> <p>The souffle base can be prepared a day in advance and kept in the fridge, the surface covered with buttered greaseproof paper to avoid crusting. You need to have everyone seated and ready to eat when you take the dish from the oven \u2013 even a perfectly cooked souffle will stay inflated for only around 5 minutes. Montgomery cheddar or gruyere could be substituted for the comt\u00e9. You might like to put a layer of cooked Swiss chard, leeks or Belgian endive into the bottom of the dish.</p> <p><strong>Serves 6</strong><br>20g unsalted butter, melted<br>20g dried coarse breadcrumbs<br>7 organic/free-range medium egg whites (210g)<br>4 drops of lemon juice<br>20g comt\u00e9 cheese, finely grated</p> <p><strong> For the base</strong><br>50g unsalted butter<br>50g plain flour<br>300ml whole milk, hot<br>160g comt\u00e9 cheese, finely grated<br>20g dijon mustard<br>3 organic/free-rangemedium egg yolks (60g)<br>Salt and white pepper</p> <p><strong> For the sauce</strong><br>150ml double cream<br>70g comt\u00e9 cheese, grated<br>1 tsp dijon mustard<br>A pinch of white pepper<br>1 tbsp <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirsch\">kirsch</a></p> <p>1 Preheat the oven to 170C/335F/gas mark 3\u00bd and put a baking tray (or stone) on the middle shelf to heat up; a baking stone, if you have one, would be even better. Meanwhile, using a pastry brush, brush a large round or oval earthenware dish with a thin, even layer of melted butter and coat with the dried breadcrumbs. This coating will help the souffle to rise evenly in the oven and give it a beautiful crust. Set aside.</p> <p>2 For the souffle base, melt the butter in a large saucepan (ideally one with rounded sides) over a medium heat. Add the flour and whisk until smooth. Cook to a nutty-coloured blond roux. Lower the heat. Whisk in the hot milk, little by little, it should be smooth. Add the grated cheese and mustard. Cook for 2\u20133 minutes, whisking now and then. Remove the pan from the heat. Let it cool a little.</p> <p>3 Add the yolks. Stir until the mixture is silky smooth.

One person\u2019s troll is another person trying to make a point. They\u2019re trying to get you to listen to an argument. I don\u2019t make sweeping statements on social media, mainly because I can\u2019t be fucking arsed with the argument that follows. I remember going on there and slagging off Formula One. \u201cIt\u2019s just cars going round and round\u2026\u201d I knew that would annoy them; it was me trolling them, really. But quickly the fun dissipated from that and it just became horrible. People were just angry.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-vAp9n8rQc\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/I-vAp9n8rQc?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Black Mirror: official trailer for series three.</figcaption> </figure>   <h2>Hacking</h2> <p>Is hacking ever acceptable? It depends on the motive. 2600: The Hacker Quarterly offered $10k to whoever got them <a href=\"http://www.satiratribune.com/2016/09/08/wikileaks-hacks-donald-trumps-tax-returns/\">Donald Trump\u2019s tax details</a>. It\u2019s a new thing to worry about. What would be the equivalent of that for most people? Someone reading your diaries. Something reading your innermost thoughts. That\u2019s the fear isn\u2019t it? But you get people who do it with a view to exposing a security flaw and alerting the company involved. So it can be worthwhile: you find a flaw in iCloud, you tell Apple and they fix it. And they give you a job and fire a hose of gold coins at you. Can we fix it? I don\u2019t think we ever can. It has been regulated against. That\u2019s the point: hackers ignore regulation. Things might possibly go full-circle. We\u2019ll resort to Post-it notes. Isn\u2019t that the plot of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2009/mar/19/battlestar-galactica-review\">rebooted Battlestar Galactica</a>? It survives because it\u2019s not online. We\u2019ll go back to smoke signals, carrier pigeons and those ravens they use in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/series/game-of-thrones-episode-by-episode\">Game Of Thrones</a>.</p> <h2>Online dating</h2> <p>Tinder is the ultimate gamification of romance. It\u2019s Pok\u00e9mon GO for the heart. It\u2019s basically what\u2019s destroying the club scene. People used to go to nightclubs to meet people, but the middle man\u2019s been cut out. The only people who still go to clubs now are people who actually like clubs. Which, as it turns out, is not a big enough subset to keep the clubs viable. The reports I hear about Tinder are that it puts you in a constant pattern of thinking there\u2019s something better round the corner. And as we all know in life\u2026 there never is.</p> <h2>Artificial intelligence</h2> <p>Google Allo is a messaging app that fills in your conversation for you in your style. It\u2019s basically an episode we did called Be Right Back [where a bereaved woman clones her dead partner from his social media profile]. I read a thing where two people put them on autopilot; they\u2019re having a conversation [with each other], and they\u2019re not even there. God knows where that\u2019s going to go; what if they fall in love? You take a computer for granted. Then, when you get the spinning beach ball or the Wi-Fi goes down it\u2019s like \u201cFor fuck\u2019s sake!\u201d You scream and shout at them. I\u2019ve read about a device that remembers all the times you\u2019ve shouted at it and gives you fucking payback.

Now the first thing I do is that [reaches for iPhone]. In 30 years\u2019 time there will be a drama series set in 2016. Characters will be on their phones and the viewers will look at it like we do with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/apr/09/the-10-best-mad-men-characters\">Mad Men</a> and smoking: \u201cLook at them! They\u2019re all on their phones in meetings! Well, of course, they didn\u2019t know about the thumb cancer those things give you\u2026\u201d Having said that, I remember life before smartphones, and it was fucking boring. The most exciting thing you could do was get a cover for your phone, or play Snake. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll replace them until we get in-eye contact lenses that do the same thing; so we can stare at people while we\u2019re ignoring them. We should try and make people more interesting than phones.</p> <h2>Big Data</h2> <p>I must have been a recipient of this: Netflix must have looked at their data on who was watching the first two seasons of Black Mirror and thought \u201cwe\u2019ll have some of that\u201d. It can be slightly eerie. When you\u2019re browsing online for sheds, two hours later you\u2019re looking up something else\u2026 and there\u2019s shed adverts being thrown at you. They shouldn\u2019t do that \u2013 it feels creepy. It\u2019s like when you mentioned to your grandmother ten years ago that you quite liked riding your bike so she keeps getting you Tour De France books. It\u2019s not self-aware yet, it doesn\u2019t know it\u2019s becoming annoying. But when you put on Spotify Discover Weekly, it\u2019s based on the sort of thing you like.

  "<p>David Lodge, who this year turned 81, is having a late look round his estate. In 2015 he published a memoir covering the first 40 years of his life, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jan/16/quite-a-good-time-to-be-born-by-david-lodge-review\" title=\"\"><em>Quite a Good Time&#xa0;to Be Born</em></a>, and now he\u2019s swept together half a dozen short stories written between 1955 and the early 90s and added a couple of more recent pieces, so that his admirers can form a view of his short fiction alongside the novels and literary criticism on which his reputation rests.</p> <p>Actually his most die-hard fans have been able to do this for a while, since the older stories collected here were widely published across mainland Europe in translation during the mid 90s, and in the UK in a limited edition by the Bridgewater Press in 1998. It seems likely that things might have stayed like that, had the French edition of the book not provoked an unexpected reaction in a reader. Philippine Hamen, a furniture designer, was so taken by the story \u201cThe Man Who Wouldn\u2019t Get Up\u201d that she designed a&#xa0;hybrid piece \u201cthat would allow the narrator to virtually stay in bed while being able to still work\u201d. Lodge, when he heard about it, was delighted and <a href=\"https://ikon-gallery.org/event/for-the-man-who-wouldnt-get-up-homage-to-david-lodge/\" title=\"\">brought it to the attention of the Ikon Gallery in Birmingham</a>, of which he and his wife are patrons. When Lodge\u2019s&#xa0;agent heard about this, he in turn suggested the present book to&#xa0;Vintage.</p> <p>All of which amounts to something like a short story itself, with its own amusing charm. In the main part of the&#xa0;book, however, things are less responsive to life\u2019s twists and turns. This is not quite to suggest that Lodge keeps an iron grip on his imagination. But it is to say that his short fictions are very modest in scope \u2013 despite the rather grandiose allusions he makes in an afterword, regarding their \u201cinter-textuality\u201d. They all have an easily comprehended narrative structure, an&#xa0;affably middle-brow tone, an uncomplicated sense of their time and&#xa0;place, and a clear moral (if not quite moralising) and intellectual framework. And&#xa0;they are all, in one way or another,&#xa0;about the same thing. Namely,&#xa0;the way in which people discover and react to the limitations that govern their lives.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/sep/20/lost-in-a-pyramid-andrew-smith-mummy-stories-louisa-m-alcott-conan-doyle-shelf-life-rachel-cooke\">Tales from the tomb</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In the title story the narrator, George, is depressed by \u201cthe combined weight of dissatisfaction with his environment and despair of ever significantly improving it\u201d, so rebelliously refuses to get out of bed. Implausibly enough, this makes him a minor celebrity in the wider world (a TV crew films him, as a result of which he gets a \u201cdeluge\u201d of mail: really?). At first his wife resents him, then respects him \u201cmore than ever before\u201d. But neither is&#xa0;any kind of cure for his mood. Although the first version of the story (Lodge tells us in the afterword) ended with the revelation that George\u2019s bed-lying was \u201cjust a dream\u201d, in this final version death comes to George \u201cin the form of the drab physical environment with which he had begun his withdrawal from life\u201d.</p> <p>The limits described in this story, in other words, are determined by things-as-they-are: by having to live in real time, surrounded by reality\u2019s hard truths. More partial and therefore slighter versions of the same point occur in the next two stories. One features a small boy who discovers that&#xa0;providence does not always produce reliable rewards, and the other&#xa0;offers a little parable of \u201chow capitalism exploits the workers\u201d.</p> <p>In the remaining six stories, Lodge applies his law of limitation to the relations between men and women. In settings which range from Ibiza in 1955 to a dramatic monologue that updates Browning\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems-and-poets/poems/detail/43768\" title=\"\">\u201cMy Last Duchess\u201d</a> , we meet a cast of men who are generally clumsy in their innocence, rigid in their assumptions, and prurient in their tastes (we get to hear about an awful lot of \u201cboobs\u201d). Much the same goes for the women, who are prissy, know-all, inept, bossy, money-grubbing and selfish. Emma, the bride-to-be in the final and most recent story in the book, \u201cA Wedding to Remember\u201d, is all these together. After rolling out plans for an extravagant wedding to a man too gutless to resist her, and then discovering he\u2019s unfaithful and no longer wants to get married, she hooks up instead with a \u201cconceptual poet\u201d whose masterwork is \u201ca transcription of the satnav instructions for a journey from Land\u2019s End to John O\u2019Groats\u201d.</p> <p>Limits, again. Emma can\u2019t accept the frustration of her plans, and adapts them to survive, just as the heroes and heroines of the previous couple-stories also adapt to survive \u2013 and might therefore seem to be models of empowerment. Yet the mood and message of the stories has very little to do with liberation. On the contrary, even when they are preoccupied by the change in sexual mores that occurred in the 60s, as many of them are, Lodge\u2019s characters seem unable to escape a blighted Larkinland where everyone is more or less deceived. Their language retains the beige tint of the mid-century. Their grasp of selfhood is never firm or convincing. It means the book as a whole has a distinctly old-fashioned feel, but also contains an element of bleakness that never goes out of date.</p> <p>\u2022&#xa0;<em>The Man Who Wouldn\u2019t Get Up and Other Stories</em>&#xa0;is published by Vintage.

  "<p>For university students around the country, freshers\u2019 week has just come to a close. Traditionally associated with frenzied socialising and drinking, in recent years it has become notable for another fixture: sexual consent workshops. And this new term saw yet another protest led by a male student <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/student/news/sexual-consent-classes-walkout-student-protest-york-university-workshops-a7338106.html\" title=\"\">arguing</a> that such classes were patronising and unnecessary.</p> <p>These protesters couldn\u2019t be more wrong. As a criminal law lecturer at Oxford and a campaigner who has facilitated consent workshops, I am disturbed by common and persistent misunderstandings of sexual consent. As a victim of rape myself, who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/mar/29/raped-university-police-reaction-urgent-change\" title=\"\">shares my story openly</a>, I have come to expect sceptical responses. If you heard my story, you might say, along with many others, \u201cthat\u2019s just sex with regrets\u201d but both legally and psychologically, you would be wrong.</p> <p>So, during freshers\u2019 week this year, I decided to challenge misconceptions of rape by staging a recreation of the immediate aftermath of my own violation, inviting people to come to see for themselves what rape looks like. In my story, would they be able to identify sexual violence, or would they just see an ordinary sexual interaction?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/oct/13/reported-rapes-in-england-and-wales-double-in-five-years\">Reported rapes in England and Wales double in five years</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A better awareness of what constitutes rape is urgently needed. Figures <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/oct/13/reported-rapes-in-england-and-wales-double-in-five-years\" title=\"\">published on Thursday</a> show that the reporting of rapes in the UK has doubled over the past four years \u2013 which is thought to be an impact of high-profile cases such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/jimmy-savile\" title=\"\">Jimmy Savile</a> \u2013 but also that the conviction rate has fallen in this time. Suggesting a reason for this, professor Liz Kelly of London Metropolitan University, commented: \u201cThere is a whole set of social assumptions about what a rape looks like, which most rapes don\u2019t look like.\u201d</p> <p>My performance took place in student accommodation at the University of Oxford, just as my rape had done. Upon arrival, attendees were chaperoned into the building and invited to enter a bedroom. On entering the bedroom, the attendees found the curtains were drawn and the scene was lit by a single bedside lamp. In the bed I was lying on my side, in the arms of a male performer who held me against his body. This was the position I found myself in when I woke up that morning. I remember feeling confused and not knowing where I was, while also, disturbingly, enjoying being held. I was in shock.</p> <p>Finding myself again in this position, five years later, I felt something quite different. As I recalled my rape, and experienced being viewed by others in a moment of such vulnerability, I cried and shook. I felt the shame that is so common among victims of sexual offences; the acute fear that those I was sharing this experience with would dismiss my story as many had done so before. I felt the gut-level pain of recognising what had been done to me. I lay in the bed for an hour and a half, as 20 students, some known to me and some strangers, came to view my rape scene.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f7c33969f020d76a54018fc2f3f739157c1b8021\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f7c33969f020d76a54018fc2f3f739157c1b8021/0_0_850_651/500.jpg\" alt=\"Former Stanford student Brock Turner\" width=\"500\" height=\"383\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018in the coverage of Brock Turner\u2019s crime at Stanford University, much was made of the fact the assault took place behind a dumpster, among dirt and pine-needles.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>My performance was inspired by the 1973 art work by Ana Mendieta, <a href=\"http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/mendieta-untitled-rape-scene-t13355/text-summary\" title=\"\">Untitled (Rape Scene)</a>, in which Mendieta reenacted the aftermath of a rape and murder that had occurred on her campus. The scene set was harrowing: Mendieta, nude from the waist down, bound to a kitchen table and smeared with blood.</p> <p>While important in its time, I was troubled by the thought that this rape scene, like so many others portrayed in the media, was overtly violent. There is generally something shocking about those cases of rape we are exposed to, which signals to us that indeed this is an instance of sexual violence. For example, in the coverage of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/01/brock-turner-stanford-assault-case-did-anything-change\" title=\"\">Brock Turner\u2019s crime at Stanford University</a>, much was made of the fact the sexual assault took place behind a dumpster, among dirt and pine-needles, with the victim being publicly exposed and suffering physical injuries. I couldn\u2019t help but wonder if the case would have received the same coverage if Turner had taken his victim back to his accommodation, and assaulted her in his own bed, without inflicting physical injury.</p> <p>After all, that is precisely what had happened to me. And, despite the law, which makes it clear that it is rape when someone has sex with a person who is incapacitated through intoxication, to many people my story was a bad one-night stand and therefore my fault. Even the police, when I first reported it, said that no crime had been committed. It was only when I complained they acknowledged I had reported a rape and offered to reopen the case.</p> <p>Why the confusion? Perhaps, because what happened to me looks normal. There is nothing to shock or to excite, even to titillate. Those who attended my performance found a scene that was in many ways utterly mundane, having braced themselves for something visceral and confronting. That was the point. The very banality of my rape scene was meant to shock, and it did.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/mar/29/raped-university-police-reaction-urgent-change\">When I was raped as a student, the police barely helped \u2013 and nor did the university | Alive Irving</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In a discussion after the performance, attendees expressed feeling acute discomfort upon viewing a normal private space, and realising that it could be the site of such violence. They were struck by how violence could take such a different form than that which they normally imagined. There was speculation that perhaps we don\u2019t believe stories of rape of this sort, because we don\u2019t want to believe people are capable of such things. But my performance made it impossible for attendees to disbelieve, forcing them to recognise that sexual interactions that are often dismissed as normal are too often instances of sexual violence.</p> <p>These misconceptions about rape show why consent workshops in universities are crucial: to ensure that people really understand what sexual violence is. These workshops must continue. So too must journalism casting light on the realities of sexual violence on campuses, such as the recent Guardian coverage of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/oct/07/scale-of-sexual-abuse-in-uk-universities-likened-to-savile-and-catholic-scandals\" title=\"\">sexual assault and harassment perpetrated by staff against students</a>.

  "<p>Lav Diaz\u2019s The Woman Who Left is a vast, dark behemoth of mystery and anguish, as forbidding as a starless night sky.

Diaz works on the movie equivalent of geological time. His movie has no closeups \u2013 there is just one medium shot of his heroine \u2013 and it is strange to come to the end of such a long movie with only a hazy idea, or none at all, of what the characters actually look like. It is in austere monochrome, made even more daunting by Diaz\u2019s love of darkness in all senses \u2013 his unhurried, unlit sequences are something to compare with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/sep/17/pedro-costa-director-horse-money-cavalo-dinheiro-gil-scott-heron-interview\">Pedro Costa\u2019s sepulchral images</a> of Fontainhas in Lisbon or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/may/07/stray-dogs-review-tsai-ming-liang-uncompromising\">Tsai Ming-liang</a>\u2019s street scenes.

(By the end, it reminded me more of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Father_Sergius\">Father Sergius</a>.) </p> <p>In Tolstoy\u2019s story, a merchant grows old in prison, having been wrongly convicted of murder as a young man; a middle-aged criminal arrives, boasting of his life of wrongdoing, and from the details, the old man realises that he is the actual culprit. </p> <p>Diaz takes the idea on from its endpoint: it is 1997, radio news reports announce it to be the era of the Hong Kong handover and the deaths of Princess Diana and Mother Teresa. There is poverty, crime, kidnappings. (It is not mentioned, but this is when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/rodrigo-duterte\">Rodrigo Duterte</a> was beginning his tough-guy political career in the Philippines.) <br></p> <p>Horacia (Charo Santos-Concio) has served 30 years for a murder she didn\u2019t commit. Then the actual culprit \u2013 who was Horacia\u2019s friend \u2013 commits suicide in prison, leaving behind a confession, revealing that Horacia\u2019s ex-boyfriend Rodrigo Trinidad (Michael de Mesa), now a wealthy gangster, was behind it all, and had her framed. </p> <p>Horacia, institutionalised and having long since lost touch with anyone on the outside, is briskly released. The sole expression of official regret is the female warden\u2019s motherly, sorrowing moans of: \u201cSorry, so sorry\u2026\u201d </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9c92c45ea727aca622911cefd806f012d3a696de\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9c92c45ea727aca622911cefd806f012d3a696de/0_0_620_347/500.jpg\" alt=\"In the dark \u2026 The Woman Who Left\" width=\"500\" height=\"280\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">In the dark \u2026 The Woman Who Left</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR Company Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Horacia comes home to find that her husband is dead, her estranged daughter runs a stall and her son is missing. So she sells her modest property and heads for the big city where Rodrigo is in the habit of attending mass in the cathedral \u2013 and she buys a gun. A hunchbacked vendor of <em>balots</em>, bird embryos sold in their shells as street food, tells her about the rich criminal classes swaggering around among the poor. A lonely woman with mental difficulties befriends her and shows her the cathedral. We appear to be inching, slowly, towards payback.</p> <p>Then a kind of miracle happens: Horacia befriends a transgender prostitute called Hollanda (John Lloyd Cruz) who has been badly beaten up. Looking after this poor soul becomes her new mission \u2013 and she realises that this has allowed her to rediscover a moral meaning to her life.</p> <p>The themes of God and judgment are all around. The <em>balot</em> seller tells Horacia that he believes God has cured his sick child. She has many conversations with him in the fathomless darkness. She tells him: \u201cI really am a creature of the dark.\u201d \u201cA vampire?\u201d he asks. When he is beaten up by a hoodlum wielding a gun, Horacia demonstrates to him how to disarm an assailant. \u201cWhere did you learn to do that?\u201d he asks, astonished. \u201cIn the dark,\u201d she replies \u2013 that is, of course, in prison. But Horacia has been in the dark all her life: a long dark night in the Garden of Gethsemane. <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7c492d5506990fb1cbba0bac852075e47e004dd8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7c492d5506990fb1cbba0bac852075e47e004dd8/0_0_1920_1080/1000.png\" alt=\"Troubled \u2026 Michael De Mesa as Rodrigo in The Woman Who Left.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"563\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Troubled \u2026 Michael De Mesa as Rodrigo.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of TIFF</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As for Rodrigo, he too is troubled by the existence of God and the suspicion that he hasn\u2019t got away with anything.

  "<p>In Alicia\u2019s tiny attic flat (\u201clike a doll\u2019s house,\u201d as she puts it) in Lewisham, south London, she has reached day 20 without running water.</p> <p>Since her landlord started to gut the two empty floors below her last year, the 55-year-old has been living on top of a building site. Scaffolding covers the outside of the three-storey house, a criss-cross of boards and metal poles metres high. The entrance hall ceilings are stripped bare, naked wires hanging down.</p> <p>The flat\u2019s electricity comes and goes: put the heating on and the circuit overloads. Two buckets and a hose sit near the front door on the ground floor, offered to her as a makeshift water supply.</p> <p>To wash, Alicia has to carry water from the bucket downstairs up to the attic, then boil it. It\u2019s too dirty for human consumption, so every other day she has to get drinking water from her nearest friend\u2019s home, two bus rides away: she puts four empty bottles in a suitcase, travels for an hour on the buses, walks to her friend\u2019s house, fills each of the bottles up, and then lugs the suitcase and water back to her flat.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/06/concentric-poverty-debt-child-tax-credits\">Meet Sally, trapped in Concentrix\u2019s circle of poverty, debt and fear</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Alicia has mental health problems \u2013 anxiety with suicidal tendencies, body dysphoria and obsessive compulsive disorder \u2013 and living conditions that would be distressing for anyone, are torture to her. \u201cI hate it,\u201d she says, her voice shaking. \u201cI feel so out of control.\u201d</p> <p>She goes to Lewisham council\u2019s offices to ask for help: she gets there at 9am, 90 minutes before the first appointment to get the first ticket and waits all day. \u201cEvery time I go down there, I end up crying,\u201d she says. \u201cThey don\u2019t listen to me.\u201d</p> <p>As we talk, Alicia is notably hoarse. She\u2019s a survivor of sexual and physical abuse and her voice shows the physical damage. \u201cFrom the strangling,\u201d she explains. Psychologically, the damage runs deeper: on top of an anxiety around being clean, she\u2019s terrified around male strangers, to the extent that her medical records state it\u2019s impossible for her to share a bathroom. But over the past month, the council has tried to push Alicia to two shared accommodations: one already occupied by a couple, and another with mould patches on the walls, a broken toilet and four other tenants, but no locks on the doors. Both properties happen to be owned by her current landlord.</p> <p>In the centre of the capital\u2019s housing crisis, tenants like Alicia are little more than a commodity for profit. Four years ago, she took this flat because she was desperate: her old private rental, a basement below a betting shop in Brixton, had no ventilation and \u201ceverything was rotting\u201d. From the minute she moved in to the attic, the electrics were botched. She had to pay to get two safe plugs connected. She\u2019s never had hot water, even before the building work started. The skylight in the hallway leaks and when it rains she has to line the hall with pots. \u201cIf I don\u2019t get home in time, it\u2019s flooded,\u201d she says. Still, rent gets paid: \u00a3800 a month from Lewisham council in housing benefit.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Alicia has mental health problems, and living conditions that would be distressing for anyone are torture to her</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cAnd the council knew about all the problems,\u201d she says. \u201cBut nothing gets done.\u201d</p> <p>I speak to Caroline, a volunteer community worker, who\u2019s been trying to help Alicia get a response from Lewisham council. She shows me copies of emails she\u2019s sent, one after another. \u201cThe house is literally being pulled down around her,\u201d she says. \u201cBut the council know this and they still aren\u2019t doing anything about it.\u201d</p> <p>After pressure from Caroline and a legal aid solicitor, last week an environmental health officer from the council finally inspected Alicia\u2019s flat. As a result, on Friday, Lewisham sent her to temporary accommodation: a hostel, filled with men, drinking and screaming. Alicia spent the night awake, huddled on the bed, unable to go to the shared toilet. By the morning, she was in the middle of a suicidal episode and had to call Caroline and get a taxi to take her home. \u201cI was petrified,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019d rather have no water than be scared.\u201d</p> <p>A Lewisham council spokesperson confirmed they were asked to visit to \u201cverify the issues\u201d with Alicia\u2019s current landlord and have done so. \u201cAs a result of the findings of this visit, [Alicia] was placed in temporary accommodation which she has since vacated,\u201d they added. \u201c[Alicia\u2019s] health needs in relation to her housing are currently being assessed and will be followed up with her care team. Her case is ongoing.\u201d</p> <p>The council\u2019s environmental health officer gave Alicia\u2019s landlord four working days to reinstate her water supply, Caroline says. That deadline passed on Tuesday. It means, in practice, that a vulnerable woman has been left in a derelict building site without running water.</p> <p>\u201cI just want to be far away from here,\u201d Alicia says. \u201cMy health is getting worse.\u201d</p> <p><em>\u2022 Names have been changed </em></p>",
  "<p>I\u2019ve been reading Peter Riley\u2019s recent pamphlet <a href=\"https://caldervalleypoetry.com/authors/peter-riley-2/\">Pennine Tales</a>, and the first thing to really strike me about it (apart from the quality of the writing) is the ubiquity of buses and bus trips through the poems. These are short, local journeys in and around Riley\u2019s adopted home of Hebden Bridge, the kind of trip that makes life possible for the carless local or for anyone who fancies an evening in a local pub. Reading the poems made me think of the way bus journeys have formed part of the fabric of so many poems in the last century or so.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/06/national-poetry-day-diversity\">On National Poetry Day we should be championing the artform\u2019s diversity | Bridget Minamore</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Buses are a unique mode of transport. Unlike cars, they are shared public spaces, full of strangers. Unlike trains and their exclusive track system, buses interact with other vehicles and road users. As a result, they are the most social way of getting around. They also tend to be cheap, opening up new horizons to travellers \u2013 poets included. Indeed, for <a href=\"https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems-and-poets/poems/detail/54936\">Andrei Codrescu</a>, the Greyhound bus defines the very geography of US poetry, a geography where the idea of a \u201clocal\u201d poet is almost extinct, as writers criss-cross the continent courtesy of General Motors.</p> <p>The American fascination with long-distance bus journeys lies behind <a href=\"https://www.poetryfoundation.org/resources/learning/core-poems/detail/48288\">Elizabeth Bishop\u2019s The Moose</a>. As might be expected, it\u2019s a journey westward, but this is New England, not the Great Plains, and the sights out the window are either of the sea or domestic scenes: gardens, women at work. And these are accompanied by the sound of soothing, local conversation of the kind that triggers memories. This is what bus travel is like, you think. Then the moose appears, a harbinger of another order, the world of wild nature interrupting the mobile domesticity of the coach with a sudden, unexpected, inexplicable \u201csweet sensation of joy\u201d. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b644e84afa49f3b3dde85b8287d1be755b2c3228\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b644e84afa49f3b3dde85b8287d1be755b2c3228/0_407_1508_1214/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Poetry in motion \u2026 a Greyhound bus on the road.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"805\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Poetry in motion \u2026 a Greyhound bus on the road.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allan Grant/Time &amp; Life Pictures/Getty Image</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Philip Levine\u2019s trip <a href=\"https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/browse?volume=174&amp;issue=1&amp;page=25\">By Bus to Fresno</a> is more the material for the great American road poem, but like so many similar journeys it comes down to the small matter of a child asking the perennial question \u201cAre we there yet?\u201d In Levine\u2019s case, the question evokes a world of memory. It is the dual memory of his own childhood and of the child on the bus that illuminates the poem.</p> <p>The journeys in both these poems are interrupted, one by an animal, the other by a petrol stop. <a href=\"http://www.poetrysoup.com/famous/poem/in_the_baggage_room_at_greyhound_3637\">In the Baggage Room at Greyhound by Allen Ginsberg</a> reminds us of the work that goes into a bus trip before it even starts. It\u2019s a glimpse behind the scenes of the well-oiled machine, and what is shown might well rob the odyssey of at least some of its romance. As with so many of life\u2019s pleasures, the foundation on which 1950s Greyhound journeys rested consisted of underpaid and overworked staff in the background. It\u2019s an uncharacteristically direct political statement for a Beat, but when Ginsberg writes \u201cI am a communist\u201d near the end of the poem, it makes perfect sense in light of all that has gone before.</p> <p>In the UK, bus journeys are, perforce, shorter and less epic. Take, for example, Ellen Acton\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/browse?contentId=22291\">Bus Trip in Cornwall</a>, with its canvas-topped bus and shilling cream teas, and the wonderful word \u201cjounced\u201d, an amalgam of \u201cjolted\u201d and \u201cbounced\u201d that captures just the feeling of being in an old coach on bad roads. It\u2019s only when you remember that the poem was written in the run-up to the second world war that you realise that this is more than just an outing \u2013 it\u2019s a celebration of a world that\u2019s about to disappear in the cataclysm that lies ahead. </p> <p>You don\u2019t get much more ordinary than a commuter trip on a London bus, but when Ezra Pound took just such a journey in 1912, the eyes of a young woman fellow-passenger summoned up memories of Paris and of a lost love. Interestingly, <a href=\"http://www.bartleby.com/300/777.html\">the resulting poem is in French</a>, a neat counterbalance to the better-known In a Station of the Metro, in which a Parisian experience is recounted in English. For Pound and his audience, buses and metros were new, modern and exciting, not least for the opportunities they presented for close scrutiny of total strangers. In that, they have not changed much in the intervening century or so.</p> <p>This month\u2019s challenge is to post poems about buses. Whether your experience is of a trans-continental voyage of discovery, a modest trip around some local beauty spots or the daily commute, buses are excellent places to find inspiration. Why not share the results here?</p>",
  "<p>Tammie Hagen has a secret code for finding felons. Touring the streets of Richmond on her bicycle, the 51-year-old former restaurant manager stops Virginians and asks if they are registered to vote.</p> <p>If the answer is \u201cI can\u2019t\u201d, she follows up with the stigma-sensitive phrase: \u201cAre you still on supervision?\u201d</p> <p>It elicits a knowing response from those who, like her, want to take part in democracy but have been barred in their <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/10/06/us/unequal-effect-of-laws-that-block-felons-from-voting.html?hp&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;clickSource=story-heading&amp;module=second-column-region&amp;region=top-news&amp;WT.nav=top-news&amp;_r=0\">millions across the US</a>, due to a brush with the criminal justice system at some point in their lives. </p> <p>As the deadline approaches for registering to take part in one of the most consequential US elections in a generation, Virginia is the exception to controversial state rules that ban those convicted of a felony from voting. </p> <p>The state\u2019s Democratic governor, Terry McAuliffe, had to circumvent Republican-led attempts in the state supreme court to block a blanket amnesty, and he did so by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/apr/22/virginia-restores-voting-rights-felons-governor-terry-mcauliffe\">individually clearing felons to vote</a> \u2013 one signature at a time.

Thirteen thousand former offenders who registered to vote when McAuliffe first attempted an automatic clearance were later told they had been disenfranchised once again, when the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/22/virginia-executive-order-felon-voting-supreme-court\">court ruled his executive action was in breach</a> of the state constitution. </p> <p>Hence the effort through individual signatures, as groups such as <a href=\"http://www.newvirginiamajority.org/\">New Virginia Majority</a>, for which Hagen now works, are scrambling to find suitable candidates for gubernatorial clemency. The effort is as much about overcoming weary cynicism as getting paperwork to the governor\u2019s office in time.</p> <p> \u201cIt felt pretty bleak,\u201d says Hagen as she describes reaction to the first setback. \u201cPeople were really discouraged. I came across lots who were reluctant to try again. \u2018It\u2019s not going to happen,\u2019 they\u2019d say, \u2018my vote\u2019s not going to happen.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>It is a feeling with which she can sympathise, as she says she had \u201cconsigned\u201d herself \u201cto never voting in my life\u201d, thanks to a string of \u201cpetty drug offences\u201d that led to her first felony conviction at 25 and a last one six or seven years ago.</p> <p>But rehabilitation led to a conviction that ex-offenders deserve to play a role in political life.

They would simply prefer more stringent tests before the right is restored.</p> <p> \u201cThe best argument that the other side has to make is that it is important to do what we can to reintegrate felons back into society and it certainly would be a bad thing if society sent a message that once you have committed a felony your civil life is over,\u201d Clegg says.</p> <p> \u201cBut the automatic reinfranchisement of felons misses an opportunity to do that kind of reintegration. There should be a ceremony like a naturalisation ceremony, where you go down to the courthouse and the person brings their friends and family around and everyone has a little American flag. That would be meaningful.\u201d</p> <p> For those on the streets trying to persuade ex-offenders to give democracy a second chance, there is plenty of meaning in the process already.</p> <p> \u201cThese are folks who have been systematically kicked out of the system, who have been ignored,\u201d says Matthew Rogers, regional field director of New Virginia Majority in Alexandria. </p> <p>\u201cMany of them do not even know their rights have been restored. So many of them break down in tears they are so excited.\u201d</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/abs/10.1175/JCLI-D-16-0333.1\">A new study</a> has just appeared in the <a href=\"http://journals.ametsoc.org/toc/clim/current\">Journal of Climate</a> which deals with an issue commonly raised by those who deny that human-caused climate change is a serious risk. As I have written many times, we know humans are causing the Earth\u2019s climate to change. We know this for many reasons. <br></p> <p>First, we know that certain gases trap heat; this fact is indisputable. Second, we know that humans have significantly increased the amount of heat-trapping gases in the atmosphere. Again, this is indisputable. Third, we know the Earth is warming (again indisputable). We know the Earth warms because we are actually measuring the warming rate in multiple different ways. Those measurements are in good agreement with each other.</p> <p>Of course there is other evidence too. For instance, ice loss across the globe is widespread: in the Arctic, the Antarctic ice shelves, Greenland, and from land glaciers. Sea levels are rising as warm water expands in volume and as melt waters flow into the ocean. We are also seeing changes of weather patterns and climatic zones shift. The point is, there is a whole body of evidence that proves the climate is changing and the change is caused largely by human emissions of greenhouse gases. </p> <p>Over the years, contrarians have looked for evidence that the climate either isn\u2019t changing or the change is not as fast as predicted. Their findings have often been used in the media to suggest that human-caused climate change was not something to worry about. But we\u2019ve seen, over and over and over again, that these contrarian arguments don\u2019t hold up. <br></p> <p>Repeatedly, mainstream scientists have taken these claims seriously and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2014/apr/11/climate-change-research-quality-imbalance\">discovered they were just plain wrong</a>. In some cases, the contrarians have made simple arithmetic errors (like mixing up a negative and positive sign in their equations), while in others, they have made more fundamental errors. But regardless, they have been wrong time after time. But whenever they are found to be wrong, they just go and find some new piece of evidence that once again calls into doubt our understanding of the human-climate link. <br></p> <p>One contrarian argument has appeared repeatedly over the past few years, even at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2016/jan/18/ted-cruz-fact-check-which-temperature-data-are-the-best\">a hearing before the U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce</a> held by Ted Cruz in 2015. The claim was by well-known contrarian <a href=\"http://www.skepticalscience.com/John_Christy_blog.htm\">John Christy</a>. Christy claimed that the mid-troposphere temperatures (temperatures in approximately the middle of the atmosphere) are rising three times faster in climate models when compared with measurements. Another related claim is that there has been no statistically significant warming in the troposphere (lower part of the atmosphere) for 18 years. <br></p> <p>Now, both of these facts, even if they were true, would not prove much. We know the Earth is warming because of measurements in oceans, underground, and at the Earth\u2019s surface. But it would open a question as to why the atmosphere is behaving differently.</p> <p>The recent paper just published looked at these two claims. The authors found errors in the analysis that, when corrected, debunked the contrarian claims. Let me explain some of the science. </p> <p>First, these atmospheric temperatures are measured by satellites which can \u201csee\u201d the temperature of gases in the atmosphere. It works differently from a thermometer but regardless, such measurements are possible. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2016/jan/18/ted-cruz-fact-check-which-temperature-data-are-the-best\">These measurements have a lot of uncertainty</a>. <br></p> <p>First of all, as the Earth warms from greenhouse gases, the upper part of the atmosphere should cool down. A simplistic but appropriate description is that greenhouse gases hold the heat down toward the Earth, making the upper atmosphere cooler. Since the satellites see both the upper and lower parts of the atmosphere, the cooling upper region may contaminate the measurements of the warming lower part of the atmosphere.</p> <p>A second source of uncertainty is that the satellites themselves are not perfect. When satellites are launched, they orbit the Earth for a number of years until they are replaced by new satellites. The data, which goes back to 1979, is actually stitched together from multiple satellites in sequence. No two satellites are completely identical \u2013 sort of like no two thermometers will give exactly the same temperature. These differences have to be rectified and are another source of error.</p> <p>Additionally, the satellites change while they are in orbit, in particular they lose altitude and their orbiting time drifts (the time they pass certain global locations drifts later and later in the day). Both of these facts contaminate the measurements and must be accounted for. There are other accuracy issues as well that space doesn\u2019t permit discussion, but you get the point.</p> <p>So, this recent paper did a few things. First, they took the contrarian argument that the mid-troposphere temperatures have been rising at only 1/3 the rate predicted by models. They found that Christy\u2019s team neglected the contamination of the cooling in the upper stratosphere. When they applied this correction, they found that Christy\u2019s claim was incorrect. Differences between modeled and observed warming rates were much smaller, and had known explanations. <br></p> <p>Next, the authors asked whether it is true that there has been no warming in the lower atmosphere (troposphere) in the past 18 years. They found that for five of the six groups that provide satellite temperature analysis, this claim was also incorrect.</p> <p>Finally, they asked whether it is true that the temperature changes in different layers of the atmosphere are in disagreement in models and measurements. Their result is that when temperature changes in different layers of the atmosphere are compared, one of three satellite records is in close agreement with the climate models. <br></p> <p>While this paper largely debunks the most current contrarian mainstay, it doesn\u2019t answer all of our questions. For instance, exactly how accurate are these satellite measurements and how can they be made better? Do the models capture all of the thermal processes which are occurring, especially in the middle and upper layer of the atmosphere? Why does there appear to be a small difference in the satellites and the model predictions in the middle of the atmosphere? Is this difference important? </p> <p>These questions can be answered, but a prerequisite is a continuation of high-quality data from satellites. This means a continued commitment to launching new measurement satellites as the current fleet ages.</p>",
  "<p>Surely this is the season the Cubs\u2019 curse ends. This year, the futility of rooting for lovable losers will become a piece of Chicago nostalgia, alongside Ferris Bueller singing Twist and Shout, Siskel and Ebert bickering over movie reviews, and Soldier Field looking like a 20th century building rather than a 22nd century spaceship. Right?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2016/sep/25/jose-fernandez-death-miami-marlins-baseball\">Jos\u00e9 Fern\u00e1ndez: a smiling star whose death leaves baseball bereft</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Statistically speaking, probably not. </p> <p>Yes, the Cubs had the best record in baseball this year, by a considerable margin. They won 103 games. But since Major League Baseball entered the wild-card era in 1995, having such a record is nearly a kiss of death.</p> <p>Consider the stats (all from 1995 onward):</p> <ul> <li>No National League team has won 100 regular-season games and won the World Series. The only team in baseball to achieve the feat is the New York Yankees, in 1998 and 2009. Only two 100-win National League teams have even reached the Series.<br><br></li> <li>No team other than the aforementioned 1998 and 2009 Yankees has posted the outright best record in baseball and won the World Series. Boston won the Series in 2007 and 2013 after tying for baseball\u2019s best record.<br><br></li> <li>Last year, Kansas City became the seventh team of the wild-card era to post the best record in its league (excluding Boston\u2019s tie in 2007) and win the World Series. In that same span, six wild-card teams have won the Series.<br><br></li> <li>The top National League team in the regular season hasn\u2019t won the World Series since the Atlanta Braves did it in 1995.</li> </ul> <p>In other words, when baseball adopted the wild card two decades ago, the playoffs turned into a lottery. With a best-of-five series and two best-of-seven series, winning the World Series is the statistical equivalent of winning three coin flips. (Four if you\u2019re in the wild-card play-in game.)</p> <p>In fact, it\u2019s worse. By sheer chance, a National League regular-season champion should\u2019ve won the Series in the past 20 years, but it hasn\u2019t happened. </p> <p>And elementary probability will tell you it\u2019s no more likely to happen this year than last year. No matter how many times you\u2019ve tossed a coin, the odds on the next flip are 50-50. As drummer Mick Shrimpton proved when he exploded at the end of This is Spinal Tap, the \u201claw of averages\u201d does not exist. </p> <p>No wonder the wild-card era is such an affront to purists who relish the subtle advantages and percentage plays that work themselves out over 162 games, not just a handful of games in chilly weather.</p> <p>But that\u2019s the convention in American pro sports. The NFL is the only sport that really needs a playoff \u2013 its 32 teams can\u2019t play each other without doubling the length of the bruising season. Yet each league has them.</p> <p>Basketball, at least, plays out according to form most of the time. Since the sixth-seeded Houston Rockets found their chemistry just in time to win the NBA title in 1995, the team with the best regular-season record has made it through the 16-team playoffs unscathed nearly half the time. NBA fans consider it an upset if a third-seeded team, which may actually be the second-best in its conference depending on divisional strength, makes it to the finals and wins.</p> <p>Yet that\u2019s the exception, a by-product of a sport in which a Jordan or a James can make all the difference in any game in November or June. In the NHL, since the Presidents\u2019 Trophy was first awarded to the best regular-season team in 1986, only eight teams have followed up that award with the coolest trophy in sports, the Stanley Cup. </p> <p>Like the NHL, Major League Soccer adds salary restrictions to a low-scoring sport in which one bounce here or there can mean the difference between victory and defeat. In 20 seasons, the Supporters\u2019 Shield (best regular-season record) has as many first-round playoff exits as MLS Cup trophies \u2013 six each. The NWSL (women\u2019s soccer) has a short history, but the Shield winner is 0-for-4 in the playoffs so far.</p> <p>European fans are accustomed to seeing the \u201cleague\u201d and \u201ccup\u201d as two separate trophies, with the league trophy of heavier weight than the cup. American sports, for better or for worse, have evolved differently. Leagues based on the old English system could hardly be fairer \u2013 each team plays the other on its home ground, and the most consistently excellent team wins. The USA trades fairness for excitement, and the genie isn\u2019t going back in the bottle.</p> <p>Cubs fans can say the starting pitchers are nearly unbeatable, with fearsome closer Aroldis Chapman ready to mow down the side in the ninth. Most of the lineup, including the pitchers, can hit at least a little.</p> <p>And maybe that\u2019ll be enough to end the curse. Never mind the non-existence of the \u201claw of averages\u201d \u2013 the NL\u2019s best team has to win it one of these years. Right?</p>",

Dele Alli managed one neat nutmeg but little of any significance. Jesse Lingard, ever the polite guest, endeared himself to the locals by giving Jan Oblak some catching practice with his crosses. It was Theo Walcott who was unable to find his way back to the pitch after one impressively pacy run down a dead-end too many.

Yet for all that it was a night of collective ineptitude, he still managed to stand apart, out on his own, a brilliantly gifted footballer but an individualist who cannot help but undermine himself with his apparent refusal to accept it is a team game. A tragic aroma hangs over him as he looks increasingly lost and alone and sad on the pitch.</p> <p>Ryan Giggs, a pundit on the game for ITV, did not hold back when asked for his assessment. Recalling he played alongside him for Great Britain at London 2012, Giggs praised Sturridge\u2019s touch, speed and awareness, saying he possesses all the necessary attributes to become a top player. Everything, that is, apart from the ability to make the right decision in the final third.</p> <p>Fair though it is to wonder if Sturridge\u2019s history of injury problems has delayed the maturation process, those with his best interests at heart must hope Giggs\u2019s observations hit a nerve with a footballer who can no longer be spoken of in terms of potential. Sturridge is 27, supposedly approaching his peak.</p> <p>Quick, inventive and capable of making it seem as though the ball is glued to his left foot, he is a forward with the enviable skill of surprising goalkeepers by shooting early with no backlift, as Sevilla discovered with that outrageous stabbed finish <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/18/liverpool-sevilla-europa-league-final-player-ratings\" title=\"\">in the Europa League final</a>.</p> <p>Sturridge also scored Liverpool\u2019s decisive goal in the Europa League semi-final win over Villarreal, whose defenders were unable to contain him at Anfield in May. Resist the urge to write him off as another example of an overhyped and underskilled English player. Not only is it a cliche, it ignores reality. Sturridge can play. He has scored a goal against Italy at a World Cup. He provided a rare moment of English quality in France with that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jun/16/england-wales-euro-2016-match-report\" title=\"\">snappy winner against Wales</a>. Alongside Luis Su\u00e1rez, he almost took Liverpool to the title in 2014. Roy Hodgson may have given us Harry Kane, corner-taker extraordinaire, but he was right when he said Sturridge is England\u2019s most naturally talented striker.</p> <p>It is not enough in a serious team and unlikely to be enough for J\u00fcrgen Klopp without concerted improvement, just as Roberto Di Matteo deemed there was no place for Sturridge in the Chelsea side who ground their way to the Champions League in 2012.</p> <p>There is a temptation to depict Sturridge\u2019s tunnel-vision affliction as all that is wrong with English footballers and their struggle to think coherently on the international stage. Something happens to them when they put on that shirt. Eric Dier does not play blind passes for Tottenham Hotspur. Walcott has been one of Arsenal\u2019s best players this season. Jordan Henderson has been assured for Liverpool.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/25/jurgen-klopp-daniel-sturridge-is-not-a-wide-player-for-liverpool\">J\u00fcrgen Klopp: Daniel Sturridge is not a wide player for Liverpool</a> </p> </aside>  <p>These are players rated respectively by Mauricio Pochettino, Ars\u00e8ne Wenger and Klopp, all of which boosts the theory that if Jeremy Paxman had been forced to wear an England shirt during his Newsnight pomp, he would have been reduced to asking politicians about their favourite crisp flavour. Lounging around at Casa St James, Sam Allardyce must have raised a pint of wine to the Daily Telegraph\u2019s entrapment team, grateful the responsibility for eradicating this mental block belongs to Gareth Southgate now.</p> <p>But Sturridge\u2019s slump goes deeper than England\u2019s loss of composure in pressure moments. Too often, this is how it is for club and country, and there are times when we are watching a player who is yet to realise he is crying out for help. The infamous Sturridge scowl, unveiled when Klopp brought on Divock Origi before him against Tottenham in August, suggests he has not understood why this is happening, why his mooching brand of Sturridgeball (one man\u2019s quest to turn a football match into a 90-minute appreciation of Daniel Sturridge\u2019s genius) is so incompatible with Liverpool\u2019s pressing, scurrying, interchangeable front three.</p> <p>There have admittedly been pleasing signs of progress, hints Klopp may be getting through to Sturridge, whose lovely backheeled assist to set up Sadio Man\u00e9 against Leicester City last month was a step in the right direction. Yet his overindulgence against Slovenia heightened the impression of a player craving attention from his manager, like a precocious child trying to impress his bored teacher by reciting the alphabet backwards after being asked to name a vowel. In the same way we are programmed to find that child the most annoying thing in the world, Sturridge needs to stop overcomplicating everything, let it flow naturally and remember no one likes a ball hog.</p>",
  "<h2><strong>1) </strong><strong>Danny Blanchflower</strong> (Middlesborough 7-2<strong> </strong><strong>Chelsea, </strong>16 Dec 1978)</h2> <p>If ever a man seemed destined for management, it was Danny Blanchflower. He was an inspiration on the pitch for Tottenham Hotspur from the moment he replaced Alf Ramsey as captain, running the game from midfield with exceptional intelligence and leading them to the double in 1961. Spurs\u2019 manager, Bill Nicholson, happily admitted that Blanchflower was free to orchestrate play as he saw fit, and Blanchflower\u2019s vision was beautiful \u2013 \u201cthe game is about glory\u201d, after all.<br></p> <p>The Northern Irishman captained Spurs for 265 matches before retiring as a player in 1964 and joining the coaching staff at White Hart Lane. When Nicholson stepped down in 1974 he recommended that Blanchflower take his place but Spurs\u2019 directors decided to look elsewhere just to show who was boss. After <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2010/nov/12/the-joy-of-six-football-pundits\">lending his class to a far shabbier profession</a>, football journalism, Blanchflower did enter management in 1976 with Northern Ireland, where he used his lovely way with words to deliver one of the great pre-match speeches of the age, telling his players\u2019 before a daunting World Cup qualifier away to Johann Cruyff\u2019s Holland that: \u201cA giant is going to knock on our door so we have an alternative: do we slam the door and run away, or kick him in the balls?\u201d The match ended 2-2.</p> <p>The Londoners who eventually asked him to turn his talents to club management were Chelsea rather than Tottenham. In December 1978 the Blues were in a deep financial and sporting rut, \u00a32m in debt and bottom of the First Division. Blanchflower had covered their first match of the season as a journalist and wrote after the 1-0 home defeat by Aston Villa that: \u201cChelsea were terrible. They looked demoralised from the start.\u201d But he agreed to try to raise them when his friend, the Chelsea chairman, Bill Mears, asked him to step into the position vacated by Frank Upson. \u201cWhen he walks through the door he lifts the place,\u201d explained Mears. Alas, that is not quite how things panned out.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jo0GAXZ05xs\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/jo0GAXZ05xs?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Blanchflower\u2019s debut began perfectly, as Peter Osgood opened the scoring at Middlesbrough to ignite hopes that Chelsea were about to end an eight-match winless streak. But, as we keep telling you, that is not quite how things panned out. Micky Burns scored four goals as Middlesbrough came back to win 7-2. Subsequent results included a 5-1 home defeat by Ipswich, a 6-0 loss to Nottingham Forest and a 5-2 embarrassment at Arsenal. Chelsea were relegated, finishing 11 points adrift at the foot of the table and forced to sell their prized asset, Ray Wilkins, to Manchester United. It had turned out that Blanchflower\u2019s aesthetic and moral ideals were incompatible with a relegation scrap. And so after 31 matches, featuring just five victories, Blanchflower, as ever, did the honourable thing, resigning and explaining that the club needed \u201ca younger man with a different set of values.\u201d.</p> <p>Blanchflower, you see, figured that in order to win promotion Chelsea would have to change the way they played and also spend heavily to revamp the squad, and that would entail binning his principles. \u201cThere is no way I could spend \u00a31m on a player without having a conscience about it,\u201d he said, back when no one had heard of Roman Abramovich.</p> <h2>2) Harry Redknapp (<strong>Southampton</strong> 2-2 Middlesborough, 11 Dec 2004)</h2> <p>Talk of refusing to bin principles leads naturally to Harry Redknapp. What? Of course he has principles. But strange things happen. On 24 November 2004, when he surprisingly quit as manager of Portsmouth after seemingly falling out with the owner, Milan Mandaric, Redknapp made it absolutely clear that he had had no intention whatsoever of defecting to arch-rivals Southampton. \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2004/dec/09/newsstory.southampton\">I will not go down the road \u2013 no chance</a>!\u201d he vowed. Two weeks later he went down the road and became manager of Southampton.</p> <p>These days Saints have a reputation for shrewd managerial appointments thanks to the successful reigns of Ronald Koeman, Mauricio Pochettino and Nigel Adkins. But things were different 12 years ago, and Redknapp completed a hat-trick of haplessness even though he was supposed to bring the nous lacked by his two inexperienced predecessors, Paul Sturrock and Steve Wigley. Southampton fans welcomed Redknapp warmly, their glee all the deeper because Pompey fans were distraught at losing a manager who had become a folk hero at Fratton Park by guiding the club back to the top-flight. </p> <p>On his debut at Southampton the home fans took great relish in boasting that they would be the ones to gain from Portsmouth\u2019s loss. Indeed, throughout the game against Boro they belted out chants celebrating the imminent capture of another Portsmouth legend, Jim Smith, as Redknapp\u2019s No2. \u201cHarry and Jim, red and white!\u201d they sang. They never saw the punchline coming.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0eda1ea4dc1e4542f7b518fb4ffc31bcba9695d7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0eda1ea4dc1e4542f7b518fb4ffc31bcba9695d7/0_101_1570_941/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Harry Redknapp flanked by Jim Smith and Kevin Bond during his time at Southampton.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Harry Redknapp flanked by Jim Smith and Kevin Bond during his time at Southampton.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris Ison/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It looked like Redknapp would start justifying Southampton fans\u2019 joy immediately, as Kevin Phillips and Peter Crouch shot them into a 2-0 lead. But the visitors pulled a goal back when a corner was deflected into the net by Danny Higginbotham and Stewart Downing then equalised. So the match ended 2-2, precisely the same result as Wigley\u2019s last home match. Wigley, a rookie manager, won one league game in his 17-match reign. The fact that that victory had been over Redknapp\u2019s Portsmouth should perhaps have warned Southampton that Redknapp might not be the man to turn things around. So it proved, as Southampton were relegated in last place.</p> <p>Just under a year after his sensational arrival at Southampton, Redknapp left \u2013 to return to Portsmouth. \u201cI spoke to Harry who told me he had been considering his future and that he believed Portsmouth to be his \u2018spiritual home\u2019,\u201d said the Southampton chairman, Rupert Lowe, whose consorting with Sir Clive Woodward was among many things that made Redknapp a misfit at St Mary\u2019s. \u201cGobsmacked is too small a word,\u201d gasped the Southampton director Andrew Cowan. \u201cYou don\u2019t even get a plot like this in Star Wars.\u201d</p> <h2>3) <strong>Malcolm Allison</strong> (<strong tabindex=\"-1\">Manchester City</strong> 1-0 Aston Villa, 5 Aug 1972)</h2> <p>The match was an inglorious affair from the start and, as such, a suitable way to mark the break-up of a once happy couple. Firstly, the league champions, Derby County, and the FA Cup holders, Leeds United, declined to take part in the Charity Shield so organisers had to scramble around looking for alternatives. The traditional showpiece wound up having an untraditional lineup, pitting the winners of Division Three, Aston Villa, against Manchester City, who had finished fourth in Division One. But the fact that Villa were from a lower league was not the main reason why City\u2019s manager, Malcolm Allison, was under pressure to win: he needed success because he had just been given sole charge of a club at which he had enjoyed glittering times under Joe Mercer before the relationship turned to dust.</p> <p>Mercer and Allison were diametrically opposed as characters \u2013 the former was never a man for cigars, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2009/may/17/football-seven-deadly-sins-allison-crystal-palace\">fedora hats</a> or dressing room frolics with glamour models \u2013 but for a few golden years they were great together at City. After being appointed in 1965 Mercer wanted an energetic and innovative coach as No2 so hooked up with Allison, whom he had met at Lilleshall. City won the league in 1968, the FA Cup in \u201869 and the League Cup and European Cup Winners\u2019 Cup in \u201870. Magic moments.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8ad5ce911d68fd72a9258ee0bb0f1067eea5d0b9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8ad5ce911d68fd72a9258ee0bb0f1067eea5d0b9/0_0_2820_1692/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Malcolm Allison shows off the League Cup in front of Manchester City fans after they defeated West Bromwich Albion in 1970.

He was No2 to Joe Mercer at the time.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PA/PA Archive/Press Association Ima</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But Maine Road became a den of intrigue. The relationship began to veer off course, not helped by directors sticking their oars in. Allison came close to being jilted several times over the next 18 months but eventually it was Mercer who left, choosing in the summer of 1972 to leave for Coventry City rather than be manoeuvred into irrelevance at the club where he once led. \u201cI did not want to stay at City with the tag of Good Old Joe and be shoved into the background,\u201d he explained. Allison moved up a place and his first match was the improvised take on the traditional curtain-raiser for the following season. City won 1-0 thanks to a penalty by Franny Lee. But the bleakness of their performance was ominous.</p> <p>\u201cIt was not so much a light aperitif for the new season but a heavy warning of diminishing entertainment should negative methods increase,\u201d wrote Cyril Chapman in his match report for the Guardian, adding: \u201cIt would not have been easy to persuade a stranger to football that the main object of the game was to put the ball in the net.\u201d </p> <p>City remained unconvincing when the season kicked off properly, losing five of their first six matches. Despondency took hold. Allison had talked City into spending a club record fee on Rodney Marsh the previous March but months after his arrival the ingenious forward was still looking out of place. He was not alone. The whole team looked out of sorts. Eric Todd, writing in the Guardian later that season, complained that the stroppy spirit that had enveloped City was disfiguring their performances - \u201cbad temper, petulance, time wasting, argument, resentment \u2013 you name it.\u201d By the time Mercer returned to Maine Road with Coventry in March, Allison seemed on the edge, having been thrashed 5-1 by Wolves after being dumped out of the FA Cup by Sunderland, who had zero chance of going on to win the competition, apparently. Mercer\u2019s Coventry won 2-1 at Maine Road. Allison\u2019s prospects darkened still further and his mood was not helped by the club selling Ian Mellor to Norwich against his wishes while he was ill. After a 1-0 home defeat by Chelsea he quit. As it happened he went straight to Crystal Palace and used his debut there to take immediate revenge, beating Chelsea 2-0.</p> <h2>4) <strong>Jos\u00e9 Mourinho</strong> (<strong>Chelsea</strong> 1-0 Manchester United, 15 Aug 2004)</h2> <p>Once upon a time the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2004/feb/26/championsleague.porto\">sight of a Manchester United team in disarray</a> made life easy for Jos\u00e9 Mourinho. When a magnetic young scamp walked out at Stamford Bridge for his first match since arriving in England with a Champions League title and a self-made nickname, he took on a dishevelled United. Sir Alex Ferguson\u2019s team had finished below Claudio Ranieri\u2019s Chelsea and Arsenal\u2019s Invincibles the previous season and for the opening match of the latest campaign they were ravaged by injuries. </p> <p>Ruud van Nistelrooy was a glaring absentee from the trip to Chelsea but United were also short of bodies in central defence, with Rio Ferdinand suspended, and Ferguson unwisely elected to deploy Roy Keane alongside Gary Neville while John O\u2019Shea played in midfield, as did Eric Djemba-Djemba and the debutant Liam Miller. Chelsea had more extravagant debutants, including Petr Cech and Didier Drogba, and won thanks to a scruffy finish by Eidur Gudjohnsson following a flimsy challenge by Tim Howard. \u201cWhen [Mika\u00ebl] Silvestre said we haven\u2019t got the time to create a big team spirit he was wrong,\u201d jabbed Mourinho after the match.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lhKNu5-raU\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6lhKNu5-raU?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Jos\u00e9 Mourinho\u2019s first game in charge of Chelsea ended in a win but he had plenty of praise for Manchester United.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>The Portuguese would go on to win the title in his first season and become an icon at Stamford Bridge, so don\u2019t expect anyone at Chelsea to agree that his comments after his very first match showed he was already angling for the Manchester United gig: \u201cI have to say it\u2019s maybe a bit unfortunate for Manchester United to leave Stamford Bridge without a point. They played well, weren\u2019t afraid of us, and risked everything at 1-0 down. Mr Ferguson pushed me to make changes that normally I don\u2019t do to play a safer match - and in fact the team defended very, very, very well.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>5) Kevin Keegan (Newcastle United </strong>3-0 Bristol City, 8 Feb 1992)</h2> <p>No one saw this coming. When Keegan completed his playing career with fitting panache, leaving the pitch in a helicopter while still in his full Newcastle kit following a post-season friendly against Liverpool, it seemed that a dugout was one place he would not end up. He spent the next seven years living the good life in Marbella, once taking a break from playing golf to declare that occasional punditry would be his only other venture into sport: \u201cIf anyone ever hears that I\u2019m coming back to football full-time, they can laugh as much as I will. It\u2019ll never happen. That\u2019s for certain.\u201d But when Newcastle came calling in February 1992, Keegan could not resist. Newcastle were second bottom in the Second Division but the club\u2019s multi-millionaire owner, Sir John Hall, promised Keegan funds to help guide the club back to the promised land. All Keegan had to do was play the role of messiah. He had a ready-made flock: over 32,000 fans turned up at St James\u2019 Park for his debut in charge, double the attendance at the previous home match, a 4-3 defeat by Charlton. Having been in happy retirement just three days previously Keegan admitted he knew nothing about his first opponents, Bristol City, \u201cother than that they play in red\u201d. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-uzL6LWn3g\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/t-uzL6LWn3g?wmode=opaque\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>\u2018If anyone ever hears that I\u2019m coming back to football full-time, they can laugh as much as I will. It\u2019ll never happen. That\u2019s for certain,\u2019 Kevin Keegan said before returning to manage Newcastle.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>His knowledge of his own side may also have been imperfect: when he read out his team selection at the pre-game press conference he named only 10 players. That fact that the player whom he forgot, Alan Neilson, was a defender was perhaps an indication of the attacking derring-do that Keegan would prioritise. In a stadium crackling with excitement Newcastle beat Bristol City 3-0, David Kelly scoring twice and Liam O\u2019Brien once. This was the start of much more than a successful fight against relegation: it was a renaissance. Briefly the revival looked like being thwarted, as Keegan threatened to quit over unfulfilled promises. But he and Hall worked things out, money came forth and Newcastle surged up the league, starting Keegan\u2019s first full season with 11 straight wins and ending as runaway winners. They graduated to the Premier League and immediately began challenging for the top-flight title. Two second-placed finishes were ultimately as close as they got but that was closer than they\u2019d been for half a century. How Newcastle fans would <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2011/jun/25/kevin-keegan-footballer-manager-liverpool\">love it, really love it</a>, if their team could again go so close and play with such joy again. </p> <h2><strong>6) Brendan Rodgers (</strong>Lincoln Red Imps 1-0 <strong>Celtic</strong>, 12 Jul 2016)</h2> <p>So far Brendan Rodgers has made a good stab at earning forgiveness for this result. But it can never be forgotten. The best he can hope for is that it is eventually reinterpreted as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jul/12/celtic-shock-of-gibraltar-lincoln-red-imps\">a misleadingly catastrophic start</a> to a triumphant reign. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b96af25891277571bda485cd1daf1fbc458363de\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b96af25891277571bda485cd1daf1fbc458363de/0_111_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The scene of Brendan Rodgers\u2019 catastrophic Celtic opener.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The scene of Brendan Rodgers\u2019 catastrophic Celtic opener.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Marcos Moreno/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>",

I gained a place at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama, my contemporaries including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/danielcraig\" title=\"\">Daniel Craig</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/damian-lewis\" title=\"\">Damian Lewis</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/ewanmcgregor\" title=\"\">Ewan McGregor</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/dominic-west\" title=\"\">Dominic West</a>. I believed I was giving myself the best headstart I could and looked forward to going for a wide variety of roles. However, as an \u201cAsian\u201d actor, I was only seen for certain parts: beating people up; getting beaten up; dealing drugs; owning a cornershop; being a doctor. At auditions, I often heard, \u201cThat\u2019s good, but can you do it with an accent?\u201d I wasn\u2019t born in Asia and neither were my parents. I actually come from Trinidad and Tobago, in the Caribbean. But try finding \u201cIndo or Asian-Caribbean\u201d on any form asking for my ethnicity. But I\u2019m English and proud.</p> <p>I had been out of drama school four years when I realised that, rather than bellyaching about it, if I wanted to see change, I should endeavour to be the change. I made <a href=\"http://film.britishcouncil.org/offending-angels\" title=\"\">Offending Angels</a>, with a cast of <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0662744/\" title=\"\">Shaun Parkes</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/mar/15/andrew-lincoln-im-employed-to-go-on-a-zombie-frenzy-killing-spree\" title=\"\">Andrew Lincoln</a>, <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0363117/\" title=\"\">Susannah Harker</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2013/oct/04/jack-davenport-my-family-values-breathless\" title=\"\">Jack Davenport</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/stephen-mangan\" title=\"\">Steve Mangan</a>, among others. But the point of that romcom was to give two leads to non-white actors, where their roles were not governed by their colour. For many reasons beyond my control, the film never got distributed. After years of only being put forward for stereotyped roles, I got out of the industry. It wasn\u2019t enough for me to be paid as an actor, but lose my soul in the doing. After that, I managed to land a highly sought-after place at the National Film and Television School as a screenwriter, intent on trying to make the changes at script level. I wrote a play exploring these issues called That Paki Play. In it, I offer up a game where they have to name 20 famous black actors, and then name 20 Asian ones, without using Bollywood stars.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I disappoint countless would-be employers at auditions with my failure to comply with an Indian accent</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It turns out that trying to get a minority film funded is harder than landing an acting role.

  "<p>Lashing out at his accusers this afternoon, Donald Trump attacked all the women who say he has groped, kissed or inspected them naked without their consent.

The overwhelming majority of sex crimes are committed by men, and neither Trump nor most of the commentators trying to keep up with the current firestorm seem to understand that that fact alone has transformed this race. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>What Trump is now up against is not only his own actions, but the lived experience of every American woman.</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>What Trump is now up against is not only his own actions, but the lived experience of every American woman.</p> <h2>Is there a gender empathy gap?</h2> <p>The last couple of decades brought a sea change in women\u2019s sense of empowerment, as well as a new awareness of issues ranging from harassment to sexual consent. And as Bill Cosby and Roger Ailes could attest, women are no longer willing to remain silent about what men have done with impunity in the past.</p> <p>This week, a man finally acknowledged on national television what many women already understood about the 2016 election. \u201cThis is a gender war,\u201d Donny Deutsch announced on MSNBC\u2019s Morning Joe the morning after the second debate. \u201c<a href=\"https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/lifeandstyle/women\">Women</a> in America are going to stand up and revolt \u2013 every woman in American who has ever been held down, oppressed, harassed. And if you\u2019re not seeing that, you\u2019re missing it.\u201d</p> <p>And yet many men are still missing it.</p> <p>Following the second debate, a series of national polls revealed a gender split that showed women opposing Trump by increasing margins. If only women voted on election day, Hillary Clinton would win in a landslide with 458 electoral votes to only 80 for Trump, as Nate Silver reported on <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/election-update-women-are-defeating-donald-trump/\">FiveThirtyEight.com</a>.</p> <p>As recent days have finally made clear, the 2016 election constitutes a referendum on male entitlement \u2013 and a Clinton victory will herald an earthquake that remakes the social landscape as dramatically as it does the national agenda.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"2d1223555c4b4dd73de0a9d865b1d6e18db8e897\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2d1223555c4b4dd73de0a9d865b1d6e18db8e897/0_0_575_633/454.png\" alt=\"silver-electionupdate-womenvoted\" width=\"454\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>On one issue after another, polls reveal the widening divisions between men and women. Announcing the results of a survey measuring public reactions to Trump\u2019s infamous \u201cgrab her by the pussy\u201d remarks, ABC\u2019s Rachel Tillman <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/43-percent-americans-trump-withdraw-presidential-race/story?id=42671346\">wrote</a>, \u201cThere was a stark gender gap, with 62% of women less likely to vote for him while 55% of men say it will make no difference on their vote.\u201d</p> <p>Such differences should surprise no one, because men lead entirely different lives than women. Over the course of their lifetime, 57% of women report having been touched or grabbed in a sexual way by a stranger in public. Thirty-seven percent of women have had a stranger masturbate in front of them at least once in public.</p> <p>But strangers pose less of a danger than loved ones; more than a third of female murder victims are killed by their intimate partners. One in five women will be <a href=\"http://ncadv.org/learn-more/statistics\">sexually assaulted</a> in their lifetime \u2013 most often by someone they are close to. Trump\u2019s first wife accused him of such acts; in a sworn deposition during their divorce, Ivana Trump <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/donald-trump-ex-wife-claim-he-raped-her-resurfaces-in-new-documentary-a6836151.html\">used</a> the word \u201crape\u201d to describe forced sex in which her husband pulled out fistfuls of her hair.</p> <p>Is it any wonder that the segment of the electorate that is routinely victimized views such offenses differently than the segment of the electorate that commits them?</p> <p>Whether the crime is harassment, domestic violence or murder, the root cause includes an overwhelming sense of male entitlement: \u201cI get to do this to you because I\u2019m the man and you\u2019re a woman.\u201d Such privilege carries an assumption of ownership, as with property rights: experts on domestic violence attest that men are more likely to assault female partners when they feel they\u2019re losing control, as when threatened with a divorce or a restraining order.</p> <p>And men who fear they\u2019re losing control have fueled the rise of Donald Trump. The gender gap between Trump\u2019s support and Clinton\u2019s is particularly staggering among men who are ill-equipped in comparison with their female peers. An ABC News/Washington Post poll at the end of September showed Trump with an overwhelming 59-point lead among among white men who don\u2019t have college degrees \u2013 76% of whom supported him. In an era when women make up nearly 60% of college and graduate school students, those men are falling further and further behind.</p> <p>Despite such numbers, any real recognition of their import has been a long time coming. For the last year and a half, as myriad so-called experts struggled to understand the Trump phenomenon, their analyses focused on race, religion, ethnicity, class and income. With notable obtuseness, they resisted the most universal explanation well past the time when it should have been obvious.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Throughout this campaign, Trump\u2019s public persona has constituted a textbook illustration of male domination</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Throughout this campaign, Trump\u2019s public persona has constituted a textbook illustration of male domination: gaslighting, threatening and insulting at every turn. he has consistently acted like a vicious bully who will stop at nothing to subordinate his foes. At his first debate with Hillary Clinton, he interrupted her 51 times.</p> <p>But Trump\u2019s interrupting and shouting over his adversaries during the debates were only an extension of the domineering traits that have long been clear. This week\u2019s news included reports from Miss USA contestants, some as young as 15, that Trump deliberately walked in on them backstage while they were naked. Trump has even bragged about doing so: \u201cI sort of get away with things like that,\u201d he said on The Howard Stern Show in 2005.</p> <p>As the possessor of a penis, celebrity and a fortune, Trump has never questioned his right to inspect and rank women in terms of his own interest in having sex with them. For decades his objectification of women has remained as consistent as the ugliness of his values; as a self-appointed judge of female worth, he and his beauty pageants and reality shows have perpetuated the misogynistic standards that nullify the value of any woman who is not very young, very thin and conventionally attractive.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/12/miss-arizona-donald-trump-naked-girls-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/577az\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2800383\"            data-video-name=\"Trump 'walked in on naked girls', says former Miss Arizona \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"Reuters/CBS\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57fe79e5e4b03b22b4fb2ae7\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/10/12/161012missusa_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/10/12/161012missusa.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/10/12/161012missusa_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/12/miss-arizona-donald-trump-naked-girls-video\">Trump \u2018walked in on naked girls\u2019, says former Miss Arizona</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>And with Trump, the double standards are so extreme it would be laughable if they weren\u2019t so destructive, from his fat-shaming of former Miss Universe Alicia Machado to the gratuitous insult he lobbed at Heidi Klum when he announced, apropos of nothing, that the supermodel was \u201c<a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2015/08/18/politics/donald-trump-heidi-klum-no-longer-a-ten/\">sadly, no longer a 10</a>\u201d.</p> <p>Nor did Trump \u2013 a chronic philanderer currently married to his third wife, having dumped the previous two after each had borne him children \u2013 see anything wrong with attacking Hillary Clinton over her husband\u2019s past infidelity. No matter what awful things men do, it\u2019s always the woman\u2019s fault.</p> <p>But women are becoming ever less compliant \u2013 and female insurrection is particularly upsetting to men who are already anxious about their ability to maintain their authority.</p> <p>Women have always been penalized for violating conventional gender norms, but no woman has ever had a realistic chance of winning the White House until now \u2013 and the backlash against Clinton\u2019s temerity was apparent from the start of her campaign. </p> <p>As Sandy Garossino wrote in the National Observer, \u201cUntil she ran for president, Clinton was the most admired woman in the world \u2026 So what the hell happened? The woman ran for president, that\u2019s what. Who does she think she is?\u201d</p> <p>Clinton\u2019s approval ratings have fluctuated wildly for decades. But the 2016 campaign ratcheted up the stakes to the point where the Republican nominee has promised to jail the female opponent who trounced him in both debates.</p> <h2>The confidence of the mediocre white man</h2> <p>Invoking the popularity of a tote bag that reads, \u201cLord, Give Me the Confidence of a Mediocre White Man,\u201d Jessica Valenti wrote about how exasperating it is to deal with \u201ca bombastic but woefully under-informed man who is convinced of how much smarter he is than you\u201d. When the article was published in the Guardian, its headline was: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/28/mediocre-male-donald-trump-clinton-debate\">Why the mediocre male\u2019s days may be numbered</a>.</p> <p>Such predictions are, of course, what those men are worried about.

But the archetype is painfully familiar, as Nicholas Kristof pointed out in a New York Times op-ed column headlined: <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/29/opinion/that-seventh-grade-bully-is-running-for-president.html\">A 7th grade bully runs for president</a>. Kristof\u2019s litany of characteristic behaviors was withering: \u201cThe boasts about not doing homework, the habit of blaming others when things go wrong, the penchant for exaggerating everything into the best ever, the braggadocio to mask insecurity about size of hands or genitals, the biting put-downs of others, the laziness, the self-absorption, the narcissism, the lack of empathy \u2013 and the immaturity that reduces a woman to her breasts.\u201d</p> <p>As Kristof\u2019s list suggests, the less hard-working or accomplished men are, the more threatened they seem by the prospect of having to compete on a level playing field \u2013 and the more they resist the prospect of real female empowerment.</p> <p>Despite growing competition, many men \u2013 like Trump in the run-up to the first debate \u2013 refuse to compensate by working harder, no matter how poorly they fare. Time-use studies show that <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/blogs/xx_factor/2015/01/06/gender_and_housework_even_men_who_don_t_work_do_less_than_women.html\">even when men don\u2019t have jobs</a>, they do far less housework and childcare than their working wives.</p> <p>Whether the issue is slacker husbands or discriminatory bosses who perpetuate the inequities of the gender pay gap, some women remain acquiescent to the unfairness of the status quo \u2013 but a lot of others are simply fed up. The question is: how many \u2013 and are they exasperated enough to head for the polls in droves? And will enough fair-minded men join them to elect the first female president in American history?</p> <p>The answer depends on how far we\u2019ve come in accepting the idea of women as truly equal human beings who sometimes outdo their male counterparts. Last month Vanity Fair reposted <a href=\"http://www.vanityfair.com/news/1994/06/hillary-rodham-clinton-first-lady\">a profile I wrote in 1994</a>, when the then first lady was working on healthcare reform. The article quoted a powerful Capitol Hill insider who compared Mrs Clinton\u2019s performance with that of her husband, the president. \u201cI\u2019ve seen them both make presentations, with dozens of senators at the table, and she\u2019s better than he is,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd these guys know it. They\u2019ve sat in rooms with her, and they\u2019ve sat in rooms with him. He\u2019s good \u2013 he\u2019s very good. She\u2019s just fucking perfect.\u201d</p> <p>In a globalized world increasingly riven by conflicts of byzantine complexity, Clinton\u2019s hard-earned knowledge and experience constitute her strongest claim to the Oval Office. But her rival \u2013 and the male minions who laud him as a \u201cgenius\u201d for evading taxes \u2013 fail to appreciate even that obvious point.</p> <h2>Is this the president we want for our sons?</h2> <p>As election day approaches, the larger question is how much sense of self-preservation will be manifested by the nation\u2019s adult females.</p> <p>Will American women \u2013 and the men who actually care about their welfare \u2013 support the leadership of a man who feels entitled to kiss strangers on the mouth and brag about grabbing crotches, simply because he is rich and famous and male?</p> <p>Will voters agree that a man should view and rank all women according to their physical attributes and fire those he doesn\u2019t find sexually desirable, because he thinks a woman\u2019s value is measured by her looks?</p> <p>Will voters approve the double standards of a man who publicly humiliates women for their sexual conduct even as he laughs off his own far more lurid transgressions?</p> <p>Will the electorate agree that males don\u2019t have to play by the rules \u2013 that men don\u2019t need to do what\u2019s best for their families (like refraining from dumping the mothers of their children in tabloid sex scandals) or for the economy (like paying contractors who provided services instead of cheating them) or for their country (like paying taxes)?</p> <p>The Clinton campaign has been running a commercial featuring some of Trump\u2019s denigrating comments about women, superimposed over pictures of uncertain young girls scrutinizing themselves in the mirror as they struggle to decide whether their bodies define their value in the world. \u201cIs this the president we want for our daughters?\u201d the ad asks.</p> <p>That leaves out an equally critical question: is this the president we want for our sons?</p> <p>A vote for Trump is a vote for the continuation of male entitlement \u2013 for the arrogance and inequity of unearned privilege, for the acceptance of irresponsibility in personal, familial and civic behaviors, and for the perpetuation of all the hateful biases that oppress women solely because of their gender.</p> <p>Is this the world we want to keep on living in, or is it finally time for us to demand a better one?</p> <p></p>",
  "<p>First Direct has launched a new era of jumbo-sized personal loans, allowing customers to borrow as much as \u00a350,000 without the need to secure it against property or jump through the hoops of a mortgage application process.</p> <p>Previously, the bank\u2019s maximum personal loan was \u00a330,000, and the new ceiling leapfrogs the maximum at other lenders such as Sainsbury\u2019s (\u00a340,000) and Tesco (\u00a335,000).

So nearly half of applicants may end up with a much higher interest rate, or be rejected for a loan.</p> <p>According to data provider Moneyfacts.co.uk, the best personal loan rate on offer to someone with a fair credit rating is 14.9%, while someone with a poor rating is unlikely to be offered a deal below 37.9%, compared with the 0.25% Bank of England base rate.</p> <p>Nearly all the providers offer loan calculators to enable potential borrowers to estimate monthly costs, but in reality the only way borrowers will discover if they will obtain the lowest rate is by applying. Generally speaking, if you have any adverse marks on your credit file, then the chances of obtaining the low advertised rates are virtually zero.</p> <p>Martin Lewis of Moneysavingexpert.com says that individuals should consider credit cards for borrowings below \u00a35,000. \u201cYou can get up to 28 months 0% spending on a credit card, but this is only useful if you can budget to pay your debt off in that time, or you\u2019re organised enough to balance transfer the debt to another card before the 0% period ends.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>Sony\u2019s PlayStation VR headset launches this week, offering a more affordable and intuitive introduction to the concept than the likes of the HTC Vive and Oculus Rift. All you need is a PlayStation 4, a PlayStation Camera \u2013 and the \u00a3350 headset itself of course.</p> <p>If you\u2019ve taken the plunge into virtual gaming, here are the nine games we\u2019d recommend trying first.</p> <h2>Rez Infinite (Enhance Games, \u00a325)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b791627c9e2fd61a030d9f696c0b6ee8fc59fdd9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b791627c9e2fd61a030d9f696c0b6ee8fc59fdd9/18_0_600_360/500.jpg\" alt=\"Rez Infinite\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rave flyers and ancient architecture \u2026 Rez Infinite.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Enhance</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The reboot of Tetsuya Mizuguchi\u2019s cult rhythm shooter Rez may deliver familiar content, but its a tremendous fit for VR. The on-rails, sonic journey through a world built from rave flyers and ancient architecture is a wonder to explore via a headset, and delightfully reminiscent of the VR vision the 1990s promised, and promptly failed to deliver. </p> <h2>Tumble VR (Supermassive Games, \u00a38)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"660581177a3b25389fe426454612b94e6ceb8630\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/660581177a3b25389fe426454612b94e6ceb8630/319_0_7196_4320/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tumble VR\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Understated gem \u2026 Tumble VR.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Supermassive Games</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>If Sony\u2019s headset brings an understated gem to the table, it is surely Tumble VR. This simple puzzle game sees players piling up blocks to meet various goals, whether reaching for height, deflecting lasers or building round obstacles. The pleasure is in the highly tactile nature of selecting and placing blocks, making it feel very much like a simulated form of Jenga. Atypically meditative in contrast to its launch lineup stable mates, Tumble VR is as rewarding as it is modest. </p> <h2>EVE Valkyrie (CCP, \u00a355)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4a5aa4fb8ec0e5d67c9b0d5feb9df3934de8b27c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4a5aa4fb8ec0e5d67c9b0d5feb9df3934de8b27c/60_0_1799_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"EVE Valkyrie\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dogfighting in space \u2026 EVE Valkyrie.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: CCP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Since the prototype Oculus Rift rekindled affection for VR, the traditional 3D space shooter has enjoyed a return to prominence. The reason? Glancing around and out your cockpit as you dogfight in the stars is a beguiling notion, and as there\u2019s no character movement, it\u2019s much easier on those who have limited space or are prone to motion sickness. In practice, everything works rather well, and while Valkyrie isn\u2019t perfect, it hammers home a VR fantasy many have waited a considerable time to experience: shooting aliens from inside a cool spacecraft. </p> <h2>Batman: Arkham VR (Warner Bros, \u00a316)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9a9081eca3fa15deafde3b2c4561b3871d4f0aa3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9a9081eca3fa15deafde3b2c4561b3871d4f0aa3/0_0_588_353/500.jpg\" alt=\"Batman Arkham VR\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dark Knight as detective \u2026 Batman Arkham VR.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Warner Bros</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Devoted to the Dark Knight\u2019s role as detective, Batman: Arkham VR highlights the fact that virtual reality can be at its strongest when shunning action. Here the emphasis is on a series of scenes where the Caped Crusader gathers clues and solves crimes. Rocksteady\u2019s game may be too fleeting for some, but it offers an astounding sense of presence \u2013 that feeling you really are inhabiting its world. And seeing yourself reflected in a mirror wearing the bat suit is an extraordinary moment.</p> <h2>Super Hypercube (Kokoromi, \u00a325)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9720cfdb60e51d791a0d78de5e8cff169bcf13ae\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9720cfdb60e51d791a0d78de5e8cff169bcf13ae/0_0_1799_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tetris on acid \u2026 Super Hypercube\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Super Hypercube.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kokoromi</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Best described as a cross between Tetris and Super Hexagon, Kokoromi\u2019s trippy, first-person puzzler has players reorganising clusters of blocks in order to navigate a series of approaching walls \u2013 each with a specifically shaped gap to slip through. The virtual reality element is subtly used, allowing clusters to be viewed from all angles, and the minimalist, hyper-colourful design makes for a highly sensual environment. This is a beautifully constructed score chaser.</p> <h2>Thumper (Drool, \u00a316)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"97ab2436c8f3a03b33883ac9d88f7a122c619c77\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/97ab2436c8f3a03b33883ac9d88f7a122c619c77/27_0_938_563/500.jpg\" alt=\"Thumper\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cosmic obstacle course \u2026 Thumper.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Drool</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Billed as a rhythm violence game, Thumper is a sort of cosmic obstacle course swirling through a bullet hell shooter. The simple controls have you piloting a metallic beetle along a galactic track, hitting buttons to take corners, leap over barriers and fire missiles, all to a driving electronic beat. Designed by ex-members of the Harmonix team (makers of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/mar/06/rock-band-guitar-hero-music-games-returning\">Guitar Hero and Rock Band</a>), it\u2019s a visually astonishing test of timing and coordination.</p> <h2>Job Simulator (Owlchemy Labs, \u00a324)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7b50b28e8acf72ec30ba7f905689a5f9b840203c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7b50b28e8acf72ec30ba7f905689a5f9b840203c/0_0_1499_900/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Job Simulator\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Boisterous anti-realism \u2026 Job Simulator.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Owlchemy Labs</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Transporting players to a cartoonish realm, Job simulator demonstrates VR\u2019s capacity to host a new form of comedy. This is a game that \u2013 through anarchic simulations of careers from chef to office worker \u2013 offers a boisterous anti-realism. It perhaps makes a strength of unruly interaction, but is delightfully silly, and perfect for introducing friends to VR. </p> <h2>PlayStation VR Worlds (Sony, \u00a325)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7183d7fd60789a9fbf828ef288c319d074ef4e14\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7183d7fd60789a9fbf828ef288c319d074ef4e14/480_183_3294_1977/1000.jpg\" alt=\"London Heist\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mini-gangland drama \u2026 London Heist.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sony</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This collection of short VR experiences, developed by Sony\u2019s in-house studios give a polished and varied introduction to the technology. London Heist is a mini-gangland drama with some truly astonishing moments of embodiment, while Ocean Descent is a picturesque diving experience, and Street Luge is an interesting urban racer with a quite dizzying sense of speed. Another launch title that\u2019s great for showing off the headset to curious friends and neighbours.</p> <h2>Headmaster (Frame Interactive, \u00a316)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"54f0b97550423e805d0409c39ae0680a145b3b3f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/54f0b97550423e805d0409c39ae0680a145b3b3f/50_0_938_563/500.jpg\" alt=\"Headmaster\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Football heading sim \u2026 Headmaster.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Frame Interactive</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Developed during a virtual reality game jam co-sponsored by Valve, the comedic influence of the Portal developer is clear in this football heading sim. Set in a sort of sporting prison camp players have to successfully complete a series of heading tests, using just the requisite body movement to control the ball into a variety of tests and targets. It\u2019s weird, funny, challenging and compelling, the lack of handheld controls adding to the easy, intuitive feel. An offbeat take on the sports sim that really makes the best of the hardware.</p>",
  "<p>The Obama administration is conducting a final review of its Syria policy as it enters its last hundred days, but the rethink is not expected to lead to any radical changes or significant military interventions that could bring US and Russian forces into head-on confrontation.</p> <p>The secretary of state, John Kerry, will <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/12/unexpected-talks-syria-moscow-switzerland-us-russia-airstrikes-aleppo\">travel to Lausanne </a>in Switzerland on Saturday to meet the Russian foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov, and their counterparts from the Middle East. Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Qatar are expected to attend. Iran\u2019s participation is in doubt, possibly as a result of the dire state of its relations with Saudi Arabia. </p> <p>Kerry will brief the UK, French and German governments in London on Sunday, on his way back from Switzerland. </p> <p>The ministers go into the Lausanne meeting with low expectations, diplomats said. The best of the likely outcomes would be a humanitarian pause in the bombing of eastern Aleppo for two or three days to allow some basic humanitarian supplies to reach the embattled rebel-held districts, home to 275,000 people. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/12/ground-down-by-savagery-the-agony-of-aleppo\">Ground down by savagery \u2013 the agony of Aleppo</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The US state department said Kerry would also use the meeting in Lausanne for side meetings on the mounting civilian death toll from the conflict in Yemen, and in particular the Saudi investigation into the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/08/saudi-led-coalition-airstrike-hit-yemen-funeral-officials-say\">coalition bombing of a funeral hall</a> in Sana\u2019a on Saturday. Human Rights Watch said the bomb used in the airstrike, which killed more than 140 people, was made in the US.</p> <p>Officials in Washington are downbeat about the chances that such short truces in Syria, even if agreed, will ever be implemented. One European diplomat said Moscow was in no mood for compromise because it felt a military victory was possible. </p> <p>\u201cThey don\u2019t care whatever we say about humanitarian law. Obviously they believe that they can win, that the Syrians can win on the ground. They believe Aleppo can fall,\u201d the diplomat said. </p> <p>Lavrov said he wanted a smaller meeting in Lausanne to allow for \u201cbusinesslike\u201d discussions among countries with direct influence on the course of the conflict, rather than the much larger forum of the International Syria Support Group. </p> <p>Kerry\u2019s flight to Switzerland comes only 12 days after he called <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/03/us-russia-syria-bombing-campaign-aleppo\">an end to bilateral talks</a> with Russia on the Syrian conflict. The state department said it never excluded the possibility of meeting Lavrov in multilateral settings but nevertheless Kerry arrives in Lausanne with little leverage, having admitted <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/01/syria-strikes-audio-john-kerry-russia-warns-us\">to Syrian opposition leaders</a> and allied diplomats that he lost the argument inside the administration for a tougher position towards Russia and its Syrian government ally. </p> <p>The administration review began with a meeting of top national security and foreign policy officials on 7 October, after it was clear that US-Russian talks on a ceasefire had entirely collapsed. <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-syria-options-exclusiv-idUSKCN12D2B2\">According to Reuters</a>, a second high-level meeting will be held on Friday. </p> <p>Military options will be included in the review as a matter of course, but any policy likely to bring US and Russian forces into head-on confrontation will almost certainly be discounted. The administration does not see the outcome of the struggle between the Assad regime and the armed opposition as a matter of direct national security. It ranks protecting the US and its allies from terrorism as its first priority in Syria, followed by the destruction or degradation of Islamic State and al-Qaida networks. Supporting the coming offensives on the Isis hubs of Mosul in Iraq and Raqqa in Syria rank higher on the list of priorities than humanitarian relief and the political transition in Syria, according to officials who have been briefed on the policy review.</p> <p>The most likely outcome of the review is thought to be a new set of sanctions aimed at individuals, ministries and military units deemed to be responsible for the use of bunker-buster and incendiary bombs on residential areas, and the targeting of medical facilities. </p> <p>However the EU is unlikely to follow the US lead on new sanctions. The renewal of existing sanctions on Russia for its encroachment on Ukraine is due in December and is in doubt at a time when Russian counter-sanctions are affecting some EU member states after an already poor year for agriculture.</p> <p>\u201cNew sanctions? I really don\u2019t feel it on the European side,\u201d the European diplomat said. </p> <p>The belief in some western capitals that eastern Aleppo will fall by the end of the year was challenged by Charles Lister, a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute in Washington. Lister said the densely populated area could only be captured by ground troops and the Syrian army was too demoralised and disorganised to carry out the offensive, leaving Russia, Iran and the Assad regime to rely on Hezbollah and other Shia militias to do the job.</p> <p>\u201cEastern Aleppo is an intensely urban combat environment and if there\u2019s one thing we know about these militia forces, it\u2019s that they have a poor track record of offensive urban warfare operations,\u201d Lister said.</p> <p>\u201cThe key here is how heavily Hezbollah is involved on the ground, as they\u2019re perhaps the only force that has truly demonstrated a capacity for success in urban fighting. The opposition has also planned a substantial counter-offensive on pro-regime lines south-west of the city, as well as other offensives in Hama and Latakia which would seek to draw regime resources away from any Aleppo operation.\u201d</p> <p>Lister added: \u201cUltimately, the opposition\u2019s key strengths are its knowledge of eastern Aleppo\u2019s terrain and the regime\u2019s substantial manpower shortage. There\u2019s little doubt that Aleppo will eventually fall should current events continue as they are, but I wouldn\u2019t bet on the battle for the city being quite as quick or easy as the prevailing narrative currently suggests.\u201d<br></p>",
  "<h2>1) Arsenal face Bradley bow looking to build on late escape </h2> <p>Everything about Arsenal\u2019s performance at Burnley screamed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/oct/02/arsenal-arsene-wenger-20th-anniversary-burnley-mustafi\">late Wenger era</a>. Manchester City\u2019s defeat at Tottenham gave them the opportunity to make a statement and as such the pressure was on; the game was tricky but hardly impossible. They delivered a performance devoid of intensity, purpose and conviction. Only Alexis S\u00e1nchez appeared not to deem the indignity of effort beneath him. Then, in the final seconds, everything changed, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Laurent Koscielny contriving the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/02/burnley-arsenal-premier-league-match-report\">most glorious finish imaginable</a>. </p> <p>None of this necessarily means anything because every season, Arsenal find a new rhythm for a familiar riff. But recent signs are encouraging, and a visit from Swansea is precisely what they need next. Its significance is symbolic as well as routine because <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/mar/02/arsenal-swansea-city-premier-league-match-report\">this was a game they botched last season</a> amid rancour and recrimination, that confirmed another year without a league title. This time, Swansea arrive at the Emirates in a state of flux, following the unfathomable folly of appointing an experienced international manager instead of a novice. Never has ambition <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/09/ryan-giggs-swansea-interview-ambitions\">been so severely lacking</a>. Bob Bradley will make a difference \u2013 he will certainly make them tougher \u2013 but not immediately. So, Arsenal have a chance to force home the impact of that late winner and, while a win will do, they need to win wellto show the country that this time they really do mean it. <strong>DH</strong></p> <ul> <li><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/13/olivier-giroud-backed-arsene-wenger-arsenal\">Wenger: I can rely on Giroud in big games</a></em></li> <li><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/13/arsene-wenger-england-manager-backs-gareth-southgate\">Wenger backs Southgate for permanent England role</a></em></li> <li><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/10/leicester-riyad-mahrez-arsenal-interest\">Mahrez: Arsenal were interested in signing me</a></em></li> </ul>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2016/oct/14/bob-bradley-prepares-to-make-premier-league-debut-with-swansea-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/57dqf\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2805180\"            data-video-name=\"Bob Bradley prepares to make Premier League debut with Swansea \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"PLP\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-5800a584e4b01ffb8ffcb8d3\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/10/14/161014bradley_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/10/14/161014bradley.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/10/14/161014bradley_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2016/oct/14/bob-bradley-prepares-to-make-premier-league-debut-with-swansea-video\">Bob Bradley prepares to make Premier League debut with Swansea</a></figcaption> </figure>   <h2>2) Moses mishap could make room for F\u00e0bregas</h2> <p>After making <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/02/chelsea-antonio-conte-victor-moses-hull\">his first Chelsea start</a> in more than three years just before the international break, Victor Moses faces the prospect of being denied two in a row, even if the Nigerian FA has questions about the severity of his injury. If Moses is unavailable for Saturday\u2019s visit of Leicester City to Stamford Bridge, Antonio Conte may opt to abandon the 3-4-3 formation that he tested successfully at Hull City, where Moses excelled as a left wing-back. That might just open a route back into the starting lineup for Cesc F\u00e0bregas. His sparkling display against Leicester <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/20/leicester-city-chelsea-efl-cup-third-round-match-report\">during the League Cup win at the King Power</a> last month earned a first Premier League start of the season four days later, but he was swept away during Chelsea\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/24/arsenal-chelsea-premier-league-match-report\">abject defeat by Arsenal</a>, and omitted from the team who won at Hull. Conte has probably already made up his mind about F\u00e0bregas, who is unlikely to get many more chances to change it.

Under Mauricio Pochettino, they have become reliable and predictable, but in the best possible way. Regardless of who plays, there will be exuberance, intensity and creativity. But there is still a doubt as to whether such an energetic way of playing can be sustained through a season, all the more given Spurs\u2019 Champions League obligations. There must be a temptation for Pochettino to rest players this weekend, given he faces a Tuesday trip to Leverkusen and a November comprised of three London derbies and two more European ties. The problem is that West Brom are difficult to beat, particularly at the Hawthorns and, though Spurs now have greater strength in depth, Pochettino is as reliant upon his best players as any manager.

No problem. But <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/oct/03/pochettino-guardiola-eriksen-spurs-manchester-city\">Spurs did expose City</a> \u2013 to limited extent, but nonetheless. They are not the unbeatable, impregnable force that had been suggested, and have flaws that cannot be obscured by tactical genius: their defence is suspect and their midfield is nowhere excellent enough to monopolise possession such that it becomes irrelevant. As such, any team prepared to go at them will cause them problems and Everton are certainly capable of doing that. Ronald Koeman has organised their defence remarkably quickly \u2013 only Spurs have conceded fewer \u2013 and the protection <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/23/everton-idrissa-gueye-i-am-a-perfectionist\">afforded it by Idrissa Gueye</a> gives the rest of the side licence to attack. If Romelu Lukaku has a good day, he is a handful for any defence \u2013 likewise Ross Barkley \u2013 while the pace and enterprise of Yannick Bolasie and S\u00e9amus Coleman will compromise the midfield overloads of which Pep Guardiola is so fond. Alternatively, City will just wipe the floor with them. <strong>DH</strong></p> <ul> <li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/13/ronald-koeman-republic-of-ireland-james-mccarthy-everton-martin-oneill\"><em>Koeman claims Republic of Ireland exertions are \u2018killing\u2019 McCarthy</em></a></li> <li><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/11/kevin-de-bruyne-has-chance-of-playing-for-manchester-city-against-everton\">De Bruyne could make Manchester City return against Everton</a></em></li> <li><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/11/everton-oumar-niasse-ronald-koeman-roberto-martinez\">Oumar Niasse: \u2018It\u2019s really sad.

The clash of the Premier League\u2019s bottom two sides will be laden with significance for both clubs and managers.

But for all the noise about his side\u2019s new home, Slaven Bilic\u2019s biggest problem so far this season has been injuries. Andy Carroll, Gokhan Tore, Sam Byram, Arthur Masuaku, Diafra Sakho and Andr\u00e9 Ayew are all unavailable, though the return of Aaron Cresswell will solve a left-back issue that has caused problems in attack as well as defence. </p> <p>At Selhurst Park they will find a Palace side in excellent form, <em>kvelling</em> after three wins from four, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/18/crystal-palace-stoke-city-premier-league-match-report\">Andros Townsend</a> and Christian Benteke already nicely integrated into the starting XI. West Ham have struggled in midfield, on the wings and in attack \u2013 but most of all defensively. They will need to be focused and organised, because Palace will not hang about while they play themselves in. And it is not just Townsend and Benteke of whom they need to beware \u2013 the roaming pace, trickery and drive of Jason Puncheon and Wilfried Zaha completes an attacking quartet good enough to bother teams far better than West Ham.

The club\u2019s money may come from outside the UK, but its identity most certainly does not. With Walter Mazzari <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/19/walter-mazzarri-praised-for-instilling-winning-mentality-at-watford-juan-camilo-zuniga\">still getting to know his players</a> and experimenting with various formations and combinations, performances have fluctuated. Watford played well in defeat against Chelsea, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/18/watford-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report\">beat Manchester United handsomely</a> and won at West Ham, but also lost badly to Burnley and Arsenal. In so doing, they have scored more goals than every side between ninth and 20th in the table, and fewer than only four, with the form of Troy Deeney and \u00c9tienne Capoue of particular influence. If those two play well again this weekend then Middlesbrough, whose only league win of the season came against Sunderland, will be in all sorts of trouble. <strong>DH</strong></p> <ul> <li><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/when-saturday-comes-blog/2016/oct/11/working-football-clubs-coventry-city-crystal-palace\">What two interns learned from working at football clubs 15 years apart</a></em></li> <li><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/13/atlantic-league-good-european-club-football\">Would an Atlantic League be good for European club football?</a></em></li> </ul>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e460315475e692a3539477efe99ed2c5aaf8bd2e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e460315475e692a3539477efe99ed2c5aaf8bd2e/0_171_4928_2957/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u00c9tienne Capoue has thrived in a more advanced role, scoring four league goals already this season.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u00c9tienne Capoue has thrived in a more advanced role, scoring four league goals already this season.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hannah McKay/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>8) Reorganised Burnley face big test at Saints</h2> <p>Sean Dyche has deviated from his habitual 4-4-2 in recent weeks and the change has paid dividends, allowing Burnley to gain more control in midfield by deploying Steven Defour, Jeff Hendrick and George Boyd together. Burnley are likely to stick with that plan for Sunday\u2019s trip to St Mary\u2019s, especially with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/23/burnley-andre-gray-four-match-ban-twitter\">Andre Gray still suspended</a>.

But they have yet to face a side with the attacking verve and variety of Manchester United, which may test the top half\u2019s most porous defence.Liverpool have the advantage of a manager now <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/oct/07/jurgen-klopp-liverpool-energy-giver\">more than a year into his reign</a>, his side grooved into a system while United still seek one, more reliant on moments and individuals.

  "<p>Since 2001, learning disability policy has aimed to increase the choice and control people have over where they live. <a href=\"http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20130107105354/http:/www.dh.gov.uk/prod_consum_dh/groups/dh_digitalassets/documents/digitalasset/dh_093375.pdf\">Current policy</a> [pdf] calls on \u201ccare managers to have an increased focus on home ownership and assured tenancies as a model for housing and support\u201d.</p> <p>This has led to a move away from the default model of residential care to a more rights-based approach known as \u201csupported living\u201d where people have housing rights through a landlord and a separate contract for their support. This provides people with more certainty about where they live, greater control over their lives, and enables them to change support provider without the need to move house.</p> <p>Recently, however, some commissioners have started to move back to a residential care model on supposed cost grounds. <a href=\"http://www.ndti.org.uk/\">NDTi</a> has been told of five authorities where this has been given as an informal directive to social workers. More explicit is the current <a href=\"https://consultations.rochdale.gov.uk/council-wide/ac-2017-301/supporting_documents/AC2017301%20%20Remodel%20supported%20living%20offer%20for%20people%20with%20learning%20disabilities%20%20Full%20Proposal%20Document.pdf\">Rochdale council consultation</a> [pdf] which seeks a \u00a31.4m saving by \u201ctransforming\u201d supported living provision and replacing it with a range of residential care and other services.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/social-care-network/2016/sep/30/our-new-network-helps-adult-siblings-of-disabled-brothers-and-sisters\">Our new network helps adult siblings of disabled brothers and sisters</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Sadly, Rochdale\u2019s proposal illustrates much of what has gone wrong with social care commissioning:<strong> </strong></p> <p><strong>It does not understand cost-effectiveness: </strong>claims that residential care provides greater \u201cvalue for money\u201d (VFM) are not backed by evidence. An NDTi review of VFM and cost-effectiveness in housing and care (to be published in December) has found no robust evidence that residential care or large-group settings are more cost-effective than other, rights-based housing and support models. As stated in the <a href=\"https://www.nao.org.uk/successful-commissioning/general-principles/value-for-money/\">National Audit Office commissioning toolkit</a>, good value for money is not about achieving the cheapest possible price, it\u2019s about getting the best outcomes for your money. Commissioners should consider whether the impact on people\u2019s lives (outcomes) is acceptable given the savings to be made. The Rochdale consultation does not offer evidence on impact or make this calculation, only quoting the proposed cost saving. Yes, it will be cheaper to support people in large group settings because staff will be supporting more people at once \u2013 but at what outcome cost? <br></p> <p><strong>It represents short-termist commissioning: </strong>a worse staff-to-person ratio means people receive less individual attention and support. This leads to more large-group activities, doing things that others want or need, rather than having personalised support that develops life skills and independence. It risks fostering a dependence on services, as warned against<em> </em>in the government\u2019s green paper <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/272101/6499.pdf\">Independence, Well-being and Choice</a> [pdf] and further backed up by the <a href=\"http://www.local.gov.uk/documents/10180/5756320/Commissioning+for+Better+Outcomes+A+route+map/8f18c36f-805c-4d5e-b1f5-d3755394cfab\">Commissioning for Better Outcomes guide</a> [pdf]. Increased dependence would mean more cost to the public purse over time.</p> <p><strong>It does not understand learning disability best practice: </strong>it describes approaches dropped 30 years ago as if they were new (the <a href=\"https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=_pnsCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA116&amp;lpg=PA116&amp;dq=core+and+cluster+housing+model+1985&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=T1Pi6qpJeE&amp;sig=qDdJKCnhePIQrzAG0oVQDRsqWvc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiGodmR2NLPAhUBBsAKHXZIANsQ6AEIJzAC#v=onepage&amp;q=core%20and%20cluster%20housing%20model%201985&amp;f=false\">core and cluster model was discussed by McAusland in 1985</a> and subsequently widely dropped as a model of support) it confuses supported living with small group homes (which are often residential care) and does not even suggest providing independent advocacy while people\u2019s rights are being removed. </p> <p><strong>It misunderstands personalisation:</strong> it states that the council will use \u201cpersonal budgets to determine the most appropriate care and support offer\u201d. People themselves determine how their personal budgets are to be used \u2013 not the council. That is the whole point of personal budgets. </p> <p>Even more fundamentally, this proposal challenges the rights-based approach for people with learning disabilities that started with the 2001 <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/valuing-people-a-new-strategy-for-learning-disability-for-the-21st-century\">Valuing People policy</a>. In supported living, people have housing and other rights through their tenancies. In residential care, people have no right to stay in that house \u2013 care managers and providers can require them to move for service management or budgetary reasons. People have no right to control who they live with, who supports them, who enters their house and whether friends can stay over. They will never achieve paid work as the benefits system makes work financially punitive for anyone in residential care.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/social-care-network/2016/sep/15/stop-calling-disabled-people-superhuman-just-treat-them-as-human\">Stop calling disabled people superhuman - just treat them as human</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The main consultation document does not discuss these rights implications beyond noting, in the risk assessment that they exist. Care managers (the people charged with finding the savings) will \u201csupport individuals and family members\u201d around these rights. The consultation even says that some people cannot \u201cbenefit\u201d from tenancies \u2013 which suggests some people (perhaps those with more complex support needs?) should not have equal rights to others. Rights are more fundamental than this. They are not a gift that authorities can negotiate away to save money. They form the basis of individual citizenship.</p> <p>In these difficult times, councils need to find savings. If, as Rochdale claim, some people are over-supported or supported living outcomes are poor, then the answer is evidence-based commissioning and provision. Support people to move to other rights-based housing models if they want, introduce flexible support and crucially, provide people with knowledgeable independent advocacy to enable them to assert their rights. The answer is certainly not a return to a large-group, residential care model where rights are taken away and lower staffing ratios lead to reduced life chances. </p> <p>The government should act by turning the housing rights policy exhortation into a requirement and by giving the Care Quality Commission a brief to report on housing rights progress. In the meantime, the Equality and Human Rights Commission should use its proposed housing inquiry to investigate the denial of rights for people whose housing is determined by their care and support needs.</p> <p>Some 263 adults with a learning disability risk losing fundamental rights so Rochdale council can save \u00a31.4m from its budget \u2013 a saving of \u00a35,313 per person. This, we now know, is the price of people\u2019s rights for at least one English council.<br></p> <p><br></p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/social-care/\">Join the Social Care Network</a> to read more pieces like this.

Though the nation\u2019s relationship with guns is, considered globally, unusual, it has deep cultural roots.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/24/americas-war-the-killing-jaiden-dixon-and-tyler-dunn\">America's war: the killing of Jaiden Dixon and Tyler Dunn</a> </p> </aside>  <p>For many rural people, a gun is just another tool, a way of \u201cputting food on the table\u201d, an integral part of a way of life they feel \u2013 with some justification \u2013 isn\u2019t understood in the cities. For much of the public, the frontier myth and its associations with moral probity and personal autonomy (think John Wayne) leads them to view firearms as essential to the maintenance of a national sense of possibility, a sort of utopian limitlessness integral to their sense of themselves as Americans. It requires citizens to retain the primary power to use lethal force, instead of delegating it to the state.</p> <p>The flipside of armed utopianism is anxiety. As Gary Younge writes in his fine, sad, angry book, a \u201csense of fear and helplessness, the infantilised man unable to protect his family and seeking protection by the state; domestic cocoons pierced by the chaos of the street; law-abiding citizens paralysed by vagabonds run wild \u2013 is the currency in which the NRA trades.\u201d The National Rifle Association has successfully blocked any progress on gun control by tying America\u2019s historical attachment to arms to a species of white identity politics, inflected by toxic patriotism and millennarian worries about social collapse. Meanwhile, around the country, the presence of firearms turns ordinary situations lethal.</p> <p>Among the victims are many young people. \u201cEvery day, on average, seven children and teens are killed by guns,\u201d Younge writes. Rather than craft another polemic to add to library shelves already burdened with them, he has chosen a date, Saturday 23 November 2013, and travelled across America to report the stories of every child and teen killed by firearms on that day. There were 10 deaths. The oldest victim was 19, the youngest just nine. The epigraph of Younge\u2019s book is from the Swedish essayist <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/133793321\">Sven Lindqvist</a>: \u201cYou already know enough. So do I. It is not knowledge we lack. What is missing is the courage to understand what we know and to draw conclusions.\u201d By putting faces to the statistics, Younge\u2019s careful reportage seeks to supply that understanding.</p> <p>The stories he uncovers have a dreadful ordinariness. They don\u2019t speak particularly to the larger political narratives around gun violence, and Younge doesn\u2019t twist anything to make them so: none of the children, for example, is shot through law enforcement and Younge points out that almost none of the surviving relatives brings up the question of gun control. The victims are as various as the country: a boy from a Spanish-speaking neighbourhood in Houston; two boys playing unsupervised with guns in rural Michigan; a bitter, small\u2011town Ohio man who shoots his ex-girlfriend\u2019s son before soliciting that most American of violent deaths, \u201csuicide by cop\u201d.</p> <p>Younge is, of course, interested in the social and political causes of these deaths. Like many observers, he despairs of the infantile tone of much of the US commentary, with its talk of \u201cbad guys\u201d and the endlessly repeated platitude \u201cguns don\u2019t kill people, people kill people\u201d, a formulation that reduces the issue to a simplistic question of personal morality. As with almost everything in America, race is a factor. On the right, commentators work hard to fix the blame on the supposed moral, cultural or biological shortcomings of black people, by concentrating on the favourite talk radio theme of \u201cblack on black crime\u201d.</p> <p>All Younge\u2019s random sample of victims are male; seven are black. He notes, drily, that crime in the US merely conforms to a wider pattern of segregation, with perpetrators and victims statistically likely to belong to the same racial group. Indeed, Newark, Chicago, Indianapolis and Dallas, where four of the victims died, are among the 16 large US cities described by sociologists as \u201c<a href=\"http://www.nj.com/mercer/index.ssf/2015/05/which_us_cities_have_become_the_most_hyper_segrega.html\">hypersegregated</a>\u201d. He points, instead, to the brutal realities of American poverty, which do much to put young people in harm\u2019s way. Social mobility is stagnant. As he remarks, \u201cpoor kids who do everything right don\u2019t do better than rich kids who do everything wrong\u201d. The dead boys, and their killers, are overwhelmingly poor.</p> <p>The book is at its most powerful and moving when it describes the effects of violence, on, for instance, the mother of a murdered nine-year-old who, a year on, stays awake to avoid her nightmares, then finds it hard to get out of bed in the morning and drag herself to work. Though his style is unhistrionic and his arguments measured, Younge is no outside observer, but someone with, as he puts it, \u201cskin in the game. Black skin in a game where the odds are stacked against it.\u201d After bringing up children in Chicago, a city that has acquired the <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/center-for-community-change-action/theres-a-reason-black-youth-call-chicago-chiraq_b_9110960.html\">unlovely nickname \u201cChiraq\u201d</a>, because of the high levels of gun violence, Younge eventually returned to the UK with his family.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Though his arguments are measured, Younge is no outside observer, but someone with 'skin in the game'</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>His Britishness gives him an interesting perspective. \u201cIn Britain,\u201d he remarks, \u201cwhere public drunkenness is far more common, the culture feels both far more violent and less deadly.\u201d People in the UK often remark on the surface civility of American life (the use of \u201csir\u201d, the ponderous friendliness of restaurant service) and the apparently paradoxical tendency for confrontations to escalate towards the use of force, particularly if they involve uniformed authority. America is what sociologists call a \u201clow-trust\u201d society, where shared cultural bonds can\u2019t be relied upon to govern behaviour.</p> <p>The potential presence of guns in social situations is surely one driver of the national preference for brittle good manners. As the science fiction writer <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beyond_This_Horizon\">Robert Heinlein wrote</a>, in a maxim approvingly quoted by NRA types, \u201can armed society is a polite society\u201d. The question implicit in this important, timely book is whether we want to live in a polite society such as Chicago, where between 20-30% of the city\u2019s public school students have <a href=\"http://www.chicagomag.com/city-life/August-2015/How-Often-Do-Children-Witness-Violence-in-Chicago/\">witnessed a shooting</a>.</p> <ul> <li><em>Another Day in the Death of America</em> is published by <a href=\"https://www.faber.co.uk/9781783351015-another-day-in-the-death-of-america.html\">Faber &amp; Faber</a>.

  "<p>Brian Weaver is an ordinary loser \u2013 an office temp facing the sack. Actually, that makes him a rather extraordinary loser \u2013 I used to be a temp, and it was near impossible to get sacked. Brian (Inbetweener James Buckley) doesn\u2019t even know what\u2019s coming, because he is too busy arguing with a help desk about an undelivered phone charger \u2013 he received a bracelet by mistake. When he tries the bracelet on, his wrist starts to smoke and he disappears. When he reappears, he is in a parallel universe policed by fairies and populated by wizards and chicken-headed humanoids.</p> <p>That, in a nutshell, is the premise of <a href=\"http://dave.uktv.co.uk/shows/zapped/\" title=\"\"><strong>Zapped </strong>(Dave)</a>. Brian has rocked up in a pretty low-rent, part-fantasy world, just outside a pub called The Jug and the Other Jug, whose regulars are the magical equivalent of losers: a useless soothsayer, a drunken wizard and a&#xa0;half-giant, half-dwarf. The good news is, they have his phone charger. The bad news is, they don\u2019t have anywhere to plug it in, and he is trapped.</p> <p>You may have surmised that Zapped is a comedy, although you would be hard-pressed to find evidence of it. The jokes are pretty thin, and some (the one about the chicken-headed man supplying eggs, for example) were pressed into service more than once. A&#xa0;quality cast do brave battle with the material: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/sharon-rooney\" title=\"\">Sharon Rooney</a> is the soothsayer, who thinks she may have predicted Brian, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2008/apr/13/women.familyandrelationships1\" title=\"\">Paul Kaye</a> brings a certain demented verve to the wizard Howell. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/jun/15/sally-phillips-actor\" title=\"\">Sally Phillips</a> does a nice turn as evil psychopath Slasher Morgan, although the joke is mostly that Slasher Morgan is played by Sally Phillips.</p> <p>Zapped isn\u2019t dire, exactly. It is gentle, amiable and silly. There are a few good laughs and faint rumblings of a plot beneath all the nonsense. But the magical realm of Munty \u2013 for so it is called \u2013 is sketchily imagined. It looks as if the whole thing was filmed in a dusty corner of a&#xa0;decommissioned Harry Potter set. Characters speak in a jumbled mix of sword-and-sorcery tropes and modern-day phrases (eg, \u201cmy dating history\u201d), and very little of consequence occurs. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/the-mighty-boosh\" title=\"\">The Mighty Boosh</a> could make a virtue of this kind of surreal slapdashery, but here it just seems unconsidered.</p> <p>Even Brian, blasted from our world into this one by a bracelet, seemed to lack interest in his new surroundings. He just wanted to go back home, and I&#xa0;quite wanted to go with him.</p> <p>Twenty-four years ago, mysterious <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pukbzCC3cfQ\" title=\"\">black-and-white footage emerged</a> of what was supposed to be an alien autopsy secretly performed in Roswell, New Mexico in 1947. <a href=\"http://yesterday.uktv.co.uk/shows/historys-greatest-hoaxes/\" title=\"\"><strong>History\u2019s Greatest Hoaxes </strong>(Yesterday)</a> explored this film\u2019s unlikely provenance. \u201cWhere did the footage come from, and was it real?\u201d asked the narrator, perhaps forgetting the name of the programme.</p> <p>The film itself doesn\u2019t hold up very well \u2013 it looks like two men in paper suits trying to defuse a pi\u00f1ata \u2013 but in 1995, it was enough to prompt a Fox Network special and much speculation. What remains impressive all these years later is the audacity behind the stunt.</p> <p>The aliens were made by special-effects expert John Humphreys, and the operating theatre was mocked up in a flat in north London. The alien\u2019s innards came from Smithfield market. Spyros Melaris, who filmed proceedings on a 16mm camera, spent weeks sourcing period medical instruments and 1940s American bakelite sockets for his set. Sceptics said the curly flex on the wall phone in the background was an anachronism, but they were wrong. When the filming was complete, the hoaxers had to chop up the bodies like murderers and dispose of the parts in various bins around Camden.</p> <p>The fake backstory surrounding the film is just as elaborate. Ray Santilli, a record promoter, said he got the footage from a military cameraman. \u201cThe whole idea, really, was to put it out there and let people make up their own minds,\u201d he says now. When pressed, he claimed the footage he released was actually a reconstruction \u2013 he likened it to art restoration \u2013 of the original film, which had degraded, and that only a few authentic frames ended up in the final version. Weirdly, he still stands by that story. \u201cI still have the original footage,\u201d he said, \u201cand that footage at some later stage, when we decide it\u2019s right, will be made available to the public to see.\u201d</p> <p>To take part as a talking head in this programme risked a certain culpability, or at least gullibility. Psychologist Dr Linda Papadopoulos suggested public credulousness was based on the fear that \u201cthere is something out there, in the same way that cavemen feared big bad dinosaurs\u201d. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/marcusbrigstocke\" title=\"\">Marcus Brigstocke</a> said he was persuaded when the film first emerged. It is easy to think we are all smarter now, until you remember that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\" title=\"\">Donald Trump</a> is running for president.</p>",
  "<p>Fame, Rainer Maria Rilke said, is the sum of all the misunderstandings that grow up around a name. It has always been believed that Ken Clarke is the most sympathetic of Conservative politicians, a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/05/ken-clarke-caught-camera-ridiculing-tory-leadership-candidates-theresa-may-michael-gove\">rare maverick</a>, not given to cutting and trimming, and careless of his own fortunes. His reputation has been as a rough talker in a smooth party, the one human being in an otherwise inhuman outfit. Now aged 76, he has taken his chance to set the record straight by producing a book bent on proving that underneath his peacock selection of colourful hobbies \u2013 birdwatching, jazz, Formula One \u2013 he is, at heart, as orthodox and unchallenging as the smuggest of Soviet apparatchiks.</p> <p>It\u2019s hard to tell which depresses him more, poor guy: his own story, or the burden of having to speak it into a Dictaphone. (He leaves the actual writing to others.) Although he makes an unwise reference to Harold Wilson producing \u201cimpenetrable and unreadable books\u201d about politics, it\u2019s clear that it\u2019s not in his own character to think too deeply about anything. Suspicious, he says, of anyone who flaunts their roots, he is happy nevertheless to stress that he is impeccably working class, born the son of an electrician who worked in a Nottinghamshire colliery.</p> <p>His mother died in the 1970s of cirrhosis of the liver, but he disdains to go into details about the cause of the disease. \u201cI don\u2019t like to discuss these things at length because it is unfair on my mother and gives them more emphasis than they deserve.\u201d Of his wife, Gillian, whom he met at Cambridge University, and who abandoned her own ambitions in order to be his helpmate, he remarks: \u201cIt quickly became obvious that Gillian\u2019s intention of pursuing her academic career was fairly hopeless \u2026 She had, I would plead in mitigation, always known that I was going to be a professional politician.\u201d</p> <p>Proud of what he calls his \u201cpeculiarly laid-back and stress-free personality\u201d and of having \u201cthe hide of a pachyderm\u201d, he progressed from being president of the Cambridge Union to working as a jobbing barrister in Birmingham, and thence at the age of 30 to becoming an MP. After a spell as a whip for Ted Heath\u2019s government in the early 1970s, he endured a period of opposition before what he calls \u201cmy boundless confidence in my own abilities\u201d ensured that, after the Conservatives\u2019 re-election in 1979, he achieved an 18-year run of power, smoking cigars and eating good meals at various high levels in Transport, Health, Employment, Trade, Education and the Home Office before finally becoming, in his own estimation, \u201cthe most successful Chancellor of the Exchequer since 1945\u201d.</p> <p>Throughout his service as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/margaretthatcher\">Margaret Thatcher</a>\u2019s tea trolley, he professes amazement that someone with his views was consistently given advancement by someone with hers. But Clarke\u2019s characterisation of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/alan-greenspan\">Alan Greenspan</a>, the Ayn Rand-worshipping precipitator of the global financial crisis, as \u201cone of the wisest men I had ever known\u201d indicates that his self-proclaimed one-nation instincts hardly go very deep. Nor did his readiness in 1997 to run for the leadership of his party in a pact with John Redwood suggest that his differences of outlook with the swivel-eyed were as principled or profound as he pretends.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In Clarke\u2019s observations about colleagues, it's impossible to disentangle failures of curiosity from failures of style</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>To every job he was given by Thatcher, he brought the same prejudice and applied the same tool kit. Like his boss, he never met a trade union he didn\u2019t dislike. So any objection that a professional group \u2013 be it prison employees, nurses, teachers, rail workers, miners or, particularly, doctors \u2013 brought to any detail of any Conservative plan for privatisation or reform was automatically dismissed as the pleading of the pampered. A laughably inadequate account of the miners\u2019 strike, in which Clarke takes up the blase pose of not understanding why people want to be miners in the first place, presents the conflict purely as a strategic test of strength for the government, and without any sensitivity to the fact that it was, both culturally and industrially, the most resonant domestic disaster of the period.</p> <p>\u201cI am,\u201d Clarke says, \u201cthe least observant of men.\u201d He refuses at any point to extend sympathy to workers who need to organise in order to maintain their living standards, but he chooses, meanwhile, to insert a whingeing paragraph about how heartbreaking it was for parliamentary undersecretaries in 1979 to struggle along on a salary which is, in today\u2019s money, \u00a349,400 a year. When it comes to lavishly subsidised cartels, he is a bluff and outspoken critic of everyone\u2019s except his own.</p> <p>Clarke\u2019s observations about his colleagues are so lame that it becomes impossible to disentangle failures of curiosity and failures of style. From the moment <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/john-profumo\">John Profumo</a> is dubbed a \u201ccharming and delightful man\u201d, the reader must sharpen their scythe to hack through a dense thicket of transcribed cliche. The word \u201ccongenial\u201d is beaten into the ground, repeatedly deployed to describe any fellow politician whom Clarke likes but can\u2019t be bothered to portray.</p> <p>Thatcher, you will be surprised to learn, \u201cconstantly argued with her colleagues, sometimes being unpleasant and even rude\u201d. Clarke\u2019s own relationship with \u201cthe best prime minister I ever worked with\u201d was \u201crobust\u201d. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/tonyblair\">Tony Blair</a> was \u201chighly intelligent\u201d. Willie Whitelaw, on the other hand, \u201cwas not intellectually brilliant, but nor was he stupid\u201d. When Britain crashes out of the ERM in 1992, a long and pointless defence of the useless <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/jul/22/conservativeparty.politics\">Norman Lamont</a> is mounted, as though it were somehow not the chancellor\u2019s own fault that his \u201ccompletely discredited\u201d government had \u201cits economic middle stump flying through the air\u201d. Lamont\u2019s refusal to resign immediately is excused on the incontestable grounds that he was Clarke\u2019s personal friend.</p> <p>A rare point of thoughtfulness comes when he regrets that his wife was far more upset by public criticism of him than he was himself. When a comedian says on the radio that among the few things making life worthwhile are \u201cbirdsong in the spring \u2026 and the prospect of seeing Kenneth Clarke going to his grave\u201d, it is Gillian who rings the BBC to complain. But at no point does Clarke de-monologue to ask himself whether the impact of his policies might have justified those attacks, which he complains were invariably \u201csavage\u201d, \u201csynthetic\u201d and \u201cunfair\u201d. A similarly promising passage arising from when, as home secretary, he had bravely started to address the scandal of rising prison numbers is quickly cut short when Michael Howard takes over the post. A typical Clarkean coda adds that, in spite of Howard\u2019s law-and-order populism destroying all hope of progress, the two of them \u201cas ever, remained friends\u201d. Club before country, as they say in Westminster.</p> <p>Clarke\u2019s life in politics has been bookended by the decisions to join and then to leave the European Union. A hurried epilogue on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/13/ken-clarke-tory-constituent-brexit-eu-referendum-not-binding\">Brexit</a> is clumsy and shallow. Politics, he says at one point, is nothing if not a test of stamina. But it\u2019s also a test of self-knowledge.

  "<p>Dozens of Eritreans are to join a groundbreaking civil action in Canada as plaintiffs in a lawsuit against Nevsun Resources, which majority-owns the Bisha mine in north-west Eritrea, <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/eritrea-mining-nevsun-idUSL2N1CC27U\">following a ruling last week</a>.</p> <p> Two of them \u2013 Kidane, a security guard, and Aman, an administrator \u2013 spoke out for the first time about what they claim they experienced at the mine: forced labour, horrendous working conditions and a climate of fear and intimidation.</p> <p>\u201cThe mine was like an open prison,\u201d Kidane told the Guardian. \u201cThey can take you and do what they want with you. I was owned by them. We were like objects for the government and for foreign companies to do with us what they wanted.\u201d</p> <p>Kidane claims he was forced to work in a majority-Canadian-owned mine in Eritrea during his time as an army conscript. According to his lawyers, he is one of dozens of Eritreans who will be joining a historic civil action in Canada as plaintiffs against <a href=\"http://www.nevsun.com/\">Nevsun Resources</a>, which owns and operates the majority of the Bisha gold, copper and zinc mine. Lawyers representing the group have said it is the first time foreign claimants have been able to file a lawsuit in Canada against a Canadian company over alleged human rights abuses abroad.</p> <p>Kidane and Aman spoke on condition that their identities and whereabouts were not revealed, due to fears their families may be targeted back in Eritrea. They have been granted refugee status in a European country.<br></p> <p>Their testimonies follow a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/07/eritrea-gold-mine-abuse-case-canada\">ruling last week</a> by a Canadian court, which paved the way for a lawsuit against Nevsun Resources over claims of forced labour at the Bisha mine. The ruling rejected arguments put forward by the Vancouver-based mining company that the case should be heard in Eritrea rather than Canada. The accounts offered by Kidane and Aman will be used by lawyers for the plaintiffs as evidence in the ongoing case.</p> <p>The civil action, which began in 2014, was taken on behalf of Eritrean workers by Canadian law firms CFM Lawyers and Siskinds LLP, and backed by the Canadian Center for International Justice and Human Rights Concern Eritrea. Nevsun owns 60% of the Bisha Mine Sharing Company, which owns and operates the mine. The other 40% is owned by the Eritrean government.</p> <p>The lawsuit claims that Nevsun engaged Eritrean-run contractors and the military to build the mine\u2019s facilities. It is claimed that the companies and the army forced Eritreans to work in abhorrent conditions.</p> <p>None of the accusations have been proven in court. </p> <p>Nevsun, which had revenues of $357m (\u00a3291m) in 2015, and earlier this year expanded its operations in Eritrea, denies the allegations in the lawsuit and says the mine is a model development. In legal filings, the company said the Eritrean military did not provide labour to the mine. Even if it, did, the company argues, Nevsun was not directly responsible for employing the workers. In public statements, Nevsun has said it has a screening process to ensure no conscripts work at the mine.</p> <p>In its response to the ruling on 6 October, by the supreme court of British Columbia, Nevsun said it was studying the court\u2019s decision and is considering an appeal. In a statement, the company said the decision addressed only preliminary legal challenges: \u201cThe judgment makes no findings with respect to the plaintiffs\u2019 allegations, including whether any of them were in fact at the Bisha mine. The judge also emphasised that the case raises novel and complex legal questions, including on international law, which have never before been considered in Canada.\u201d</p> <p>In a separate email to the Guardian, a Nevsun spokesperson referred to two independent human rights impact audits. He said they showed the company had adhered to international best practices, adding: \u201cAs the bulk of [the Guardian\u2019s] inquiries \u2026 relate to a legal action that is currently before the courts, we are unable to make any comments.\u201d</p> <p>The government of Eritrea did not respond to requests for a response to the ruling.</p> <p>The judge\u2019s ruling referred to the findings of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/08/un-commission-eritrea-international-criminal-court-hague\">June inquiry into human rights in Eritrea by the UN</a>, which found that the government, a military dictatorship, had been responsible for crimes against humanity \u2013 including an indefinite period of national service \u2013 since assuming control in 1991.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=20067&amp;LangID=E\">2016 report by the UN commission of inquiry on human rights in Eritrea</a> said it had \u201creasonable grounds\u201d to believe that the national security office \u201c<a href=\"http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=20067&amp;LangID=E\">is responsible for most cases of arbitrary arrest</a>, enforced disappearance and torture in official and unofficial detention centres\u201d in the country.</p> <p>Joe Fiorante QC, lead counsel for the plaintiffs at CFM Lawyers, said of the preliminary judgment last week: \u201cIt\u2019s a huge step forward to hold Nevsun accountable to what our clients allege are very serious breaches of basic human rights. To date, there has been no accountability in Eritrea. It opens the door to a hearing in a court of law in a country where the rule of law governs.\u201d</p> <p>Kidane and Aman claim they worked at the mine between 2007 and 2014 for as little as a dollar a day with no freedom of movement, and faced imprisonment and harsh penalties for transgressions. They allege that state security officers were present at the mine and say this is corroborated by official documents at Bisha. The plaintiffs claim they were fearful of these officers because they suspected some were employed to spy on workers. They also say there are records of conscripts working at the mine as recently as 2014.</p> <p>Another worker, who also spoke to the Guardian last week but is not a plaintiff in the case, claimed he was abducted at his workplace, imprisoned in solitary confinement and tortured so badly he was unable to walk.</p> <p>Interviewed in a hotel in a European capital, the two new plaintiffs described what their alleged experiences as government conscripts at Bisha mine.</p> <p>Aman, 32, said he was conscripted by the army when he was 20 and assigned to work at Segen, an Eritrean government construction firm. He claimed he was </p> <p>sent to Bisha mine, hundreds of kilometres from his family, in 2009. </p> <p>\u201cLife was very harsh,\u201d he said. \u201cThere were sandstorms 24 hours [a day], the temperature was 38C [100F] or 40C. We never had full stomachs. My work was constant.\u201d </p> <p>Aman said he worked at Bisha as an administrator for five years, working six and a half days a week, fed only lentil broth and bread and paid $28 a month. \u201cIt devoured my youth,\u201d he said. \u201cWe were prisoners. If we were free, we could have looked for a job with better pay.\u201d</p> <p> Aman\u2019s wife, who lived two days\u2019 travel from the mine, was very sick, he said, but he was refused sufficient leave to visit her and had no money to take her to hospital. \u201cI said to them, \u2018My wife is very ill \u2013 she may die.\u2019 They would say, \u2018You think you are the only one with problems?\u2019 I could not see her and take her to hospital. I had no money to pay to take her there.\u201d</p> <p>Aman said he finally escaped from the mine in 2014 and fled to Europe. \u201cI\u2019m not surprised by the Eritrean government, as they already use conscripts as slave labour. It is accepted as normal,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the Canadian company should know better.\u201d</p> <p>The Guardian tried to contact Segen via and email and telephone but received no comment on the allegations.</p> <p>Kidane, 37, a father of two from northern Eritrea, also alleged abuses at the mine. He said he worked at the checkpoint at Bisha mine between 2007 and 2013 and was employed by Eritrea\u2019s defence ministry.</p> <p>\u201cThe helicopter used to come twice a week to take the gold away,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we were not given enough money for a bar of soap.\u201d</p> <p>After his father died and he was refused permission to attend a religious memorial ceremony, he left the mine without permission and went into hiding for four months. He was punished with two months\u2019 imprisonment. On another occasion, when he failed to recognise a government figure at the checkpoint, he was imprisoned for two months in solitary confinement.</p> <p>The Guardian also spoke to a third Eritrean, who claims he worked for Senet, a South Africa-based company contracted by Nevsun at Bisha mine.</p> <p>Although not a plaintiff in the ongoing case, he said he is considering legal action against Nevsun, claiming he was abducted and tortured while working at the mine.</p> <p>He alleges that he was subjected to months of being followed and intimidated by government agents at the mines after a series of minor workplace disputes with his superiors and other workers. </p> <p>Solomon, 29, said he was abducted at gunpoint from Bisha mine, thrown into solitary confinement, tortured with electric shocks and beatings, and accused of being a spy.</p> <p>He said he still suffers psychologically and physically from his ordeal.</p> <p>\u201cIf a company employs you, [it should] follow up when you disappear from the workplace \u2026 But that is not what happened. They should have protected me.\u201d</p> <p>A South African former employee of the mine, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said it was known among local workers that Solomon had disappeared. </p> <p>\u201cHe just didn\u2019t arrive for work one day,\u201d said the employee. \u201cWe started asking other workers and they said he had been taken. I spoke to the security manger. They claimed to have investigated but hadn\u2019t found out anything.\u201d </p> <p>Asked for a response to Solomon\u2019s allegations, Pieter Theron, project director of Senet, said: \u201cThere is an ongoing legal case at the Canadian supreme court and therefore we are not prepared to make any statements.\u201d</p> <p><em>Names have been changed to protect identities</em></p> <ul> <li><em>This article was amended on 17 October 2016 to add the names of the law firms involved in the case. </em><br></li> </ul>",

class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The solicitor general, <strong>Justin Gleeson,</strong> has revealed he has ignored <strong>George Brandis</strong>\u2019<strong>s</strong> direction to seek consent before giving legal advice because he regarded it as invalid.<br></p> <p>In a parliamentary committee hearing on Friday, Gleeson said he had decided to ignore the direction in order to give urgent legal advice about the composition of the Senate sought from him this week.<br></p> <p>He also revealed that the prime minister had sought advice from him in January which was confidential and did not go through the attorney general. Gleeson did not reveal the legal issue in question but raised it as an example where seeking Brandis\u2019s consent would not be appropriate.<br></p> <p>In a fiery committee hearing the deputy chair, <strong>Ian Macdonald</strong>, cut off Gleeson\u2019s answers and subjected him to aggressive questions about why he had revealed disagreements with the attorney general about legal advice and told the shadow attorney general he had not been consulted about the direction.<br></p> <p>Gleeson described Brandis\u2019s direction as \u201ca radical change in practice\u201d that had caused him to \u201clie awake at night\u201d since it was made on 5 May. The direction made running his office \u201cexceptionally difficult\u201d, and imposed a condition on him not faced by any solicitor general for 100 years, he said.<br></p> <p>He also revealed that on Thursday a senior lawyer in the Australian government solicitor sought urgent advice about the composition of the Senate. The request contained questions raised by the attorney general but was not accompanied with consent.<br></p> <p><strong>\u201cYesterday I was faced with situation where I would have to say \u2018Go away \u2013 you don\u2019t have a consent,\u2019 \u201d he said.<br></strong></p> <p><strong>\u201cI have come to the view that the direction is invalid.\u201d </strong></p> <p>He explained it prevented him from giving legal advice to other parts of the commonwealth government when acting as counsel, a duty under the Law Officers Act, without the attorney general\u2019s consent.</p> <p>Gleeson said <strong>he decided to meet the AGS lawyer in defiance of the direction </strong>to begin work on a legal opinion, as the matter was urgent and that is what an efficient counsel would do.</p> <p>He acknowledged that ignoring the direction could result in Brandis seeking an injunction to prevent him providing advice without consent. The direction is likely to be struck down by the Senate after 8 November, when the committee reports.</p> <p>The solicitor general revealed that when contacted by the shadow attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, in June during the caretaker period, Gleeson said that he believed he had not been consulted about the direction and he did not agree with it.</p> <p>Gleeson said the Law Officers Act meant he had a legal duty to do so. It was proper because the direction was a major policy decision, had required Brandis to certify he had consulted Gleeson, and Gleeson had already warned he did not believe he had been.</p> <p>Gleeson said that he wrote to the attorney general and his department before the election to have the direction withdrawn but Brandis said he would not discuss it until after the election.</p> <p>\u201cThe attorney general has refused to engage with me on this topic despite knowing my concerns,\u201d he said, adding one would expect a substantive response.</p> <p>If the 2 July election had produced a hung parliament, the direction would mean the second law officer would need to seek consent from the attorney general before giving advice to the governor general, Gleeson said.</p> <p>Brandis maintains that he did consult Gleeson at a meeting on 30 November at which the pair discussed the procedure for providing advice, but Gleeson said the attorney general did not seek the solicitor general\u2019s opinion before making the binding direction.</p> <p>Gleeson testified that a public statement Brandis made about the constitutionality of the government\u2019s citizenship bill neglected to include his qualifications to the opinion, and quoted his advice on an earlier version of the bill, not the one presented to parliament.</p> <p>\u201cThe bill, as introduced on 23 June [2015] \u2026 contained two elements I had never been asked to advise on: about ministerial discretion, and the abolition of any requirement of natural justice,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Gleeson explained that constitutional advice should be sought from the solicitor general because he or she has access to confidential legal advice provided to the commonwealth over a century and would have to defend legislation in court.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-10-14T02:35:15.076Z\">at 3.35am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-58003df0e4b016012389597f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-14T02:14:25.854Z\">3.14am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Gleeson</strong> says he has tried to talk to the AG about the matter.</p> <p>After the election, Gleeson wrote on 16 July to Brandis and received no response.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The attorney general has refused to engage with me on this topic despite knowing the detail of my concerns. </p> </blockquote> <p><strong>O\u2019Sullivan</strong> says given Gleeson has tried to avoid politics, he must have known by talking to Dreyfus he would create \u201ca political shit storm\u201d.</p> <p>Chaos ensues.</p> <p>Gleeson says: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I thought the right thing to do was to answer honestly that question.</p> </blockquote> <p>(Here is the difference between traditional bureaucracy and modern politics.

  "<p>Moschino recently launched its spring/summer 2017 \u201cCapsule\u201d Collection \u2013 a colourful take on the word capsule, with the line inspired by prescription drugs. On sale in upmarket US department stores, it has drawn fervid criticism for making drugs look cool, funny and chic.</p> <p>The Jeremy Scott-designed collection features massive orange drug-bottle bags ($950), silver bags resembling giant blister packs, iPhone cases in the shape of pill bottles, T-shirts shouting, \u201cJust say MoschiNO\u201d, an orange drug-bottle minidress ($995) emblazoned with the words, \u201cWARNING! Do not take medication on an empty stomach,\u201d and, \u201cKEEP ALL CAPSULES OUT OF THE REACH OF CHILDREN\u201d. The invitation for last month\u2019s show was a pill bottle and a handwritten \u201cprescription\u201d.</p> <p>Doctors, addiction specialists and parents of overdose victims have spoken publicly about their anger that the collection has been launched when the US is experiencing a crisis in opioid addiction and deaths from overdose. There are <a href=\"https://www.change.org/p/marc-metrick-saks-fifth-avenue-marcello-tassinari-moschino\">petitions to have the articles removed from public sale</a>. One signatory, a nurse, wrote: \u201cYour willingness to profit off this epidemic that\u2019s killing thousands astounds me.\u201d Another entry from someone describing themselves as \u201cparents of loss due to opioid overdose\u201d reads: \u201cShame on these company CEOs and [their] buyers.\u201d Nordstrom has now <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2016/10/07/nordstrom-moschino-drug/\">pulled the collection from its stores</a>.</p> <p>Moschino and Scott both have a history of provocative branding. Pills were a motif on Scott\u2019s own autumn/winter line in 2011 and, this February, he showed a collection inspired by cigarettes. Neither met overt controversy. Here, the line doesn\u2019t reference brand names or specific drugs \u2013 it\u2019s just pills. Or, is it?</p> <p>Scott <a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/style/people-are-not-happy-with-moschinos-new-pill-themed-fare-183139897.html\">says</a> in his defence: \u201cIt\u2019s literally a collection of capsules!\u201d Bear with him. \u201cAnd when Jacqueline Susann wrote Valley of the Dolls, she called capsule [pills] \u2018dolls\u2019.\u201d So, within one line, the motifs are at once innocuous and a clear reference to a book about women\u2019s reliance on stimulants, antidepressants and sleeping pills. It seems a little \u2026 confused.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5cfb9d1c274cee4f0bbffd7df228b8409eafb032\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5cfb9d1c274cee4f0bbffd7df228b8409eafb032/0_482_2362_2133/1000.jpg\" alt=\"There has been public anger at Moschino\u2019s pill-inspired collection.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"903\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">There has been public anger at Moschino\u2019s pill-inspired collection.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristan Fewings/Getty Images for Moschino</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Moschino has defended the collection. In <a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/us/2016/10/05/italian-fashion-line-under-fire-for-selling-drug-themed-clothing-at-nordstrom-saks.html\">an email to Fox News</a>, its says: \u201cThere was never any intent to promote prescription drug abuse \u2026 We are disheartened to hear that there has been a misunderstanding of the underlying theme of the collection.\u201d</p> <p>Ah, a \u201cmisunderstanding\u201d. And therein lies the layer of sickliness that so often underpins dissent in fashion: the idea that, if you are upset by something, you don\u2019t get the joke. If you don\u2019t live in the fashion world, you couldn\u2019t possibly get it. The word misunderstanding says: \u201cIt\u2019s obviously not for you, then.\u201d Only, it is for us. These clothes are on sale to the general public in massive mainstream stores.</p> <p>Clever satire in fashion is powerful. Alexander McQueen did it in 2009 with his final collection, The Horn of Plenty \u2013 couture made from rubbish, in which models wore plastic bags on their heads. It was a comment on the absurdity of capitalism, and it ruffled plenty of industry feathers. Here, the joke just seems to be on anyone who isn\u2019t laughing.</p> <p>The implication in the fallout from this Moschino collection is that, in our outrage, we have got Scott all wrong. We have got him wrong a lot, it seems. In 2012, Adidas pulled the release of the Jeremy Scott x Adidas Roundhouse Mid \u201cHandcuffs\u201d \u2013 a trainer with a yellow chain and heel cuff \u2013 after a widespread outcry that it symbolised slavery and promoted racism. \u201cThe design is nothing more than [the designer] Jeremy Scott\u2019s outrageous and unique take on fashion and has nothing to do with slavery,\u201d read Adidas\u2019s statement. \u201cMove on,\u201d basically.</p> <p>Scott\u2019s vision was questioned again following his spring summer 2013 collection with Adidas Originals \u2013 a series of dresses, tracksuits and shoes plastered with cartoonish renderings of Pacific Northwest Native American carvings, or \u201ctotem pole prints\u201d as some commentators described them. Accused of blithe ethnic tokenism and parroting deep-rooted symbolism, the collection upset the Native American community. No statement was made but, again, Adidas did not make the collection available to the public.</p> <p>The Capsule Collection might be tongue-in-cheek, but is it smart? For many, it is a pond-bottom display of poor taste. To a fashion cynic, it is controversy-by-numbers. Historically speaking, Scott is living up to his \u201coutrageous and unique\u201d status.</p> <p>Can we give him the benefit of the doubt? It is unlikely that he, or his team, sat down and said: \u201cLet\u2019s promote addiction!\u201d But where did context come into those conversations? What is a T-shirt made to look like a pill bottle trying to say about drug culture?</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/drug-use-illegal.htm\">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a> says that, in 2014, more people died from drug overdoses than any year on record. Drug overdose is the leading cause of accidental death in the US. At least half of all opioid overdose deaths involve a prescription opioid such as OxyContin or Vicodin. The overprescribing of opioids across the country is blamed for propelling some addicts to using heroin. A recent <a href=\"http://www.vice.com/en_uk/video/dopesick-fentanyl-deadly-grip\">film by Vice</a> explores the deadly grip of fentanyl (a prescription painkiller 50 to 100 times more potent than morphine) and how addiction can make ribbons of people\u2019s lives. </p> <p>If your life has been affected by drug addiction, personally or peripherally, the, \u201cIt\u2019s literally a collection of capsules!\u201d declaration may curdle. For some, this particular punchline is likely to be lost like an empty box to the recycling.\u201d<br></p> <p><em>Anxiety for Beginners by Eleanor Morgan is out <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Anxiety-Beginners-Investigation-Eleanor-Morgan/dp/1509813233\">now</a></em></p>",

It\u2019s easy for the young to mock. But what if that boring, predictable routine could one day be a lifesaver?</p> <p>This week one Englishman\u2019s blow-by-blow account of his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/oct/12/english-man-spends-11-hours-trying-to-make-cup-of-tea-with-wi-fi-kettle\">epic 11-hour struggle </a>to make a cup of tea using his fancy new Wi-Fi-enabled kettle went viral, at least partly thanks to goggle-eyed amazement that anyone would even want to do such a thing. Who needs to be able to switch on their kettle remotely via their mobile phone, for god\u2019s sake? If you\u2019re really that desperate for a cup of tea in the morning without the bother of getting out of bed, Teasmade had it nailed decades ago.</p> <p>Yet the so-called <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/internet-of-things\">\u201cinternet of things\u201d</a> \u2013 the current mania for connecting smart white goods to the internet, so that you can turn the kettle on via your phone as you\u2019re walking downstairs, or rely on your printer ordering its own ink when it runs out \u2013 is nowhere near as pointless as it sounds.</p> <p>It may look suspiciously as if young designers are simply inventing apps to replace things their mums used to do for them, from calling cabs to delivering pizza. But if a so-called \u201csmart home\u201d can look after a lazy 20-something who can\u2019t be bothered getting off the sofa to switch on the kettle, what could it do for people who actually need help? What if your house could actually look after you in your old age, not in the old-fashioned sense of providing a nest egg for retirement, but in infinitely more practical ways?</p> <p>This autumn, an app called<a href=\"http://howz.com/\"> Howz </a>is due to launch in the UK, offering to monitor use of everyday electrical devices in an elderly person\u2019s home \u2013 lights going on and off, kettles boiling \u2013 and send alerts to their children if it notices an unusual pattern of behaviour that might indicate they had fallen ill.</p> <p>It joins competitors already on the market such as <a href=\"https://www.canarycare.co.uk/about-us/\">Canary</a>, whose sensors monitor light, temperature and movement from room to room so that if the elderly person falls and can\u2019t get up, or doesn\u2019t put the heating on when it\u2019s freezing, or generally doesn\u2019t seem to be behaving as they normally would, then the system can trigger a warning. The kettle not boiled in a smart home essentially becomes Sherlock Holmes\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.dangreller.com/the-dog-that-didnt-bark-2/\">dog that didn\u2019t bark</a>, a potentially vital clue that all is not as it should be.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1c21ad33950d6e9a231d7b011b845b3e7ea06536\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1c21ad33950d6e9a231d7b011b845b3e7ea06536/0_310_5120_3072/1000.jpg\" alt=\"'Adult care services are now 'at tipping point' and threatening to take the NHS down with them.'\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Adult care services are now \u2018at tipping point\u2019 and threatening to take the NHS down with them.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And if you think it all sounds ridiculously far-fetched, I heard about Howz in a speech made on the fringes of Conservative party conference by an executive from good old-fashioned John Lewis, which is increasingly interested in what smart home technology could do for older people. (Howz was incubated by a specialist tech investment fund working with <a href=\"http://jlab.co.uk/\">JLab</a>, the store\u2019s initiative for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/small-business-network/2016/jul/07/whatever-happened-john-lewis-favourite-startups\">growing tech start-ups</a>.) It may not exactly be as hot a name as some of those in Silicon Valley, but then perhaps it takes a company as steady and resolutely middle England as John Lewis to see that you can do more with the internet of things than make gadgets for people with more money than sense.</p> <p>For some older people, the idea of being stalked by their own white goods will clearly feel creepy and Big Brotherish, even though there are no surveillance cameras involved (unlike the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/sep/18/security-cameras-wont-make-our-children-safe\">nannycams</a> marketed at over-anxious parents, the apps merely record data, not video images). Nobody wants to feel spied on from afar, and even information that sounds dry as dust can turn out to be surprisingly intimate. Does an elderly man who is getting up repeatedly in the night to go to the loo really want a nagging phone call from the kids, demanding that he go and get tested for prostate cancer?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/10/internet-of-things-better-made-things-smart-devices-security\">The internet of things needs better-made things | John Naughton</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It\u2019s easy to see the potential for friction too between anxious grownup children who want the house wired up to watch over a parent they feel is getting distinctly doddery, and older people who are either offended at the very suggestion \u2013 or hurt that their children would rather monitor them from a distance than drop by more often, or even ask them to move in. For every family who finds it reassuring to know someone\u2019s tracking Granny on their phones, there will be one who finds the whole idea horribly cold and impersonal, a sop to the consciences of adult children too tied up in their own lives to visit.</p> <p>Nor, of course, is this an answer in itself to the yawning gap in social care funding highlighted once again this week by a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/oct/13/social-care-cuts-take-english-service-to-tipping-point-regulator-warns\">report from watchdog the Care Quality Commission</a>, arguing adult care services are now \u201cat tipping point\u201d and threatening to take the NHS down with them. It\u2019s going to take more than fancy apps to tackle the fact that by 2030 there will be half as many pensioners again as there were in 2010, all perilously reliant on a system that\u2019s already unravelling at the seams. (And that\u2019s before the nasty surprise lurking up Brexit\u2019s sleeve: the care sector currently relies heavily on cheap immigrant labour, of the kind many older people have just voted to keep out.)</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Why not put the best minds in Silicon Valley to work on reinventing life for their grandparents?</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But if what most people want is to be able to stay in their own homes for as long as possible, then it\u2019s sheer madness not to use every weapon at our disposal. Why not bend technology to socially useful ends? Why not put the best minds in Silicon Valley to work not just on making toys for other 20-somethings, but also on reinventing life for their grandparents?</p> <p>And yes, of course it would help if families could just pick up the slack and look after their elderly relatives themselves. All this would be easier in a world where everyone had granny annexes and saintly reserves of patience \u2013 or else lived round the corner from their parents, and preferably didn\u2019t work, all the better to pop in twice a day and check they hadn\u2019t fallen down the stairs.</p> <p>But that\u2019s not the world in which we live, and there is little prospect of going back to it. So instead we\u2019re blundering on with our eyes shut \u2013 because nobody ever wants to think about getting old and vulnerable, and reliant on a harassed care worker with 15 minutes to get you fed or bathed or dressed but not all three \u2013 into a world where the state simply can\u2019t guarantee to look after older people in any half-decent manner and nor in many cases can their children.</p> <p>It\u2019s true that technology sounds like a horribly clinical answer to what is at root a very personal dilemma. But we are all, in the end, creatures of habit. There are surely few things more human than learning to recognise that quality in ourselves, and use it for our own protection.</p>",

The Minnesota Twins castaway, who started his Boston career as Jeremy Giambi\u2019s backup, became a symbol of hope, the catalyst for a turnaround that literally changed the mindset of an entire fan base, an entire city. Red Sox fan Vinnie P <a href=\"https://twitter.com/VinP27/status/785665268324466688\">neatly summed up</a> this difference on Twitter last night: \u201cMy dad always told me Red Sox would lose, somehow, someway. I always tell my kids the Sox have a chance. David Ortiz did that for Boston.\u201d</p> <p>And Ortiz\u2019s legacy isn\u2019t confined to baseball. For many of us here in Boston, Ortiz\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/oct/30/david-ortiz-boston-red-sox-world-series\">most memorable moment</a> had nothing to do with crushing home runs or humiliating the Yankees. On 20 April 2013, in the first game at Fenway Park after the Boston Marathon bombings rattled the city, Ortiz addressed the crowd: \u201cThis jersey that we wear today. It doesn\u2019t say Red Sox, it says Boston.

Because he had said so many damning things out in the open, it hardly seemed necessary to skewer his personal life.</p> <p>Harth\u2019s story is a complicated one and her character, like the characters of most living, breathing women, is also complex. But her accusation against Trump was always plausible. She has stood by it for 20 years. Now, finally, Harth\u2019s account and those of women like her are not just gaining traction. They have been placed center stage in the campaign.</p> <p>Trump addressed crowds on Thursday calling the most recent allegations \u201cslander and libels ... part of a concerted, coordinated, and vicious attack\u201d, while Michelle Obama made a <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/10/flotus-speech-229741\">powerful speech</a> on what\u2019s at stake this election. If we don\u2019t vote against Trump, she said at a campaign event in Manchester, New Hampshire, \u201cWe\u2019re telling our sons that it\u2019s OK to humiliate women\u201d. It\u2019s not just the sexual assault allegations, she explained, though they cannot be marginalized. It\u2019s about Trump\u2019s entire world view. \u201cWhat\u2019s more, strong men,\u201d Obama said, \u201cmen who are truly role models, don\u2019t need to put down women to make themselves feel powerful\u201d.<br></p> <p>Women know this. Americans know this. Why then did it take <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Donald Trump</a> bragging about sexual assault on video for the country to take the claims seriously?</p> <p>This is an issue that\u2019s come up before this year, and not just on the presidential campaign trail. We didn\u2019t need one woman to come forward against Bill Cosby in order to get society\u2019s attention \u2013 we didn\u2019t even need 10 of them to. We needed male comedian Hannibal Buress to make a joke about it.

He explained it prevented him from giving legal advice to other parts of the commonwealth government when acting as counsel, a duty under the Law Officers Act, without the attorney general\u2019s consent.</p> <p>Gleeson said he decided to meet the AGS lawyer in defiance of the direction to begin work on a legal opinion because it was urgent and acknowledged Brandis could seek an injunction to prevent him doing so.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/oct/10/george-brandis-to-front-inquiry-into-veto-over-solicitor-general-advice\">The direction is likely to be struck down</a> by the Senate after 8 November, when the committee reports.</p> <p>The solicitor general revealed that, when contacted by shadow attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, in June 2016 during the caretaker period, Gleeson said that he believed he had not been consulted about the direction and he did not agree with it.</p> <p>Gleeson said he believed Law Officers Act meant he had a legal duty to answer Dreyfus. The direction was a major policy decision, had required Brandis to certify he had consulted Gleeson, and Gleeson had already warned he did not believe he had been.</p> <p>Brandis said the first he became aware of Gleeson\u2019s discussion with Dreyfus was at Friday\u2019s committee hearing.</p> <p>\u201c[Gleeson] did not tell me he had [this] critical conversation ...

He said he was \u201cdisappointed\u201d the solicitor general had not yet responded.</p> <p>If the 2 July election had produced a hung parliament, the direction would mean the second law officer would need to seek consent from the attorney general before giving advice to the governor general, Gleeson said.</p> <p>Brandis rejected hypotheticals of that nature, saying it would be \u201cinconceivable\u201d an attorney general would deny a request for advice from the prime minister or governor general.</p> <p>Brandis <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/oct/06/george-brandis-contradicts-solicitor-general-and-says-justin-gleeson-was-consulted\">maintains he did consult Gleeson at a meeting on 30 November</a> about the substance of the procedure for providing advice, if not the form of the legal direction which was nevertheless \u201cidentical\u201d to a guidance note that was discussed. </p> <p>Gleeson said the attorney general did not seek the solicitor general\u2019s opinion about the binding direction before he made it.</p> <p>Gleeson testified that a public statement Brandis made about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/oct/05/solicitor-general-says-he-was-not-fully-consulted-on-revoking-citizenship-or-marriage-equality\">the constitutionality of the government\u2019s citizenship bill</a> neglected to include his qualifications to the opinion, and quoted his advice on an earlier version of the bill, not the one presented to parliament.</p> <p>\u201cThe bill, as introduced on 23 June [2015] \u2026 contained two elements I had never been asked to advise on: about ministerial discretion, and the abolition of any requirement of natural justice,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Brandis said the immigration minister, Peter Dutton, had carriage of the citizenship bill but the pair were not able to agree on it. The frequent legal advice sought reflected \u201cthe to and fro within the government as to what the features of the bill should be\u201d, Brandis said.</p> <p>Gleeson said constitutional advice should be sought from the solicitor general because he or she has access to confidential legal advice provided to the commonwealth over a century and would have to defend legislation in court.</p>",

  "<p>The first page of Tim Winton\u2019s new essay collection, <a href=\"https://penguin.com.au/books/the-boy-behind-the-curtain-9781926428765\">The Boy Behind the Curtain</a>, sets a disturbing scene. A 13-year-old boy stands at the window of a suburban street, behind a terylene curtain, training a rifle on passersby. </p> <p>\u201cHe was a fraught little thing,\u201d says Winton of that boy \u2013 the boy he used to be. \u201cI feel related to him but I\u2019m no longer completely him, thank god.\u201d</p> <p>The passage opens a surprisingly intimate essay about the role of guns in Australian life, setting the tone for a collection being billed as Winton\u2019s most personal yet. </p> <p>In spite of his inclination for solitude, Winton has spent much of his life in the spotlight. His first novel, An Open Swimmer, catapulted him into the public eye when it won the Vogel literary award in 1981, but it was his 1991 novel, Cloudstreet, that cemented his place in Australian letters. Winton has won the Miles Franklin award four times and been shortlisted twice for the Booker. His books have been adapted for film, TV and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/may/16/cloudstreet-review-opera-version-of-tim-wintons-classic-revels-in-australianisms\">even opera</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/may/08/island-home-tim-winton-review-love-song-to-australia\">Island Home by Tim Winton review \u2013  a love song to Australia and a cry to save it</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The contradictions of having such a high-profile career while working in a quintessentially solitary artform are not lost on him. \u201cI spend all day in a room with people who don\u2019t exist, and I\u2019m not thinking about any public \u2013 but once the thing\u2019s done it goes out there and it has a public life over which I have no, or very little, control,\u201d he says.</p> <p>On one reading, the boy with the rifle lurking out of sight, watching the world go by, could be a metaphor for the life of a reclusive writer. But Winton is quick to distinguish himself from such a reading. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t like to see myself as somebody who was just cruelly observing the world behind the terylene curtain of art.\u201d </p> <p>For Winton, the perceived lives of other writers always seemed completely unrelated to his own experience. \u201cI grew up with a kind of modernist romantic idea of the writer as some kind of high priest, someone who saw themselves as separate and better, which I now find a bit repellent,\u201d he says. \u201cI think that was something that was sold to us at school and certainly at university \u2026 that writers were somehow aloof from the ordinary business of life; they didn\u2019t have to abide by the same rules as other people. The worse their behaviour off the page, the more we were supposed to cheer them on. Once I woke up to that idea as a teenager, I think I consciously resisted it.\u201d</p> <p>Winton\u2019s own background was characterised by a working class sensibility and evangelical religion. His parents converted to the Church of Christ when he was a small boy, the circumstances and his experiences of which form the basis of a number of the previously unpublished essays in The Boy Behind the Curtain. As a result, when he finally did start writing, it was with a particularly industrious work ethic.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4b09a53e524dd6f42fe63d5b5f967a44db4c3e06\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4b09a53e524dd6f42fe63d5b5f967a44db4c3e06/87_91_1324_794/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Author Tim Winton\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tim Winton: \u2018There wasn\u2019t a lot of romance in my view of what writing was about.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hank Kordas</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI approached it like I was a tradesperson,\u201d he says. \u201cIt didn\u2019t necessarily involve FM radio played very loudly on a worksite; it didn\u2019t always require plumbers\u2019 crack or a hard hat and there was certainly no catcalling, but for the rest of it I went a different route.

The Boy Behind the Curtain contains a number of vignettes that reflect the imagery and landscape that characterises his fiction: hot bitumen roads through the desert; the churning ocean. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Tim Winton reads his essay A Walk at Low Tide\">  <iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/287428716&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false\"></iframe> <figcaption>Listen to Tim Winton reads his essay A Walk at Low Tide from the audiobook of The Boy Behind the Curtain (Bolinda Publishing)</figcaption> </figure>  <p>But there is also a clear political streak to Winton\u2019s nonfiction, and the inclusion of a number of more direct essays in this collection mean it\u2019s difficult to collapse the work under the category of memoir. Stones for Bread, for example, calls for a return to empathy and humanity in Australia\u2019s approach to asylum seekers. The Battle for Ningaloo Reef is a clear-eyed account of the activism that prevented a major commercial development from destroying a stretch of the Western Australian coastline. And Using the C-Word concerns that other dirty word that Winton believes we are avoiding: class. </p> <p>\u201cI think there are people talking about class but they\u2019re having to do that against the flow,\u201d Winton says. \u201cWe\u2019re living in a dispensation that is endlessly reinforcing the idea that we are not citizens but economic players. And under that dispensation it\u2019s in nobody\u2019s interest, especially those in power, to encourage or foster the idea that there\u2019s any class difference.\u201d</p> <p>The market doesn\u2019t care about people, Winton argues, and neither is there any genius in it. \u201cThere\u2019s no invisible hand,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd if there is one, it\u2019s scratching its arse.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s clear to Winton that neoliberalism is failing, but not without casualties, two of which are very close to his heart: the arts and the environment. <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"5fd6113eff1cdf643aa5e903d3d213a5c3249fbe\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5fd6113eff1cdf643aa5e903d3d213a5c3249fbe/0_0_2409_3685/654.jpg\" alt=\"Cover image for The Boy Behind The Curtain by Tim Winton, published by Penguin books\" width=\"654\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cover image for The Boy Behind The Curtain by Tim Winton.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Penguin</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cPeople in the arts are basically paying the price for this new regime where we pay no tax and where we get less public service and more privatised service,\u201d he says. \u201cThe arts are last on, first off in people\u2019s minds and I think that\u2019s not just sad, it\u2019s corrosive.

  "<p>My daughter told me this week about a conversation she had with the barista at her local caf\u00e9. Somehow the talk turned to the issue of women and their safety. He surprised her by saying that we won\u2019t have achieved gender equality until his female friends can walk home late and feel as safe as he does. This young man understands what so many don\u2019t. </p> <p>Most people accept that it is, and maybe always will be, unsafe for women to walk alone at night, so it is therefore unwise for them to be out after dark. No one suggests that all men stay home because some might attack women. </p> <p>Is it time to implement the concept that has so successfully helped to reduce drink driving? We encourage groups of young people to nominate a designated driver \u2013 why not a \u201cdesignated respecter\u201d, a man who undertakes to ensure that none of his friends threatens or attacks others, especially women? </p> <p>When anyone in the group looks like they\u2019re becoming aggressive or out of control, the designated respecter is the sober voice of reason, telling him to back off, calm down, walk away. A simple \u201cCome on, mate, she doesn\u2019t want to talk to you\u201d or \u201cYou\u2019re not groping anyone on my watch, we\u2019re going home\u201d from a valued male voice could achieve what the same words in a female voice so often fails to \u2013 respect for a woman\u2019s wishes. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/08/trump-has-crossed-a-line-his-views-are-as-old-as-misogyny-itself\">So Trump has crossed a line? His views are as old as misogyny itself | Suzanne Moore</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I\u2019m only half-serious, half tongue-in-cheek, but I have listened to survivors share their experiences of domestic violence for nearly 25 years. Our concept of masculinity&#xa0;needs to move away from a proprietorial or covetous interest&#xa0;in women towards an acceptance that men have a responsibility not to harass women and that women have a right to their own space and their own choices about how much and with whom they socialise.&#xa0;</p> <p>Young women often share with me their online dating experiences. A common issue is the difficulty men have respecting a woman\u2019s hesitancy about sharing phone numbers or social media profiles before they have got to know them. This may be because these men have no thoughts about abusing the privilege in any way, but their response to refusal can be to take offense.&#xa0;</p> <p>Maintaining such boundaries is a safety measure used by women who know that they can be harassed or assaulted very easily. Keeping personal information private until women feel safe enough to share it is a general safety mechanism, not a personal affront. It is the consequence of the fact that intimate relationships are likely to be less safe for women than for men. </p> <p>Of course, we live in a world where male persistence in the expectation that a woman will date you if you like her, or agree to form a relationship if you wish it, is portrayed as romantic. </p> <p>This can lead to men thinking that if they persevere they will not only win the date of their dreams, they will impress them with their fine romantic masculinity. Somewhere in this is the idea that the woman should be flattered, and should say \u201cyes\u201d. </p> <p>Even more dangerous is the hidden assumption that the man is somehow entitled to continue with the relationship if he wants to, that he somehow has the right to expect a positive response, if only out of courtesy. This is the fine line between an offer of romance and a proprietorial interest in a woman because she swiped left on a dating site, or met you for a coffee, or even spent a night with you. </p> <p>Women fought for the right to make these choices, and the men who impress women are those who respect that refusal is a choice, and that persistence is harassment.</p> <p>Unfortunately, another side effect of the way dating is portrayed in media and film is that some young women can mistake controlling and possessive behaviour for love.&#xa0;</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jun/22/the-focus-on-domestic-violence-is-good-but-lets-hear-more-about-solutions-than-deaths\">The focus on domestic violence is good. But let's hear more about solutions than deaths | Ivan O'Mahoney</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Those who deliver violence prevention programs in schools tell me that this is common. Some students mistake the monitoring of their phones and the checking up on them when they are with friends as a sign of loving interest. Women I see who have lived with intimate partner violence sometimes recall this type of behaviour as a warning sign they failed to recognise.</p> <p>Human behaviour occurs on a continuum. While a hurtful or threatening text message after the refusal of a second date may be mild in the harm it does, it is the thin edge of the wedge of a sense of ownership of women. </p> <p>The man who expects to find a woman to grope \u2013 or worse \u2013 as part of a big night out is just behaving at a further point along the same continuum. This is why gender stereotyping and sexist remarks are related to violence against women, and are part of our continued tolerance of the abuse of women.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"1f25a035dc4a01fb134cfe437cb64339f4355344\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1f25a035dc4a01fb134cfe437cb64339f4355344/0_0_430_649/331.jpg\" alt=\"book cover image of Blame Changer\" width=\"331\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Book cover image of Blame Changer - Understanding Domestic Violence by Carmel O\u2019Brien</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Three Kookaburras Publishing</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Young men who understand this connection, and respect women\u2019s choices, will not only increase their appeal to women, they will make the world safer for all of us.</p> <p>When women are safe to walk home at night, rather than be expected to change their plans or their behaviour to stay safe from the few men who mean them harm, then we will have made real progress in achieving gender equality.
