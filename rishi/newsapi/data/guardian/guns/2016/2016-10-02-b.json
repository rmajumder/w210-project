  "<p>It was a story that melted hearts and scrambled minds. Two years ago Robert Young was sitting on his sofa watching Mo Farah in the London Marathon when his girlfriend bet him 20p that he could not run 26.2 miles. The next day he proved her wrong. Then <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/the-running-blog/2015/mar/20/rob-young-if-you-have-a-good-heart-and-a-strong-mind-your-body-will-follow-you\" title=\"\">he repeated the trick, only faster</a>. Incredibly, by his telling, a year later he had completed 370 marathons, often getting up at 2.45am to run round Richmond Park in London before he went to work.</p> <p>Soon there were flattering articles in national newspapers \u2013 as well as substantial amounts raised for charity \u2013 while his book, Marathon Man, was published in April. In it Young explained that he had learnt to block out pain after enduring horrific abuse from his father as a child, including having a nail hammered through his foot and being zipped in a suitcase and pushed down the stairs.</p> <p>There was another painful chapter to come. In May Young began his greatest feat yet: an attempt on the Trans America record. To succeed he had to run around 60 miles a day for 46 days. But 34 days and 2,000 miles later his adventure ended in an emergency room in Indianapolis. He was exhausted, had a fractured toe and was suffering from cellulitis, a painful bacteria skin infection. But his torture was not over.</p> <p>During his record attempt Young had been accused of cheating. But instead of stone-walling, his sponsor Skins did something unusual: it turned to two independent experts, Roger Pielke Jr, of the University of Colorado Boulder, and Ross Tucker, of the University of the Free State, and told them to get to the truth, whatever the consequences.</p> <p>On Sunday morning Pielke and Tucker did just that, releasing a 101-page report based on interviews with most of the key protagonists and a deep scrutiny of the data. It leaves little doubt that Young had received, in their words, \u201cunauthorised assistance \u2013 most likely in the form of riding in or on a vehicle for large parts of the attempt\u201d.</p> <p>Suspicions about Young\u2019s attempt started when a member of the popular <a href=\"http://www.letsrun.com/\" title=\"\">Let\u2019s Run website</a>, who had hoped to jog alongside the 33-year-old Briton in rural Kansas, posted images of his race vehicle moving slowly but with no runner nearby. Quickly the issue blew up to such an extent that Young found himself watched day and night by ultra-running experts. Yet until Sunday there were only suspicions \u2013 but no definite proof. However Pielke and Tucker found the smoking gun, using the cadence data on Young\u2019s GPS watch to show he had often cheated. For instance on Young\u2019s 66th session, where he covered 25 miles in just under three hours, he somehow had a stride rate of 31 steps per minute \u2013 about 130 to 160 steps per minute fewer than he would expect. \u201cThe data will always tell the truth, that\u2019s the thing,\u201d Tucker said. \u201cAnd here it tells it loudly and clearly.\u201d</p> <p>Young accepted he made mistakes with tracking his run but still insists he did not cheat, despite admitting there were times when his GPS watch might have been inside his running vehicle. However, he had no answers for these discrepancies when pressed by Pielke and Tucker in an interview.</p> <p>There are a couple of points worth making here. While the results were greeted with glee by much of the ultra-running community, the Skins chief executive, Jamie Fuller, said he was worried about the abuse Young was getting. \u201cThe findings are clear and we absolutely accept them,\u201d said Fuller, who has ended the sponsorship deal. \u201cBut we must remember that beyond being a runner he\u2019s a human being. In my view his background means there are special circumstances.\u201d</p> <p>Only the stone-hearted would dispute that. Young has suffered enough cruelty in his life and, though he has been the author of his own misfortunes here, there is no need for others to glory in them. While cheating is cheating, the only person Young has destroyed is himself. There were no rivals on the road to cheat out of medals.</p> <p>A second point to stress is that Pielke and Tucker both praised Skins\u2019 \u201ctransparency and integrity\u201d \u2013 and contrasted it with how other sports companies tend to behave in similar situations. It\u2019s not hard to see their point. Wouldn\u2019t it have been refreshing for Sky, having spent millions funding Team Sky, to bring in independent experts to check everything is above board with their TUE requests? Meanwhile, as Pielke points out, when the BBC and ProPublica made serious allegations against the Nike Oregon Project, Nike\u2019s reaction was to withdraw rather than open its doors to scrutiny.</p> <p>Not that it has been easy for Skins, and Fuller admits to a tricky few months. \u201cWe were extremely naive,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we did it again we would have cameras 24/7 and instant tracking from multiple sources rather than just relying on a GPS and two people following Rob. It was a difficult situation when the shit hit the fan but the most important thing for us isn\u2019t the initial problem \u2013 because problems will always happen \u2013 it\u2019s what you do when they arise. In our view there are no half measures when you apply and live by your principles.\u201d It is a motto one wishes other companies would heed.</p>",
  "<p>Independent schools say they should not be forced to partner state schools \u201cwith a gun pointing at our heads\u201d, and are calling on Theresa May to drop plans to link their charitable status to sponsorship of academies.</p> <p>Mike Buchanan, the chair of the <a href=\"http://www.hmc.org.uk/\">Headmasters and Headmistresses Conference</a> (HMC), which represents most of Britain\u2019s leading public schools, will tell the group\u2019s annual meeting on Monday that the government\u2019s threats to revoke their charitable status would be counter-productive.</p> <p>\u201cIndependent and state schools cannot make our relationships work with a gun pointing at our heads,\u201d Buchanan, the headmaster of Ashford school in Kent, will tell the meeting of private school heads.</p> <p>\u201cWe hope the prime minister understands that \u2013 after all she had the good sense to outlaw forced marriages as home secretary.\u201d</p> <p>The confrontation came after May launched the government\u2019s latest education reforms, including <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/sep/09/theresa-may-to-end-ban-on-new-grammar-schools\">lifting the bar on new grammar schools</a>. But the prime minister\u2019s plans also include making the charitable status of independent schools dependent on sponsoring state schools, and stripping tax breaks from private schools that failed to do so.</p> <p>Last month, May said independent schools needed to do more \u201cso that children from a wider variety of backgrounds truly benefit from the excellent education they can deliver\u201d. </p> <p>In response, Buchanan will argue that independent schools already had partnerships involving 10,000 state schools, reaching 160,000 state school pupils, and were willing to do more.</p> <p>\u201cUsing charitable status as a stick to beat us with is both a blunt instrument and one which is unlikely to hit its target. Indeed, it\u2019s likely to erode some of the excellent charitable activities painstakingly built up over many years,\u201d Buchanan will say, claiming that HMC schools give means-tested bursaries worth \u00a3500,000 a day to those unable to afford fees.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/mar/09/ofsted-chief-criticises-independent-schools-lack-of-help-for-state-schools\">Ofsted chief criticises independent schools' lack of help for state schools</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The HMC represents nearly 300 independent schools, including traditional public schools such as St Paul\u2019s, Fettes and Sherborne.

State schools typically receive about \u00a35,000 a year per pupil.</p> <p>\u201cWe know that our colleagues in state schools often do a fantastic job with fewer resources, larger classes, more curriculum constraints and significantly different challenges and we do not presume to patronise them by suggesting we can necessarily run their schools better than they can,\u201d Buchanan is to say.</p> <p>\u201cBut with open-hearted collaboration and a flexible approach, great things can happen, and I am hopeful the prime minister\u2019s evidence-based and practical approach will prevail.\u201d</p> <p>Buchanan will also say it is a myth that at private schools \u201cpupils wear top hats and their parents are all Russian oligarchs\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cOver one-fifth of families with children at independent schools earn less than \u00a350,000 a year, and the majority have both parents earning.

  "<p>Brexit may be the greatest constitutional and political challenge facing Britain in living memory; but Theresa May is determined that it must not dominate the Conservatives\u2019 annual conference in Birmingham this week.</p> <p>Instead, she wants her ministers to get down to the business of creating what giant banners throughout the conference centre call \u201ca Britain that works for all\u201d.</p> <p>That\u2019s why the prime minister took the unusual step of addressing the party faithful at the start of the gathering, in addition to the traditional end-of-conference rallying cry on Wednesday, to reassure them she has no intention of backsliding on Brexit \u2013 and, she hopes, to set the issue aside for the next few days.</p> <p>With that aim in mind, May <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/02/brexit-theresa-may-prioritises-immigration-curbs-over-free-movement\">told her party three things</a> about how she hopes to ensure that \u201cBrexit means Brexit, and we will make a success of it\u201d \u2013 words that have become her catchphrase since the 23 June referendum, but which still raised enthusiastic applause from delegates.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/02/beware-brexit-three-blind-mice-nick-herbert\">Don't trust Brexit 'three blind mice', says Tory former minister</a> </p> </aside>  <p>First, she will trigger article 50, and the formal process of negotiating an exit, by the end of March. That sets a two-year clock ticking, within which time Britain must agree new trading arrangements with its EU partners, and most likely some transitional agreement that would apply until Brexit formally happens.</p> <p> Secondly, she plans to pass a grandly titled \u201cGreat Repeal Act\u201d in the new year. It will strike down the 1972 legislation that took the UK into the European community, as it was then, and enshrine the so-called acquis, the body of EU legislation, in UK law so that control of it will be returned to Westminster at the moment of Brexit. </p> <p>That\u2019s aimed at providing stability for businesses, by maintaining the status quo for the time being, while opening up the possibility that legislation originating with the EU could be unpicked over time.</p> <p>This Great Repeal Act, which at the outset will do little more than replicate EU law in domestic legislation, is a pragmatic act of housekeeping: it would be simply impossible for Britain\u2019s lawmakers to run the slide-rule over every piece of EU legislation pre-Brexit to decide what to keep and what to ditch.</p> <p>Yet May is keen to satisfy what her Brexiteer colleagues saw as a key part of the appeal of the Vote Leave campaign: the urge to \u201ctake back control\u201d from Brussels. So she painted the Great Repeal Act as returning Britain to being a \u201cfully independent, sovereign country\u201d. </p> <p>But she was quick to pledge that she had no intention of unpicking EU law in one key area in which Brexiteers whinge about Brussels bureaucracy: workers\u2019 rights. That promise undercuts one of the key warnings of remain campaigners in the run-up to the referendum, that hard-won freedoms including maternity rights and paid holidays could be up for grabs if Britain voted to leave.</p> <p> Thirdly, May repeatedly said she would not give a running commentary on Brexit negotiations or set out Britain\u2019s demands in advance. That was a mistake that her allies feel David Cameron made in his ill-fated EU renegotiations last winter. </p> <p>But May does want to make clear that regaining control over migration is key. However, senior politicians across the EU have repeatedly made clear they believe unfettered freedom of movement to be an indivisible element of the single market, and most experts believe Britain will have to pay some price for \u201ctaking back control\u201d of migration.</p> <p>May herself refused to accept a trade-off between Britain\u2019s economic relationship with the EU after Brexit and the ability to decide who comes to live and work here. Instead, she said, she hopes to negotiate \u201cthe kind of mature, cooperative relationship that close friends and allies enjoy\u201d.</p> <p>Anyone who has witnessed the hard-nosed tit-for-tat of global trade negotiations over recent years, or the uncompromising way in which the EU has handled the many rounds of brutal bailout talks with Greece, knows that appeals to friendship and maturity are unlikely to cut much ice in Brussels, or indeed at the World Trade Organisation\u2019s HQ in Geneva.</p> <p>May knows that very well, too, but she will hope that by flourishing her Great Repeal Act, and setting a hard deadline for Brexit, she has done enough to quieten the grumblings from her own backbenches \u2013 and allow her to switch attention this week to her real political project, to occupy the political centre ground.</p>",
  "<p>The slogan around the hall read \u201cA country that works for everyone\u201d. Though not for David Cameron.

From now on, all EU law will become British law until some of it isn\u2019t.\u201d One thing Brexit certainly will mean is a field day for lawyers. \u201cThere is no choice between a hard Brexit and a soft Brexit,\u201d Snow White concluded.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/02/brexit-theresa-may-prioritises-immigration-curbs-over-free-movement\">Brexit: Theresa May prioritises immigration curbs over single market</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Well, there isn\u2019t now, as she made it clear that a hard Brexit was the only Brexit on the table. We would be going into all negotiations determined to get whatever it was it turned out we wanted and, if we didn\u2019t, the EU could just sod off. The single market; who cares?</p> <p>Snow White\u2019s words should have been music to David Davis\u2019s ears, but Grumpy was even Grumpier than usual. Grumpy doesn\u2019t like having his thunder stolen and is much more comfortable being the wronged outsider than actually being expected to do something constructive.</p> <p>Grumpy had nothing really to add to anything Snow White had said, but he said it again anyway to fill up time. This wasn\u2019t the barnstorming speech he had imagined the day before. \u201cWe just need to be positive in our thinking,\u201d he said, grumpily. The key to Brexit was the Power of Grumpily Positive Thinking and Paul McKenna\u2019s mind control.</p> <p>Next up was Dopey. Priti Patel was not entirely sure why she had been lumped in to the Brexit session and Snow White had not had the heart to tell her it was because she was so boring and a bit dim and she had to be sneaked in somewhere. Dopey used her 15 minutes to pledge \u00a3750m to Afghanistan. \u201cBut don\u2019t worry,\u201d she added. \u201cI\u2019ve managed to cut it down from \u00a31.5bn.\u201d Dopey considers the brief of international development minister to be do as little as possible to anyone. Keep Britain\u2019s money British and all that.</p> <p>The last of the dwarves to appear was Happy. Boris Johnson only knows he\u2019s alive when he\u2019s got people laughing at his gags, so he began by telling a story making fun of the Russians. It went down well in the hall, but probably won\u2019t go a long way to helping resolve the crisis in Syria. Happy then continued on the Snow White script. Britain just needed to be confident. Don\u2019t listen to the \u201cgloomadon poppers\u201d. The rest of the world needed Britain far more than we needed them. Foreigners were basically a bit thick and useless compared with us and Britain was singlehandedly responsible for everything good that had ever happened anywhere. Don\u2019t worry about a thing. The world loves us and owes us a living. The world may not see it that way but it made Happy happy.</p>",
  "<p>The prime minister gripped the biggest issue facing the country on Sunday. Controlling the party conference will be easier than finding an outcome for the Tories to agree on. From 23 June until Sunday there was no steady state for UK relations with the EU. The EU referendum was catalytic. It propelled Britain towards the exit door, but it left Britain with a prime minister who was unable to describe her ideal outcome as she took the country through it. In the increasingly unstable interim, those in the Conservative party who seek the most severe rupture have been emboldened. They could not dictate the terms of Brexit to the prime minister, but they could limit her options by fomenting a climate of Europhobia and generating demands at such a rate that it becomes easier to yield than to resist. It was the same game that hardline Tory Eurosceptics played to great effect with David Cameron.</p> <p>This was why Mrs May had to grasp Brexit firmly on the first day of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/toryconference\" title=\"\">Conservative conference</a> in Birmingham. It was why she told the Sunday Times and the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr show that she intends a \u201cgreat repeal bill\u201d \u2013 a device to change the status of European regulations in British law so they might more readily be scrapped once the UK has formally quit the EU. It is why she led from the front on the opening day of the Tory party conference in Birmingham, saying that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/02/article-50-timescale-theresa-may-brexit\" title=\"\">government will trigger article 50 by the end of March 2017</a>. The plan is presumably to make Britain\u2019s withdrawal formal by March 2019, in time to abort UK participation in the 2019 European elections and giving her time to prepare for the planned 2020 UK general election, too. It is also why she tried to shift the argument away from the increasing tendency to define the options in terms of hard and soft Brexit, terms she explicitly rejected in her speech.</p> <p>Mrs May also said these things because she was under increasing pressure to clarify what Brexit means. She has not done that in any detail yet. So doubtless the shadow boxing between the government and its most doctrinaire backbenchers will continue. But she did enough to be going on with. She made it more clear than before that she will not seek a Norway or Switzerland-style relationship with the EU single market. On the contrary, her priority is clearly to deliver some of the control over borders. That is one of the things that drove the leave vote in June. She also seeks an advantageous relationship with the single market, though without joining it. This is a very big call and the detail will be crucial. It was encouraging that she went out of her way to stress that European law, including employment rights, will be adhered to after Brexit. But she also put herself on a collision course with any Scottish demand to stay in Europe.</p> <p>By saying all these things at the start of the conference Mrs May set the terms of the coming three days in Birmingham. She dominates her first conference as leader in ways that will have surprised many doubters. She also regained some of the wider political elbow room that she enjoyed in the first few weeks after succeeding Mr Cameron. In the course of doing it she also conveniently relegated Boris Johnson and the feuding Brexit ministers to the undercard of the day\u2019s proceedings. It was smart media management. But the issues are bigger than that.</p> <p>This is still a largely symbolic stage of the process. The <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1972/68/contents\" title=\"\">European 1972 Communities Act</a>, the foundation stone of EU membership, will not be pulled up immediately. Mrs May wants its obsolescence enshrined in law as a gesture of irreversible intent. But it does not bring us much closer to a conception of what Brexit really will mean. There will be some objection to the idea of passing a bill containing the presumption of a deal without any clarity about the terms of that deal. Mrs May will be challenging parliament to legislate for the idea of Brexit when the urgent task is to move from theory to practice.</p> <p>Mrs May had little choice but to seize the initiative on the European issue this week. A refusal to do so would have ended up dominating her conference as militant Brexiteers on the fringe demanded a change of heart. And the Prime Minister wants to talk about other things before the week is out. This way she has retained control of the agenda. But it is a very dispiriting spectacle to anyone who wants the terms of Britain\u2019s departure from the EU to contain some recognition that 48% of the electorate rejected the proposition altogether. The tone, as well as the content, of Sunday\u2019s speeches from David Davis and Mr Johnson did little to calm the nerves of those who want the prime minister to navigate a wise course between the most extreme appetite for separation and a realistic acknowledgment that economic and diplomatic intimacy with our nearest neighbours and allies remains fundamental to the national interest.</p>",

But this doesn\u2019t quite cut it. In the short term, the drop in sterling is already leading to job losses in flower farms in Africa, as they struggle to absorb an effective 10% price cut. In the medium term, uncertainty around the UK\u2019s future trade position means that tea and sugar farmers in Malawi or Mauritius don\u2019t know if future UK sales will expand or drop off a cliff. In the long term, there could be major disruption to the lives of millions of the very poorest if, for example, new deals open up new import routes from emerging economies that squeeze out the least developed countries in Africa.</p> <p>The government must promise that any changes to trade rules will at least do no harm, but preferably benefit the poorest countries in the world. The least developed countries already enjoy duty free access to the UK as part of EU trade rules, so a unilateral commitment to stick with this would be a start. Second, the UK should look closely at how future deals will affect the poorest farmers, and commit to avoid harmful effects and create new opportunities.</p> <p>In his Manchester speech the trade secretary also talks positively about Fairtrade\u2019s work delivering fair prices to 1.5 million farmers in developing countries. Fairtrade can only do its job if there is market access in the first place, and these same farmers urgently need clarity on the UK\u2019s intentions.<br><strong>Barbara Crowther</strong><br><em>Director of policy and public affairs, Fairtrade Foundation</em></p> <p>\u2022 Liam Fox presents a myopic view of world trade. Globalisation is not a panacea; there have always been winners and losers as the international economy develops. In the days of Adam Smith, Britain\u2019s industrial revolution destroyed India\u2019s indigenous cotton industry. China was exploited in the opium trade. Calcutta boomed as Englishmen built a European city. Indian agricultural labourers were reduced to poverty.</p> <p>Today, China and India are in an era of expansion, Britain runs a systemic trade deficit and London has become the new Calcutta: the new global rich buy up property as many of the native population are driven into penury. Nothing Liam Fox writes is wrong, it is just selective from a wider whole.<br><strong>Martin London</strong><br><em>Henllan, Denbighshire</em></p> <p>\u2022 Liam Fox correctly argues that international free trade creates increased incomes. However, he ignores the distributional effects of trade. Britain grows but with increased inequality, devastating old industries. China grows and becomes more unequal thereby currently increasing the popularity of Maoist groups. Trade has to involve the compensation of losers with welfare support, retraining and other market interventions if social harmony is to be preserved. Such investments are inadequate in Britain and China.<br><strong>Professor emeritus Alan Maynard</strong><br><em>University of York</em></p> <p>\u2022 Liam Fox writes of the \u201cbrave and historic decision of the British people to leave the European Union\u201d. But the British people en masse didn\u2019t decide any such thing, bravely or not. Even if, in the June referendum, a few more had voted to remain than to leave, the result could only have been more a preference than a decision, since no one could remotely forecast the impact of Brexit (and Fox\u2019s own government department still can\u2019t tell us).</p> <p>There was, however, a very clear message: that the country is almost exactly split down the middle in its preferences, ill-informed as they may or may not have been. Maybe once the impacts of Brexit and the possibilities of reform within the EU have been defined and digested, we should have an informed debate and decision \u2013 but not yet.</p> <p>The government has done nothing to assuage the raw emotions raised on both sides. The country remains divided (and still ill-informed), and the underlying problems that may have influenced the votes have not been investigated, addressed or solved. Liam Fox, instead of wilfully misinterpreting the vote, or trying to rewrite history, should buckle down to bringing the bruised and divided British people together again.<br><strong>Peter Davis</strong><br><em>Bath</em></p> <p>\u2022 The fact that a judge has decided (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/28/government-must-disclose-legal-arguments-article-50-procedure-peoples-challenge\" title=\"\">Early legal win for anti-Brexit campaigners over article 50</a>, 29 September) that the government should disclose the basis of its claim to prerogative power in relation to the timing and terms of Brexit is to be welcomed. But this is fundamentally a matter of politics, not law, and should be settled in parliament. It is the job of parliament to challenge prerogative power, not to be rolled over by it or to leave it to the courts.

By that stage Tottenham Hotspur\u2019s stand-in No9 was so utterly spent, so drenched in goodwill from a cooing, gurgling home crowd that, as Andre Marriner shooed him off, Son mistook the referee\u2019s gesture for one of congratulation and tried to shake his hand.</p> <p>On the bench there were backslaps and hugs for a performance of prodigious energy and craft, a significant turn not just in this <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/02/tottenham-hotspur-manchester-city-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">2-0 defeat of Manchester City</a> but in City\u2019s wider attempts to adapt to new rhythms and shapes under Pep Guardiola.</p> <p>Fittingly there was little in the way of recognition from Son\u2019s manager, who continued to leap and whirl and flail the flaps of his dark suit around like a dementedly angry wedding cake figurine, even with his team two minutes from victory.

But he is right, for now at least. Aggression, running power, furious staged pressure: this is how Premier League teams will attempt to disrupt this evolving project-team. They may not succeed. Spurs are startlingly good at this, a team geared exactly for the challenge. The pressure might even act as a catalyst for City\u2019s own evolution . \u201cFootball is a process,\u201d Guardiola said afterwards, magnanimous and, indeed, utterly spot-on in defeat. \u201cWe will just have to learn.\u201d</p> <p>The contrast in managerial method had been ramped up before the game. Both see football as a matter of controlling space. Pochettino wants to dominate it, to inhabit every crease, to breathe all the air in the room.

They were led by Son, who was sensational in the stand-in centre-forward\u2019s role here, coming on like a rabidly hyper-mobile Harry Kane, covering every space, shielding and dribbling and linking and thoroughly deserving the goal he might have had if Erik Lamela had let him take Spurs\u2019 second-half penalty (Lamela missed it).</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/02/tottenham-hotspur-manchester-city-premier-league-match-report\">Dele Alli leads vibrant Tottenham to inflict first loss on Manchester City</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Son traumatised City\u2019s defence for the opening hour with his fine, intelligent movement and an ability to take the ball with his back to goal and spin that looked entirely natural. He shot on sight, he took the ball in his stride, he produced a lovely pass for the second goal to make it six goals and two assists in his past seven league games. It has been a thrillingly whole-hearted response to a difficult summer. Son was distraught at his underwhelming part in South Korea\u2019s exit from the Olympics at the hands of a low-grade Honduras team. He might have left in the transfer window. He could also face a period of military service next year, not something easily waved aside when one\u2019s most significant neighbour is a jumped-up despot with a missile\u2011hoarding fetish.</p> <p>On Thursday night Son confirmed he had not actually played centre-forward for Bayer Leverkusen at all, although he had a few games there at Hamburg.

He twice picked a straight sprint on goal with Pablo Zabaleta, who tracked back with all the natural spring of a man squelching through a peat bog in a pair of thigh-high waders. The first goal came from that side courtesy of a horrible moment for Aleksandar Kolarov. Spurs pressed and won the ball, Danny Rose curled in a nice cross and Kolarov scuffed it off the bar and into his own net.</p> <p>After which Spurs continued to play like Spurs, on days like these a homogenised, high-intensity substance that never dips or drops or lets its fizz die away. The second goal was another fast-breaking affair, Dele Alli, Son and Lamela setting about the centre of City\u2019s defence like a Mexican flyweight throwing punches from all angles. Alli finished it nicely, tucking the ball low past Claudio Bravo\u2019s left hand to garland a fine all-round performance.</p> <p>Victory here confirms the soundness not just of Pochettino\u2019s methods but of his ability to drill them into this willing group of players. But it also confirms that City are only starting out on their own journey. Before this match Guardiola had dismissed his team\u2019s fast start as something of an illusion, born out of the players\u2019 willingness more than any really profound plateau being reached.</p> <p>Pep wants control. He wants his team to decide the tempo and texture of a match. This was a constant background mutter through his great days at Barcelona.

Pretty much never was the answer, tribute to just how good that team was at playing the way only that team really has.

  "<p>Unlike your muddled editorial (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/28/the-guardian-view-on-footballs-crisis-tv-money-is-the-root-of-the-problem\" title=\"\">Football needs to be saved from its own greed by curbing pay-TV</a>, 29 September) I am proud of English football. The Premier League is exciting and competitive. That\u2019s why it is watched on TV (yes, and paid for) by millions of football fans worldwide. I&#xa0;watched last season\u2019s exciting climax on holiday in Albania and was joined in the hotel bar by many locals who were enthralled that the title race had boiled down to Leicester City and Tottenham Hotspur and was not the usual carve up between big money, brand name clubs.</p> <p>The Premier League television rights deal helped to bring this about. So-called lesser teams no longer have to sell their best players to their privileged richer rivals. A long, gruelling season with no easy games ensures the team that wins the English league has earned it, not bought it. This partially explains why English teams find it harder to win European titles.</p> <p>Manchester United has won the English top flight title 20 times. Compare this with the European \u201cone- or two-horse leagues\u201d you laud in your editorial. Bayern Munich has won 41% of all Bundesliga titles. Real Madrid and Barcelona between them have won an astonishing 66% of La Liga titles. They control all of their own TV rights money and consequently attract most of the world-brand big money sponsors. They receive financial backing from state and regional governments. They have been involved in dodgy, lucrative land deals to earn more cash and even persuaded the Spanish government to amend tax law to help attract foreign players.</p> <p>The Spanish system is designed to keep the chosen at the top. The English Premier League came close to following this model. Now the extra money in the Premier League has changed the status quo and I am glad.</p> <p>My team nearly won the title last season and will have another good go this season with their many talented young English players. The beautiful game is thriving; even&#xa0;outside the bubble of the Manchester Guardian.<br><strong>Adrian Townsend</strong><br><em>Garsington, Oxfordshire</em></p> <p>\u2022 In a sporting variant on Andy Warhol\u2019s 15 minutes of fame, it seems possible that every English resident will in time be given a chance to manage the national football team. I eagerly anticipate my turn, although I fear that I could be a long way down the selection list, well behind merchant bankers, retiring MPs and others with proven experience in circumventing the rules in the interests of personal wealth accumulation.<br><strong>Paul Bream</strong><br><em>Wallsend</em></p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Join the debate \u2013 email </em></strong><a href=\"mailto:guardian.letters@theguardian.com\" title=\"\"><strong><em>guardian.letters@theguardian.com</em></strong></a></p>",
  "<p>One of the most common arguments against the possibility of technological unemployment (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/sep/25/our-job-now-is-to-consider-a-future-without-work\" title=\"\">Letters, 26 September</a>) is \u201cit hasn\u2019t happened in the past, so why would this time be any different\u201d. When people express concerns about machines taking jobs, they are reassured that the same concerns have been raised many times since the industrial revolution began and that they have always proved to be unfounded; while many types of work have been lost to new technology, a sufficient number of new jobs have always arisen to take their place. In 200 years of technological advancement there has never been an outbreak of technological unemployment.But that argument is just not true, because in the last 170 years there has actually been a 50% reduction in work. It\u2019s just that this has taken the form of fewer work hours, not unemployment. If we were still working the same hours people did in the 1870s, there would be a massive shortage of jobs and an unemployment rate of around 50%. Work hours have reduced in this time from 65 hours a week and four days holiday a year, to what we have now. There is nothing magical about 40 hours a week being what constitutes a normal job. There is no good reason why it shouldn\u2019t reduce further as we progress into the next technological revolution.<br><strong>Michael Berney</strong><br><em>Wentworth Falls, NSW, Australia</em></p> <p>\u2022 Janice Jowett (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2016/sep/29/give-midcounties-co-op-a-break\" title=\"\">Letters, 30 September</a>) points out that working for one company is the traditional test for employment status. There are or were a collection of such indicators to test just how much real control a worker has over their work. These include the provision of tools and equipment, whether to accept a job or not, how exactly the job is done, who pays them, does someone else control or manage elements of the work, and when do they take their holidays. All at odds with the so-called self employed of some modern practices. I wonder what the HMRC Employment status indicator tool makes of it?<br><strong>Martin Jeeves</strong><br><em>Cardiff</em></p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Join the debate \u2013 email </em></strong><a href=\"mailto:guardian.letters@theguardian.com\" title=\"\"><strong><em>guardian.letters@theguardian.com</em></strong></a></p>",

This week I\u2019m very much hoping for a cheeky Cha Cha.</p> <p>They teased us with the training footage. Very little to be seen here, but Daisy does a very good job of pretending to be excited about going bowling.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57f008a9e4b0ab0063086e73\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-01T19:04:13.539Z\">8.04pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Scores: 6,7,7,7 \u2013 a total of 27 for Judge Rinder an Oksana.

  "<p>Brazilian police have arrested a prominent community journalist in the Alem\u00e3o favela complex of Rio de Janeiro, underlining the authorities\u2019 often weak respect for media freedom, particularly when it comes to coverage of poor neighbourhoods.</p> <p>Rene Silva, the founder of <a href=\"http://www.vozdascomunidades.com.br/\">Voz da Comunidades</a> (Community Voice), was detained alongside a photographer, Renato Moura, on Saturday night as they attempted to report on the forced relocation of residents who had reoccupied their demolished homes in the Skol community.</p> <p>Police first seized Moura to prevent him from taking pictures of the evictions. Silva used his mobile phone to live-broadcast what was happening, until he was handcuffed, pepper-sprayed and taken to the police station where he was charged with contempt of authority and trespass.</p> <p>When other community activists attempted to record what was happening, they too came under assault from police using teargas and rubber bullets. Video of the start of the incident shows police harassing the journalist and knocking a phone from his hand.</p> <p>Silva said he had only been doing his job. \u201cThe police wanted to prevent our access. They didn\u2019t want to let us get there. We insisted, we explained we were media, but they didn\u2019t want to allow it,\u201d he told the Guardian.</p> <p>Another reporter, Raul Santiago, from the Papo Reto Collective, noted that such intimidation was common and <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/ColetivoPapoReto/posts/995412210585358\">called on the police</a> to stop their repression of independent voices.</p> <p>Community journalists have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/aug/02/olympic-legacy-repression-war-rio-favela\">reported from the frontline of the conflict</a> between police and gang members \u2013 a conflict that has resulted in the deaths of numerous residents, often at the hands of the authorities.</p> <p>Silva became one of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/18/teenagers-changing-world-malala-yousafzai\">their best-known figures </a>when he live-tweeted a huge military and police operation to \u201cpacify\u201d the Alem\u00e3o favela in 2010. </p> <p>Media freedom organisations called on the authorities to respect freedom of expression. \u201cAll journalists must be allowed to report freely on sensitive topics without fear of retribution,\u201d said Andrew Downie, Brazil representative of the <a href=\"https://www.cpj.org/\">Committee to Protect Journalists</a>. \u201cThe CPJ has consistently called on authorities to put an end to these kind of procedures by law enforcement officers</p> <p>\u201cIn addition to ensuring the rule of law, a key part of policing is guaranteeing the safety of all members of the media covering public protests.\u201d</p> <p>Brazil has long been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jun/20/environmental-activist-murders-global-witness-report\">one of the most dangerous countries in the world</a> for journalists, environmentalists and social activists. <a href=\"https://cpj.org/blog/2016/09/in-brazil-journalists-face-injury-from-violent-pro.php\">According to the CPJ</a>, attacks on the press have increased in the past year as a result of increasing political polarisation. </p> <p>Since 2013 there have been <a href=\"http://www.abraji.org.br/?id=90&amp;id_noticia=3593\">more than 300 attacks</a> on journalists attempting to cover protests in Brazil, mostly by police, according to the <a href=\"http://www.abraji.org.br/\">Brazilian Association of Investigative Journalism</a>. </p>",
  "<p>Do you want it hard or soft? In earlier days such a question at the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/toryconference\" title=\"\">Conservative party conference</a> would probably have been scandalous. Today it is entirely innocent, the question du jour. Does Britain sever its relationship with Europe with one drop of the guillotine\u2019s blade, the \u201chard Brexit\u201d favoured by the right? Or does it attempt to negotiate a new deal with the EU to preserve privileged access to the single market?</p> <p>After the prime minister\u2019s announcements on Sunday no one can be in any doubt that Britain will leave the EU.

But our markets on the continent did not suddenly vanish in an act of democratic will. Our businesses still export there. Inward investors with plants in the UK \u2013 major companies such as Nissan \u2013 still want to sell there, and they are worried. They might have thought of selling in Brazil, India or China already without the helpful advice of politicians that they should just try harder.</p> <p>The collective naivety about the ease of doing global trade deals or what they would entail is staggering. One senior minister said there would be a trade deal with New Zealand before Christmas. Another leading Brexit campaigner predicted a deal with India \u201cfaster than you can say masala bond\u201d. Those who talk so excitedly do not stop to consider the inevitable first demand of major agricultural exporters, which is that we drop our farm subsidies. And they clearly haven\u2019t understood that even poor deals take years to complete.</p> <p>A high quality trade deal with Australia would be a great thing \u2013 but it would account for under 2% of our trade. A deal with India would be a prize \u2013 if ever they would open their markets to us. Yes, let\u2019s try to drive trade deals on the far side of the world.

But it\u2019s folly to believe that new trade deals are a simple or swift substitute for unhindered access to the world\u2019s largest market of 500 million people on our doorstep, a bloc with which we do half our trade.</p> <p>In case we don\u2019t notice while we\u2019re \u201cre-joining the world\u201d, to use one particularly glib Brexit slogan, trade deals aren\u2019t exactly flavour of the month with the public. On either side of the Atlantic and the Pacific, big proposed deals are foundering. Voters supported Brexit less in a rush of enthusiasm for free trade than to pull up the drawbridge. Prominent Brexiteers who now preach free trade urged sanctions against imports of Chinese steel during the campaign.</p> <p>So if part of the seduction of a hard Brexit is that there\u2019ll be comfort for us across warm oceans, we need to wake up quickly. There won\u2019t be. That\u2019s why we must above all drive the most advantageous deal possible with Europe. It\u2019s not just a question of ensuring that tariff barriers remain down. The single market removes non-tariff barriers, too, while being in the customs union makes it far easier for businesses to sell into Europe.</p> <p>The ideologues may see it as obvious that we abandon these arrangements as we leave the EU, but pragmatists will want to weigh the consequences and the options. During the campaign, many Brexiteers extolled the virtues of Norway or Switzerland, countries which are outside the EU but retain access to the single market. We should at least understand the costs and benefits of these kinds of options \u2013 if not the exact models \u2013 before peremptorily ruling them out.</p> <p>If there is an emerging consensus, it is that Britain must now have more control of immigration. It suits hardline Brexiteers and European politicians alike to argue that this means a binary choice for the UK, either in the single market with free movement of labour, or outside with control over migration. But weren\u2019t we told, time and again, that Britain is big enough to drive its own bespoke deal? It\u2019s hard to see why it\u2019s wise or attractive to say that what we want from the outset is the most brutal severance with the least advantage to us and the most potential economic damage.</p> <p>The jury is out on the new government structure to deliver our departure from the EU. The so-called<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/16/johnson-davis-fox-three-brexiteers\" title=\"\"> \u201cthree Brexiteers\u201d </a>have so far rather more resembled three blind mice, stumbling around the world\u2019s capitals with inconsistent messages, united only in their assurance that it will be all right on the night.</p> <p>Business, which above all prizes certainty, is not so sure. Now the politicians who were already inclined to be deaf to business concerns have been emboldened by the apparent resilience of Britain\u2019s economy in the face of a predicted short-term shock. The risk is that important concerns about the long-term impacts of a hard Brexit will be dismissed. We may all be Brexiteers now, but leaving without being able to reassure inward investors or the financial services industry that they will be able do business as usual would be a catastrophe.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/01/theresa-may-to-propose-great-repeal-bill-to-unwind-eu-laws\" title=\"\">article 50 trigger</a> that will now be pulled within months irreversibly counts down the clock to our departure. That negotiating process, in which we are shut out of the deciding EU council, will disadvantage our country enough as it is. We should not make it even more difficult by allowing the naive ideal of a new Britannia to get the better of us.</p>",

For example, there is no such thing as a choice between \u201csoft Brexit\u201d and \u201chard Brexit\u201d. This line of argument \u2013 in which \u201csoft Brexit\u201d amounts to some form of continued EU membership and \u201chard Brexit\u201d is a conscious decision to reject trade with Europe \u2013 is simply a false dichotomy. And it is one that is too often propagated by people who, I am afraid to say, have still not accepted the result of the referendum.</p> </blockquote> <p>But May defined \u201chard\u201d Brexit as the rejection of trade with Europe. In reality, though, \u201chard\u201d Brexit is generally taken to mean a Brexit that puts an emphasis on independence, and rejects EEA (Norway) or EFTA (Switzerland) arrangements that involve retaining a measure of pooled sovereignty. May made it clear that this was exactly what she was proposing.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>What we are now talking about is very different. Whether people like it or not, the country voted to leave the EU. And that means we are going to leave the EU ...</p> <p>So the process we are about to begin is not about negotiating all of our sovereignty away again. It is not going to be about any of those matters over which the country has just voted to regain control. It is not, therefore, a negotiation to establish a relationship anything like the one we have had for the last forty years or more. So it is not going to a \u201cNorway model\u201d. It\u2019s not going to be a \u201cSwitzerland model\u201d. It is going to be an agreement between an independent, sovereign United Kingdom and the European Union. </p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>May made it clear that, although she wanted companies to have \u201cthe maximum freedom\u201d to trade with the single market, she would not accept any deal that involved the UK having to accept European court of justice rulings or EU free movement laws.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I want it to give British companies the maximum freedom to trade with and operate in the Single Market \u2013 and let European businesses do the same here. But let me be clear. We are not leaving the European Union only to give up control of immigration again. And we are not leaving only to return to the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>She said that workers\u2019 rights would continue to be protected as long as she remained prime minister.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>As we repeal the European Communities Act, we will convert the \u2018acquis\u2019 \u2013 that is, the body of existing EU law \u2013 into British law. When the great repeal Bill is given royal assent, parliament will be free \u2013 subject to international agreements and treaties with other countries and the EU on matters such as trade \u2013 to amend, repeal and improve any law it chooses ... Any changes in the law will have to be subject to full scrutiny and proper Parliamentary debate. And let me be absolutely clear: existing workers\u2019 legal rights will continue to be guaranteed in law \u2013 and they will be guaranteed as long as I am prime minister. </p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>She said that the government would invoke article 50, starting the EU withdrawal process, \u201csoon\u201d and before the end of March.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It was right to wait before triggering article 50. But it is also right that we should not let things drag on too long. Having voted to leave, I know that the public will soon expect to see, on the horizon, the point at which Britain does formally leave the European Union. So let me be absolutely clear. There will be no unnecessary delays in invoking article 50. We will invoke it when we are ready. And we will be ready soon. We will invoke article 50 no later than the end of March next year.</p> </blockquote> <p>This is marginally more specific than what May said on the Andrew Marr Show this morning; this morning it was just \u201cbefore the end of March\u201d.</p> <ul> <li><strong>She said Scotland would not have a veto on Brexit.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union are the responsibility of the government and nobody else ... Because we voted in the referendum as one United Kingdom, we will negotiate as one United Kingdom, and we will leave the European Union as one United Kingdom. There is no opt-out from Brexit. </p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>She implied that she would block further attempts to hold a referendum on Scottish independence.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I will never allow divisive nationalists to undermine the precious Union between the four nations of our United Kingdom.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>She rejected the argument that parliament should take the decision to trigger article 50. </strong>The government is being taken to court over this point, but May said Jeremy Wright, the attorney general, would be in court himself to argue the government\u2019s case. (The attorney general is the government\u2019s chief legal adviser, but it is unusual for him to appear in court in person on behalf of the executive.) She said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>When it legislated to establish the referendum, Parliament put the decision to leave or remain inside the EU in the hands of the people. And the people gave their answer with emphatic clarity. So now it is up to the Government not to question, quibble or backslide on what we have been instructed to do, but to get on with the job. </p> <p>Because those people who argue that Article Fifty can only be triggered after agreement in both houses of parliament are not standing up for democracy, they\u2019re trying to subvert it. They\u2019re not trying to get Brexit right, they\u2019re trying to kill it by delaying it. They are insulting the intelligence of the British people. That is why, next week, I can tell you that the attorney general himself, Jeremy Wright, will act for the government and resist them in the courts.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>She said she wanted a future in which \u201cBritain is always the most passionate, most consistent, most convincing advocate for free trade\u201d.</strong></li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>She condemned those politicians (like Labour\u2019s Owen Smith and the Liberal Democrats) who are arguing for a second referendum.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Because even now, some politicians \u2013 democratically-elected politicians \u2013 say that the referendum isn\u2019t valid, that we need to have a second vote.</p> <p>Others say they don\u2019t like the result, and they\u2019ll challenge any attempt to leave the European Union through the courts.</p> <p>But come on. The referendum result was clear. It was legitimate. It was the biggest vote for change this country has ever known. Brexit means Brexit \u2013 and we\u2019re going to make a success of it.</p> <p>The final sentence is one that May repeated continually over the summer. She used it again this afternoon with the familiarity of a comedian using a favoured catchphrase.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>She reaffirmed her intention not to give a \u201crunning commentary\u201d on the Brexit talks.</strong> She implied that speculative media stories about the UK\u2019s negotiating position could harm the national interest.</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>But we will not be able to give a running commentary or a blow-by-blow account of the negotiations. Because we all know that isn\u2019t how they work. But history is littered with negotiations that failed when the interlocutors predicted the outcome in detail and in advance. </p> <p>Every stray word and every hyped up media report is going to make it harder for us to get the right deal for Britain. </p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>She praised David Cameron for being willing to \u201cput his trust in the British people\u201d.</strong> May said that was her answer to those who said Cameron made a mistake when he called the referendum.</li> </ul> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57f11c78e4b05962fdf4a25b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-02T14:41:17.368Z\">3.41pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Davis says if the UK wants to be treated with good will in the Brexit negotiations, it needs to act with good will too.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57f11b8be4b015be6383365c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-02T14:37:37.333Z\">3.37pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Davis says he is \u201cabsolutely sure\u201d the government will get a deal that allows EU citizens to remain in the UK.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57f11b34e4b015be63833659\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-02T14:35:58.135Z\">3.35pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>David Davis says the UK does not want the EU to fail.

After Theresa May told Andrew Marr that she would invoke article 50, starting the formal two-year EU withdrawal process by the end of March, we now have a government commitment to a timetable. The UK has six months at most before article 50 tips us down the slipway towards leaving the EU. In theory at least, once the article 50 letter has arrived in Brussels there is no going back.</p> <p>This is a more important announcement than the overnight one about the \u201cgreat repeal\u2019 bill. It was inevitable that leaving the EU would involve repealing the 1972 European Communities Act, and the press statement from the Tories about the bill said relatively little about what this legislation would look like. But by announcing that she will trigger article 50 before the end of March, May will firmly quash the speculation that has been bouncing around Westminster about the EU withdrawal process being delayed for a year, or even more.</p> <p>\u201cBy the end of March\u201d sounds quite soon, but arguably May is announcing a one-month delay. In public, until now, all she had said was that article 50 would not be invoked this year. But in private she has been telling EU leaders it would be triggered early next year. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/16/theresa-may-likely-trigger-article-50-brexit-talks-early-2017\">Donald Tusk, the EU council president, said after a recent meeting with May that he expected the article 50 declaration in January or February.</a></p> <p>Article 50 was easily the key story in the interview, but other bits were interesting too. In particular, May sounded less evangelical about grammar schools than she has done in the past. She preferred to describe the policy in terms of extending selection, and she was very keen to stress that this was only one aspect of a policy document intended to improve standards for everyone.</p> <p>I will post a summary with the main quotes soon, as well as rounding up some reaction.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-10-02T09:33:18.705Z\">at 10.33am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57f0cc4de4b015be638334ea\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-02T09:04:04.492Z\">10.04am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><em>Q: Are you trying to restore cabinet government?</em></p> <p>May say she wants to ensure ministers are involved as policy develops.</p> <p><em>Q: Was government too informal under Cameron?</em></p> <p>May says the last government achieved a great deal.

This isn\u2019t about political games, it\u2019s about what is right for the country. I think an early general election would introduce a note of instability for people.</p> </blockquote> <p>May has ruled out a \u201csnap\u201d election before, and argued that there is \u201cno need\u201d for an election before 2020. But if May is now saying an early election would introduce \u201cinstability\u201d, then it would be harder for her to justify changing her mind on why there might be a need for a pre-2020 poll.</p> <ul> <li><strong>She hinted that she would not wait until the German elections in September 2017 to trigger article 50, starting the EU withdrawal process.</strong> Number 10 has signalled that it will be triggered early next year, probably in January or February.</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>She said that the Tories wanted to build \u201ca new centre ground\u201d and that she wanted to appeal to people who had not backed the party before. </strong>She said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I think there will be many people who have not been traditional Conservative voters who will see we\u2019re the party that is actually respecting their views, listening to their concerns and responding to them.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>She said she thought government should be \u201csmall, strong and strategic\u201d. </strong>Asked her view on government intervention in the economy, she said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I\u2019m not in that position of thinking that all government is somehow bad. Government is good. But it\u2019s important that government is small, strong and strategic.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>She denied having Margaret Thatcher as a role model.</strong> She said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I haven\u2019t had a role model in my political career and I\u2019m not somebody who says, \u2018I\u2019m going to be like X\u2019. I just look at the issues that I\u2019m faced with and get on and do what I believe to be the right thing.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>She said that, unlike David Cameron, she stayed up late to do her prime ministerial paperwork. </strong>She said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I\u2019m an owl rather than a lark, so I will tend to work late. I carry on working and do the boxes that I have.</p> </blockquote> <p>Shipman says it is not unusual for May to finish working at 2am. Cameron preferred to get up at 5.45am to get through his ministerial red box.</p> <ul> <li><strong>She took a swipe at Jamie Oliver.</strong> May loves cooking, but not necessarily Oliver, Shipman suggests. He writes:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Her approach to the kitchen is as averse to gimmicks and quick fixes as her politics. I suggest that, with time tight, she might make use of Jamie Oliver\u2019s book Jamie\u2019s 15-Minute Meals. \u201cYes, 15-minute meals with 45 minutes of preparation,\u201d she said wryly, followed by a quick \u201csorry\u201d as she realises she is traducing a national treasure.</p> </blockquote> <p>Towards the end of the interview Shipman also includes this unusual, and possibly quite telling, anecdote.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It is a world that has often portrayed her as humourless but the tape of our conversation is punctuated by laughter. The transcription service sent it back with a note saying: \u201cTheresa May is a very nice woman and the transcriber thoroughly enjoyed listening to her.\u201d No one has sent such a message to me about a politician before.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57f03c29e4b015be6383332b\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-02T08:02:58.172Z\">9.02am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Tory conference policy announcements</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here are the Conservative conference policy announcements from yesterday.</p> <p>I will be updating the list as new policy announcements get made.</p> <ul> <li><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/oct/01/theresa-may-hires-former-tony-blair-policy-boss-to-review-workers-rights\">Matthew Taylor, head of the RSA thinktank and former head of the Number 10 policy unit under Tony Blair, appointed to lead an independent review of employment practices in the modern economy.</a></strong> Announcing the move, Tory HQ said: \u201cSignalling the importance she attaches to extending workers\u2019 rights - and ensuring they keep pace with these developments - the prime minister today launches an independent review of modern employment practices.</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/oct/01/dwp-scraps-retesting-for-chronically-ill-sickness-benefits-claimants\">People with the most severe health conditions who receive employment support allowance, a disability benefit, to be exempt from having to undergo regular health assessments to continue receiving payments.</a></strong></li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong><a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/government-plans-to-make-the-uk-one-of-the-most-digitally-skilled-nations\">Free training to be offered to adults who lack basic digital skills.</a></strong></li> </ul> <ul> <li><a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/220-million-for-cutting-edge-new-technology\"><strong>A \u00a3220m investment to help life science companies and universities develop viable business projects.</strong></a></li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong><a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/building-to-start-on-new-nuclear-submarines-as-government-announces-13-billion-investment\">A \u00a31.3bn investment with BAE Systems to enable construction work to begin on the generation of submarines carrying Trident nuclear missiles.</a></strong></li> </ul> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57f03aa0e4b015be63833329\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-02T07:42:02.312Z\">8.42am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Theresa May became prime minister this summer with voters having only a relatively hazy view as to what her views are. She had been home secretary for six years but she is something of a political introvert and as a cabinet minister she only gave speeches addressing matters outside her home office brief on perhaps two or three occasions. During the Conservative leadership contest she was all set to elaborate on her thinking during the final stage of the contest. But then Andrea Leadsom pulled out, with the result that only one of the series of speeches May was planning,<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/jul/11/andrea-leadsom-apologises-to-theresa-may-politics-live?page=with:block-5783a105e4b0ea445f0fe2bf#block-5783a105e4b0ea445f0fe2bf\"> the Birmingham economy speech,</a> actually got delivered.</p> <p>So that is one reason why this promises to be more interesting than the average Conservative party conference. Normally, if the party leader is prime minister, we already know quite a lot about them. This week, and particularly in her keynote speech on Wednesday, May has the chance to flesh out her politics and to present herself to the country she runs in a sharper focus.</p> <p>But there is second issue that will dominate proceedings too: Brexit. Over the summer ministers have said very little about how they will proceed with the EU withdrawal talks, beyond the vacuous and tautologicial \u201cBrexit means Brexit\u201d. This week, and particularly this afternoon, when the conference holds a session on Brexit, May and her team are going to have to say a little more. Equally importantly, conference fringe meetings on the subject are going to give members and MPs the chance to set out what their Brexit demands are.<br></p> <p>Overnight May has announced that Brexit will involve a \u201cgreat repeal\u201d bill. Here is the our story on this.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/01/theresa-may-to-propose-great-repeal-bill-to-unwind-eu-laws\">Theresa May to propose 'great repeal' bill to unwind EU laws</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And here is an extract.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>May and the Brexit secretary, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/daviddavis\">David Davis</a>, will use the opening day of the conference to detail plans for their \u201cgreat repeal\u201d bill that will allow Britain to \u201ctake back control\u201d of its legislation. The bill will repeal the 1972 European Communities Act, which gives direct effect to all EU law, and at the same time convert Brussels regulations into domestic law. </p> <p>This will give parliament the power to unpick the laws it wants to keep, remove or amend at a later date, in a move that could be welcomed by MPs who are keen to have a say over the terms of Brexit. The move is also designed to give certainty to businesses and protection for workers\u2019 rights that are enshrined in EU law.</p> <p>Davis will say: \u201cTo those who are trying to frighten British workers, saying, \u2018When we leave, employment rights will be eroded\u2019, I say firmly and unequivocally, \u2018No, they won\u2019t.\u2019\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>Here is the agenda for the day.<br></p> <p><em>9am: </em>Theresa May is interviewed on the Andrew Marr Show.

Two years after it is triggered, Britain will find itself outside the European Union, unless there is unanimous agreement among the other member states to extend the time limit.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/01/brexit-clean-quick-break-article-50-bernard-jenkin\">We need a clean and quick break from the EU | Bernard Jenkin</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Contrary to popular perceptions, article 50 inaugurates a withdrawal process, not a trade agreement. It will involve negotiating essentially technical issues, though important ones \u2013 such as the rights of British citizens in the EU and of EU citizens in the UK \u2013 and can be achieved within the two-year limit.</p> <p>Article 50 does allow for a shadow negotiation on trade matters. But, clearly, the EU cannot conclude a trade agreement with another country until that country ceases to be a member, and it is highly unlikely that a detailed trade agreement can be achieved within two years. When, in 1985, Greenland \u2013 whose population is smaller than that of Uxbridge, and whose one staple industry is fishing \u2013 withdrew, an agreement took three years to negotiate.</p> <p>In any case, EU procedures for ratifying most trade agreements are far more stringent than for ratifying a withdrawal agreement, which requires merely a qualified majority in the council and a majority in the European parliament. A trade agreement would probably require unanimity in the council, a majority in the European parliament, and also ratification in national parliaments as well as in some regional parliaments \u2013 for example, those of Flanders and Wallonia. That involves 36 legislatures, each of which has a veto.</p> <p>Matters would be easier, of course, were Britain to emulate Norway and join the European Economic Area. That, however, was established for countries proposing to join Europe, not leave it. The EEA obliges member states to incorporate not only current EU laws but also future legislation into domestic law, and to accept the principle of free movement. It also subjects member states to review by a European court \u2013 not the European Court of Justice, but the court of the European Free Trade Association \u2013 and requires a contribution to the EU budget. Per head, Norway currently pays around 83% of the British contribution.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In a more competitive and harsher world, it will be those most likely to have voted for Brexit who will suffer the most</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Since the Brexiteers wanted to end the supremacy of European law, supervision by a European court and contributions to the EU budget, this option will hardly satisfy them. It would indeed be worse than EU membership since it would involve EU regulation without representation, a kind of colonial status in which Britain would be dependent on others to look after its interests.</p> <p>Some suggest the Swiss relationship as an alternative. Switzerland has negotiated, over a period of 20 years, some 120 bilateral deals with the EU. These have to be regularly revised and renegotiated to take account of new EU laws, a cumbersome procedure. The EU dislikes this arrangement, and wants it to converge towards the Norwegian model. It is highly unlikely to replicate so broken a model for Britain.</p> <p>Remaining in the EU customs union but outside the EU is open to the obvious objection that when the EU signs a trade agreement with a third country, that third country would have access to British markets but Britain would have no access to those of the third country.</p> <p>Britain therefore may well find itself in 2019 trading under the rules of the World Trade Organisation \u2013 of which it was an original member \u2013 while still negotiating trade agreements with the EU and other countries. WTO membership, if Britain moved towards freer trade, would allow it to benefit from cheaper food from outside Europe \u2013 EU prices on beef and veal are currently around 30% higher than world prices \u2013 as well as cheaper cars, textiles and other goods subject to the EU\u2019s common external tariff.</p> <p>But the irony is that, contrary to the hopes of many Brexiteers, leaving the EU will expose Britain to more globalisation, not less; and in a more competitive and harsher world it will be the \u201cleft behind\u201d, those most likely to have voted for Brexit, who will suffer the most.</p> <p>Brexit, therefore, will be Margaret Thatcher\u2019s revenge. It will suit the vision of the Tory right, which hopes that outside the EU Britain could become like Hong Kong or Singapore, a global trading hub. These two territories have no natural resources except for their brains, which they use to the full.</p> <p>We, by contrast, have a deep-seated skills problem, first noticed by Joseph Chamberlain \u2013 the hero of Nick Timothy, Theresa May\u2019s special adviser \u2013 well over 100 years ago. The priority, if May\u2019s socially responsible capitalism is to become a reality, must be a radical skills policy. That means more resources devoted to further education colleges, currently the Cinderellas of the education service, and to university technical colleges, for those whose skills are technical and vocational rather than academic.</p> <p>In 1950 Britain was asked to engage with the continent by joining the European Coal and Steel Community, precursor of the EU. The then foreign secretary, <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/06/25/are-we-still-capable-of-governing-ourselves/\">Ernest Bevin, declined</a>, warning that once one opened that Pandora\u2019s box, all sorts of Trojan horses would fly out. Today it\u2019s clear that Brexit too will release a multitude of Trojan horses.</p>",

Jackson, who grew up in South Central Los Angeles, told TMZ the caution tape is to signify all the warnings he has seen around police scenes in his life.</p> <p>\u201cSenseless killings have been ongoing for a while, and police brutality in our black community \u2026 and as a young black leader with a stage and platform I\u2019m starting awareness to help prevent these killings and hopefully get justice to these cops who have taken lives of innocent human beings,\u201d Jackson, 29, told TMZ.</p> <p>He also said he is coming up with \u201ca master plan to start a movement.\u201d</p> <p>After coming out for warm-ups in the shoes, Jackson issued a statement through the team that struck a more conciliatory tone.</p> <p>\u201cToday is the start of my attempts to be part of a solution and start dialogue about the senseless killings of both citizens and police,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cI have chosen to wear these cleats in pre-game today to use my platform as a pro athlete to add to this discussion. This isn\u2019t meant to be any kind of protest against the good men and women in law enforcement in this country. I just want to express my concern in a peaceful and productive way about issues that are currently impacting this country.\u201d</p> <p>Several NFL teams have received pushback from police unions who resent the protests by players. Some have even threatened to pull security from NFL games though none have done so yet.</p> <p>Washington also released a statement at the same time as Jackson\u2019s, in which they backed their player while trying to not irk police.</p> <p>\u201cWe stand in support of both DeSean and the law enforcement community,\u201d the team statement said. \u201cWe have great respect for law enforcement and the sacrifices they make each and every day to protect and serve our communities. We continue to have an open dialogue with our players about issues that are important to them and support their efforts to bring awareness to those issues when done in a responsible manner.\u201d</p> <p>Jackson is one of the most prominent players to join Kaepernick in speaking out about police shootings. He also chose to make his statement through shoes than by sitting or kneeling for the national anthem, as Kaepernick and others have done. In using his shoes, Jackson is also one of the first to defy league rules by wearing apparel that makes a protest during a game.</p>",
  "<p>A new American isolationism and the transformation of Russia\u2019s global status has led to the \u201cworld order getting out of control\u201d, and \u201cunimaginable things happening\u201d, the international development minister Rory Stewart has said.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>He also suggested that, faced by a swaggering Russia, there was little that \u201cpoor old\u201d John Kerry or Barack Obama can do in Syria in the final few weeks of their White House administration. He suggested different strategic questions could be asked if Hillary Clinton were elected.</p> <p>In a frank assessment of the scale of global disorder rarely offered by a serving government minister, Stewart warned: \u201cThe world is getting out of control. You look at that whole arc of what is happening in northern Nigeria, in Mali, in Chad, what is continuing to happen in Libya, the problems that persist in Somalia, not to mention what is happening in Darfur, South Sudan, Yemen, Ukraine, in Iraq, in Syria, you are looking at a real collapse of the multilateral system at a time when the United States is increasingly doubtful about what it can do to solve it.\u201d</p> <p>Speaking at a fringe meeting organised by the thinktank Radix at the Conservative conference, Stewart added: \u201cA lot of the great driving theories that kept the American public involved have gone, of which the most important from 1946 to 1989 was the fight against communism. That was the way of really motivating the American public to invest and spend on defence. Those ideas have gone now. You cannot motivate the public in the same way.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/02/boris-johnson-russian-complicity-in-war-crimes-precludes-syria-talks\">Boris Johnson: Russian complicity in war crimes precludes Syria talks</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThat leads to a situation in which things are happening that would have been unimaginable 15 years ago \u2013 the Saudis directly intervening in Yemen without the US directly behind them.\u201d</p> <p>Stewart, a former diplomat, is one of the Conservative party\u2019s acknowledged thinkers on foreign policy, and his appointment as minister of state at international development gives him a new platform.</p> <p>Russia, he explained, \u201chas been able to transform its global status in the past three years\u201d, requiring a complete rethink of how the UN operates, and new ways of strengthening multilateral institutions.</p> <p>He said: \u201cRussia has succeeded within the past few years in completely transforming its global position at a time when you thought it would be at its weakest. Its economy is struggling, it is not getting the incomes it would have expected and yet it behaves like a much bigger country than Britain.</p> <p>\u201cIt swaggers its way around. The way it is currently operating in the Ukraine, the way it is threatening in the Baltic states and in Syria would be almost unimaginable a few years ago. What Russia is demonstrating is that they are able, like Iran, to do very, very strange things.\u201d</p> <p>He also admitted that Syria\u2019s president, Bashar al-Assad, had been saved by Russian military intervention. \u201cAssad was in very real problems two years ago. The likelihood is that he would have lost Aleppo, most of the south and probably Homs as well if Russia had not intervened. Russia has been decisive in that intervention.\u201d</p> <p>He added that the west was in a double bind. He said: \u201cAssad has done genuinely terrible things and it is almost unimaginable that there will be peace in Syria so long as that guy is around, partly because it is in his interests to keep disorder. It is in his interests for terrorists to be there because terrorists are his legitimating principle. It is the way he gets support; to say there are terrorists out there.\u201d</p> <p>He went on: \u201cOn the other hand, what are the options facing President Obama? Setting aside the fact there are only nine weeks to go for this administration \u2026 it is pretty difficult for poor old Kerry and Obama to make a strong decisive act at the moment.</p> <p>\u201cThe model of successfully taking on a Russian-backed central government from the point of view of an opposition was only pulled off by the US once and that was in Afghanistan in 1981-89. But \u2013 there is a big but \u2013 because the success of the opposition to Russia led to the catastrophe of Afghanistan from 1991-2000, you end up funding, if you are not careful, opposition groups that are much more radical than you want them to be and actually when the government collapses it leads to a civil war and the situation comes become worse on the ground.\u201d</p> <p>He said the task was to bring some structure of global order and security back into place, partly by investing in the idea of the United Nations. But, he added: \u201cMy God, that organisation needs reform. We have to be aware that aspects of the UN, some people will remind them in some ways of the issues we had around Brexit \u2013 supranational government, bureaucracies, the way that money is spent, what does this organisation actually do?\u201d</p> <p>He argued that, before greater military intervention could be considered by the UK or the US in Syria, fundamental questions needed to be asked about the role of regional partners, such as Saudi Arabia, the role of the Kurds, the balance of military advantage inside Syria and the future of Mosul, Iraq\u2019s second largest city, which is due to be attacked by the west in the next few weeks.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p>",

Sure, there have been the accusations of excessive thriftiness and blind faith in youth, but when I watch Arsenal I don\u2019t see any tactical innovation or flexibility. Instead, Wenger\u2019s gameplan seems to amount to little more than sending a group of technically-gifted players out onto the pitch with a vague instruction to pass the ball, and hoping that brilliance will naturally occur. I love the man for his great teams, and he was an innovator in his prime; now, though, Arsene seems to have been left in the shade by the relentless tactical evolution of Guardiola and his cohort of bright, youthful upstarts.\u201d</p> <p>It does seem odd that for all Arsenal\u2019s good form, it takes just a couple of injuries to make them look one dimensional. It\u2019s a good dimension, mind, but they still need some more diversity in the way that they can play.

  "<p>Financial markets are preparing for an uncertain final quarter of the year as traders fret about Theresa May\u2019s more concrete Brexit timetable, the health of European banks and the US presidential elections.</p> <p>The British prime minister suggested on Sunday that the country\u2019s exit from the EU would <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/02/brexit-theresa-may-prioritises-immigration-curbs-over-free-movement\">lean towards a \u201chard Brexit\u201d</a>, as she implied regaining control of immigration was more important than access to the single market. May earlier announced that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/01/theresa-may-to-propose-great-repeal-bill-to-unwind-eu-laws\">article 50 \u2013 the legal device to begin the process of departure \u2013 would be triggered by the end of March</a>.</p> <p>Some traders fear the prime minister\u2019s moves might lead to a swift fall in the value of pound, mirroring the markets\u2019 reaction immediately after the UK voted to leave the EU on June 23, when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jun/23/british-pound-given-boost-by-projected-remain-win-in-eu-referendum\">sterling slumped to a 31-year low</a>.</p> <p>One trader said that financial markets had not taken account of a \u201ctimetabled hard Brexit\u201d when markets closed on Friday evening, meaning the pound could \u201cgap lower\u201d on Monday.</p> <p>However, others argued that the triggering of article 50 in early 2017 was expected, but the debate about what that move would mean would create uncertainty. <br></p> <p>Joshua Raymond, a director at financial trading firm XTB, said he expected volatility in the value of the pound, with both sides of the Brexit argument using the media to sway public opinion to their side of the argument. He believes that the government had hedged its bets by also implying a soft Brexit.<br></p> <p>He said that the prime minister\u2019s indication that the UK would enact article 50 before the end of March could actually be supportive of the pound in the very short term \u201cbecause of the certainty it provides investors and businesses that the roadmap to Brexit has begun\u201d.</p> <p>He added: \u201cHowever, the main support could come from recent comments from both the prime minister and chancellor, who spoke out against the idea of a hard Brexit to end freedom of movement. That leaves the door open for positive conversations about remaining in the single market, which is the markets key area of concern\u201d.</p> <p>The wavering over what Brexit eventually means comes as traders also try to take stock of how prices might be affected by a host of geopolitical issues, such as the increasingly bitter US presidential election.</p> <p>Alastair Winter, the chief economist at the investment bank Daniel Stewart, wrote in a research note on Sunday: \u201cBarclays Bank\u2019s latest survey shows geopolitical developments to have become the biggest concern to investors. Moreover, concern over the developed market economies (i.e. democracies) continues to overshadow those over China and other emerging markets. This suggests rising fears that the \u2018sans culottes\u2019 with their pitchforks will yet storm the great citadels of the west.</p> <p>\u201cIn summary, the political fundamentals are bad enough but may not get much worse soon. Of course ... the economic fundamentals also look grim.\u201d</p> <p>The UK\u2019s FTSE 100 rose by 6% in the July-September quarter, its best performance since 2013, as the weaker pound pushed up the value of internationally focused blue-chip companies. Sterling, though, fell against the US dollar for the fifth quarter running \u2013 the worst run since 1984.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/02/article-50-timescale-theresa-may-brexit\">What will happen now timescale for article 50 has been revealed?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>James Stanley, a currency analyst at foreign exchange group DailyFX, also believes the fourth quarter will be challenging.</p> <p>\u201cThere are some very pertinent themes for markets as we enter the final quarter of 2016,\u201d he said, referring the US election and concerns about the health of European banks following last week\u2019s gyrations in the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/deutschebank\">Deutsche Bank</a> share price. The Deutsche sell-off followed reports that <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/29/commerzbank-job-cuts-restructuring\">hedge funds were pulling assets from the bank amid suggestions that Berlin may be forced into a bailout</a>.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Deutsche Bank\u2019s plight has prompted fears that global markets are facing turmoil of the kind triggered by the collapse of Lehman Brothers eight years ago this month. </p> <p>Stanley said: \u201cThe big worry here isn\u2019t just one bank getting hit. The bigger concern is a contagion effect; because banks trade with each other and if one major bank gets taken out, this can create a nasty cascade effect across markets as other banks get pinched by counterparty risk. </p> <p>\u201cSo going into Q4 this is the top theme for markets to watch because, frankly, it can have the most firepower. It\u2019s also going to be one of the most difficult to time and follow, as this is basically a liquid situation that will continue to morph and develop as there isn\u2019t a template-response for the European Central Bank to handle such situations.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>British farmers growing wheat typically <a href=\"https://secure.fera.defra.gov.uk/pusstats/surveys/documents/arable2014v2.pdf\">treat each crop</a> over its growing cycle with four fungicides, three herbicides, one insecticide and one chemical to control molluscs. They buy seed that has been precoated with chemicals against insects. They spray the land with weedkiller before planting, and again after.</p> <p>They apply chemical growth regulators that change the balance of plant hormones to control the height and strength of the grain\u2019s stem. They spray against aphids and mildew. And then they often spray again just before harvesting with the herbicide glyphosate to desiccate the crop, which saves them the energy costs of mechanical drying.</p> <p>Most farmers around the world, whatever the crop, will turn to one of just six companies that dominate the market to buy all these agrochemicals and their seeds. The concentration of power over primary agriculture in such a small number of corporations, and their ability both to set prices and determine the varieties available, has already been a cause of concern among farmers. Yet by next year the competition is likely to shrink even further.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/14/bayer-takeover-monsanto-66-billion-deal\">Bayer's $66bn takeover bid of Monsanto called a 'marriage made in hell'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The six global chemical and seed giants will become three behemoths with even greater market control. Just when climate change demands a more diverse and adaptable food system, resilient to changing conditions, agriculture is being dragged further down an ever-narrowing agroindustrial route.</p> <p>Bayer, Monsanto, Dupont, Dow, Syngenta and BASF currently account for three-quarters of the global agrochemical market and nearly two-thirds of the commercial seed market. As commodity prices have fallen, their profits have been flagging. Farmers who are getting less for their crops have struggled to make money. In the US they have begun turning away from expensive GM seed, and in Europe more than 3m farms have been lost in eight years. So for two years the agrochemical companies have been engaged in a flurry of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/may/05/monsanto-dow-syngenta-rush-for-mega-mergers-puts-food-security-at-risk\">merger and acquisition activity</a> to become even bigger and more powerful. The bids have settled, for the moment, on a trio of megadeals.</p> <p>The most recently agreed<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/14/bayer-takeover-monsanto-66-billion-deal\"> merger, worth $66bn</a>, is between Monsanto, the controversial US-headquartered giant that is the world\u2019s largest seed and seventh-largest pesticide company, and German-based Bayer, the world\u2019s second-largest agrochemical and seventh-largest seed company.</p> <p>To give a sense of the scale of this deal and its impact, Monsanto, as well as being the leading global supplier of genetically modified seed, controls nearly a quarter of the vegetable seed market in Europe and is a big player in conventional maize seed. The herbicide glyphosate, its big earner, is now so commonly used across Europe that <a href=\"http://www.foeeurope.org//glyphosate-reasons-for-concern-briefing-130613\">it has been detected</a> in the urine of 44% of people surveyed for Friends of the Earth. Bayer is a leader in most pesticides, including neonicotinoids used to treat about 90% of UK cereal, sugar beet and oil seed rape.</p> <p>The proposed Bayer-Monsanto merger follows a $130bn deal between the US corporates DuPont (No 2 in seeds, 6 in pesticides) and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/11/dow-chemical-dupont-merger-dowdupont\">Dow Chemical company</a> (5 in seeds, 4 in pesticides). China, focused on its own food security, wants a bit of the action too, and its state-backed agrochemical company <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/feb/03/chemchina-makes-43bn-dollar-offer-for-swiss-pesticide-firm-syngenta\">ChemChina</a> (seventh in global pesticide sales via subsidiaries) has successfully bid $43bn for Swiss Syngenta. A parallel process of concentration is taking place in the fertiliser sector.</p> <p>The narrative offered to justify this dominance of a supposedly free market is that only bigger, braver new entities can rise to the great challenge of our time: how to feed <a href=\"https://www.advancingtogether.com/en/about-the-combination/compelling-strategic-rationale/\">an additional 3 billion people</a> by 2050 without destroying the planet. We are asked to accept the intensive model of agriculture as the heroic march of science, against primitive, low-yielding, traditional methods of production. There is no alternative. But in fact it is this model of food production that is stuck in a rut.</p> <p>Postwar, there were indeed huge strides in increasing the amount of food produced globally thanks to plant breeding and the use of chemicals in the form of artificial fertilisers and pesticides. But alongside the triumphs of that green revolution, its longer-term shortcomings are increasingly apparent.</p> <p>Overuse of agrochemicals has contributed to steep losses in biodiversity, and crucially of pollinators vital to food. Increases in pest resistance threaten to reverse previous gains in yields. <a href=\"http://www.ipes-food.org/reports\">Research</a> has found that over a short period yields per hectare for individual crops are greater in intense agricultural systems. But over a longer period, and when you look at total farm output, more mixed and diverse farming produces more.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/sep/16/pakistan-fights-devastating-malnutrition-with-mass-food-fortifying-programme\">Pakistan fights devastating malnutrition with mass food-fortifying programme</a> </p> </aside>  <p>If the prime purpose of a food system is to nourish people and keep them healthy, this one is failing. Despite a doubling of available food in some regions, more than 750 million people still routinely go hungry. At the same time nearly 2 billion are overweight or obese.</p> <p>The agroindustrial system these companies underpin is primarily focused on a small number of commodity crops for export. The <a href=\"http://www.etcgroup.org/recent-reports\">ETC</a> research group points out that GM seed companies have concentrated their development efforts on maize, soya and rapeseed (canola) rather than a wide range of the 7,000-odd food crops grown by farmers around the world. Breaking these commodity crops down into their constituent parts and reselling them as sugars, starches, and fats adds shareholder value in the chain but depletes nutritional value. <a href=\"http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs355/en/\">Diet-related diseases</a> have now overtaken infectious diseases as the largest cause of premature death globally.</p> <p>Although the companies talk of tackling the threat that climate change poses to food security, the agroindustrial food system is one of the most significant causes of it, contributing a third of all manmade <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/news/one-third-of-our-greenhouse-gas-emissions-come-from-agriculture-1.11708\">greenhouse gas emissions</a>.</p> <p>Corporate concentration in the food system has sucked the money to be made in the chain up to a handful of companies at the top. It works for the few but not for the many. As if to underline the point, the chief executive of Monsanto stands to collect over $135m from the Bayer merger in share options and severance pay. But paradoxically, these three mergers to increase power reveal a sector that is also vulnerable. The pesticide business is under pressure \u2013 Bayer and Syngenta are both big producers of the three types of neonicotinoids recently banned in the EU because of their <a href=\"http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2013:139:0012:0026:EN:PDF\">impact on bees</a>. The EU has been under pressure too to restrict the use of <a href=\"http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-16-2012_en.htm\">glyphosate</a>, since it was ruled a \u201c<a href=\"http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanonc/article/PIIS1470-2045%2815%2970134-8/abstract\">probable carcinogen</a>\u201d by the WHO last year.</p> <p>This way of producing our food is broken and most people, including those still promoting it, know it. So why does it not change? The former UN rapporteur on the right to food, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/olivier-de-schutter\">Olivier de Schutter</a>, has described a series of \u201clock-ins\u201d that prevent change. Because value accrues to a limited number of actors, their political and economic power and ability to influence government policy is reinforced.</p> <p>The latest frontier is Africa, where there is a new scramble to spread the agroindustrial model of farming. It may well be in Africa, however, that a different, more ecological vision of the food future emerges. I had a glimmer of it on a trip to a large-scale horticultural export company based on Kenya\u2019s Lake Naivasha.</p> <p>The company, Flamingo Homegrown, has abandoned its long and heavy use of chemical pesticides, partly in response to a campaign highlighting their effect on workers\u2019 health, but partly too in recognition that they were on a losing treadmill of spraying and pest resistance.</p> <p>They have reinvented their agriculture in a way that makes the science of agrochemical use look as primitive as a blunderbuss. Instead they employ groups of highly trained African scientists to study and reproduce in labs the fungi and microrrhizae in healthy soil that form intricate links with plant roots. Rather than waging chemical war on the land, they are working to harness its immensely complex ecosystems. They have built vast greenhouses dedicated to breeding and harvesting ladybirds to control pests biologically rather than chemically.</p> <p>There is an another route to food security \u2013 and it is the polar opposite of three agrochemical giants bestriding the world.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 3 October 2016.

  "<p>Theresa May has given her strongest indication yet that the UK\u2019s exit from the EU will lean towards a \u201chard Brexit\u201d, suggesting that regaining control of immigration was more important than access to the single market.</p> <p>Addressing the Conservative party conference in Birmingham, the prime minister also promised that all EU workers\u2019 rights would remain protected for as long as she was in power.</p> <p>Controlling immigration would be the key basis for departure, May said. The government would seek access to the EU\u2019s single market if possible, she said, adding: \u201cBut let me be clear.

  "<p>Leicester City remain unbeaten at home in the league for more than a year but Claudio Ranieri admitted Southampton should have ended that record here.

Three minutes later the striker nodded wide from a cross by Dusan Tadic. Austin went much closer in the 15th minute, running on to a delightful chip by Steven Davis before firing a shot past Schmeichel from an acute angle. To the striker\u2019s despair the ball bounced out off the far post.</p> <p>Leicester, outnumbered and outmuscled in central midfield, were reliant on Riyad Mahrez for creativity but despite a couple of teasing runs,the Algerian was unable to help make a breakthrough. Instead Virgil van Dijk became an unwitting assistant, the normally infallible Dutchman teeing up Jamie Vardy by leaving a back pass short in the 29th minute. Oriol Romeu rescued the visitors by making a remarkable triple block, first foiling Vardy after Fraser Forster forced the striker wide, then stopping Islam Slimani\u2019s follow-up shot before getting in the way of a second attempt by Vardy.</p> <p>Romeu, with Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg, was running midfield in a way that may have had the home fans reminiscing about N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9 but he almost sullied his brilliance by playing a slack pass to Slimani. This time Jos\u00e9 Fonte came to the rescue.</p> <p>Southampton remained the more inventive in the second half. Davis had a shot from 18 yards deflected over by Daniel Amartey on the hour. Two minutes later the Northern Irishman slipped a ball through to Nathan Redmond, who confirmed that finishing is an art that he has yet to master by shooting weakly at Schmeichel.</p> <p>Austin, by contrast, is normally an expert finisher but here he erred. Davis made a chance for him to open the scoring in the 66th minute but, after shrugging off Christian Fuchs, Austin did not get the right weight on an attempted lob, which Schmeichel saved well after dashing off the line.</p> <p>It was not one-way traffic, even though Southampton were making most of the chances. Danny Drinkwater gave a reminder the home side were still well in the game by stinging Forster\u2019s hands with a drive from 25 yards.</p> <p>Ranieri replaced his front players towards the end. Shinji Okazaki, introduced instead of Vardy, made his presence felt immediately, heading just wide.</p> <p>Southampton\u2019s substitutes should have made an even bigger impact. Two of them, Shane Long and James Ward-Prowse, undid the home defence in the 83rd minute, only for Ward-Prowse to waft a shot over from 14 yards.</p>",

If that was the case, Bill Clinton would still be in office,\u201d she joked.</p> <p>Michelle often debates politics with her sister, Terry, 57, who will be voting for Clinton. Terry laughed, not unkindly, when she heard her sister talk about Trump\u2019s comments. \u201cAre you sure you don\u2019t know who you\u2019re voting for?\u201d she said.</p> <h2>Anchorage, Alaska: \u2018He needs to control his mouth\u2019</h2> <p>At Hi-Rollers Hair Salon in Anchorage, Amie Haakenson, 45, was waiting for her color to set. She\u2019s a registered Republican planning on voting for Trump. His comments about weight weren\u2019t wise, she said, but there are larger issues in the election to consider. </p> <p>\u201cI am an overweight, middle-aged woman. I could really care less about the (weight) comment,\u201d she said. She was more bothered by the fact Trump didn\u2019t seem to be reining in inappropriate comments as she\u2019d hoped he would as he became a more seasoned candidate. \u201cHe needs to control his mouth, that\u2019s what he needs to do,\u201d she said. \u201cTo be quite honest, I say things that are inappropriate sometimes too, like everyone else, but I try not to let them come out when I am the face of an organization, much less the face of the free world.\u201d <br><br>A presidency isn\u2019t just about one person, it\u2019s about the group of people that they bring with them, she said. </p> <p>On the campus of University of Alaska in Fairbanks, social work professor Kim Swisher, 43, a life-long moderate Republican, said she believes strongly in second amendment rights and noted that her mother campaigned for Nixon. But Trump\u2019s weight comments pushed her over the edge. </p> <p>\u201cThe weight thing concerns me,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m a professional woman, and I\u2019m a size 16. What his comments have done for me, they have affirmed that due to my size, I would be invalid in a world where Trump leads.\u201d</p> <p>She was particularly disappointed in the Republican party for not offering voters a better choice. \u201cThis is not the Republican party I have voted for in the past,\u201d she said. </p> <p>Peggy Treadway, 30, works at an employment agency in Anchorage. In the office on Friday, she described herself as an outdoorsy woman who fishes in the summer and rides snow mobiles in the winter. </p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve always voted Republican, always, but this year I don\u2019t really know,\u201d she said. Trump should never have brought up a woman\u2019s weight, she said. \u201cHonestly, it just adds to the pile of stones that makes me not really like him as much. It\u2019s another strike against him. I don\u2019t how many strikes it will take before I say enough is enough. I don\u2019t really like the alternative, though.\u201d</p> <p>Outside the Safeway grocery store in Wasilla on Friday, Lisa Smith, 43, an independent voter and mother of four foster children, said she\u2019d gained weight due to a medication she was taking after spending many years as a size four. And for that reason, Trump\u2019s comments felt especially cruel. </p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m considered obese. What is it, Miss Piggy, he called one of those contestants?\u201d she said. Women and girls whose bodies don\u2019t fit Trump\u2019s standards have a hard enough time. \u201cTo hear somebody called that, it makes our self-esteem even worse,\u201d she said. </p>",
  "<p>After 40 hotel-bound hours \u2013 save for a game of golf on an adjoining course \u2013since arriving in Bangladesh, England\u2019s cricketers experienced their first full armed convoy when travelling to the Sher-e-Bangla stadium in Dhaka for their first training session before the one-day international series begins on Friday.</p> <p>The five England and Wales Cricket Board vehicles were lined by armed motorbikes and 4x4s. The task force included government troops, special forces, intelligence agencies and scores of police at ground level, with rooftop gunmen in attendance. Roads were closed for the majority of the 15-minute journey (normally it would take four times as long), but on the approach to the ground many fans \u2013 cordoned off by police \u2013 lined the streets for a glimpse of the team bus.</p> <p>As many as 500 people were involved in the security effort, which was funded by the Bangladeshi government; they worked in conjunction with the Bangladesh Cricket Board and the ECB\u2019s security adviser, Reg Dickason, whose visit last month <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/12/england-players-skip-bangladesh-tour-terror-fears\" title=\"\">declared Bangladesh safe to tour</a>. Such a convoy will join the team \u2013 who have the director of cricket, Andrew Strauss, and the chief executive, Tom Harrison, for company \u2013 each time they travel to and from the ground.</p> <p>Upon arrival the players seemed at ease as they were whisked into the stadium. Jos Buttler, the captain in the absence of Eoin Morgan, faced close to 100 local journalists, who echoed the public\u2019s sentiment of goodwill that the tour is taking place. \u201cTouring the subcontinent, security is paramount,\u201d said Buttler. \u201cWe are looked after very well. That is part and parcel of making the tour OK. Now we are here we will focus on cricket. Those things will go back into the background.\u201d</p> <p>After Buttler spoke, England trained. First at the nets behind the ground \u2013 overlooked by Dhaka high-rises (with armed gunmen on top) \u2013 before doing fielding practice under lights on the ground (preceded, of course, by the obligatory game of football). All three ODIs \u2013 the first two are here, with the third in Chittagong \u2013 are day-night matches.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"46ddd1093b64b0b47fa689fc50246533491d33eb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/46ddd1093b64b0b47fa689fc50246533491d33eb/93_28_5258_3157/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Armed police guard the England team bus at Sher-e-Bangla stadium in Dhaka.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Armed police guard the England team bus at Sher-e-Bangla stadium in Dhaka.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gareth Copley/Getty Images,</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Earlier the assistant coach, Paul Farbrace, said he was \u201cmassively disappointed\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/11/andrew-strauss-disappointed-eoin-morgan-alex-hales-bangladesh\" title=\"\">with the withdrawal of Alex Hales and the regular white-ball captain Morgan</a>, who pulled out because of security concerns, although he believes their absence presents an opportunity to some fringe players. That said, Farbrace was unequivocal in his belief that Morgan should captain the ODI side on their next tour, to India in January.</p> <p>The identity of those who will replace Hales and Morgan, and Joe Root, who has been rested for this leg of the tour, should become clearer on Tuesday when England face a BCB XI at Fatullah. James Vince, Ben Duckett, Jonny Bairstow and Sam Billings are competing to replace the trio, although Farbrace did not rule out Moeen Ali returning to the top of the order. Farbrace said Buttler would keep wicket.</p> <p>\u201cI was massively disappointed that the two of them chose not to go,\u201d Farbrace said. \u201cBut you get over that disappointment and you realise that there are opportunities for others to get a go. If we are going to be challengers in 2019 our pool of players needs to keep expanding. I feel we have 20-21 guys who could play for England and we wouldn\u2019t have necessarily a weaker side.</p> <p>\u201cThe ideal is that the guys coming in do brilliantly, so Alex and Morgs know that getting their place back will be very tough. That\u2019s the only risk that the pair run, that the guys come in, do brilliantly, then in India obviously selection will be very tough.\u201d</p> <p>Farbrace \u2013 who like the head coach, Trevor Bayliss, who arrives from Sydney on Sunday night after visa trouble, was aboard the Sri Lankan team bus that was shot at in Pakistan in 2009 \u2013 seemed unperturbed by the security arrangements. \u201cAround the hotel it\u2019s not too in your face, like Pakistan where there are guards sat outside your door with guns. First thing you see in the morning is a pair of boots and the butt of a gun. It\u2019s not like that here and I don\u2019t think we could be in a better place really.\u201d</p> <p>Like Buttler, the management hope that after the first training session the focus will shift from security to cricket, and Farbrace was quick to warn that England will face a stern foe here. On Saturday Bangladesh completed their sixth straight ODI series win at home, a run that includes victories over South Africa, India and Pakistan, while they <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/mar/09/england-crash-out-cricket-world-cup-bangladesh\" title=\"\">knocked England out of the 2015 World Cup in Adelaide</a>.</p> <p>\u201cThis is a tough place to come, which it didn\u2019t used to be apart from the conditions,\u201d he said. \u201cI think a few of our lads will be quite surprised by the standard they are up against \u2013 not just the tough conditions, but the quality of the opposition. They might not admit it, but I think they will be surprised.\u201d</p>",

His obligation is to make money for his enterprises and save money for his enterprises. It would be insane for him not to take advantage.\u201d</p> <p>Speaking in support of Clinton, Sanders told ABC: \u201cIf everyone in this country was a genius like Mr Trump and did not pay taxes, we would not have a country.</p> <p>\u201cThis is exactly why so many millions of Americans are frustrated,\u201d he added to CNN. \u201cThey are angry, they are disgusted at what they see as a corrupt political system in this country.\u201d</p> <p>Trump has<a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/640281925270286336?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\"> a long history of criticizing people who do not pay taxes</a>, such as tweet from September 2015 in which he said: \u201cThe hedge fund guys (gals) have to pay higher taxes ASAP.

Gibson is busy protecting his wayward daughter from gangsters she\u2019s been associating with; there is, as one expects from a Gibson project, a good deal of bloodletting.<br></p> <p>Gibson looks terrifying, I say, pumped up and fully bearded, like he\u2019s just stepped out of a wild west wanted poster. \u201cI had a start when I first saw him,\u201d Macy says, with widening eyes. \u201cHe\u2019s built like a tank \u2013 he\u2019s in such great shape, his eyes, arms all buffed like \u2026 he\u2019s Mel Gibson, man! He\u2019s the best Mel Gibson I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d He laughs. \u201cAnd by a lot! Nobody does it better!\u201d</p> <p>Blood Father is a good, old-fashioned drive-in thriller and Gibson is amazing in it, raw, furious, burning with anger and vengeance. But he still manages to leave room for scene-stealer Macy, who has the kind of role that actors working in long-running TV dramas find they have to fight for during their down time. Macy has expressed disdain for serial character work in films: the chasing (though he has to do less of that these days) and just the sheer hassle of standing around miles from home, waiting an eternity for new camera set-ups and then delivering a few seconds of actual acting.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>TV has been such a blessing.

I\u2019m gonna need a long lie down after shooting all of this. It\u2019s not nothing, shooting a lot of TV in a very short time, and Shameless has lots of drama, farce and energy. But really, TV has been such a blessing for me. The aforementioned staying at home. I\u2019m pretty sure my family are happy to have me home.\u201d He chuckles. \u201cUh, pretty sure.\u201d</p> <p>He would even go as far as to say TV has been his salvation, especially at his age. Now 66, he\u2019s been on Shameless since he was 58, and loves being able to drive his teenage kids to school every day. The uprooting process of heading to movie locations in different states, or even continents, is largely a thing of the past. He\u2019s been married to fellow actor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2006/mar/11/features.weekend\">Felicity Huffman</a> since 1997 and, every morning as he heads off to Shameless, she\u2019s getting ready for her own TV show, American Crime, now shooting its third season (before that it was Desperate Housewives).

He\u2019s entrepreneurial, he\u2019s living his passion. His raison d\u2019\u00eatre is to <em>not</em> work. It hasn\u2019t been easy over the years, but he\u2019s learned, and he has never worked.\u201d A slightly menacing tone, straight from one of Frank\u2019s crueller hangovers, has emerged. \u201cI fuckin\u2019 love him.

And give Trump his due: when he talks, he does, unlike most politicians, reveal some of himself. I mean, there\u2019s not much thought behind what he says \u2013 and it\u2019s horrifying what he\u2019s revealing \u2013 but I pray this changes the bar for conventional politicians, because nothing annoys me more than obfuscating speech and not answering a question, not copping to it honestly. Maybe that\u2019ll be different.\u201d</p> <p>Since Trump seems to wish upon us a return to some kind of an imaginary paradise from the past, I ask Macy, as we part, which era he would go back to. \u201cI think 1971,\u201d he says, and I expect him to mention his old <a href=\"https://atlantictheater.org/explore-2/ensemble/william-h-macy/\">theatre days</a> with the likes of David Mamet and Joe Mantegna.

Neighbourhoods such as Braamfontein and Maboneng are now seen as hubs of creativity and cool.</p> <p>But the change, though real, is limited \u2013 and exactly how widely its benefits will be shared is not yet clear.</p> <p> \u201cRegeneration has to be for everyone \u2026 I have no problem with land for luxury apartments, as long as there is commensurate land for the poor,\u201d says Stuart Wilson, of the local NGO <a href=\"http://www.seri-sa.org/\">Socio-Economic Rights Institute of South Africa</a>.</p> <p>Many have dated the decline of the 18 sq km inner city of Johannesburg to the country\u2019s first democratic elections in 1994, which saw the African National Congress (ANC) take power.</p> <p> But this is unfair, says Gerald Garner, a local historian and guide. Racist measures adopted by the apartheid regime from the 1950s gradually forced industries out of Johannesburg\u2019s centre in search of labour. Then international sanctions led to the exodus of global companies and their staff in the mid 1980s. </p> <p> The cumulative effect was devastating, according to Garner. Apartment blocks and homes emptied, the doors of multi-storey offices were locked, luxury hotels closed. Basic utilities were disconnected.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ebf2692bf74a04b2f1a82a1c6ea0658945c4ed55\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ebf2692bf74a04b2f1a82a1c6ea0658945c4ed55/0_300_4500_2700/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Jay Jay\u2019 makes traditional beer to sell from his room inside 54 Soper Road.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Jay Jay\u2019 makes traditional beer to sell from his room inside 54 Soper Road.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: James Oatway/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When racist laws restricting movement were reluctantly eased by the beleaguered apartheid regime, tens of thousands of poor migrants rushed to the city. Others came, and still come, from elsewhere in Africa. About 1,000 vacant buildings became vast squats, often run by violent gangs. The centre became an internationally infamous no-go zone. </p> <p>Fitful regeneration efforts began around 15 years ago with major public projects funded by the ANC-run town hall, central government and overseas aid. Momentum gathered as South Africa prepared to host the 2010 World Cup, and private developers began buying up the \u201chijacked\u201d buildings, evicting squatters and constructing apartments. </p> <p>Sometimes this occurred peacefully, but in the past the process of emptying occupied buildings has, on occasion, involved significant violence. This was directed both at South African citizens, some of them long-term residents, and the large numbers of migrants who continued to flow in from poorer, less stable neighbouring countries and beyond. </p> <p>Now only 100 or so illegally occupied buildings remain, though these still provide accommodation for about 60,000 people.</p> <p>The residents of 54 Soper Road, in the tough neighbourhood of Berea, are among them. Berea has proved resistant to regeneration. There are many illegally occupied buildings and few of the signs of economic growth seen elsewhere.

  "<p>Manchester United will <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2016/oct/02/manchester-united-v-stoke-city-premier-league-live\" title=\"\">rue their inability to kill off Stoke City</a> on a day when Anthony Martial\u2019s strike was their solitary yield from a glut of chances created.</p> <p>The Frenchman appeared to have secured an invaluable win after a double Jos\u00e9 Mourinho substitution that led directly to his opener.</p> <p>Sixty-seven minutes had gone when Juan Mata and Jesse Lingard came off for Wayne Rooney and Martial. Two more were played before the No11 gave United the lead and this initiated a flurry of opportunities. But they failed to score and up popped Joe Allen for the equaliser which came after David de Gea fluffed Glen Johnson\u2019s shot. Jonathan Walters turned the ball on to the bar and the Welshman made no mistake.</p> <p>Mourinho acted instantly, throwing on Memphis Depay for Ander Herrera and United went close in a frantic finish that had Pogba thumping the bar with an effort that came off his shoulder but Stoke clung on.</p> <p>Mourinho claimed that Mark Hughes\u2019s team should have suffered a hiding. \u201cWe should be not just with the three points but a fat result. It should have been 3-0 or 4-0 at half-time, six or seven at the end. But the result is 1-1. Very undeserved but a much <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/24/manchester-united-leicester-city-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">better performance than against Leicester</a>,\u201d he said of the 4-1 win last week.</p> <p>Asked about the profligacy, the Portuguese said: \u201cI never criticise my players for missing chances. The goalkeeper is the man of the match and deservedly. We had some open chances where we could [do] better but I am never critical of my players. I can be critical of the no quality of the performance, the naive mistakes sometimes but not in front of the goal.\u201d</p> <p>He would admit vexation at the result. \u201cWhen the result should be 5-0 or 6-0 and it is 1-0 then happiness disappears and the frustration with the result comes. I think this was our best performance in the football we played \u2013 the creation, chances, the consistency because we did that for 90 minutes. We start in the first minute with a big chance and we finish in the last minute with another one and in between we had four, five, six, seven.</p> <p>\u201cWe had complete control of the game, a great attitude after the 1-0. We kept creating chances and then by magic they crossed the midfield line and scored a goal which is very unfair for us.\u201d</p> <p>Within seconds of kick-off Zlatan Ibrahimovic was the first to spurn a simple chance. Pogba dribbled, put the Swede through, Lee Grant\u2019s goal gaped and all the No9 required was the kind of finish that has built his reputation. Instead he allowed the save and from the corner Stoke cleared.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dbdb70d584353ab3518cb0ffb8c1a2d435dfb21d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dbdb70d584353ab3518cb0ffb8c1a2d435dfb21d/8_0_1885_1131/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Joe Allen pokes the ball past Antonio Valencia for Stoke\u2019s equaliser.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Joe Allen pokes the ball past Antonio Valencia for Stoke\u2019s equaliser.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Carl Recine/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Later, a slick Potters sequence splayed United but Geoff Cameron was unable to score. Xherdan Shaqiri\u2019s back-heel released Allen who pinged the ball towards Wilfried Bony. It came to Cameron but the shot was regulation for De Gea.</p> <p>Now United did better via a four-man play. Antonio Valencia passed to Mata who recycled to Ibrahimovic and his flick found Lingard. The winger delivered to Pogba but he missed the target.</p> <p>Mata was again playing at No10 in place of Rooney and showing why. From what seemed a blind alley the Spaniard created an opening and came close to chipping Grant. The keeper tipped the ball over and when Daley Blind\u2019s subsequent corner dropped on Pogba\u2019s head, he should have scored.</p> <p>It was the contest in microcosm for United. They dominated, they created, they could not capitalise. Two further examples involved Ibrahimovic and Lingard. Chance A came from a run and cross from the Swede from which Lingard forced a Grant save. Chance&#xa0;B was a reversal in which Lingard ran along the right and put the ball in for Ibrahimovic, but he could not score.</p> <p>More of the same followed in the second half. Ibrahimovic cut through the middle but the move broke down. Lingard skated along his flank and crossed and Pogba\u2019s effort went for a corner.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2016/oct/02/manchester-united-v-stoke-city-premier-league-live\">Manchester United 1-1 Stoke City: Premier League \u2013 as it happened</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The endeavour had Mourinho clapping but he now saw his side slashed open by Stoke. The ball went Shaqiri-Marko Arnautovic-Allen in a triangle that left the Welshman behind United\u2019s lines with only De Gea to beat. The shot was yet another simple one to collect.</p> <p>Herrera was fortunate to be only booked for a studs-high tackle above Allen\u2019s knee. The Stoke player said: \u201cSometimes they get sent, off sometimes they don\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>After a stodgy phase of play Mourinho made his move and on came Rooney and Martial. It worked instantly. Martial zipped along his corridor and turned the ball into Rooney. He dawdled and while this allowed Cameron to dispossess him the ball was stabbed back to Martial who banged his shot past Grant for the opener, which was also his first goal of the season.</p> <p>This prompted United\u2019s late onslaught as Rooney just missed a cross, Blind had an attempt blocked and Ibrahimovic a shot saved. Now, though, came a Stoke fightback that left Hughes contented.</p> <p>\u201cWe showed we are a good side at this level,\u201d he said, though they are still one off the bottom.</p>",

He made two world-class stops to deny Ibrahimovic, then Lingard, as well as a handful of others to keep his side in the game. </p> <p>They proved to be crucial, as the game\u2019s other keeper, David de Gea, gifted Stoke their equaliser. This is a massive result for Stoke, if not in points then in morale, and they will head into the international break with a smile on their faces: Sunderland, Hull City and Swansea await on the other side. Stoke might still be in the relegation zone, but on this showing, they will be absolutely fine. </p> <p>United squandered a few chances, but Paul Pogba was especially guilty today, missing the target on three separate occasions when it was surely easier for the \u00a393m man to score. </p> <p>Thanks for reading and for your emails and tweets.

  "<p>David Davis, the secretary of state for exiting the European Union, attended a seminar at Oxford University last month that drew up a blueprint for hard Brexit, the term describing Britain\u2019s total departure from the bloc. </p> <p>The seminar at All Souls college on 9 September was also attended by leading pro-Brexit MPs, legal and trade experts who broadly support a hard Brexit from the EU, and senior civil servants.</p> <p>The group proposed the \u201dgreat repeal bill\u201d set out on Sunday by Theresa May, the prime minister, as well as an early triggering of article 50, the clause that starts the two-year timetable for the Brexit negotiations.

They also stressed he did not endorse the conclusions of the Legatum report.</p> <p>Those conclusions bear a remarkable resemblance to the government\u2019s work on Brexit to date, and the attendance of such high-ranking figures as Davis suggests it will continue to remain influential.</p> <p>The summary published last week states the seminar \u201cconcluded that the government should now make due haste with sending an article 50 letter and introducing a repeal bill for the 1972 European Communities Act\u201d.</p> <p>It adds: \u201cThe country and business wish to reduce the uncertainty.\u201d The seminar \u201cwas swayed by a survey of larger businesses and by the business debate into seeing the need for speed, and the opportunities that flow from exit\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/02/article-50-timescale-theresa-may-brexit\">What will happen now timescale for article 50 has been revealed?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The report says the seminar \u201cwas persuaded that leaving the EU is primarily a UK parliamentary process, repealing the 1972 act and renewing EU law as UK law to ensure continuity. </p> <p>\u201cThere was general agreement that this is best done by means of a short general principles and powers bill, mirroring exactly the short legislation of the 1972 act to impose the EU legal authority in the first place.\u201d</p> <p>The seminar also concluded that legal proceedings due to start soon intended to produce a court ruling that would force a parliamentary vote on the triggering of article 50 would not succeed. The report suggests: \u201cThe best course could be to pass a Commons motion in support of a letter and to send it as soon as possible, whatever the state of the legal proceedings.\u201d</p> <p>It also suggests May should explore what kind of future trading relationship the EU commission seeks with the UK, suggesting the issue is largely for the EU to determine.</p> <p>It says the conference \u201cwas sympathetic to the view that the trade negotiations can be short and simple. The UK can offer either to carry forward current tariff-free trade with service sector passports, or to fall back on the World Trade Organisation standard-tariff trade. The UK would recommend the former, but could live with the latter. Rather than negotiate, it is just a question of which the rest of the EU will choose.\u201d </p> <p>It concludes \u201cWhilst the EU commission is likely to threaten the imposition of WTO rules, the member states are likely to opt for the status quo of tariff-free trade given business lobbies in their own countries. </p> <p>\u201cThe balance of trade and tariff rates under WTO rules is more damaging to the rest of the EU than to the UK, given the UK\u2019s bias to services which are all tariff-free, and given the devaluation of the pound which has already made rest of the EU products less price-competitive without extra tariffs.\u201d</p> <p>The report on the conference gives an optimistic assessment of the balance of forces on trade talks, stating: \u201cIt was also confirmed that the UK remains a member of the WTO, and establishing the same or a new tariff schedule with the WTO for trade with the EU would be easy, given we would be taking either our current tariff-free approach or the standard EU rest of the world tariff schedule.</p> <p>\u201cWhat takes time in international trade is negotiating a new deal between two countries with substantial barriers, which is the opposite of the case of the UK/EU where all tariff barriers have been removed.\u201d</p> <p>All Souls said it was neutral on the issue of Brexit, and was simply hosting the discussion. </p>",
  "<p>Some years ago, in the guise of Rugby League Week\u2019s \u201cMan On The Hill\u201d, I headed down to Remondis Stadium, the home ground of Cronulla Sharks. There on the hill I laughed along with the Sharks fans as their centre-three-quarter Ben Pomeroy dropped the ball, time and again. We laughed like fiends.</p> <p>Such was the lot of your average Sharks fan \u2013 you just laughed. What else could you do? It was like you owned the players and their errors. They were the fans\u2019 errors. And it was all a big gag, a bit like the Barmy Army celebrating their terrible team by singing songs of their badness. It was the height of good humour.</p> <p>But they\u2019re laughing long and loud for a different reason now, Sharks fans, because their improbable rugby league team has made off with the Provan-Summons trophy. In a hard-boned and willing grand final at Sydney\u2019s ANZ Stadium in front of a near capacity 83,625 people, a heaving, pulsating, roiling sky-blue sea, with occasional algal blooms of two-tone purple, saw a great game of rugby league.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/gallery/2016/oct/02/nrl-grand-final-cronulla-sharks-vs-melbourne-storm-in-pictures\">NRL grand final: Cronulla Sharks vs Melbourne Storm \u2013 in pictures</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There was intent early. Brutish intent. As Knights enforcer Paul Harragon said before the 1997 decider, \u201cYou can\u2019t get sent off in a grand final\u201d. And it\u2019s probably true. You\u2019d have to be really bad. Early on, the players set out to test it. Mick Ennis threw a high shot in the first twenty seconds. Marika Koroibete swung a forearm at Chad Townsend\u2019s Rick Astley-looking head and was put on report. He\u2019s off to rugby, though, Koroibete and thus had license to kill. Maybe not kill. But he was put on report and won\u2019t serve a sentence on the Wallabies\u2019 spring tour.</p> <p>Giant Cronulla prop Andrew Fifita was a factor early, and throughout. Luke Lewis would win the Clive Churchill Medal, and had a great game, his head finishing like a very bad boxer\u2019s, his cheeks like Cro-Magnon man\u2019s. But Fifita was huge, a real factor. \u201cThe Fifita Factor\u201d: ordinary airport novel, but the man was up there with the best on ground. </p> <p>Storm lock Dale Finucane\u2019s defence was staunch, this chunky jack-hammer of a man. Dean Lance redux. Lewis almost scored a try from a James Maloney burst, slid towards the try-line but couldn\u2019t reach out and score because the double-movement law\u2019s an ass. It\u2019s not the worst law in rugby league. But it\u2019s one of them.</p> <p>Bouncing Ben Barba scored the first try from a scrum move that referees sent to the bunker because referees couldn\u2019t believe someone had ripped it off. <em>Can you do that? Is that allowed? </em>The move went like this: halfback fed under the lock\u2019s feet, the lock took off with it, turned it back inside to the second-rower \u2013 Barba \u2013 who scooted over the line. And up went \u201cTRY\u201d and up went the Shark people, happy as Leisure Suit Larry.</p> <p>And from there the Sharks\u2019 bombed in. All the momentum. It was the same momentum they\u2019ve had all year. They just kept on coming, playing footy, and rucking their way down field \u2013 equal parts hot potato Raiders and staunch-wall Storm. A heady combination.</p> <p>Jack Bird hurt his arm, it hung limp like a deadweight. \u201cBird has one wing,\u201d said commentator Ray Warren. Someone had to say it. And Our Rabbi did, God bless him for it.</p> <p>On field the Sharks ran fast and with intensity, all hard bodies, footwork and endeavour. Storm couldn\u2019t hold them, couldn\u2019t slow things down. Normally they do. That\u2019s their thing \u2013 brutalise their opponents, kill the ruck with the moves of judo. Cop a penalty. Do it again. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ed7923a55c83e250796882c44946ee1fbc620e88\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ed7923a55c83e250796882c44946ee1fbc620e88/0_0_4714_3289/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cronulla Sharks players celebrate their 2016 NRL premiership win\" width=\"1000\" height=\"698\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cronulla Sharks players celebrate their 2016 NRL premiership win.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Craig Golding/AAP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Not this game. And referees Matt Cecchin and Ben Cummins, it seems, have adjudicated a clean one. The Sharks, freed up, broke free of the human net and won the ruck. Won the first half. Only 8-nil. But they owned it.</p> <p>Yet the Storm were good. Their completions were \u201cperfect\u201d. They played \u201cStormball\u201d. But the Sharks played footy. And monstered the Storm.</p> <p>On field Ennis continued to menace. It\u2019s what he does. He rubbed it in, he annoyed, he pushed people. He\u2019s probably the game\u2019s most disliked opponent. And fair enough, he\u2019s not out there to be nice. \u201cHe\u2019s in their heads,\u201d reckoned Phil Gould of the latest Ennis-inspired push-n-shove. And say what you will about Ennis, love him or hate, agree or disagree, one thing is clear: he\u2019s a grub.</p> <p>In the second half it was more of the same; Sharks just hammering away, bludgeoning the Storm line. Yet Storm, again, held firm. They love that stuff. Love copping it and throwing it back. And back they came. It\u2019s what they do. They stay cool and play their Stormball. \u201cCool\u201d will be on Cam Smith\u2019s tombstone. His resting heart-rate is just above dead. </p> <p>The Sharks were bashed. Head bin here. Bad knee there. \u201cHe\u2019s still on one wing, the Bird man,\u201d said Warren again, warming to the theme. And from nothing Jesse Bromwhich, the indomitable giant of New Zealand, rumbled over for a try. It had been all Sharks. But they only led by two. It was in their heads. How could it not be? They knew Storm would not go away, would not panic. But hell! They\u2019d smashed them for 55 minutes. Still couldn\u2019t shake \u2018em. <em>Who are these people?</em> </p> <p>Koroibete ran on one wing. Will Chambers ran on the other. Channel Nine threw up a statistic: Storm had completed 28 of 30 sets; Sharks 22 of 24. There was 22 minutes to go. It was a close to \u201cperfect\u201d game. And still anyone\u2019s.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/02/cronulla-sharks-beat-melbourne-to-break-50-year-nrl-premiership-drought\">Cronulla Sharks beat Melbourne to break 50-year NRL premiership drought | Sam Perry</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Chambers stepped Ennis and scored a try that took his team into the lead. Gallen\u2019s head went into his hands. <em>Oh the humanity! How could this be? Had we not thrown our everything at them? They are like a piece of iron. They are not human. </em>And it was true. No human could weather such a Shark attack and survive. But Storm had beaten it, eaten it, owned it. And now led by four points.</p> <p>Fifteen to go and you couldn\u2019t pick a standout player. Willing replacement punk Christian Welch threw an ill-advised swinging arm at Townsend\u2019s very bad haircut. Fifita rock-and-rolled over through a phalanx of judo-trained bodyguards to somehow plant the ball under the posts. Try-time. A marvel of human movement.</p> <p>Sharks by two. Sweet Jesus and DK Lillee it was tense. Cronk stabbed for the line and Bird fielded at second-slip. Maloney kicked out on the full trying to kill off a set. And the Storm came again and again.

And still they came, these horrible automatons. What a team. What a club. They can never be killed. But the Sharks made a desperate late tackle on Koroibete. Time off. Ennis hugged some ball-boys. And the Shire went up as one.</p> <p>Now Cronulla are premiers of the National Rugby League. First time in their 49-year existence. How about it? It\u2019s magnificent. And in Cronulla, they\u2019re laughing.</p>",

Despite its association with the grunge 90s \u2013 or maybe because of it \u2013 Rock the Vote still exists, even if the idea of \u201crocking\u201d is about as relevant to the youth vote as a rotary phone. This year, Rock the Vote is joining forces with Glamour magazine, Refinery29, Jezebel and the Cut to register at least 100,000 women before the election, an initiative called #OurVoteCounts. As one would imagine with the strategic placement of the hashtag in the name, most of this registration drive will take place online, unlike the TV-centric campaigns of yesteryear. To better appeal to its newer, younger, sexier partners, Rock the Vote might want to also consider rebranding for the 21st century \u2013 maybe something like Electric Democracy Carnival? Organizers can hold voter registration drives in the desert, hand out glow sticks and pacifiers, and build a giant wooden statue of Thomas Jefferson that they can set on fire every evening.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d39fa66113621b5d51d90e5b654a09d03ee180fa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d39fa66113621b5d51d90e5b654a09d03ee180fa/0_0_2934_1760/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kevin Liles, Mary J Blige, Russell Simmons, Puff Daddy, and Jay Z on stage at the Last Chance For Change Rally in support of Barack Obama on 2 November 2008 in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kevin Liles, Mary J Blige, Russell Simmons, Puff Daddy, and Jay Z on stage at the Last Chance For Change Rally in support of Barack Obama on 2 November 2008 in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Larry Marano/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Still, it\u2019s good to see Rock The Vote make the jump from the airwaves to the internet.

There is an increasing awareness in this country that something\u2019s gone wrong. Millennial dissatisfaction with the course that the United States is taking is growing. Earlier this year,<a href=\"http://elections.ap.org/suntimes/content/divided-america-diverse-millennials-are-no-voting-monolith-1\"> the GenForward survey</a>, a collaboration between the Black Youth Project and the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research at the University of Chicago, discovered that 52% of millennials feel the country is \u201cfalling behind\u201d and another 24% believe it\u2019s \u201cfailing\u201d. That <a href=\"http://www.apnorc.org/PDFs/GenForward/GenForward%20June%202016%20BYP%20Report.pdf\">same study</a> found that 17% of black millennials aren\u2019t planning to vote, which could be a devastating blow for Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign, as she\u2019ll be relying on the youth and minority vote to overcome Trump\u2019s significant advantage with white Americans.</p> <p>The apathy of the millennial voter might simply be a symptom of having two candidates in their late 60s or early 70s who don\u2019t have the air of hipness that Barack Obama employed. What pops a hole in that theory is that millennial voting rates <a href=\"http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2013/05/08/six-take-aways-from-the-census-bureaus-voting-report/\">fell</a> 7% from 2008 to 2012. Instead, there\u2019s the very real possibility that as millennials age, they are less apt to stomach a thing called hope. The Obama presidency did not usher in a new age of cooperation. Nancy Pelosi and John Boehner did not announce they would be going on a nationwide concert tour performing the hits of the Carpenters. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/30/millennials-latino-voters-clinton-trump\">\u2018We don\u2019t have a choice\u2019: young Latinos on why they're voting for Clinton</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Racial tension, climate change, gun violence, terrorism, and poverty persist.

  "<p>\u201cThe heartache is still there. I take one day at a time.\u201d<br></p> <p>Aaron Esh Jr is only 23, but he carries the weight of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/oct/03/usgunviolence.topstories3\">the terrible events of a day 10 years ago</a>. On 2 October 2006, in a one-room school house deep in Pennsylvania Amish country, he was the oldest student present. A local man burst in, tied up 10 girls and shot them.</p> <p>Five died and five survived.</p> <p>For a long time, Esh wrestled with himself, tormented by the idea that he could somehow have saved his classmates. He still struggles with the memories.</p> <p>There have been many mass shootings across America in the 10 years since the shooting in the tiny village of Nickel Mines, some with much higher death tolls. But the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/oct/03/usgunviolence.topstories3\">Amish school shooting</a> still strikes a chord. The attacker preyed on the most innocent and defenseless members of a determinedly bucolic and pacifistic religious community. Within hours, the Amish announced they had forgiven him.</p> <p>This week, families whose children were at the school that day held a special picnic to mark the 10-year anniversary. First responders also attended. On Sunday, Christ Stoltzfus will visit the grave of his daughter, Anna Mae, who was 12 years old when she died. She is buried in a local cemetery, with the other girls who were killed.</p> <p>\u201cIt will be comforting, but also painful,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Another of Stoltzfus\u2019s daughters, Sarah Ann, was shot but survived. She is now \u201ca healthy 18-year-old\u201d who has recovered well, he said.</p> <p>None of those affected by \u201cthe happening\u201d, as the community calls it, have left the tight-knit community or the Amish faith itself, Stoltzfus said. Their old-world <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/oct/04/usgunviolence.usa1\">way of life</a> has not changed. The Amish still eschew cars and do not rely on phones, factors which meant that 10 years ago, news of the shooting was slow to reach parents.</p> <p>But the inhabitants of Nickel Mines do now have closer relationships with outsiders, after so many came to their aid. And in the aftermath of other mass shootings, especially those at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/virginiatech\">Virginia Tech</a> and at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/newtown-shooting\">Sandy Hook elementary school</a> in Connecticut, bereaved and despairing families have turned to the Amish for advice.</p> <p>Even so, there are effects that linger and details of the event that have never been well understood.</p> <h2>\u2018We still wonder: why did it happen?\u2019</h2> <p>Aaron Esh Jr sat in his gas-lit family kitchen. From outside came the sound of rain and horse-drawn carriages on a country road. In all directions, the rolling landscape was dotted with grain silos, cornfields and barns.</p> <p>\u201cEveryone is doing pretty well, for the best part,\u201d Esh began. \u201cBut we still wonder: why did it happen?\u201d</p> <p>Despite the Amish\u2019s legendary powers of forgiveness, he said, it was a struggle to stay constant. \u201cYou have to fight the bitter thoughts,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Public accounts usually summarize how Charles Roberts, 32, a non-Amish local resident, entered the school house on a Monday morning, and how after the teacher fled to find help, he ordered all the boys to leave and then shot the girls. But Esh\u2019s father, Aaron Esh Sr, said survivors had told how, as Roberts brandished a pistol, he ordered all the children to lie down at the front of the class, below the blackboard. Not just the girls.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"9717f9082a23ac2aaa618d58d0e9fd7619a6138c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9717f9082a23ac2aaa618d58d0e9fd7619a6138c/0_0_3504_2336/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Amish shooting\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A group of women talk to officials at a police line at the intersection of Mine Road and White Oak Road, on 4 October 2006.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mary Altaffer/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When Roberts began tying the girls up and pulled down the window shades, Esh Sr said, children began weeping with fear.<br></p> <p>\u201cThe boys were terrified, too,\u201d he said, rubbing his ample beard.</p> <p>Just before he barricaded himself and the girls inside, Roberts let the boys go. Aaron Jr went outside, then panicked because his little brother Joel was still inside. Joel, then seven, was the last boy out. Seven minutes after the teacher raised the alarm, state troopers arrived.</p> <p>It is believed Roberts planned to sexually molest the girls during a lengthy siege. He told them, survivors said, that he was angry at God because his baby daughter had died despite his prayers. He also said he had molested two young female relatives when a teen, a claim that was never proven. When the <a href=\"http://lancasteronline.com/news/troopers-talk-about-horror-of-nickel-mines-school-tragedy/article_63c8a42f-7110-5e3e-b14f-d36860abf17a.html\">troopers came</a>, he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/oct/05/usgunviolence.usa\">fired</a> at each of the 10 girls, then shot himself dead.</p> <p>The community convulsed in shock and grief. The boys had a lucky escape, so everyone said. But they themselves were traumatized.</p> <p>\u201cAaron had survivor\u2019s guilt,\u201d said his father. \u201cHe lost his childhood that day. It bothered him and other boys that they had not done something. Some of them are still struggling with that, 10 years on.\u201d In the months afterwards, he said, his son \u201calways had a fear that it would happen again\u201d.</p> <p>Within days, the community knocked down the school house. In April 2007, Esh Sr said, when they had just finished building a new school and moved the surviving children there, \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/virginiatech\">Virginia Tech</a> happened\u201d. In Blacksburg, Virginia, a disturbed student killed 32 students and members of staff. Many in Nickel Mines were distressed all over again.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>He couldn\u2019t control what had happened in his life \u2026 but there was something he could control and that was what he ate</p> <footer> <cite>Aaron Esh Sr, on his son</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cThat hit Aaron real hard,\u201d Esh Sr said. </p> <p>Aaron Jr\u2019s mother, Anna Mary, said her son became very good at cooking for the rest of the family, but ate nothing himself.</p> <p>\u201cWe couldn\u2019t get him to eat,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Aaron Jr went through a growth spurt that winter, growing from 5ft 1in to 5ft 6in, but his weight dropped from 120lb to 90lb. \u201cHe was completely anorexic. He was like a toothpick,\u201d Esh Sr said. </p> <p>The boy would come home early from school, having panic attacks. Like most of the survivors and bereaved, he and his brother accepted counselling from outside professional therapists. But Aaron Jr was depressed. In the summer of 2007, he ended up in a secure hospital ward, close to death from starvation. He spent many painful months recovering, the family said.</p> <p>\u201cThe only way it was explained to us was that he couldn\u2019t control what had happened in his life that day, but there was something he could control and that was what he ate,\u201d Esh Sr said.</p> <p>Aaron Jr said that around that time, three state troopers came to visit him. They sat outside on the porch, he said, and told him what happened at the school was not his fault. If he had tried to intervene, they said, the outcome would probably have been a lot worse.</p> <p>\u201cIt meant so much to me to hear it from them,\u201d he said. \u201cIt saved my sanity. If it hadn\u2019t been for that I don\u2019t know how I would have handled it. At one point I had had thoughts of suicide.\u201d</p> <p>Then he smiled. He hopes to have a wife and children one day, he said, but he currently has \u201cno plans\u201d and is taking \u201cone day at a time\u201d. He works in the construction industry.</p> <h2>\u2018Shoot me first\u2019</h2> <p>Two years ago, Barbara Fisher, now 20, got married. Ten years ago, she was shot multiple times in the shoulder and hand. Her younger sister Emma, then nine, was the only girl who managed to escape the school room before the shooting started, quietly walking out while Roberts struggled with a faulty window shade. Their older sister, Marian, was killed. She was 13.</p> <p>Barbara, known as Barbie, later said that in the petrifying minutes that Roberts stood over the girls, holding a gun and talking about taking revenge on God, Marian said: \u201cShoot me first.\u201d Barbie followed, saying: \u201cShoot me second.\u201d Anna Mae said: \u201cShoot me next.\u201d</p> <p>Talking on Thursday on their sprawling dairy farm, where they raise 40 cows on pasture, corn and alfalfa and also grow tobacco, the girls\u2019 parents, John and Linda Fisher, said no one had been able to figure out exactly what Marian meant. At the time, Marian was widely held to have displayed superhuman courage, in an attempt to protect the younger girls. Now, the truth remains a mystery. John Fisher said Barbie had said her sister\u2019s face was full of distress, not stoicism, when she spoke.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4718d5ddb2d14817f918df59a1fdce2818503cc5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4718d5ddb2d14817f918df59a1fdce2818503cc5/0_9_2014_1208/1000.jpg\" alt=\"People walk near the schoolhouse in Nickel Mines on 4 October 2006.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">People walk near the schoolhouse in Nickel Mines on 4 October 2006.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matt Rourke/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Marian should not be thought of as more special than any other child caught up in the events of that day, the Fishers said. They also said the decision by the community <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/oct/16/usgunviolence.usa\">to forgive</a> the killer and his family was not as simple as it has been seen to be.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a once and done thing,\u201d said Linda Fisher. \u201cIt is a lifelong process.\u201d</p> <p>As a principle, forgiveness is closely adhered to by the Amish. But it takes a while for each person\u2019s emotions to catch up with such an outward decision, John Fisher said. When he saw the wounded girls fighting for their lives in the hospital, he was angry.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s when it hit me,\u201d he said. \u201cAs a father, I felt helpless.\u201d</p> <p>Both parents agreed it was \u201ca huge relief\u201d that Roberts did not go through with his planned sexual assaults. If he had lived, they said, they would have wanted justice served \u2013 though not the death penalty.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.etown.edu/centers/young-center/staff.aspx\">Steven Nolt</a>, a professor of history and Anabaptist studies at the region\u2019s Elizabethtown College and co-author of the book <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Amish-Grace-Forgiveness-Transcended-Tragedy/dp/0470344040\">Amish Grace: How Forgiveness Transcended Tragedy</a>, said the decision to forgive the killer would have been collective and about \u201cgiving up the right to revenge and grudges\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe essence of Amish life is about giving up,\u201d he said. \u201cGiving up self to the group, to God. From how one dresses to the kind of work one does, Amish life is shaped by rituals of self-surrender.\u201d The Amish did not want to be thought of as saintly, he said, nor as \u201cstoically stuffing their feelings into a box\u201d.</p> <p>On the day of the killings, members of the Nickel Mines community took food to Roberts\u2019 widow. Six days after the shooting, families who had just buried their daughters attended Roberts\u2019 funeral. Money from funds that poured in from around the world was diverted to the killer\u2019s family, even though many victims faced huge medical bills.</p> <p>Aaron Esh Sr said the bereaved parents started to look at forgiveness as \u201cthe one good thing that can come out of this tragedy\u201d. With Roberts dead, he said, there was nowhere for the anger to go. There had been no foreshadowing of his ghastly act. He was known only as a loving husband and father, a good neighbor.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"fedf995e01794ea6f24155208dba1b99ed221f0a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fedf995e01794ea6f24155208dba1b99ed221f0a/0_0_3000_2104/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Amish shooting funeral\" width=\"1000\" height=\"701\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A procession of Amish carriages moves through Georgetown during the funeral of Anna Mae Stoltzfus, on 6 October 2006.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris Hondros/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Amish believe that harboring anger and resentment is corrosive. \u201cIt will eat you up,\u201d Esh Sr said.

She has seizures.</p> <p>Esh Sr and others met with families bereaved at Virginia Tech and at Sandy Hook, where 20 children and six staff were killed in 2012.</p> <p>\u201cTerri Roberts rode in a bus with us to Sandy Hook and the families and teachers there could not believe that we would even associate with her, let alone that she would come up there with us,\u201d he said.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It took me a few years until I could feel that I really meant it inside me, to forgive Charlie</p> <footer> <cite>Christ Stoltzfus</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Christ Stoltzfus recalled the shock of the day 10 years ago when he, like the Fishers, had to deal with the news that one of his daughters was dead and one wounded.

While their two drivers and head of motorsport, Toto Wolff, dissected the day, a number of cardboard boxes were carried out of the team\u2019s paddock hospitality centre.

He has rarely looked as distraught as this.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5cce77a1e9e791364946716aa75149e60c81c78c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5cce77a1e9e791364946716aa75149e60c81c78c/0_24_3992_2396/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lewis Hamilton climbs from his smoking car as he retires from the Malaysian Grand Prix.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lewis Hamilton climbs from his smoking car as he retires from the Malaysian Grand Prix.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tee/LAT/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Everyone in F1 knows Hamilton is the faster driver by some distance. But he seems destined to lose his title this year \u2013 and to a rival whom he has dominated in various arenas for more than 20 years.</p> <p>Wolff thought he would be leading a celebration but instead found himself conducting an inquest. This, after all, was the fourth time \u2013 following <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/apr/14/lewis-hamilton-five-place-grid-penalty-chinese-grand-prix\" title=\"\">China</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/26/lewis-hamilton-belgian-grand-prix-grid-penalty\" title=\"\">Belgium</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/apr/30/lewis-hamilton-suffers-nico-rosberg-pole-russian-f1-gp\" title=\"\">Russia</a> \u2013 that Hamilton\u2019s race had been wrecked for reasons beyond his control and that does not include his awful starts in Australia, Bahrain, Canada and Italy, where the driver has experienced clutch difficulties for which he may not be entirely to blame. Amid the mayhem Wolff strove to appear sanguine. \u201cThis is a mechanical sport,\u201d he said with a shrug. \u201cIt\u2019s a very unfortunate coincidence. It\u2019s been really bad for him and for the team. I have no words. I\u2019m gutted in the same way.\u201d</p> <p>When he was asked about Hamilton\u2019s immediate post-race comments, in which the driver said there was someone who did not want him to win the title this year, without immediately making it clear whether he was referring to God or Mercedes, Wolff smiled, in a grim sort of way. \u201cEvery remark, every answer [Hamilton made] is allowed after such a frustrating moment,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cIf you\u2019re in the lead and about to get back in the championship and the engine blows up, and a microphone is put in front of your face, he is allowed to say whatever he wants. It\u2019s completely understandable.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2016/oct/02/f1-malaysian-grand-prix-live\">Australia's Daniel Ricciardo wins Malaysian Grand Prix - as it happened</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cEach of us will have expressed his frustration in different ways.

The failures have not been linked. There is no pattern that we can identify.\u201d</p> <p>Wolff praised Hamilton for going back to his mechanics and engineers to lift them for the challenge of Japan next weekend. \u201cLewis was trying to pick up the team, which only the greatest do. In such a moment to find moments to pick the engineers up for the next race, it was really great.\u201d</p> <p>Would Rosberg be described as a lucky champion? \u201cThese things happen \u2026 Nico had a failure at the start of the last race in 2014. It\u2019s frustrating that it comes at a crucial moment in the championship. We are letting Lewis down this year. I don\u2019t think it will have put any shadow on the championship. And the championship isn\u2019t over yet.\u201d</p> <p>It is not over but the pattern looks increasingly irrevocable.</p>",

I then thought of Dragons fans crying into their jumpers, inconsolable at what had just taken place: </p> <p>Turn away, Dragons fans, take yourself to your happy place (or just watch up until Nathan Blacklock\u2019s belting try then stop the video):</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETgWxcurqlk\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ETgWxcurqlk?wmode=opaque\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57f0b12be4b0ab006308706c\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-02T07:07:33.211Z\">8.07am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Pre-ramble</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Good evening, welcome to this grand final live blog</strong>, a blow-by-blow account of the Cronulla Sharks\u2019 attempt to overcome the weight of their own historical mediocrity, and the might of the Melbourne Storm, and win their first ever premiership after 50 years of trying! </p> <p>Alternatively, welcome to this grand final live blog, a blow-by-blow account of the mighty Melbourne Storm\u2019s attempt to snuff out the dreams of perennial losers, the Cronulla Sharks, and win their third (above board) premiership since joining the NRL in 1998!</p> <p>It all depends of what perspective you take, doesn\u2019t it?</p> <p>What about the neutrals\u2019 perspective? The overriding perception is that both teams don\u2019t exactly tug on the heartstrings in the way that, say, a puppy dog rolling in toilet paper does. Or is supposed to. So, many neutrals may be apathetic at this stage as to which team to support. </p> <p>For those who go beyond neutrality, for those who dislike both teams, \u201chate \u2019em!\u201d even, well, they\u2019re in a pickle. But at least they\u2019ll have the consolation of seeing one team they loathe lose today. So that\u2019s nice.</p> <p>Strictly speaking, Cronulla are this year\u2019s obligatory fairytale team and should attract the bulk of the support. Indeed, early scenes from the ground show a sea of light blue. Or that could just be the colour of the seats.</p> <p> But as I said in my preview on Friday: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u2026 given Cronulla\u2019s peptides scandal and the on/off-field behavioral history of the likes of Gallen, Fifita, and Ennis, men as hard to love as sand in your gusset, the Sharks\u2019 fairytale is more like something from the oeuvre of the Brothers Grimm than Disney.</p> </blockquote> <p> Quoting yourself, it\u2019s desperate isn\u2019t it? I suppose I could have spent precious time and said more or less the same thing again but in a slightly different way but sod that, right? So here I go again:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> If the Sharks aren\u2019t universally loved then neither are the Melbourne Storm who, in NSW at least, will forever be tarred with the Original Sin of being based in Victoria and of being born out of Super League in the way <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7CEbd7ffNw\">Damien (Omen)</a> was born of a jackal. Oh, and there\u2019s the don\u2019t-mention-the-war matter of the salary cap rorting that saw the Storm stripped of both their 2007 and 2009 premiership titles.</p> </blockquote> <p>Bit negative, right? But I feel it had to be acknowledged. To get it out of the way, like.</p> <p>All this isn\u2019t to say, of course, that there\u2019s no interest in this game. It\u2019s the grand final for crying out loud! I\u2019m interested. You\u2019re interested. It\u2019s why we\u2019re here.* </p> <p>It\u2019s also not to say that once the game gets underway neutrals may just find themselves drawn into a brief flirtation and cheering on one of the teams, just for the evening. Maybe even the haters might find the cloaks of bias and cynicism reefed from their shoulders.</p> <p>It\u2019s grand final day night. Anything can happen!</p> <p>Well, two things could happen. The Sharks will finally get something to put in their trophy cabinet (Do they even have a trophy cabinet? If so, what for?), or the Melbourne Storm, as relentless as a Terminator with OCD, will cap their sixth grand final appearance in 11 seasons with another premiership.</p> <p>Should be a belter. </p> <p>Join me, email me, tweet me. Share your thoughts, dear reader! </p> <p><strong>Kick-off: 7.15pm local</strong></p> <p>*I may also be getting paid. But don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s not much.

The key question they must resolve \u2013 and still a source of conflict within the government \u2013 remains whether the UK will push for enhanced access to the single market.</p> <p>That, Brussels and other EU capitals have repeatedly insisted, can only come at the price of free movement for European migrant workers, an acceptance of the single market\u2019s rules and regulations, and a contribution to Brussels\u2019s budget.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-exiting-the-european-union\">DExEU</a>, Davis\u2019s department, will model different \u201csoft\u201d and \u201chard\u201d Brexit scenarios and their impact on dozens of sectors of the UK economy, help define the cabinet\u2019s preferred Brexit target, and draw up negotiating priorities: what does Britain want, what can it not do without, what might it be prepared to sacrifice. </p> <p>Both DExEU and the government\u2019s legal department will also now begin work on the act that will repeal the 1972 European Communities Act \u2013 the law that binds EU law to the British statute book \u2013 and new legislation to transpose EU legislation into British law in its entirety.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/oct/02/conservative-conference-may-to-explain-brexit-great-repeal-bill-in-marr-interview-politics-live\">May says she will trigger article 50, starting EU withdrawal, before end of March - Politics live</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The bill, announced by May on Saturday night, will be brought forward in the next parliamentary session. It will take effect on the day Britain leaves the EU, now set at no later than the end of March 2019, with future governments able to unpick EU-derived laws as desired.</p> <p>Much of all this work will plainly need to be completed before article 50 is triggered, at which point the two-year clock starts ticking. Liam Fox\u2019s international trade department, meanwhile, is to focus primarily on exploring new trade deals with non-EU countries (none of which can be signed before Britain has left).</p> <h2>The long goodbye</h2> <p>As far as the exit process then goes, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/25/article-50-brexit-debate-britain-eu\">article 50</a> lays down the basic steps. The very first \u2013 a significant potential obstacle \u2013 states that the decision to leave has to have been taken in accordance with Britain\u2019s \u201cown constitutional requirements\u201d.</p> <p>That is one reason why nothing can happen before next year: several cases are currently before the courts arguing that the government does not have the power to invoke article 50 without parliament\u2019s approval. The issue is likely to move swiftly to the supreme court, which will be under pressure to deliver a final judgment by Christmas.</p> <p>Assuming that hurdle is cleared, article 50 says the leaving state must notify the European council \u2013 made up of the 28 heads of government, the council president, Donald Tusk, and the European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker \u2013 of its intention. This could be in the form of a letter, or a formal statement at a council meeting; the first full European council meeting of 2017 is on 9-10 March.</p> <p>Article 50 then states: \u201cIn the light of the guidelines provided by the European council, [the EU] shall negotiate and conclude an agreement with the state, setting out the arrangements for its withdrawal, taking account of the framework for its future relationship with the union.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/01/hard-brexit-new-bigotry-warns-nicky-morgan\">Hard Brexit will breed new bigotry, warns former Tory minister</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As Steve Peers, professor of EU law at the university of Essex, <a href=\"https://fullfact.org/europe/how-eu-works-leaving-eu/\">points out</a>, article 50 goes on to define three distinct stages of that withdrawal process. First, the council, in the form of its chief Brexit negotiator, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/26/belgian-diplomat-to-head-eus-brexit-taskforce\">Didier Seeuws</a>, and the member states it represents \u2013 without the UK \u2013 must agree the broad guidelines for negotiations. </p> <p>This in itself is likely likely to take some months \u2013 and may be complicated by elections in the Netherlands, France and Germany that could well see the arrival of new governments with new positions. </p> <p>Next, the commission\u2019s negotiating team, headed by the French former foreign minister and EU commissioner, Michel Barnier, and his German deputy, Sabine Weyand, negotiates the exit agreement with Britain on behalf of the EU.</p> <p>The third stage of article 50 requires the deal to be approved by the UK and qualified majority of the council: 20 of the 27 remaining states. The European parliament also has to approve it, by a simple majority (and will, its president Martin Schulz and Brexit representative Guy Verhofstadt <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/23/osborne-warns-may-against-hard-brexit\">have said</a>, be no pushover.)</p> <p>All of this, the article states, must be concluded within two years after notification \u2013 at which point Britain, unless it has won the unanimous agreement of the rest of the council, or the agreement specifies an earlier or later date, will no longer be an EU member.</p> <h2>What will the deal need to cover? </h2> <p>Charles Grant of the <a href=\"http://www.cer.org.uk/\">Centre for European Reform</a> likens it to a divorce settlement, \u201cdividing up the properties, institutions and pension rights, and dealing with budget payments and ... the rights of UK citizens in the EU and vice versa\u201d.</p> <p>The most sensible way to tackle the process, <a href=\"https://infacts.org/article-50-process-will-cats-cradle-complexity/\">according to David Hannay</a>, a highly experienced former UK ambassador to the EU, would be for both parties to first sit down and, in a largely technical first stage, agree on a list of everything that has to be covered.</p> <p>Among the most complex issues Hannay identifies are the \u201cacquired rights\u201d of UK and EU citizens, and Britain\u2019s international obligations under agreements it entered into as an EU member \u2013 such as the commitments made on its behalf at the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/apr/22/paris-climate-deal-set-signed-record-number-states-un\">Paris climate change conference</a>.</p> <p>There will also, he predicts, be \u201clengthy and contentious\u201d arguments over Britain\u2019s remaining budgetary and other financial liabilities \u2013 many complicated by the fact that EU programmes in fields such as scientific research and regional development often involve commitments beyond the exit date.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/01/tory-conference-brexit-divisions-moderate\">Bitter fight over Brexit set to overshadow Conservative conference</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>And that\u2019s not all ...</h2> <p>That is not the end. Most experts understand the phrase \u201ctaking account of the framework for its future relationship with the union\u201d to mean, however, that Britain will have to conclude two separate agreements: one on its legal separation from the union, and the other on its future trading relationship.</p> <p>Both the commission and Tusk have said talks on the trade agreement cannot start until after Britain leaves, but several member states \u2013 including Germany \u2013 have indicated that in practice, they will have to be conducted in parallel. </p> <p>In any case, Grant has argued that there will almost inevitably have to be a <a href=\"http://www.cer.org.uk/insights/theresa-may-and-her-six-pack-difficult-deals\">third agreement</a>, too: an interim arrangement to bridge the gap between Britain leaving the EU and the entry into force of the trade deal.</p> <p>That final agreement, trade experts say, could take several years to negotiate, and will be subject to unanimous voting and national ratification by all 27 remaining EU states, leaving open the possibility of almost endless haggling by every member with something to ask of Britain \u2013 think, for example, of Spain and Gibraltar. </p>",

But the uniquely polarising candidacy of Trump has raised the prospect that, with important faultlines such as age, gender, geography and race <a href=\"http://ropercenter.cornell.edu/polls/us-elections/how-groups-voted/how-groups-voted-2012/\">relatively settled from election to election</a>, socioeconomic class could swing the presidency in 2016.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4d2e9b3907d67f1653a1219f9f74a60f868acbf7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4d2e9b3907d67f1653a1219f9f74a60f868acbf7/0_221_4032_2419/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Allen Crawford and Pam Rutherford.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Allen Crawford and Pam Rutherford.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Smith/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>One marker is education. In 1992, Republican voters were much better educated than their Democratic counterparts, <a href=\"http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/09/15/educational-divide-in-vote-preferences-on-track-to-be-wider-than-in-recent-elections/\">according to the Pew Research Center</a>. Today registered voters with a college degree favour Clinton by 23 percentage points, while those without a college degree prefer Trump by five. This trend cuts across demographic groups, although it is most pronounced among whites. <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/09/trump_clinton_is_defined_by_an_educational_gap_among_white_voters.html\">The Slate website noted:</a> \u201cThe educational split among white voters is the defining characteristic of this election.\u201d If this holds in November, it will be the widest educational divide at the ballot box for several decades. </p> <p>Another marker is cultural and about optics. When Clinton recently referred to half of Trump\u2019s supporters as a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/10/hillary-clinton-trump-supporters--bigoted-deplorables\">\u201cbasket of deplorables\u201d</a>, critics also seized on the context: she was addressing millionaires at a fundraiser headlined by the singer Barbra Streisand at the New York restaurant Cipriani Wall Street. And her backers include those other temples of coastal privilege, Hollywood and Silicon Valley.</p> <p>Trump, by contrast, was anointed the \u201cblue-collar billionaire\u201d at the Republican national convention, where Willie Robertson of the TV reality show Duck Dynasty, wearing stars and stripes bandanna and bushy beard, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/07/18/duck-dynasty-star-willie-robertson-might-have-a-point-about-the-media/\">declared that media pundits</a> \u201cdon\u2019t hang out with regular folks like us, who like to hunt and fish and pray and actually work for a living. Heck, I don\u2019t even know that they know how to talk to people from middle America. I mean, when I tell \u2019em I\u2019m from Louisiana, they really start talking real slow and real loud.\u201d</p> <p>In Boonsboro, a town of 3,400 people steeped in revolutionary and civil war history, a giant Trump sign has been spraypainted with the word \u201clove\u201d. Opposite a Subway restaurant and closed-down bakery, the <a href=\"http://www.ttpbooks.com/\">Turn the Page Bookstore</a>, owned by the romance novelist Nora Roberts, sells soy candles, handmade soaps and organic coffee. Its employees make little secret of their allegiance to Clinton. Two doors away, at Crawfords Restaurant, Guns &amp; Ammo, a handwritten sign behind the laminated counter warns \u201cNo free refills on drinks\u201d and the staff are for Trump.</p> <p>As a reality show about hunting in the woods played on the TV, Rutherford, who is cashier, dishwasher, shelf stacker and much else, said of Clinton\u2019s supporters: \u201cI don\u2019t think they realise the importance of small-town America and they don\u2019t see the value of it. Everybody in this community loves this little store but big companies make it harder and harder for us.</p> <p>\u201cPeople say, \u2018You must be doing well with Obamacare\u2019. I say, actually, unless you have an astronomical salary or a company to pay for it, it\u2019s crippling. Our health insurance is $900 per month for the family; that\u2019s why I work.

But she moved to Boonsboro in 2002, where the family keeps horses, dogs and chickens on 30 acres of land and hunts 80% of their own food. Her daughters, aged 13, 14, 15 and 16, \u201call hunt and play volleyball\u201d.</p> <p>Displaying a phone picture of herself with a deer she bagged, Rutherford said: \u201cA lot of my friends don\u2019t agree with what I do but they don\u2019t have trouble wearing a full-length coyote coat to a fundraiser in January. They will wear leather shoes and carry an alligator handbag. The people of Washington don\u2019t want to go out to the rural areas; no one wants to go out of their comfort zone. But I would love to go to a Clinton rally just to eavesdrop and hear the interaction.\u201d</p> <p>Along the street, at Marly\u2019s Laundry, Wayne Stonesifer was waiting patiently as his clothes spun in a tumble dryer.

If you try to interrupt me when I\u2019m hunting, that\u2019s different.\u201d</p> <p>The country has a bigger divide now than ever, he added. \u201cYou\u2019ve got your gay rights, abortion laws, racism.

Times are getting nearer.\u201d</p> <p>Kevin Dobereiner, 36, owns two small businesses and complains that taxes are too high. He is also supporting Trump. \u201cHe\u2019s not a liberal and we\u2019re $20 trillion in debt and unemployment is too high and our healthcare is terrible. The community organiser-in-chief has no qualifications and Hillary Clinton is just an extension of that.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t care what Trump says; I care what he does and he\u2019s not a billionaire because he\u2019s stupid. I like a guy who puts his foot in his mouth because at least he tells the truth.\u201d</p> <p>Trump\u2019s plain speaking has been identified as one of the sources of his appeal to voters angry at the status quo in general and Republican establishment in particular. Even his outlandish gaffes are said to humanise him, emphasising his status as outsider and non-politician. His anti-Mexican and anti-Muslim diatribes have disgusted liberals and been cheered at raucous rallies, where he declares his love for \u201cthe poorly educated\u201d.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/experts/john-hudak/\">John Hudak</a>, a senior fellow in governance studies at the Brookings Institution thinktank in Washington, said: \u201cI think supporters look at Donald Trump and see a bit of an everyman, even though his biography completely opposes that worldview. Then they look at Hillary Clinton and see her as more elite than her background would actually suggest. Trump is the person you want to see on TLC; Clinton appears to live the way an average wealthy person lives.\u201d</p> <p>There is a crucial gender dimension, Hudak argues. \u201cA female candidate would not be allowed to ramble like Trump does or Bill Clinton did. Only in a race between a man and a woman could her polish be a liability and his freewheeling be an asset.\u201d</p> <p>Trump has scrambled the orthodoxy of class, for example by tweeting a picture of himself eating McDonald\u2019s fast food and drinking Coke on his luxurious private jet. He loves both boxing and golf. He has named Orson Welles\u2019s masterpiece Citizen Kane as his favourite film but also <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1997/05/19/trump-solo\">once told the New Yorker</a> that Bloodsport, a violent action flick starring Jean Claude Van Damme, is \u201can incredible, fantastic movie\u201d. The music at his rallies ranges from Nessun dorma, an aria from Giacomo Puccini\u2019s opera Turandot, to Elton John. His properties are crammed with chandeliers, gold leaf, mirrors and marble \u2013 tacky to some, aspirational to others. Both patrician and plebeian, his reading list is said to consist mainly of articles about himself.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"de463ffc89e6f9af955206d01524e1d9cb6c49bf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/de463ffc89e6f9af955206d01524e1d9cb6c49bf/0_153_2624_1575/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bloodsport, starring Jean Claude Van Damme\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bloodsport, starring Jean Claude Van Damme \u2026 right up there with Citizen Kane, according to Trump.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Everett Collection / Rex Feature</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Some would say he lacks class, in every sense. And there is a tenacious myth that, free of the ossified layers of agricultural and industrial Europe, America is a class-free land of opportunity, where someone born into poverty can become president. It is not so simple, according to sociologists. Arlie Hochschild of the University of California, Berkeley, and author of Strangers in Their Own Land: Anger and Mourning on the American Right, said: \u201cClass is profoundly important, imprinting all aspects of childhood, self, character and behind, and the denial of it is in the service of keeping alive the hope of lifting out of it. But America would be far better off talking about the realities of it.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.robert-h-frank.com/\">Robert H Frank</a>, a professor of economics at Cornell University and author of Success and Luck: Good Fortune and the Myth of Meritocracy, added: \u201cPeople here, if you ask them, will say they are \u2018middle class\u2019. Even relatively rich people will answer middle class because we deny there\u2019s such a thing as class here, which is of course preposterous. The barriers are different from England but they\u2019re real.\u201d<br></p> <p>Research suggests that Trump\u2019s core support should not be simply characterised as the white working class. Many earn an average of $70,000 but are caught in the downdraft of deindustrialisation, losing jobs to factory or mine closures, lacking the skills for a digital economy, anxious that their children will be worse off than they were. Joe Sims, a member of the national board of the <a href=\"http://www.cpusa.org/\">Communist Party USA</a>, said: \u201cMy sense is that Trump\u2019s support comes not so much from the white working class but the lower middle class and small business people who have been pushed into the ranks of the working class. The wages are flat and they\u2019re pissed off.\u201d</p> <p>But in a supposedly classless society, there is often a gap between perception and reality. Sims added: \u201cDuring the 1950s and 1960s there was a myth propagated about the American dream and the American way of life and the sense that everyone was middle class and upwardly mobile. Certainly during that period there was at least a steadiness in increase in income and their children were able to do a little better than them. But this idea of everyone being middle class has crashed on the rocks of reality. Wages have been stagnant since the 1970s.\u201d</p> <p>Numerous academic studies have found that the extent of social mobility was probably always exaggerated and, in the past generation, may have become deteriorated. The <a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/2015/06/16/why-college-costs-are-so-high-and-rising.html\">soaring cost of studying at university</a> has been blamed for stifling upward movement and allowing middle-class families to entrench their advantage. Pew\u2019s research, published last week, found a growing ideological divide, with highly educated adults holding increasingly liberal attitudes, while under a third of the less educated held liberal views.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.gqrr.com/stanley-b-greenberg\">Stanley Greenberg</a>, a veteran political consultant and senior pollster for Bill Clinton, said: \u201cI think we\u2019ll see the biggest divide between working-class voters and those with a college degree in this election. It\u2019s already there in the polls. Trump is reinforcing it by the nature of the campaign he\u2019s running and the issues he\u2019s running on. He\u2019s driving away college graduates as well as the whole Republican party.\u201d</p> <p>In the Republican primaries, Trump the class warrior made Ted Cruz, the conservative Christian ideologue, look quaint. Greenberg admits that he was surprised. \u201cThe college-educated Republicans keep moving year after year more to the Democrats but this election has really accelerated it because it\u2019s the first time we\u2019ve had a candidate running on a straight working-class campaign. [George W] Bush was very much centred on faith; that\u2019s legitimate but it wasn\u2019t an economic argument.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e5dc7a677059bc63c7fddeaebf61f57d116739e6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e5dc7a677059bc63c7fddeaebf61f57d116739e6/0_69_3000_1801/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bernie Sanders stressed income inequality in the primary campaign but Hillary Clinton has yet to emulate his success with the issue.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bernie Sanders stressed income inequality in the primary campaign but Hillary Clinton has yet to emulate his success with the issue.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Justin Sullivan/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>However, he warned against an oversimplified binary split, pointing to the success of Bernie Sanders, the senator from Vermont, in the Democratic primaries. Sanders stressed issues of economic inequality and access to college education, to the extent that he was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/03/bernie-sanders-failure-diversity-hispanic-black-voters\">criticised by some for neglecting race</a>.</p> <p>\u201cThere were a lot of Democrats who were voting for somebody who was a self-described socialist, running against big money, getting big money out of politics, going after Wall Street and big banks, attacking Hillary for being a creature of the big banks, so you need a third bucket,\u201d Greenberg said. \u201cThere are others who are not so focused on the racial and cultural issues who are quite ready to rally. Sanders, in the polls at least, was stronger than Hillary against Trump because he actually was winning both millennials and working-class voters.\u201d</p> <p>But now Sanders is out, there are two historically unpopular candidates and a fear of two classes, or tribes, or nations, mutually hostile and suspicious. Like the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\">Brexit vote in Britain,</a> a painful rift has been exposed and polling day itself will not necessarily heal it. If diehard Clinton and Trump supporters sat down to dinner tonight, would they find much to talk about?</p> <p>In Chevy Chase, an affluent neighbourhood in north-west Washington DC, an area where deer roam audaciously in the gardens of multimillion-dollar houses, Trump fans are hard to find.

Trump is a regrettable example of the latter. He has no politics and caters to the worst part of the American psyche. He caters to people who don\u2019t know what fascism is.\u201d</p> <p>Asked his opinion of Trump\u2019s supporters, Avdoyan replied: \u201cThey\u2019re scared little people.\u201d</p> <p>And how would they regard him? \u201cI\u2019m gay.

Anderton said: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to talk to people who were Trump supporters. I wouldn\u2019t want to engage with them.\u201d </p> <p>Cohn responded: \u201cI would, even if they\u2019re \u2018deplorables\u2019. Bring them on. Those voting for Trump think it\u2019s two different countries and two different cultures. They see liberals and Democrats as alien life forms. I grew up in a rural environment and it\u2019s not like guns are totally alien to us. It\u2019s part of class, educational, geographical resentment: it\u2019s more their perception than my perception.\u201d</p> <p>America has been described as a split-screen nation and it is, of course, about much more than class: some polls show Trump <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/07/13/new-polls-in-pennsylvania-and-ohio-show-donald-trump-with-0-percent-of-the-black-vote/\">at 0% among African American voters</a>. But this is the year that a Republican, campaigning as an anti-intellectual vulgarian, won over many who feel neglected by what they view as the metropolitan intelligentsia.

  "<p>A naked middle-aged man is sitting on a donkey, captured in the cool light of northern European art, unsparing of its description of flesh. The image is a self-portrait by the German-born art and fashion photographer Juergen Teller, shot in the London workplace that the British architects <a href=\"http://www.6a.co.uk/\">6a</a> have designed for him. He tells how, as a young man travelling in Turkey, he was nearly raped while riding such a beast, by the man sitting behind him. This photograph, he says, is \u201cmy way of making my peace with donkeys\u201d.</p> <p>To the casual eye there\u2019s not much to see in the grey architecture in which the picture was taken. It\u2019s certainly less arresting than the Teutonic Silenus or ass-centaur in the centre. But the space is integral to the image: by a combination of intent and chance, 6a\u2019s building is a landscape that acts as a setting, prompt and influence on Teller\u2019s work. It is an active participant, sometimes conspicuous and sometimes not, which is what architecture should be.</p> <p>As <a href=\"http://www.emerson.arch.ethz.ch/\">Tom Emerson</a> of 6a puts it, Teller is not a studio photographer, but uses \u201cthe natural environment, just where it is\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>During a shoot the studio can have the frenzy of a baroque court. At other times it is monastic, a place of quiet work</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>He might shoot in a hotel bathroom or the back of a limousine. The ostensible purpose of the new building was therefore to serve all the pre- and post-production work that goes with photography, the planning of props and personnel that a shoot requires, the refinement of the tone and balance of images, the laying out of books and exhibitions, more than to make a place where photographs might actually be taken.</p> <p>As the project progressed, however, its site became the sort of environment that inspires Teller. He was engaged by the spectacle of trees being lifted into place in its courtyard gardens, their rootballs neatly wrapped. He was also struck by the costs involved: \u201cOh my God, are you kidding me? I had to pay \u00a320,000 just to have the street closed so they could get the trees in. OK, so I might as well photograph it. Then I got inspired.\u201d So trees became a favoured prop and subject. He shot workmen labouring to insert one in the ground: \u201cI find that really poetic, like those Americans putting their flag up. You know\u2026 <a href=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/a1/WW2_Iwo_Jima_flag_raising.jpg\">Iwo Jima</a>.\u201d</p> <p>The building site became a location, as did the exterior of the building, in an area of west London that is punctuated by industrial units (still), postwar housing and flyovers, as eventually did the completed interiors. Teller shot a famous actress with urban foxes he found inhabiting the property. He snapped himself bathing in one of the fish pools into which rainwater runs, wearing a German football fan\u2019s curly wig in black, red and gold. The donkey was shoved and cajoled into the building. \u201cCan I ride the donkey? Can I be naked?\u201d he asked the handler. \u201cI could do whatever I liked, except put two people on it. Then the donkey police would come along.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"8c916cbda9a94e2b73d3650998c568ef7ee462b1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8c916cbda9a94e2b73d3650998c568ef7ee462b1/0_0_5599_4479/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Concrete floors, walls, ceilings, stairs, paving and a strong rhythm of concrete beams\u2019: 6a architects\u2019 \u2018apparently simple\u2019 design for Juergen Teller\u2019s studio.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"800\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Concrete floors, walls, ceilings, stairs, paving and a strong rhythm of concrete beams\u2019: 6a Architects\u2019 \u2018apparently simple\u2019 design for Juergen Teller\u2019s studio.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Johan Dehlin</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The role of architecture in inflaming Teller\u2019s feverish imagination is subtle. 6a planned the building as an apparently simple enfilade of three roughly cubic blocks interspersed with two square-ish courtyards planted with the help of the garden designer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/danpearson\">Dan Pearson</a>, laid out in a row on a long, narrow site. Walls are sometimes glass to allow space to flow from inside to outside, sometimes opaque. There are double-height spaces and mezzanines to house such things as offices for Teller\u2019s team, a kitchen and dining table where staff and visitors can be convivial together, a secluded room for thinking and yoga.</p> <p>The material is wherever possible concrete: concrete floors, walls, ceilings, stairs, paving and a strong rhythm of concrete beams that hold apart the party walls with the two neighbouring properties. There are touches of brass and ceramic, some decorative floor tiles Teller found in Beirut and surprisingly old-fashioned taps. Emerson borrows a phrase from another member of his practice to describe these: they\u2019re \u201cthe \u2018whiskers on the dragon\u2019, that thing that gives the whole building character, and makes it angry or serene or whatever\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"5ab5cbc65ce6ab3105b99ceea83af54e45361342\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5ab5cbc65ce6ab3105b99ceea83af54e45361342/0_0_3840_5760/667.jpg\" alt=\"The baby on the plate is Ed Teller, Juergen\u2019s son.\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The baby on the plate is Ed Teller, Juergen\u2019s son.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Juergen Teller</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>To make almost all the building out of a single substance gives it the quality of a body. Somewhat in the way that parts as different as fingers, ears or stomach are unified through all being flesh, the concrete can change itself from something massive and earthbound to precise beams overhead, to forming treads and balustrades that you touch with your feet or hands. It can be rough, marked with the boards of its moulds, or smooth. In the courtyards a thin concrete layer was selectively smashed, so that plants can grow through the cracks. Where ventilation is needed it is perforated with cruciform patterns of holes. In places there are graffiti-like stains, accidentally caused by cleaning, that \u201creally upset\u201d Teller, \u201cbut now I like them\u201d.</p> <p>Hard and grey as it is, the concrete could be monotonous, but here it serves as a medium for revealing variety. Apart from the range of its own surfaces, it catches different kinds of light, blue-ish from one direction and gold-ish from another, that changes with the time of day and the seasons. Some incidents from the site\u2019s former lives are allowed to stay, the vegetation from neighbour\u2019s gardens that engulfs a party wall and, a bit like a bit of colonnade in a Roman desert city, a fragment of concrete frame.</p> <p>It also serves the workplace\u2019s multiple moods, which during a shoot can have the frenzy of a baroque court, with 40 or 50 people pursuing their trades in makeup, hair, lighting, props and whatever, plus models or actors and their entourages, plus whatever livestock Teller might want to introduce. At other times it is monastic, a place of quiet work. The building has a semi-public aspect and a very private one, as the front facade tells you. Generally mute, it suggests through unusual aspects of its scale and detail an exceptional universe beyond. It is flat, but when the front door opens, a deep vista is revealed, through layers of glass and courtyards, 60 metres to the back of the site.<br></p> <p>Teller\u2019s images take a frank relish in the specifics of surfaces, in the half-repulsive glisten on a piece of seafood, in mottled skin, body hair, the granularity of dirt, talcum on the nappy zone of his baby son.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b9d7661099035b312815483d6a5a84cc3ccb3b8d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b9d7661099035b312815483d6a5a84cc3ccb3b8d/0_0_5760_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Charlotte Rampling with fox.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Charlotte Rampling with fox.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Juergen Teller</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>6a have a comparable but gentler fascination with the tactility of building materials. Teller combines an openness to chance with a will to be exacting when it matters. As I know from having commissioned 6a myself, for a domestic extension that is all wood rather than Teller\u2019s all concrete, so do they. In Teller\u2019s building, for example, they took care to match the width of the board marks on the concrete with that of the actual timber of the doors. They set up barely noticeable echoes, as with a certain splayed shape that appears as a brass door-pull, a concrete hood over the place where the charger for an electric car is placed, and the housing for roller shutters.</p> <p>So the building and its uses are complementary and unfold over time. It deals nicely with architecture\u2019s generative paradox, which is that it is about creating a fixed and stable object that also, as both a construction site and an inhabited place, is in constant flux. It shows how architecture works as a background to life, without being inert and boring. \u201cI use this place in a very inspiring way,\u201d as Teller puts it, \u201cand wherever I go it looks fresh to me. I shoot anywhere. I like it that I can do a lot of things here and make them totally new.\u201d</p> <p>No donkeys were harmed in the writing of this article.</p>",

  "<p>Essex-born comedian, actor and writer Alan Davies, 50, performed his first standup gig five months after leaving university in 1988, and just three years later was named best young comic by <em>Time Out</em>. Having made the move into television, he is now best known for his role as amateur sleuth Jonathan Creek in BBC1\u2019s Bafta-winning series of the same name, and as a panellist on the quiz show <em>QI</em>. His partner is the children\u2019s author Katie Davies, whom he met backstage at <em>QI</em> and married in 2007 with his friend Bill Bailey as best man. They live in London with their two children. He is currently appearing alongside Jo Brand in Channel 4\u2019s social worker sitcom <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/social-care-network/2016/sep/23/damned-jo-brands-new-sitcom-finds-the-humour-in-social-work\"><em>Damned</em></a>, on Tuesdays at 10pm.</p> <h2>1 | Play</h2> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.thestage.co.uk/reviews/2016/how-not-to-live-in-suburbia-review-at-summerhall-edinburgh/\">How (Not) to Live in Suburbia</a></strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"527a06df84229158450d3d9596a68747b8f6aa17\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/527a06df84229158450d3d9596a68747b8f6aa17/0_9_1200_720/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Annie Siddons\u2019s How (Not) to Live in Suburbia.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Highly recommended\u2019: Annie Siddons\u2019s How (Not) to Live in Suburbia.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Claire Nolan</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I saw this play by Annie Siddons at the Summerhall in Edinburgh. Siddons was raised in London, then when she moved out to Twickenham her marriage broke up and she found herself there with two small children and no friends. It\u2019s about coping with loneliness, really. To preserve their privacy the children were represented by two olive trees, because they put down shallow roots and need looking after \u2013 that was very funny and clever. It\u2019s a show about parenting as much as anything, and I\u2019ve got two small children of my own.

What he\u2019s done with this book is look at people who have been taken apart on social media; people going about their lives, putting up a tweet and before they know it they\u2019ve gone viral and everything\u2019s ruined for them. Rather than giving ourselves a platform for freedom of expression, we are creating an environment where everybody\u2019s cowering in fear of being pursued by an angry pitchfork cyber-mob. I speak as somebody who was on Twitter for a while and now doesn\u2019t go near it because of the toxicity of much of what\u2019s on there.</p> <h2>3 | Documentary</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY-atTsQnAE\"><strong>Peace Officer</strong></a></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c3f2aba7655911893fe610c1cfe8a6b658d80b40\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c3f2aba7655911893fe610c1cfe8a6b658d80b40/0_0_1422_800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Peace Officer\" width=\"1000\" height=\"563\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Documentary film Peace Officer.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: handout/Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I was touring my standup in New Zealand at the same time as the international film festival, and watched a few films while I was there. I saw this documentary, which follows the founder of Utah\u2019s first Swat unit. He investigates the death of his son-in-law and other shootings related to an increase in violent Swat team raids. He thinks the deaths were unnecessary and presents a compelling case, but also has sympathy with the officers who are putting their lives on the line. I found it very interesting because although it\u2019s not a film motivated by race relations, the victims all happen to be white. When there is much publicity rightly being given to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/06/black-lives-matter-uk-found-vital-social-justice\">Black Lives Matter</a>, it\u2019s an interesting parallel issue.</p> <h2>4 | Restaurant</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.davidbann.com/\"><strong>David Bann, Edinburgh</strong></a></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8f250c9a1b84832cddb13d148a40dfecb03b6ace\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8f250c9a1b84832cddb13d148a40dfecb03b6ace/0_0_5184_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"David Bann chili pancake\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A chili pancake at David Bann.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: thevegancookiefairy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This vegetarian restaurant in Edinburgh is one of my favourites. I don\u2019t eat meat \u2013 I do eat seafood sometimes, but usually because there isn\u2019t a good vegetarian option. Everyone should try veggie food. If you think it\u2019s only for vegetarians you\u2019re making a big mistake. The dishes are always quite surprising, they do some quite clever and inventive things on the menu, but equally they\u2019ll do you some stir fry, noodles and veg. It\u2019s a classy, upmarket kind of place, but entirely unpretentious. I wish there was one on every street corner in the country.</p> <h2>5 | Novel</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2016/aug/31/books-to-give-you-hope-gone-with-the-wind-by-margaret-mitchell\"><strong>Gone With the Wind</strong></a><strong> (Margaret Mitchell, 1936)</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"304c93d315a69b2d133f6552711bafa60bf66c98\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/304c93d315a69b2d133f6552711bafa60bf66c98/0_0_4752_3736/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Clark Gable and Vivien Leigh in Gone With the Wind.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"786\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Clark Gable and Vivien Leigh in Gone With the Wind.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sunset Boulevard/Corbis via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The best novel I\u2019ve read in the past 12 months is <em>Gone With the Wind</em>. The reason I read it is interesting: my mum died when I was six, and on her bedside table was a copy of <em>Gone With the Wind</em>, which was left there by my dad. It was her favourite book. When I was growing up it was thought of as a woman\u2019s book, therefore not of interest to me. It\u2019s written by a woman and the central character is a woman, but it\u2019s about the history of racial tension in the US. I was expecting some elongated Mills &amp; Boon scenario and I found something profoundly interesting about a period of history that I\u2019m quite interested in. It\u2019s a broad, sweeping novel, an epic of Dickensian scale, and I had no idea.</p> <h2>6 | Comedy</h2> <p><a href=\"http://willfranken.com/\"><strong>Will Franken</strong></a></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"151e740dfe3a0df41321afb1ab69092ba69b8a9c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/151e740dfe3a0df41321afb1ab69092ba69b8a9c/0_0_4752_3168/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Will Franken\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Quite sardonic\u2019: Will Franken</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Publicity image</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He was the best comedian I saw at the Edinburgh fringe this year. You can\u2019t really describe it as standup because he does so many different voices, and goes off on so many tangents. It\u2019s quite a sardonic approach. Sometimes you see a comedian who has so much talent and such little recognition, you feel like there\u2019s an imbalance in the world. Some people are so inventive that it makes them almost inaccessible to a wider audience, but I thought he was a brilliant comic.</p> <h2>7 | Venue</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.glasgowfilm.org/theatre\"><strong>Glasgow film theatre</strong></a></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a36ab2fe22b2cbf74370d2775afb9dff0fd2bb8f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a36ab2fe22b2cbf74370d2775afb9dff0fd2bb8f/0_0_5000_3337/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Glasgow film theatre\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018A fantastic place\u2019: Glasgow film theatre.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I\u2019ve just been filming a <em>Jonathan Creek</em> Christmas special based in Glasgow. I didn\u2019t know about the Glasgow film theatre, but I stumbled upon it quite early in my stay and what a fantastic place it is. I saw <em>Born to Be Blue</em>, the Chet Baker biopic, as well as this Danish film, <em>The Commune</em>, which was compelling. At work the director would say, \u201cWhat did you do last night?\u201d I\u2019d say, \u201cI went to the GFT again!\u201d You can sit there with a merlot and watch this amazing film and you\u2019re really comfortable.</p>",
  "<p>Live by the sword, die by the sword. That\u2019s what Vogue.com\u2019s senior editors should be thinking at the moment. Ruefully, if they can do that without exacerbating wrinkles. Last week they were simply going about their business disparaging and belittling people \u2013 just a normal day at the office for those who professionally sit in judgment on what others are wearing \u2013 when they got a nasty shock.</p> <p>Let me explain. Apparently it\u2019s&#xa0;just&#xa0;been Milan fashion week. I&#xa0;was surprised to hear that because&#xa0;it seems to me it\u2019s always London fashion week. Not literally always, but very nearly literally always. It genuinely feels like it\u2019s absolutely always London fashion week this week, last week or next week. Is that the system? That it\u2019s once every three weeks? If so, I suppose that leaves two thirds of the time for it to be Paris fashion week, New York fashion week, Bristol fashion week (for tidy sailors) or Milan fashion week, which is the one it was last week.</p> <p>At the end of Milan fashion week,&#xa0;the staff of Vogue.com wrote&#xa0;<a href=\"http://www.vogue.com/13483417/milan-fashion-week-spring-2017-vogue-editors-chat/\" title=\"\">an article on the internet</a> \u2013 a blog, I suppose you\u2019d call it \u2013 discussing what the week had been like, what everyone had learned and why it absolutely hadn\u2019t been a vacuous jamboree consecrated to the&#xa0;monetisation of narcissism. But the main issues the Vogue.com team had wanted to raise \u2013 the future&#xa0;of trousers, perhaps; how a raspberry sock makes a stylish and practical epaulette warmer; the advent of the thigh-gap storage sporran, a great place for the malnourished to keep cocaine and diet pills \u2013 got rather lost because of the digs they all made at bloggers.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Ageing and mortality must hurt all the more if you\u2019ve made a profession of praising novelty</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Other bloggers, that is, not each&#xa0;other. Not people who get paid to write a blog by a magazine that also has a printed-out version for the dentist\u2019s, but a group who seem to be known variously as bloggers, influencers and street-style stars. The ladies at Vogue.com absolutely hate this group and really&#xa0;let rip at them in a tone of weirdly feverish condescension. <em>Vogue</em>\u2019s creative digital director, Sally&#xa0;Singer, started it, writing in brackets to emphasise her contempt: \u201cNote to bloggers who change head-to-toe, paid-to-wear outfits every hour: Please stop. Find another business. You are heralding the death&#xa0;of style.\u201d</p> <p>Her use of the word \u201cstyle\u201d is illuminating because it reveals weakness. She put \u201cstyle\u201d rather than \u201cfashion\u201d. It suits her haughty tone, of course. While affecting to give those not actually under her control an off-hand instruction (which they will defy), she also seems to be alluding to something more significant, more permanent than the merely trendy. But she isn\u2019t. The sense of something being stylish is subjective and, as such, will never die unless we create a world that contains nothing at all to which anyone at all has a positive aesthetic response. Talk of \u201cthe death of style\u201d is empty rhetoric.</p> <p>\u201cFashion\u201d, on the other hand, means something solid. It refers to objects, usually clothes, manufactured to new, cutting edge and/or popular designs. I never know what\u2019s fashionable but plenty of people always do and, at any given time, some things are and some things aren\u2019t. Sometimes flares or ripped jeans or kipper ties or powdered wigs are in and sometimes&#xa0;they\u2019re out. It\u2019s a matter of fact. The discussion and prediction of such facts is what fashion journalism and <em>Vogue</em> are for.</p> <p>But Sally Singer couldn\u2019t refer to \u201cthe death of fashion\u201d because that sounds wrong: something will always be in fashion. Saying \u201cthe death of fashion\u201d is like saying \u201cthe death of recently\u201d, \u201cthe end of the latest thing\u201d. And the latest thing at the moment is the phenomenon of bloggers, influencers and street-style stars. These people, such as <a href=\"http://www.theblondesalad.com/\" title=\"\">Chiara Ferragni</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/gallery/2016/feb/20/at-home-with-susie-bubble-lau-in-pictures\" title=\"\">Susie Lau</a> and <a href=\"http://peaceloveshea.com/\" title=\"\">Shea Marie</a>, whose names mean nothing to me, have huge online followings, can create and redirect trends, and make a lot of money doing it. Essentially they have the same business model as <em>Vogue</em>.</p> <p>These bloggers are, by definition, fashionable, even if Sally Singer and her colleagues don\u2019t consider them stylish. So, note to Vogue.com: never mind style \u2013 that\u2019s not what you\u2019re paid to care about. If what you find stylish is not fashionable, then neither are you.</p> <p>Now, I would say that being fashionable doesn\u2019t matter. But the&#xa0;staff of Vogue.com can\u2019t say that.&#xa0;Their entire raison d\u2019\u00eatre has been to elevate and celebrate the value of being in touch with, and responding to, the latest trends. They&#xa0;can\u2019t suddenly go off all that when it gets a bit youthful and digital&#xa0;and scary. That\u2019s the top of a slippery slope that leads down to comfortable shoes.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"76bc8a6b94a0569054a222d6d37d284c04dc9519\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/76bc8a6b94a0569054a222d6d37d284c04dc9519/0_0_1884_1399/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Illustration by David Foldvari.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"743\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Illustration by David Foldvari.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: David Foldvari</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Of course they weren\u2019t trying to say that fashion doesn\u2019t matter \u2013 they were trying to be the arbiters of fashion, which I suppose has historically been the <em>Vogue</em> journalist\u2019s role. It was an attempt to assert authority. Sarah Mower, Vogue.com\u2019s chief critic, called the bloggers \u201cpathetic\u201d and \u201cdesperate\u201d; Alessandra Codinha, its fashion news editor, said they were \u201cpretty&#xa0;embarrassing\u201d and that going&#xa0;to bloggers for style was \u201clike going to a strip club looking for romance\u201d; and Nicole Phelps, the director of the Vogue Runway app, called them \u201csad\u201d and said \u201cit\u2019s distressing, as well, to watch so many brands participate\u201d.</p> <p>That last remark is a bit of a giveaway. That does sound pretty distressing. If you\u2019re looking to sell&#xa0;advertising spots in <em>Vogue</em>, I imagine it has a positively tragic quality. Phelps\u2019s implication that these brands had somehow let themselves&#xa0;down by associating with&#xa0;bloggers is a hopeless attempt to assert her dated view of the dignity of haute couture above the dictates of commerce.</p> <p>Essentially, the Voguesters\u2019 bid to make the new girls feel small didn\u2019t work. It didn\u2019t make the bloggers seem gauche, it made the old school journalists seem out of touch \u2013 not something the fashion world readily forgives. As \u201cfashion influencer\u201d Shea Marie put it: \u201cYou are exactly the type of people that have given the fashion world the cold, unwelcoming and ruthless reputation it has had in the past.\u201d And the really hurtful word there is \u201cpast\u201d. It falls to others, bloggers probably, to give it the cold, unwelcoming and ruthless reputation I expect it will continue to have in the future.</p> <p>Old bullies make way for new. But ageing and mortality must hurt all the more if you\u2019ve made a profession of praising novelty. When Sally Singer lashed out at the bloggers, talking desperately about \u201cthe death of style\u201d, she must have been terrified. Because, ultimately, that\u2019s not the death they herald.</p>",
  "<h2>1 Improved touch controls</h2> <p>Several buttons now have \u201c3D touch\u201d: they respond to the force used (iPhone 6S or newer devices). A hard press on the timer icon pops up shortcuts to common timer lengths, while the torch icon lets you choose brightness and the camera icon lets you jump to video or selfie mode. Several apps have also gained new touch gestures: in Photos, you can now tap and drag to select multiple images, while the email app now lets you swipe down while composing a message to save it as a draft. To return to a saved draft, hold your finger down on the compose button.</p> <h2>2 Better Apple maps</h2> <p>Apple\u2019s map application is getting smarter \u2013 it knows when you\u2019re driving and in iOS 10 it automatically drops a pin whenever you leave your vehicle, so you can easily find your way back, even in an unfamiliar neighbourhood. On a smaller scale, the Find my iPhone app can now help you locate a mislaid Apple Watch. You can make it play a loud sound to reveal its location \u2013 or put it into \u201clost mode\u201d, which displays a message of your choosing, so that anyone who finds it can get hold of you. If you fear it has gone for good, you can remotely lock or wipe it.</p> <h2>3 Voice notification of important calls</h2> <p>When a call comes in, Siri, Apple\u2019s speech-recognition assistant, can now announce who\u2019s calling, so you know right away whether to pick up. You can enable this at Settings &gt; Phone &gt; Announce Calls. In the interests of privacy, you can choose to use this feature only when using Bluetooth (wireless) headphones or speakers, rather than having all callers\u2019 names read out. You can also now specify individual callers who should always get through, even if your phone\u2019s in \u201cdo not disturb\u201d mode (previously you could do this only for groups of contacts). To set this up, open a contact and select Edit &gt; Ringtone or Edit &gt; Text tone, then turn on the Emergency Bypass switch.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"abf89956e1289cf739a759e9bf92420fc3bc0f2f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/abf89956e1289cf739a759e9bf92420fc3bc0f2f/23_7_642_1296/495.jpg\" alt=\"iOS 10\u2019s Photos app now groups pictures into people and places.\" width=\"495\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">iOS 10\u2019s Photos app now groups pictures into people and places.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Apple</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>4 Find people and places in the photo app</h2> <p>Open Photos and you\u2019ll see new folders entitled \u201cpeople\u201d and \u201cplaces\u201d, grouping pictures according to who is in them and where they were taken. The process of identifying faces is automatic and it happens on your phone (rather than in the cloud) to protect your privacy. To make the most of it, however, you\u2019ll need to tell your iPhone who the people it\u2019s detected are \u2013 simply tap on a picture and start entering names to identify your subjects. With this done you can also search for images by person. You can also identify everyday objects: try a search for \u201ccar\u201d or \u201ctree\u201d, for example.</p> <h2>5 Inline video in the web browser</h2> <p>Before, the Safari web browser for iOS would open videos embedded into web pages in a full-screen view. Now you can watch them in their proper context on the page, just as you would on the desktop. Simply tap to start the video, then tap the resize icon in the bottom-right of the frame (or pinch your fingers together to zoom out). On the iPad Pro, iPad Air 2 or iPad Mini 4, you can also now view two websites side by side: to enable this feature, hold down the new tab button at the top right of the window and you\u2019ll see the option to \u201copen split view\u201d.</p> <h2>6 New Siri features</h2> <p>Siri has a few new tricks in iOS 10. \u201cTake a selfie\u201d is one: Siri won\u2019t actually activate the shutter, but he \u2013 or she if you\u2019ve chosen the female voice \u2013 will open the camera app in selfie mode, ready for your close-up. Siri can also now be used to control third-party apps, such as WhatsApp. To enable this feature, go to Settings &gt; Siri &gt; App Support and enable WhatsApp: you\u2019ll now be able to tell Siri to make calls and send messages. Uber is there too, so Siri can book you a car, and other apps are likely to add support in the near future.</p> <h2>7 iMessage gets a major upgrade</h2> <p>iMessage is loaded with new features. There\u2019s a shortcut directly to the camera, so you can easily send photos and selfies, and if you hold down the send button you\u2019ll see a variety of new visual effects: you can send a birthday message surrounded by balloons or a private chat in \u201cinvisible ink\u201d that\u2019s only visible when the recipient swipes over it with a finger. If that\u2019s not enough, iMessage now has its own app store, selling sticker packs, games and tools for finding and sharing online information. Just open iMessage and tap the new app store icon next to the message box.</p> <h2>8 Redesigned notifications</h2> <p>On the iPhone 6S or newer devices, iOS 10 automatically wakes up the screen to show your notifications as soon as you pick up the phone. What\u2019s more, notifications have become interactive: a hard press lets you reply to an incoming message without having to unlock the phone and open the app. If you\u2019re worried that this feature might be open to abuse, you can disable it by going to Settings &gt; Touch ID &amp; Passcode and turning off \u201cReply with Message\u201d. You can also dismiss all notifications with a hard press on the close icon; on devices without 3D touch, swipe left on the notification for options.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"294b61c3e9ec26cf7438d90fb9dbc3c7315f2bb3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/294b61c3e9ec26cf7438d90fb9dbc3c7315f2bb3/150_160_905_1802/502.jpg\" alt=\"The Messages app has been redesigned to offer more expression options with the iOS 10 software update.\" width=\"502\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Messages app has been redesigned to offer more expression options with the iOS 10 software update.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>9 New calendar app features<br></h2> <p>If your phone supports 3D touch, you don\u2019t have to open the calendar app to see what\u2019s coming up: a hard press on its icon will show you your next appointment. Inside the app, you might notice some events that you don\u2019t recall adding; iOS 10 now automatically schedules events detailed in incoming emails or messages. If this results in a deluge of irrelevant events clogging up your calendar, you can turn it off at Settings &gt; Calendar &gt; Events Found in Apps. A final change to the calendar is simple but welcome: you can now reschedule events by simply tapping and dragging them to a new time.</p> <h2>10 Smarter typing suggestions<br></h2> <p>Apple\u2019s QuickType keyboard, introduced in iOS 8, suggests words based on what it thinks you\u2019re typing; iOS 10 goes a step further by analysing the message you\u2019re replying to and suggesting likely responses. If someone sends you an iMessage asking you for a friend\u2019s email address, for example, you\u2019ll see contact details pop up as a suggested response. Another subtle upgrade to the keyboard is the ability to recognise multiple languages without your having to switch them manually \u2013 so if you\u2019re trying to impress a colleague with your savoir faire, your iPhone won\u2019t keep trying to \u201ccorrect\u201d your bons mots.</p> <h2>11 Ways to clear out the clutter<br></h2> <p>It\u2019s frustrating to have your phone cluttered up with apps you don\u2019t need, such as Stocks or the one for the Apple Watch. At last, iOS 10 lets you remove these. Sadly, not much memory space is actually saved \u2013 most of the underlying code is built into iOS itself, so removing optional apps only clears around 150MB \u2013 but it keeps your home screen much tidier. You can also save a few gigabytes with the iPhone\u2019s \u201coptimise storage\u201d feature, which in iOS 10 can now scan your music library and clear out locally stored tracks that you haven\u2019t listened to for a while.</p> <h2>12 Better connections between devices</h2> <p>\u201cContinuity\u201d is Apple\u2019s way of allowing you to put down your work on one device and pick it up on another. iOS 10 adds cross-device clipboard support, so if you want to copy an iMessage into a Word document on your desktop, you can simply hit copy on one device and paste on the other, as long as your Mac is running the latest <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/macos/sierra/\" title=\"\">macOS Sierra</a> release. If you own an Apple TV, you\u2019ll also be pleased to learn that, with the latest version of tvOS, you can now seamlessly switch to your iPhone to enter text \u2013 handy for fiddly searches.</p>",
  "<p>In 2010, <a href=\"http://sarahglidden.com/\">Sarah Glidden</a>, a young American cartoonist, went on a two-month, Kickstarter-funded trip to Turkey, Iraq and Syria with two friends from a nonprofit journalism collective called the <a href=\"http://www.seattleglobalist.com/\">Seattle Globalist</a>. The idea was that she would watch and listen as they reported on the ground: her next book, she hoped, would look at how such journalism works in a world in which many big media organisations, under threat both from free content elsewhere and the rapid disappearance of advertising revenue, find themselves increasingly reluctant to pay for expensive-to-produce foreign news.</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t an easy trip, but nor was it as difficult as people had told her it would be (one Israeli friend insisted that, as a Jewish woman, there was simply no way she should venture into the \u201caxis of evil\u201d). The civil war in Syria had not yet begun and Damascus was then still safe and welcoming; in Sulaymaniyah, the city in northern Kurdish Iraq where she spent several weeks, her gleaming new hotel was full of tourists, even if they were mostly seeking respite from the fighting further south. Even so, every day brought a new challenge. Contacts had to be made overnight, rather than gathered slowly over a period of months, and government minders, at least in Syria, had to be fought off. Even as her friends hunted down compelling stories \u2013 here was a group of refugees living in one of Saddam\u2019s former prisons; there was a supposedly innocent man who\u2019d been deported from America after his name appeared in the 9/11 commission report \u2013 they always had to keep one eye pragmatically, even ruthlessly, on what might go down well at home.</p> <p>Were they to end up not selling any stories at all, their trip would be little more than an expensive waste of time. Meanwhile, there was the issue of Dan O\u2019Brien, the Iraq veteran (and now university student) they\u2019d invited to come with them. The Globalist journalists, Sarah Stuteville and Alex Stonehill, hoped to make his return the subject of a feature. But would he ever open up about what it felt like to meet some of those on whose behalf he had supposedly fought and whose lives had since been so painfully disrupted? As the days ticked by, they feared he would not.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"45f556af302ce7e77f0d89c33e73ec4bdd743d02\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/45f556af302ce7e77f0d89c33e73ec4bdd743d02/142_132_3347_4716/710.jpg\" alt=\"An extract from Sarah Glidden\u2019s Rolling Blackouts\" width=\"710\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An extract from Sarah Glidden\u2019s Rolling Blackouts: \u2018about as serious and careful as a comic can possibly be\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sarah Glidden/Drawn &amp; Quarterly</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Six years later, these things, not to mention her own thoughts and feelings about them, form the intricate narrative of Glidden\u2019s provocative new comic book. Part memoir, part ethical inquiry and part travelogue, <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/rolling-blackouts.html\"><em>Rolling Blackouts</em></a> resembles the work of her great hero, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/joe-sacco\">Joe Sacco</a>, the author of <em>Palestine</em> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/aug/11/history.comics\"><em>Safe Area Gora\u017ede</em></a>, at least in the sense that it is about as serious and careful as a comic can possibly be. But it also has a gentleness that is all its own, perhaps because Glidden works mostly in soft watercolour, a medium that seems somehow to reflect her refusal to deal in certainties. Stories, as she writes in her introduction to <em>Rolling Blackouts</em>, are \u201chow we make sense of a chaotic world\u201d and she wants those she tells to be gripping; clearly, her material has to be edited, refined. But that doesn\u2019t mean that she isn\u2019t aware of her responsibilities or that they don\u2019t weigh heavily with her. Just as a person\u2019s life is much more to them than a mere story, so true objectivity is all but impossible in narrative journalism.</p> <p>Comics are hugely labour intensive compared with many other forms of reporting and, yes, a tiny part of her worries that while she was busy drawing <em>Rolling Blackouts</em>, things changed almost beyond recognition in two of the three countries it depicts. But in the end, she also feels her book was built to last.</p> <p>\u201cI think it stands up in its own right,\u201d she says, down the line from her home in Seattle. \u201cIt is very focused on refugees: on how difficult it is to get resettled, on how only 1% of them make it to a third country. So I hope people will be able to extrapolate, to think: well, if it was this way for Iraqis in Damascus who were registered with the UNHCR [United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees] and going through all the right official channels, think how much more difficult it must be for the Syrians now, when the centres are overflowing and the numbers are so vast. But in any case, it\u2019s still important to understand what the impact of the Iraq war has been. It\u2019s too easy to move past Iraq and Afghanistan and focus only on Syria. Those people [the Iraqis] are still displaced and still in danger. The fact that the news cycle has moved on doesn\u2019t make their stories any less important.\u201d</p> <p>Can comics take the reader to places other forms of journalism can\u2019t? She believes they can. \u201cThere are drawbacks, one of them being issues of timeliness. But work like mine tries to make a connection between the reader and the person being interviewed by showing things like their body language, where they live and what they wear. It\u2019s about these slower moments, in which you reveal who they are as people. Text can provide more information, but perhaps it puts more distance in there, too, and we\u2019re bombarded by horrific photographs to the point where we\u2019re desensitised. Drawings have a more human touch.\u201d She tends to keep violent images out of her strips; sometimes, listening to a person looking back and telling their story in their own words is more powerful even than blood and rubble.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"258472b9b6c97f2fe5a5ffa1feba10dcab80ce4a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/258472b9b6c97f2fe5a5ffa1feba10dcab80ce4a/161_123_3324_4713/705.jpg\" alt=\"An extract from the \u2018provocative\u2019 Rolling Blackouts\" width=\"705\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Glidden, the daughter of two doctors, studied painting at Boston University. \u201cBut then 9/11 happened. I was only 21 and I started to be interested in journalism. My reaction to it, besides feeling a sense of horror, was that if a war was going to happen immediately, there must be more to the story than I knew. So I started reading everything. I was drawn to photojournalism. I think I wanted to be <a href=\"http://www.worldpressphoto.org/people/tyler-hicks\">Tyler Hicks</a> [the Pulitzer prize-winning <em>New York Times</em> staff photographer], but I was also very shy. I didn\u2019t have what it took to talk to people and take those kinds of pictures and nor did I have any training.\u201d</p> <p>After college, she \u201cblundered around\u201d, wondering what she might do with her art, until she discovered graphic novels, at which point something clicked. \u201cI read <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/oct/18/fiction.art\"><em>Maus</em></a> [by Art Spiegelman] and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/gallery/2011/oct/30/ten-best-graphic-novels-in-pictures\"><em>Persepolis</em></a> [by Marjane Satrapi] and they were formative. All my life, I\u2019d known comics from <em>Mad</em> magazine or the newspapers; I hadn\u2019t realised they could be used to tell true, serious stories. I didn\u2019t have a father who survived the Holocaust [like Spiegelman] and I hadn\u2019t spent my childhood in Iran [like Satrapi], but I started experimenting with autobiographical comics and from there I began trying to think of a bigger project I could do. That\u2019s why I went on a <a href=\"https://www.birthrightisrael.com/countries\">Birthright Israel </a>trip.\u201d</p> <p>Being of a liberal persuasion, she knew she would find this experience challenging (Birthright Israel sponsors free trips to the country for young people of Jewish heritage) and that this sense of conflict would perhaps enable her to turn her travels into a long-form comic. And that\u2019s exactly what happened. She drew a couple of chapters \u2013 she was then paying her bills by working at a set production company \u2013 and when an editor from the comics imprint Vertigo saw them, she was offered an advance to complete it. The result was the award-winning <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/how-to-understand-israel-in-60-days-or-less.html\"><em>How to Understand Israel in 60 Days or Less</em></a>.</p> <p>Was this brilliantly precise and sometimes withering book controversial in the US? \u201cOh, I got a few hate mails,\u201d she says with a laugh. \u201cOne told me I should mind my own business and go back to my loser life. There are some people for whom any criticism of Israel is an offence; do that and you\u2019re a self-hating Jew. But actually, I was surprised. I thought there would be more and some of my biggest support came from the Jewish Reform community. I was more amazed by the push back I got from the left, who were indignant I hadn\u2019t gone to the West Bank.\u201d This was a little unfair, given that she makes no secret in the book of her frustration that she failed to visit the occupied territories. \u201cIt was a major regret, which is why I included it. I listened to the things people were telling me about how I would be in danger and I gave into fear. But you know, part of what I like about the book is that it is about confusion. It\u2019s a document of me at that time.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"052813879adca658090b284219ade7add98da8d5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/052813879adca658090b284219ade7add98da8d5/142_118_3350_4724/709.jpg\" alt=\"An extract from the \u2018provocative\u2019 Rolling Blackouts\" width=\"709\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Writing <em>How to Understand Israel</em> taught her many things, not least to check her recording equipment before leaving home. \u201cAnd I should have asked questions of people who weren\u2019t part of our scheduled trip \u2013 the Palestinians who worked in the cafes where we stayed, for instance. I could have just talked to them.\u201d</p> <p>What about her drawing and writing? \u201cI learned to give space to things, to reduce the amount of text. You need to give the reader a break from information; you need to pace things in the right way.\u201d But if her comics have a domestic, even quotidian quality, this is deliberate: \u201cOnce you\u2019re in a place, you see how similar it is to the world you know and I want to show that. The same lawn chairs that we have in America are all over the Middle East; the Chinese restaurant we ate in [in Sulaymaniyah] had exactly the same dumplings as at home.\u201d</p> <p>Her next project, she thinks, will be closer to home. \u201cThere\u2019s stuff going on here I\u2019d like to cover. I\u2019m so upset by the misconceptions people have about refugees, especially those coming to the US. We have Trump and equally dangerous politicians saying: we don\u2019t know who these people are, they\u2019re not vetted, they\u2019re terrorists. In fact, the opposite is true: they go through two years of interviews with different agencies.\u201d</p> <p>Does it make her happy that comics such as hers are now taken seriously, the subject of glowing reviews in <em>Newsweek</em> and the <em>New York Times</em>? \u201cYes and we\u2019ve come so far even in the last five years. There are so many comics for young people now \u2013 people like Raina Telgemeier [author of the bestselling <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/sisters-9.html\"><em>Sisters</em></a>] have just exploded \u2013 which means they\u2019re going to grow up knowing about comics in a way that my generation didn\u2019t. But there\u2019s still a long way to go. It\u2019s easy to be in a bubble, to forget that most people haven\u2019t read any serious comics, that they see the word \u2018comic\u2019 and think: oh, funny. We need a new word.\u201d She thinks for a moment. She doesn\u2019t write graphic novels, but even if she did, the term wouldn\u2019t quite fit: \u201cMy mum says that sounds like something very violent. She thinks they should be called narratoons \u2013 and you know, maybe one day, they will be.\u201d</p> <p><em>Rolling Blackouts: Dispatches From Turkey, Syria and Iraq is published by Drawn &amp; Quarterly (\u00a316.99). </em><a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/rolling-blackouts.html\"><em>Click here to buy it for \u00a313.93</em></a></p>",

  "<p>Back in 1965, a young, enigmatic Bob Dylan was filmed touring Britain in what many regard as the greatest rock tour movie of all time. Now, more than 50 years after <em>Dont Look Back</em> (sic) caught the early stages of a famous career \u2013 and the dying embers of the singer\u2019s personal relationship with Joan Baez \u2013 one of Britain\u2019s most renowned film-makers is offering his own take on a major UK tour.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/michael-winterbottom\">Michael Winterbottom</a>, director of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2010/jul/25/steve-coogan-rob-brydon-restaurant\"><em>The Trip</em></a>, <em>24 Hour Party People</em> and <em>Welcome to Sarajevo</em>, has been inspired to create an up-to-date chronicle of life lived from gig to gig. His new film, <em>On The Road</em>, looks close-up at the life led by members of London four-piece band Wolf Alice, their crew and entourage. Already a big name in British rock, the young band is now braced for public reaction to the film\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/news-opinion/news-bfi/announcements/world-premiere-michael-winterbottom-s-road-added-bfi-london-film\">premiere at the London Film Festival</a> on 9 October.</p> <p>\u201cI watched <em>Dont Look Back</em> again before I started making this,\u201d said Winterbottom. \u201cI like the way it doesn\u2019t appear to be trying to tell you anything, but you pick up a real picture of the people and of the world they are in. What I have made is kind of simple \u2013 just saying this is what happens on the road.\u201d</p> <p>The new film follows the four Brit award-winning musicians, who played on the main stage at Glastonbury this year, on their recent British tour \u2013 tracking them on and off stage and focusing on the work of the crew and support team who keep the show moving.</p> <p>\u201cThey are a very hardworking band and I hope that comes across. The team around them have to be hardworking too, with all the routine and repetition. It is a kind of music I like and Wolf Alice are great live,\u201d Winterbottom said.</p> <p>The 55-year-old director was speaking from Spain, where he is finishing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/feb/15/the-trip-heads-to-spain-steve-coogan-rob-brydon\">a new series of <em>The Trip</em></a>, the acclaimed TV comedy in which Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon pretend to be reviewing restaurants for this newspaper.</p> <p>Winterbottom was drawn to filming Wolf Alice, he said, partly because of a series of small coincidences, such as the fact that the band took its name from an Angela Carter short story; Winterbottom\u2019s first job was working as a researcher for the writer. \u201cOne of the other attractions was certainly that they are a young band. It must be amazing for them writing songs and then seeing thousands of peopling loving them that night,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd for us it was much better to show the realities of life on the road with a documentary approach rather than a fictionalised one.</p> <p>\u201cThere is stage performance, of course, but there is normal backstage stuff, like lying in bed or having a shower backstage, meeting friends in the crew or falling in love . We wanted to find a way to show all of it. It is a romantic life, but it can be horrific, too, doing the same thing all the time.\u201d</p> <p>The band \u2013 Ellie Rowsell, Joff Oddie, Joel Amey and Theo Ellis \u2013 played the final night of the tour on Saturday night at Margate. Guitarist and frontwoman Rowsell says she does not know what to expect from the added exposure of the film.</p> <p>\u201cI have no idea what it will do,\u201d the 24-year-old said. \u201cWe agreed because we are open to new experiences and we have never worked with actors and producers before. I hope we don\u2019t come across as annoying, or bad and stupid. But I suppose anyone in the public eye should have these anxieties really.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"36e1c74a0036ee8fdae5be50a2c0451a8228ed96\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/36e1c74a0036ee8fdae5be50a2c0451a8228ed96/49_70_2816_1689/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bob Dylan in a still from DA Pennebaker\u2019s classic 1967 documentary Dont Look Back.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bob Dylan in a still from DA Pennebaker\u2019s classic 1967 documentary Dont Look Back.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Granamour Weems Collection / Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Just like some of Winterbottom\u2019s previous hits, including his 2005 film A Cock And Bull Story, On the Road is not all it appears to be. There is a deliberately shifting grip on documentary fact, but it provides an accurate picture of the pressures on young band members and how they cope with the cliches of life in and out of a tour bus.</p> <p>The film, which is a documentary but uses some creative licence, is far from being a lurid chronicle of bohemian misbehaviour. No longer are TVs thrown out of hotel windows, cars driven into swimming pools or drugs taken to such excess, according to Stephen Taverner, the band\u2019s manager.</p> <p>\u201cMichael just jumped on our tour really, wanting to capture that sense of young people having a great time, but I would say things have definitely calmed down from the 80s. He has since said he got the idea for a film about a tour after meeting [1990s band] Ash in New York and hearing a lot of their stories of excess. He had not mentioned that to me. I managed that band!\u201d</p> <p>During his career Taverner said he has watched younger musicians being \u201ca little bit more sensible and realising they can have a career if they play it right\u201d. \u201cThey don\u2019t feel behaving like that is a rite of passage any more,\u201d he added.</p> <p>Rowsell said she found the camera no trouble most of the time. \u201cMichael kept out of the way as it was a fly-on-the-wall style,\u201d she said. \u201cWe went about our normal day, so it was quite easy. Because there is a narrative, there were maybe a couple of slightly staged or repeated moments, and when you are not used to the filming process and are told to \u2018be normal\u2019, you forget what your response might usually be.\u201d</p> <p>The joy of being on tour is genuine, she said. \u201cI really like it. I see new places \u2013 and I love performing in front of a crowd. But we provide the surroundings for the film: although they spent a hefty amount of time with us, we are not the biggest characters.\u201d</p> <p>The band started as a folk duo, with Rowsell and Oddie finding the other band members four years ago. They released their official debut single, Fluffy, in February 2013, and another, Bros, followed three months later. A debut album, My Love Is Cool, came out last year and their single, Moaning Lisa Smile, was nominated for a Grammy Award for best rock performance this year.</p> <p>\u201cWhen Michael came to us with the idea of the film, I, and some of the others, were a bit paranoid about the potential Spinal Tap element to it all,\u201d said Taverner, referring to the spoof rockumentary. \u201cBut he was very understanding about that concern and gave us some control.\u201d</p> <p>The band were fans of 24 Hour Party People, Winterbottom\u2019s 2002 film about Tony Wilson and Manchester\u2019s Factory Records music boom in 1976, and the director\u2019s controversial and explicit hit 9 Songs was also admired.</p> <p>Rowsell, who first tried writing stories and poetry before picking up a guitar at 14, is preparing to start working on a new album. \u201cWe will be writing again in our houses, on our own, sometimes together. We are now looking for another space we can use,\u201d she said.</p> <p>For Winterbottom, Rowsell was the perfect frontwoman. \u201cEllie is a great role model for the girls in the audience, you can see that. She is very charismatic and it is nice to see that in the kind of band that might have had mainly male fans.\u201d</p> <ul> <li>This article was amended on 2 October to correct the spelling of Stephen Taverner\u2019s name</li> </ul>",
  "<p>Amma Asante is drinking tea \u2013 \u201cIf you have PG Tips, all the better,\u201d she calls to the retreating waiter \u2013 in the plush quietness and gleaming surfaces of London\u2019s Cafe Royal. Despite traffic jams and torrential rain, she is impeccably calm, certainly calmer than many film-makers would be had their latest production been selected to open this year\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jun/21/a-united-kingdom-london-film-festival-david-oyelowo-amma-asante\">London film festival</a>. But Asante, whose previous films <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2004/nov/08/hayfilmfestival2005.race\"><em>A Way of Life </em></a>and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jun/15/belle-review-costume-drama-teeth-slavery\"><em>Belle</em></a><em> </em>garnered her high praise and multiple awards, including a Bafta, is clearly a star in the making \u2013 and possibly also a star-maker; Gugu Mbatha-Raw, whom she cast in her breakthrough part as the title character in <em>Belle</em>, has just appeared opposite Matthew McConaughey in the American civil war drama <em>Free State of Jones</em>. Earlier this year Asante was also invited to become a member of the US Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, which has had its biggest ever intake of new members following intense criticism over the lack of racial diversity in Oscar nominees. In joining a Hollywood club with a decades-long reputation for being largely white, male and aged over 50, she\u2019ll now have voting rights on the Oscars, and a part to play in steering the industry and what comes to our screens in the future.</p> <p>For the moment, though, she\u2019s concentrating on <em>A United Kingdom</em>, which had an unexpected \u2013 and even inconvenient \u2013 genesis. About 18 months ago, Asante was about to move not only home but also country, quitting the Netherlands, where she had lived for eight years, in favour of Denmark, where her husband is from. Amid all the upheaval and readjustment the phone rang. At the other end was actor David Oyelowo, whom Asante had known since they worked together on the BBC drama <em>Brothers and Sisters </em>back in 1998. Oyelowo, fresh from playing Martin Luther King in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/feb/08/selma-observer-film-review\"><em>Selma</em></a>, wanted to persuade her to be part of an idea whose moment had come \u2013 \u201ca labour of love\u201d, as he described it.</p> <p>The project was to film the life of Seretse Khama and Ruth Williams, the first prime minister of Botswana and his wife, an office clerk from Eltham. Their marriage, in 1948, when Botswana was still the British protectorate of Bechuanaland, had immense ramifications, both personal and political: Khama, who had met Williams at a missionary society dance in London, had been supposed to return from his stint at Balliol College, Oxford and subsequent studies for the bar to take up the kingship of the Bamangwato people. He was not supposed to return with a white, English bride, and particularly not just as neighbouring South Africa had made interracial marriage illegal under the apartheid system; her arrival angered both Bamangwato chiefs and many who couldn\u2019t believe that their future leader would choose an outsider above a local. Ruth Williams\u2019s family also opposed the marriage, and there was vehement objection from the British government, enraged by what they saw as a dangerous misstep in managing regional relationships.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2016/aug/25/a-united-kingdom-trailer-interracial-marriage-causes-outrage-in-true-story-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/5x97b\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2683649\"            data-video-name=\"A United Kingdom trailer: interracial marriage causes outrage in true story \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57bedbcfe4b0fe30498a4a41\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/08/25/160825AUnitedKingdom_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/08/25/160825AUnitedKingdom.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/08/25/160825AUnitedKingdom_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2016/aug/25/a-united-kingdom-trailer-interracial-marriage-causes-outrage-in-true-story-video\">A United Kingdom trailer: interracial marriage causes outrage in true story.</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Oyelowo had first come across Susan Williams\u2019s book <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/colour-bar.html\"><em>Colour Bar</em></a>, on which the film is based, in 2010, through producers Justin Moore-Lewy and Charlie Mason, who had acquired the rights. Since then, the three had struggled to get the project, with Oyelowo playing Khama, off the ground. But the story of Khama, Williams and Bechuanaland\u2019s gradual journey towards independence immediately struck a chord with Asante, fresh from her success with the recently released <em>Belle</em>, which also drew on a complex piece of history to explore relationships across racial divides. Her father, she tells me, was a pan-African, a man who believed in a united states of Africa. \u201cHe grew up in Ghana when it was still the Gold Coast; grew up, as my mother did, as the child of a colony, and watched it become independent. And Ghana was the first sub-Saharan country to gain its independence, so we always lived with that badge on our chest; I was always raised knowing that was the country that I came from. I grew up being able to repeat \u2013 at seven or eight years old \u2014 the speeches of Kwame Nkrumah, who became the first president of Ghana.\u201d</p> <p>Consequently, she explains, she was gripped not only by the fierceness and endurance of the romantic relationship at the heart of the story, but also by the intricacy and subtleties of its sociopolitical setting. Reading her way through Williams\u2019s book \u2013 it\u2019s brilliant, she says, but so dense with complex detail that she could only read 18 pages a day \u2013 she realised that she wanted to explore how Khama came to a point where he could contemplate utterly changing the political landscape of his country. \u201cEven though I didn\u2019t know the story,\u201d she remarks, \u201cI was very aware of the young, privileged men of Africa who moved through the UK in the 1940s, who were sent to be educated. I knew it because the women weren\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>What she didn\u2019t want, she explains, was to privilege one aspect of the drama over the other. And neither did she think it was necessary: \u201cYou could create a very political backdrop against the love story. Because, really, what is interesting about being a black man married to a white woman today? Yes, in certain quarters, it\u2019s still difficult and there is still a taboo. But it\u2019s not that interesting \u2013 why pick them, as opposed to any other interracial couple? What\u2019s really interesting is what happened once this couple chose to fall in love, the period in which they fell in love, which was right as South Africa was about to enshrine apartheid into its laws, and the fallout that occurs.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Qx90wdRD2I\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/9Qx90wdRD2I?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Qx90wdRD2I\">The trailer for Belle, Assante\u2019s second film as director.</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>She notes \u2013 while also acknowledging the earlier film\u2019s vital importance at the time \u2013 that <em>A United Kingdom</em> is not a rerun of <em>Guess Who\u2019s Coming to Dinner</em>, the 1967 film in which a black man played by Sidney Poitier courts a white woman, to the consternation of her parents. Rather, she says, she had to find those things in the story that would resonate with contemporary issues. Among those is the issue of transition and identity. One facet of the story she focused on explores the idea that someone might be sent away at a formative age to experience life and education in another country and yet still be expected to return essentially unaltered; it also shows those at home, inching their way towards establishing nationhood in the face of societal change.</p> <p>I tell her that I was struck by the numerous interwoven stories of restriction and emancipation, and the different weight that history accorded them. Near the start of Asante and screenwriter Guy Hibbert\u2019s film, Khama and his wife, played by Oyelowo and Rosamund Pike, return to Bechuanaland and are met with hostility, despite his previous popularity; he determines to address the <em>kgotla</em> \u2013 a public meeting \u2013 and put his case. Scores of Bamangwato men, many of them dressed in suits, walk from their villages to attend, but there is barely a woman to be seen. Asante nods: she dotted a few around the edges, she remembers, as if to suggest that they couldn\u2019t help themselves from coming to listen, but there was a firm message that politics was not for women.</p> <p>And yet she knew that she had to represent the view of Bamangwato women. \u201cWhen I first came to the script, the point of view of the black female wasn\u2019t really there, and it was very important,\u201d she says. \u201cI thought about my mother, I thought about my aunts; my mother was born and raised in a very rural village, but her brother is a chief. And the idea that he should go abroad and return, even with someone of the same colour but who was an outsider, and say, this is going to be your queen, I just imagined what their response would be. And there you have it, in the film.\u201d</p> <p>Asante has had a lifetime of considering the nuances that attach themselves to the questions of identity and power informing her work. Now 47, she reckons that she is in a position to empower two sides of her identity \u2013 her Ghanaian heritage and her British upbringing \u2013 to be in dialogue with one another. \u201cI allow that conversation to happen, and it\u2019s a pleasure,\u201d she explains. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t know what side I\u2019ll come out on each day, or what decision I\u2019ll come out with on each day, but it is a dynamic rather than a conflict.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e2613452f51f0f0245ceb64ca9cb832f80999453\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e2613452f51f0f0245ceb64ca9cb832f80999453/0_45_2362_1417/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rosamund Pike and David Oyelowo in A United Kingdom.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rosamund Pike and David Oyelowo in A United Kingdom.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Is she able to put into words what characterises these different parts of her? She mentions her pride in the traditions of her parents\u2019 Ghanaian background, and of how important it is to her to be able to speak their language. \u201cAnd yet, the very British side of me, who is the child of immigrants, is the side of me that welcomes outsiders \u2013 the modern British side, that is \u2013 and enjoys crossing boundaries and sharing boundaries and being open to what an outsider might bring. But I\u2019m still deeply protective of my traditions at the same time.\u201d (Amusingly, as we both ponder the miniature glass cloche covering the miniature biscuit that has accompanied tea, she puts her mild aversion to elaborate service down to her British \u201cside\u201d.)</p> <p>She grew up in Streatham, which she describes, in the early 1980s and beyond, as \u201ca pretty racist environment\u201d \u2013 complete with graffiti on the walls and lit matches pushed through the letterbox. \u201cThat was just a way of life,\u201d she says now, inadvertently making reference to the title of her first feature film, \u201cbut I was aware of the stress it put my parents through.\u201d Her accountant father\u2019s response was to tell his family that there was one thing they had to remember at all times: \u201cKnow that you are loved.\u201d</p> <p>Fascinatingly, these exact words recur as a line in <em>Belle </em>(2013), the story of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/may/04/dido-belle-slaves-daughter-who-lived-in-georgian-elegance\">Dido Elizabeth Belle</a>, the child of a British admiral and an African slave, who was brought to England by her father and left in the care of her great-uncle, Lord Mansfield; they are the words spoken to her by her father, whom she only knows for a few hours, as he bids her farewell. Even more poignantly, Asante\u2019s father died during the filming of <em>Belle</em>, and she talks movingly about his impact on her work. She will always, she thinks, create benevolent fathers who are also flawed; hers, whom she describes as her hero, \u201cmade mistakes, but when he got it right, he got it really right\u201d.</p> <p>Belle grew up in Kenwood House in Hampstead, surrounded by great material privilege and familial love, but simultaneously excluded from vast swaths of society by the colour of her skin. As in <em>A United Kingdom</em>, there is a love story; but there is also a highly involved narrative that chronicles the changing legal position of slave cargo \u2013 at heart, the degree to which slaves being transported at sea were regarded as human beings rather than mere possessions, to be jettisoned at the drop of a hat. Both elements of the film unite to portray a mixed-race woman growing in self-recognition and self-possession, and balancing the different claims made on her loyalties.</p> <p>Both movies also imply that a key moment in the journey towards selfhood is the acceptance that individuals contain multitudes. As a child, Asante began to act, and joined the cast of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/feb/07/bbc.television1\"><em>Grange Hill</em></a>; she was part of the \u201cJust Say No\u201d campaign, and was one of nine cast members to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/shortcuts/2016/mar/07/grange-hill-nancy-reagan-white-house-just-say-no\">visit Ronald Reagan\u2019s White House</a>. But she would also develop lines to use in her off-screen life; for instance, she always used to reply \u201cGhana\u201d when asked where she was from, because \u201cStreatham\u201d seemed to cause confusion of the \u201cNo, where are you really from?\u201d variety. \u201cSo that became too complex,\u201d she recalls, \u201cand also it was a big fat rejection, because I actually felt as British as anybody else but I would constantly be reminded that I wasn\u2019t. And so it was easier to just say African.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"14bff481e025f0a69d560c0c0091d44e09f3dd36\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/14bff481e025f0a69d560c0c0091d44e09f3dd36/0_183_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Assante\u2019s debut feature, A Way of Life, told a story about racism using white characters.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Assante\u2019s debut feature, A Way of Life, told a story about racism using white characters.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Imagenet</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But things changed somewhat when her debut, <em>A Way of Life</em>, was released. Set in Wales, the film tells the story of a young, single mother fighting extreme disadvantage, and also of her Turkish, Muslim neighbour. It started to get a little attention, and \u201cquite often I would read about myself, and it would be, \u2018young British film-maker\u2019. And when you see words written about you, they\u2019re very powerful.\u201d Did she feel that, in a sense, she was being claimed? Yes, she replies, \u201cbut there was a sense of, well, that\u2019s what I\u2019ve been saying all along, but haven\u2019t been allowed to say. But that\u2019s exactly what I am. I\u2019m a young British director.\u201d</p> <p>We talk more broadly about the issues of migration and the resistance to it that are bedevilling the world at the moment. Asante locates in much of the fear that surrounds the conversation an interesting insight into entitlement. \u201cI often think about what we might look back at in 100 or 200 years\u2019 time from now and see as really\u2026\u201d \u2013 she grasps for the word \u2013 \u201c<em>primitive</em>. Because we fear, we really believe, there isn\u2019t enough to share, and there really isn\u2019t enough to go around, because that\u2019s a narrative that we\u2019re given. But that\u2019s because we\u2019ve decided that certain boundaries should exist and must exist, and you should stay over there, because the world over there is created for you, and the world over here is created for us. Well, that\u2019s never worked.\u201d</p> <p>At the time, she points out, change is always complicated, and when it happens too quickly, can be problematic. \u201cYou can\u2019t have a country of fearful people,\u201d she says, and in <em>A United Kingdom</em>, she is understanding of the competing demands on the Attlee and Churchill governments, both of which adopted problematic stances towards Bechuanaland as they sought to rebuild postwar British society. And yet, as she also says and the film makes clear, there was a good outcome: Seretse Khama took his country towards independence and democratic representation, and there it remains. She has already been criticised, she says, for making too much of a crowd-pleaser, to which she retorts that she can\u2019t change history. But does she think that underlying that attitude is an unfamiliarity, perhaps even tantamount to disbelief, with the business of telling an African success story?</p> <p>She nods vigorously. \u201cThere was an argument over whether we should show some of the more beautiful images that we have in the film of Africa. This is why you need a person of colour at the table. Because I said, why not? That\u2019s the Africa I know. Hundreds of thousands of people travel to Botswana every single year to go and see the animal life there. Why would we pretend that that doesn\u2019t exist? Why wouldn\u2019t we show the beautiful sunsets? I remember waking up in my mother\u2019s African village to beautiful sunrises and beautiful sunsets.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re so used to seeing flies in African children\u2019s faces, we\u2019re so used to seeing what I call a degraded Africa, that does not have a person of colour at the centre of their own story \u2013 they\u2019re usually a supporting character who\u2019s an observer of their own story \u2013 that sometimes I think that when you see it told a different way, which means that you take a character like Rosamund Pike played in Ruth and flip the switch and make her the other, then it makes some people feel uncomfortable. Your expectations are disrupted. And I believe that\u2019s what I\u2019m here for. I hold that flag.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/sep/26/amma-asante-female-directors-a-united-kingdom\">Amma Asante: film industry chiefs 'don't trust female directors'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Asante is full of praise for Pike, who came to film after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/oct/05/gone-girl-review-two-different-readings-modern-marriage\"><em>Gone Girl</em></a>, and immediately embraced the no-makeup, frizzy hair and sensible shoes look that her character adopted when she moved to Botswana (there are rather more swinging skirts with nipped-in waists at the jazz clubs that feature in the film\u2019s London scenes). \u201cTo me, she embodied the courage that I imagined Ruth had,\u201d she says. Particularly impressive was Pike\u2019s insistence that she would simply drop to the ground during a scene in which Williams, suffering from diphtheria, collapses on a dusty road. Asante, worried about the numerous rocks in the path, had had sleepless nights wondering how they could conceal a mattress, but had to content herself with setting the crew to remove as many stones as they could. When one of Khama and Williams\u2019s sons visited the set, he delivered the ultimate imprimatur: \u201cIt\u2019s not every day you see your mother and father come back to life.\u201d</p> <p>Next, Asante is going to tackle the Nazis. <em>Where Hands Touch</em>, which she has written herself, will start filming in October, with <em>The Hunger Games\u2019s</em> Amandla Stenberg and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/sep/11/captain-fantastic-review-viggo-mortensen\"><em>Captain Fantastic\u2019s</em></a><em> </em>George MacKay starring as a teenage couple facing the not inconsiderable obstacle of his membership of the Hitler Youth and the fact that she is a mixed-race girl living in the Third Reich. Once again, issues of identity play an integral part, as does Asante\u2019s abiding interest in capturing social and political structures at the moment where they begin to fall apart.</p> <p>We conclude by talking about broader issues of representation within the film industry, and specifically in the context of her recent membership of the Academy. How effective does she feel that development will be in promoting change and inclusion in the entertainment business? It is, she says, a \u201csubstantial and relevant\u201d move, and she commends the Academy for doing it. But she remains realistic: \u201cWhen you\u2019re in it, it seems slow and it feels slow. When we look back in 100 years, who knows how it will look with hindsight. However, it does feel like we\u2019re turning a corner. It\u2019s not a short corner, it\u2019s a very big bend, and we\u2019re some way around it and we\u2019ve still got a long way to go. Let\u2019s be really honest about this: the Oscars reflect the industry, so the Oscars can change but they can only do so much without the industry changing as well.\u201d</p> <p>In other words the movies need to get made in the first place, so that audiences are not presented with eight identical films when they go to the multiplex. Cinemagoers, too, can play their part, choosing to see a more diverse range of films as they are released, and not necessarily waiting until they come out on DVD.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s really interesting, \u201cshe continues, \u201cthat if you walk into an industry party and it\u2019s predominantly male, predominantly of a certain age, predominantly white, it starts to feel old-fashioned. It doesn\u2019t feel progressive. When you walk into a place and you see women, and you see people of colour, and varying abilities and disabilities, it feels like it\u2019s somehow a reflection of the world \u2013 you\u2019re in the world, and that we\u2019re in a relevant industry.\u201d She laughs, remembering her recent trip to a vibrant Toronto. \u201cThat didn\u2019t mean to say that the lovely old white men were gone. They were still there!\u201d</p> <p>The bottom line, she thinks, is that the industry needs to see a broadening of the wares as a business opportunity, not merely as a matter of morality: \u201cIf you do not have a flourish of new lifeblood,\u201d she says, \u201cyou don\u2019t get a beautiful ocean, you get a dull, dank puddle.\u201d</p> <p><em>A United Kingdom opens the </em><a href=\"https://whatson.bfi.org.uk/lff/Online/default.asp?BOparam::WScontent::loadArticle::permalink=unitedkingdom\"><em>London film festival on Wednesday</em></a><em> and </em><a href=\"http://www.aunitedkingdomfilm.com/\"><em>will be in cinemas from 25 November</em></a></p> <h2>Race on screen: critic Jonathan Romney\u2019s highlights from this year\u2019s London film festival</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fbc23ee529cce4b0df99ea55e96756a7caa9a7a1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fbc23ee529cce4b0df99ea55e96756a7caa9a7a1/0_112_3504_2102/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Teyonah Parris in Chi-Raq.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Teyonah Parris in Chi-Raq.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Lionsgate</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/nov/25/chi-raq-review-spike-lees-urgent-angry-and-very-sexy-midlife-masterpiece\"><strong>Chi-Raq</strong></a><br>Dir: Spike Lee<br><strong>The Greek comedy of Lysistrata\u2019s sex strike, adapted as the story of a Chicago woman who campaigns to stop gang war</strong><br>Spike Lee\u2019s most acclaimed film for ages \u2013 a jovial yet impassioned musical strike against violence within black communities.

He gives it some juice, the line looks good \u2026 because it is good. Plop! In it goes. A birdie! Dustin Johnson to answer. He can\u2019t. Europe 1up in the first match.

He shows lovely touch as he lofts his approach past the flag, spinning it back to within 15ft to set up a fine birdie chance and put a little bit of early pressure on the US pairing. Koepka attempts to salvage something from this hole with a chip from the fringe. It\u2019s good but not good enough. Meanwhile, Dustin Johnson\u2019s approach has left him 30ft away from the pin. He pushes his putt along the undulating green and it\u2019s got the line \u2026 but is agonisingly short. Pieters, from off the back of the green, goes just as close. So McIlroy, from 15ft, to win the hole for Europe. He gives it some juice to secure the line \u2026 but it misses to the left.

Lynch is a quality actor, capable also of fine fast comedy, as in <em>Sliding Doors</em>, but is getting to be the equivalent of listening to Orla Guerin on the radio, whose monotonal voice will drop in timbre only when sighing the word \u201cchildren\u201d.</p> <p>Hence the delight in hearing a clever Belfast doctor, talking quickly. \u201cNone of your CT shite \u2013 he needs to go straight to theatre,\u201d urged Coyle. Theatre was a battleground. The actual surgery was what might have resulted had Keith Floyd made a more than usually visceral cookery programme. For cannibals.

She redeemed herself hugely later, with some fiercely restrained weeping. I still find it unsettling to find such a star in such a very northern Irish cop drama, like seeing Ban Ki-Moon trying on trainers in Sports Direct or, um, watching George Clooney pop up on <em>ER</em>, but there\u2019s little doubt that, when she\u2019s not running pointlessly or looking gormlessly bloodied, her acting in close-ups lends this series even more of its deserved heft.</p> <p>There was a little of the stuff about why one should spend so many hours saving the life of someone who in other times might have been hastened to a noose, but it wasn\u2019t within in their hands, or pay grades, to judge and thus sensibly passed over. That\u2019ll have to be wisely left to our handsomely principled government. Coyle emerged, gruesomely knackered, with the cheerful, legally dodgy yet unassailable: \u201cHow\u2019s our strangler doing?\u201d This opening was his; give the man a spin-off.

  "<p>Akram Khan\u2019s new production of <a href=\"http://giselle.ballet.org.uk/\"><em>Giselle</em></a> for English National Ballet is one of the most eagerly awaited dance works of recent years, and for the most part the excitement and anticipation are justified. <a href=\"http://giselle.ballet.org.uk/creative-team/tim-yip\">Tim Yip</a>\u2019s designs are dramatic, <a href=\"http://giselle.ballet.org.uk/creative-team/vincenzo-lamagna\">Vincenzo Lamagna</a>\u2019s score is compelling, and Khan\u2019s choreography is very fine indeed. But the work is seriously flawed by structural deficiencies and a thready storyline.</p> <p>We discover a group of figures in parchment coloured shifts and tunics facing a massive wall. Their attitudes are those of helplessness and frustration; they are, the programme informs us, migrant workers. <a href=\"http://giselle.ballet.org.uk/creative-team/mark-henderson\">Mark Henderson</a>\u2019s lighting places them in silhouette, as enclosed in their individual solitude as Giacometti statuettes. We hear ominous electronic reverberations, and then, as the dancers pick up a massed folk dance, recognisable melody lines from Adolphe Adam\u2019s original <em>Giselle</em> score begin to surface.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>A ballet is a story told in movement; you should be able to understand every nuance without having to buy a programme</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Giselle (<a href=\"http://www.alinacojocaru.com\">Alina Cojocaru</a>) and Albrecht (<a href=\"http://www.ballet.org.uk/the-company/dancers/isaac-hernandez/\">Isaac Hern\u00e1ndez</a>) detach themselves. He places a tender hand on her belly. Is she pregnant? They dance together, their exchanges infused with longing. Khan\u2019s background is in contemporary and kathak dance, but he understands far better than most classically trained choreographers how emotion is generated by the chemical wedding of music and balletic geometry. As Hern\u00e1ndaz turns Cojocaru in his arms, her form evanescent as a wisp of smoke, you see the absolute expression of her vulnerability and of his wonder and desire.</p> <p>A security klaxon sounds, an ingenious echo of the hunting horn in the original. Wealthy figures emerge, decked out in elaborately sinister finery. En bloc they resemble a nightmarish vision of an imperial court painted by Vel\u00e1squez. The migrants entertain them with dances that make reference to the work\u2019s traditional choreography but gleam with Khan\u2019s idiosyncratic detail, especially in the alignment of hand, wrist and arm. <a href=\"http://www.ballet.org.uk/the-company/dancers/begona-cao/\">Bego\u00f1a Cao</a> is a superbly cold Bathilde. In her rigid condescension, we read not only her sense of entitlement, but her knowledge of Albrecht\u2019s habitual philandering. To Giselle\u2019s anguished discovery of his treachery, she reacts with barely the flicker of an eye. In Act 2, she treats him with undisguised contempt.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMcHPDN41q0\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/JMcHPDN41q0?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMcHPDN41q0\">Watch Akram Khan\u2019s Giselle in rehearsal.</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>By this point, however, the piece\u2019s surface pleasures have been compromised by deeper issues of storytelling. Who exactly is Albrecht? Who is Giselle, and why should we care about either of them? In the original 19th-century ballet, the first fact to be established is that Albrecht is a nobleman in disguise. From this deception \u2013 from our knowledge of it and Giselle\u2019s ignorance of it \u2013 stems the ballet\u2019s tension and, indeed, its entire narrative impulse. It\u2019s what makes us invest in Albrecht. We deplore his behaviour, but there\u2019s not a man alive who doesn\u2019t shiver with fellow-feeling for this duplicitous but ultimately contrite figure. The ballet\u2019s called <em>Giselle</em>, but it\u2019s Albrecht\u2019s story.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"44e9e4be32b3441d4769490c4cf423ffc3b66545\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/44e9e4be32b3441d4769490c4cf423ffc3b66545/0_360_5406_3244/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cesar Corrales, centre, in Akram Khan\u2019s Giselle.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cesar Corrales, centre, in Akram Khan\u2019s Giselle.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Laurent Liotardo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Not here. For all the dark splendour of the production, and the luminosity of the choreography, this version by Khan and dramaturge <a href=\"http://giselle.ballet.org.uk/creative-team/ruth-little\">Ruth Little</a> is no one\u2019s story. We\u2019re never told who Albrecht is. He is apparently one of the migrants, without past or hinterland. As is Giselle, in the original a fully realised character, precisely situated in the village hierarchy, but here rendered anonymous. So while you marvel at the spectacle, and at Cojocaru\u2019s affecting performance, you remain uninvolved. One structural problem leads to another. If Albrecht\u2019s real identity is not established, his interactions with Bathilde and his rejection of Giselle make no sense. Nor does her death, whose cause we never learn. The confusion is compounded when, once unmasked as a member of the privileged caste in Act 1, Albrecht remains dressed as a migrant worker throughout Act 2. Why?</p> <p>As presently configured, Khan and Little\u2019s version of the story is a dream-like meditation on <em>Giselle</em> for those already familiar with the ballet. But not everyone is in the know, and there were some puzzled discussions in the interval on Tuesday\u2019s first night. A ballet is a story told in movement \u2013 you should be able to understand its every nuance without having to buy a programme. If it\u2019s not clear who Hilarion (<a href=\"http://giselle.ballet.org.uk/principal-cast/27-september-2016/cesar-corrales\">Cesar Corrales</a>) is from his actions on stage, it doesn\u2019t help to read that he\u2019s \u201ca shape-changing fixer who trades with and mimics the Landlords for his own and his community\u2019s profit\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/sep/27/akram-khan-giselle-migrant-english-national-ballet-tamara-rojo-interview\">Akram Khan's refugee Giselle: 'A real woman in a catastrophic situation'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>These issues are fixable, and they\u2019re worth fixing, because there\u2019s so much here that\u2019s excellent. In Act 2, obsessed with the dead Giselle, Albrecht performs his own mad scene, a solo with subtle kathak inflexions. We meet Myrtha (a truly chilling turn by <a href=\"http://giselle.ballet.org.uk/principal-cast/27-september-2016/stina-quagebeur\">Stina Quagebeur</a>), who drags Giselle\u2019s body centre stage and reanimates it through sorcery. This intrusion of the supernatural is abrupt; it would help if the legend of the Wilis (here ghosts of garment factory workers) was seeded earlier in the piece. But the Wilis themselves are terrific. Lank-haired, dingy-frocked and baleful, they materialise in vengeful ranks, armed with giant sewing needles.</p> <p>Albrecht and Giselle\u2019s final pas de deux is entrancingly sad.

  "<p>A fascinating and genuinely important period in American history is underserved here by an inelegant structure and unwieldy running time. Matthew McConaughey stars as Confederate deserter turned folk hero Newton Knight, who leads an army of runaway slaves, disillusioned fighters and women against a local government skewed firmly in favour of the landowners. Gugu Mbatha-Raw is the former slave who becomes his common-law wife. There\u2019s a languid quality to much of the film, which flows slower than the waters in the bayou where Knight and his army hide out.

  "<p>One Friday afternoon, I decided to check out a pea-sized lump on my neck that was causing me consternation. I started by calling my GP\u2019s surgery in south London. A recorded message informed me there were no appointments that day; after a few minutes, a receptionist came on the line and said that I could have an appointment on Monday. Not too bad, I thought, until I realised she was not talking about the Monday three days hence, but the one 10 days away. Not so good. I could also try for a walk-in slot or a phone consultation from 8am to 10am on weekday mornings.</p> <p>At this point, I downloaded the app from <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/babylon-health/id858558101?mt=8\" title=\"\">Babylon Health</a>, one of the leaders in online doctor consultations, on to my smartphone. The homepage was purple and teal, the writing welcomingly blobby. I tapped on \u201ccheck a symptom\u201d and after half-a-dozen questions, it suggested that I \u201cbook a consultation\u201d. I was offered a choice between a GP, a specialist or a therapist. The appointment could be on the phone or a video call.</p> <p>I selected a GP and a video call and was booked in to see Dr Patel 34&#xa0;minutes later. As I waited to speak to him, I learned from his biographical detail that he was practising in Leeds, that he\u2019d visited five of the seven continents and enjoyed cycling and skiing. At exactly 3.30pm, he materialised on my phone and welcomed me to Babylon. Our appointment was much like a regular exchange with a GP. There were some surreal moments: as I tried to show Dr Patel my neck, I was reminded of an Amy Schumer comedy sketch on the precariousness and indignity of sexting.</p> <p>But he was engaged and reassuring, calling back when the video feed dropped, and after a few prompts he determined we were probably looking at a sebaceous cyst. They are non-cancerous and can be left alone, as long as they don\u2019t change in size or shape. Soon after the consultation, in case I\u2019d forgotten anything, a video of it was available on my Babylon app and I was sent a short text from Dr Patel that summarised his findings and advice. If I had needed a prescription, it would have been sent within the hour to a local pharmacy. Two days later, my phone beeped with a message to check how I was feeling.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"f8e8d45168196bb44f3bb3846d4be12068596f3e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f8e8d45168196bb44f3bb3846d4be12068596f3e/0_0_696_1294/538.jpg\" alt=\"GP on iPhone\" width=\"538\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>It was a very thorough service, but there was a cost. Babylon offers its triage services, which advise on the urgency of treatment, free, but to speak to a doctor, it\u2019s a rolling monthly payment of \u00a34.99 or a one-off fee of \u00a325. In my case, it provided peace of mind 10 days quicker than if I\u2019d waited to see my GP. But the bigger question is what impact online doctors will have on the provision of healthcare in the UK: are they a valuable tool to reduce the demands on our overloaded doctors and nurses or are they, as one GP I spoke to said, opening \u201ca door to NHS destruction\u201d?</p> <p>The offices of Babylon in South Kensington have been designed to evoke the hanging gardens, one of the seven wonders of the ancient world. A tough brief, you\u2019d imagine, and the original designers estimated a cost of \u00a31,000 per square foot. Ali Parsa, the founder of Babylon, bristled at such extravagance and decided to oversee the decorations himself. The result is a long, open-plan office with fake trees and hanging plants dotted around. All the accoutrements of the kidult, forward-thinking workplace are present: free toast and cereals, ping-pong tables that double as large desks for team meetings. An adult scooter leans against a desk, although it\u2019s not clear if this is personal transportation or to whizz along the banks of desks.</p> <p>Why the name Babylon? \u201cFirst, I was born in Iran,\u201d says Parsa, an energetic, fast-talking 51-year-old with a bald head and statement Cutler &amp; Gross spectacles, \u201cso Babylon was always part of our culture as one of the big Persian cities. And two, there is a story about Babylon that goes really well with healthcare. If you got sick in Babylon about two and a half thousand years ago, you\u2019d stand on the square that was designated as a square of the sick and every resident that passed by would tell you if they\u2019d ever come across that disease and, if they had, how they cured themselves. And with that very simple peer-to-peer health service, they had the longest life expectancy in the world.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We are going to put an affordable health service into the hands of every person on Earth</p> <footer> <cite>Babylon's mission statement</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Parsa laughs: \u201cBut the truth is that all of that is nonsense. We called it Babylon because we were too cheap to pay a design agency or a PR agency to go out and figure out some funky&#xa0;name.\u201d</p> <p>In the reception area, the mission statement of Babylon is written on a large mirror: \u201cOur purpose is to democratise healthcare. We are going to put an accessible and affordable health service into the hands of every person on Earth.\u201d That\u2019s quite an ambitious goal, I suggest.</p> <p>\u201cOf course it\u2019s difficult,\u201d he nods. \u201cBut actually, if you dissect that, the most difficult part is that you put something in the hands of every human being on Earth. Well, somebody already has. Almost every human being on Earth now has a mobile device. What <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/sep/27/elon-musk-spacex-mars-colony\" title=\"\">Elon Musk is doing with SpaceX</a>, creating a ship, sending it to space, that\u2019s difficult! Putting a doctor on your mobile phone, relatively speaking, is not difficult.\u201d</p> <p>A number of progressive tech entrepreneurs appear to agree with Parsa. <a href=\"https://www.pushdoctor.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Push Doctor</a>, founded by Eren Ozagir, claims to be the largest service of its kind in Europe, with about 7,000 NHS doctors in its network. It came about, apparently, after Ozagir fell sick on a trip to the US and bemoaned the fact that you could organise a taxi, a boat, even a helicopter through your phone, but not a doctor. Push Doctor does not attempt to triage or diagnose patients, but instead puts them straight in touch with GPs doing consultations during the time they could otherwise be doing private practice. An appointment costs at least \u00a320 and a premium membership is the same price per month.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/04/googles-deepmind-shouldnt-be-sucking-up-our-nhs-records-in-secret\">Google's DeepMind shouldn't suck up our NHS records in secret</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Other players in this market include <a href=\"http://www.drnow.com/\" title=\"\">Now GP</a> and <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/GB/app/id1051208054?mt=8\" title=\"\">GPDQ</a> (GP delivered quick). GPDQ can arrange for a doctor to come in person to a home, office or hotel in central London between 8am and 11pm, 365 days a year. The average wait is about 90 minutes.</p> <p>The core message of all of these services is that they are not threatening the NHS, but working alongside it to reduce the burdens it faces coping with a growing and ageing population. Babylon, for example, has started a trial scheme with two GP surgeries in Essex where all patients can use the service free of charge. Early reports apparently found that the average waiting time for appointments came down by a week, to two weeks.</p> <p>The development also fits with the idea that millennials now expect all their services to be streamlined and efficient: from getting the new ramen joint to deliver via Uber to having your dry cleaning picked up from your desk. David Mott from Oxford Capital, which raised \u00a38.2m in funding for Push Doctor, even suggested the NHS should be left to the elderly and infirm, while time-poor 18-40-year-olds use the new app-based services.</p> <p>Where Babylon seems to be taking the lead \u2013 and, Parsa believes, reducing the crisis of the global shortfall of doctors \u2013 is with its use of artificial intelligence. When I tried its \u201ccheck a symptom\u201d feature for the lump on my neck, I was actually being quizzed by what they consider the world\u2019s first accurate AI triage service. In June, an in-house \u201clive challenge\u201d pitted Babylon\u2019s AI against a senior A&amp;E nurse and an Oxford-educated junior doctor. UCL professor Irwin Nazareth compared the results. According to Nazareth, \u201ccheck a symptom\u201d was consistently faster and more accurate in triaging patients than its human rivals: it scored 92% accuracy compared to the doctor\u2019s 82% and the nurse\u2019s 77%.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c886d33987eb8aa75a356eb33165d77ab578769d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c886d33987eb8aa75a356eb33165d77ab578769d/136_146_2462_1764/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Push Doctor\" width=\"1000\" height=\"716\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Push Doctor offers video consultation with NHS GPs, who can provide sick notes, referral letters and prescriptions.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR Agency One</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This experiment was not the most rigorous of scientific evaluations, but it has shown enough promise for some heavyweight backers to get behind Babylon. In January 2016, the company raised \u00a319m to further develop its artificial-intelligence platform. Demis Hassabis and Mustafa Suleyman, co-founders of DeepMind, the AI startup bought by Google for $500m, who had already been advising Babylon, invested, as did <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/feb/18/theobserver.observerbusiness12\" title=\"\">Richard Reed, Adam Balon and Jon Wright</a>, the men behind Innocent Drinks. For Parsa, the next stage, probably as soon as next year, is that the Babylon app will be able to diagnose patients without a doctor ever needing to be involved.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d trust a machine over a human any day of the week \u2013 and I already do,\u201d says Parsa, whose background is in engineering, not medicine. He arrived in Britain as a refugee in his late teens and has been, among other things, an investment banker and co-founder of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/jan/09/circle-patients-hinchingbrooke-sick-dream-impossible\" title=\"\">Circle</a>, the private healthcare company that runs hospitals in Bath and Reading and in 2011 took over the struggling Hinchingbrooke hospital in Cambridgeshire. Parsa stood down as Circle\u2019s chief executive in 2012, before launching Babylon in 2014.</p> <p>\u201cThe machine doesn\u2019t get worked up, it doesn\u2019t get angry, it doesn\u2019t get pushed because there are 20 people outside in the queue,\u201d says Parsa. \u201cA machine learns every time a diagnosis happens. A doctor might do 7,000 consultations. The machine will do thousands of times more. Therefore the speed at which it learns and everything it sees increases. So we believe in time we will do this more accurately than a human.</p> <p>\u201cEven the specialists. How many papers were published last year on dermatology? It was 11,000; 11,000 pieces of research that were worthy of being written down for somebody to take note. Which dermatologist reads this? They say, \u2018Oh yeah, I spend my weekends catching up.\u2019 How many can they read? So the idea that a human brain can keep in touch \u2013 ha!\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jul/05/google-deepmind-nhs-machine-learning-blindness\">Google DeepMind pairs with NHS to use machine learning to fight blindness</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Parsa does not think that artificial intelligence will replace humans \u2013 at least not in the foreseeable future. But the potential is clearly there. He cites the example of <a href=\"https://deepmind.com/research/alphago/\" title=\"\">DeepMind\u2019s AlphaGo program</a>, which inflicted a stunning 4-1 defeat on the 18-time Go world champion Lee Sedol earlier this year. The 3,000-year-old Chinese boardgame had been considered one of the \u201cgrand challenges\u201d of AI because of its almost infinite number of possible moves. DeepMind puts the success of AlphaGo down to the fact that the program almost mirrored a human brain: it used trial and error, allied to a dense historical database of games from the past, to play both creatively and minimise mistakes.</p> <p>\u201cThe one game AlphaGo lost was because the guy [Lee] did something that the machine had never imagined can be done,\u201d says Parsa. \u201cHe used his intuition to say, \u2018You know what? I\u2019m going to do something very human here.\u2019 As opposed to something very machine. And the machine got confused. So the methodology we employ is very similar to the way a human brain works, whereby we teach a human how to become a doctor and the same way we teach a machine how to become a doctor. We don\u2019t just use ginormous amounts of data, we give them rules and functions.\u201d</p> <p>It takes around seven years to train a human to become a doctor \u2013 how long then for a machine? \u201cWell, we\u2019ve been at it for three years,\u201d says Parsa, \u201cso maybe it will take us seven years too.\u201d</p> <p>Not everyone is excited about the boom in online doctors. While there has been a rush by GPs to supplement their incomes with shifts at places such as Babylon \u2013 it has about 100 doctors on call \u2013 others are concerned about the impact that paid-for services will have on the NHS.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"d192878149bacd2cc3c7b5a3464b5122dac3049c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d192878149bacd2cc3c7b5a3464b5122dac3049c/0_0_616_1255/491.png\" alt=\"Now GP\" width=\"491\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Now GP offers video GP services and can courier prescription medicines to your home for a fee.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: NowGP handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cGeneral practitioners are a resource in short supply and in great need,\u201d says Margaret McCartney, a GP in Glasgow, Radio 4 regular and author of the forthcoming <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/state-of-medicine.html\" title=\"\"><em>The State of Medicine: Keeping the Promise of the NHS</em></a>. \u201cWe as a profession are under huge strain and enormous pressure. These companies are essentially using market forces to determine access to GPs rather than need. GPs working in these companies will probably make more money and have a less stressful career. However, patients are far less likely to benefit. This might work in your favour if you are basically healthy, need a one-off appointment and have the money to pay to put yourself in the front of the queue. But if you have an ongoing condition, or multiple or complex needs, the research shows that your care will be better if you have continuity and are looked after by a team that can care for you holistically.\u201d</p> <p>The idea of \u201ca GP in your pocket\u201d emphasises speed and convenience, but McCartney fears that it may ultimately derail our health service. \u201cThese schemes may mean that you end up having to wait even longer to see your NHS&#xa0;GP, as the workforce becomes more depleted,\u201d she says. \u201cSome of these companies won\u2019t see people with chronic diseases or mental illness. This kind of cherry-picking is rife in the private sector and I see these companies as the thin end of the wedge of sleepwalking us into an insurance-based model of healthcare. It needs to be resisted by everyone who cares about the values of the NHS.\u201d</p> <p>Parsa is aware that not everyone will approve of services such as Babylon. \u201cListen, there will be many comments from your readers that say, \u2018That is brilliant.\u2019 And there will be many that say, \u2018That is awful.\u2019 That\u2019s OK. Think of anything: Facebook \u2013 lots of people say it\u2019s brilliant and lots of people think it\u2019s awful. But the existing model of healthcare we\u2019ve got, guys, is nothing to write home about. One in five of us can\u2019t see a doctor when we need to. One of eight of us gets misdiagnosed. About a thousand of us a month get killed because of avoidable mistakes. So the system we are protecting so much is good but it\u2019s not great.\u201d</p> <p>There has been much discussion of the failure of Britain\u2019s technology sector to produce a Facebook, Uber or Airbnb. Parsa feels that Babylon has the potential to become a similar, game-changing enterprise. <em>Wired </em>magazine recently named the company as one of Europe\u2019s 100 hottest startups and the <em>FT</em> made a conservative valuation of it \u201cin excess\u201d of \u00a377m. Babylon is certainly thinking globally; although its main operation is in the UK, the service is also launching in Rwanda, a country of 11.75 million people that has only a few hundred doctors.</p> <p>Parsa insists that Rwanda is not a publicity stunt: it\u2019s a country where mobile phones are commonplace and it has a progressive, if often heavyhanded, government. Besides, if Babylon can work in sub-Saharan Africa, then it should thrive anywhere. \u201cIn Rwanda or in many countries in the world, people are dying from things that a doctor can fix in no time,\u201d he says. \u201cSo this is not populist. If you\u2019re not doing it, it\u2019s stupid. If you\u2019re waiting two weeks to see a doctor and you can press a button and see it on Babylon, it\u2019s not right.\u201d A shake of the head: \u201cThat\u2019s not right.\u201d</p> <p>Parsa is a convincing pitchman and my first experience with Babylon for my neck was a good one. But, until it becomes clearer how online doctors can coexist with our health service without diminishing it, it will remain hard to savour the benefits it can&#xa0;provide.</p>",

These came to be two of Jan\u2019s favourite cities, and she later wrote wonderful books about them both. In Palestine, James was an intelligence officer, and conceived a fascination with the Arab world. After returning to Oxford to take his degree, he secured a job at the Arab News Agency in Cairo.</p> <p>A career in journalism followed, first at the Times and later at what was still then the Manchester Guardian. He accompanied the British Mount Everest expedition of 1953, securing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/jan/12/topstories3.mainsection\" title=\"\">one of the great journalistic coups of the 20th century</a>. Although the Times had exclusive rights to cover the expedition, James was concerned that other newspapers might steal his story, and devised a code that would make news of success appear to be news of failure. Once Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay had reached the peak, James scrambled down the mountain, at great risk, to delivered his despatch at a radio station in the nearest town. It read: \u201cSnow conditions bad stop advanced base abandoned yesterday stop awaiting improvement.\u201d Which actually meant: \u201cSummit of Everest reached on 29th May by Hillary and Tenzing.\u201d This news arrived in London on the eve of the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II, enabling the Times to run its story on a day when the nation was celebrating the dawn of a new Elizabethan Age.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"06ffc92b66fd8f99218827fb3bfd7bf1ce192df3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/06ffc92b66fd8f99218827fb3bfd7bf1ce192df3/0_88_2937_1762/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jan Morris\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Morris in 2001.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Eamonn McCabe/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>James parted company with the Times over its line on the Suez crisis of 1956, and went over to the Guardian. Suez led to his other major journalistic scoop: the report that the French and the British were engaged in a covert attempt to invade Egypt under the guise of a mission to maintain peace between Egypt and Israel. Having seen first-hand the fighting in the Negev desert and the Suez Canal Zone, James flew to Cyprus to escape Israeli censorship and file his story. There he got into conversation with French pilots who admitted that they and the British were flying missions against Egyptian forces. The new editor of the Guardian, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/1999/oct/04/guardianobituaries\" title=\"\">Alastair Hetherington</a>, bravely decided to print this incendiary story. The British and French were shamed into withdrawing their forces, and Anthony Eden was later obliged to resign as prime minister.</p> <p>At the beginning of the 1960s, James began his book-writing career in earnest, writing on America, the Arab world, Everest, Venice, Spain, Oxford, Sydney and Hong Kong. In 1964, he embarked on what Jan subsequently described as \u201cthe intellectual and artistic centrepiece of my life\u201d: the Pax Britannica<em> </em>trilogy, which traced the history of the British empire.</p> <p>What is it that renders Jan\u2019s style so distinctive? She is a supremely skilled writer who involves the reader while she remains unobtrusively present herself; who uses the particular to illustrate the general, and scatters grace notes here and there like benefactions. These skills are matched by her talents for observation and analysis, and her wonderful ability (despite being only a moderately endowed linguist) to engage people and draw them out. She is a watcher, usually alone, seldom lonely, alert to everything around her.</p> <p>By the early 80s, Jan Morris had been pretty much everywhere, and she must have a claim to being the most widely travelled person alive today. Standing in Tiananmen Square in Beijing in 1983, she felt that she had fulfilled a \u201cperhaps jejune\u201d ambition to visit and portray all the chief cities of the world. This remarkable achievement invites consideration of what underlies it. There was something compulsive about Jan\u2019s travelling, something apparently not willed by her but driven by forces beyond her control. This was travel as a quest, as \u201can outer expression of my inner journey\u201d.</p> <p><em>Conundrum</em>, which was a worldwide bestseller when it was published in 1974, describes the process that led to a&#xa0;clinic in Casablanca, and the adjustment to life as a woman. It is a&#xa0;powerful and beautifully written document, from which Jan and her lifelong partner Elizabeth emerge as heroines of a sort. While gender reassignment operations had been conducted on many people before, none of them had Jan\u2019s public profile. There were great stresses, for Jan, Elizabeth and their four children, but they have remained a close-knit and loyal family.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"24c56a12b4dc02e87c812478b08adec48aa456fc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/24c56a12b4dc02e87c812478b08adec48aa456fc/0_63_3888_2333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"At home in north Wales in 2007.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">At home in north Wales in 2007.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Colin McPherson/Corbis via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At the same time that Jan was transitioning from male to female, she was also moving from being thoroughly English (Oxford, the army, the Times) to thoroughly Welsh. Jan and Elizabeth bought a big house in the far north-west of Wales, where they still live, and Jan began to embrace a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/aug/06/comment.politics2\" title=\"\">Welsh republicanism</a> that has become one of the great passions of her life. When Jan and Elizabeth die, they will be buried together on an island in a stream near their home, beneath a stone bearing an inscription in both English and Welsh that says: \u201cHere lie two friends, at the end of one life.\u201d</p> <p>During the course of that life, Jan has gone wherever she pleased, and reported back on what the world is like for those of us who have not taken the trouble to explore it fully or with such an open mind.

  "<p><a href=\"https://www.brb.org.uk/profile/david-bintley\">David Bintley</a> is a choreographer, and since 1995 has been artistic director of Birmingham Royal Ballet. Born in a Pennine village, he trained at the Royal Ballet school, where he created his first dance pieces. These were seen and admired by Sir Frederick Ashton, the Royal Ballet\u2019s founder choreographer. \u201cHe\u2019s the only one,\u201d Ashton said, in recognition of the teenage student\u2019s talent. Now 59, Bintley remains a prolific dance-maker, working in both the abstract and narrative genres. His latest work for BRB is a full-length version of <a href=\"https://www.brb.org.uk/whats-on/event/the-tempest\"><em>The Tempest</em></a>.</p> <p><strong>Why did you choose to turn this Shakespeare play into a ballet?</strong><br><em>The Tempest</em> is so full of poetry and imagery, and the characters are so enticing, choreographically. I read it constantly, and re-read the pertinent scene before every rehearsal. We\u2019ve just been working on <a href=\"http://findingshakespeare.co.uk/when-i-waked-i-cried-to-dream-again\">Caliban\u2019s dream</a>: \u201cBe not afeard; the isle is full of noises/ Sounds and sweet airs, that give delight and hurt not.\u201d It\u2019s Caliban\u2019s great moment of perception. A creature who has always been treated as an animal, talking about heaven.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Today, there\u2019s a move back from the ultra-physical towards emotion in ballet</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>Has the piece got a message for today\u2019s audiences?</strong><br>It\u2019s a story about a man who has been wronged, and has lived off the idea of revenge, only to realise that the only path to peace is through forgiveness. It\u2019s this view of forgiveness, of redemption, of letting go of vengeance, that\u2019s so pertinent today. Think of slavery, for example, or the post-colonial treatment of indigenous peoples.</p> <p><strong>What will Prospero\u2019s island look like?</strong><br>The designs are by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/jan/18/rae-smith-alls-well-that-ends-well-staging-shakespeare-400-anniversary\">Rae Smith</a>, of <em>War Horse</em> fame. It\u2019s very bare. There\u2019s a fixed set, which is very stark. I wanted to tell the story through the people, the characters who inhabit it. The setting is the late Elizabethan, early Jacobean era, and we\u2019ve got a shipwreck, a vanishing banquet, people flying\u2026 The music\u2019s central to all of this. I\u2019ve been thinking about <em>The Tempest</em> for a long time, and in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/aug/25/viola-theft-composer-sally-beamish-proms-merula-perpetua\">Sally Beamish</a> I\u2019ve finally found the right composer.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3f288b177778fb0ac2b0af1067197a665e2b20af\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3f288b177778fb0ac2b0af1067197a665e2b20af/0_0_4757_3364/1000.jpg\" alt=\"David Bintley, left, in rehearsals for The Tempest at Birmingham Royal Ballet.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"707\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">David Bintley, left, in rehearsals for The Tempest at Birmingham Royal Ballet.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Ross</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>As a choreographer, you\u2019ve been notable for moving between genres. Story ballets, fairytale ballets, plotless ballets\u2026 </strong><br>Growing up with the work of people like Ashton, John Cranko and Kenneth MacMillan, I thought doing everything was what a choreographer did. But even in my most plotless works I\u2019ve tried to capture a spirit, something that moves people. And every great abstract work, like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2009/jul/30/dance-george-balanchine\">Balanchine</a>\u2019s <em>Serenade</em>, or <em>Agon</em>, tells a story. Those pieces are not just bright and shiny. The whole of life is storytelling. Every hour of every day is an unfolding story, for everyone.</p> <p><strong>You\u2019ve been the director of BRB for more than 20 years now. What stamp have you put on the company?</strong><br>Every ballet company has its personality, its mission. Perhaps we look further back in time than most, in that we do works by Ashton, Cranko, <a href=\"http://www.roh.org.uk/people/ninette-de-valois\">Ninette de Valois</a> and others. The early British ballet heritage is very strongly represented in Birmingham. Also, we have a great tradition of good acting. I\u2019ve always felt that art should touch people, rather than just impress them.</p> <p>Today there\u2019s a move back from the ultra-physical towards emotion \u2013 you can see this in the work of other British choreographers like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2012/nov/11/liam-scarlett-dancer-choreographer\">Liam Scarlett</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/christopherwheeldon\">Christopher Wheeldon</a>. Dance-wise, all of the pieces that I\u2019ve created are very much mine, from the abstract work to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2012/feb/26/hobsons-choice-birmingham-royal-review\"><em>Hobson\u2019s Choice</em></a>, set in a Salford shoe shop. You\u2019ve got to be damned for who you are, to stay true to your background and roots.</p> <p><strong>Do you think that there\u2019s a long-term future for narrative ballet?</strong><br>I have no doubt that there is. Ballet began by telling stories \u2013 mythical tales of gods and goddesses. People like stories, and they always will. As choreographers and as dancers on stage, we don\u2019t just tell stories, we tell stories through dance. And that\u2019s what I want to keep on doing.</p> <ul> <li>David Bintley\u2019s production of <a href=\"https://www.brb.org.uk/whats-on/event/the-tempest\">The Tempest</a> is at <a href=\"https://www.brb.org.uk/whats-on/venue/birmingham-hippodrome\">Birmingham Hippodrome</a> until 8 October, then tours to <a href=\"https://www.brb.org.uk/whats-on/venue/sadlers-wells\">Sadler\u2019s Wells</a>, London (13-15 October), <a href=\"https://www.brb.org.uk/whats-on/venue/sunderland-empire\">Sunderland Empire</a> (20-22) and <a href=\"https://www.brb.org.uk/whats-on/venue/theatre-royal\">Theatre Royal Plymouth</a> (27-29)<br></li> </ul>",

I don\u2019t totally recognise the characterisation of inscrutable, but it\u2019s possible I kept people at arm\u2019s length a bit.\u201d</p> <p>And it\u2019s this, I think afterwards, that maybe explains his success as an interviewer: his ability to get close to people without losing his outsider\u2019s edge \u2013 his detachment.</p> <p>\u201cI think I have a slight fear of intimacy. That\u2019s the thing I would say on that. That explains it, doesn\u2019t it? I have a slight fear of intimacy, and I think, that\u2019s partly why I do the work that I do. It\u2019s a safe form of intimacy in which I\u2019m professionally accountable, but I\u2019m not, in a sense. I mean, obviously, I am personally accountable, but it feels there\u2019s a sort of emotional prophylactic.\u201d</p> <p>There\u2019s a scene in a recent film he made about alcoholics, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/apr/24/drinking-to-oblivion-louis-theroux\"><em>Drinking to Oblivion</em></a>, where Joe, a desperate young man needing treatment, checks himself out of the clinic and hotfoots it down the street. I watched that, I say, thinking I\u2019d have found it hard not to have gone running down the road after him.</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t feel tempted to chase him down the street. It was, obviously, awkward. It was an emotionally difficult moment.\u201d</p> <p>And it\u2019s this, when he, and his films, are at their best \u2013 in their emotionally difficult moments. He has the ability of being present but holding back, a quality which I realise is there again in the clashes he has with his main interview subject, <a href=\"https://markrathbun.wordpress.com/\">Marty Rathbun</a>, a high-profile ex-Scientologist, who is at the heart of his latest and most ambitious film, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcfilms/film/my_scientology_movie\"><em>My Scientology Movie</em></a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5587008f5baec00c174a675fbadb8e159e08bf73\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5587008f5baec00c174a675fbadb8e159e08bf73/0_128_1920_1152/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cult film: My Scientology Movie is Theroux\u2019s first theatrical feature-length work.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cult film: <em>My Scientology Movie</em> is Theroux\u2019s first theatrical feature-length work.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Flat Creek Films/BBC Worldwide</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It\u2019s something of a landmark for Theroux because he\u2019s been making documentaries for the BBC since 1998 and has won awards and critical praise and garnered a fervent and loyal fanbase, but, in the intervening years, documentaries have transformed from niche programmes on TV to big-budget cinema features, and this is his first ever theatrical feature-length work.</p> <p>\u201cDoes it feel like a big deal?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes. It\u2019s a whole new way of working. At every stage it felt like a bit of a leap in the dark. And there was much, much more money involved.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>'It felt like a bit of a leap in the dark. And there was much, much more money involved'</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>There was also the not insignificant problem of the fact that he had no access. The church is notoriously press shy and in the absence of a real <a href=\"https://www.scientology.org/david-miscavige/\">David Miscavige</a> (the leader of Scientology) or a real Tom Cruise (its most famous follower) he and Marty Rathbun, who was once the organisation\u2019s inspector general, recruited actors to re-enact scenes Rathbun witnessed. They auditioned a dozen David Miscaviges and a whole load of Tom Cruises, and Rathbun comes alive as the faux-Miscavige pins Theroux up against the wall and grabs him by the throat, just as, he says, Miscavige once did to him.</p> <p>In some ways, it feels like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/nick-broomfield\">Nick Broomfield</a> by way of <em>The Act of Killing</em>, I tell him \u2013 the Oscar-winning documentary by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/mar/27/50-best-documentaries-alex-gibney-joshua-oppenheimer-james-marsh\">Joshua Oppenheimer</a> which featured an Indonesian general re-enacting scenes of mass murder.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m going to pick on the Nick Broomfield thing, not that I don\u2019t admire him, but we didn\u2019t want it to look like it\u2019s a pale imitation of Nick Broomfield, where because you don\u2019t have access, you\u2019re in danger of doing a film about door-knocking, or making calls on the mobile from the hotel room. The world doesn\u2019t need another Nick Broomfield. We also looked at filming undercover, but that felt like a sort of betrayal of something essential about what I do, which is that it should be in good faith.\u201d</p> <p>Instead, the lack of access forced them to come up with a more creative approach. \u201cAnd then the idea of re-enactments came up and it sort of clicked, because of it being Hollywood. And <em>The Act of Killing </em>was a tipping point because, in that, it didn\u2019t feel like a gimmick or a stunt. It\u2019s actually a way of drawing more out of the contributors, almost like therapeutic role play.\u201d</p> <p>The result is like a heightened, slightly stoned version of a regular Louis Theroux documentary. It has all the hallmarks of a classic Theroux, but with added surrealism. It\u2019s absurd and funny \u2013 Theroux filming the Scientologists filming him \u2013 and it\u2019s already a hit: the film with live broadcast Q&amp;A is due to play in 200 cinemas nationwide, many of which have already sold out. In some ways, I say, you\u2019re trolling Scientology. \u201cYou wanted to get a reaction from them, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI argue with the term trolling.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cProdding, then?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, prodding. I mean, in a sense, there hasn\u2019t been a film about Scientology that hasn\u2019t, if you wanted to characterise it unkindly, trolled Scientology. It\u2019s in their tech \u2013 their teachings, they call it tech \u2013 that if they are, as they see it, attacked, they fight back. Did I know? I mean, I more than knew, of course, I slightly hoped they would come and harass and surveil us and follow us around with private investigators. It\u2019s what makes them so extraordinary, as a religion: their willingness to not only turn the other cheek, but to actually slap back.\u201d</p> <p>The church has been on his radar for years, but he could never quite figure out a way to do it, and in its examination of a weird, American cult, it\u2019s in the vein of many of his earlier works, from his first television outings on Michael Moore\u2019s <em>TV Nation</em> to his first BBC series which followed, <em>Weird Weekends</em>. The last time I saw him was in New York, nanoseconds before he got the job on <em>TV Nation,</em> and actually pre-fame Louis and post-fame Louis are pretty much the same Louis. He\u2019s one of that rare breed of people who seem the same onscreen as they do off and even with the Bamber Gascoigne hair do, he was still funny and charismatic back then \u2013 with the strange demi-fame of having a famous father, the writer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/paul-theroux\">Paul Theroux</a>. It was no surprise at all that while the rest of us were still waiting tables or trying to figure out what to do with our lives, he went off and became a cult TV star.</p> <p>Though, at the time, I assumed he\u2019d find fame as a writer. He was a natural and, a quarter of a century on, I\u2019m able to quote a piece of student journalism he wrote back at him. \u201cYou used to dissolve a packet of ProPlus in a mug of coffee before you went to bed,\u201d I remind him, \u201cset your alarm clock, drink it, fall back to sleep, and wake up bolt upright 15 minutes later.\u201d Until, he wrote, he learned that Elvis did the same. Shortly before he died on the toilet, aged 42.</p> <p>\u201cI was always attracted and repelled by the idea of being a writer,\u201d he says. \u201cI both admired my father and his writing and I saw how much he valued it. And, he used to tell me, growing up: \u2018I\u2019m reading your letters and I\u2019ve seen it, whatever it is, you\u2019ve got it.\u2019 I was literally about 14 or 15 and the letters definitely had no evidence of natural writing ability, but I remember him giving me the talk: \u2018You\u2019ve got the keys to the kingdom.\u2019 And feeling flattered and kind of frightened. It was slightly paralysing. He still takes me aside and says: \u2018Have you thought about writing something longer?\u2019 And in some ways I want to live up to that and, in another way, I want to run a million miles.\u201d</p> <p>And anyway, he says, \u201csuccess came more easily through television. Whether through any natural ability or just through a large dose of very good luck that I was hired for a job, early on, where I was just on camera.\u201d</p> <p>I wonder if this has had its own toll, in a way. Success came so easily to him at such a young age and he\u2019s not just been Louis Theroux all this time, he\u2019s also, in a sense, played him; performed him. It\u2019s one of the more arresting scenes in the film when Marty Rathbun takes issue with the way Theroux commands a group of young actors who are playing Scientology recruits. \u201cThat\u2019s mind control,\u201d he rails. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be any part of it. They all went and followed this new cult leader \u2013 the Louis Theroux cult.\u201d</p> <p>There are a lot of different levels to it, but the dynamics of fame, and its corollary, power, have always come into Theroux\u2019s work. Reading his previous interviews and reviews, there\u2019s a familiar narrative that\u2019s told about him, how he\u2019s gradually sloughed off the comic quirkiness of his early Theroux work to become the more mature filmmaker of his mid-Theroux years. In recent times he\u2019s made films about alcoholics and dementia and transgender children. But I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s actually true. He\u2019s spoken out about his \u201cfailure\u201d to unmask Jimmy Savile in the programme he made about him, but the only reason we knew how weird and odd Jimmy Savile was, was as a result of that film.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4d1a3f0b5b34c5a20b652070831dcceb3e319fb7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4d1a3f0b5b34c5a20b652070831dcceb3e319fb7/0_0_2054_1233/1000.jpg\" alt=\"When Louis Met Jimmy: \u2018What I\u2019ve had to get my head around is the fact that I grew to like him\u2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">When Louis Met Jimmy: \u2018What I\u2019ve had to get my head around is the fact that I grew to like him\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Justin Evans/BBC TWO</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/nov/03/louis-theroux-jimmy-savile-documentary-top-of-the-pops\"><em>When Louis Met Jimmy</em></a> was Theroux\u2019s first full-length television profile, made all the way back in 2000, and at the time it was broadcast it was a revelation. And it still is now. As was his film on Max Clifford. In hindsight, phone hacking, media manipulation, power networks and paedophilia were some of the biggest stories that never managed to be told of the 90s and early 2000s, and no one got closer to them than Theroux. I\u2019ve rewatched both in recent times and the moment when Theroux is in Jimmy Savile\u2019s mother\u2019s bedroom is properly jaw-dropping TV.</p> <p>\u201cI was sort of relieved when I went and watched it again, within the space of weeks after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/feb/24/mark-williams-thomas-jimmy-savile\">Mark Williams-Thomas\u2019s programme</a> [on Savile] came out. And it\u2019s not the cuddly portrait of an eccentric. But then as much as I\u2019d like to think that I got Jimmy Savile right, I didn\u2019t imagine him to be capable of those crimes. And what I\u2019ve had to get my head around is the fact that I grew to like him. I kept friendly relations with him for a few years after making the programme.\u201d</p> <p>Savile gulled him as he gulled the nation, and the hows and whys of that are the subject of a new Theroux film, a sequel to the original, called <em>Louis Theroux: Savile</em>.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve had to revisit that and think about that. Who was he? How much of the person that I thought I knew was real? And you have to re-evaluate and unpick a lot of memories and think about that. I mean, I knew I never quite got his number. I knew there was an aspect of his life to do with his sexual interests that remained opaque to me.\u201d</p> <p>And I can\u2019t help bringing up a comment he made more than a decade ago, in reference to the Savile film, about how he\u2019s been drawn to some of his interview subjects as something like father figures.</p> <p>\u201cRight. Did I say that? Yes, I did, I think. I remember.\u201d</p> <p>I can\u2019t help asking it because the dynamics of the Theroux family, much of which has been played out in public, are endlessly fascinating. In 1989, while still married to Louis\u2019 mother, Anne, Paul Theroux published a novel about a fictional writer who travelled the world seeking erotic encounters and having affairs. They divorced shortly after. And <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/marcel-theroux\">Marcel Theroux</a>, Louis\u2019 brother, who combines the family professions by being both a novelist and a documentary maker, has talked in interviews about how they\u2019d taunt each other, both claiming the other was \u201cJack\u201d, the \u201cdepressing, sad, dusty figure\u201d who was the character\u2019s fictional son.</p> <p>\u201cI just thought it was interesting,\u201d I say, \u201cbecause these particular interview subjects \u2013 Savile and Clifford \u2013 are very charismatic, as your father is, but they\u2019re also classic unreliable narrators. And in that sense your father was, too.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes\u2026 in a sense, I suppose. But he\u2019s also a very nice man. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s not different from a lot of relationships people have with their parents except that these works, his secret life, is present in his books. Both as a writer, as a traveller and then, also, I suppose, someone who, it turns out, wasn\u2019t in a committed relationship.\u201d</p> <p>Perhaps, but it helps shine a light, maybe, on why he\u2019s been drawn to individuals who also have a hidden life. He didn\u2019t get to hold David Miscavige to account in <em>My Scientology Movie</em>. Nobody can. He hasn\u2019t done an interview since 1998. And while the film is a jokier, quirkier, more screwball take on Scientology than Alex Gibney\u2019s recent <em>Going Clear</em>, it feels like there\u2019s also an emotional truth lurking there.</p> <p>The laconic persona that Theroux projects on screen, the jokes and the gags, the affable asides, are, maybe, a diversion: he\u2019s also serving up the darkness at the heart of Scientology, too. And I wonder if we\u2019ll look back on it in the future as we look back on the Savile and Clifford films now. That he nearly got there.</p> <p>My Scientology Movie<em> is in cinemas from 7 October. On 10 October there is a special screening of the film followed by an evening with Louis Theroux, broadcast live from the Royal Festival Hall to participating cinemas.

  "<p>My husband was trying, with some urgency, to tell me something. I knew it was important because he had thrown by the wayside the strictest rule of our bilingual household: no mixing English and French. We\u2019d always tried to stay away from Franglish.</p> <p>With its \u201cj\u2019agree\u201ds and \u201cle footing\u201ds, it seemed slightly embarrassing, the labradoodle of languages. But there he was, saying: \u201cThere\u2019s a hanneton on the wall! Get the hanneton!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA what?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA hanneton!\u201d Olivier replied. \u201cI don\u2019t know how to say it in English.\u201d</p> <p>The fact that this French word, in our hour of need, began with the dread silent \u201ch\u201d wasn\u2019t helping matters. Olivier\u2019s vowel-heavy, evenly stressed delivery \u2013 uh an uh ton \u2013 left me grasping at syllables. I couldn\u2019t tell what letter the word began with; where it started and ended; whether it was animal, vegetable, mineral, or, like, a dirty sock.</p> <p>\u201cWhat does it do?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a bug.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow do you spell it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cH-a-n-n-e-t-o-n.\u201d</p> <p>I punched the letters into the Larousse app that occupied the bottom right-hand corner of my phone screen, as crucial to my daily getting around as Uber or Google Maps.</p> <p>\u201cHanneton, nom masculin,\u201d the result came back. The English for \u201channeton,\u201d it said, was \u201ccockchafer\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I wasn\u2019t sure what Olivier was saying, but I\u2019ve never had a cockchafer on my wall before</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I wasn\u2019t sure what Olivier was suggesting. I don\u2019t know about you, but I\u2019ve never had a cockchafer on my wall. Eventually, with some more Googling, we deduced that a hanneton was a cockchafer, which was a May bug. Olivier and I may very well be the only people in the world that are privy to this little bit of strange, near-pornographic entomology-in-translation. I added another entry to our private dictionary, an obscure book that we\u2019ve been compiling since we fell in love and started trying to have a conversation.</p> <p>The critic <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2001/mar/11/society\">George Steiner</a> defined intimacy as \u201cconfident, quasi-immediate translation,\u201d a state of linguistic harmony in which \u201cthe external vulgate and the private mass of language grow more and more concordant.\u201d When Olivier and I met, six years earlier \u2013 a Frenchman and an American at a party above a Polish restaurant in London \u2013 our slate was essentially blank. He spoke good English, but I spoke zero French, and this inhibited our intimacy in ways that we scarcely comprehended. The words, most of the time, were there, but we had no common understanding of their deeper meanings.</p> <p>Our messages to each other were diverted by context and intonation, returned to sender by virtue of body language and facial expression. I constantly thought Olivier looked irritated. I didn\u2019t understand then that smiles are accessories. We put them on, same as hats or moustaches, according to the whims of our culture. When we argued, I would try to resolve the conflict as I\u2019d been taught, saying, \u201cI want this\u201d and \u201cI need that\u201d, in an attempt to avoid the accusatory second-person. He took this as evidence of my narcissism and, furthermore, an infuriating attempt, on my part, to tell him what to do. I wanted compromise. He wanted the right answer and, being French, was sure that there always was one. Trying to access each other\u2019s assumptions and intentions felt impossible, as though someone had deleted our shared hard drive.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"66dcfa1a102b7fa65e5114b7b004c1c62cbe874e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/66dcfa1a102b7fa65e5114b7b004c1c62cbe874e/0_1004_4000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018The words, most of the time, were there, but we had no common understanding of their deeper meanings\u2019: Lauren Collins in Paris.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018The words, most of the time, were there, but we had no common understanding of their deeper meanings\u2019: Lauren Collins in Paris.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ed Alcock/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>One day, Olivier told me that speaking to me in English felt like \u201ctouching me with gloves\u201d. We got married, we moved to francophone Switzerland, and I told my mother-in-law \u2013intending to say I\u2019d \u201caccepted delivery\u201d\u2013 that I\u2019d given birth to a Nespresso machine. (I felt better about that when I read, recently, that the Pope, mixing up \u201ccazzo\u201d and \u201ccaso,\u201d <a href=\"http://nypost.com/2014/03/03/pope-drops-f-bomb-during-vatican-blessing/\">accidentally dropped the f-word during a recent mass</a>.) Eventually, it became clear I was going to have to learn French.</p> <p>At first, the language, its liaisons slurring words together like the ramblings of a drunk, was incomprehensible. But, slowly, I began to hear the difference between \u201cle\u201d and \u201cla\u201d and \u201cles\u201d, and another world opened up. \u201cAvocat\u201d \u2013 a lawyer, but also an avocado. \u201cGerber\u201d \u2013 has there ever been a better word for \u201cto vomit\u201d? Even the subjunctive, repellent at first, came to seem an indispensable flavour, the hint of orange-blossom in the madeleine. I miss it, now, in English. French\u2019s dramatic self-assured adjectives \u2013 \u201cformidable\u201d, \u201cex\u00e9crable\u201d\u2013 seemed to me the Sasha Fierce to English\u2019s Beyonc\u00e9.</p> <p>As I got to know French, I got to know Olivier. I began to appreciate his subtlety, his restraint, his aversion to hyperbole or overpromise. If he\u2019d taken off a pair of gloves, I\u2019d put on prescription glasses. I\u2019m with the late American linguist <a href=\"http://ling.yale.edu/history/benjamin-lee-whorf\">Benjamin Lee Whorf</a>, whose once-discredited belief that language influences thought has lately been revived in the scientific establishment. \u201cWe dissect nature along lines laid down by our native languages,\u201d he wrote. \u201cLanguage is not simply a reporting device for experience but a defining framework for it.\u201d</p> <p>The other day I was talking to a French-speaking friend, who dropped the word \u201cracli\u201d into conversation. I\u2019d never heard it. I went home and repeated it to Olivier, eager to show off my new acquisition. It turned out he\u2019d never heard it either. \u201cRacli\u201d \u2013 borrowed from the Romani language, a newly popular slang word referring to what, in Olivier\u2019s adolescence, was more often called a meuf or a nana \u2013 a chick, a girl. Another entry in our dictionary, a labour of learning forever regenerating, like laundry; a conversation-stopper, and starter, not because I\u2019m foreign but because we\u2019re old.</p> <p>Learning French, I came to see us not as the linguistic freak show I once thought we were, but as an exaggerated version of every couple.

  "<p>It\u2019s the Conservative party conference this week and City types are agog to hear whether Theresa May will give more details about her <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/25/theresa-may-reform-capitalism-philip-green-bhs-scandal\" title=\"\">pledge to reform capitalism</a>. In July, in what was meant to be one of many campaign speeches for the Tory leadership, May attacked runaway executive pay and said she would put workers and consumers on boards to make companies more accountable to society. Later that day, Andrea Leadsom pulled out of the race and May became prime minister, with her remarks echoing in the ears of fund managers and bosses.</p> <p>City lobbyists are hoping for vague proposals that they can influence during consultation, but May seems committed to worker representation. Opponents say it will upset the balance of boardrooms because directors are meant to be responsible for the whole company and not for a particular group. They suggest instead giving a board member responsibility for communicating with workers.</p> <p>Others, such as Hermes Investment Management, think such objections are surmountable and that a worker on the board is a good idea. First Group, the bus and train operator, already has an employee board member and Mike Ashley has promised one at Sports Direct, hitherto a pariah of corporate governance. The business establishment may have to lump it.</p> <h2>Tesco hopes \u2018Redmere\u2019 will keep it in the black</h2> <p>It\u2019s just over two years since Dave Lewis, who had just taken over as Tesco\u2019s chief executive, revealed there was a \u00a3250m hole in the company\u2019s accounts. Tesco had been overstating revenue paid to it by its suppliers before a whistleblower alerted the company lawyer in September 2014.</p> <p>The scandal was one of a series of profit warnings that showed the terrible state the once mighty retailer had got itself into. Lewis, an ex-Unilever man who had never run a retailer, must have wondered what he had done in taking the job.</p> <p>Things have certainly looked up since then but it\u2019s been a slog, as Lewis has closed and cancelled stores, reduced prices and cut jobs. We\u2019ll get a clearer picture on Wednesday when Tesco reports its first-half results.</p> <p>One thing to look out for will be how Tesco\u2019s fictitious farm brands such as Redmere and Boswell are doing. Over the summer the National Farmers Union criticised Tesco for misleading customers by using English names for non-existent farms when products are often produced abroad. Nevertheless, Tesco hopes the brands will help it fight back in the battle with the German discounters Aldi and Lidl.</p> <h2>EasyJet has almost never had it so difficult</h2> <p>These are difficult times for easyJet. The budget airline has been buffeted by turbulence over the last year as terrorist attacks in Egypt, Paris, Brussels and Nice have deterred people from flying. Add in air traffic control strikes, a failed coup in Turkey and Brexit and it\u2019s easy to see why Carolyn McCall, the chief executive, says the company faces one of the most difficult periods in its 21-year history.</p> <p>McCall is adamant that flying is a part of everyday life, but after every incident such as the Brussels bombings consumer demand falls sharply and recovers slowly. Investors are also nervous: the company\u2019s shares hit a record high of \u00a319.15 in April 2015 but have plunged to little more than \u00a310. McCall will no doubt try to reassure the City on Tuesday when easyJet publishes a trading update.</p> <p>Brexit is a worry. Not only has the pound\u2019s fall pushed up the cost of fuel (priced in dollars), but easyJet relies on UK travellers for about half its revenue and a weaker pound could put people off trips to Europe.

  "<p>The UK\u2019s submission for the foreign language film award at the forthcoming Oscars is this Farsi chiller that seems at first glance to share some of the supernatural/ sociopolitical concerns of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/may/24/a-girl-walks-home-alone-at-night-review-mark-kermode\"><em>A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night</em></a>. Yet despite their shared language and genre, this ghostly gem owes less to Ana Lily Amirpour\u2019s monochrome vampire fable than to the Spanish civil war fantasy of Guillermo del Toro\u2019s <em>The Devil\u2019s Backbone</em> and the maternal sacrifice of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2003/jun/08/features.review\">Hideo Nakata\u2019s <em>Dark Water</em></a><em>.</em></p> <p>Focusing on a mother and daughter besieged by forces both worldly and otherwise in a Tehran apartment block, <em>Under the Shadow</em> presents a gripping portrait of an independently spirited woman shackled by sharia law who becomes more scared of the demonic forces tormenting her daughter than of the lashes threatened by her rulers or of fire falling from the sky. A very impressive feature debut by Iran-born, London-based film-maker Babak Anvari, this is thoughtful, provocative and increasingly scary fare, which succeeds equally as feminist fable, fractured family drama and full-on fright-fest.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_ATX4C8Pmw\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/G_ATX4C8Pmw?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Watch the trailer for Under the Shadow.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Set in 1988, with Jordan doubling for Iran, <em>Under the Shadow</em> finds its characters sheltering from the fallout of the Iran-Iraq war, bombs and sirens intermingling with ever more alarming news reports in the threatening mosaic of background noise. Barred from resuming her medical studies because of her formerly outspoken politics (\u201cI was naive\u2026 I wanted change\u201d), Narges Rashidi\u2019s Shideh becomes more isolated than ever when husband Iraj (Bobby Naderi) is called away for military service. Behind closed doors, Shideh works out to Jane Fonda videos, but her VCR is a secret that must remain under wraps.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>From the amplified snap of a toaster to the crash of a broken window, Anvari knows how to make us jump</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>When an unexploded missile pierces the roof of their building, Shideh\u2019s daughter, Dorsa (Avin Manshadi), is convinced that malevolent \u201cdjinn\u201d spirits are out to get them, an idea fomented by a haunted young neighbour whose parents have died in the conflict. Are Dorsa\u2019s night terrors a fanciful reaction to the down-to-earth horrors of life during wartime? Or is Shideh somehow projecting her own fears and frustrations on to her impressionable, traumatised daughter?</p> <p>There\u2019s more than a touch of Jennifer Kent\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/oct/26/the-babadook-review-mark-kermode-brilliant-chiller\"><em>The Babadook</em></a> in the way Anvari cleverly conflates Iraj\u2019s complaints about Shideh\u2019s maternal shortcomings with the spooky occurrences that now threaten to tear mother and daughter apart. While cinematographer Kit Fraser shoots early domestic scenes in neorealist handheld style, the visual aesthetic becomes more angular and expressionist as Shideh descends into a sleepwalking nightmare, replete with skin-crawling flashes of a wraith-like figure wrapped in a significantly patterned spectral chador. A disorienting shot of Shideh lying in bed with the camera tilted at 90 degrees seems to provide a literal tipping point, a moment when waking life becomes a dream. Yet as with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/dec/28/roman-polanski-films-retrospective\">Polanski</a>\u2019s <em>Repulsion</em> and <em>The Tenant</em> (which Anvari has cited as influential), such boundaries remain fluid and we are never dispossessed of the notion that Dorsa really is the target of wandering spirits, plotting to steal her away like her beloved doll, Kimia.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d662f621f5e3e74b1125cf6e3971969bf52c2e5a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d662f621f5e3e74b1125cf6e3971969bf52c2e5a/195_0_2267_1361/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Avin Manshadi as Dorsa in Under the Shadow.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Avin Manshadi as Dorsa in Under the Shadow.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Photograph: Everett/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Reading from Gholam-Hossein Sa\u2019edi\u2019s descriptions of the \u201cpeople of the air\u201d, Shideh learns that \u201cwhere there is fear and anxiety, the \u2018winds\u2019 blow\u201d and all those elements are present in abundance here.

As the groans of the apartment block intermingle with the omnipresent cacophony of war, these cries and whispers keep us wondering whether the vortex of sound spiralling around our central couple comes from their home or their heads. Even when the drama strays into the declarative, carnivalesque territory of <em>Poltergeist</em>, Anvari keeps bringing us back to those ambiguously eerie rumbles that lurk in the very foundations of his movie.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/sep/29/terror-in-tehran-babak-anvari-under-the-shadow\">Terror in Tehran: Under the Shadow and the politics of horror</a> </p> </aside>  <p>None of which is not to suggest that this whip-smart writer-director is above saying \u201cBoo!\u201d to his audience.

  "<p>\u2018Why are you going to the Labour conference?\u201d asked the Liverpool taxi driver.</p> <p>\u201cWell, I\u2019ve got used to attending funerals this year.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, but not suicides, I bet!\u201d</p> <p>This somehow captured the mood of a conference where the enthusiasm of the \u201cCorbynistas\u201d contrasted with the unutterable gloom and dire forebodings of such traditional Labour party supporters and MPs as had bothered to turn up at all.</p> <p>Here we have a government that is crying out to be challenged on so many fronts, yet the main occupation of the Labour party has been to oppose itself.</p> <p>I confess that, in common with not a few other observers, I could not quite take the atmosphere of the conference and beat a hasty retreat on the Tuesday. Thus it came about that I found myself watching Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s speech on television back at home.</p> <p>It received an execrable reception in the media \u2013 as did shadow chancellor John McDonnell\u2019s speech the day before \u2013 with cries amounting to \u201csame old story: tax rises, more public spending, masses of borrowing\u201d etc.</p> <p>Now, I fully understand the wrath of the anti-Corbynistas over the widely reported bullying tactics of Corbyn and McDonnell\u2019s \u201cbovver boys\u201d, and the antipathy towards a \u201cTrotskyite takeover\u201d of the party. When I said to one senior former cabinet minister \u201cit\u2019s just like the early 1980s\u201d, he replied: \u2018\u2018It\u2019s worse than that. At least then we were in control.\u201d</p> <p>But there were some good things in the speeches of both Corbyn and McDonnell: they are obviously leading with their chins to boast about \u201csocialism\u201d, even though this word that frightens the media was used in the past by Roy Hattersley, John Smith and even Tony Blair.</p> <p>Once upon a time socialism was closely associated with communism, and the British left had some embarrassing moments with this over the years. Way back in the 1950s, Tony Crosland wrote an influential book entitled <em>The Future of Socialism</em> and phrases such as \u201cdemocratic socialism\u201d became widely used, and the \u201cmixed economy\u201d became all the rage.</p> <p>After the fall of the Berlin wall in 1989, and the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, many people, including me, were concerned about the triumphalism that followed, as we saw an acceleration of the deregulation that had begun with Reagan and Thatcher, and the obeisance to rampant markets.</p> <p>Then came the global financial crash, the impact of which we are still experiencing \u2013 with the ultimate irony that the prospect of a massive fine on Deutsche Bank is even being talked about as a last straw that might precipitate the next financial crisis!</p> <p>Now, while I can understand the despair of the parliamentary Labour party, I wonder whether the rightwing press that excoriates Corbyn and McDonnell are aware of the wider debate that is going on.</p> <p>We now have the International Monetary Fund and, less surprisingly, the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, bemoaning the abysmal state of the post-crisis economy and crying out for governments to intervene to boost economic demand. It is now widely accepted that monetary policy has reached its limits, and may, via the effect on savers, be having a perverse impact on attempts to boost demand.</p> <p>Too many corporations are sitting on cash piles and not investing. The concentration of so much of the increment in national income in the hands of the top 5% means they themselves have plenty to spend but the sum total is not enough to boost world demand and ward off mounting fears of another recession.</p> <p>Corbyn and McDonnell call for increased government borrowing, at negligible rates of interest, to boost infrastructure. So do the most orthodox central banking institutions, such as the Bank for International Settlements, based in Basel. The reaction to their calls has been little short of hysterical in some places.</p> <p>They should not be excoriated for this. More to the point are the widespread concerns that for other reasons, not least their abysmal poll ratings, they are not electable.</p> <p>Anyway, they should be going for this government, which has lamely accepted the wish of 37% of the electorate to leave the EU (ie, although 52% of those who voted were for Out, only 37% of those eligible to vote were, God forgive them, Brexiters).</p> <p>Which brings us to the recent speech by George Osborne in Chicago. He said the British people <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/23/george-osborne-brexit-won-majority-hard-brexit-did-not\" title=\"\">had not voted for a \u201chard Brexit\u201d</a>. He was right. Only 37% voted for a hard Brexit. For what does leaving the EU mean other than a hard Brexit? And if you allow for all those under-18s who are keener on Europe than their grandparents, the proportion of population that wish to leave the EU must be closer to 25%.</p> <p>I bet that a fair proportion of the 37% did not appreciate the implications of what they were doing. The vultures are already descending, in the shape of foreign embassies in London approaching financial institutions and offering \u201chelpful\u201d advice about moving their operations elsewhere. And <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/30/nissan-hard-brexit-compensation-new-uk-investment-tariffs\" title=\"\">Nissan is just one of many multinationals</a> considering the impact of Brexit on their future investment plans.</p> <p>How can a nation such as ours be so stupid? To coin a phrase, we need our country back. Our sovereign parliament must veto this absurd and self-destructive policy.</p>",

Discussing the scene in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45OsKkHhv90\" title=\"\"><em>The History Boys</em></a> where sixth-former Dakin seduces Irwin, his teacher, Bennett remarks that \u201cwhere sex is concerned directors think I\u2019m not that sort of writer\u2026 and so don\u2019t entirely trust what I\u2019ve written\u201d. What to do? Actually, he\u2019s written about sex quite a bit \u2013the short book, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lfSHIF9HZk\" title=\"\"><em>Smut</em></a>, written during the timescale of these diaries, consists of \u201ctwo unseemly stories\u201d \u2013 but his sex is always realistic and within character, whether repressed, comic, or vicious. There is no sex at all in these diaries and not much lust, carnal or otherwise. About the cast of <em>The History Boys</em> he comments that they \u201cplay football against the playground wall with an openness and abandon I have never managed in all my life\u201d.</p> <p>This inhibition is a recurring theme; sometimes he regrets it, sometimes it\u2019s embraced. But we would be wrong to deem Bennett a teddy bear. There is righteous anger here. He writes excoriatingly about Tony Blair, Jeremy Hunt, Rupert Murdoch. He is appalled by the Met\u2019s shooting of \u201cMr de Menezes\u201d. He calls Margaret Thatcher \u201ca mirthless bully\u201d, who \u201cshould have been buried, as once upon a time monarchs used to be, in the dead of night\u201d. In 2015, a couple of days after the general election, he is upset by a woman who says casually to him that all politicians are the same. \u201cI hear myself as very rarely shouting at the top of my voice, \u2018No, they are not all the same. This lot are self-seeking liars, the cabinet included, and we\u2019re landed with them for another five years.\u2019\u201d He mentions that if he were a member of the Labour party, he would vote for Jeremy Corbyn, \u201cif only out of hope that the better part of salvation lies not in electoral calculation but the aspirations of the people\u201d.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lfSHIF9HZk\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2lfSHIF9HZk?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Alan Bennett reads from Smut</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Tolerant of flaws in people who deserve tolerance, he sees the humanity in traitors, the brutality of the elite.

He reports it and the police immediately inform the <em>Daily Mail</em>). He loathes public schools. He loves libraries. None of this is surprising, really, but is it cosy? I think not. If we find Alan Bennett comforting, the comfort comes partly from his morals, which are robust and uncosy, though of another age.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Bennett is prolific, but never sloppy. His sentences are always beautiful</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Unlike some writers, Bennett doesn\u2019t give much away about what the loftier might call his \u201cprocess\u201d. Occasionally, there is a mention of too many notes taken, too much actual writing. He gives away boxes and boxes of his unpublished prose to the Bodleian Library in Oxford. He does note the odd structural breakthrough and points out flaws in his earlier work, but pointedly he also says this: \u201cWriters feel threatened by biography, their lives as they see it are what they have put in the shop window, the rest \u2013 what\u2019s in the back place \u2013 their business.\u201d Not all of Bennett\u2019s life is on display or for sale, even in his diaries. He withholds, he edits. He knows what he is doing.</p> <p>(Actually, I assume that this is not merely due to self-preservation. A polite man, Bennett must also be motivated by good manners. He doesn\u2019t want to bore his readers with a long list of aches and pains, of tedious medical work, of the arguments he must surely occasionally have with Rupert, his partner. At one point he has a seven-hour operation, but restricts himself to commenting on the nurses\u2019 uniforms. He mentions his deafness, but mostly for the consequent misunderstanding and jokes.)</p> <p>He is funny, sometimes screamingly so. Some of the diary entries are short, just gags really, shafts of light to leaven the everyday. \u201cIn Dorset, passing a signpost: \u2018That\u2019s where Hardy\u2019s buried.\u2019 \u2018Really?\u2019 Pause. \u2018Laurel\u2019s in Ulverston.\u2019\u201d \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to be as bald as that. You\u2019d never know when to stop washing your face.\u201d \u201cWe are in the car when a pretty girl crosses too slowly. If I\u2019d been bold (or insane) I\u2019d have wound the window down and said \u2018Listen. We\u2019re nancies. Big tits mean nothing to us.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Although it\u2019s his diaries that make up most of this book, Bennett\u2019s other works aren\u2019t afterthoughts. They represent just a small part of what he has been up to, aside from his diligent diarising, his regular articles for the <em>London Review of Books</em>, his books and his plays (during this decade alone: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/sep/30/fiction\" title=\"\"><em>The Uncommon Reader</em></a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/mar/18/smut-unseemly-stories-alan-bennett-review\" title=\"\"><em>Smut</em></a><em>,</em> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2009/nov/22/the-habit-of-art-bennett\" title=\"\"><em>The Habit of Art</em></a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2012/nov/08/people-alan-bennett-lyttelton\" title=\"\"><em>People</em></a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2012/dec/17/hymn-cocktail-sticks-review\" title=\"\"><em>Hymn</em> and <em>Cocktail Sticks</em></a>). Bennett is prolific, but never sloppy. His sentences are always beautiful. So we have a short entry covering the making of the film of <em>The History Boys</em>, the introduction to <em>The Habit of Art</em> (which I loved) and other plays. The two screenplays included are <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b04j9z7c\" title=\"\"><em>Denmark Hill</em></a>, a radio play written in 1972 and performed on Radio 4 in 2014, and an old film script, <em>The Hand of God</em>. The latter is quite bonkers really, an art whodunnit, an examination of class that also says (as in <em>The Habit of Art</em>) that it\u2019s the art that matters, that the characters are just barrow boys moving it around. There is, you note, a bit of bedroom shenanigans.</p> <p>This book is a pleasure, though, yes, a temperate one. Is it strange to read such even-tempered diaries? If there\u2019s no sex, do we desire more action? Bennett\u2019s life is not commonplace \u2013 too many famous friends and invitations to speak at venerable institutions \u2013 but it isn\u2019t dramatic. He and Rupert go to Yorkshire a lot. They walk around churches and National Trust properties. They have their sandwiches in scenic spots. He goes into detail \u2013 a bit too much detail for me, though other readers may well love it \u2013 about medieval glass, church pews, alabaster monuments.</p> <p>Deaths occur: he is mostly unsentimental. His ex-lover, Anne Davies, dies (he refers to her as \u201cmy friend\u201d), but he says little, other than to commend her son\u2019s impromptu speech. At such times, his reticence can seem chilly, though he is kind about Anne at other moments and earlier makes the quiet point about her that \u201cthe highest form of courage there is, it seems to me, to take away the burden of concern from friends and family\u2026 so that they can go away feeling better about you\u201d. You have a strong sense, sometimes, that he is doing the same.</p> <p>In short, then, don\u2019t read this enormous tome for thrills. This is a life being lived, some of it privately, and we all know what life can be like. Same-same, routine, ordinary. But there is a joy in gentleness, in emotions kept in check, in kindness and domesticity, in nature, in history, in hilarious detail. Bennett knows his age (81 in 2015) and he knows what this means. He is keeping on keeping on \u2013 with his writing, his particular way of going about things, his non-stabbing of Judi Dench \u2013 because that is what he does. Long may it continue.</p> <p><em>Keeping on Keeping on is published by Profile (\u00a325). </em><a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/keeping-on-keeping-on.html?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\" title=\"\"><em>Click here to buy it for \u00a320.50</em></a></p>",
  "<p><strong>One of the easiest ways of measuring your personality is simply to ask which kinds of TV, films, and books and magazines do you enjoy.

  "<p>If tiredness was measured in duvet togs I\u2019d currently be at a winter-weight 13.5; my eyes made of crisps, my body a Frube. It\u2019s been a long week, with a sick child who came and slept with me, her rolling body falling out of bed and on to the floor with a clinical thump every time I fell asleep. I tell you this knowing exactly how boring it is to talk about tiredness. Talking about sleep is as dull as talking about how much you drank the night before; as talking about the Labour party with a politics bro in a crowded bar. A brolitician. And yet, here I am.</p> <p>I\u2019m talking about it because I can, and I can because you are. Sleep, how little, how much, is a conversation you will hear in every office, every park. Whereas once it was a mark of honour to exist on only a couple of hours\u2019 sleep (it meant you were working harder), now the opposite is true. To boast of eight hours is to explain that you have invested in your body, a temple of wellness, to optimise the day.</p> <p>Today, sleep is fetishised, marketed, precious and gold. <a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/\">Kickstarter</a> is swollen with innovative pillows. Mattresses, once the most bovine of purchases, have become almost exciting. A glut of new online companies deliver them to your door in tiny little boxes, and they inflate and unfurl in your bedroom like indoor fireworks. The companies advertise on podcasts and social media as if they\u2019re selling new space beds for millennials, rather than the same sandwiches of foam and old skin we\u2019ve slept on forever.</p> <p>There\u2019s one particular mattress advert on the Tube that I often find myself waiting in front of. Its imagery seems designed to infuriate. I realise they\u2019re aimed at the young. People for whom sleep is still something you have enough energy to feel you can control: there\u2019s an illustration of a mattress for \u201csneakerheads\u201d with a man asleep, covered in shoes; a mattress for \u201cpolitical animals\u201d with a donkey sparring with an elephant on the bed. If cigarette ads rely on the idea that smoking makes you look cool, and chocolate ads on the idea that it is sensual, then are today\u2019s mattress ads selling the idea that sleep makes you a better banter-merchant?</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>One way we are sold sleep is through phone apps you take to bed</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But can good sleep really be bought? In direct opposition to the traditional advice to remove all screens and blue light from the bedroom (along with advice to drink water, to keep cool, be a cat), one of the ways we are sold sleep is through phone apps you take to bed. By monitoring your REM and snoring in a more efficient way than your ex ever did, you can quantify your sleep and then, obviously, use it to compete with your peers (the point of all apps at all times).</p> <p>There\u2019s something very sinister to me about turning our every worry into data, about \u201cwearables\u201d \u2013 the word itself is Orwellian. And, yeah, I\u2019m sure there are some people who sleep longer after using an app and yet more who feel like they do because, having downloaded a tool, they believe they have conquered it. But, like the recent study that showed fitness trackers don\u2019t work (instead often helping their users to put on weight, whoopsie), surely there are more sleep-app customers who pay their money and then just\u2026 lie there, waiting.</p> <p>Like weight-loss diets, isn\u2019t the simplest, oldest, most boring solution to good sleep the only one truly proven to work? Less nicotine, caffeine, alcohol, more exercise, a regular routine \u2013 things that we wouldn\u2019t have needed to emulate when our days were spent away from a fixed desk in a strip-lit room. Modern life is brilliant, but for all it gives, it takes away, too.</p> <p>The sick child made me sick, and I sit in bed with my laptop coughing in a tone that has kept my whole flat, carpeted with discarded tissues, awake for two long nights. I sleep until I wake myself up with this throaty racket and then I lie here trying to remember how a normal person\u2019s breathing sounds when they sleep. I consider other times I\u2019ve lain wide awake at dawn, either worried or mothering or both, and for all the anxiety that I\u2019ll never sleep again, I tell myself I have, many times.</p> <p>As the sleep industry gathers around our beds like a long-lost nephew angling for inheritance, I remember that even without technology, sleep comes. It always does. Perhaps I won\u2019t get all the jokes tomorrow, but soon I will feel better. Losing sleep needn\u2019t be anything to lose sleep over.</p> <p>Email Eva at <a href=\"mailto:e.wiseman@observer.co.uk\">e.wiseman@observer.co.uk</a> or follow her on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/EvaWiseman?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">@EvaWiseman</a></p>",
  "<p>Outrage is the only conceivable reaction to the devastation wrought on Aleppo. A relentless aerial assault by Syrian and Russian forces has targeted hospitals, the water supply and facilities of White Helmet emergency workers, let alone the UN humanitarian convoy that was struck on 19 September. The images, of corpses pulled out from beneath collapsed masonry, to a bloodied underground emergency room floor, are simply appalling.</p> <p>Disbelief follows. How, in this day and age, could such tragedy come to pass? The use of airpower to devastate a city had seemingly been consigned to history. Where on earth, in the 21st century, are the legal mechanisms and the accountability to halt such devastation? The powerlessness of the UN and its associated bodies is palpable. This is especially the case when it is confronted with regimes such as those of Bashar al-Assad and Vladimir Putin that feel no compunction over a scorched-earth response to insurgency and do so with calculation.</p> <p>It is sickening to think of strategy in these contexts, but strategy there is. The collective punishment of a populace has its own grim legacy in western historical memory. In the Second World War, Dresden and Coventry were but two of the cities reduced to rubble by \u201carea bombing\u201d. In postwar Britain, a residual guilt hung over the veneration of Arthur \u201cBomber\u201d Harris and his orchestration of the strategic bombing of German cities. As <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/apr/13/usa.kurtvonnegut\" title=\"\">Kurt Vonnegut</a> hauntingly wrote in <em>Slaughterhouse Five</em>: \u201cDresden was like the moon now, nothing but minerals. The stones were hot. Everybody else in the neighbourhood was dead.\u201d</p> <p>With Assad and Putin, each has his own precedent. Hafez al-Assad&#xa0;brutally defeated&#xa0;the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/from-the-archive-blog/2011/aug/01/hama-syria-massacre-1982-archive\" title=\"\">Hama uprising in&#xa0;1982</a>. Tens of thousands of people were killed and the regime shored up for his son, Bashar. And Putin\u2019s response to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/1999/dec/16/russia.chechnya\" title=\"\">Chechnya\u2019s rebellion reduced Grozny to rubble</a>. Indeed, he used this victory to cement his authority in the early 2000s.</p> <p>Pushing for a punishing military victory has more recent precedent elsewhere. Sri Lanka mounted a merciless final assault on the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/apr/05/sri-lanka-forces-tamil-tigers\" title=\"\">Tamil Tiger insurgency in 2009</a>. President Mahinda Rajapaksa explicitly resisted calls for ceasefire, fearing it would grant respite to the rebels. His regime escaped with only international censure. A damming <a href=\"http://www.un.org/News/dh/infocus/Sri_Lanka/POE_Report_Full.pdf\" title=\"\">UN investigation</a> estimated that 40,000 people had perished, many by indiscriminate artillery fire used to pin down Tigers. But, with some diplomatic cover from China, the Sri Lankan regime emerged to claim to have pacified its island.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Western countries are complaining from the sidelines. Norms and laws have to be enforced, sometimes by force</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In each instance, proportionality of force seems to have been dispensed with. The common denominator with Aleppo is an intermixing of civilians and rebels. To prise one from the other would be a painstaking military undertaking. Insurgency repeatedly presents governments with a manifestation of this challenge. Urban settings add their own complexity. As Russia\u2019s army discovered in Grozny\u2019s rubble-strewn streets, collapsed buildings provide effective cover for defending forces. Better to blockade and pummel from afar, if the sanctity of human life is not a concern.</p> <p>None of this reasoning is offered as justification, only as explanation.</p> <p>Hersch Lauterpacht, a UN international lawyer in the 1950s, delivered a famous lament. \u201cIf international law is at the vanishing point of law, then the law of war is, perhaps, even more conspicuously, at the vanishing point of international law.\u201d This remains true. No matter the progress made in establishing the International Criminal Court, in prohibiting indiscriminate armaments of certain kinds and in diffusing norms like \u201cR2P\u201d (the responsibility of all governments to protect its civilians). Lauterpacht\u2019s noble scepticism reverberates through the ages, with Syria in mind.</p> <p>Power still rules the day. The problem is that the US has barely opted to use it. In the UN security council last week, US ambassador <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/25/russia-accused-war-crimes-syria-un-security-council-aleppo\" title=\"\">Samantha Power\u2019</a>s indictment of the bombing of Aleppo was clear. \u201cWhat Russia is sponsoring is not counter-terrorism, it is barbarism. Instead of pursuing peace, Russia and Assad make war. Instead of helping get aid to civilians, Russia and Assad are bombing the humanitarian convoys, hospitals and first responders are trying to keep people alive.\u201d Matthew Rycroft, the UK\u2019s permanent representative to the UN, called out the Russians and Syrians as colluding in \u201cwar crimes\u201d.</p> <p>Herein lies the problem: western countries are complaining from the sidelines. Norms and laws have to be enforced, sometimes by force. It seems oxymoronic to prescribe yet more war as the solution. But frustration with Barack Obama\u2019s passive stance over Syria bubbled over in the US state department in June. In a joint letter, 51 serving diplomats wrote: \u201cNone of us sees merit in a large-scale US invasion of Syria\u2026 But we do see merit in a more militarily assertive US role\u2026 based on the judicious use of standoff and air weapons, which would undergird and drive a more focused and hardnosed US-led diplomatic process.\u201d Military force, reasoned the frustrated officials, could \u201cenforce the cessation of hostilities\u201d.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2016/oct/01/syrian-civil-defence-volunteer-weeps-are-rescuing-baby-from-rubble-in-aleppo-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/55f6f\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2766732\"            data-video-name=\"Syrian Civil Defence volunteer weeps after rescuing baby from rubble in Idlib \u2013\u00a0video\"            data-video-provider=\"AP\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57ef8fcee4b05962fdf49cbe\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/10/01/161001whitehelmet_h264_publish.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11733750&amp;format=video/m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11733750&amp;format=video/webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2016/oct/01/syrian-civil-defence-volunteer-weeps-are-rescuing-baby-from-rubble-in-aleppo-video\">Syrian Civil Defence volunteer weeps after rescuing baby from rubble in Aleppo \u2013 video</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>When Syria\u2019s civil war began in 2011, it was initially framed in US policy circles as part of the wider wave of Arab Spring protests. George W Bush and US-led wars of regime change in Iraq and Afghanistan had tarnished America\u2019s self-confidence. Obama, in seeking to restore international faith in the US as a moral actor, promised to end his predecessor\u2019s era of waging war in Muslim countries. As Assad chose to stand and fight the Syrian rebellion, and began courting Iranian and Russian help, Obama placed the weight of his response in an international diplomatic process. The one other strand of \u201chard power\u201d policy \u2013 the US arming of moderate Syrian rebels \u2013 would turn to farce. A book by a disgruntled CIA case officer, Doug Laux, claims that plans to depose Assad were quashed by the White House. Although his memoir is in part redacted, the failing battlefield fortunes of US-armed rebels seemed to convey their irrelevance. In their stead, extremist Islamist factions, many with support from Gulf-based benefactors, would fill the void.</p> <p>It is remarkable how many attempts were made by outsiders to bring some semblance of control to Syria\u2019s spiralling war. These included abortive early attempts by the Arab League, before multilateral efforts moved to the UN level, including tenures by both Kofi Annan and Lakhdar Brahimi in the role of UN-Arab League envoy. An initiative by Finland\u2019s Martti Ahtisaari attempted \u2013 but failed \u2013 to smooth over the US-Russo spat over the ultimate fate of Assad\u2019s presidency. In the end, everything hinges on dealings between the Kremlin and Washington and on John Kerry\u2019s \u201ccessation of hostility\u201d agreements.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/01/-syriaairstrikes-major-offensive-against-rebel-held-areas-of-aleppo\">Syria: Aleppo hospital hit by barrel bombs and cluster bombs, reports say</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But as Russia demonstrated in Ukraine, it is adept as using diplomacy as a smokescreen for war. In February 2015, the Kremlin backed an addendum to the Minsk Agreement to end Ukraine\u2019s war at the exact moment it was also supporting a separatist offensive to capture the strategic town of Debaltseve. As Ukraine\u2019s war steadied into a little-reported drip feed of artillery exchanges over a static frontline, Russian forces deployed \u2013 this time overtly \u2013 into Syria in September 2015. Now, Russia and Syria are assuming they will retain a freedom to act with impunity, at least until there is a new White House resident.</p> <p>All of which renders ordinary Syrians as pawns in a blood-drenched game of geopolitical chess. There is no military force powerful enough, nor backed by the right political consensus, to have halted Assad\u2019s foreign-backed army. Perhaps back in the first few years of the war, a coalition of US, UK, Turkish and even Saudi Arabian forces could have toppled Assad. But ever since the Islamic State subverted Syria\u2019s (and Iraq\u2019s) instability to its own ends in 2014, western concern has fixated on fighting the internationally focused jihadis.</p> <p>Indeed, for all the opprobrium heaped on Russia, one must be mindful of US priorities, too. The February 2016 cessation of hostilities agreement, the diplomatic effort that tried to ringfence the war against Isis and the al-Qaida affiliated Jabhat al-Nusra (a group that has since attempted to shed its al-Qaida branding). In other words, the US tried to de-escalate one war in Syria (between Assad and the rebels) while escalating another (the international campaign against jihadis).</p> <p>Aleppo\u2019s fate has also not been helped by Turkey falling into internal conflict following its attempted coup. Gaziantep, the Turkish city less than 100km north of Aleppo, has become something of a way station for international relief efforts into Syria. In its assault on Aleppo, Syrian forces have been especially keen to sever this support artery, which they say allows Turkish-backed Syrian rebels to remain well supplied.</p> <p>All of this has rendered the humanitarian effort especially fraught. Those brave souls who chose to venture out of Turkey to deliver direct assistance to besieged Syrians have met terrible fates. There have been those killed in the bombed, humanitarian convoys. And the story of British doctor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/18/syria-foreignpolicy\" title=\"\">Abbas Khan</a>, who perished in a Syrian prison in 2013, having crossed the border to use his skills to save lives, is but one human tragedy against a backdrop of immense suffering.</p> <p>History will judge Syria\u2019s descent into a hydra-headed war as a stain on the world\u2019s conscience. The lives lost, the sectarian hatreds ignited and the instability it has exported make it painful to wonder how we got here. And, in the apparent absence of an international order capable of halting such crises, it may well come to be posed in other wars elsewhere.</p> <p><em>Dr Samir Puri, lecturer in war studies, King\u2019s College London, is the author of </em>Fighting and Negotiating with Armed Groups</p> <p><em>\u2022</em> Comments will be opened later today</p>",

It is the second most common form of dementia after Alzheimer\u2019s, with which it shares many symptoms, and can be misdiagnosed as Parkinson\u2019s disease.</p> <p>In October 2013, on the couple\u2019s second wedding anniversary, Williams experienced gut discomfort, and fear and anxiety which \u201cskyrocketed to a point that was alarming\u201d, Schneider Williams wrote.</p> <p>He had already been experiencing various physical ailments, which had been intermittent and which the couple and doctors had believed were unrelated. By December he would suffer from increasing levels of \u201cparanoia, delusions and looping, insomnia, memory, and high cortisol levels\u201d.</p> <p>After his death doctors found that a high concentration of Lewy bodies in his brain\u2019s amygdala had caused the acute paranoia and \u201cout-of-character emotional responses\u201d.</p> <p>Schneider Williams described it as \u201cchemical warfare in his brain\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cHow I wish he could have known why he was struggling, that it was not a weakness in his heart, spirit, or character,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Over the following months Williams suffered from panic attacks and memory loss, struggling to remember lines during the shooting of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/dec/18/night-at-the-museum-secret-of-the-tomb-review\">Night at the Museum 3</a>.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>He kept saying, \u2018I just want to reboot my brain\u2019.</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>His mental state declined, and Schneider Williams found herself increasingly unable to reassure his anxieties and insecurities.</p> <p>\u201cRobin was losing his mind and he was aware of it. Can you imagine the pain he felt as he experienced himself disintegrating? And not from something he would ever know the name of, or understand?

That spectrum is based on something they share in common: the presence of Lewy bodies \u2013 the unnatural clumping of the normal protein, a-synuclein, within brain neurons,\u201d she said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/dec/18/night-at-the-museum-secret-of-the-tomb-review\">Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb review</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Schneider Williams said four doctors examined her husband\u2019s autopsy report and final two years of medical records and they \u201cindicated his was one of the worst pathologies they had seen\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cHe had about 40% loss of dopamine neurons and almost no neurons were free of Lewy bodies throughout the entire brain and brainstem.\u201d</p> <p>She said the medical team had been on the right track in diagnosing and treating Williams before he died, but she would never know if that would have made a difference.</p> <p>\u201cI am not convinced that the knowledge would have done much more than prolong Robin\u2019s agony while he would surely become one of the most famous test subjects of new medicines and ongoing medical trials,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cEven if we experienced some level of comfort in knowing the name, and fleeting hope from temporary comfort with medications, the terrorist was still going to kill him.\u201d</p> <p>Schneider Williams, who was last week appointed to the American Brain Foundation\u2019s board of directors, said she wrote the essay to increase neurologists\u2019 understanding of patients and caregivers and to \u201cadd a few more faces\u201d to the reasons they conduct research.</p> <p><em>\u2022 In the US, the National Suicide Prevention Hotline is 1-800-273-8255.
