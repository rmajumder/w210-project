  "<p>Lawyers for Melania Trump are pursuing legal action against the Daily Mail for reporting \u201c100% false\u201d rumors that she worked as an escort in the 1990s as well as raising questions about her immigration status at the time.</p> <p>While Donald Trump has a reputation for threatening and pursuing litigation, it is unusual for a major party nominee or their spouse to mount legal action against a publication only months before an election.</p> <p>The Republican nominee\u2019s wife had <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MELANIATRUMP/status/761212858944421888?lang=en\">previously denied</a> a story in Politico<em> </em>in which questions about her immigration status were first reported but had not previously addressed the other accusations.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/04/melania-trump-nude-photos-work-visa-immigration\">Melania Trump denies working unlawfully as model in US on improper visa</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The suit comes in the wake of Trump launching an offensive against many media outlets, banning some such as Politico and the Washington Post from covering his rallies as well as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/26/trump-pledges-curb-press-freedom-libel-laws-first-amendment\">calling for stricter libel laws</a> in the US. He also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/25/donald-trump-media-ban-guardian-denied-entry-campaign-event\">banned the Guardian from attending an event in Scotland</a> after Trump took offence when reporter Ewen MacAskill questioned the Republican nominee about his allegedly \u201ctoxic\u201d politics. </p> <p>In a statement to the Guardian, Charles Harder, an attorney at the firm of Harder, Miller and Abrams which is representing Trump, said: \u201cThis law firm is litigation counsel for Melania Trump. Mrs Trump has placed several news organizations on notice of her legal claims against them, including Daily Mail among others, for making false and defamatory statements about her supposedly having been an \u2018escort\u2019 in the 1990s. All such statements are 100% false, highly damaging to her reputation, and personally hurtful. She understands that news media have certain leeway in a presidential campaign, but outright lying about her in this way exceeds all bounds of appropriate news reporting and human decency.\u201d</p> <p>Harder\u2019s not-quite-four-year-old Beverly Hills firm, Harder Mirell &amp; Abrams LLP, is perhaps best known for representing Hulk Hogan in the lawsuit that eventually <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/jun/10/gawker-media-bankruptcy-auction-hulk-hogan-lawsuit\">bankrupted Gawker Media</a>, which was sold at auction to media company Univision earlier in August. The suit was funded by Silicon Valley billionaire Peter Thiel, who spoke on behalf of Trump at the Republican national convention in Cleveland. Harder has also represented a number of other plaintiffs against Gawker as well; most recently, Harder has threatened a lawsuit against the now-defunct website because of <a href=\"http://gawker.com/now-peter-thiels-lawyer-wants-to-silence-reporting-on-t-1781918385\">an investigative report</a> about Donald Trump\u2019s hair.<br></p> <p>A spokesperson for the Daily Mail did not respond to a request for comment. </p> <p>Harder has since confirmed to the Guardian that Melania Trump is also considering filing lawsuits against other publications including Politico and the Week. Harder said that those publications are all \u201con notice\u201d and no suit has been filed yet. The Guardian has since learned that Politico has received a letter from Harder putting the publication on notice of a potential legal action. The lawyer\u2019s complaints <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/08/melania-trump-immigration-donald-226648\">related to a 4 August story </a>about Melania Trump\u2019s immigration status when she first came to the United States. For other publications, Harder did not specify which articles Melania Trump considered defamatory.</p> <p><em>Additional reporting by Sam Thielman</em></p>",

Additionally, critics of the policy worry that students will drink much more heavily before parties, meaning that once they show up, there will be greater risks that someone might take advantage of them.</p> <p>\u201cI actually think this is putting students in danger,\u201d said Michele Landis Dauber, a Stanford law professor and vocal <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/07/stanford-sexual-assault-victims-few-options-recourse\">critic of the university\u2019s sexual assault policies</a>. \u201cIt\u2019s going to drive it underground \u2026 and encourage this super quick consumption not in a public area.\u201d</p> <p>By targeting drinking at parties, it opens the door for juniors and seniors who are 21 and older to entice younger women to come to their dorms and drink there, she said.</p> <p>Turner, who was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/30/stanford-swimmer-convicted-of-sexually-assaulting-woman-after-fraternity-party\">convicted</a> of multiple felonies, assaulted a woman by a dumpster after a fraternity party and was caught when two bystanders saw him \u201cthrusting\u201d on top of the motionless woman and intervened.</p> <p>The case received international headlines after the victim released an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/06/stanford-sexual-assault-case-victim-impact-statement-in-full\">emotional statement</a> about the trauma of the assault and trial. She wrote about how painful it was to hear Turner and others suggest that the assault was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/07/stanford-sexual-assault-letters-brock-turner-judge\">her fault</a> and that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/19/stanford-sexual-assault-brock-turner-victim-personal-questions\">alcohol was to blame</a>. </p> <p>\u201cBrock Turner said he was a victim of Stanford\u2019s alcohol culture \u2026 and I believe Stanford was really stung and embarrassed,\u201d said Dauber, who is a family friend of Turner\u2019s victim and is leading a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/06/stanford-sexual-assault-judge-recall\">campaign to recall the judge</a> who gave him a light sentence.</p> <p>She said she feared the rule could also increases risks of alcohol poisoning.</p> <p>Critics say that instead of focusing on preventing excessive drinking, which is inevitable on college campuses, universities should be working to shift the culture around sexual assault, provide thorough education on consent and hold perpetrators accountable in meaningful ways.</p> <p>If the university was serious about changing alcohol rules in an effort to stop sexual assaults, then administrators should be re-evaluating how it regulates fraternity parties and social events for athletes, Dauber added.</p> <p>Stanford spokeswoman Lisa Lapin did not respond to questions about the criticisms and emailed the Guardian an earlier <a href=\"http://news.stanford.edu/2016/03/09/alcohol-student-policy-030916/\">statement</a> from president John Hennessy and provost John Etchemendy in which they noted that more than 1,800 college students die each year from alcohol-related incidents and that nearly 100,000 experience sexual violence tied to alcohol consumption.</p> <p>\u201cWe need new solutions \u2013 solutions that reduce risk for students, that reduce the pressure on students to drink, and that meaningfully change our culture around alcohol,\u201d they wrote.</p>",

  "<p>After years of delay, thousands of indigenous Canadians who were forcibly removed from their homes as children are finally getting their day in court.</p> <p>An Ontario superior court judge will on Tuesday hear arguments in a summary judgment motion for a class-action lawsuit brought against the Canadian federal government by survivors of the episode, known as the \u201cSixties Scoop\u201d.</p> <p>Around 16,000 indigenous children were taken from their families and communities, and put up for fostering or adoption by mostly non-indigenous families across Canada and the United States \u2013 often without the consent of their parents. Some were sent as far away as New Zealand and Australia.</p> <p>Survivors and their families say the forced removal robbed the children of their cultural identity and caused an emotional rift that has been felt through generations.<br></p> <p>The lawsuit was launched in February 2009 by two survivors, including Marcia Brown Martel, the class action\u2019s representative plaintiff, who was just four when she was removed from her family home on the remote Beaverhouse First Nation near Kirkland Lake, Ontario. She spent time in foster care before being adopted into non-indigenous family.<br></p> <p>Tuesday\u2019s hearing comes after seven years of delays that were mostly due to appeals by the federal government, which has fought the class-action since it was launched.<br></p> <p>It is estimated some 16,000 on-reserve children were removed from their homes by Ontario\u2019s child welfare services between 1965, when the federal government signed an agreement with the province to extend its welfare programs to reserves and 1984, when the provincial government incorporated protections regarding cultural identity into law.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/25/indigenous-australians-and-canadians-destroyed-by-same-colonialism\">'It's the same story': How Australia and Canada are twinning on bad outcomes for Indigenous people</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The episode has drawn comparisons to similar chapters in other countries: in Australia, thousands of Indigenous children were systematically removed from their families and communities between 1910 and 1970. In 2008, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/feb/11/australia\">then prime minister Kevin Rudd formally apologized</a> to the surviving members of the \u201cStolen Generations\u201d. In the US, the Indian Child Welfare Act was introduced in 1978 to counter the disproportionate removal of Native American children.<br></p> <p>The current class-action suit in Canada centres on whether Ottawa had the obligation to take steps to preserve and protect the cultural identity of the thousands of on-reserve children who were placed in non-aboriginal foster care or adoptive homes over that 20-year period. The federal government denies that claim.<br></p> <p>Jeffery Wilson, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, said that a ruling in the suite would be the first of its kind in the western world.<br></p> <p>\u201cNo First Nations case yet to this day has asked the question as to whether or not the loss of identity is an actionable wrong. Aboriginal title to property has been litigated, aboriginal title to identity has not,\u201d he told the Guardian.<br></p> <p>Last week, in an open letter to Justin Trudeau, five indigenous leaders called on the prime minister to commit to resolving the issue without further delay.<br></p> <p>\u201cFew things matter more than acknowledging and righting historic, and ongoing, wrongs affecting children,\u201d they wrote.<br></p> <p>\u201cThis moment is an opportunity for Canada to put an ugly legacy behind us, for the government to take steps to reform its conduct so that the injustice does not continue and build a better future for all.\u201d<br></p> <p>In the summary judgment proceedings on Tuesday, the plaintiffs will argue they have enough evidence to avoid going ahead with a full trial. <br></p> <p>The federal Liberals, who have made renewing the relationship with indigenous Canadians a priority, have signaled they are open to seeking a resolution outside the court system.<br></p> <p>In a statement on Monday, a spokeswoman for indigenous affairs minister Carolyn Bennett said: \u201cOur government believes that negotiation, rather than litigation, is the preferred route. We remain open to resuming negotiations to explore options for redress outside of court.\u201d<br></p> <p>The class-action is seeking C$85,000 ($65,601) per person in damages.

And it takes into consideration the thousands of people who start or finish work late to keep our global city running 24/7, too.</p> <p>Many actions from the OPEN Sydney strategy have now been incorporated into our routine work: we\u2019ve led Sydney\u2019s small bar revolution and introduced food trucks, upgraded taxi ranks and improved wayfinding, increased CCTV, developed (and are now implementing) a live music action plan, and funded late night ambassadors to help people find the places or services they need.</p> <p>But the big changes to our night-time economy depend on the NSW government: running public transport 24-hours; replacing lifetime liquor licenses with renewable liquor licences, as in New York and Vancouver, that encourage better behaviour from venues; and new measures to manage venue growth and concentration, including the introduction of new \u201csaturation zone\u201d rules, that consider the number and type of licensed premises in a given area, along with relevant crime data and transport options.</p> <p>Two and a half years ago, there was a real problem in Kings Cross and the government implemented a blanket response.

Every day the average person uses nine personal care products, according to a survey by the Environmental Working Group. With most personal product ingredient lists taking up an unpronounceable paragraph, it can be a daunting area for consumers to navigate. Especially when something like the Wen lawsuit provides a reminder that personal care products are barely regulated in the US.</p> <p>There currently is no independent testing of ingredients in beauty products. However, if a particular cosmetic product is causing serious health issues, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) will step in with a consumer warning, <a href=\"http://www.allure.com/story/wen-hair-loss-controversy\">as was</a> <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/stephaniemcneal/wen-hair-loss?utm_term=.abvJE7mPP#.jdekjap33\">the case</a> with Wen. The FDA issued a public warning last month, saying that the company failed to address safety concerns. Wen, however, has persisted in saying that its products are safe, despite the FDA\u2019s objections and the company\u2019s own decision to settle the class action suit.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/fda-issues-safety-alert-for-popular-hair-care-product-over-hair-loss-complaints/\">In a statement, the FDA said that it could do little else to compel the company:</a> \u201cWe do not have the legal authority to require a cosmetics firm to provide product safety information.\u201d</p> <p>The only <a href=\"http://www.fda.gov/RegulatoryInformation/Legislation/\">FDA regulation of the cosmetic industry dates back to a few rules adopted in 1938</a> that have remained largely unchanged, leaving the cosmetic industry effectively self regulating. That self regulation allows cosmetic companies to voluntarily report adverse effects from their products to the FDA.</p> <p>In Wen\u2019s case, 127 instances of adverse effects were reported to the FDA, <a href=\"http://www.fda.gov/Safety/MedWatch/SafetyInformation/SafetyAlertsforHumanMedicalProducts/ucm511890.htm\">a fraction of the around 21,000</a> complaints made to the company.</p> <p>While cosmetic ingredients have not changed dramatically in the past 50 years, various additives in personal care products have received scrutiny in recent years. When there is a lot of attention around a cosmetic ingredient, companies will sometimes look to replace it with an alternative to avoid controversy. That can create new issues, as replacement ingredients have often been studied less than what they\u2019re designed to supplant.<br></p> <p>In the case of Wen, its products were advertised specifically as not having sulfates or detergents, as there have been public objections to their safety.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.ewg.org/enviroblog/2015/12/wen-hair-care-products-linked-hair-loss\">FDA doesn\u2019t require full ingredients lists to be made public</a>, so it is still unclear what chemicals might have prompted consumers\u2019 hair loss, but it\u2019s possible that one of the substitutes was the issue. <br></p> <p>Another way the beauty industry has responded to a lot of the concerns around its ingredients is by marketing \u201cnatural\u201d cosmetic and hair care lines. But because the term \u201cnatural\u201d is not regulated, it doesn\u2019t mean anything.</p> <p>\u201cNatural is a marketing trick to get people to pay more,\u201d says Perry Romanowski, a cosmetic chemist and a co-founder of <a href=\"http://thebeautybrains.com/\">The Beauty Brains,</a> a blog about the ingredients in cosmetics. \u201cCosmetics are not natural: there is nothing natural about them.\u201d</p> <p>New legislation might help address the regulatory gap. Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein and Republican Senator Susan Collins have <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3010453-2015-4-20-Feinstein-Collins-as-Introduced-BILLS.html\">proposed legislation</a> that would give the FDA the power to issue recalls and conduct their own safety tests of ingredients found in cosmetics.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/sep/16/antibacterial-soap-with-triclosan-found-to-be-no-real-threat-to-germs\">Antibacterial soap with triclosan 'no better at killing germs' \u2013 study</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A number of major cosmetic companies, such as Est\u00e9e Lauder, have backed the bill, but it still faces opposition from the Independent Cosmetic Manufacturers and Distributors, the cosmetic trade group for small to mid-sized cosmetic companies.</p> <p>While lobbyists fight it out in Washington, Nneka Leiba, deputy director of research at the Environmental Working Group, has a few words of advice for consumers. It\u2019s best if you can use single-ingredient alternatives, says Leiba, but she allows that not everyone can use something like coconut oil for all their skincare needs. She says reducing the number of products used everyday or using products with fewer ingredients, like those without artificial fragrances, can be another strategy.</p> <p>If a person is worried about the ingredients in their makeup, says Romanowski, not using products is another way to alleviate that worry. After all, he points out, there is \u201cno health benefit in using cosmetics\u201d.</p>",

It has not yet launched a formal investigation, but could so if it finds evidence of wrongdoing.</p> <p>Listed companies in Britain are required to disclose deals with parties who are connected with the directors. Mike Ashley is the executive deputy chairman of Sport Direct and still owns 55% of the company. However, Sports Direct said in a statement that the company and its auditors Grant Thornton were \u201ccomfortable that there was no related party disclosure required in Sports Direct\u2019s historic accounts\u201d.</p> <p>The revelation of the arrangement with Ashley\u2019s brother is the latest tremor to hit Sports Direct. The company is facing a rebellion by shareholders at its annual meeting next month over the treatment of workers and its business practices, with many planning to vote against the reappointment of Keith Hellawell as chairman. Thousands of Sports Direct warehouse workers are set to receive back pay totalling about \u00a31m after <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/09/sports-direct-warehouse-work-conditions\">a Guardian investigation</a> revealed the company was effectively paying workers in its warehouse in Derbyshire below the minimum wage.</p> <p>Sports Direct says on its website that Barlin Delivery Limited may provide international delivery to online purchasers. Barlin was incorporated in February 2015 and is owned by John Ashley. Its registered address is a detached house in a cul-de-sac in the Lincolnshire seaside town of Cleethorpes. Barlin\u2019s <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.sportsdirect.com/customerservices/barlindeliveryfaqs/barlindeliverytermsandconditions\">terms and conditions</a> say it uses DHL to deliver goods.</p> <p>Online orders from overseas customers make up about 6% of Sports Direct\u2019s \u00a32.9bn annual revenue and Barlin makes about \u00a3300,000 a year from the arrangement, the company told the Financial Times, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1ea7d2b0-6631-11e6-a08a-c7ac04ef00aa\">which first reported Barlin\u2019s work for Sports Direct</a>. This profit is twice the annual salary paid to Dave Forsey, the chief executive of Sports Direct.</p> <p>John Ashley worked alongside his brother at Sports Direct as head of IT until he left in 2014. Mike Ashley founded Sports Direct in 1982.</p> <p>The Pensions and Lifetime Savings Association, which represents pension funds with \u00a31tn of assets and shareholdings, warned the arrangement was \u201cyet another unseemly detail at a company where there are already serious concerns about corporate governance and oversight\u201d.</p> <p>Luke Hildyard, head of stewardship and corporate governance at the PLSA, added: \u201cSports Direct is an example of a case where shareholder pressure is needed on a range of significant issues.\u201d</p> <p>Mike Fox, head of sustainable investments at Royal London, which owns 0.18% of Sports Direct, said: \u201cWe have long-standing concerns about the governance of the company and have lost confidence in the ability of the non-executive directors to govern the company and protect the interests of minority shareholders.\u201d</p> <p>Accounting experts said that the existing concerns about Sports Direct mean it may have been prudent to publish the arrangement with John Ashley.</p> <p>Sarah Wilson, chief executive of Manifest, the shareholder advisory group, said: \u201cInvestors don\u2019t like surprises and so look for transparency and business models that are easy to understand. </p> <p>\u201cThe spirit of the law is as important as the letter. Unlike other retailers, Sports Direct\u2019s culture appears to be about minimum compliance \u2013 something we can see elsewhere in the annual report in relation to, for example, its strategic review where it publishes a laundry list of risk factors but says very little about how its management systems engage with its responsibilities.\u201d</p> <p>The address where Barlin Delivery is registered in Cleethorpes is one of the upmarket homes in Hewitts Manor, a 16-house estate sheltered from a busy main road by a six-foot privet hedge.</p> <p>The large detached brick building, dubbed Richmond House, boasts a mock Tudor frontage and a Victorian-style street lantern outside the front door, as well as a neatly kept front garden.<br></p> <p>Neighbours said that a woman named \u201cMaggie\u201d lived there but that they did not think John Ashley was living at the property. Ashley\u2019s co-director at Barlin is listed as a Margaret Brown.</p> <p>Sports Direct said the tie-up with Barlin allowed it to \u201cderisk\u201d its overseas delivery services.</p> <p>The company said: \u201cSports Direct took professional advice at the time (and subsequently) as to the most efficient way to structure its operations so that it could satisfy the following objectives \u2013maximise its internet sales, deliver value to its customers, de-risk the distribution logistics.</p> <p>\u201cThe result of this exercise was to set up a company outside the group in order to deliver some of the services required in the successful running of an internet operation.

  "<p>Islamist extremism is a growing issue for Britain\u2019s \u2013 and for that matter the world\u2019s \u2013 prisons. To recognise that reality is a vital first step towards dealing with it. It is also, in&#xa0;spite of some continuing pockets of denial and some lack of confidence in confronting it, the (relatively) easy bit. It soon leads on to a much harder challenge. How do the prison authorities devise a strategy for countering Islamist extremism that is appropriate, proportionate and effective without being counter-productive? Britain has a long and often ignoble history of trying to answer such&#xa0;problems in colonial contexts, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/maze-prison\" title=\"\">above all in Ireland</a>. Not all of its answers have proved to be successful, to put it mildly.</p> <p>Partly this is because the issue of Islamist extremism is not as straightforward as may appear at first sight. For one thing, Islamist radicals have very different aims from Irish republicans. The IRA is not interested in recruiting criminals but in creating support. Islamists, by contrast, are very much in the business of proselytising and converting the vulnerable. Nor is there much reliable evidence of radicalisation, in part because it can be hard to define, and in part because of security issues. <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/547032/acheson-review-summary-aug-2016.pdf\" title=\"\">Ian Acheson\u2019s redacted report</a> on the subject, on the basis of which the justice secretary Elizabeth Truss <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/aug/22/liz-truss-prison-system-islamic-extremist-isolation-unit\" title=\"\">announced new policies</a> for England and Wales today, contains few figures to justify one course of action rather than another. Maybe the figures are alarming; maybe they are not. Their absence makes it hard to evaluate the policies that supposedly follow from them.</p> <p>What we can know is that the authorities <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/feb/12/government-considers-single-supermax-jail-islamist-terrorists\" title=\"\">want to keep ahead of the game</a>. There are some 130 Islamist terrorists behind bars in Britain, many with long years still to serve on sentences for very dangerous crimes. But Islamist extremism is not confined to Islamist terrorist prisoners. It can develop among some of those who are in prison for \u201cordinary\u201d crimes. About 12,500 of the upwards of 90,000 prisoners in Britain\u2019s jails <a href=\"http://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefing/Summary/CBP-7487\" title=\"\">identify as Muslims</a>. That doesn\u2019t mean all of&#xa0;them are equally targets for radicalisation, although some of them are, as indeed are some non-Muslims as well.</p> <p>One recent estimate has put the number at&#xa0;risk at about 1,000. If true, that is evidence of a problem that indeed requires attention. It&#xa0;is in no one\u2019s interest for prisons to become training grounds for radical extremism. Nor is it desirable that some institutions, or wings of prisons, should become exclusive to&#xa0;any particular faith group. On the contrary, what is needed are effective deradicalisation strategies, tailored to the individual prisoner, and ultimately the application of the same rehabilitative approach, which ought to be the ultimate purpose of all prison regimes.</p> <p>The classic dilemma in dealing with strongly identifying groups in prisons is whether to concentrate those who cause a risk in a few places or to disperse them across as many as possible. Concentration keeps the radicals away from their prey, but it can provide a platform for grievances and a control nightmare. The Maze and Guant\u00e1namo Bay were prisons of this kind and both were very effective recruiting sergeants for the prisoners\u2019 causes.</p> <p>Yet if the extremist radicals are dispersed, control is dissipated. The way they are dealt with can then be at the mercy of the individual prison management, whose quality is highly variable. The vulnerable are&#xa0;also less protected from those who might try to radicalise them and whose proximity is always an allure. The temptation in either case, which Ms Truss appeared to endorse today, is to combine bits of the two approaches. <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-37151089\" title=\"\">Specialist isolation units</a> are to be built in top security prisons. But the authorities will also keep those who cause the problems on the move, the so-called \u201cghost train\u201d approach. None of these courses of action is a guaranteed success. None of them is cheap. Each is further complicated by the need to apply the strategy to remand prisoners, young prisoners and women.</p> <p>Prisons will never provide the solution to the problem of Islamist extremism. That&#xa0;lies outside the prisons, not inside them. It will be the work of generations. But it is right to expect the prisons not to make the problem worse. It is essential to stem the growth of Islamist extremism both by hard and soft policy. Both are relevant. The allure of extremism will never be blocked by one at the expense of the other. It is right to want best practice \u2013 whether in terms of control, rehabilitation or penal alternatives \u2013 to be shared. Many other countries have more acute prison radicalisation problems than Britain does, serious though ours is.</p>",

With the summer pause drawing to an end, these flaws and omissions are coming to the fore \u2013 as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/21/ventotene-summit-france-italy-germany-eu-brexit-vote\" title=\"\">an informal summit on Monday between the leaders of Germany, France and Italy partly illustrated</a>.</p> <p>For his meeting with Angela Merkel and Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, meant to pave the way to&#xa0;next month\u2019s EU summit, the Italian prime minister Matteo Renzi chose the historical site of Ventotene, off the coast of Naples. There, the three EU leaders paid respects at the tomb of Altiero Spinelli, an Italian anti-fascist activist who, while in detention in 1941, started writing a manifesto for a federation of European states. Written on sheets of cigarette paper and hidden in a tin box, the manifesto was smuggled out of prison and circulated among the Italian resistance \u2013 it has been described as one of the founding documents for Europe\u2019s turn away from confrontation and towards unity.</p> <p>That symbolical gestures may be sought to allay worries that the EU has come one dangerous step closer to disintegration as a result of the Brexit vote is hardly surprising. Yet it is substance, not just images of diplomatic choreography, that governments now need to produce. Right after the vote, there were continental calls to give the EU \u201ca new impulse\u201d and to heed a \u201cwake-up call\u201d. One line of thought even claimed that, with the British on their way out, further integration would become an easier option. Not so. Brexit has brought more, not fewer problems to the EU \u2013 not least because the whole separation process drains collective energy. Continental Europe is as divided as it was before the referendum. France and Italy may nurture ideas about fiscal transfers and ambitious European investment plans to&#xa0;boost growth, but there is no more German willingness on display for that today than there was before the British vote.</p> <p>Whatever the topic, be it anti-terrorism, defence or migration, the EU-27 are well aware they need to demonstrate pragmatism, not lofty ideals, if they want to convince increasingly sceptical voters that the European project can deliver. With key elections due in France and Germany next year, and the growing pressure exerted by populist movements, calls for \u201cmore\u201d Europe are bound to run up against political obstacles that Brexit has done nothing to alleviate. \u201cBetter\u201d Europe sounds like a good slogan \u2013 but like other slogans, such as \u201ctake back control\u201d, no one is able to formulate what they mean exactly, nor how to translate them into hard facts. Britain may not have voted Brexit with a very clear idea of what it wanted it to mean. But the EU is also struggling to connect vision and reality.</p>",

To illustrate the point, let\u2019s look at who has chiefly profited from Scottish Labour\u2019s ongoing demise, with reference to the most recent Scottish parliamentary elections. It wasn\u2019t Rise, the new leftist party claiming to represent Old Labour values. It wasn\u2019t Solidarity, the socialist Trotskyist alternative. And it wasn\u2019t the old school Trade Unionist and Socialist Coalition. In theory, all of them should have gained from the burning desire of ordinary voters supposedly thirsting for a leftwing socialist alternative, but shock horror it was the centre-leaning Tories who came second to the SNP.</p> <p>Even taking into account the split between those favouring independence and those favouring the status quo, that\u2019s a funny way for disillusioned Labour voters to punish Scottish Labour under Dugdale for not being leftwing enough (though her manifesto was distinctly leftist). But I suspect this is perhaps too nuanced a reading for people who have already made up their minds and condemn anyone who doesn\u2019t agree with them 100% as a traitor. <br><strong>Colin Montgomery</strong><br><em>Edinburgh</em></p> <p>\u2022 As ballot papers are sent out to the 640,000 people entitled to vote in the Labour leadership contest, it is critical to debunk some outstanding myths that have grown over recent months.</p> <p>For instance, that Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s campaign will mobilise those who over recent years have ceased to vote for Labour and therefore will re-engage with the so called \u201ccore vote\u201d.</p> <p>Out of the hundred constituencies with the lowest turnout in the last two general elections, 92 are already held by Labour. The point being that, critical as mobilisation is, the issue of how to win a general election is much more complex than the question of engaging those who currently fail to vote at all.</p> <p>The second key issue is the notion that it is Jeremy Corbyn and Momentum who are creating new ideas and putting forward radical policies that do not exist in other parts of the Labour family.</p> <p>For instance, Zoe Williams (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/14/courageous-thinking-labour-education-jeremy-corbyn\" title=\"\">Opinion</a>, 15 August) takes to task those she dismisses as Blairites who failed to encapsulate a radical agenda of change.

If Bailey Rae\u2019s 2010 second album, The Sea revealed her as an artist of greater depth than her Radio 2-geared debut had suggested, The Heart Speaks In Whispers found her pushing even further outwards. Time and again, songs morph in unexpected directions; on In The Dark, delicate acoustic balladry explode into distortion before drawing back carefully, while Green Aphrodisiac (which graced the night-time half of Barack Obama\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/aug/11/barack-obama-summer-playlist-proud-affirmation-blackness\">summer mixtape this month</a>) winds up in a dreamy fugue state. Bailey Rae\u2019s natural sense of restraint, particularly vocally, makes for a compelling sense of tension when paired with the cosmic scope of her lyrics: skies break and waves part before Bailey Rae puts out a call to \u201cfellow astronauts\u201d, but all the while she sings as though whispering in your ear.</p> <h2>Tweet</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pN17ZnBX1c\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/8pN17ZnBX1c?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>It\u2019s been a good year for the quiet women of soul. Tweet wasn\u2019t always known as such, of course: her breakthrough hit, and still her best-known, was 2002\u2019s sultry and sparse Oops (Oh My), a Timbaland-produced, Missy Elliott-featuring ode to self-love released during a golden age of electronic experimentation in R&amp;B. Fourteen years later (and 11 since her last album, a longer wait than King and Ocean put together) Timbaland and Missy show up again, but this time it\u2019s for the gently swinging retro soul of Somebody Else Will. And even that\u2019s Tweet\u2019s only real nod to pop: pensive, diaristic emotional vignettes over fluttering, lovingly crafted live arrangements comprise the rest of the eponymous Charlene (eOne Music). Tweet\u2019s voice is as magnetic as ever, and her hooks are the sort to get under your skin without you realising.</p> <h2>K Michelle</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JbEG5SS1bI\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/-JbEG5SS1bI?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>No appreciation of R&amp;B is well-rounded if it doesn\u2019t take into account its louder, brasher characters as well as its quieter ones. K Michelle<strong> </strong>is rarely bestowed with hashtag honours like #BlackGirlMagic, but beneath the reality TV background and hot mess public persona is simply a formidable talent who\u2019s not ashamed to rip open her emotional wounds in her art. On her third album, the brilliantly titled More Issues Than Vogue, the verbal slaps she administers in rap, the gossip-baiting Idris Elba mention by name or the vibrator talk on Nightstand might be (highly enjoyable) aural clickbait - but cartoon fa\u00e7ades have a habit of disguising realness, and there are few singers as capable of communicating raw pain as K Michelle. Heartbreakers such as If It Ain\u2019t Love and Sleep Like A Baby, as well as nods towards K Michelle\u2019s country roots, demonstrate that relegating her to Twitter meme and punchline is doing her artistry an immense disservice.</p> <h2>Fantasia</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i623xz8D5HI\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/i623xz8D5HI?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Between K Michelle, Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s gun-toting Daddy Lessons and Miguel\u2019s collaboration with country star Kacey Musgraves on the strangely xx-like <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtS3SyevpvI\">Waves (Remix)</a>, mixing R&amp;B and country has officially been a trend in 2016. All of those examples were terrific, but the song that captured the emotional blood and guts at the core of both genres was Fantasia\u2019s Ugly. In just over three minutes, the first American Idol winner takes in body image, class division, an unhappy marriage and alcoholism. A pivot into gospel midway through is unexpected but hard-won, Fantasia bellowing out \u201cGive me good food that sticks to my bones\u201d in that unmistakeable rasp that feels possessed by every word she sings. Ugly is the only outright country moment on Fantasia\u2019s fifth album, The Definition Of\u2026 (19 Recordings) but the pleasant surprise is how varied her craft is becoming with each album; as well as the latter-day Tina Turner rock-soul style she\u2019s suited to, cuts such as Stay Up show what Fantasia can do with space and stateliness as well as busier tempos.</p> <h2>Jamila Woods</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asVhafDASjo\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/asVhafDASjo?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>What\u2019s been especially notable about the healthy state of R&amp;B in 2016 is the range of styles it encompasses, both sonic and lyrical: there\u2019s no such thing as an R&amp;B archetype any more.

Abra\u2019s Princess EP marked her out as one of the most distinctive singers and producers in any genre today. Richard, whose final instalment of her own trilogy is due this year, has been a whirlwind of imaginative boundary-pushing activity in advance of it, from collaborations with <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2016/06/dawn-richard-vr-music-video/\">Machinedrum to 3D virtual reality</a> videos. But it\u2019s crucial to remember the lack of institutional support that R&amp;B artists on major labels continue to have, and the limbo many still find themselves stuck in. <strong>Tinashe</strong>\u2019s follow-up to her acclaimed 2014 debut Aquarius was reportedly scrapped and restarted from scratch. <strong>Sevyn Streeter</strong> has been releasing impeccable singles for three years (the latest is the distorted party haze of Prolly) but Atlantic have yet to allow a full-length album to be released. And <strong>Kehlani</strong>\u2019s self-released 2015 debut You Should Be Here won her a deserved Grammy nomination, but despite the quality of singles such as 24/7, simultaneously heartbreaking and comforting in light of the singer\u2019s own suicide attempt in March, people treated her less as an artist to fight for, \u00e0 la Ocean, and more like a gossip blog punchline. It\u2019s curious that a hysterical fever pitch was reached in the service of harassing an artist to speed up a creative process he was free to indulge in for as long as he wanted, but not to actually support artists who might need it.</p>",

A half cup might provide 10% of an inmate\u2019s daily intake, but it\u2019s still only a half cup of soup or cereal. Even inmates who have consumed three prison meals want to supplement their daily intake with more food; it\u2019s the reason why so many inmates (particularly women) <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2015/10/11/444526183/biking-behind-bars-female-inmates-battle-weight-gain\">gain weight</a> rather than lose it.

The prison actually encourages inmates to consume what is bad for them.</p> <p>Even if ramen\u2019s danger remains debatable, though, other inmate poisoning scenarios are not. </p> <p>Just last year, inmates on Rikers Island reported that they believed the staff had poisoned their meatloaf; some of them saved the food as evidence and lawyers reported examining it and finding pieces of blue pellets. The food was later tested and confirmed to have been laced with <a href=\"http://kfor.com/2015/04/30/inmates-suing-after-prison-food-tested-positive-for-poison/\">rat poison</a>. The food tampering occurred when the usual inmate kitchen workers were not allowed near the food and staff stepped in to do inmate tasks.

  "<p>Android 7.0 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/mar/10/android-n-google-reveals-future-of-android\">Nougat</a> is the new version of Google\u2019s mobile operating system, used by billions of devices around the world. </p> <p>It features longer battery life, improved multitasking and smarter notifications in a slimmed down and refined Android experience \u2013 following on the work done in last year\u2019s <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/oct/22/google-android-6-0-marshmallow-review-longer-battery-life-now-on-tap-apps\">version 6 Marshmallow</a></p> <p>It is faster, more polished and a subtly-better experience all-round. Apps install more quickly, the OS can be smaller in size and updates to Android can be installed on the fly, without having to wait for 10 minutes while it reboots, if you have a new device. The new Vulcan API graphics system is also baked in for better gaming performance and Nougat will support Google\u2019s Daydream virtual reality system, eventually.</p> <p>Nougat is not, however, a major visual overhaul of Android. Those that have used Marshmallow on any of Google\u2019s Nexus smartphones or devices with little in the way of modification to Android, such as the OnePlus 3, will instantly recognise it.</p> <p><em>This review was conducted using a pre-release version of Nougat running on various Google Nexus and Pixel devices, as such some small things may vary on the production version of Nougat released today.</em></p> <h2>Improved notifications</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fe1edf4c2a4c4194704e66099ecca00e9da47dd6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fe1edf4c2a4c4194704e66099ecca00e9da47dd6/0_0_1440_1358/1000.jpg\" alt=\"android 7 nougat review\" width=\"1000\" height=\"943\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nougat makes quick replies default for almost all communication-based notifications.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Most of the work has gone on behind the scenes but the one obvious change in Nougat is to notifications. They\u2019re now flatter and wider, filling the entire width of the screen on a smartphone, and joined directly to each other, which wastes less space than Marshmallow\u2019s card-like appearance. Multiple notifications from the same app also cluster together, which cleans up the notification shade and makes it easier to see what\u2019s what at a glance and dismiss en masse.</p> <p>The biggest functional change for notifications, however, is the wider roll out of quick reply functions. Google\u2019s apps such as Messenger and Hangouts have had quick reply features for a while but now basically every communications app should have the feature.</p> <p>Users can hit reply from the notification and type their message directly into the box under the notification, which will also show a small snippet of the history of the conversation if you haven\u2019t opened the app since the last reply.</p> <h2>Quicker quick toggles</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0386d7993f0dff5e2b88f6c41e3cbb41f665f5d7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0386d7993f0dff5e2b88f6c41e3cbb41f665f5d7/0_0_2880_2560/1000.jpg\" alt=\"android 7 nougat review\" width=\"1000\" height=\"889\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The first stage of the notification shade pull down now includes a top row of quick toggles, which then pulled down again reveal the whole lot.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Above notifications Google has also put a row of icons for toggling features such as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, screen rotation and similar, which can be quickly tapped without expanding to the full set of quick toggles. It reduces the number of swipes needed to turn off Wi-Fi, for instance, by one and is a simple, helpful new addition.</p> <p>You can customise what appears there, by modifying what\u2019s in the top of the full quick toggles pane. Dragging down from the top with two fingers still opens up the full quick settings pane in one motion.</p> <h2>Multi-window</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5dd1f6d1539dc66fcf159ce2aa772a5c1dd1e743\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5dd1f6d1539dc66fcf159ce2aa772a5c1dd1e743/0_0_2560_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"android 7 nougat review\" width=\"1000\" height=\"703\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Multi-window makes Android tablets more useful for productivity and can be used either in landscape or portrait.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Multi-window, or side-by-side split screen support, is the other big new functional addition. There are three ways to activate it. Pressing and holding the so-called overview button with one app on screen invokes the recently used apps list in a split-screen view to select a second app to put on screen. You can also do it from the recently used apps list by taping and holding one of the apps in the list and dragging to the top of the screen or the left or right-hand sides if in landscape, allowing you to pick the other app from the list.</p> <p>A hidden method activated in the System UI Tuner works by swiping up on the screen from the overview button.</p> <p>Once in split-screen mode, Nougat behaves similarly to Windows and iOS. Users can drag the black bar in the middle to change the size of the split, or remove it altogether. Pressing and holding the overview button, which shows as two halves when active, will cancel multi-window too.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3886b478747806a1d60a3a48474af4df9f248967\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3886b478747806a1d60a3a48474af4df9f248967/0_0_2560_1440/1000.jpg\" alt=\"android 7 nougat review\" width=\"1000\" height=\"563\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Portrait multi-window mode on a smartphone isn\u2019t very useful, but landscape split-screen can be useful on larger devices.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It works really well, with almost every app supporting it. Only a very small minority of apps actively block it, and those might be updated in the near future to support multi-window.</p> <p>It\u2019s a feature that should have been there for a long time for Android tablets and makes them more productive as work machines. It\u2019s less useful for smartphones, although landscape multi-window on large-screen phablets can be useful in situations where you need to keep an eye on two things simultaneously, such as a map and a conversation.</p> <h2>Double tap overview to switch to most recent app</h2> <p>Double-tapping the overview button will also switch straight to the last-used app, which makes bouncing between two apps a lot faster. Copy text or links between apps is now rapid. Other devices, including the OnePlus 3 have had this feature for a while, but it\u2019s good to see it baked into Android.</p> <h2>Longer battery life thanks to Doze 2.0</h2> <p>One of the best bits about Android 6.0 Marshmallow was the introduction of Doze, a feature that helped save battery when the phone or tablet wasn\u2019t moving, such as being placed on a desk. It made a big difference to standby battery life.</p> <p>Android 7.0 Nougat applies the same battery-extending features to when the phone is moving too. When the screen is off, Nougat has much tighter controls on what can and can\u2019t access data, how frequently and how often it wakes the phone up. The result is between 15 and 20% longer battery life in my testing on a Nexus 6P.</p> <h2>Facial recognition improvements</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0bd21d766bbbf3ceb8173d76989d2fe242ca50cf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0bd21d766bbbf3ceb8173d76989d2fe242ca50cf/0_0_2560_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"android 7 nougat review\" width=\"1000\" height=\"703\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nougat improves Android\u2019s smartlock feature, making face matching significantly faster and more accurate.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Google\u2019s smart lock features have been around for a while. They use a combination of sensors to know when to deactivate the screen lock and when to make sure the passcode is always required.</p> <p>Facial recognition has been available for a while, but the trusted face system has significantly improved since Android 6.0 Marshmallow, which is particularly useful for tablets and other devices without a fingerprint scanner. Using a Pixel C, the system went from slightly useful in the odd occasion when it worked to unlocking the device about 80% of the time.</p> <p>In fact, the onlytimes it didn\u2019t recognise my face were when I was wearing sunglasses and overly large headphones.</p> <h2>Verdict</h2> <p>Overall Android 7.0 Nougat is a great update. It makes some significant changes under the hood that provide benefits including longer battery life. The visual tweaks are subtle and most will likely be masked by the customisations made to Android by third-party manufacturers.</p> <p>The quick-reply additions to notifications feel like they should have been there from the start. But perhaps the best small tweak that all manufacturers should now adopt is the ability to double-tap the overview button to quickly jump between the last two used apps. It\u2019s so much faster than bouncing to a menu and back, and takes no dexterity at all to activate.</p> <p>One thing is certain, however \u2013 if you didn\u2019t like Android Marshmallow, Nougat isn\u2019t going to do anything to change your mind.</p> <p><em>Google\u2019s Nexus devices, including the Nexus 6, 5X, 6P, 9 and Nexus Player, as well as the Google Pixel C tablet, will receive the update over-the-air starting today. The LG V20 will be the first new smartphone to launch with Nougat due for release soon.</em></p> <ul> <li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/oct/22/google-android-6-0-marshmallow-review-longer-battery-life-now-on-tap-apps\"><strong>Google Android 6.0 Marshmallow review: more polished, greater control and longer battery life</strong></a><br></li> </ul>",
  "<p>Deportivo Alav\u00e9s\u2019s resistance finally broke four minutes after midnight when the 27th shot of the match flew in, or so it seemed. K\u00e9vin Gameiro\u2019s foot trembled and he waited a long time \u2013 two minutes passed between Atl\u00e9tico Madrid winning one last chance and him taking the penalty \u2013 but he smashed the ball into the net. When it bounced out again, Manu Garc\u00eda furiously smashed it into the stands, where the <em>colchoneros</em> were going crazy. Up in the north corner of the Calder\u00f3n, occupied by 400 Alav\u00e9s supporters, the drums stopped for the first time.</p> <p>Just because the goal had been coming, the siege overwhelming, did not make it hurt less. It was 1-0, 92.06 and over. Their <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2006/may/15/europeanfootball.sport\" title=\"\">return to primera</a> a decade later had ended in defeat. But Alav\u00e9s have been through worse than this before, and so had Garc\u00eda. Resistance gave way to rebellion: if only for a moment, if only in anger. And it was enough. As they kicked off, time up now, the clock showing 93.21 when the board had shown 93, there was a look. Then there was a long ball that was not quite long enough, a header, a sliced clearance and another header, and then it happened.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/21/gareth-bale-real-madrid-sociedad-la-liga-match-report\">Gareth Bale\u2019s double gets Real Madrid off to a flyer against Real Sociedad</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThe things that go through your mind in barely a few seconds,\u201d Garc\u00eda said. \u201cIt dropped to me, I turned. I thought they\u2019d foul me. And I thought I was closer than I was; I thought it wasn\u2019t a bad place for a free-kick. But Correa didn\u2019t foul me. So I faked the shot, took another step. \u2018OK, pass it.\u2019 But, no. Impossible. So I hit it.\u201d</p> <p>Oh, he hit it all right, socks halfway down his shins. Alav\u00e9s\u2019s first shot on target, only their second in total: 94.02 on the clock. From 25 yards it rocketed in. \u201cI see it go in and the next five seconds are beautiful: you run and nothing hurts any more,\u201d Garc\u00eda said. It was late and it was hot but he sprinted to the corner and team-mates piled on. Silence fell, except high up at the other end. No one could believe it.</p> <p>There had been no goals on Sunday night and two on Monday morning, a new day. The ball had been back in play for 46 seconds but it was enough. Now there was time for only two more touches: a kick-off, a long hoof and that was it.</p> <p>They call Alav\u00e9s <em>El Glorioso</em> and somehow, no one really knows how, they had done it: 27-2 the shot count read; what did not hit the post or fly past it Fernando Pachecho saved, two of them in a row from two yards with two minutes left. Somehow they made it to the 93rd minute and, even more improbably, beyond.</p> <p>\u201cThe truth is, we didn\u2019t deserve to draw,\u201d said the Alav\u00e9s coach, Mauricio Pellegrino.</p> <p>\u201cWe were lucky that they didn\u2019t take their chances and then the penalty was avoidable, a mistake. Then there was that anger. We thought it was over but&#xa0;\u2026\u201d Garc\u00eda said. \u201cYou could say: \u2018How badly we have played, how many chances they had!\u2019 but it\u2019s Atl\u00e9tico, runners up in the European Cup.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2eb39d20b0cf52cda97db134baeb756ee4db60d2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2eb39d20b0cf52cda97db134baeb756ee4db60d2/0_23_4096_2457/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Manu Garc\u00ed\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Manu Garc\u00eda scored with Alav\u00e9s\u2019s first shot on target in the 95th minute of the match.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mariscal/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It is the first division, too. After 10 years away, three of them spent in the Segunda B, Spain\u2019s regionalised 80-team, four-division, theoretically amateur third tier; after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2006/feb/20/europeanfootball.sport\" title=\"\">suffering Dmitry Piterman</a>, collapsing into crisis and debt; after going into administration and coming out of it again, stable now but still small, still newcomers, still set to struggle; they were back. And like this. With luck, yes, and lots of it. But also with a ludicrously good goal, a ludicrously good moment, barely believable and better for it. Right, too.</p> <p>Somehow, sport finds a way. People do. \u201cIt\u2019s a game, it\u2019s a game,\u201d one Atl\u00e9tico player repeated last night, wide-eyed. It gets harder to break from the routine and upset increasing odds and, when it happens, it may be only fleeting \u2013 Alav\u00e9s know there will be trouble ahead \u2013 but there is still room for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/sep/01/numancia.barcelona\" title=\"\">moments like Mario\u2019s</a> and moments like Manu\u2019s. \u201cA fairytale\u201d, he calls it, and he\u2019s right.</p> <p>The man who spent the first eight years of his career in Segunda B and thought he would spend the rest of his days there too, who admits that his \u201cobjective\u201d \u2013 \u201cdistant\u201d and \u201cunlikely\u201d \u2013 was to play in the second division; a man who got around but never stayed further than 110km from where he was born, who was not given a chance in the first team at Real Sociedad, was dropped by Girona after a month, was left unregistered by Eibar and who \u201ccouldn\u2019t even imagine\u201d playing in the top flight, had just scored a last-minute belter at the Calder\u00f3n, his team\u2019s first primera goal in 10 years. And it is his team, too.</p> <p>The first time Manu\u2019s name appeared on the Alav\u00e9s shirt was in 2001 when they embossed it with the name of every <em>socio</em>. His was on the front, right in the middle, near the badge. Now it is on the back. He is proud of that historic pink shirt and laments the fact that he has not got the blue and yellow one <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2001/may/21/uefa.sport\" title=\"\">they wore in Dortmund</a>. \u201cA treasure,\u201d he calls it. Laments, too, the fact that he was not there that day against Liverpool, a season-ticket holder who was forced to watch the Uefa Cup final on television having joined Real Sociedad\u2019s youth system up the road in San Sebasti\u00e1n.</p> <p>Born in Vitoria, Garc\u00eda has, as he puts it, leapt the fence at the front of the general stand at Mendizorrotza, where his dad took him as a boy, and on to the pitch. \u201cWhile the other kids wanted to be Rom\u00e1rio or Laudrup, I wanted to be Manolo Serrano.\u201d Serrano scored against Madrid in the Copa del Rey in 1997 but never in the first division for Alav\u00e9s, even though he did take them there. Five years in a row Alav\u00e9s made the play-offs but did not make the second division. Serrano, there from 1995 to 1998, finally pulled them out of Segunda B and then scored the goal that took them up again, to the first division in 1997, at which point Espanyol, who had loaned him, brought him back.</p> <p>And if Serrano could not get there with Alav\u00e9s, how would Garc\u00eda? Crisis and a sporting director who knew him from Real Sociedad gave him the chance to play for his club. In his words: the club had dropped to his level. Together they would find another level and another and now another.</p> <p>Midway through a career spent entirely in the Segunda B \u2013 after winning promotion with Real Uni\u00f3n he was forced to return to Eibar rather than go up with them \u2013 the team Garc\u00eda supported signed him in 2012. Alav\u00e9s were in administration and, although things would slowly stabilise under new owners who came from success in basketball, it was a long way back. A big club with a big fan base, Alav\u00e9s were still down in Segunda B. Promotion came but, the year after, only a last-minute goal on the final day against Ja\u00e9n rescued them from heading back down. \u201cAgonising,\u201d Garc\u00eda calls it. He knows; he scored it.</p> <p>Just as he scored three in the last three games last season, having got only two all season before that, including the goal that clinched a return to the first division. He was the captain, the outstanding player, once an attacker \u2013 he had been top scorer in Real Sociedad\u2019s youth team \u2013 now a more defensive midfielder. Still, there were no guarantees that he would get there with them. Only nine of last year\u2019s team are still there and the coach has changed too; 16 new players have arrived. Only three men remain from Garc\u00eda\u2019s first season in 2012.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/20/barcelona-real-betis-la-liga-match-report\">Luis Su\u00e1rez scores hat-trick in Barcelona\u2019s 6-2 rout of Real Betis</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cI had always thought that Alav\u00e9s would make it to the first division one day because the project was good; what I didn\u2019t think was that I would be in the team,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd this summer, bloody hell, I was so happy when they offered me the chance to continue.\u201d</p> <p>He is happier now. \u201cJust to make your debut in the first division is difficult; I could never have imagined it. To make your debut for your team; well, very few can say that. And to do it against Atl\u00e9tico at the Calder\u00f3n. There will be a lot of suffering to come this season but one day, not yet, we\u2019ll look back on this and it will be a lovely memory, a tiny little bit of history, and maybe I\u2019ll remember the hard times too. There are lots of players who have made as much effort as me but not been as lucky as I was to be in the right place, for everything to fall for me.\u201d The ball, in particular \u2013 with the clock showing 94.07 in Alav\u00e9s\u2019s first game back for a decade.</p> <p>\u201cManu is a leader, he knows the history of this club very well and he worked so hard to get us here,\u201d Pellegrino said. \u201cNow he\u2019s a first division Manu; that\u2019s what I want from him. He deserves this.\u201d</p> <p>Outside the Calder\u00f3n the team bus was waiting. The fans, staying at first <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sidlowe/status/767485379700293632\" title=\"\">as the stadium emptied</a>, had pulled out by then; they had 350 kilometres ahead of them. A little after 1.15, the players did the same. There were no beers and no celebration, just a few games of cards and people trying to sleep. At five o\u2019clock Deportivo Alav\u00e9s rolled into Vitoria. They had come a long way.</p> <h2>Talking points</h2> <p>\u2022 That blond bloke looks pretty good. The one with the ginger beard. Leo Messi was superb as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/20/barcelona-real-betis-la-liga-match-report\" title=\"\">Barcelona hammered Real Betis 6-2 </a>at the Camp Nou. There was another match ball for Luis Su\u00e1rez and two goals for Messi. Which might not be much of a surprise. What is, but probably should not be, is that it looks as if Arda Turan might turn out nice after all. Luis Enrique called it almost perfect; Betis\u2019s two goals came from their only two shots and Barcelona might have got more. \u201cThey\u2019re frightening,\u201d AS\u2019s cover ran, \u201cbut Madrid aren\u2019t scared.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022Not scared of Real Sociedad, for sure. Without Ronaldo, Benzema, Modric, Pepe and Navas, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/21/gareth-bale-real-madrid-sociedad-la-liga-match-report\" title=\"\">they won easily at Anoeta</a>, impressive and in control throughout, slick, fast and dangerous. Gareth Bale did a Bale for the first, thumping in a header from Dani Carvajal\u2019s cross. That was with 74 seconds gone. He got his second with seven seconds left. Between them there was a gorgeous goal from Marco Asensio. \u201cMy head hurts when it comes to picking the team,\u201d Zinedine Zidane admitted afterwards. The debate was James or Isco. The answer was Asensio. Marca called him a \u201cmagician.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 Anoeta stood to applaud in the ninth minute, in honour of Dalian Atkinson.</p> <p>\u2022 Good Cop, bad Cop. Duje Cop committed more fouls than anyone else this weekend but he also got the opening goal on his debut for Sporting Gij\u00f3n \u2013 and it was a beauty too, volleyed in from a corner. That set Sporting up for a win against Athletic Bilbao that was surprisingly comfortable; certainly considering the way things had looked in the first half. Once they were given the chance to play on the break, Abelardo\u2019s team looked dangerous and genuinely good. The second was a lovely goal, superbly made by Burgui and neatly taken by Victor. \u201cWe ran like lions,\u201d Cop said. Tsk. Any five-year-old knows that cheetahs run faster than lions.</p> <p>\u2022 Sporting could face a fine after the referee stopped the game for a minute in the first half when he heard monkey chants aimed at Inaki Williams. The chants stopped, or seemed to, after an announcement was made over the PA system but that should not see them avoid punishment and, with new legislation, a reasonably serious one.</p> <p>\u2022 Two points down already. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter how you play, what matters is how effective you are. And when you don\u2019t win at the Calder\u00f3n you go home sad,\u201d Felipe Lu\u00eds said. He is right, of course, but when it comes to the analysis, there should not be much alarm. What is wrong with Atl\u00e9tico? Not much, really: 27 shots, 20 corners, two sitters, two posts \u2013 they did pretty much everything except score and there was a genuine variety to the way they attacked, even without Antoine Griezmann, although there may be some doubts about the type of strikers they have and whether they need either a touch more subtlety or maybe more size.</p> <p>\u2022 You come to a report to find out what happened \u2013 but the truth is, no one really knows what happened. But it was fun. It finished Sevilla 6-4 Espanyol and it could have been more, for both teams (and especially for Sevilla, who were stopped often by Roberto).

The unit sent officers to infiltrate student groups, mosques, religious bookstores, hookah bars and any predominantly Muslim areas to spy on people. It also worked on finding informants within the community, mirroring the actions of the CIA. </p> <p>The revelations triggered protests, prompted <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jan/07/new-york-police-settlement-muslim-surveillance-program\">a series of lawsuits</a>, and ruptured the relationship between the Muslim community and police. </p> <p>In the five years since, Almontaser said, things have improved, and the unit was disbanded by De Blasio.</p> <p>\u201cI think we have far better police and community relations than we did with [former] commissioner [Ray] Kelly and [former mayor Mike] Bloomberg,\u201d Almontaser said. </p> <p>Speaking to WNYC radio station, De Blasio said the community\u2019s call for more policing indicated that relationships had improved. </p> <p>But Fahd Ahmed, executive director of Desis Rising Up and Moving (Drum), said that the NYPD\u2019s surveillance program has continued \u2013 under a different name, with different methods. Drum conducted a survey between 2011 and 2015 across New York City\u2019s Muslim community and found that the surveillance was still happening.</p> <p>\u201cMore electronic surveillance, a lot more surveillance through social media over the last three years since this new administration has come in,\u201d he said. \u201cThose concerns around surveillance, around people\u2019s privacy, around people\u2019s civil rights, and around entrapment cases still remains from our perspective and our membership.\u201d </p> <p>The Muslim Leadership Council held an emergency meeting last week in the wake of the killings of Akonjee and Uddin.

Once we dried up the sales, because they can\u2019t make money, then there\u2019s no operation.\u201d</p> <p>The initiative inspired many others around the country, Karim said, and fostered a strong relationship with police, who partnered with the group after the plan was successful. </p> <p>But that relationship was damaged after the 9/11 attacks caused police to be suspicious of Muslims in the city. After the surveillance program was publicized in 2011, the mosque moved to remove all security cameras from the area. </p> <p>\u201cWe don\u2019t want people monitoring the masjid unwarranted,\u201d said Karim, who himself was singled out by the demographics unit. </p> <p>As head of security of the New York region in the Muslim Leadership Council, Karim will now offer security trainings to the boards of mosques on how best to safeguard the congregation without the help of police. </p> <p>Ultimately, Drum\u2019s Ahmed said the main way to ensure security is to build strong ties within and across the community in order to prevent things happening before they start. </p> <p>\u201cFrom our perspective, the most effective form of safety is strong communities,\u201d Ahmed said. \u201cThe strongest protection is if we strengthen our own communities, strengthen [the] relationship across our communities.\u201d</p>",

It was different a story however in Northern Ireland, where both loyalist and republican prisoners built up entire operational command and control networks in the Maze and Maghaberry jails.</p> <p>Those who back concentration argue that the new generation of convicted terrorist prisoners, of which 137 out of 147 are self-identified as Islamist, pose a different threat to the IRA. They claim that the proselytising activities of some extremists, including preachers such as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/16/anjem-choudary-convicted-of-supporting-islamic-state\">recently convicted Anjem Choudray</a>, will find fertile ground amid a growing Muslim youth gang culture in jails which have up to 20% Muslim population. David Cameron has claimed that there were as many as 1,000 current prisoners who are \u201cat risk of radicalisation\u201d.</p> <p>But as counter-extremism expert, Prof Peter Neumann, has pointed out: \u201cThe trade-off is this: you want to separate terrorist prisoners in order to prevent them from radicalising others, yet you don\u2019t want to create a focal point for public protests \u2013 a \u2018British Guantanamo\u2019, however much of a misrepresentation that might be \u2013 or provide an opportunity for terrorist prisoners to create (or recreate) operational command structures inside prison that might not have existed outside.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe second point is now more important than ever. With large numbers of \u2018lone operators\u2019 who may not be particularly ideological and who have failed to join the command and control structures of groups like Isis, the risk of them connecting with ideological and operational leaders while imprisoned is real. In other words, a policy of concentration may inadvertently help to create the kind of hierarchical organisation that the terrorists found it impossible to create outside.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/aug/22/liz-truss-prison-system-islamic-extremist-isolation-unit\">Extremist inmates to be moved between prisons in 'ghost train' plan</a> </p> </aside>  <p>These dangers were acknowledged on Monday by Chris Dean, the prison service\u2019s former head of extremism, who said there were no easy answers, and warned that while a network of special isolation units could be a practical solution to the problem of a small number of proselytising extremists, they could easily become a proxy for Muslim community protests.</p> <p>The problem for Truss is that the Acheson review, which was set up by Gove (who has form on the question of the risk of Islamist radicalisation), is thin on evidence on the scale of the problem inside prisons. Only a short 18-page summary of his classified report has been published, and as one prison service insider put it: \u201cI gather they found it very difficult to the evidence of radicalisation.\u201d For example the report admits there is no data on those converting to radical Islam behind bars.</p> <p>Truss has responded with a slightly fudged solution. No new single supermax prison but a series of isolation units across the six high-security jails.

A concerted effort at their deradicalisation has to be made and their release planned for.

  "<p>A federal court in Texas has blocked new US school rules for accommodating transgender students, setting up a legal battle with the White House that may soon head to the supreme court.<br></p> <p>As millions of American children prepared to return for the new academic year, <a href=\"http://www.txnd.uscourts.gov/judge/district-judge-reed-oconnor\">Reed O\u2019Connor</a>, a district judge in Forth Worth, issued <a href=\"https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/files/epress/Texas_et_al_v._U.S._et_al_-_Nationwide_PI_(08-21-16).pdf\">the nationwide injunction</a> late on Sunday night to prevent public schools from being forced to allow equal access to bathrooms and changing facilities. </p> <p>The case follows <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/us-departments-justice-and-education-release-joint-guidance-help-schools-ensure-civil-rights\">guidance issued in May</a> by the US justice and education departments which said transgender students were entitled to protection under sex discrimination laws and should be allowed access to \u201cactivities and sex-segregated facilities consistent with their gender identity\u201d.</p> <p>This rapidly escalating skirmish in American culture wars came after the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/09/lgbt-bathroom-bill-north-carolina-justice-department\">Department of Justice sued North Carolina</a> for a state law that forced people to only use public bathrooms that correspond to the gender listed on their birth certificates.</p> <p>But now Judge O\u2019Connor has upheld a complaint brought by Texas and a dozen other mostly Republican states who argue the Obama administration overstepped its constitutional authority by forcing schools to allow the opposite.</p> <p>\u201cThis case presents the difficult issue of balancing the protection of students\u2019 rights and that of personal privacy when using school bathrooms, locker rooms, showers, and other intimate facilities, while ensuring that no student is unnecessarily marginalized while attending school,\u201d wrote the judge in his 38-page ruling.</p> <p>\u201cThe resolution of this difficult policy issue is not, however, the subject of this order. Instead, the constitution assigns these policy choices to the appropriate elected and appointed officials, who must follow the proper legal procedure.\u201d</p> <p>Equality campaigners reacted angrily to the latest decision, which they said would put vulnerable students at risk.</p> <p>\u201cJudge O\u2019Connor\u2019s decision to bar the Department of Justice from enforcing this important guidance puts thousands of transgender students at even greater risk of marginalization, harassment, and discrimination as they return to school this fall,\u201d said Human Rights Campaign (HRC) legal director Sarah Warbelow. \u201cAll students, regardless of their gender identity, deserve to be able to learn in an environment free from discrimination.\u201d</p> <p>The nationwide ruling does not prevent schools or states from allowing access, something both sides claimed was a silver lining.</p> <p>\u201cAs the separate facilities provision is permissive, states that authorise schools to define sex to include gender identity for purposes of providing separate restroom, locker room, showers, and other intimate facilities will not be impacted by it,\u201d said Judge O\u2019Connor.</p> <p>\u201cDespite this judge\u2019s decision, schools are not barred from following the federal guidance, and school administrators still have a responsibility to ensure that the civil rights of all students are respected and that transgender students have access to facilities consistent with their gender identity,\u201d responded the HRC. \u201cAs lawsuits on the scope of Title IX proceed, we believe that justice will prevail as courts continue to recognise that discrimination against transgender students is a form of sex discrimination.\u201d</p> <p>Assuming it is challenged and then held up by the Texas-based appeals court, the latest ruling \u2013 from a judge who also fought gay rights advances \u2013 is likely to mark the opening salvo in what will swiftly become a major test of the supreme court\u2019s approach to civil rights for transgender individuals.</p> <p>\u201cWe are pleased that the court ruled against the Obama administration\u2019s latest illegal federal overreach,\u201d <a href=\"https://texasattorneygeneral.gov/news/releases/ruling-in-favor-of-school-and-state-rights-federal-court-stops-enforcement\">said Texas attorney general Ken Paxton</a>, who led the challenge by Alabama, Wisconsin, West Virginia, Tennessee, Arizona, Maine, Oklahoma, Louisiana, Utah, Georgia, Mississippi and Kentucky.</p> <p>\u201cThis president is attempting to rewrite the laws enacted by the elected representatives of the people, and is threatening to take away federal funding from schools to force them to conform,\u201d he added. \u201cThat cannot be allowed to continue, which is why we took action to protect states and school districts, who are charged under state law to establish a safe and disciplined environment conducive to student learning.\u201d</p> <p>The White House declined to join direct criticism of the judge\u2019s ruling. Press secretary Josh Earnest said: \u201cThe primary goal in offering this guidance was to ensure a safe educational environment for all students \u2026 It certainly was not a mandate. It was not described that way by the administration.</p> <p>\u201cIt was described that way by some of the administration\u2019s critics. I understand there are people eager to play politics with this just a few months before an election.\u201d</p> <p>Earnest added: \u201cOur goal has been from the beginning to provide for the safety, security and dignity of students all across the country \u2026 we certainly have confidence in the legality of the guidance.\u201d</p> <p>The White House also respected the rulings of federal judges, he said, and would allow the Department of Justice to determine the next step.</p> <p>The US supreme court, currently operating with a depleted bench of eight justices, recently temporarily blocked another similar rule in Virginia while it considers whether to take up the overall issue of transgender bathroom access in the coming term.</p>",

Each season has felt like a software update \u2013 refreshing the user interface and fixing the bugs, while keeping the basic framework intact. \u201cWhen we sat together and talked about what we wanted the show to look like, we were borrowing a lot from late 70s films like All the President\u2019s Men and <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2013/nov/19/the-parallax-view-kennedy-assassination\">Parallax View</a> and The Conversation,\u201d producer Jeff Freilich says. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"003e952c299d79c71be3c9c74654c44e42784c73\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/003e952c299d79c71be3c9c74654c44e42784c73/0_37_4500_2701/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Chris Cantwell and Chris Rogers\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chris Cantwell and Chris Rogers.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: James Minchin/AMC/AMC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWe conceived this show in a different age of television,\u201d Cantwell says.

The move to the San Francisco Bay area might seem like a curveball, but the way Rogers describes it, the choice was inevitable. \u201cSuccess for these people in that world became California, this idea. The last episode of the last season is called Heaven is a Place, because they were all acting like Silicon Valley was going to solve all their problems. </p> <p>\u201cI had a friend who worked on [the WGN series] Manhattan [who said]: \u2018We blew up the bomb. Now where do we go?\u2019 To have stayed in Texas would have been to blow up our bomb.\u201d</p> <p>There aren\u2019t any literal bombs on Halt and Catch Fire, nor do any seem to be heading our way in the future. This is a series that eschews the sorts of narrative pyrotechnics that one is used to seeing in the typical prestige drama. Cars don\u2019t explode and no one walks away from said explosion slowly while a classic rock song plays. Absolutely no one carries a sword. There are no zombies. It\u2019s AMC, so there\u2019s also no gratuitous nudity. Maybe that\u2019s why it\u2019s so hard to get the curious TV watcher to buy in to the show.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s hard to sit there and diagnose why people aren\u2019t watching it,\u201d Cantwell tells me in a conference room in the production office. There was surprise and joy from TV critics when <a href=\"http://www.avclub.com/article/amc-ignores-ratings-renews-halt-and-catch-fire-sea-226515\">the show was renewed for a third season</a>, as it had a paltry average viewership of 530,000 per episode. \u201cI have to live with the fact that you like what you like,\u201d adds Cantwell. \u201cIf people like the show, they love it. People that don\u2019t see the show, it\u2019s hard to get people to turn it on, because they go, \u2018What\u2019s it called?

The episode filming today is Donna-centric. Bish\u00e9 has to play both subtle comedy and intense internal struggle. Her greatest asset as an actor is her ability to describe the full gamut of emotions with a single glance. A pivotal scene filmed toward the end of the day features at least five different variations on Bish\u00e9 looking devastated, each one uniquely heartbreaking. Davis has the flashier role: impulsive, manic, brilliant, and (here\u2019s that word again) narcissistic. What she is not is a diva.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think describing her as a diva is very specific, actually,\u201d Bish\u00e9 says in the corner of the set that portrays her office, festooned with family photos, fake mail, and vintage San Francisco phone books from the period. \u201cWhat I said to Chris when I asked if we could change that word just now was: it feels very gendered to say diva. Narcissist feels less gendered and more specific to the scenario and to her actual personality traits.\u201d</p> <p>Rogers and Cantwell have made a habit of both being open to change and to supporting the foregrounding of their female protagonists. The emphasis on Donna and Cameron in season two turned around the mixed reaction to the first batch of episodes and set it apart from the dark anti-hero dramas of The Sopranos, Breaking Bad and Mad Men. </p> <p>\u201cI think the pilot we conceived was an anti-hero pilot about Joe MacMillan, and then we kinda changed it to a three-hander, and over time, the show has evolved into a kind of five-hander,\u201d Rogers says. \u201cI think that\u2019s just because TV has seen the anti-hero done. We thought there wasn\u2019t a lot more to say about the white male psyche, a guy that\u2019s difficult in business.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>TV has seen the anti-hero done. We thought there wasn\u2019t a lot more to say about the white male psyche</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Bish\u00e9 tells me: \u201cI was concerned that the character would be like any other wife and mom; frustrated, nagging wife that we see on TV a lot. There\u2019s this one scene where I come home, he\u2019s drinking a beer and I gotta get the kids ready, gotta make dinner, and in the midst of this, they broke their toy. I gotta look at this Speak-n-Spell and take it apart. And this is the first moment that we get this inkling that she\u2019s not all that we think she is. I remember the director [Juan Campanella] said, \u2018It\u2019s OK if you fumble a little bit. You\u2019re harried. You\u2019re in a rush.\u2019 And I was like, no, no. I need to be preternaturally good at this.\u201d</p> <p>This feels like a make-or-break season for Halt and Catch Fire. AMC has supported the show and allowed it to be exactly what its creators want it to be. The end of this run of episodes, which includes a bold plot twist, could function as a series finale, says Rogers, who believes audiences \u201cdeserve a degree of closure\u201d. Whether closure will be necessary remains to be seen. Months after my visit, AMC released the first episode of season three two days early without any advanced warning. It got people talking about the show, even if the intended audience might not have been aware that the episode aired. Unconventional marketing strategies could be the best way to bring eyeballs to this underdog series.</p> <p>\u201c[Halt and Catch Fire] is about creative people collaborating to try and bring a brilliant product to market, and the compromises you have to make along the way,\u201d Bish\u00e9 says. \u201cIf that\u2019s not analogous to a TV show, then I don\u2019t know what is.\u201d</p> <ul> <li>Halt and Catch Fire seasons three starts on AMC on Tuesday 23 August 9pm ET</li> </ul> <ul> <li>This article was amended to correct the spelling of director Reed Morano.

And we can protect human rights ourselves in a way that doesn\u2019t jeopardise national security or bind the hands of parliament.</p> <p>\u201cA true British bill of rights, decided by parliament and amended by parliament, would protect not only the rights set out in the convention, but could include traditional British rights not protected by the ECHR such as the right to trial by jury.\u201d</p> <p>Plans for a British bill of rights were put back until after the May 2015 election and David Cameron promised work would start in his first 100 days after his re-election. </p> <p>In February 2016, the then-justice secretary, Michael Gove, gave evidence to the House of Lords EU justice committee and said the process had become too intertwined in the question mark over Brexit. </p> <p>The Times reported that Truss had been asked to revisit work done by Gove on the legislation, <a href=\"http://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/shake-up-of-human-rights-laws-is-dead-in-the-water-pzlxx7thm\">amid rumours in Whitehall</a> that the proposal could be scrapped entirely. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/shake-up-of-human-rights-laws-is-dead-in-the-water-pzlxx7thm\">One source told the Times:</a> \u201cThe bill is ready but my hunch is that [May] might junk it.

I just don\u2019t think the will is there to drive it through.\u201d</p> <p>At the launch of her campaign for the Conservative leadership, May also said she did not plan to take Britain out of the European convention on human rights after the UK leaves the European Union. </p> <p>Prior to the EU referendum, May had said the ECHR was the issue, rather than the EU. However, asked if she would pursue a withdrawal at her leadership speech post-referendum, she said: \u201cI\u2019ve set my position on the ECHR out very clearly but I also recognise that this is an issue that divides people, and the reality is there will be no parliamentary majority for pulling out of the ECHR, so that is something I\u2019m not going to pursue.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>\u2018Economic and financial mismanagement, along with predatory policies, are in danger of making us believe that we can neither afford to feed the hungry nor care for the old.\u201d These words, as true now as when they were written in 1985, are from the paper Economic Policy As If People Mattered, by the distinguished public health researcher Peter Draper, who has died aged 83.</p> <p>That we now routinely consider causes of ill health \u2013 and of wellbeing \u2013 to be as diverse as work and unemployment, macroeconomic policy, fuel poverty and the arms trade owes much to Peter\u2019s contribution. He was instrumental in creating the study of health policy in the UK and was the country\u2019s outstanding public health practitioner in the second half of the 20th century.</p> <p>Early 1970s public health had a settled, environmental focus with no awareness of what we now call the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_determinants_of_health\" title=\"\">social determinants of health</a>. The 1974 reorganisation of the NHS removed local authority advocacy from public health, replacing it with technocratic NHS \u201ccommunity medicine\u201d. In this stifling climate, Peter\u2019s launch of the Unit for the Study of Health Policy (USHP) at Guy\u2019s hospital medical school, London, in 1975 was a breath of fresh air. He brought together practitioners of epidemiology, sociology, health economics, statistics and public health to challenge the predominant approaches that emphasised individualistic \u201cvictim-blaming\u201d. The USHP\u2019s groundbreaking reports redirected policymakers and practitioners towards the root causes of public health problems.</p> <p>For example, the 1980 report Accident and Illness Prevention analysed how the pursuit of market-oriented economic policies \u2013 what Peter called \u201cthe theology of economic growth\u201d \u2013 leads to unhealthy outcomes in which, for instance, traffic accidents are viewed not as social costs, but as an economic benefit because of the motor repair work and new car sales that they generate.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"ab77e40650b176aec45895f3c44e72846ebdd5b9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ab77e40650b176aec45895f3c44e72846ebdd5b9/0_0_622_1216/512.jpg\" alt=\"Health Through Public Policy, 1991, edited by Peter Draper\" width=\"512\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Health Through Public Policy, 1991, edited by Peter Draper</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Similarly, the 1977 USHP report Health, the Mass Media and the NHS, and the 1980 BMJ paper Three Types of Health Education, showed how public policy promotes the marketing of unhealthy products. The BMJ paper described the government\u2019s reliance on tobacco revenue at a time of recession and the media\u2019s dependence on tobacco advertising. Evidence from both Labour and Conservative health ministers (David Owen and Sir George Young) showed that these issues, and concerns for industry workers\u2019 and tobacconists\u2019 jobs, prevented effective control and weakened action to prevent smoking.</p> <p>The 1980 USHP report Rethinking Community Medicine \u2013 Towards a Renaissance in Public Health was a call for his profession to rediscover its role in the prevention of disease and the promotion of health.</p> <p>After funding problems shut down the USHP in 1984, Peter remained a prolific writer, consultant and activist.

In 1986 a <a href=\"https://www.hsj.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Health Service Journal</a> article, Whatever Happened to Public Health? which Peter and I wrote, led to the founding of the Public Health Alliance pressure group, later the <a href=\"http://www.ukpha.org.uk/\" title=\"\">UK Public Health Association</a>.</p> <p>He continued working on public health issues and in defence of the NHS, through the NHS Consultants Association (now <a href=\"http://www.doctorsforthenhs.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Doctors for the NHS</a>). In 1991 he edited <a href=\"http://www.publichealthjrnl.com/article/S0033-3506(05)80191-X/abstract\" title=\"\">Health Through Public Policy</a>: the Greening of Public Health, which brought together his thinking about the broad scope of healthy public policy \u2013 a now-familiar term that Peter had imported from the US a decade earlier.</p> <p>Born in Blackburn, Lancashire, to Alan, a textile engineer and mill manager, and Mary (nee King), Peter studied at Bolton school and Wrekin college, where he was head boy. His national service was as a Royal Air Force pilot in Canada and the UK. He studied medicine at Magdalene College, Cambridge, and trained in Manchester hospitals.</p> <p>Experience as a junior doctor influenced his future career in two ways. Horrified by the anger of a senior physician whose NHS waiting list Peter had cleared while covering his leave, thus preventing, as he saw it, the doctor from prioritising his private patients, Peter developed a dislike for private practice. He became aware of the importance of public health as he realised how much disease could be prevented through earlier intervention, or by different social and economic circumstances.</p> <p>Always reaching beyond the NHS and medical boundaries, Peter was president of the British Humanist Association (BHA), vice-president of the Ecology (now Green) party and president of the Health Visitors\u2019 Association. The BHA website states: \u201cThroughout its existence, the guiding conviction of the BHA has been that \u2018this is our world, our responsibility, our possibility\u2019, in the words of an early BHA member, Dr Peter Draper.\u201d</p> <p>He also gave strong support to community health councils as the campaigning voice of patients. Peter drew on his personal experience of being bipolar to campaign for recognition of the importance of working with the <a href=\"http://www.bmj.com/campaign/patient-partnership\" title=\"\">patient</a> in managing this condition.</p> <p>He is survived by his second wife, Carol Herrity, whom he married in 1999, and her children, Emma and Kayte; by two children, Nick and Jane, from his first marriage, to Dorothy Hopley which ended in divorce; and by five grandchildren and three stepgrandchildren.</p> <p>\u2022 Peter Alan Draper, public health researcher, born 3 July 1933; died 30 July 2016</p>",

What style of bathing suit should I wear to impress the chic French?</strong></p> <p><em>Amanda, by email</em></p> <p>Ooh la la, la plage fran\u00e7aise \u2013 c\u2019est si chic, n\u2019est-ce pas? What on earth to wear to a setting celebrated by everyone from Manet to Colette to Karl Lagerfeld? This year, there is only one answer: a burkini.</p> <p>As you\u2019ve all probably heard by now, the burkini \u2013 or full body swimsuit favoured by some Muslim women (and Nigella Lawson) \u2013 is the<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/16/burkini-ban-defended-as-french-mayors-urged-to-cool-local-tensions\"> latest item in France\u2019s eyeline of things they should ban Muslim women from wearing</a> in order to liberate them from patriarchal rules about female appearance, or something. I don\u2019t know, I\u2019ve tried to read about a thousand articles on this subject and yet somehow I can never get beyond the first paragraph because my brain keeps exploding.</p> <p>Following on from the<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/22/frances-headscarf-war-attack-on-freedom\"> ban on headscarves in schools and the outlawing of the niqab in public spaces</a>, it\u2019s now the turn of the burkini to be deemed incompatible with the French way of life. Trust the French to make exposure of female flesh an essential part of their national identity. So far five towns have banned the burkini and three more are in the process of doing so, all to save what Marine Le Pen calls in a totally non-dog whistle way \u201cthe soul of France\u201d. The prime minister, Manuel Valls, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/17/french-pm-supports-local-bans-burkinis\">added last week</a> \u201cthe nation must defend itself\u201d.</p> <p>Unfortunately, no one can quite decide what this soul is, or why it needs defending from a Muslim woman\u2019s bathing suit. The socialist government\u2019s minister for women\u2019s rights, Laurence Rossignol, has insisted this is a feminist issue: \u201c[The burkini] has the same logic as the burqa: hide women\u2019s bodies in order to control them,\u201d she said, apparently unaware that forcing them into bikinis could very easily be seen as another form of control. \u201cIt is not just the business of those women who wear it, because it is the symbol of a political project that is hostile to diversity and women\u2019s emancipation,\u201d she added. It really is something to hear a government minister allegedly in charge of women\u2019s rights quite happily trample on individuals\u2019 rights to wear their bathing suits \u2013 which do not contravene any form of French law \u2013 in order to make some kind of generalised theoretical point that goes against diversity, in the name of diversity. Is your brain exploding now? Because mine definitely just went again.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Do French politicians imagine these women will now come to the beach in the accepted French attire, ie, topless?</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Look, there are plenty of things about Islam\u2019s attitude towards women I don\u2019t like. There are plenty of things I don\u2019t like about my own religion\u2019s attitude to women, for that matter, but let\u2019s keep things focused here. Let\u2019s not kid ourselves that that\u2019s what this burkini hoo-hah is about. France has suffered more dreadful terrorism in the name of Islam than any other European country in the past few years and, at a loss of what to do about it, it is doing precisely what Rossignol criticises Islam for: it is singling out blameless women and making them feel bad about their bodies. This is what happens when French politicians exploit the country\u2019s celebrated <em tabindex=\"-1\">la\u00efcit\u00e9</em> (secularist principle) for political gain by playing to the lowest common denominator. Moreover, when the women\u2019s rights minister finds herself on the same side as le Front National, well, at least one of them needs to take a cold, hard look at themselves. After all, if Rossignol was so concerned about clothing that is \u201chostile to women\u2019s emancipation\u201d, perhaps she might consider banning white wedding dresses, which send out the message a woman needs to be a virginal, innocent cupcake when she marries. Or high heels, which say women have to pretend to be gazelles who love walking on their tip toes for purposes of sexiness. But are either of these being banned? No they are not. But then they are not associated with the Muslim religion. This is not about cultural relativism, it is about looking at \u201c<a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/dec/08/i-dont-care-donald-trump-brushes-off-horrified-reaction-to-his-muslim-ban\">what the hell is going on</a>\u201d.</p> <p>Honestly, what do these French politicians think is going to happen to these women, now banned from wearing their burkinis? Do they imagine that they\u2019ll now come to the beach in the accepted French attire, ie, topless with their modesty only covered with a tiny pair of bikini bottoms and an occasional cigarette? No, they\u2019ll stay home, banished inside and out of sight, unable to be on the beach with their children. Great soul defending there, France!</p> <p>France, you know I love you. Half of my family is from you and my parents live in you. But really, have you learned nothing from history? Did the events from under a century ago really not teach you that chip chip chipping away at the rights of a persecuted religious minority in your country purely to make their lives worse so as to appease a scared and angry populace does not do your \u201csoul\u201d any good? Right now, you sound like the vaguely racist team leader of a nudist camp, telling Muslim women they have to be at least semi-naked in order to prove their worthiness. I don\u2019t want to sound too off the ball here, but if you\u2019re so worried about how persecuted these Muslim women must feel in their bathing suits, perhaps talk to them first about it before you start swooping in like some colonialist savior, insisting you know what\u2019s best for them. Come on, France. You\u2019re better than this. And for the rest of us, let\u2019s break out the burkinis.</p>",

  "<p>If you walk along Britain\u2019s poorest streets, the phrase \u201cleft behind\u201d \u2013 in vogue again after many such places voted to leave the EU \u2013 takes on a complex meaning. It\u2019s not just that they are lagging behind the richer, better-connected places. It can seem, as you survey the pound stores and shuttered pubs, that these towns have been discarded: left behind, as in \u201cunwanted on the journey\u201d. Wealth has flowed out of them to somewhere else.</p> <p>The logical question should be: who did this? Sometimes it\u2019s obvious: in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jun/25/view-wales-town-showered-eu-cash-votes-leave-ebbw-vale\">Ebbw Vale</a>, for example, the answer is the Anglo-Dutch steel company Corus, which closed the plant in 2002. In many places it\u2019s not obvious. Jobs seep away; council services are privatised; bus timetables dwindle; the local school gets taken over by a \u201csuperhead\u201d from somewhere else, outsourcing the dinner ladies on day one. You can get angry about it, but there is nobody specific to be angry at.</p> <p>Faced with the same problem, union and community organisers in the US have, in the past 12 months, adopted a novel way of fighting back. Through a campaign group called <a href=\"http://hedgeclippers.org/hedgepapers-no-19-hedge-funds-attack-baltimore/\">Hedge Clippers,</a> they have begun tracing the lineages of financial power behind the decisions that affect specific places, and targeting those financiers \u2013 pension funds \u2013 with a new kind of pressure.</p> <p>Steve Lerner, one of the instigators of the 1980s <a href=\"https://talkpoverty.org/2015/06/16/justice-for-janitors/\">Justice for Janitors</a> campaign, which, for the first time, organised migrant cleaning workers in the US, explains how the tactic evolved. \u201cWe were organising janitors working for contract cleaning companies: but they\u2019re just middlemen,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we targeted the building owners. It turned out they, too, were dependent on banks and pension companies, so we got a trillion dollars worth of pension money to say it won\u2019t invest unless there is decent pay. Then we asked ourselves: OK, what else do they own?\u201d</p> <p>It turns out, quite a lot. In Baltimore, the city\u2019s privatised water industry hiked its bills. Then, when people started to fall behind in payments, the city agreed to bundle up their unpaid bills into a financial vehicle called a \u201ctax lien\u201d and sell it to investors. The investors can, after two years, evict people from their homes for non-payment.</p> <p>When campaigners looked at who was buying up the debt, they included an anonymous company linked to one of the biggest hedge funds in <a href=\"http://www.fortress.com/OurBusinesses/AlternativeAssetManagement/PrivateEquity/Default.aspx\">America: Fortress Investments</a>, with $23bn worth of assets invested in \u201cthe largest pension funds, university endowments and foundations\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jun/27/wales-referendum-remain-leave-vote-uk-eu-membership\">Why did Wales shoot itself in the foot in this referendum? | Richard Wyn Jones</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Since the 2008 crisis, with returns on government bonds negative, and stock market dividends depressed, pension funds have been pouring money into the hedge fund sector. \u201cIt\u2019s a form of assisted suicide,\u201d Lerner argues: \u201cWorkers are investing their pension money into firms whose mission is to destroy us.\u201d</p> <p>He set up Hedge Clippers, which aims to force pension funds to divest from companies whose investment strategies fuel the cycle of impoverishment.</p> <p>If you apply the same approach to Britain, you\u2019re dealing with a different ecosystem. No city has yet securitised the unpaid debts of the poor, as Baltimore did. While there is no shortage of predatory lenders to the poor, there are \u2013 after a campaign led by Labour MP Stella Creasy \u2013 at least elementary controls on them.</p> <p>However, pension funds are now the biggest source of money for UK hedge funds, according to a Financial Conduct Authority survey last year, with 43% of their money coming from institutional investors. The most obvious act of financial predation is the private finance initiative (PFI), where schools and hospitals were built with vastly lucrative private loans. As a result, the taxpayer is committed to <a href=\"https://scmdirect.com/sites/default/files/Hedge%20Fund%20Research%20Report%20-%20SCM%20Direct,%2017%20May%202016.pdf\">paying back \u00a3232bn on assets worth \u00a357bn</a>.</p> <p>Many pension funds, either directly or indirectly, are investing in the so-called \u201cinfrastructure funds\u201d who buy up PFI debt. The investment analyst <a href=\"https://www.preqin.com/docs/reports/Preqin-Infrastructure-PPP-PFI-July-2016.pdf\">Preqin</a> found 588 institutional investors worldwide with \u201ca preference for funds targeting PFI\u201d, 40% of which were based in Europe.</p> <p>Tracing the more complex ways institutional finance is funding the cycle of impoverishment is not easy. What you would want to know, in places such as Stoke-on-Trent or Newport, is not just who took the decisions to close high-value workplaces but, more importantly, who makes the decisions that lead to chronic under-investment now. Governments, including the devolved ones of the UK, spend a lot of time and money effectively bribing global companies to create jobs and keep them in Britain\u2019s depressed areas. Communities themselves have little or no input into the process, which is in any case all carrot and no stick.</p> <p>Lerner\u2019s initiative in the US grew out of trade union activism, because the unions there learned to follow the money instead of wasting time trying to negotiate with the powerless underlings of global finance. They worked out that, in an age where the workplace and the community can seem like two different spheres of activism, it is the finance system that links the two.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/25/left-behind-eu-referendum-vote-ukip-revolt-brexit\">Older \u2018left-behind\u2019 voters turned against a political class with values opposed to theirs</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Union organising of the unorganised, and community activism in Britain have both traditionally been weak because top-down Labourism has been strong.

  "<p>As <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/aug/22/google-x-self-driving-cars?utm_term=Autofeed&amp;CMP=twt_a-technology_b-gdntech#link_time=1471852234\">self-driving cars move from fiction to reality</a>, a philosophical problem has become the focus of fierce debate among technologists across the world. But to the people actually making self driving cars, it\u2019s kind of boring.</p> <p>The \u201ctrolley problem\u201d is the name for a philosophical thought experiment created as an introduction to the moral distinction between action and inaction. The classic example is a runaway mine cart, hurtling down tracks towards a group of five oblivious people. With no time to warn them, your only option is to pull a switch and divert the cart on to a different track, which only has one person standing on it. You will save five lives, but at the cost of actively killing one person. What do you do?</p> <p>All kinds of tweaks and changes can be made to the basic problem, to examine different aspects of moral feeling. What if, rather than pulling a switch, you stop the mine cart by pushing one particularly large person in its way? What if the five people are all over the age of 80 and the one person is under 20? What if the five people are in fact five hundred kittens?</p> <p>What if rather than a mine cart, you were in a runaway self-driving car? What if, rather than making the decision in the heat of the moment, you were a programmer who had to put your choices into code? And what if, rather than picking between the lives of five people and one person on different roads, you had to pick between the life of the car\u2019s sole occupant, and the lives of five pedestrians?</p> <p>It seems like a question that cuts to the heart of fears over self-driving cars: putting questions of life and death in the hands of coders in California who make opaque decisions that may not be socially optimal. After all, would you buy a car if you knew it was programmed to swerve into a tree to protect someone who crossed the road without looking?</p> <p>A recent paper in the journal Science <a href=\"http://science.sciencemag.org/content/352/6293/1573\">suggested that even regulation</a> may not help: polling showed that regulation mandating such self-sacrifice wouldn\u2019t be supported by a majority of people, and that they\u2019d avoid buying self-driving cars as a result. That, of course, would result in far more deaths in the long run, as the endless deaths at the hands of incapable human drivers would continue.</p> <p>But to engineers at X, the Google sibling which is leading the charge to develop fully self-driving cars, the questions aren\u2019t as interesting as they sound. \u201cWe <em>love</em> talking about the trolley problem\u201d, joked Andrew Chatham, a principal engineer on the project.</p> <p>\u201cThe main thing to keep in mind is that we have yet to encounter one of these problems,\u201d he said. \u201cIn all of our journeys, we have never been in a situation where you have to pick between the baby stroller or the grandmother. Even if we did see a scenario like that, usually that would mean you made a mistake a couple of seconds earlier. And so as a moral software engineer coming into work in the office, if I want to save lives, my goal is to prevent us from getting in that situation, because that implies that we screwed up.</p> <p>\u201cIt takes some of the intellectual intrigue out of the problem, but the answer is almost always \u2018slam on the brakes\u2019,\u201d he added. \u201cYou\u2019re much more confident about things directly in front of you, just because of how the system works, but also your control is much more precise by slamming on the brakes than trying to swerve into anything. So it would need to be a pretty extreme situation before that becomes anything other than the correct answer.\u201d</p> <p>Even if a self-driving car did come up against a never-before-seen situation where it did have to pick between two accidental death scenarios, and even if the brakes failed, and even if it could think fast enough for the moral option to be a factor (Nathaniel Fairfield, another engineer on the project, jokes that the real question is \u201cwhat would you \u2026oh, it\u2019s too late\u201d), there remains no real agreement over what it should do even in idealised circumstances. A public tool <a href=\"http://moralmachine.mit.edu/\">released alongside the Science paper</a> allows individuals to create their own ethical dilemmas, and the only consistent finding is that people are inconsistent \u2013 even when it comes to their own views. So it\u2019s probably for the best that we aren\u2019t trying to code those views into our cars just yet.</p>",

  "<p>Since its debut 16 years ago, Deus Ex\u2019s primary weapon has been choice: where to go, how to get there, who to speak to and how to speak to them are all up to you in a series where almost every scenario has multiple outcomes. After releasing 2011\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/gamesblog/2011/aug/22/deus-ex-human-revolution-review\">Human Revolution</a> \u2013 a lavishly depicted near-future thriller \u2013 to widespread critical acclaim, developer Eidos Montreal\u2019s follow up, Mankind Divided, picks up the exact same threads that its predecessor left tantalisingly unanswered five years ago.</p> <p>This is a tall order and its makers clearly recognise it, front-ending the game\u2019s campaign with an almost laughably long 12-minute recap to bring you up to speed on everything Deus Ex. Protagonist Adam Jensen returns \u2013 still half-Lagerfeld, half-Motorola Razr \u2013 working as a special agent at Interpol two years after the events of Human Revolution. Like many, he\u2019s coming to terms with the devastating aftereffects of The Incident \u2013 a cyber-attack that deliberately caused the bio-technologically \u201caugmented\u201d population to turn violent against their will, leaving millions dead. It was a global catalyst, accelerating the divisions between the human and augmented populations, but as thematically charged a setup as this is, Adam and his world can\u2019t help but feel outdated.<br></p> <p>Mankind Divided is undeniably beautiful, soaked in the neon golds and vibrant lights that made its predecessor such a striking spectacle, but its weak opening results in a slow start that never quite gains the momentum it needs. When it does finally get going, some shoddy voice work and awful facial animations make for a game that fails to convey the societal and racial messages that its strong writing attempts to.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"612d6036bb27e74db140f35fd2a1c401ffef4a3e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/612d6036bb27e74db140f35fd2a1c401ffef4a3e/60_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u200bDeus Ex: Mankind Divided\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">After a pre-credits mission in Dubai sets up the game\u2019s central conspiracy, you relocate to Prague.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Worse yet, it offers very few notable opinions on its focal prejudices, and the best it seems to do to force home its messaging is interrupt you with annoying documentation checks between metro stations. There\u2019s racist graffiti on the walls, slurs get shouted as you walk through the streets, but the overall result is a social commentary that feels, at best, lacking conviction.</p> <p>After a pre-credits mission in Dubai sets up the game\u2019s central conspiracy, you relocate to Prague; a rich, multifaceted hub full of apartment blocks, a bank, abandoned theatre and underground anti-terrorism facility. Prague never imposes the same visual impact as Human Revolution\u2019s depiction of Hengsha or Detroit, but it is explored and revisited several times in different visual states over the game\u2019s 20-25 hours, and it\u2019s a veritable playground of stuff to do. Between the various metro stations that transport you to each corner of the capital, you\u2019ll find multiple side quests that are multi-part branching path adventures in themselves. There\u2019s a bank break-in to dig up dodgy info on one of the game\u2019s main mega-corps, and an investigation into an underground cult \u2013 finding every possible side story is a completionist dream, and the game makes pursuing these optional plots worthwhile with some great moments that rival the main story.</p> <p>There are a couple of mainline departures from the Czech capital; an infiltration into Golem City \u2013 a cramped, higgledy-piggledy ghetto for the augmented that is by far the game\u2019s most interesting setting \u2013 as well as a recon mission to a facility in the Swiss Alps and a rescue mission in London. Despite these four locations, each far larger than anything in any Deus Ex previously, Mankind Divided doesn\u2019t feel half the grandiose globe-trotter that Human Revolution was. In some ways, this works in the game\u2019s favour, grounding itself to focus its story. In others, it results in a game that\u2019s half-baked, especially after proceedings aren\u2019t so much cut short as they are forcefully cauterised, resulting in the most telegraphed setup for a sequel since 2004\u2019s <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/gamesblog/2004/nov/10/halo2biggest\">Halo 2</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0e374345300c7f1659535d2ad694fffe15128704\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0e374345300c7f1659535d2ad694fffe15128704/116_0_1688_1013/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u200bDeus Ex: Mankind Divided\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Despite an improved control scheme, combat is still the least enjoyable way to play.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But, despite its terrible non-ending and the uninspiring boss fight that triggers it, the game still frequently finds immense strength in its moment-to-moment play. Mankind Divided retains the series\u2019 mechanical tri-force of stealth, hacking and combat, but it does a much better job of blending these different styles \u2013 even if you want to play stealthily, for example, you\u2019ll benefit from investing upgrade points into combat and hacking abilities to benefit from different routes that these styles allow.</p> <p>After setting up a narrative hard-reset of Adam\u2019s abilities, the resulting blank slate lets you experiment with the huge variety of augments and weapons. There\u2019s an invisibility cloak, smart vision for seeing through walls, a set of rebreather lungs for gas immunity, a social enhancer to open up more conversational options at certain points in the game, and lethal and non-lethal weapons aplenty. There are also new \u201coverclock\u201d augments, too, which Jensen uncovers when he undergoes surgery at the beginning of the game, including a gauss wrist attachment that sends enemies flying, a long-range taser, and a remote hacking tool that\u2019s incredibly useful when you\u2019re in a sticky spot. Coupled with your existing playthings, these eight over-clocked augments elevate Mankind Divided\u2019s depth beyond the strong foundations that Human Revolution laid out.</p> <p>This leads to a more fluid role-playing experience, but one which suffers from many of the same pitfalls as its predecessor. Despite an improved control scheme, combat is still the least enjoyable way to play, and shooting just isn\u2019t as satisfying as it needs to be to become your primary choice. Similarly, hacking is still really empowering, allowing you to turn the tide by sabotaging turrets, controlling cameras remotely and manipulating walker robots to turn on your enemies, but the mini-game with which you hack terminals and computers isn\u2019t fun enough to justify how often you\u2019ll be doing it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a38f7283342592364bf9ab1bc6e1f1d9723fb804\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a38f7283342592364bf9ab1bc6e1f1d9723fb804/248_0_3600_2160/1000.png\" alt=\"Deus Ex: Mankind Divided\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The multitude of options at almost every other stage of the game apart from the ending is impressive.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Regardless of this, the open-ended nature of almost all missions means that you\u2019re rarely punished for whichever way you want to play \u2013 you will find that in moments where you have to hack something, for example, it won\u2019t require any upgrades to get past cybersecurity \u2013 and this makes for a game that begs to be played, manipulated and re-explored on several occasions, even despite its uneven core mechanics (something that the game\u2019s New Game Plus encourages, too). It\u2019s a disappointment that the game\u2019s biggest moments don\u2019t seem to have the multitude of outcomes that some of its smaller missions do; its grand finale seems to be the same no matter what your endgame decisions might be, but the multitude of options at almost every other stage of the game is impressive.</p> <p>As a completely separate component from the main story, Breach mode adds time-trial style challenges. It\u2019s by no means a worthy replacement of, you know, the end of the story, but Breach has some cool ideas, online leaderboards and exclusive augmentations that aren\u2019t featured in the main game.</p> <p>It\u2019s a shame that in a world obsessed with the conflict between man and machine, Mankind Divided\u2019s characters feel more robot than human. Hopefully, Eidos Montreal has strong post-release support planned to fill in the absent third act. Regardless of this, the game\u2019s broad level of creative opportunities, memorable infiltrations and beautiful attention to detail in such a visually interesting world make for a game that\u2019s fun to experiment with again and again, despite its structural cracks.</p> <p><strong>PS4, Xbox One and PC; Pegi 18.

Or, indeed, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/aug/12/gonzalo-higuain-football-fans-overweight-players-argentina-juventus\" title=\"\">his pre-season paunch</a>. Higua\u00edn had been left out of the champions\u2019 starting XI against Fiorentina, with even Massimiliano Allegri acknowledging that \u201cGonzalo did not present himself here in ideal condition\u201d\u201a but he came off the bench to snatch an opportunistic goal \u2013 clipped home from a yard out after Sami Khedira\u2019s shot was charged down.</p> <p>The finish was trickier than it looked at a first glance, executed from a tight angle with only a tiny window to slip the ball through, but Juventus fans will have been most pleased simply to see that Higua\u00edn retains his instinct for arriving in the right place at the right time. Afterwards, he encouraged his critics to carry on poking fun at his weight, saying: \u201cThat way I can score every week.\u201d</p> <p>It will be some time yet before we get the full measure of this post-Pogba Juventus team. Higua\u00edn\u2019s talent has never been in doubt, but we still do not know exactly how he fits into Allegri\u2019s tactical plans. The same is true of fellow new signings <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jun/14/miralem-pjanic-completes-32m-transfer-juventus-roma\" title=\"\">Miralem Pjanic</a>, Mehdi Benatia and Marko Pjaca, none of whom made it off the bench.</p> <p>Dani Alves did start at right wing-back, and was a focal point of his team\u2019s play, touching the ball more often than any other player on either team. Tuttosport dubbed him an \u201cinstant idol\u201d, though in reality his was a mixed performance \u2013 full of personality but undermined by too many loose passes.</p> <p>On another day, Juventus \u2013 who took the lead through Khedira, before Nikola Kalinic equalised against the run of play \u2013 would have won this game at a canter.

But if we can say that Higua\u00edn was an asset to Juventus on Saturday, then we might also add that he was missed at Napoli.</p> <p>Caught cold by newly-promoted Pescara, the Partenopei found themselves 2-0 down at half-time. Manolo Gabbiadini cut an isolated figure at the top of the formation, not helped by the fact that Lorenzo Insigne, caught up in a bitter contract dispute, was also well below par.</p> <p>Both players were withdrawn in the 53rd minute, with Dries Mertens coming on to score twice and rescue a point. The Belgian\u2019s angry look towards the bench after the first betrayed his frustration at always being used as an impact substitute. Napoli, plainly, have questions to answer between now and the end of the transfer window, with Kalidou Koulibaly also unsettled and agitating for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/10/chelsea-target-kalidou-koulibalys-future-to-be-resolved-this-week\" title=\"\">a move to Chelsea</a>.</p> <p>Pescara, though, were a pleasure to watch, and look better equipped to compete at this level they did on their previous brief stay in the top-flight. The Manchester-born Libya international, Ahmad Benali, in particular, caught the eye \u2013 opening the scoring in the eighth minute and continuing to sparkle thereafter from his position behind the attack.</p> <p>If Pescara\u2019s manager, Massimo Oddo, feels any frustration at failing to protect a two-goal lead, then he can at least rest assured that his team are in good company. His former club Lazio were 3-0 up and cruising away to Atalanta after an hour, but ultimately only scraped a 4-3 win with the help of an 89th-minute goal from Danilo Cataldi.</p> <p>The tension of a helter-skelter finish at the Stadio Atleti Azzurri d\u2019Italia was only heightened when assistant referee Stefano Alassio collapsed and was carried off on a stretcher. Only later did we learn that he had been experiencing chest pains and was taken directly to hospital.</p> <p>At San Siro, too, there was late drama as Milan \u2013 another club Oddo used to play for \u2013 threatened to throw away all their hard work against Torino. Carlos Bacca\u2019s first career hat-trick had given the Rossoneri a 3-1 lead after 90 minutes, but by the 95th they had conceded another goal and given away a penalty.</p> <p>They were rescued by goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma, who plunged to his left to push away Andrea Belotti\u2019s spot-kick. As a piece of sporting narrative, this was almost too perfect. Torino are managed by Sinisa Mihajlovic \u2013 the same man who dared to give the goalkeeper his break at Milan last season, when Donnarumma was still only 16 years old.</p> <p>\u201cIf I\u2019d known this would happen then I would never have given him his debut,\u201d said Mihajlovic afterwards.</p> <p>That, though, is the problem with beginnings.

Edin Dzeko added his name to the scoresheet when he side-footed home the third goal from close range, but his imprecision in front of goal both here and in the Champions League play-off first leg draw with Porto last week remains a cause for concern. At least Luciano Spalletti knows Diego Perotti can be relied upon from the penalty spot.</p> <p>\u2022 Chievo picked up where they left off last season with a fine opening weekend win over Internazionale. Having already put his team ahead, Valter Birsa tied up the points with what was probably <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PremiumSportHD/status/767482872445800448\" title=\"\">the best goal of the opening weekend</a>, swung violently into the corner from just beyond the D. Frank de Boer has said all along that he will need time to impose his ideas for the <em>Nerazzurri</em>, but Andrea Ranocchia\u2019s familiar failings at the back will not be easy to resolve.</p> <p>\u2022 Federico Chiesa, son of the former Italy striker Enrico, made his debut for Fiorentina on Saturday \u2013 14 years after his father\u2019s last appearance for the same club. Juventus Stadium is a daunting place to begin your senior career, and he struggled to make an impact against Giorgio Chiellini et al, but it shows how highly he is regarded that he was given the nod ahead of such players as Cristian Tello or Giuseppe Rossi on the right of attack. Oh, and Gheorghe Hagi\u2019s son Ianis was on the bench for the Viola, too.</p> <p>\u2022 Rossi\u2019s role in Florence remains a sore subject, and he was disappointed to once again find himself excluded from Paulo Sousa\u2019s starting XI on Saturday. Although the player does not fit naturally into his manager\u2019s preferred 4-3-3, the impression is that they have not seen eye to eye on a personal level, either. Don\u2019t rule out another move for Rossi before the end of this transfer window.</p> <p><strong>Results:</strong> Atalanta 3-4 Lazio, Bologna 1-0 Crotone, Chievo 2-0 Internazionale, Empoli 0-1 Sampdoria, Genoa 3-1 Cagliari, Juventus 2-1 Fiorentina, Milan 3-2 Torino, Palermo 0-1 Sassuolo, Pescara 2-2 Napoli, Roma 4-0 Udinese.</p>",

  "<p>On Tuesday 9 August, Saddam Hussein Abdu al-Burai said goodbye to his wife, pregnant with their first child, and left home to make the 10km journey to a Yemen snack-food factory inside an industrial complex in the Alnahda district of the capital, Sana\u2019a. It was his first day at work but at 9.30am, barely two hours after he had begun manually counting the potato bags inside the steel girder compound, a Saudi-led airstrike began.</p> <p>Burai was killed on the spot along with six other men and three women. The attack on the potato crisp factory <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/09/saudi-led-airstrikes-yemen-food-factory-kill-people\">came during the first airstrike</a> by the Saudi-led coalition against Houthi rebels since the collapse of UN-brokered peace talks earlier this month. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bd0e3087c2fed2ea35f558a96c4faec39f160627\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bd0e3087c2fed2ea35f558a96c4faec39f160627/0_93_4707_2824/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Workers clean up after a hospital operated by MSF in Abs was hit by a Saudi-led airstrike.

Houthi fighters, belonging to the Zaydi sect of Shia Islam, are allied with the former president Ali Abdullah Saleh and control Sana\u2019a and vast swaths of territory in western Yemen. </p> <p>The Saudi coalition has been criticised by the UN and human rights groups for airstrikes that hit civilian targets. In the case of the blast that killed Burai, a Houthi-controlled military maintenance camp was located approximately 20 metres south of the crisp factory, separated by two large walls. The airstrikes, instead of hitting the military camp, struck the middle of the factory, where about 60 people were working the morning shift.</p> <p>Abdulrahman Saleh Abdu Salah, a 26-year-old electrician, was charging his mobile phone in the manager\u2019s office when a huge blast rocked the building. He was one of the lucky ones. \u201cSuddenly we heard a massive explosion and everything started to fall on us, even the wall fell on us,\u201d he told the Guardian. \u201cI stood up and went back to the factory, I saw everyone was scattered on the floor and some people were killed on the spot because of shrapnel and the place started to burn.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI saw one of my colleagues near the machine I was fixing and he was jumping and shouting out in pain \u2013 he was the only one I could help and I took him outside. Minutes later the whole place was on fire and people were killed and their bodies were burned.\u201d</p> <p>Salah said he thanked God that he survived the attack, which left many of his friends dead. His best friend, Mostafa Aqeel, was among 13 workers injured and is still in hospital. Five are in intensive care and one is in a coma. Salah said he did not understand why the Saudi-led coalition targeted civilians. </p> <p>\u201cWhy did they target us?\u201d he asked. \u201cIt\u2019s a snack-food factory. No weapons, no bombs, no fighters are inside. Only men and women workers.\u201d The factory, which was established in 1985, has now closed down. <br></p> <p>Both sides in the conflict have since escalated their attacks, with a recent airstrike by the Saudi-led coalition <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/15/saudi-led-air-strike-yemen-hospital-kills-at-least-seven\">hitting a hospital supported by M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res</a> in the Abs district of Hajjah governorate, in north-west Yemen. That attack, the fourth against an MSF facility in less than a year, killed at least 11 including an MSF staff member. It prompted MSF to announce earlier this week that it would withdraw from six hospitals in northern Yemen. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c01e21c2bacb7bb5b338a55d2d26c11276372ca1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c01e21c2bacb7bb5b338a55d2d26c11276372ca1/0_154_4928_2957/1000.jpg\" alt=\"People inspect the damage in a room at an hospital operated by the the Paris-based aid agency, Doctors Without Borders in Abs.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">People inspect the damage in a room at an hospital operated by the the Paris-based aid agency, Doctors Without Borders in Abs.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: STRINGER/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Houthis have retaliated by firing missiles across the border, which has also resulted in civilian deaths. </p> <p>Juan Prieto, MSF Yemen\u2019s head of mission, said it has become difficult to operate in Yemen. He condemned the attacks on the hospitals and said he did not understand why they kept happening. The coalition has accused Houthis of hiding military equipment and personnel in public places such as schools and hospitals. A recent school attack in the Haydan district in northern Saada governorate killed 10 students who were all under 15. </p> <p>\u201cIn the facilities that we have been running our services, we can guarantee that there has not been any military activity,\u201d he told the Guardian by phone from Sana\u2019a. \u201cWe have been following all the rules that [the Saudis] have set up and the attacks continue happening, we are wondering why. There is a lack of respect.\u201d</p> <p>Prieto said the situation in Yemen was deteriorating, especially people\u2019s access to food and water. \u201cThe system cannot cope with the need at all,\u201d he said. More than 6,000 people have been killed since the conflict began \u2013 half of them civilians and more than 1,100 of them children, according to the UN.</p> <p>The UN chief, Ban Ki-moon, called on both sides three times last week to end the violence. \u201cCivilians, including children, are paying the heaviest price in the ongoing conflict, as civilian infrastructure, such as schools and hospitals, continue to be hit,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Maha Nagi, a 30-year-old based in Sana\u2019a who works in the humanitarian field, said most people had lost their jobs and had difficulty coping with the basic cost of living, while others had been displaced and struggled to find a place to sleep. She said that since the collapse of the peace talks there have been five to 10 airstrikes in Sana\u2019a and its vicinity every day. <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0ddf291cb7084990340dec3eee90bd377ce17c2a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0ddf291cb7084990340dec3eee90bd377ce17c2a/0_118_3543_2126/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A child who was wounded during a reported Saudi-led coalition air strike on a Koranic school.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A child who was wounded during a reported Saudi-led coalition air strike on a Koranic school.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mohammed Huwais/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWhat is new this time is that they are not only targeting military places but they also hit family houses,\u201d she said. \u201cI blame all parties because they only care about victory and defeating others to win more power and I blame Saudi Arabia for intervening and making it worse.

We want to be safe and not be killed by Saudi jets,\u201d Nagi said. She said healthcare was bad and there was no public electricity in Sana\u2019a. \u201cYou can either use a generator or solar power.\u201d</p> <p>Sana\u2019a-based political analyst Hisham Al-Omeisy said airstrikes in recent weeks had become more indiscriminate. He said that while the Houthis were \u201cguilty of hijacking and mismanaging the state\u201d, it was the Saudi-led coalition that had \u201cheld the whole nation hostage to the current conflict and [had] been collectively and indiscriminately punishing\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe Saudi-led coalition imposing a commercial blockade was not only devastating, it was catastrophic,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s no winning this war militarily. The Operation Decisive Storm, which was presumed would take weeks, is now a 16-month-old protracted conflict. Yemen is on a fast lane to disintegrating as a state, and when Aqap [al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula] and Islamic State are actively expanding footholds in the growing ungoverned areas, soon we\u2019ll see a Syria scenario on steroids.\u201d</p> <p>Ahmed Abdullah Hashem Jahaf, 27-year-old graphic designer, took his wife and son out of the country in the first months of the conflict, but has returned many times. \u201cI stayed alone trying to understand what\u2019s going on in my country. I lost many people in my family and friends in this war. Even I can\u2019t count how many exactly,\u201d he said. \u201cThese days the situation has returned to the early days of the war, fighting and constant shelling in several areas, no airports, no ports and no electricity \u2026 The future in Yemen is unknown but I am afraid it will be a scary and dangerous future, not only for Yemen, but the whole of the area.\u201d</p> <p>Ibrahim Abdulkareem lost his 11-month-old daughter, Zainab, when an airstrike hit his house in Western Al-Jeraf in Al-Thawra district more than a year ago.

The film chronicles a public birthday celebration for Castile, as well as an intimate gathering where friends and family light birthday candles on a cake bearing his image and share memories and thoughts about his life.</p> <p>\u201cI just got the sense that there was so much these folks wanted to get off their chest,\u201d Gorjestani said, adding that often the family\u2019s only chances to speak after events like this come with \u201cmicrophones shoved in their faces\u201d and through lawyers and other intermediaries. Gorjestani said the film-makers were attempting to capture some of Castile\u2019s friends and family\u2019s experiences in \u201ccomfortable environments where they could speak from an unguarded space a little\u201d.</p> <p>In the film, Castile\u2019s lifelong friend \u201cWax\u201d says: \u201cThe one thing about him that I soaked from [Castile] was: \u2018Play it by the books.\u2019 You want to drive? Get your license. You want to carry [a firearm]? This is the route you take to get your license to carry.\u201d </p> <p>The 32-year-old was shot by officer <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/17/philando-castile-shooting-minnesota-police-chief-defends-officer-jeronimo-yanez\">Jeronimo Yanez</a> during a traffic stop on 6 July for a broken taillight. Castile\u2019s fiancee, Diamond Reynolds, began livestreaming the aftermath of the shooting on Facebook moments after, telling internet viewers that the officer had shot Castile when he reached to retrieve his wallet after having informed the officer that he was carrying a legal concealed weapon. The shooting, less than 48 hours after the shooting death of Alton Sterling in Baton Rouge, which was also captured on video, helped to ignite a firestorm of outrage and protest around the country. The incident remains under investigation.</p> <p>One of the things that stood out to Pullinger in telling the story was how much the police appeared to be a part of the community. \u201cThe family members were like: \u2018Look, this is a tight-knit community, we all have family and friends that are in the police.\u2019 The police there are generally from the community. There wasn\u2019t this \u2018we hate the police\u2019 kind of attitude. This is really just about justice and looking at this fairly for whether there was injustice,\u201d Pullinger, the producer, said.</p> <p>The film opens with a circle of community members in prayer. To the right of the man leading the prayer is a young black woman wearing a Black Lives Matter shirt. On his left is a police officer. Community members and police can be seen embracing in the next scene.</p> <p>The film-makers have also completed a film on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/feb/12/mario-woods-autopsy-san-francisco-police-fatal-shooting\">Mario Woods</a>, who was killed by police in San Francisco on 2 December, which they expect to release shortly after the Castile film.</p> <p>Ephraim Walker, one of the executive producers of the film, who also worked on the movie Fruitvale Station, said this may not be the last one, either. \u201cI think we\u2019re interested in telling this as a series because I think that by telling individual stories, you can get at the heart of a much bigger problem and help people understand why it\u2019s important.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>It is two months since British voters surprised themselves by deciding to end the UK\u2019s 43-year relationship with the European Union \u2013 \u201cindependence day\u201d to some and \u201cthe worst political decision since 1945\u201d to others. </p> <p>As stunned political leaderships on both sides of the Channel continue dithering about what to do next, it is worth looking back at the origins of a crisis the EU elite had not expected.</p> <p>1) It may have started with Harold Macmillan\u2019s father taking the future prime minister to watch Queen Victoria\u2019s diamond jubilee parade in 1897. Aged just three, Macmillan was very impressed by its splendour, but years later he would tell audiences that the pomp and power had been \u201call an illusion\u201d. Two world wars (Macmillan was wounded in both) and the Great Depression put paid to it. The answer was a Europe that replaced old enmities with cooperation, he decided. But in 1955 Anthony Eden was PM and clung to old illusions. His government sent no minister \u2013 only a middling trade official named Russell Bretherton \u2013 to the summit in Messina, Italy, that led to the 1957 <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Rome\">Treaty of Rome</a>. Britain missed the boat. The French president, Charles de Gaulle, regarded Britain as an American Trojan horse and vetoed Macmillan\u2019s first bid to join in 1963 and Harold Wilson\u2019s in 1967.</p> <p>2) After De Gaulle\u2019s retirement, Ted Heath achieved entry for Britain on 1 January 1973, splitting both the Labour and Tory parties in the process. Key policies such as fishing and farming had not been designed to meet UK needs, and some people were worried about pooling aspects of sovereignty with the \u201cCommon Market\u201d six. They were now nine, as Ireland and Denmark joined too, but Norwegians voted against membership. Heath was a hopeless salesman. When he lost power in 1974, Labour\u2019s Wilson embraced Tony Benn\u2019s idea of a referendum to legitimise British membership. With most of Fleet Street and the new Tory leader, Margaret Thatcher, on his side, Wilson won heavily by a margin of two to one against a coalition of rightwing Tories, Bennites and much of the Labour movement. Union leaders saw the economically booming Europe as a capitalist plot.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p> 3) The Common Market evolved into the European Economic Community (EEC) and <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_state_of_the_European_Union#Enlargement\">membership expanded</a>, taking in former dictatorships Spain, Greece and Portugal in the 1980s, neutrals and ex-Soviet bloc countries after the end of the cold war. It would be 28 in all when Croatia joined in 2013. To keep growing, Europe needed to reduce tariff barriers and in 1986 signed the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_European_Act\">Single European Act</a> (SEA), which committed members to free movement of goods, capital, services and people in a \u201csingle market\u201d by 1992. Acknowledging emerging fears of a \u201cdemocratic deficit\u201d, the SEA also gave the elected European parliament greater powers. But it also replaced national vetoes with qualified majority voting on many decisions in the EEC\u2019s council of ministers. Denmark\u2019s parliament rejected the SEA, but it was endorsed by a referendum, as it was in Ireland. An opponent of referendums, Thatcher did not hold a British referendum and only later regretted that she had been deceived by the \u201cfederalist conveyor belt\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1dcadfb6850f40cd0ceb32b49413293fa31fdbfb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1dcadfb6850f40cd0ceb32b49413293fa31fdbfb/387_132_1624_974/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Margaret Thatcher\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Margaret Thatcher made her Bruges speech in 1988 opposing economic and political union</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ANL/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>4) The next signpost on the road to what EU integrationists hoped would be \u201cever closer union\u201d was to set up a single currency. By now Thatcher was vocally against such a move and in 1988 made her <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/1988/sep/21/emu.theeuro\">Bruges speech</a> opposing economic and political union, but backing cooperation between nation states. (It was not meant as a Brexit speech, aides would stress in 2016). Meanwhile Labour\u2019s modernisers, led by Neil Kinnock, had reversed the party\u2019s opposition to EU membership. They had been wooed by the vision of a high-wage workers\u2019 Europe promoted by Jacques Delors, the visionary French socialist who was president of the powerful Brussels bureaucracy, the European commission. After the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 opened up the prospect of German reunification, the French insisted on a currency union to tie an ever more dominant Germany to the EU project. Britain wanted the project to be \u201cbroader, not deeper\u201d by expanding eastwards. Both policies were implemented; both would later have fateful consequences.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>5) As Thatcher\u2019s power weakened she quarrelled with key allies such as Geoffrey Howe and Nigel Lawson over Europe. But her new chancellor, John Major, persuaded her to link sterling to the European exchange rate mechanism (ERM) at what some feared was too high a rate for British industry. When Thatcher fell, Major took over and negotiated British opt-outs from the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maastricht_Treaty\">Maastricht treaty</a> (1992), which reorganised the EU and set timetables and rules for a single currency zone and for the no-passport Schengen zone. As part of Major\u2019s \u201cvariable geometry\u201d strategy for a two-speed Europe, Britain was also allowed not to join the \u201csocial chapter\u201d covering workers\u2019 rights. Denmark needed two referendums before signing; France\u2019s was only narrowly carried. Major won the 1992 election, but opposition to Europe crystallised at this time into demands for an in/out referendum on UK membership. The sterling crisis of September 1992 forced Britain out of the ERM. The economy recovered, but not Major\u2019s reputation. What became Ukip was founded and Major\u2019s government was hobbled by backbench \u201cEurosceptic\u201d rebellions, billionaire Jimmy Goldsmith\u2019s <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referendum_Party\">Referendum party</a> and Thatcher\u2019s criticisms. BSE (\u201cmad cow disease\u201d) turned into an ugly beef war with Europe.</p> <p>6) Major\u2019s EU problems helped Tony Blair pile up a 179-seat majority in 1997 as the most pro-European PM since Heath. Labour talked a positive game on Europe, but Fleet Street had moved against it in line with rightwing public opinion, and Blair never dared expend much political capital making the positive case for Europe. Instead his turf war with Gordon Brown ensured that the chancellor imposed a near-impossible \u201cfive tests\u201d of the British national interest before he would consent to sterling joining the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro\">euro</a>, whose coins and notes were launched in 2002. Labour joined the \u201csocial chapter\u201d that Major had blocked, but fell out with most of its EU partners over UK support for the US-led invasion of Iraq. The French were denounced as \u201ccheese-eating surrender monkeys\u201d.</p> <p>7) Serious strategic mistakes were then made on both sides of the Channel. Labour decided not to impose transitional restrictions on the free movement of workers when mostly former Soviet bloc states known as the A10 joined the EU on 1 May 2004, unaware that France and Germany would do so. Instead of the estimated 13,000 annual arrivals expected, mostly from Poland, more than a million came in the years that followed. It allowed Ukip to capitalise on fears of wage competition, pressure on social services and cultural resentment in many areas, pushing the Tories to the right. Labour failed to respond to fears shared by many of its supporters. Tony Blair promised a referendum on the EU \u201cconstitution\u201d but ducked it when French and Dutch voters said no. Resentment grew when a version of the constitution became the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Lisbon\">Lisbon treaty</a> (2009).<br></p> <p>8) When the global banking crisis began in mid-2007, initially in France and Britain, it was blamed by many in Brussels on irresponsible \u201cAnglo-Saxon\u201d speculative banking. But US and British central bankers proved much more nimble in restructuring and bailing out troubled banks than the EU did at both national and eurozone level. At Germany\u2019s insistence, a tough line was taken against eurozone states, notably Greece, Ireland, Spain and Portugal \u2013 \u201cperipheral\u201d economies that had borrowed heavily on the new currency\u2019s credibility to launch unsustainable booms. The subsequent austerity regime crippled Greece and killed growth elsewhere. Free to devalue and with flexible labour laws, Britain was able to navigate the crisis more adroitly. Badly hit by the rising economic power of Asia, the eurozone looked less like an engine of growth than one of stagnation, and some of its banks a submerged problem that leaders tried to ignore.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9d038a7941534fef2018f6dfffc70b1a4fd9f915\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9d038a7941534fef2018f6dfffc70b1a4fd9f915/0_228_4096_2457/1000.jpg\" alt=\"David Cameron\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">David Cameron hoped he could sell the economic case for continued EU membership.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Facundo Arrizabalaga/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>9) David Cameron had won the Tory leadership in 2005 by outflanking his main rival, David Davis, over Europe, promising to quit the main conservative group of MEPs. After becoming prime minister in 2010 he talked tough, but Eurosceptic colleagues never trusted him and used his appeasement tactics to demand more. Despite investing less effort and manpower at the Brussels negotiating table, Britain was winning key battles, its language had now replaced French, its approach to law and free trade gained ground and it was outside the floundering eurozone and Schengen\u2019s border free-for-all. It was already half out. But that was not enough for critics. Ahead of the 2015 election Cameron promised an in/out referendum after a \u201crenegotiation\u201d (the tactic Wilson had used in 1975), probably expecting Nick Clegg to veto it again in a renewed coalition. Instead he won an outright majority and decided to resolve the issue early, in 2016 rather than 2017.<br></p> <p>10) Cameron\u2019s elevation of party management tactics over strategy was rapidly compounded by a perfect storm for what became known as the Brexit campaign. Tory promises to reduce net immigration from about 300,000 to below 100,000 repeatedly failed, weaponising the \u201cTake Back Control\u201d slogan. Middle East wars (in which British action and inaction made things worse) compounded the economic and asylum migration flow. The spread of Islamic fundamentalist terrorism into Europe added fresh fears to the mix. The eurozone was easily portrayed as a basket case in which failed EU policies were stirring up the very extremism the union had been devised to prevent. Yet the cross-party remain camp\u2019s lacklustre campaign clung to the economic case for membership, revealing an arrogant metropolitan disdain for voters\u2019 fears on immigration in less prosperous regions. </p> <p>Cameron thought he could keep the wavering Boris Johnson onside. Instead the London mayor became leave\u2019s biggest campaign draw, willing to deploy some of its most unscrupulous claims about migration (\u201cTurkey is joining the EU\u201d) and budget savings (\u201c\u00a3350m a week for the NHS\u201d). Cameron had also banked on strong Labour backing. But the official opposition had elected Jeremy Corbyn, a lifelong anti-European, as its leader. He declared for Europe, but millions barely noticed his feeble contribution. Nor did they believe remain\u2019s warnings of the dangers of a leave vote, some too crude to impress anyone, some from foreign VIPs like Barack Obama. In the brave new world of Brexit, Michael Gove spoke for the 52% to 48% majority on 23 June when he said: \u201cI think people in this country have had enough of experts.\u201d<br></p> <p>It wasn\u2019t quite the outcome Macmillan had in mind when he denounced imperial illusions and sought refuge in Europe.

Theresa May and Nicola Sturgeon each has a semi fringe (May has a complicated fringe-with-a-side-parting while Sturgeon\u2019s is brushed out wispily above the eyes). </p> <p>In the world of celebrity, the fringe has denoted comebacks and autonomy. Selena Gomez grew one as she reasserted herself post-Justin Bieber and as a post-Disney popstar while Ariana Grande wore one, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jul/25/ariana-grande-donut-licking-white-house-gala\">post donut-licking gate</a>, to indicate her good girl turned bad status.

It\u2019s the look of the wallflower who uses it as a cloak of invisibility. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jul/03/bat-for-lashes-the-bride-natasha-khan-review\">Bat For Lashes</a> has called her fringe a \u201cblack nocturnal shield\u201d, useful for times when you \u201cdon\u2019t want to look at people\u201d. This shy, verging-on-innocent, look is something that has been referenced by the likes of Doris Day, Jane Birkin, Velma from Scooby Doo and Stevie Nicks. Interesting too, is the semaphoring indicated by those who have referenced both sides of the fringing coin, a troubled innocence turned into power (Nico, Dusty Springfield, Ronnie Spector). As part of her <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/may/10/stylewatch-hole-in-1995\">kinderwhore</a> style, Courtney Love in Hole deconstructed this idea. She mixed a fringe with subversive takes on babydoll dresses, knee length school socks and tiaras. </p> <p>This year, the fringe is no longer about hiding, it\u2019s the Alpha, assertive cut that\u2019s about being fully present and in complete control. </p>",
  "<p><strong>Hometown:</strong> Stockholm.<br></p> <p><strong>The lineup:</strong> Erika Soldh Ahlstr\u00f6m (lead vocals, voice pedal/loop), Marta Pettersson (lead vocals, keyboards). </p> <p><strong>The background:</strong> How good is Scandinavian pop? So good that, just as we were deciding to feature superb rising Swedish duo I Am Karate, another record, this time from Denmark, arrived at the New band of the day office that was <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpiuX8GfQJo\">every bit as deserving of this space</a>. The pop dominance and excellence of that region <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/nov/12/scandiravia-who-are-the-new-nordic-pop-stars\">continues apace</a>. Something about their distance from the fray evidently gives them the perspective and freedom required to fashion \u2013 contrive, even \u2013 immaculate pop. </p> <p>I Am Karate martial their artistry with aplomb. They will chop your head off, in the nicest possible way, with their marvellously maudlin and mordantly mellow mid-tempo melodies. These are songs about the destructive power of relationships, designed for <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nd7pIZcwVU8\">love and dancing</a>, to quote the great bard Sir Philip Oakey. IAK are bang up to date, while also nodding to earlier developments in electronic music, from dubstep to R&amp;B. It\u2019s shimmering, spacious synthpop with a commercial sheen and rough experimental edges, for fans of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/grimes\">Grimes</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/aug/09/new-band-saint-lou-lou\">Saint Lou Lou</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/mar/06/mo-danish-punk-activist-pop-star\">M\u00f8</a>. As with most of the best Nordic pop, it could come from the US, Britain, anywhere, although connoisseurs will take one listen to the soulful \u2013 not glutinous or gloopy but coolly impassioned \u2013 vocals and polished production and think, \u201cThat\u2019s Swedish.\u201d</p> <p>Actually, it comes from Nacka, near Stockholm \u2013 in a house that singer and keyboardist Marta Pettersson lives in with five others. It isn\u2019t, she insists, a shared home but a collective. \u201cWe do the groceries together, cook together, eat together and watch movies together,\u201d she explains. \u201cIt\u2019s more like a family. A religious commune? No. We\u2019re all just normal people.\u201d</p> <p>The house is where the sharing ends. I Am Karate solely belong to Pettersson and project partner Erika Soldh Ahlstr\u00f6m, who is joint lead singer and uses a pedal and loop station to manipulate her voice and assorted sounds. They both handle the writing, producing, singing and playing. They don\u2019t have a studio as such, just Pettersson\u2019s bedroom, where she keeps her laptop, sound-card, microphone, Midi keyboard, Logic software and guitar. Asked whether it matches the equipment used by so-called successful professionals, she cites St Vincent\u2019s 2011 album <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/sep/11/st-vincent-strange-mercy-review\">Strange Mercy</a>, whose drums were, Pettersson believes, all computerised, as well as the intro music to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8PKcNGcuI\">Game of Thrones</a>. \u201cIt sounds expensive, like a whole orchestra, but it\u2019s just one cello playing for real and the other stuff is Midi-based,\u201d she says, realising she may have just dissed GoT composer Ramin Djawadi. \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019ve heard, anyway.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"I Am Karate\">  <iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/251413032&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;visual=true\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Pettersson finds interviews in English hard work, but her and Ahlstr\u00f6m\u2019s all-Anglo lyrics for I Am Karate are effortless, pitch-perfect examinations of affairs of the heart. \u201cHow could I be so brainless?\u201d they sing on All Good, from the In Thin Air EP. They have, she says, very different voices. \u201cMine is more indie \u2013 crispy.\u201d Crispy? \u201cFragile. Erika\u2019s is more like a Katy Perry-type voice.\u201d Would Ahlstr\u00f6m beat her on X Factor? \u201cYes.\u201d Back to that \u201cbrainless\u201d lyric \u2026 \u201cWe struggle with writing English sometimes,\u201d she admits, inadvertently alighting upon the appeal of IAK\u2019s words \u2013 they sometimes get them a little bit wrong, which makes them seem even more right, if that makes sense. \u201cIt\u2019s not our mother language,\u201d she adds. \u201cOften we\u2019re, like, \u2018Can we really say this?\u2019 We just try and speak our feelings directly.\u201d Discussing relationships in a foreign language must be especially tricky. \u201cIt\u2019s not that hard,\u201d Pettersson replies, honestly. \u201cWe want to write in English because we want to reach more people than just Swedes.\u201d</p> <p>All Good is about \u201cfeeling really low and stuck inside your head with all these bad thoughts looping around, when you just need somebody to say, \u2018Hey, let it go, it\u2019s all good.\u2019\u201d Bitter addresses the problem of wanting to be with the wrong person \u201cbecause they\u2019re exciting and everyone else is boring\u201d. Bloom and Lock concern, respectively, cruelty and commitment. The pulsating Swayze is particularly poignant: it\u2019s about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2016/mar/29/how-ghosting-became-phenomenon-in-modern-dating) (geddit? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cf6WH8zYmO0\">\u201cghosting\u201d</a>. Pettersson has been the victim of the modern phenomenon. \u201cI have had a serious couple of dates and then the person just suddenly disappeared \u2013 no texts, nothing. And its like, \u2018What?\u2019 I told Erika and she said, \u2018You\u2019ve been ghosted!\u2019 I looked it up and I was like, \u2018Wow, this has to be a song.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>I Am Karate\u2019s heroes are Robyn (Marta) and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/oct/15/susanne-sundfor-ten-love-songs-made-me-feel-naked\">Susanne Sundf\u00f8r </a>(Erika). \u201cShe\u2019s like this pop queen,\u201d says Pettersson of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/robyn\">Robyn</a>. \u201cShe is so strong and she has this beautiful melodic language. It\u2019s simple yet perfect.\u201d She\u2019s never met her but guesses that, if she did, she\u2019d lose the ability to speak. I Am Karate aren\u2019t exactly strangers to fandom back home, where they have appeared on daytime TV, and children are known to hum their music in the playground. \u201cI have a teacher friend and she tells me her kids sing our songs at break,\u201d Pettersson says, proudly. Sometimes, IAK get carried away by their own greatness and it all goes slightly awry. \u201cWe sang one of our songs at karaoke one night and it sounded really bad,\u201d reveals Pettersson. \u201cA friend filmed it so we had to force her to delete it, in case she put it on YouTube.\u201d They didn\u2019t employ martial arts, but at least one of them could have. \u201cErika is a black-belt in Taekwondo,\u201d notes Pettersson. \u201c\u2018Karate means \u2018empty hand\u2019 \u2013 you come in peace and use no weapons, but you can defend yourself if necessary.\u201d So Ahlstr\u00f6m could beat her in a fight? \u201cDefinitely,\u201d she says, and she laughs so loud she might wake the collective. \u201cShe could beat me in singing and fighting.\u201d </p> <p><strong>The buzz:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.thefourohfive.com/music/article/swedish-duo-i-am-karate-keep-the-momentum-with-lock-146\">\u201cBrilliant mid-tempo gems.\u201d</a> </p> <p><strong>The truth:</strong> Another great Nordic pop act, out of thin air. </p> <p><strong>Most likely to:</strong> Appear in the charts. </p> <p><strong>Least likely to:</strong> Suddenly disappear from our lives. </p> <p><strong>What to buy: </strong>The In Thin Air EP is out now on Universal. </p> <p><strong>File next to:</strong> M\u00d8, Saint Lou Lou, Grimes, Kate Boy. </p> <p><strong>Links: </strong><a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/i-am-karate\">soundcloud.com/i-am-karate</a></p> <p><strong>Ones to watch</strong>: Bricc Baby, Michael Christmas, Lester Fitzpatrick, the Dream Life, Trudy and the Romance.</p> <p><strong><br></strong><br></p>",
  "<p> The Well Baby clinic in Buchanan is busy. But that\u2019s not unusual. The clinic, a two-hour drive from Liberia\u2019s capital, Monrovia, sees between 700 and 1,000 mothers and children each week.</p> <p>Nurse Cellian Fahncole sits in a consulting room off the main waiting room. She<strong> </strong>is examining a baby girl and<strong> </strong>asking the mother a series of questions, checking the responses against a list. \u201cI am asking, \u2018Does the child have fever and for how long? Is the fever accompanied by other symptoms?\u2019 I refer to my book and check for danger signs, which are highlighted in pink. If there is any one of the danger signs, I know that I need to refer the child to a hospital,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Fahncole is using a system of diagnosis in which midwives and nurses in 77 health facilities across three counties were recently trained.</p> <p>\u201cThe mother said the child was coughing so I did a breath count on the child, measuring how many breaths per minute, but the breath count did not fall into the pink zone on my check list so I know that was not serious.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"2302e708e83414d6da3f62ec80ff41da0b945995\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2302e708e83414d6da3f62ec80ff41da0b945995/0_384_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cellian Fahncole at the well baby clinic that she runs in Buchanan.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cellian Fahncole at the well baby clinic she runs in Buchanan</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kate Holt</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThe same with diarrhoea. She had it but it wasn\u2019t threatening her life. I asked, \u2018Is she drinking normally? Is she thirsty all the time?\u2019 If it showed symptoms of dehydration, then I go to that column and explore that aspect in more detail. But she didn\u2019t have more than two of the signs, so I was able to rule it out. It helps me know I am making good decisions.\u201d</p> <p>The system is being introduced by the international health organisation <a href=\"https://www.jhpiego.org/\">Jhpiego</a>, which has supported the mother and baby clinic since the Ebola crisis.<br></p> <p>Jhpiego, an affiliate of Johns Hopkins University in Maryland, US, provided training on how to use protective equipment for staff during the Ebola epidemic. It now offers wider medical staff training and, crucially, the introduction of standardised systems of care designed to better spot and treat illnesses.</p> <p>The new system is part of a global push to better <a href=\"http://www.who.int/maternal_child_adolescent/topics/child/imci/en/\">manage childhood illness</a>.</p> <p>\u201cIt was difficult for our government to standardise healthcare; they do not have the resources. The best thing that Jhpiego has done here, aside from giving us protective kit during Ebola, is training us. I feel now that we have the best knowledge to help people. We really didn\u2019t have that before,\u201d says Fahncole.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"1720c8834139643900040f5d679f8f3e235c9cd5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1720c8834139643900040f5d679f8f3e235c9cd5/0_0_5760_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Satto Johnson is a county health programme officer at the well baby clinic in Buchanan\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Satto Johnson is a county health programme officer at the Well Baby clinic in Buchanan.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kate Holt</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The training is really helping nurses, says Satto Johnson, a county health officer. Until recently she worked as a nurse in a government-run hospital that faced huge difficulties providing care where there is a chronic lack of equipment and expertise.</p> <p>Johnson adds: \u201cOnce I had three patients needing oxygen and only one oxygen tank, so I kept having to move it between the three of them. That kind of thing is really tough when all you want to do is help people but you can\u2019t. At the hospital only the bosses used to get any training, never the nurses. But now every level of worker gets it. It has really helped us to stay on top.\u201d</p> <p>Babygryl is at the clinic with her daughter Ellis for vaccinations. It cost her 25 Liberian dollars (about 20p) and took two hours to get here by motorbike taxi. When she arrived she asked for paracetamol because Ellis had a fever. Normally, the fever would have prevented staff from vaccinating her. But rather than letting her go, nurses have kept her at the clinic all day, regularly bathing her in a bid to bring down her fever.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not ideal,\u201d explains a nurse. \u201cBut if we let her go she probably won\u2019t come back so we want to see if we can bring down the child\u2019s temperature enough to safely vaccinate her. I am also a little concerned about the mother\u2019s health. When I was talking to her I could see she sounded a little depressed, so we want to assess her too.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/08/archive-5-zip/giv-31075c9cYRDkaIBJQ/\" data-alt=\"Liberia factbox\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/08/archive-5-zip/giv-31075c9cYRDkaIBJQ/\">Liberia factbox</a> </figure>  <p>The clinic is streamlining its services for women. In the past if a woman came to have a baby vaccinated, she would be told to come back on another day if she also needed family planning. Attempts are now being made to identify and serve all a woman\u2019s needs in one visit.</p> <p> Jamyah, 17, came to the clinic for antenatal care but was also offered family planning advice by a specialist worker. She says she didn\u2019t know about family planning \u201cso it is good to learn this today\u201d.</p> <p>Stephen E James, the local director for community health, says he\u2019s confident that standardised systems could be key to helping Liberia withstand another Ebola outbreak.</p> <p>\u201cBefore, we didn\u2019t do enough prevention control or case management of individual patients. But now, if you take this clinic as just one example, you can see the changes. Where once only senior level staff had proper training, now it has cascaded to all healthcare workers.\u201d</p> <p>Fahncole diagnoses the baby girl with non-life threatening malaria and she is allowed to go home. But as she points out, there is still a long way to go when it comes to improving the health of the nation.<br></p> <p>\u201cMalaria is one the biggest killers of children here. Many families have no roofs on their houses so they have no way to protect themselves from malaria. When it rains they have to sleep in the wet, then they get pneumonia. We still have no way to stop poverty making people sick.\u201d</p>",
  "<p></p> <p>Inequality and gender have rightfully become subjects of study at many schools and institutions in Uganda. But, despite the years that have passed, we have not really succeeded in creating gender equality here or in most other countries across the globe.</p> <p>Due to the way we have grown up, many people still hold the old attitudes: women are the ones supposed to cook, wash, take care of the children, and kneel down when greeting others. While women are in the kitchens cooking, men should go and work to provide for the family. Men give the instructions at home because they are seen as the controllers in the relationship. We teach these ideas to our children without even realising it, as they watch and copy the older generation.</p> <p>During my childhood, I spent most of my time with my mother because my dad had multiple wives. I could see he didn\u2019t help my mum in any domestic work and he would blame her if anything went wrong.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The man\u2019s work still remains going to work, watching TV, playing football and sleeping</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <h2>Is this the way it should be?</h2> <p>A few years ago, gender roles in Uganda started to shift. Women have begun to go out to work and now they contribute the family finances. However, even though there has been this change at work, women still seem to hold all the domestic roles they had from the past. They are still given instructions by men, they are the ones who cook all the meals, they are supposed to take care of their babies, to wash clothes for the children and their husbands, and do all the housework. The man\u2019s work still remains going to work, watching TV, playing football and sleeping. Worst of all, when she gets her salary, the man takes 90% or even 100% control over it in many cases.</p> <p>If you are a married man, have you ever tried to do all the work that your wife does before she goes to work? Have you tried to sit at home with your children, to know how much work your wife\u2019s days are?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"4fafc2c3285261a52f8acc84de54f177d32fab8f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4fafc2c3285261a52f8acc84de54f177d32fab8f/0_205_3240_4050/800.jpg\" alt=\"Sam stirs a large pot\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Women are expected to cook all the meals, take care of the children, clean the house and do the washing.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Woira</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When I speak to women and ask them how it is to be a woman, they tell me: \u201cThat is what I am, I can\u2019t change anything. It is our way. I do what makes my husband happy.\u201d This means that not only do they try to do everything just to make us men happy, but they are not happy themselves.</p> <h2>My inequality challenge</h2> <p>I am a social worker and I know that I have a big responsibility. I know that the street children I work with watch me and learn how to act. I know I have to be a role model for them and for the community. </p> <p>At Salve, we organised an <a href=\"http://www.inequalityquestion.com.\">Inequality Question challenge</a> for the children we work with \u2013 each month they debate a question they choose. I saw this as my opportunity to learn how it feels to be a woman, having many decisions made for you by someone of the opposite gender.  </p> <p>As I am a single guy and I don\u2019t yet have a wife or children, I gave up all of my powers of decision making to six women. They each controlled me for one day. </p> <h2>So what happened?</h2> <p>Every day I was given different instructions from my female controllers. Some of them were easy, such as calling five women who inspire me to tell them why I admire them so much. I chose friends, work colleagues and of course my mother. Other tasks made me feel embarrassed and some even caused friends to laugh and stop talking to me.</p> <p>On the first day, I was told I should clean all the utensils in my house and leave it clean before I go to work. I had planned to wake up at 5:30am but I slept until 6:00am and had to do everything in a rush. I first mopped the house and then cleaned the plates and the cups. When I finished it was already 7:30am. I had 30 minutes to reach work but had not finished bathing and could not leave home without taking a shower. For the first time this year, I reached work 30 minutes late. </p> <p>Because of the pressure of having a lot of work to do at home, it\u2019s easy for women to reach their workplaces late and be told off by their managers. I wish the bosses could understand what they go through before abusing them. </p> <p>After hearing that I was late, some of my friends acknowledged how hard it is to be a woman. One of them promised to help his wife with domestic work so that she can also reach work on time. But some of my friends were just rude. They laughed and said if I was becoming a woman, I should stop working altogether. Some people still believe that women should not work. We have really a long way to go when it comes to teaching people about gender and how men and women need the same opportunities.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>At my workplace, I was instructed to put on a bright blue wig so that I can look beautiful</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>At my workplace, I was instructed to put on a bright blue wig so that I can look beautiful, exactly how African women are expected to wear wigs or weaves by the community. Of course, everyone\u2019s focus was now on me and my wig. The children I work with were all commenting on it, saying I am like a woman, too focused on my looks rather than work. They started calling me aunt instead of uncle. They said I should change my voice to be high pitched and they wouldn\u2019t listen to me when I gave them instructions. They started to not respect me. I couldn\u2019t focus well on my work. It showed me that the children on the streets hadn\u2019t learned a lot of gender respect in their lives so far. </p> <p>Another day, I was told to greet all of the women by kneeling to them as a sign of respect, in the same way that children and women are expected to kneel to elders here in Uganda. It had been so long since I last had to do this (when I was a young boy). But women have to keep doing it \u2013 it is like we are saying a woman doesn\u2019t grow up but remains a girl. In doing this, I noticed how much the women themselves appreciated it. They liked me showing them extra respect and trying to put myself in their shoes. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4ed789eeb1ed614e140b1485d275b31ae8d47b3f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4ed789eeb1ed614e140b1485d275b31ae8d47b3f/61_21_885_653/500.jpg\" alt=\"Sam kneels to a female colleague, wearing his blue wig\" width=\"500\" height=\"369\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kneeling is seen as a sign of respect, but only children and women are expected to do it.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Woira</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I was also instructed to get oranges and put them on my chest to see how awkward breasts make life. That was a bit hard. I couldn\u2019t walk at a fast rate. I am sure my manager didn\u2019t like my laziness that day. And the way I was treated was rude. Men called me silly names like \u201cDem\u201d which they usually call cute girls. You don\u2019t know how insulting it can be if you\u2019re called funny names just because you\u2019re a woman. It is really awkward and makes you feel ashamed.</p> <p>Women in Africa always sit down on the floor while eating food. And that is one of the instructions that one of my female controllers gave me. I had started getting used to behaving in a way that got attention so this was easy. I was growing harder skin. But still my male workmates thought I was mad. They did not think they could do something like that. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/apr/03/my-careers-biggest-lesson-no-women-no-development\">My career\u2019s biggest lesson:  no women, no development</a> </p> </aside>  <p>You may not call these serious challenges, but some of my friends changed their attitude about me. When I told them I was doing an inequality challenge, they thought I was stupid. I have a friend who stopped talking to me. I began to ask him questions that challenged his thinking. I asked whether he had ever taken any good ideas from a woman \u2013 whether he had any lecturers at university that were women, whether his mother is important in his life. He said yes and eventually accepted that women are also important.</p> <p>Most of the women really liked the idea. Most of the ladies that asked me about why I was doing this were happy. They saw me as someone who will show other men that it is just physical make up that makes us different, but they can do all of the things that men can do. They liked that we could challenge inequality together. </p> <h2>What should the permanent solution be?</h2> <p>Men need to wake up to the opportunities that equality could bring. Why don\u2019t we stand by our sisters, mothers, wives and daughters? That is how we can build a great Uganda. We have female MPs, lawyers, doctors and teachers \u2013 we need to show them respect and appreciate their value in our society. I identify as a feminist and I want to inspire every man and woman to join me in this identity.</p> <p>Try it one day, be treated like a Ugandan woman. I promise you will be surprised and extremely tired. But if you decide to change and to work together, then both of you can be at your best for the day ahead. Give it a try \u2013 we need to create a good example for our children to learn from. </p> <p></p> <p>Words without action mean nothing. This is my call for action. Let\u2019s fight inequality. It is only our action that can take it away.</p> <p><a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/global-development\"><strong>Join our community</strong></a><strong> of development professionals and humanitarians.

A police banner was quickly dangled over a sign that read \u201cFree Territory of Democracy\u201d, a table was pulled up, chairs shoved behind it, the reporters wedged into every available space including windows, up a staircase and seated on the floor until it looked less like a press conference and more like a sit-in.

The BoE relaxed monetary policy in an effort to support the economy following the vote to leave the EU by discouraging banks from hoarding cash.</p> <p>RBS\u2019s chairman, Sir Howard Davies, said that as interest rates get closer to zero the central bank loses control of the effects of monetary policy and leaves itself few options for action iin a recession.</p> <p>Davies told Bloomberg TV: \u201cWhen you reach the lower band you don\u2019t know how the economy will respond \u2026 We don\u2019t really know what impact QE on the scale it is being implemented is having. I really do think we are entering a period where some of the previous certainties are no longer quite so certain and you really need to rethink the monetary policy framework.\u201d</p> <p>Davies said he agreed with John Williams, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, who said last week central banks should consider adopting a higher inflation target more suited to lower growth.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m in favour of trying to lift over time the level of inflation we target,\u201d Davies said. The BoE aims to keep inflation rising at a rate of 2%, a target it is likely to exceed as the falling pound pushes up prices even as the economy slows. </p> <p>Global interest rates are very low and are negative in the eurozone and other jurisdictions as central banks seek to discourage companies and banks from hoarding cash by charging banks to park money with the central bank.

From there it became more a story, why ramen in particular.\u201d</p> <p>Gibson-Light interviewed close to 60 inmates over the course of a year at one state prison as part of a wider study on prison labor. He did not identify the prison to protect the confidentiality of the inmates. </p> <p>He found that the instant soup has surpassed tobacco as the most prized currency at the prison. He also analyzed other nationwide investigations that he says found a trend towards using ramen noodles in exchanges. </p> <p>\u201cOne way or another, everything in prison is about money,\u201d one soft-spoken prisoner named Rogers said in the report. \u201cSoup is money in here.

Gustavo \u201cGoose\u201d Alvarez, who spent more than a decade incarcerated on a weapons charge, wrote a book on its popularity, Prison Ramen: Recipes and Stories From Behind Bars.</p> <p>He was inspired to write the book after a race riot in 2009 led to a standoff between a group of Hispanic and African American inmates. An older inmate quelled the dispute and the two groups resolved the tensions by cooking a feast together, largely with ramen noodles. </p> <p>The book, released last year, includes several recipes such as Ramen Tamale, using Doritos, canned pork and beans, and ramen.

Gibson-Light found that black-market food became more valuable after control over food preparation switched from one private firm to another in the early 2000s. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/18/us-government-private-prisons-use-justice-department\">US justice department announces it will end use of private prisons</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThat change was part of a cost-cutting measure,\u201d Gibson-Light said. \u201cWith that change that resulted in a reduction in the quantity of the food the inmates were receiving.\u201d</p> <p>Inmates at the prison Gibson-Light studied went from receiving three hot meals a day to two hot meals and one cold lunch during the week, and only two meals for the whole day on the weekend. </p> <p>The phenomenon is described by Gibson-Light as \u201cpunitive frugality\u201d. Spending on corrections has not kept pace with the number of inmates in prisons since 1982, the report found. </p> <p>Prisoners said that they did not have enough calories to see them through the day, so ramen provides an additional hit. </p> <p>\u201cI save all my meals to eat at once so I can actually get full,\u201d a prisoner named \u201cDS\u201d said. </p> <p>The little food that is available is usually of extremely poor quality. Correctional officers warned Gibson-Light not to eat it, as it might result in food poisoning. One corrections officer recalled that he once examined the food in the kitchen and found a box that contained \u201cnasty looking full chickens\u201d that was boldly marked several times with the words \u201cnot for human consumption\u201d.</p> <p>The lack of food and the poor quality have contributed to ramen\u2019s popularity. Gibson-Light found that even at prisons where tobacco has been banned or other items were more popular to trade\u2013 such as stamps and envelopes \u2013 there has been a shift towards food<strong tabindex=\"-1\">. </strong></p> <p>At the prison from the study, ramen cost 59 cents at the commissary but would be exchanged for items worth more in value. For instance, a sweatshirt \u2013 worth $10.81 \u2013 can be bought for two packs of ramen. Five tailor-made cigarettes \u2013 worth $2.00 \u2013 can be bought for one pack of ramen. Acquiring fresh vegetables to cook with was extremely highly regarded, Gibson-Light said. Inmates would use ramen to buy onions or zucchinis stolen from the kitchen.</p> <p>Others cleaned inmates\u2019 bunks for one pack of ramen \u2013 referred to as soup \u2013 a week, or did laundry or gambled with it. </p> <p>It can get dangerous when ramen is purchased at illegal inmate stores, as customers often purchase items on credit. Failure to pay back debts can result in fights or worse. </p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen fights over ramen,\u201d one inmate said. \u201cPeople get killed over soup.\u201d</p> <p>Gibson-Light explained that forms of currencies only change in extreme circumstances. </p> <p>\u201c[Money] doesn\u2019t change unless there\u2019s some drastic change to the value in people using it,\u201d he said. The shift from tobacco to ramen highlights how dire the nutritional standards at prisons has become, he added.</p>",

This case is a clear reflection of what we\u2019re trying to change with the new system, but these cases are still happening,\u201d Aguilar said.</p> <p>Under the new legislation, prisoners like Morales who were remanded under the old system are entitled to have their preventive imprisonment reviewed. <br></p> <p>But the judge has so far refused, according to Morales\u2019s lawyer, Rodolfo Moreno. \u201cThe judge is being very rigid and has rejected every appeal and effort to resolve this absurd case \u2013 something I see time and time again with indigenous defendants,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Since international human rights standards were incorporated into the Mexico constitution in 2011, judges are supposed to remand suspects only in the most serious circumstances, such as when there is a risk of flight or violence.</p> <p>\u201cYou have to also take a step back from the judge and wonder why, when we have such big problems with organised crime and other important cases, that the public prosecutors think it\u2019s worth putting resources into a case like this,\u201d said Aguilar.</p> <p>The alleged crime was committed in 2012, when Morales \u2013 a car mechanic and member of the local council \u2013 was clearing a plot of land where he grows maize and beans. </p> <p>Court documents show that another family member admitted shooting the rabbits to police and paid a cash bond at the court, pending trial. But the case did not proceed, and was forgotten by the family.</p> <p>More than three years later, Morales was arrested in the municipal government offices where he was serving as the public security councillor. </p> <p>His relative\u2019s admission of guilt was rejected by the judge, who is also demanding that Morales prove his ethnicity by appointing an anthropologist as an expert witness. </p> <p>\u201cEven if he had killed the rabbits, this is completely disproportionate. It could take another year to meet the judge\u2019s demands, which is expensive and will cause even more damage to the whole family,\u201d said Moreno.</p> <p>Morales\u2019s 22-year-old son, also called Heliodoro, is studying law, but he finds the case against his father incomprehensible. </p> <p>\u201cMy dad has worked hard his whole life to give us opportunities he never had.

In 1961, he founded the journal Souffles (Breaths), a nexus for radical poets and artists. The journal was eventually shut down by the authorities.<em> </em>La\u00e2bi<strong> </strong>was arrested, tortured and sentenced to 10 years imprisonment. He served eight-and-a-half years, from 1972 to 1980. He has lived in France since 1985. </p> <p> Beyond the Barbed Wire begins with examples of the distinctly modernist early work from the mid-70s. A less florid, more direct and simple manner marks the poems written during his incarceration, the style in which he continues to write. My Mother\u2019s Language is characteristic, an autobiographical post-prison poem in plain free verse that takes everyday language on trust, and rejects the use of a persona. A trace of the more experimental poet survives with respect to punctuation. No punctuation marks are used: the invisible presence of a full-stop seems to be indicated when the ensuing word is given an upper-case opening letter.</p> <p> The poet\u2019s mother, like her language, remains nameless, but we meet and hear her in the poem. In the book\u2019s concluding interview, the poet tells <a href=\"http://www.christopherschaefer.com/biography/\">Christopher Schaefer</a> a little about both his parents. Illiterate like his craftsman father, his mother, who had 11 children, eight of whom survived, possessed \u201ca rich language, full of images, and a great sense of humour. She was often angry at her condition, and it was by listening to her speak that perhaps \u2013 and I say perhaps \u2013 the desire to write was born in me.\u201d According to legend, the family was exiled from Spain, and La\u00e2bi describes his mother as white-skinned and blue-eyed. The reference to the rosary in the 19th line, \u201cthe unfindable rosary of her nicknames\u201d, may just possibly allude to some distant, cultural intermingling with Catholicism.</p> <p> The poem begins with the son\u2019s loss: it moves swiftly, almost harshly, to the mother\u2019s despair and apparent suicide, and then, in vivid detail, evokes her fury: \u201cThey say that each morning / she would pull her headscarf off / and strike the floor seven times / cursing the heavens and the Tyrant.\u201d One imagines the headscarf itself being used as an angry whip \u2013 a powerful image. The \u201cTyrant\u201d is presumably <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hassan_II_of_Morocco\">Hassan II</a>, who ruled from 1961 to 1999, the period of \u201cthe lead(en) years\u201d. </p> <p> The image of <a href=\"http://irisnews.net/abdellatif-laabi-sous-le-baillon-le-poeme-sotto-il-bavaglio-la-poesia/\">the prison cell as a cave</a> recalls Plato\u2019s cave as well as those prehistoric caves whose wallpainting survives. It\u2019s suggested that the darkness of tyranny and suffering might be instructive, a means of education. The \u201cbestiary of the future\u201d may not, initially, seem an optimistic image, but the cave paintings possibly depicted hunting scenes \u2013 representing, therefore, food and hope. The prisoners\u2019 bestiary is not necessarily a perpetuation of brutality. </p> <p> The reprise of the first line marks a shift of mood to the tender tragicomic memory of the (presumably once-treasured) china coffee cups. Sentimental attachment to inherited possessions is tactfully rejected: the ugly cups get broken without regret. The mother\u2019s legacy to her son is something more radical. In a striking image she\u2019s felt to be \u201cusing\u201d the son\u2019s mouth. She becomes rawly audible with \u201cher profanities, curses and gibberish\u201d \u2013 the idiomatic earth of poetry. </p> <p> \u201cLanguage\u201d in this poem is surely used in the broadest sense. It\u2019s not relevant, here, whether the mother speaks the Moroccan Arabic dialect, or French, or <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berber_languages\">Amazigh</a>, or any other tongue. It\u2019s the \u201chow\u201d and not the \u201cwhat\u201d, the way she makes whichever language she uses her own and her children\u2019s, the personal and family idiolect and all its homely, inimitable context and connotation. Those coffee cups begin to gain a relevant metaphorical dimension. The coffee-loving poet doesn\u2019t regret the broken cups. Coffee matters more than the cups in which it\u2019s served, as speech amounts to more than an exquisite shell of signifiers.</p> <p> The third reprise of the first line is nicely harmonised by the translator with a final qualifying couplet: notice the carefully judged, differently grammatical, repetition of \u201clast\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s been twenty years since I last saw my mother / but I am the last man / who still speaks her language.\u201d It\u2019s as if we\u2019re caught with the speaker in the middle of time and the onward sweep of annihilation.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/mar/28/poem-of-the-week-skins-by-patience-agbabi\">Poem of the week: Skins by Patience Agbabi</a> </p> </aside>  <p> My Mother\u2019s Language, as always in La\u00e2bi\u2019s mature work, captures political resonance at the level of human intimacy.

They were funded and inspected by the Home Office but run by voluntary organisations. </p> <p>Following the Children and Young Persons Act 1969, they were replaced by community homes, which were run by local councils.</p> <p>National Archives files include correspondence between three doctors \u2013 all of whom have since died \u2013 discussing plans for the drug trials. </p> <p>In a letter from 1967, Dr JR Hawkins, a psychiatrist working at Richmond Hill, wrote to the Home Office asking permission to test the drugs on boys who were \u201cimpulsive, explosive, irritable, restless and aggressive\u201d.</p> <p>Hawkings said this would be \u201ca perfectly normal and legitimate therapy for certain types of disturbed adolescent\u201d and that the drugs had not yet been widely tested on such boys.</p> <p>According to a letter dated November 1967, Home Office psychiatrist Dr Pamela Mason welcomed Hawkings\u2019s plan. \u201cFrom the clinical or practical point of view these are the boys that can produce considerable problems within a school and this sort of research into possible drug treatment is to be welcomed,\u201d she said. \u201cI would recommend maximum support for this project.\u201d</p> <p>In November 1968, Dr Joyce Galbraith, a psychiatrist working at Springhead Park, also wrote to Mason saying she was increasingly concerned about unrest at the school.</p> <p>She suggested giving Haloperidol to every girl in the school for 18 weeks. \u201cMy suggestion is that we should try some form of drug trial to see if, by allaying the anxiety of the girls chemically, we might perhaps settle the school a little bit more, and give the staff an opportunity to put their own house in order,\u201d she wrote.</p>",

  "<p>Reporters working for western news outlets in the Middle East are routinely accused by Isis, among others, of being spies. Their claims to being impartial observers are scorned.</p> <p>Given the situation, it is surely crucial for front-line journalists to do all they can to illustrate their neutrality. </p> <p>So I\u2019m not sure it was wise for the Mail on Sunday to publish a picture of its correspondent in Iraq, Mark Nicol, posing with a rifle taken from a dead Isis fighter.</p> <p>In his article, <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3751054/Terror-Tigris-gripping-dispatch-reporter-captured-jihadi-rifle-hands-s-shelled-Kurdish-Black-Tigers.html\">Terror on the Tigris</a>, Nicol explained how it came about. Along with photographer John McLellan he was accompanying Kurdish Peshmerga forces who are attempting to dislodge Isis from the Iraqi city of Mosul.</p> <p>In so doing, they came under heavy bombardment and Nicol described how they were forced to dive for cover. I will not be alone in applauding their bravery. But what happened next is more questionable:</p> <blockquote> <p>\u201cInvited by the Peshmerga to pose with an AKM assault rifle taken just hours earlier from a dead IS fighter, I reluctantly oblige in front of Qwer bridge. I am distracted by the thought of how many lives it may have taken, but the Kurds hold up their camera phones and snap away.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>And, of course, McLellan snapped away too. His pictures were then - unwisely in my view - transmitted to the newspaper in London.</p> <p>I somehow doubt that Nicol or McLellan asked for, or knew, that the image would end up on page 45 of yesterday\u2019s Mail on Sunday and, of course, on Mail Online (where it could be seen by Isis). </p> <p>The pair must have known the photograph would increase their chances of being Isis targets and, just as significantly, that it would have the effect of increasing the danger for their journalistic colleagues.</p> <p>Editors should have realised the risks too and should not have run it. A picture of a gun-toting journalist, no matter how uncomfortable he looked, no matter that he was \u201cpersuaded\u201d to do it, is the last thing that should appear.</p> <p>Vaughan Smith, founder of London\u2019s Frontline Club, which includes many foreign correspondents among its membership, said: \u201cThis is awful.\u201d </p> <p>He thought it would imperil frontline journalists, arguing that it was \u201cindulgent and dangerous dilettantism\u201d that invited armed groups \u201cto treat us as participants in conflict, making us more vulnerable while decreasing our value as observers.\u201d</p> <p>He said: \u201cIt fecklessly undermines the work of many industry institutions over the years to promote journalists as neutral observers.\u201d</p> <p>Steven M Ellis, director of advocacy and communications with the International Press Institute (IPI), thought it \u201cextremely irresponsible to do anything that might blur the line between journalist and combatant.\u201d</p> <p>He said: \u201cIt unnecessarily puts journalists, and their colleagues, in greater danger. As there always may be a camera around, we strongly advise against posing with firearms in conflict zones.\u201d</p> <p>There was strong criticism from journalists working in the Middle East, such as freelancer Peter Schwartstein. He <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PSchwartzstein/status/767601966239408129\">addressed Nicol directly on Twitter</a>: \u201cJournos in MENA frequently get accused of being spies. Prats like you posing w guns provide fodder.\u201d<br></p> <p>Sky News\u2019s Tom Rayner <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RaynerSkyNews/status/767614354464223232\">was also critical:</a> \u201cJournalists in conflict zones face enough danger without this kind of idiocy\u201d. And <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bencnn/status/767614679959146496\">CNN\u2019s Bed Wedeman</a>, wrote: \u201cIt\u2019s the last thing we need in an already perilous environment.\u201d</p> <p>In <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MarkNicolMoS/status/767628248566132736\">a Twitter response to Rayner and Wedeman</a>, Nicol appeared to apologise: \u201cI think on reflection you\u2019re right and I\u2019m wrong. Sometimes it is easy to make misjudgements.\u201d (However, that had not stopped him from using the picture, albeit briefly, as his Twitter profile image).</p> <p>But the real culprits were at the paper\u2019s headquarters. Given that the Mail on Sunday\u2019s editor, Geordie Greig, was on holiday, it meant that his deputy, Gerard Greaves (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/apr/20/daily-mail-paul-dacre-jon-steafel-gerard-greaves\">soon to join the Daily Mail</a>), was in overall charge. </p> <p>The Mail on Sunday declined to comment. But executives clearly took the matter seriously and, after some discussion, later removed the picture from the online report.<br></p>",

Unlike South Korea, we are already a highly diverse nation \u2013 with non-white populations as high as 40% in some cities \u2013 and that\u2019s not going to change, no matter how hard we cling to our union jacks. The challenge for Britain is how to strike out alone and remain outward-facing.</p> <p>So next time the leave-remain debate rears its head around your kitchen table, maybe the South Korean example is a decent rebuttal to the doom-mongers?</p>",
  "<h2>Best individual US performance</h2> <p>When Katie Ledecky touched the wall to complete the first 200-400-800 treble in 48 years, an entire 11.38 seconds would pass \u2013 longer than it took Usain Bolt to win the 100m final \u2013 before Britain\u2019s Jazz Carlin came in for the silver. The world\u2019s most dominant swimmer is now a perfect 16 for 16 in individual events in international competitions and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/13/katie-ledecky-swimming-2016-dominant-athlete\">has effectively supplanted Michael Phelps</a> as the face of the sport.<strong> BG</strong><br></p> <p>In an Olympics in which Michael Phelps went out on top and Simone Biles brought everybody to their feet, it was another American who was the Games\u2019 top performer. Katie Ledecky, just 19, won the 200m, 400m and 800m freestyle with ease. In the 400m and 800m she had already made her final turn when the rest of the swimmers were still swimming the other way. She won another gold in the 4x200m relay, and only a silver in the 4x100m kept her from a perfect five golds. <strong>LC</strong></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/13/katie-ledecky-swimming-2016-dominant-athlete\">For the remarkable Katie Ledecky, the future appears limitless | Bryan Armen Graham</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There were so many, but it\u2019s hard to look past what Michael Phelps did.

After Phelps, the individual performance runner-up is Ryan Lochte. Just saying \u201cwhatever\u201d when a gun was (fake) held to his head? What courage. <strong>DG</strong></p> <p>Simone Biles. I get the Ledecky arguments, and clearly so, but to me, Biles wins it. Her Olympic legacy \u2013 aside from the five medals \u2013 suggests that we will never see another gymnast like her ever again.

They won their sixth straight Olympic gold this weekend and have now won 49 straight games. Almost none of them have been close. They don\u2019t get enough attention for what they have done. <strong>LC</strong></p> <p>The women\u2019s gymnastics team made it back-to-back team gold medals in Rio even though reigning Olympic all-around champion Gabby Douglas was off her game. That\u2019s dominant. And the people who criticized Douglas for not putting her hand over her heart? That\u2019s pathetic. <strong>DG</strong></p> <p>Women\u2019s gymnastics team all-around. The Final Five didn\u2019t just deliver, they destroyed the opposition. As my colleague Bryan Armen Graham pointed out: \u201cFour years ago, USA won by 5.066 points, the biggest margin in 52 years. This time they won by 8.209.\u201d The victory was remarkable, the way in which they won it \u2013 with poise and maturity \u2013 even more so. <strong>LME</strong></p> <p>This year\u2019s US women\u2019s basketball team might end up being remembered as one of the greatest collections of talent the sport has ever seen. They made the insanely stacked but occasionally rudderless men\u2019s team look like amateurs in comparison.

Did he embarrass the American team? Hell Jeah. <strong>DG</strong></p> <p>Ryan Lochte? Kidding. To me, it\u2019s Missy Franklin. Back in London she was the teenage darling of the US swim team winning five medals as a 17-year-old. In Rio, she failed to live up to her own expectations by failing to qualify for the 200m freestyle and the 200m back finals with her only gold being in the 200m freestyle relay, only because she swam in prelims. Didn\u2019t even get on the podium. <strong>LME</strong></p> <p><br>The biggest disappointment I had was not with any athletes but with that segment of \u201cfans\u201d who spent the Olympics hounding Gabby Douglas for entirely fabricated reasons. The Olympics are supposed to bring out the best in us, not the worst. <strong>HF</strong></p> <h2>Star of the Olympics</h2> <p>Simone Biles had been preordained as individual all-around champion from the beginning of last year, casting one of the Olympics\u2019 prestige competitions as essentially a race for the silver. That she would come home with a fistful of golds, barring injury or an unimaginable meltdown, was the working presumption. But then Biles had to, you know, <em>go out and do it</em>. Her performance under that pressure is hard to fathom. Clearly it made an impact on her team-mates, who voted the smallest member of the 554-person delegation to be the flag-bearer at Sunday night\u2019s closing ceremony. <strong>BG</strong></p> <p>Usain Bolt has now overwhelmed his opponents in the 100m and 200m for three Olympics now. And while he will never win as big as he did in 2008 he still wins comfortably enough that he can still turn his head and laugh. No athlete, not anyone in the NBA or any of the swimmers or gymnasts, draws a crowd or creates a buzz like Bolt. When he is running it remains THE show of the Games. <strong>LC</strong></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2016/aug/20/usain-bolt-triple-treble-greatness-rio-olympics\">Usain Bolt\u2019s unrepeatable Threepeat proves his true greatness at razor\u2019s edge | Barney Ronay</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Rio.

But the Rio Games went as well as any other. Whoops. <strong>DG</strong></p> <p>I mean, come on. Isn\u2019t it obvious? The Olympics are built for one man and one man only: Usain Bolt. Three gold medals in three consecutive Games is jaw-dropping. When he runs, the Jamaican sprinter knows that the only person who stands in his way is himself. Anyone else is merely a spectator, ready to marvel at poetry in fast motion. <strong>LME</strong></p> <p>Globally? Probably Usain Bolt. US-specific? Simone Biles.

It all began with a thoughtless tweet, ridiculing a nation with Zika jibes. Then, it got much, much worse as booing and crowd-jeering became the norm every time she took a goal-kick during the tournament. Her Rio experience ended in a tasteless way as the greatest goalie the US has ever produced called Sweden \u2013 who beat them in the quarter-finals \u2013 a bunch of cowards. Stay classy, Hope. <strong>LME</strong></p> <p>Thanks to his rapidly disintegrating \u201crobbery story,\u201d I\u2019m going to go with Ryan Lochte for managing to use these Olympics as an opportunity to present himself as the Platonic Ideal of the 21st century Ugly American, trumping up half-baked lies based on lazy stereotypes to cover up his own jackassery. <strong>HF</strong></p> <h2>Is Phelps a better athlete than Bolt?</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f5108912c6c74719629df230bb641509a0649175\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f5108912c6c74719629df230bb641509a0649175/0_0_2514_1801/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Usain Bolt brought joy and talent to the Games once again\" width=\"1000\" height=\"716\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Usain Bolt brought joy and talent to the Games once again.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mike Egerton/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Hard to say. Phelps\u2019 otherworldly longevity \u2013 it\u2019s stunning to think he won his first medal when Creed was the biggest band in America \u2013 tips the scales in his favor. But when you consider the wider competition pool of a sport with virtually no barriers to entry, Bolt\u2019s ability to bring his very best when the lights are brightest stands alone. Consider that he\u2019s started in 21 finals in the 100m, 200m and 4x100m relay over the last eight years and won 20 of them \u2013 a false start in Daegu representing the lone blemish. Heady stuff. <strong>BG</strong></p> <p>Wow, this is a tough one, they are specialists at such different things. I\u2019m tempted to say Bolt because I bet he\u2019s a great swimmer but Phelps might be a fast runner too. We should have a separate Olympics for just the two of them, like the old Superstars on ABC. <strong>LC</strong></p> <p>Michael Phelps is the greatest swimmer of all-time and it\u2019s not even close. But running is a universal human activity. Every child in every country learns to stand and then walk and then they try to run. It\u2019s natural. Swimming is learned, but every person on earth with a set of functioning legs has run. And Usain Bolt is the fastest runner in recorded human history. Bolt beats Phelps. <strong>DG</strong></p> <p>Longevity against supremacy. Phelps \u2013 akin to a shark hunting for prey \u2013 has 23 gold medals. That\u2019s almost twice as much as any other Olympian. Bolt on the other hand is untouchable, holding the best ever records for 100, 200 and 4x100 meters. This is tough, but I\u2019m going with Phelps simply because he not only wins, he can do it in more than one race in the space of an hour. Not sure if Bolt could replicate. <strong>LME</strong></p> <p>This is a tricky, perhaps even unfair question. It\u2019s pretty much impossible to compare the two, who have both established themselves as the elite of the elite. Still, it feels like Bolt transcends his sport in a way that Phelps doesn\u2019t. Bolt looks like he\u2019s on a different plane of existence from those he competes against. <strong>HF</strong></p> <h2>The US\u2019s performance at the Olympics was ... </h2> <p>As good as it gets. You know things are going OK when the Star-Spangled Banner supplants Mike Posner\u2019s I Took A Pill In Ibiza as the most overplayed song of the summer. Team USA finished on 121 medals. That total includes 61 won by American women, who would have finished fourth on the medal table if they comprised their own country. Yes, it\u2019s to be expected from such an affluent nation, but impressive all the same. <strong>BG</strong> </p> <p>Simply dominating. One afternoon I took a stroll near my apartment in Copacabana and heard the US national anthem coming from televisions in neighborhood bars three times as the US got golds in different events. <strong>LC</strong></p> <p>Dominant. The most gold, the most silver and the most bronze. The US finished with 50% more medals than runner-up China. When Donald Trump gets to work on making America great again, he can steer clear of the US Olympic program. They\u2019re doing just fine. <strong>DG</strong></p> <p>The best there ever was. Team USA passed the 100-medal mark on 18 August. But what\u2019s more impressive is the level of diversity across the squad. From humble, yet honorable boxer Nico Hernandez to the inspiring Ibtihaj Muhammad, this was a tournament where the colors of America truly shone. <strong>LME</strong><br></p> <p>About what was to be expected? It feels like we\u2019re a bit spoiled here in America in the fact that no matter how many medals we come up with it there\u2019s only two possible results \u201cwe did what we expected to do\u201d or \u201cwe completely failed and should be embarrassed with ourselves.\u201d <strong>HF</strong></p> <h2>One event that shouldn\u2019t be in the Olympics</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"19ad13d5421c221590d4d71a0e7753f15c8f3fba\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/19ad13d5421c221590d4d71a0e7753f15c8f3fba/0_26_4724_2836/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sorry dressage, your time in the sun is over.

Olympic competitions should in theory represent the biggest international event in that sport, a standard doubly true for new additions to an already bloated programme. But that clearly wasn\u2019t the case based on the small army of top-ranked golfers who played the Zika card for a guilt-free out. <strong>BG</strong></p> <p>Boxing. I\u2019ve always loved Olympic boxing, think of all the great stars who first introduced themselves to the world from the Games. But the latest AIBA scandals have shown there is now way to properly manage the tournament. Adding pro fighters will not make it better. <strong>LC</strong></p> <p>Dressage. Ballroom dancing has struggled to even get consideration as an Olympic exhibition sport, yet we\u2019re giving out medals for horse dancing? Sad! A common sense rule for approving Olympic sports is that humans should be allowed to compete in it before other animals are. We don\u2019t have thoroughbred racing in the Olympics over the 100m do we? No. Dump dressage. <strong>DG</strong></p> <p>Golf. After a 112-year hiatus, the sport returned to Rio and it was overwhelmingly anti-climatic. It really felt like a side event rather than a triumphant spectacle that returned after a century of hibernation. <strong>LME</strong></p> <p>Dressage. Nothing involving horses should count as a sport, let alone an Olympic sport. In fact, in order for something to count as a sport, all participants must actually be aware that they are, in fact, participating in one. <strong>HF</strong></p> <h2>One event that should be in the Olympics</h2> <p>Squash, the healthiest sport in the world, is played competitively on six continents. The men\u2019s and women\u2019s games are equally popular. Touring pros would be hugely supportive as the Olympics would represent the pinnacle of their career. It\u2019s cheap to set up courts and possible to do it in spectacular settings: like the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHTjbVMBetk\">pyramids of Giza</a> or <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86-RWmD1AI4\">Grand Central Station</a>. <strong>BG</strong> </p> <p>Tug of war. This was an event in early Olympics and from the photos I\u2019ve seen it looks like tremendous fun. It would do great on television. Who doesn\u2019t want to watch a great tug of war? <strong>LC</strong></p> <p>Backwards running. The backstroke is one of four strokes competed in swimming events. But when it comes to running events, straight-forward is the only way in the Olympics. Maybe it\u2019s just that the IOC doesn\u2019t want to give more medals to the US. No doubt American defensive backs would sweep the backwards running events. <strong>DG</strong></p> <p>Beach soccer or Futsal. Imagine how good it would have been to have beach futbol in Rio. The crowds would have gone insane and the atmosphere \u2013 as it was closer to the action \u2013 electric. There are also some truly talented futsal players (Falcao, Ricardinho, Amandinha) that deserve the Olympic spotlight. <strong>LME</strong></p> <p>I was all set to make a case for baseball and softball making a return to the Olympics and then I did a search and discovered that the IOC voted to bring back both of them for the Olympic games in 2020. It\u2019s still depressing that there has been an entire generation of softball players who never even had the chance to dream about the Olympics. <strong> HF</strong></p>",

A favourite technique, <a href=\"http://australianmuseum.net.au/common-wombat\">according to the Australian Museum</a>, is to flee to a nearby burrow and then use their sizeable rump to crush the pursuing predator\u2019s head against the dirt roof. </p> <p>Their bites are usually not severe but can cause a serious infection if untreated. </p> <p>Martin Lind, from the ACT\u2019s wildlife service, said the animals were deceptively fast \u201clittle bulldozers\u201d and not as cute and cuddly as commonly portrayed.</p> <p>\u201cAs babies, they\u2019re clingy, they\u2019re adorable, they\u2019re with mum 24 hours a day, they\u2019re in a soft, snuggly sleeping bag all the time listening to a heart beat,\u201d Lind <a href=\"http://www.canberratimes.com.au/act-news/are-wombats-really-that-dangerous-yes-says-an-expert-20160819-gqwm0h.html\">told The Canberra Times.</a></p> <p>\u201cWhen they start to mature and hit puberty, they just hate everybody and everything. They go from running between your legs and cute as a button to being absolute little \u2013 can I swear? \u2013 little shits. They nip you, they wreck, they bite. I won\u2019t look after wombats because you kiss goodbye to your flooring and everything. They just destroy everything.\u201d</p> <p>Lind suggested wild wombats be given a wide berth.</p>",
  "<p>Kitty Chiller has done and said many strange things in the last four months, some heavily scrutinised and some not, but she\u2019s left one of her most confusing statements of Australia\u2019s Rio Olympic campaign until last. </p> <p>Speaking of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/22/australias-rio-nine-free-to-go-after-fine-paid-by-local-tv-producer\">accreditation activity</a> that ended with a group of Australian athletes being detained by Rio police, <a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/sport/olympics/rio-2016/rio-2016-aussie-rio-nine-still-without-passports-risk-missing-flights-home-20160821-gqxtej.html\">Chiller\u2019s</a> initial reaction was: \u201cI became aware of it a few days earlier and I put a stop to it.

The AOC love a slogan and over the course of these Games they could have settled on the perfect one: Over-promise, under-deliver, shift the blame.</p> <p>Still, Chiller can\u2019t complain about being the public fall guy. She made a rod for her own back with the relentless carry-on before and during the Olympics. Her ongoing public feuds with Nick Kyrgios, Bernard Tomic, the city of Rio, shonky tradesmen, Brazilian crime rates, the Zika virus and myriad other personal grumbles marked her as the Australian most likely to start a news-making argument in an empty room.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Chiller\u2019s greatest skill was how expertly she gained support from a compliant Australian media</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>And by the time these Games kicked off Chiller was quantifiably more famous than the Australian swimmers whose failures we\u2019re now supposed to care about; far more frequently Googled than any and all of Cameron McEvoy, Emily Seebohm, Mack Horton, and Kyle Chalmers among Australian medal hopes. Until Saturday, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/20/australian-chloe-esposito-clinches-gold-in-modern-pentathlon\">when Chloe Esposito claimed a surprise gold</a>, Chiller was also the most famous modern pentathlete in the country. You could argue she still is.</p> <p>Yet the level of \u201cblame\u201d Chiller should wear for Australia\u2019s disappointing campaign depends on how much, if anything at all, you think one person in a ceremonial position like hers can can actually control, and also how much responsibility for their personal and competitive failings these grown adult, professional athletes can abdicate. This is without mentioning the arrogance of believing that Australian athletes have some divine right to medals when they\u2019re competing against densely populated and lavishly funded rival nations. If anything she went above and beyond.</p> <p>Chiller\u2019s greatest skill, in hindsight, is how expertly she gained support from a compliant Australian media; her pre-Games campaign to oust Kyrgios and Tomic (who both stood at least a puncher\u2019s chance of taking medals) was a masterstroke in gaining almost unqualified support from a host of prominent and influential sports columnists and shock jocks, for whom the tennis stars have been frequent and profitable punching bags; bemoaning the act of Australian swimmers <a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/sport/olympics/rio-2016/olympics-australia/what-went-wrong-for-australia-at-the-rio-olympics-it-started-on-the-top-floor-20160818-gqw5fl.html\">removing posters of Herb Elliott and Cathy Freeman</a> in favour of their own also plays to the not-in-my-day leanings of the old guard.</p> <p>For Chiller\u2019s critics, it\u2019s hard to pinpoint exactly how far she\u2019s overreached or underperformed in the course of these Games, because for the best part of 30 years beforehand the chef de mission position was filled by current AOC president John Coates, whose multi-tasking tendencies for so long blurred the lines between his numerous job titles.

Once established as a \u201cpolarising\u201d figure who wound up readers, she became ripe for the stat-boosting search engine optimisation bonanzas on which news websites thrive, a point made here with no absence of irony (Chiller appeared in at least eight Guardian stories in the months before Rio). In fact, having both achieved infamy so effortlessly, Chiller and Kyrgios were actually a match made in heaven. </p> <p>In the lead-up to the Games both the <a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/sport/olympics/rio-2016/that-threw-me-over-the-edge-sledge-from-kyrgios-that-hurt-chiller-the-most-20160714-gq69dg.html\">Sydney Morning Herald</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theaustralian.com.au/sport/rio-olympics/kitty-chiller-profile-what-drives-the-australian-olympic-chef-de-mission/news-story/c9022cae44ba398a5abc795fdafa49ac\">The Australian</a> ran lengthy profile pieces on Chiller that bordered on encomiums.

In actual fact, the harshest critiques of her leadership lay outside the press box.</p> <p>Far too little discussion has focused on Chiller\u2019s muddled team ideals. She said athletes should stop whingeing about Rio\u2019s water quality while continuing to do so herself when it came to virtually everything else about the place; she said she\u2019d \u201cfight to the death\u201d for members of the Australian team, just not the ones about whom she wrote 16-page letters of complaint; she claimed Kyrgios didn\u2019t respect what it meant to be an Australian Olympian and a member of a team, but Chiller\u2019s own Olympic experience in 2000 finished when she locked herself in her bedroom at the athletes\u2019 village after her event. </p> <p>If all of this accurately represents the organisational mantras of the AOC, it\u2019s little wonder that so many of their pronouncements are met with cynicism and snark.</p> <p>Yet Chiller and the influential boosters who\u2019ve enabled her are now faced with a dilemma as the Games end; Australia\u2019s athletes both underperformed and, by the censorious standards imposed upon them, misbehaved. Both failings expose their brash leader\u2019s pious pre-Games bloviating for precisely what it was. Chiller confronts perhaps the harshest reality of all: even if she had presided over a medal bonanza, Australians don\u2019t hold ticker-tape parades for administrators.</p>",

Drinkwater follows in the footsteps of Kasper Schmeichel, Wes Morgan, Ben Chilwell, Riyad Mahrez, Andy King, Jamie Vardy and, of course, Ranieri, all of whom signed new deals this summer. Depending on how this season pans out, the bigger challenge for Leicester could be in keeping players in 12 months\u2019 time, yet the Midlands club will at least be in a position of strength when it comes to any offers that are received. <strong>Stuart James </strong><br><strong>\u2022 </strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/20/leicester-city-arsenal-premier-league-match-report\">Match report: Leicester 0-0 Arsenal</a><br><strong>\u2022 </strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/aug/19/arsene-wenger-arsenal-story-final-unhappy\">Ars\u00e8ne Wenger\u2019s Arsenal story heading for final, unhappy paragraph</a></p> <h2><strong>3) Mame Diouf drought a worry for Mark Hughes </strong></h2> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/21/peter-crouch-stoke-city-manchester-city-mike-dean-referees-penalties\">Stoke\u2019s Peter Crouch slams \u2018farcical\u2019 clampdown on contact at set pieces</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There were some obvious contrasts between Stoke and Manchester City on Saturday but perhaps none more stark than that regarding their respective centre-forwards. On one hand was Sergio Ag\u00fcero, whose two goals in City\u2019s 4-1 victory at the bet365 stadium took his tally to six in three matches and 26 in 31 club appearances this calendar year. On the other was Mame Diouf, who failed to score, failed to make an impact and who has scored only twice for his club in 2016. Diouf put in a shift for the home side but rarely looked as if he was going to score, something that can be said of Stoke\u2019s collection of centre-forwards in general. None scored more than five last season, with the bulk of goals coming from the creative players positioned just behind them, most notably Marko Arnautovic, whose tally of 11 made him the club\u2019s top scorer by some distance. In total, Stoke scored only 41 goals during the 2015/16 campaign, fewer than six of the teams that finished below them, including Newcastle United, who were relegated. A lack of a killer edge is a clear, long-standing problem for Mark Hughes\u2019s side and something that simply must be addressed if they are to make the step up to serious contenders for European football. Thankfully for Stoke, their manager is aware of that. \u201cThat\u2019s an area of the side that we want to improve and we\u2019re still in the market to bring in someone of quality,\u201d Hughes said. \u201cThere are a lot of good things that we do up to a point, we just haven\u2019t got that somebody who can create something for themselves.

Accordingly David Moyes was possibly a little startled to see his name on the teamsheet but this is where the Boro manager\u2019s policy of having at least two strong contenders for every position creates intensecompetition while keeping opponents guessing. Sure enough Stuani scored twice as his side won 2-1 at Sunderland. There are counter arguments in favour of fielding a settled team \u2013 and even Karanka does not like to change his back four frequently \u2013 but predicting Boro\u2019s starting XIs this season looks likely to be quite a challenge. <strong>Louise Taylor</strong> <br>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/21/sunderland-middlesbrough-premier-league-match-report\">Match report: Sunderland 1-2 Middlesbrough</a></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/aug/21/sunderland-middlesbrough-aitor-karanka-david-moyes\">Sunderland\u2019s high press leaves shaky defence exposed against Middlesbrough | Michael Cox</a> </p> </aside>  <h2><strong>5) Robert Snodgrass struts his best in Hull\u2019s thrilling start</strong></h2> <p>Scotland was once the home of wing wizards.

Snodgrass has a left foot that could have been educated at Harvard; his shooting, imaginative passing and dead-ball delivery have played a significant part in all four of Hull\u2019s goals in their thrilling start to the season. There is also a spiky cockiness to his play that instantly signposts his birthplace. He is a significant talent, who will be crucial if Hull are to continue to confound expectations. It makes one wonder why, at 28, he has spent most of his career in the lower leagues. <strong>Rob Smyth</strong> <br>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/20/swansea-city-hull-city-premier-league-match-report\">Match report: Swansea 0-2 Hull</a></p> <h2><strong>6) Spurs benefit from strength in numbers</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1a019e2cb3c5340ab6c474f8cc953478ddc47db3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1a019e2cb3c5340ab6c474f8cc953478ddc47db3/131_47_2329_1397/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Victor Wanyama celebrates with Tottenham\u2019s manager, Mauricio Pochettino, after scoring against Crystal Palace.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Victor Wanyama celebrates with Tottenham\u2019s manager, Mauricio Pochettino, after scoring against Crystal Palace.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Eddie Keogh/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It was not the reason why Tottenham\u2019s title challenge fizzled out last season but it must have been a concern that Harry Kane ended up playing 50 club games and Dele Alli 46 last season (and perhaps explains why both looked so weary at the Euros). Alli might have played against Crystal Palace had he not suffered illness during the week but, as Mauricio Pochettino noted afterwards, he now has a squad that means he has high-level players to leave out. He can play Vincent Janssen or Kane or both but the real strength is at the back of midfield. Perhaps Eric Dier and Victor Wanyama are more defensive than would be needed against a lower-half Premier League side but there is Moussa Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 to come back in when he has served the final two games of his six-game ban for gouging Diego Costa. It is not impossible against the best sides \u2013 maybe in the Champions league \u2013 Dier and Wanyama could hold with Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 operating just in front of them. Two signings seems to have significantly multiplied Pochettino\u2019s options. <strong>Jonathan Wilson </strong><br><strong>\u2022 </strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/20/tottenham-hotspur-crystal-palace-premier-league-match-report\">Match report: Tottenham 1-0 Crystal Palace</a><br><strong>\u2022 </strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/20/georges-kevin-nkoudou-tottenham-hotspur-transfer-marseille\">Spurs reach agreement over Georges-K\u00e9vin Nkoudou transfer</a></p> <h2><strong>7) New-look Watford let old habits die hard</strong></h2> <p>There may be a new manager and several new faces on show at Watford \u2013 with another pair, Roberto Pereyra and Youn\u00e8s Kaboul, introduced to supporters before kick-off on Saturday \u2013 but one of last season\u2019s key characteristics remained the same. They had a habit under Quique S\u00e1nchez Flores of starting home games against big teams impressively only to fade dramatically in the latter stages and let a result slip away. It was the same against Chelsea, where they were worthy of the 1-0 lead but lost their legs. Walter Mazzarri said some of his players, namely those who were at the European Championship, are not yet fully fit and faded after 70 minutes but can see improvement. Maybe they will learn to last the duration but it was impossible not to make comparisons with the home games against Manchester City, Arsenal and Tottenham last season where second-half collapses cost them points. <strong>Alan Smith</strong><br>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/20/watford-chelsea-premier-league-match-report\">Match report: Watford 1-2 Chelsea</a></p> <h2><strong>8) Ronald Koeman lauds quality of Gareth Barry</strong></h2> <p>Gareth Barry, knocking on 36 years of age, not only won three points for Everton against West Brom but also the highest praise from his manager. Barry\u2019s canny near-post header capped a game of intelligent play, both positionally and in possession. His latest boss, Ronald Koeman, acknowledged this enduring prowess in glowing terms. Barry was \u201cone of the best players I have managed,\u201d he said. \u201cHis cleverness in football is of the highest quality.\u201d While Koeman obviously respects not only the ability but the experience the former England international brings, he insists it is his job to support young talent. In Mason Holgate he may have another defensive prodigy to replace the one sold to Manchester City. Like John Stones, Holgate is a product of the Barnsley academy and has height and positional awareness enough that Koeman was willing to start him as part of a central defensive three. But after half an hour, and 1-0 down, Koeman changed his shape and Holgate excelled at right-back. Pairing lightning pace with delicate close control, he assisted Barry for his winner and could have scored himself too. The 19 year old has talent and working under Koeman should help him to develop it. <strong>Paul MacInnes</strong><br>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/20/west-bromwich-albion-everton-premier-league-match-report\">Match report: West Brom 1-2 Everton</a><br>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/20/west-bromwich-albion-everton-premier-league-match-report\">Everton reveal Romelu Lukaku will stay</a></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/aug/20/pep-guardiola-ruthless-joe-hart-manchester-city\">Pep Guardiola shows ruthlessness over Joe Hart but he is not a bad judge | Daniel Taylor</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>9) Bournemouth must be patient with Wilson</h2> <p>It is a sign of how highly Eddie Howe rates Callum Wilson that the striker started for Bournemouth instead of Benik Afobe and Lewis Grabban, even though he is yet to score since returning from a serious knee injury. Wilson scored a fine hat-trick against West Ham United last season and he must have fancied his chances against Slaven Bilic\u2019s side on Sunday. Yet he was rarely granted a sight of goal, which was partly down to a lack of service, and he does not quite look up to full speed yet. He has the potential to be an excellent striker at this level but his club will need to be patient with him. Wilson scored five times for Bournemouth last season in what was their debut Premier League campaign and the 24-year-old would have added to that tally had he not ruptured the anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee in September, an injury that kept him out for seven months. <strong>Jacob Steinberg</strong><br>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/21/west-ham-united-bournemouth-premier-league-match-report\">Match report: West Ham 1-0 Bournemouth</a><br></p> <h2><strong>10) Why hasn\u2019t Marcus Rashford played for Manchester United this season?</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a849c1d0aea417b04fbca5e1c10ce0273acdc88a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a849c1d0aea417b04fbca5e1c10ce0273acdc88a/20_136_2916_1749/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Marcus Rashford, right, on the Manchester United substitutes\u2019 bench with Michael Carrick and Memphis Depay during their Premier League opener against Bournemouth.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Marcus Rashford, right, on the bench with Michael Carrick and Memphis Depay during Mancheser United\u2019s league opener at Bournemouth.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: TGSPhoto/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It is understandable why Jos\u00e9 Mourinho started the new season with Marcus Rashford on the substitutes\u2019 bench. The selection of Zlatan Ibrahimovic up front was a no-brainer, Anthony Martial has more experience as a left-sided forward; and, though Rashford is a superior player to Wayne Rooney and Juan Mata, he does not yet have much first-team experience in their positions. But the fact Rashford has not come on in either league game, when both were as good as settled, might concern those who believe his astonishing progress in 2016 should not be stalled unless absolutely necessary. Individually all the substitutions made sense, especially for a manager like Mourinho who likes to make tactical changes to close the shop on. Collectively, however, they hint at the possibility that Mourinho \u2013 who has precise ideas about what makes an effective footballer \u2013 was not as wowed as everyone else by Rashford\u2019s performances last season. The development of young players is one of the most precarious things in sport, with few certainties and umpteen variables, the most important of which is confidence. Rashford must be starting to wonder whether his best chance of action is in the Europa League. <strong>Rob Smyth</strong><br><strong>\u2022 </strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/19/manchester-united-southampton-premier-league-match-report\">Match report: Manchester United 2-0 Southampton</a><br>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/20/manchester-united-jose-mourinho-southampton-jose-fonte\">Mourinho wants to buy Southampton\u2019s Jos\u00e9 Fonte</a></p>",
  "<p>Sitting in the passenger seat of Google\u2019s self driving car is a less bizarre experience than sitting in the driving seat, but it\u2019s still unsettling. In the streets of Mountain View, outside the headquarters of X (once Google X, in the post-Alphabet age it\u2019s moved out of mum and dad\u2019s house and dropped the prefix), I got the chance to do just that.</p> <p>It\u2019s partly unsettling because it\u2019s hard not to feel a flicker of anxiety when you look over and notice that the person driving the car hasn\u2019t got their hands on the wheel, even as you head towards a red light on a corner with a huge truck bearing down on you.</p> <p>It\u2019s partly because the software that drives the car isn\u2019t exactly ready for production yet, so every now and again something weird happens \u2013 a jerky overtake, a slight hesitation to squeeze through into an adjacent lane, or, as happened once, the car declaring for no obvious reason that \u201ca slight hiccup\u201d had occurred and that it was going to pull over.</p> <p>And it\u2019s partly because the future has come a lot sooner than anyone really thought. Even if Google takes far longer to start selling cars than it thinks it will (and senior figures in X tell me that they\u2019re confident something will hit the market before 2020), this technology is going to hit the real world somewhere soon, and it\u2019s going to change everything.</p> <p>Uber agrees. The taxi company on Thursday announced the latest phase of its own self-driving tests, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/aug/18/uber-riders-self-driving-cars\">putting its prototype cars</a> on the roads of Pittsburgh for real riders to hail them for the first time. They aren\u2019t quite self-driving \u2013 they still have a human driver for backup - but they\u2019re the next step for the company\u2019s drive to replace its \u201cdriver-partners\u201d (Uber is notoriously reluctant to grant Uber drivers full employment rights) with a fully automated fleet.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"eace1b22f2ed97ee6d861206e321422c07ea0da5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eace1b22f2ed97ee6d861206e321422c07ea0da5/225_381_4457_2674/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A self-driving Ford Fusion hybrid car is test driven, Thursday, Aug. 18, 2016, in Pittsburgh.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A self-driving Ford Fusion hybrid car is test driven in Pittsburgh.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jared Wickerham/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Until a month ago, though, you could be forgiven for thinking the self-driving revolution had already hit. Tesla Motors, the upstart electric car company headed by the charismatic serial entrepreneur Elon Musk, launched its heavily promoted \u201cautopilot\u201d feature to owners of its Model S cars in October 2015.</p> <p>The feature was labelled a \u201cpublic beta\u201d, and users were warned to always keep their hands on the steering wheel; but those messages were counteracted by bluster from Musk, who <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2015/03/19/the-tesla-model-s-will-get-early-autopilot-mode-in-about-three-months/#.fxvsp1:ua4A\">declared in March</a> that year that \u201cWe\u2019re now almost able to travel all the way from San Francisco to Seattle without the driver touching any controls at all\u201d. And, of course, the name Autopilot itself does little to suggest to the average user that the car does not, in fact, drive itself.</p> <p>Those mixed messages <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jun/30/tesla-autopilot-death-self-driving-car-elon-musk\">led to tragedy in May</a>, when a Tesla driver, Joshua Brown, died in a crash which happened while Autopilot was in charge of the car. As Tesla put it, the crash happened when \u201cNeither Autopilot nor the driver noticed\u201d a tractor trailer crossing the highway in front of the car; the following day, it emerged that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jul/01/tesla-driver-killed-autopilot-self-driving-car-harry-potter\">Brown may have been watching a movie</a> as his car drove itself.</p> <h2>The problem of semantics</h2> <p>But the question of whether or not Brown had been paying attention to the road misses the more important point: he didn\u2019t think he needed to. It\u2019s a point Tesla itself tacitly admitted in China this week, when it changed the name of its Autopilot system from a phrase that loosely translates to \u201cself-driving\u201d to one that more closely resembles \u201cdriver assist\u201d. \u201cWe want to highlight to non-English speaking consumers that Autopilot is a driver-assist function,\u201d a Tesla spokesperson <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/tesla-adjusts-its-autopilot-pitch-in-china-1471326080\">told the Wall Street Journal</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"234f626c4d7a567f74a0463b382090c945012351\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/234f626c4d7a567f74a0463b382090c945012351/0_150_4000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A driver with hands off the wheel in a Tesla.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tesla has highlighted that Autopilot is a \u2018driver-assist\u2019 function in the wake of May\u2019s tragedy.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bloomberg/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Other car companies have similar technology, but don\u2019t quite sell it in the same way \u2013 or with the same bluster. Nissan rolled out its ProPilot technology in Japan this July, for instance, while BMW\u2019s Driver Assistance systems in its 4 series can follow the car in front or warn the driver if they veer out of lane. ProPilot is sold as \u201cautonomous driving\u201d and \u201cintelligent driving\u201d. The semantics of naming are an important consideration for the companies: is their language encouraging drivers to think that their attention no longer needs to be focused on the road ahead?</p> <p>But in X\u2019s experience, modulating the tone of your advertising just isn\u2019t enough. The very existence of almost-but-not-quite-perfect autonomous driving introduces whole new dangers. Nathaniel Fairfield, the principal engineer with X\u2019s self-driving car team who \u201cdrove\u201d me round Mountain View, said that people just don\u2019t pay attention to the road, no matter what you tell them.</p> <p>\u201cYou can tell them it\u2019s a bundle of self-driving assist systems, but when the sucker drives them for the next three hours just dandy, they rely on their short term experience with it, and if it\u2019s been doing well, they\u2019ll just relax.</p> <p>\u201cYou can say whatever you want to say, and people are going to interpret it however they interpret it, and at the end of the day you end up with whatever happens.\u201d</p> <p>X has had its own experience with that fact. In the early days of its self-driving car experiments, it loaned the modified Lexus SUVs which formed the basis of its first cars to employees, to use on their commutes. Even though they had been told to keep focused on the road, and their hands near the wheel \u2013 and even though they were in a car owned by their employer, and knew they were being monitored by some of the most all-pervasive telemetry you can put in a vehicle \u2013 they still rapidly ended up goofing off in the cars.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bc5bcea39f9e0aa3687f614f2f2e00845df92abd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bc5bcea39f9e0aa3687f614f2f2e00845df92abd/0_149_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Test drivers use a Lexus SUV, built as a self-driving car, to map the area prior to a journey without a driver in control, in Phoenix, Arizona April 5, 2016.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Test drivers use a Lexus SUV, built as a self-driving car, to map the area prior to a journey without a driver in control, in Phoenix, Arizona April 5, 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>To a certain extent, that too can be approached as a simple technology problem. It\u2019s not hard to imagine a driver assist function paired with simple sensors to ensure that the driver\u2019s attention really is focused on the road, just as cars today emit ear-splitting alerts if you try to drive them without wearing your seatbelt. But that\u2019s an engineering problem that Fairfield and the rest of the X team aren\u2019t interested in tackling.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re defining success as pissing off a customer enough that they have to perpetually [pay attention],\u201d he said. \u201cPeople don\u2019t want to do that! People have better things to do with their time in cars these days\u201d than sit and watch the road, and the ultimate goal of the self-driving car project is to let people actually do that.\u201d</p> <p>Andrew Chatham, another principal engineer who had acted as Fairfield\u2019s bug tracker during the ride, jumped in: \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019d even claim that it\u2019s impossible to solve this problem, but it\u2019s not the problem that we want to be working on.\u201d</p> <p>Of course, the counterpoint is that it\u2019s still much better to be an irritated driver, being forced to keep your eyes on the road while a driver-assist system ensures that you don\u2019t accidentally rear-end the car in front, than it is to be dead. The technology X has today is capable of feats beyond the wildest dreams of automotive safety technicians even a decade ago: even in my 10-minute jaunt round Mountain View, the car clocked a police cruiser by the lights on its roof, navigated a junction governed only by a stop sign, and carried out a tricky lane-merge in the queue for the lights. Those features could be saving lives today, rather than being held for an indeterminate future.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s entirely true,\u201d said Chatham, \u201cand I don\u2019t think we want to call off anyone from what they\u2019re doing. Our intent is not to slag them [off], but the system we have built is aimed at full autonomy, and it is therefore much more complicated than a lot of these other systems. This is not the engineeringly efficient or cost-effective way to build something that just helps you stay in your lane.\u201d</p> <p>Fairfield, though, added a note of caution to the idea that such systems are even a desirable stepping stone. \u201cTo be clear, there\u2019s a very complicated calculus: what are people willing to buy? How\u2019s that going to work out? How much safety do you get? How much is that true safety, or how much is that just lulling people into a false sense of security?</p> <p>\u201cOr maybe you\u2019re very clear about it, but how are they going to take that or internalise it or interpret it or how are they going to use it. And there\u2019s a degree of uncertainty, and definitely room for people of good principal to have disagreements.\u201d</p> <h2>\u2018It\u2019s imperative that a human be behind the wheel\u2019</h2> <p>Other disagreements pose more existential questions for the whole project, though. John Simpson, a US consumer watchdog, has been <a href=\"http://www.consumerwatchdog.org/newsrelease/consumer-watchdog-says-nhtsa-must-protect-safety-require-steering-wheel-driver-robot-car\">one of the loudest voices</a> calling on Alphabet to clarify its policy on self-driving cars as a matter of urgency, and particularly to open up about how its system works, and doesn\u2019t work. When one of its test vehicles <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/mar/09/google-self-driving-car-crash-video-accident-bus\">swiped a bus in February</a>, for instance, the company declined to release the telemetry from inside the car, even as it was otherwise very open about the circumstances of the accident.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/video/2016/mar/09/google-self-driving-car-crash-public-bus-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/4he4b\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2470700\"            data-video-name=\"Google self-driving car collides with public bus \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority\"            data-video-poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2016/3/9/1457553054488/KP_1832094_crop_640x480.jpg\"> <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-56e07eace4b0dda746748d35\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2016/3/9/1457553054488/KP_1832094_crop_640x480.jpg\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/03/09/160309Googlecarbuscrash_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/03/09/160309Googlecarbuscrash.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2016/03/09/160309Googlecarbuscrash_large.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/03/09/160309Googlecarbuscrash_synd_768k_vp8.webm\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2016/03/09/160309Googlecarbuscrash_small.3gp\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/video/2016/mar/09/google-self-driving-car-crash-public-bus-video\">Google self-driving car collides with public bus</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Those questions bear down on Alphabet, but are ultimately a call for canny regulators to work with the company in negotiating rules for the new normal. A wild west where self-driving car companies set the rules of engagement \u2013 even in response to successful campaigning for openness \u2013 isn\u2019t a desirable state of affairs for either the companies, who prefer to operate in a realm of certainty, nor drivers and passengers, who deserve more in the case of accidents than the obfuscatory statements released by Tesla in the wake of its first fatal crash.</p> <p>Simpson is also vehemently against the idea of a fully automatic car, taking the exact opposite stance to X. \u201cIt\u2019s imperative that a human be behind the wheel capable of taking control when necessary. Self-driving robot cars simply aren\u2019t ready to safely manage too many routine traffic situations without human intervention,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat the disengagement reports show is that there are many everyday routine traffic situations with which the self-driving robot cars simply can\u2019t cope.\u201d Which is, in a way, obviously true, and why X\u2019s car remains a research project rather than something you can buy today.</p> <p>The question is how long that will remain true for. \u201cThe cars are really, really capable,\u201d says Fairfield, \u201cand the rate at which they\u2019re getting better is actually increasing.\u201d</p> <p>When will it be good enough that they, at least, are happy with it hitting the streets without a fallback? \u201cNot too long.\u201d</p>",

It could be alongside or in place of Watson,\u201d the source said. <br></p> <p>A spokesman for Smith said he would ask the party\u2019s national executive committee to bring forward changes within a year of his leadership and before any future leadership or deputy leadership contest.<br></p> <p>Many female Labour MPs were disappointed that a chance to have a woman as leader was lost when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/19/angela-eagle-labour-leader-gender-party-patriarchy\">Smith knocked Angela Eagle out of the competition</a> against Corbyn.</p> <p>Critics have complained that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/11/labour-mayoral-candidates-men-feminism-corbyn\">all three of the party\u2019s mayoral candidates for the elections next year are male</a>, and point out that Labour had also fielded men in the two major mayoral contests held this year \u2013 Sadiq Khan in London and Marvin Rees in Bristol.</p> <p>New figures released today demonstrate the growth in the party\u2019s membership. It is estimated there were 343,500 fully paid up members entitled to a vote in the election. <br></p> <p>Their numbers will be supplemented by 129,000 registered supporters who made a one-off payment of \u00a325 last month so they would be able to vote.</p> <p>A further 168,000 affiliated supporters who are members of affiliated organisations such as trade unions also have a vote \u2013 although that number is expected to rise as the unions are still processing some 20,000 applications.</p> <p>Corbyn last night launched his own plans to democratise the party if he wins, including a plan to \u201ccreate a charter of rights for party members and support moves to widen representation on the national executive to reflect the huge increase in party membership\u201d.</p> <p>His enemies claim that he would seek to control the party\u2019s executive to tighten the grip of the left of the party.</p> <p>In a further boost for Corbyn, seven leaders from some of Britain\u2019s most prominent unions including Len McCluskey have written to the Guardian endorsing Corbyn as leader and urging their members to support him. <br></p> <p>At a setpiece meeting in his constituency on Monday morning, Smith will appeal to party members by outlining the scale of the crisis facing the Labour movement.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/19/labour-leadership-1000-councillors-sign-letter-backing-owen-smith\">More than 1,000 Labour councillors sign letter backing Owen Smith</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Meanwhile, supporters of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/jeremy-corbyn\">Corbyn</a> have dismissed criticisms by Sadiq Khan after the London mayor urged Labour party members to ditch their leader and back his rival. <br></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/20/ditch-jeremy-corbyn-before-too-late-sadiq-khan-tells-labour\">In a stinging attack in the Observer</a> on Sunday, Khan said Corbyn had failed to win the trust of voters and that Labour was extremely unlikely to secure a return to power as long as he remained leader.<br></p> <p>Matt Wrack, the leftwing general secretary of the Fire Brigades Union and a strong supporter of Corbyn, said Khan\u2019s comments were \u201ca little bit disappointing but possibly no great surprise\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cSadiq comes from that part of the Labour party that was in government under Blair and Brown,\u201d Wrack told BBC News.</p> <p>Party members will receive their ballots by post as well as an email with an online ballot code \u2013 giving them a choice as to how they vote \u2013 but supporters will receive only an online ballot.

  "<p>It\u2019s fair to say that among those dependent on public transport, buses don\u2019t have a good reputation for turning up on time. So when a model for a sci-fi looking \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/26/china-straddling-floating-bus-beat-traffic-jams\">straddling bus</a>\u201d capable of gliding over traffic was unveiled in China in May (<a href=\"http://www.chinahush.com/2010/07/31/straddling-bus-a-cheaper-greener-and-faster-alternative-to-commute/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed:+ChinaHush+%28ChinaHush%29\">six years after first being mooted</a>), we can safely say that the hopes of city commuters were, no pun intended, raised.</p> <p>In the case of the so-called Transit Explore Bus (TEB), however, it seems that potential delays are the least of its troubles. Just one week after a \u201croad test\u201d of the futuristic bus \u2013 which, in the words of the <a href=\"http://shanghaiist.com/2016/08/02/straddling_bus_launch.php\">Shanghaiist</a>, proved: \u201cThey built it. They actually built it\u201d \u2013 <a href=\"http://china.huanqiu.com/article/2016-08/9263351.html\">reports have emerged</a> in the <a href=\"http://news.sina.cn/news_zt/swbt?from=qudao&amp;wm=3049_b111\">Chinese media</a> suggesting that not only is the bus\u2019s current manifestation completely unfeasible, but that TEB might even be some kind of elaborate <a href=\"http://economics.about.com/od/financialmarkets/f/ponzi_scheme.htm\">Ponzi scheme</a>.</p> <p>Such allegations have been indignantly refuted by the inventor Song Youzhou, who told the website <a href=\"http://www.sixthtone.com/news/chinese-media-call-straddling-bus-scam\">Sixth Tone</a>: \u201cWe haven\u2019t done anything wrong at all. The latest tests show that the bus design is entirely possible.\u201d</p> <p>But leaving such murkier allegations aside, the ever-growing list of technical criticisms levelled at the project might seem enough to make Song and his team give up on their radical bus-on-stilts dream.</p> <p>Detailed most comprehensively by <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/2016/08/concerns-chinas-traffic-slaying-straddling-bus/?mbid=social_fb\">Wired</a>, these include the fact that that the TEB has a ground clearance of just 2.1 metres, meaning only small vehicles will be able to drive under it. It\u2019s also unclear what a car is meant to do if the bus rolls over it when approaching a junction. And, keeping the electric vehicle charged would be a real challenge. On top of this, bridges, lamp posts and road signs would all have to be re-thought. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2016/may/26/transit-explore-bus-above-road-traffic-china-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/4jtnj\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2513503\"            data-video-name=\"Bus that moves above traffic jams: model unveiled in China \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"CCTV\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-5746b5abe4b038ba175e44e6\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/05/26/150526straddling_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/05/26/150526straddling.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2016/05/26/150526straddling_large.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/05/26/150526straddling_synd_768k_vp8.webm\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2016/05/26/150526straddling_small.3gp\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2016/may/26/transit-explore-bus-above-road-traffic-china-video\">Bus that moves above traffic jams: model unveiled in China</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>But perhaps the most cutting criticism of all: since the TEB runs on tracks, it\u2019s technically not even a bus. It\u2019s a train. </p> <p>Even the \u201croad test\u201d, in hindsight, was found by local media to be unconvincing. It took place on a 300 metre highway and was hardly equivalent to actual traffic conditions. Was the test just a chance to show that TEB had actually built something? Anything? Playing it down since, the authorities in Qinhuangdao, where the bus was tested, have said the TEB will just be used for tourism rather than major transportation.</p> <p>As the likelihood of the TEB coming to fruition in any meaningful way crumbles, descending from transport-solution-of-the-future to a folly evocative of that episode of the Simpsons when <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marge_vs._the_Monorail\">Springfield gets a monorail</a>, it looks set to join the ranks of other well meaning, but ultimately futile, urban traffic-solving ideas. </p> <p>Like, for example, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/aug/14/hyperloop-elon-musk-futuristic-technology-transport\">the Hyperloop</a> (emphasis on the \u201chype\u201d), in which pods full of people would in theory be fired down a large tube at speeds of up to 750mph.

In the case of SkyTran, the argument is that it\u2019s far more economical than building an underground system; the company claims it will cost just $13m (\u00a39.8m) for every mile of track, compared to $160m per mile of subway.</p> <p>Still, it is yet to appear in a city. It was due to launch in Tel Aviv in 2014, and <a href=\"http://www.timesofisrael.com/skytran-demo-not-quite-ready-for-prime-time/\">then at the end of 2015</a>.

That is made all the more sickening when you consider just how vulnerable homeless women are. <a href=\"http://www.crisis.org.uk/data/files/publications/Homelessness%20kills%20-%20Executive%20Summary.pdf\">Research shows</a> (pdf) homeless women are highly likely to suffer with poor mental health, addiction problems, and, on average, to die at just 43 years old. </p> <p>The communities and local government select committee recognised that there is insufficient support to help women escape homelessness.<strong> </strong>And this is clear from the statistics. Last year 1,094 women slept rough in London, that\u2019s up from 658 in <a href=\"http://data.london.gov.uk/dataset/chain-reports\">2010-11</a>. This is likely to be a significant underestimate as homeless women are more likely to hide for fear of violence, or enter into risky sexual partnerships to stay off the streets. This means they\u2019re often missed in the statistics. </p> <p>Homelessness services are often set up with men in mind and they can be frightening places for vulnerable women who\u2019ve experienced abuse and violence. They will often need women-only services in order to feel safe enough to engage with support. </p> <p>The prime minister has a strong record on tackling violence against women and girls. Her tenure at the Home Office oversaw significant pressure on the police and Crown Prosecution Service to improve responses, new offences of revenge porn and coercive control introduced, more of a focus on \u201chonour\u201d based violence, and a welcome recognition of the links between different forms of abuse. Now she is faced with a stark reminder to turn her attention to some of the most vulnerable women in our society.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/jul/16/homelessness-london-survey-evolve\">Scared, lonely, invisible; hunt is on to find hidden army of homeless women</a> </p> </aside>  <p>At the moment, there is little cross-cutting leadership aimed at tackling homeless women\u2019s problems. The government needs to do much more to address the problems homeless women face, and to prevent women becoming homeless in the first place. That\u2019s why the select committee\u2019s recommendation of a cross-government strategy is important. But this must explicitly recognise women\u2019s needs or they risk yet again being invisible. </p> <p>There are three key things Theresa May can do to tackle the abuse and violence faced by homeless women. The first is setting out a clear, cross-government strategy that lays out how every relevant part of local and national government is going to respond to homeless women. The second is ensuring gender specific and trauma-sensitive services for homeless women are commissioned right across the country. And finally, to make sure support is going to where it\u2019s needed, the government needs collect much better data on homelessness and gender, including gender breakdowns of rough sleeping counts. </p> <p>Theresa May has shown her commitment to addressing violence against women and girls. She now needs to start tackling the abuses faced by some of the most excluded women in society. Tackling homelessness will lift some extraordinarily vulnerable people back into society. And for women, it can help prevent huge amounts of trauma, suffering, and violence. The opportunity is there: will the prime minister show that her commitment to women extends to those struggling at the very bottom of the pile?</p> <h2><a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/housing/register/\">Join Guardian Housing </a>to read more pieces like this and follow us on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GuardianHousing\">@GuardianHousing</a> to keep up with the latest social housing insight and analysis.</h2>",
  "<p>In a sweltering Edinburgh room Richard Gadd stands, a perspiring vision in pink lycra shorts, before an audience who are all on their feet. The applause is heavy, loud, interjected with occasional whoops and shrieks, and Gadd gazes out at them all, a look of surprise on his face. He blinks vigorously. \u201cThank you,\u201d he says. \u201cHonestly. This has been the fucking toughest four years of my life.\u201d</p> <p>Last year, the standup was the underground hit of the festival with his show Waiting for Gaddot, based on the absurdist premise that he didn\u2019t actually turn up for the hour-long show until the final five minutes. It was chaotic and crude and painfully funny. Gadd admits he could have ridden this wave of success for a second year and \u201ceasily done <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/aug/15/richard-gadd-edinburgh-festival-review-banshee-labyrinth-waiting-for-gaddot-ben-target-ian-smith\">Waiting for Gaddot</a> part II\u201d. Instead, he wrote the most searingly personal show of his career.</p> <p>Monkey See, Monkey Do explores masculinity and the dangers and stigmas attached to the very definition of what \u2013 even in today\u2019s supposedly progressive society of metrosexuals and stay-at-home-dads \u2013 it is to be \u201ca man\u201d. It\u2019s a popular theme at the fringe this year, but Gadd\u2019s show feels braver as it emerges that his own crisis of masculinity was triggered by a sexual assault four years ago.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3fd2266cf0fd97428f49d5b15101497a3a42b1d7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3fd2266cf0fd97428f49d5b15101497a3a42b1d7/117_642_5191_3115/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018I used to run just to feel normal\u2019 \u2026 Monkey See, Monkey Do is performed on a treadmill.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I used to run just to feel normal\u2019 \u2026 Monkey See, Monkey Do is performed on a treadmill.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I meet Gadd the evening after his second show, which is the first time in his comedy career that he has received a standing ovation. It\u2019s a moment, he says, he will never forget, mainly because he never really believed he would make it up on to the stage in the first place. \u201cI\u2019ve been thinking about writing this show for years, but I always postponed it because there\u2019s something about writing things down that makes it very real. I never believed I was going to do this up till yesterday.\u201d He stops, then adds: \u201cThis is the most truthful thing I\u2019ve ever done.\u201d</p> <p>For Gadd, a motivating factor in writing the show was to focus on the warped and outdated idea of manhood that he sees as still \u201cdangerously\u201d prevalent today \u2013 and that was a pivotal part of his own struggles to come to terms with what happened to him. Comedy might seem a strange realm to discuss these issues, but for Gadd the opportunity to bring laughter into this dark chapter of his life is a form of catharsis. \u201cI was very down on my life, very ashamed. I punished myself so much and my self-esteem was so low. \u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/aug/12/richard-gadd-review-banshee-labyrinth-edinburgh\">Richard Gadd review \u2013 grindhouse gags give way to courageous confession</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It is visibly tough for him to speak about it. He writhes and squirms, wrapping his arms over his face. It is, after all, just a few days since the show opened and his experiences of the past four years came into the public realm. Now, on a daily basis, he is recounting a time when, \u201cit was just about getting through the day\u201d.</p> <p>You don\u2019t have to say anything you don\u2019t want to, I tell him.

I don\u2019t think anyone knows how bad it is until it happens.\u201d Gadd pauses, then breaks into a tentative laugh. \u201cWhat doesn\u2019t kill you makes you stronger, <em>I think.</em>\u201d</p> <p>For him, the incident was a dividing line in his life. Looking conflicted, he says: \u201cI am a completely different person than I was. It changes your life.

As I ran I would put on the Pogues or Flogging Molly. These angry tunes for my angry life.\u201d He was repressing what had happened, \u201ctelling myself, \u2018Don\u2019t think of that, don\u2019t think of that.\u2019 Swallowing my thoughts and feelings.\u201d But then he began telling those closest to him what had happened.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7f015385b3706a02806a6358f9a1cf663d042d0b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7f015385b3706a02806a6358f9a1cf663d042d0b/0_0_1920_1152/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Previous shows were \u2018loud romps, a few degrees away from me as a person\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Previous shows were \u2018loud romps, a few degrees away from me as a person\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI was always worried what people would think and that they would judge \u2013 but nobody gave a shit.

Previous routines were, he says, \u201cloud romps, a few degrees away from me as a person.\u201d There were dark hints (\u201clike one of those gas canisters, relieving a bit of tension each time\u201d) but now was the time to \u201clet it all out\u201d.</p> <p>In the show Gadd talks about how, after the incident, he fell victim to a crippling inner monologue of anxiety \u2013 the monkey that still rattles him throughout our conversation. It also saw him adopt a more fluid approach to his own sexuality. Yet he is mostly plagued by how much he thought to himself, at the time, that that wasn\u2019t something that happened to \u201cguys like me\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I thought of myself as a man and I felt like that was taken from me, and I\u2019m ashamed of that now</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cI\u2019m the man playing football twice a week with my football pals. Or watching boxing.\u201d He says: \u201cIf I\u2019m being honest, I thought of myself as a man and I felt like that was taken from me, and I\u2019m ashamed of that now. But I felt like that was the story I wanted and I needed to tell with this show because it was just the part of it that seemed to bother me more than anything.\u201d</p> <p>Gadd says he was born into a liberal family who couldn\u2019t have been more supportive and yet he still grew up with anxieties about masculinity. He sees this as his chance to challenge toxic ideas of stiff-upper-lip strength. \u201cI\u2019ve bungee jumped and skydived and done all that fear bullshit, but the scariest thing I\u2019ve done in my life was admitting who I am to people. Maybe the measure of a man is admitting how scared he is sometimes.\u201d</p> <p>Gadd pauses for a moment. The lack of male figures in the public eye admitting they have experienced sexual assault is glaring, he notes, and ensured he felt even more isolated. Even now, he feels a lone voice. He is right. It\u2019s why the show feels like one of the most courageous hours of comedy I\u2019ve ever watched.</p> <p>\u201cIf I think of my life, even before the incident, all the issues and neuroses, fundamentally it\u2019s been guilt that I\u2019m not living up to being a man. And it\u2019s crazy. People are so obsessed with diagnoses and definitions \u2013 we cannot resist putting people in a box. That\u2019s why <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/tom-hardy?page=2\">Tom Hardy</a>, in every interview, is hounded about his sexuality. It\u2019s why <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/john-travolta\">John Travolta</a> is followed out of his car and into his house \u2013 because people <em>need</em> to know where people fit.

But it is also a way for Gadd to right a wrong from previous shows. A major critique of his past work by the Guardian\u2019s comedy critic Brian Logan was that they were \u201cobsessed with gay sex. Three times in the first half-hour, Gadd gets molested or threatened with molestation by predatory gay men \u2013 which is presented as hilarious.\u201d The decision to make light of sexual assault in his comedy is one Gadd regrets now as \u201ca poor artistic decision.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat criticism of my show really hurt because I remember thinking, \u2018If only he knew.\u2019 I was trying to convince myself at the time that you could joke about these things \u2013 I was poking fun at it because I wanted to reduce the gravitas of what had happened to me.\u201d</p> <p>Gadd is still clearly trying to flee his demons. But while he has no answer to the question that opens his show \u2013 \u201cWho is the real Richard Gadd?\u201d, he has at least come to stop caring whether he is adequately living up to being a man \u2013 whatever that means.</p> <p>\u201cI believed that life was a stack of boxes and that I needed to fit into one of them.

That strategy was perfectly suited to the collective psychosis of the EU referendum and its aftermath. As the farce of fragmenting leadership campaigns descended into Shakespearean tragedy, May seemed to glide into Downing Street, frictionless and unopposed. At the very start her composure and poise were sufficient \u2013 a signal that the government was in the hands of a grown-up. Now she needs to introduce herself more fully to the public, unveiling the pith behind the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/30/theresa-may-sets-out-one-nation-conservative-pitch-for-leadership\" title=\"\">\u201cone-nation\u201d slogans</a> and the type of society she aspires to nurture.</p> <p>Naturally, her team is focused on her speech at the <a href=\"https://conservativepartyconference.com/index/\" title=\"\">Conservative party conference in Birmingham</a>. But that is some way in the future. The challenge of self-definition cannot wait until October, or the autumn statement later in the year.

Already there has been an unseemly turf war between Liam Fox, the international trade secretary, and Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary, over the international commercial function of HMG.

Having appointed Fox to his new role and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/16/johnson-davis-fox-three-brexiteers\" title=\"\">David Davis to be Brexit secretary</a>, May was setting the scene for a three-way battle for control of Britain\u2019s departure from the EU. As if to dramatise the struggle, she has asked Johnson, Fox and Davis to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/23/chevening-house-share-rules-liam-fox-boris-johnson-david-davis\" title=\"\">share Chevening</a>, the grace-and-favour country house that is generally allocated to the foreign secretary (William Hague spent many happy hours in its fabulous library).</p> <p>In practice it should be Davis, reporting to the PM, who calls the shots.

According to Davis\u2019s timetable, there must first be six months of detailed research and stress-testing, with particular attention paid to the likely impact of Brexit upon the service economy. He faces institutional hostility in both houses of parliament, and is basing his calculations upon the assumption that our soon- to-be former EU partners do not want a trade war. It is a daunting challenge that will require all his streetfighting and cerebral nous.</p> <p>Those who know May tell me that she wants to be remembered as more than the steersman of Brexit, important though that is.

She asks each person where they are from, how old they are, and if they are travelling alone. \u201cWe don\u2019t wear sunglasses, because we need to have eye contact. It\u2019s about humanity. It\u2019s big smiles saying: \u2018You\u2019re now safe. This is where you are. This is what\u2019s going to happen next.\u2019 What surprised me is how polite people are. How they take their time to say thank you.\u201d<br></p> <p>Once all the survivors were safely on board, and being tended to, the crew of the Aquarius also felt it was right on this occasion to recover the bodies of the women and one man who died. \u201cFor several hours we tried to keep the living on one side of the boat. The bodies had spent hours in the water, so we were trying to protect the living from seeing that. The doctor took pictures for identification, because families will never know what happened to their loved ones.\u201d When they reached the port in Sicily the Italian Red Cross were there, with coffins and flowers for every person who died.<br></p> <p>\u201cThe tough MSF doctors who have been going from war to war cried because of the flowers,\u201d says Hadj-Sahraoui. \u201cI was one of the suckers who cried a lot.\u201d She says that people who do humanitarian work need to learn to take care of themselves, because there\u2019s a lot of emotional burnout. MSF staff have psychological debriefings before and after they go on missions, and after extreme experiences like this one.<br></p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve been doing this type of job for a long time now,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd you never get used to it \u2013 that is a good thing. It gives you that drive.

She also goes to international summits about migration \u2013 there\u2019s one at the UN in September 2016.<br></p> <p>As an advocacy manager, Hadj-Sahraoui\u2019s job on the boat was to interview as many people as possible, to understand what happened, and to collect testimonies that she can use in her campaigning. \u201cI collected a testimony from a woman who for the first day was just staring at the floor. Later she opened up and talked about fighting for her life, and how thankful she felt because it had been so close. And how she couldn\u2019t help a pregnant woman and she had died.\u201d<br></p> <p>Those testimonies support MSF\u2019s work campaigning for safe and legal ways for people to get to Europe. \u201cWe\u2019ve had, since the beginning of the year, 3,000 die in the Mediterranean Sea trying to cross. And it\u2019s so unnecessary. I think it\u2019s important to remind people of the risks that migrants are taking in order to cross and the very high price they are paying.\u201d<br></p> <p>Some of the women Hadj-Sahraoui interviewed told her that they had been gang-raped in Libya for extended periods of time. \u201cSome European countries are considering doing a deal with Libya to send refugees back there. I do think that governments need to be made aware of these things. Really sending women back to Libya would be sending them back to hell.\u201d<br></p> <p>Hadj-Sahraoui studied law and is an expert in the Middle East. She worked for Amnesty International for 10 years before joining MSF three months ago. \u201cHaving regional or country expertise makes you very valuable for the organisation.

Is \u201cstrong\u201d just \u201cskinny\u201d rebranded? And why does it all come loaded with this weird front-facing pressure? By its very nature, fitspo wants you to show your muscle off: to tweet it, Instagram it, Facebook it, Snapchat it. Women, once again, are being put on display.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/apr/20/fitspo-strong-skinny-social-media-food-abs-better-living-body-fascism\">Fitspo: how strong became the new skinny</a> </p> </aside>  <p>What is so pernicious about this movement is that feeling bad about our bodies is being dressed up as female emancipation, wrapped up in the idea of self-control. If you want to look good, you just have to work harder. You\u2019ll feel pain now, but you will feel great tomorrow. Look at her! Do you think she just woke up like this? No! She sweated in the gym. (Remember, ladies, \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/may/06/things-my-yoga-teacher-says-quotes\" title=\"\">sweat is just fat crying</a>\u201d.)</p> <p>If you said any of this out loud, to a friend, you\u2019d probably both have an attack of the giggles. But somehow, in the private glow of the laptop, or phone, these images hold sway over us. Why? Because the messages are so familiar. We\u2019ve been hearing them our whole lives in the language of the diet industry. We already know that we should suffer for our bodies to look right; we already know that we should critique, and pick, and compare, and judge, and measure, and ultimately feel dissatisfied. This is our zone.</p> <p>Depressingly, it\u2019s fast becoming the case for men too. Reggie Yates\u2019s BBC documentary, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b06svrw2\" title=\"\">Dying for a Six Pack</a>, broadcast earlier this year, brought tears to my eyes as I watched young men risk their lives, waste their bank balances, and ultimately damage their own mental health \u2013 all in the pursuit of the right shaped abdominal stack. Which, inevitably, never materialised. Because all our bodies are different and we won\u2019t all get six packs, even if we work out in a sauna, on steroids, with our gut wrapped in cling film. The narrative was so eye-gougingly familiar I wanted to shout in despair at the TV.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Skinny was bad enough, but now we need a six pack and a tight booty that looks like it\u2019s been implanted with beachballs</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Rather than \u201cstrong\u201d paving the way to female liberation, it all just smacks of new pressures to look a certain way, to conform to a new body trend. Skinny was bad enough, but now we need a six pack and a tight booty that looks like it\u2019s been implanted with beachballs. Plenty of sports at least offer the possibility of inclusivity \u2013 but this exercise trend feels entirely elitist. It\u2019s expensive, it involves tight-fitting lycra and revealing crop-top outfits: just how many women are we further alienating in an already alienated section of the population?</p> <p>Some will argue, inevitably, that fitspo is an improvement on what went before: a necessity, even. We have an obesity crisis, society is less active than ever, gyms and hot yoga being cool are good things \u2013 right? And not all media outlets are to blame. At the turn of the year the US editor at Women\u2019s Health announced a <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/nation-now/2016/01/06/womens-health-magazine-bans-bikini-body-drop-two-sizes-cover/78368106/\" title=\"\">ban on some of the worst phrases</a> that have traditionally graced its covers \u2013 including \u201cdiet\u201d, \u201cshrink\u201d, \u201cdrop two sizes\u201d, and \u201cbikini body\u201d. Good for them. But until we stop polarising these issues \u2013 from obesity to fitspo \u2013 profiling the extremes as though it\u2019s only one option or the other, will we ever truly find a healthy space to live in?</p> <p>So why do we insist on perpetuating this punitive approach? Why are physical goals so deeply attached to attaining a certain type of body image?

  "<p>Looking at the negligible returns offered on cash investments, Edward Cunningham started searching for alternatives. Instead of going to the stock market or buying up gold bars, however, the 45-year-old from Sherborne in Dorset turned to the internet, and last September invested in the digital currency bitcoin. Since then his stake has more than doubled.</p> <p>Bitcoin is a paperless, bankless, stateless currency which exists on computers, and carries with it a whiff of peril for investors. Cunningham admits to being nervous when he first signed up to trade in the currency, especially when he had to make his first deposit via a bank in Estonia. \u201cIt all turned out well and I bought my first coins for $225 each, well below today\u2019s price of around $575,\u201d he says.</p> <p>The price of bitcoin has fluctuated wildly since it was launched in 2009. Six years ago, two pizzas were bought for 10,000 bitcoin. By 2013, each bitcoin peaked in value at $1,000.</p> <p>Coupled with these enormous peaks and troughs have been hacking controversies. Earlier this month almost 120,000 bitcoin, worth around $78m, were stolen from Hong Kong-based Bitfinex, one of the most popular cryptocurrency exchanges, causing a 20% drop in the value of the currency.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"00eb9f776230a0b04e199d47de650dad79343a43\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/00eb9f776230a0b04e199d47de650dad79343a43/45_35_398_398/398.jpg\" alt=\"Investor Edward Cunningham is confident in his bitcoin  holdings\" width=\"398\" height=\"398\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Investor Edward Cunningham is confident in his bitcoin holdings</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Edward Cunningham</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Despite such drops Cunningham is ahead on his investment and feels positive about the currency, which is now being used for payment by companies such as Tesla and Microsoft, and is confident his investment will grow further. So, is it time for others to follow his cryptocurrency lead?</p> <h2><strong>What exactly is bitcoin?</strong></h2> <p>Started by a small group of hackers, bitcoin is unlike traditional currencies in that it has no central bank, nation state or regulatory authority backing it up.</p> <p>The coins themselves are made by computers solving a set of complex maths problems, and people who use their computers to make coins and record transactions are called miners.</p> <p>To spend it, users buy bitcoin and transact using exchanges such as San Francisco-based Coinbase. Rather than a central authority validating transactions, they are all recorded on a public ledger, called the blockchain.</p> <p>Bitcoin has a finite supply of 21m of which more than 15m are in circulation, which supporters claim make it more stable than government-backed currencies that can be devalued by central banks printing money. They say this means its value will only rise over time, with some claiming the price could top $10,000 a coin. Bitcoin first came to the attention of many people after it was used on the online black market site Silk Road, known as a platform for selling illegal drugs.</p> <p>\u201cThe coins are \u2018manufactured\u2019 using cryptography, which is spooky to most people. Bitcoin is also a reasonably anonymous way to carry out large cross-border money transfers, so has inevitably become linked to illegal goods and services,\u201d says Dave Hrycyszyn, of digital agency Head, which advises companies on new technologies.</p> <p>The lack of regulation appeals to some, but also means it has none of the stability mechanisms typically associated with a currency, which can make it volatile, he said.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>You can pay using a bitcoin wallet app, and can even get a bitcoin debit card</p> <footer> <cite>Obi Nwosu, Coinfloor</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <h2><strong>How do I buy it?</strong></h2> <p>Bitcoin is bought via online exchanges and platforms, with an increasing number of UK options. Fractions or \u201cbits\u201d can be bought instead of a whole bitcoin. Investment can start with as little as $10 on some sites. Bitcoin exchanges and brokers include <a href=\"https://coinfloor.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Coinfloor</a>, <a href=\"https://www.coincorner.com/\" title=\"\">CoinCorner</a> and <a href=\"https://quickbitcoin.co.uk/\" title=\"\">QuickBitcoin</a>. Transaction fees vary according to the exchange or broker, but typically range from 0.2%-1% of the currency bought, plus bank transaction charges. Fees of up to 1% can apply on sales.</p> <p>Bitcoin are stored in a \u201cdigital wallet\u201d, which can also manage transactions. It exists either in the cloud or on computers, and can be linked to bank accounts. If using an online wallet , investors must be sure they can trust the provider, because if hackers breach its server\u2019s security measures the bitcoin could be stolen.</p> <p>Typically, you can pay by bank transfer, mobile payments or with a Visa or Mastercard. There are also bitcoin ATMs, which allow for bitcoin to be exchanged for cash and vice versa, in London, Bristol, Brighton and Glasgow.</p> <h2><strong>What can you buy with it?</strong></h2> <p>A growing list of firms accept Bitcoin, including Tesla, Microsoft, CheapAir.com and Britain\u2019s first bitcoin pub, The Pembury Tavern in Hackney, London, where a pint of Milton Pegasus costs \u00a33.70 or 0.0084 bitcoin.</p> <p>Obi Nwosu, managing director of Coinfloor, says you can spend it wherever you see the \u201cbitcoin accepted here\u201d sign, either online or at local stores, with no transaction charges. \u201cYou can pay using a bitcoin wallet app, and can even get bitcoin debit cards that you can use anywhere that accepts Mastercard or Visa.\u201d</p> <p>You can also cash in your coins at any time and get real currency in return, for a small broker fee, he adds.</p> <h2><strong>Should I invest in it?</strong></h2> <p>Bitcoin has grown strongly but with plenty of volatility along the way. Over the past 12 months its price has risen from $220 to $575, according to figures from Coindesk \u2013 a return of 161%. It has also shown resilience, with the price rallying after the Bitfinex hack. Yet it remains well below its all-time spike of $979.45, which it hit on 25 November 2013. In short, this is not a safe haven: despite excitable claims the price could hit $10,000, where it goes next is anybody\u2019s guess, so investors should approach with caution.</p> <p>Lex Deak, chief executive of alternative investment aggregator Off3r, says investing in Bitcoin isn\u2019t for the fainthearted. \u201cYou should only invest a small proportion of your money and be prepared for massive swings in value.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/aug/03/bitcoin-stolen-bitfinex-exchange-hong-kong\">Bitcoin worth $78m stolen from Bitfinex exchange in Hong Kong</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The early gold rush days are over, he adds, and buyers shouldn\u2019t treat it as a get-rich-quick scheme. \u201cYou could double your money within a year, but you could easily lose it all,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Marc Warne, the founder of Bittylicious, a site where bitcoins can be bought, says novice investors should start modestly. \u201cJust buy a small amount to begin with, say \u00a330, to learn how it works, how to trade it, and how to handle it safely in a wallet,\u201d he says. He advises against investing large sums unless you really understand crypto currencies and computer security.</p> <p>As bitcoin has a finite supply, future price movement will depend on demand, Warne says. \u201cBitcoin will be used more in the future because it\u2019s the first time that something not fully controlled by any entity like a government or bank has been used over the internet. It has been around for about seven years now without any fundamental issues.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Is it safe?</strong></h2> <p>Bitcoin cannot be hacked, manipulated or altered, but exchanges or digital wallets are vulnerable, just like online bank accounts, Warne says. \u201cIf you hold bitcoin in any form you instantly become a target,\u201d he adds.</p> <p>Since bitcoin doesn\u2019t actually exist, what is stored in the wallet are the secure digital keys used to access specific details of the bitcoin. The private key is a secret code which allows the user to prove ownership of their bitcoin. Wallets can be installed on smartphones using an app or web-based wallets can be run by currency exchanges. Buyers need to make sure their computer\u2019s security is up to scratch, and must also trust the exchange, which needs high-level security to prevent hacking.</p> <p>James Hill, software developer at consultancy Scott Logic, says the core blockchain algorithm, which underpins all cryptocurrencies, remains secure. He says the real danger comes from losing the keys that prove buyers own their own coins.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/aug/07/bitfinex-exchange-customers-receive-36-percent-loss-tokens\">All Bitfinex clients to share 36% loss of assets following exchange hack</a> </p> </aside>  <p>If you are hacked, there is no way of claiming a refund from a bank or regulatory authority because none exists.</p> <h2><strong>Word of warning</strong></h2> <p>Hrycyszyn warns that, as with all technology, something better may one day come along. \u201cWhen that happens, bitcoin\u2019s value could collapse to near-zero, probably in a matter of hours or minutes, in a spectacular ball of flames. It has no support structure to prop it up, like a normal currency does. Do not treat this as a long-term store of value to fund your retirement.\u201d</p> <p>Damien Fahy, founder of website MoneytotheMasses, says it will remain a fringe investment until it is officially recognised and regulated. \u201cOrdinary currency investing is risky enough, but bitcoin is even riskier.\u201d</p> <h2>BUYING AND SELLING</h2> <p>\u25a0 <strong>Step 1</strong> Set up a bitcoin wallet. You need somewhere to store the private keys that allow you to spend or exchange bitcoin. Security is vital, so check how your money is protected \u2013 otherwise you could lose all of it. Otherwise, this is similar to opening an ordinary bank account.</p> <p>\u25a0 <strong>Step 2</strong> Get your bitcoin address. Once you have signed up and accepted the user&#xa0;agreement you will get a bitcoin address, a unique identifier of 26-35 numbers and letters, beginning with the number 1 or 3, which is the destination for a bitcoin payment.</p> <p>\u25a0 <strong>Step 3</strong> Buy bitcoin. You can make your purchase through your wallet or a range of brokers and platforms. These are digital rather than physical coins. Input your bitcoin address, the amount of money you want to convert, how you plan to pay, and so on. You typically have to pay a fee of between 0.2% and 1%, depending on the site, plus a small bank transfer fee.</p> <p>\u25a0 <strong>Step 4</strong> Make a payment. Once you have bitcoin in your account you can start making payments. You will need the bitcoin address of the recipient.</p> <p>\u25a0 <strong>Step 5</strong> Sell bitcoin. If you want to cash in your bitcoin, or bank a profit, selling is pretty straightforward. You can register to sell direct on sites through an online exchange or platforms such as Coinbase, Coinfloor, BitBargain or Bittylicious. Again, there are transaction fees up to about 1% of your trade.</p>",
  "<p><strong>My daughter had her credit card swallowed by a cash machine on 13 July in Peru while travelling around South America. I arranged for a company called Parcel Monkey to deliver a replacement card to a hostel where she could be for five days to give them (I thought) a big window for delivery. It quoted a delivery time of four to five days. The parcel was collected from us on Tuesday 26 July but it then estimated a delivery time of 15 days (which took us into August by which stage my daughter was long gone).</strong></p> <p><strong>I believe that I have been misled with a service that the company must have known it was unable to deliver. It told me that this was because the delivery was to a remote area. I am trying to have it delivered to Sucre, which is the capital of Bolivia \u2013 it can hardly be called a remote area. </strong><em>CJ</em><strong>, </strong><em>Cirencester, Gloucestershire</em></p> <p>According to its website, Parcel Monkey was set up in 2009 with \u201cthe dream of bringing cheap parcel delivery to the masses\u201d, claiming now to be well-established in the UK. But it is an agency, meaning that its business model involves sub-contracting out to local courier companies (which customers are invited to choose) over which it has no direct control, while delays with customs can extend predicted deadlines. We wondered why you had not asked your daughter\u2019s card issuer (Santander) to forward it to her. But apparently when she reported the card lost it suggested she go to a local branch \u2013 and there are not many in Peru. She also asked if they could post it to her out there but they said it could only be sent to the address registered to the card.</p> <p>We tested the Parcel Monkey site and it did indeed give us a four- to six-day quote for sending a package to Bolivia, so we asked it to explain what had happened. It said in a statement: \u201cThe item was held by Bolivian customs and as they could not trace the recipient [CJ\u2019s daughter] direct, CJ had provided the contact number of the hostel her daughter was staying in and not a direct line number, which created the communication delay with customs officials.\u201d</p> <p>As a gesture of goodwill the company has refunded the cost of your order (\u00a330.25). The lesson from this is to always take an additional card or payment method on extensive travels (and maybe not rely on your mum to sort out your problems). We also think the company should not be specifying delivery time frames that are ambitious, to say the least. It did point out that tracking services are provided to customers to monitor the movement of items, but this isn\u2019t always helpful when people are travelling on this sort of scale.</p> <p><strong>We welcome letters but cannot answer individually.

  "<p>In the cavernous assembly hall at Victor public school in the Delhi suburb of Shahdara, hundreds of pupils sit cross-legged on the floor to watch a story about seven-year-old Komal.</p> <p>Komal\u2019s parents become friendly with a new neighbour. He treats her affectionately and her parents tell her to call him Bakshi Uncle. He gives her sweets. He plays hide-and-seek with her.

Encouraged by the overwhelming response, Delhi police extended the programme to all schools in the capital.</p> <p>\u201cFor the first time, children have a non-frightening way of reporting abuse in the familiar environment of school,\u201d says Mukesh Kumari, one of the police officers visiting Victor public school.</p> <p>Many of the children tell her that they thought adults would punish them if they talked about such \u201cshameful\u201d things. \u201cEven I felt uneasy at first. It\u2019s just not something we Indians talk about,\u201d says Kumari.</p> <p>During the session, many pupils look embarrassed. \u201cIn our house we don\u2019t talk about such things. My father would slap me if I talked about this,\u201d says 12-year-old Neelam Sharma.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/jul/08/india-dalit-how-can-a-girl-become-a-taxi-driver-defying-caste-gender-taboos\">'How can a girl become a taxi driver?': defying India's caste and gender taboos</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But others were less timid. Two girls speak to Kumari and her colleague, Preeti Tomar, to complain about rowdy youths standing outside the school gates as they leave, directing obscenities at them. Another says she doesn\u2019t like the way the auto-rickshaw driver who drives her home insists she sit close to him even when there is space on the back seat. </p> <p>Across the city, one or two female police officers visit a school every week, wearing a Nirbheek armband. The police have so far interacted with more than 1 million children and installed complaint boxes in more than 1,500 schools.</p> <p>Stalking, lewd comments by shopkeepers, inappropriate behaviour by auto-rickshaw drivers, and youths loitering outside the school propositioning girls are common complaints. </p> <p>In many cases, it is relatively easy for the police to take prompt action against the lesser forms of harassment. If it\u2019s a stalker, a visit to his home to speak to his family usually works. An auto-rickshaw driver can be warned. If it\u2019s a teacher, the school authorities act to discipline, suspend or sack him. The more serious cases require a police investigation. The police have filed formal charges in 11 cases of sexual abuse so far in the north-east district alone.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.childlineindia.org.in/pdf/MWCD-Child-Abuse-Report.pdf\">only statistics on child sex abuse</a> (pdf) in India are from a 2007 government survey that showed half of children under the age of 18 had suffered some form of sex abuse, ranging from rape to fondling and forced kissing.</p> <p>\u201cI think the 2007 figure is an eye-opener and the actual problem may be much larger,\u201d Bansal says. \u201cFrom what I see, a very large number of girls face abuse at some stage in their lives. It\u2019s grim. It happens under everyone\u2019s nose. How can we let our girls, one-quarter of our population, be damaged for life by sexual abuse?\u201d</p> <p>Bansal enlisted the support of the <a href=\"http://www.rahifoundation.org/\">Recovery and Healing from Incest Foundation (Rahi)</a>, an NGO that works with child abuse survivors to train police officers. About 500 have been trained so far.<br></p> <p>\u201cIt has to be handled sensitively because the social and family dynamics can be so complex. They need to understand these aspects because it will shape their response. It\u2019s great that the police are not waiting for cases to be registered but are being proactive,\u201d says Rahi\u2019s founder, Anuja Gupta. </p> <p>Tomar admits to being deeply distressed hearing some complaints. \u201cA father had been raping his daughter for years. When she told her mother, the mother said, \u2018Just the way I\u2019ve tolerated these things, you will have to tolerate it too.\u2019 After the girl reported the abuse through the dropbox, the mother tried to force her to withdraw it but the girl refused,\u201d she says.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/jul/06/why-is-the-crisis-in-rural-india-passing-under-the-radar\">Why is the rape crisis in rural India passing under the radar? | Priya Virmani</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In another case, says Bansal, a maths teacher had been assaulting girls for many years, touching them inappropriately when alone in the classroom. After two girls put a complaint in the dropbox, the other teachers sided with him and tried to bully the girls into retracting the allegation. But the police contacted ex-pupils who said they would testify against the teacher even if the two girls retracted their statements. The teacher is in police custody.</p> <p>The success of Nirbheek in Delhi has come to the attention of Maneka Gandhi, minister for women and child development, and plans are being made to roll it out nationally <a href=\"http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Soon-an-e-dropbox-for-kids-to-report-abuse/articleshow/52931133.cms\">using e-dropboxes</a>, which will be hosted on the <a href=\"http://ncpcr.gov.in/\">National Commission for Protection of Child Rights website</a>. </p> <p>Critics, though, say it\u2019s not the police\u2019s job to talk about sex abuse, and <a href=\"http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Sex-education-in-schools-should-be-banned-Union-health-minister-Harsh-Vardhan-says/articleshow/37274947.cms\">argue for sex education in schools</a>. </p> <p>Sex education is banned in 13 states and non-existent in the remaining 16.

If repeated, the concerning behaviour would perpetrate harm to other children. There has not been provided evidence of significant and sustained positive changes since the behaviour occurred.

  "<p>It is not a secret that the offshore detention on Nauru and Manus Island of asylum seekers trying to reach Australia by boat is inhumane.

The leaked incident reports document assaults, sexual abuse and self-harm attempts mostly among the most vulnerable: children. They are a stain on Australia\u2019s conscience and its international reputation. Yet the federal government is unrepentant. The phobia that Australia might be overrun by \u201cboat people\u201d seemingly trumps everything else. Anything is acceptable, it seems, to stop the boats.</p> <p>But it isn\u2019t. Throwing desperate people fleeing death and persecution in prison on small Pacific islands for having the temerity to seek refuge in Australia isn\u2019t just morally wrong, it\u2019s irrational, illegal and prohibitively expensive to boot. It must stop.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/21/offshore-detention-still-has-support-after-nauru-files-says-coalition-minister\">Offshore detention still has support after Nauru files, says Coalition minister</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Australia is a wonderfully diverse country that is generally welcoming to foreigners. The arrival of some 200,000 immigrants a year is relatively uncontroversial; 28.5% of the population was born abroad. But that generally open attitude makes the paranoia about the perceived threat posed by relatively small numbers of boat people seem all the more irrational. Unauthorised arrivals by boat totalled fewer than 70,000 people between 1990 and 2013. That is a drop in the ocean for a country of 24 million people. Australia is not in danger of being \u201cswamped\u201d.</p> <p>While the number of people detained offshore is relatively <a href=\"http://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_Departments/Parliamentary_Library/pubs/rp/rp1516/Quick_Guides/Offshore#_Total_number_of\">small</a> and had fallen to some 1,300 at the end of June, the cost of locking them up is large. Each person detained offshore in terrible conditions costs Australian taxpayers an eye-watering A$430,000 a year each, <a href=\"http://www.ncoa.gov.au/report/appendix-vol-2/10-14-illegal-maritime-arrival-costs.html\">according</a> to the National Commission of Audit. Just think how much those people could contribute to Australian society if only a small fraction of that amount was instead spent on welcoming them and getting them into work.</p> <p>The evidence is clear. The Australian government allocated A$27.8m in fiscal year 2014-15 to support 2,750 \u201cauthorised onshore arrivals\u201d (people who arrive in Australia with a visa and then seek asylum), amounting to A$10,100 per person. That much smaller fiscal outlay is repaid many times over as refugees start working and contributing to society, as many economic <a href=\"http://apo.org.au/files/Resource/mda_assessing-economic-contribution-refugees-australia_2013.pdf\">studies</a> show.</p> <p>Indeed, investing one dollar in helping refugees can yield nearly two dollars in economic benefits within five years, according to my own recent <a href=\"http://www.opennetwork.net/refugeeswork/\">study</a>, published by Open, the international think-tank that I founded, and the Tent Foundation, whose mission is to help forcibly displaced people. So even from a heartless, self-interested economic point of view, it is perverse to be locking up at prohibitive expense people who have a lot to contribute to Australia.</p> <p>There is also the small matter of international law. Earlier this year the high court <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/feb/03/high-court-upholds-australias-right-to-detain-asylum-seekers-offshore\">ruled</a> that offshore detention was lawful under Australia\u2019s constitution. But Australia is also a party to the 1967 Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees, an international treaty that extends the protections of the 1951 Refugee Convention to non-Europeans.</p> <p>The convention states that asylum seekers should not be penalised for their unauthorised entry to a country, provided they present themselves to the authorities without delay and show good cause for their unauthorised entry. Article 31.2 stipulates that receiving states \u201cshall not apply to the movements of such refugees restrictions other than those which are necessary and such restrictions shall only be applied until their status in the country is regularised or they obtain admission into another country.\u201d</p> <p>Lawyers can, of course, debate to what extent Australia\u2019s restrictions are \u201cnecessary\u201d. But however you interpret the convention, it certainly does not permit indefinite detention in inhumane conditions with no possibility for those with legitimate asylum claims to gain refugee status in Australia.</p> <p>Economics and the law are both important. But the overriding argument is a moral one. It cannot be right to inflict such suffering on people who have committed no crime, the vast <a href=\"http://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_Departments/Parliamentary_Library/pubs/rp/rp1516/Quick_Guides/Offshore#_Total_number_of\">majority</a> of whom are later found to be refugees.</p> <p>The federal government\u2019s argument that locking people up saves lives by deterring others from coming is bogus. If the government was really concerned about asylum seekers\u2019 welfare, it wouldn\u2019t treat them so badly. And yes, people smugglers are often nasty people. But that doesn\u2019t make punishing innocent asylum seekers acceptable.</p> <p>The government of Papua New Guinea has just decided to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/17/manus-island-detention-centre-to-close-australia-and-papua-new-guinea-agree\">shut the detention centre on Manus Island</a>.

  "<p>In a country that loves its <a href=\"http://www.destinyconnect.com/2015/07/16/reality-shows-hit-sa-tv-audiences/0\"> reality shows</a>, a very public competition is attracting record audiences. It does not involve a wedding or a singing child; there is no dancing and no mascara. There is, however, a celebrity: Thuli Madonsela.</p> <p>Appointed as South Africa\u2019s constitutionally mandated public ombudsman \u2013 officially known as the public protector \u2013 in 2009, Madonsela has become one of the country\u2019s best loved and most admired figures. But her seven-year non-renewable term will expire within weeks, and the South African parliament will choose her replacement next week. The search for candidates has gripped the nation.</p> <p>Parliamentary hearings have received blanket coverage. Supposed revelations about those hoping to replace Madonsela have made front pages. \u201cWho will protect us?\u201d ran one headline in the Sunday Times newspaper.</p> <p>Established at the end of the apartheid era by South Africa\u2019s new constitution, the role of public protector carries extensive powers to hold politicians, officials and others to account on behalf of the weak, poor, ignorant or simply angry.</p> <p>Political analysts in South Africa, where elected and unelected officials are routinely accused of corruption and other abuses, say the appointment is one of the most important decisions that MPs make.</p> <p>\u201cThe stakes are really very high.

She has received dozens of awards from around the world.</p> <p>So softly spoken that at press conferences reporters crowd the front-row seats to better hear her, Madonsela has shown extraordinary, some say foolhardy, commitment to her brief to investigate government misconduct.</p> <p>Her highest-profile investigation was into state expenditure on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/29/jacob-zuma-accused-corruption-south-africa\">President Jacob Zuma\u2019s home</a>. Under immense pressure from the ruling African National Congress (ANC) and the government, Madonsela found that public funds had been misused. She read her entire 448-page report aloud in a televised press conference, and her conclusions sparked a constitutional crisis, pitting her office against that of the president. She won.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6eac884b9a67c9da21d69ee96bc98b9a3665b31c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6eac884b9a67c9da21d69ee96bc98b9a3665b31c/0_196_2775_1665/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jacob Zuma\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jacob Zuma.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Macdougall/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There has been abuse \u2013 one ANC official accused Madonsela of being a US spy \u2013 and even death threats.

It was oddballs,\u201d she said in an interview with the Guardian this summer.</p> <p>One recent inquiry focuses on allegations of improper relations between the president and the Gupta family, who are among South Africa\u2019s wealthiest businessmen. Both Zuma and the Guptas deny any wrongdoing or impropriety. </p> <p>Such highly sensitive ongoing investigations explain some of the intense interest in the post among South Africa\u2019s political elite \u2013 and among a public that, as demonstrated in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/04/south-africans-deliver-stinging-rebuke-to-anc\">municipal elections this month</a>, increasingly views the ANC as corrupt and incompetent. The new office holder cannot simply close the inquiry, but can soft-pedal it.</p> <p>\u201cWe have seen it repeatedly over the years. It\u2019s very easy to undermine an investigation,\u201d said Evans. </p> <p>Many have wondered at the source of Madonsela\u2019s steely determination. She grew up in a small home without water or electricity in the Johannesburg township of Soweto during some of the darkest days of apartheid, sleeping on the floor of the family\u2019s tiny kitchen with six siblings. </p> <p>She won bursaries to fund her schooling and defied her father to study law at a top university. In 1994 she turned down a scholarship at Harvard to help draft South Africa\u2019s new constitution, which is admired around the world for its liberal principles. She then worked in the justice department, before setting up her own legal firm specialising in human rights, gender and constitutional law.</p> <p>Madonsela remembers how Zuma told her to \u201cshow no fear or favour\u201d when she was appointed, and described to her how previous public protectors had helped him before he became president. </p> <p>She resigned her longstanding ANC membership to avoid any conflicts of interest, and found a friend who was chair of the electoral commission \u201cguilty of gross maladministration\u201d. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/06/anc-elections-south-africa-democracy-zuma\">South Africa has broken the post-colonial narrative.

Zuma initially refused Madonsela\u2019s recommendation that he pay back part of the cash, but later agreed to do so. </p> <p>Madonsela, 53, who heads a team of more than 400, said the highlights of her term had been the hundreds of cases that never made it into the mainstream media. </p> <p>\u201cIt has been the men or women who have no means to hire a lawyer, who we can enable through our ability \u2026 to speak as an equal to those with power and [so] obtain a measure of justice,\u201d she said in the interview.</p> <p>Typical, she said, was an old man who had not been paid by local government officials and had lost his business and home as a result. \u201cThe average office holder works with me and my team with the utmost respect and co-operation. The politics have been dreadful but an aberration not the norm.\u201d </p> <p>The raised profile of the office will bolster its independence in the future, campaigners say. An obviously partisan political choice would cause a public outcry, and potentially a legal challenge.</p> <p>\u201cThuli set a very high bar \u2026 so the whole process is being scrutinised very closely,\u201d said David Lewis, of the Johannesburg-based campaign group Corruption Watch. </p> <p>Madonesela can now look forward to a quieter life. \u201cI will take a sabbatical and I will be writing and studying. Then I\u2019ll go back to my legal practice and being an activist in civil society for constitutionalism, rule of law and social justice,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cIt has been more rewarding than tiring. We receive more than our fair share of criticism and harassment but equally much support and more than our fair share of praise. Above all, we can see the difference we make.\u201d</p>",
  "<p> Two months ago on Tuesday, Britain voted to leave the European Union. The shock was immense; the fallout dramatic. But then summer came. The early turbulence subsided and normality (more or less) returned.</p> <p>Brexit, though, has not yet begun to happen. </p> <p>The government does not know what it wants and is not yet equipped to ask for it. Britain and the EU, it is increasingly clear, are far more intimately enmeshed than the leave camp had claimed. For all the leavers\u2019 assurances, extricating the UK from the bloc, negotiating new relationships with Europe and the rest of the world \u2013 and ensuring that Britain\u2019s laws and practices adapt \u2013 is a gargantuan undertaking. </p> <p>The referendum result, however, is a political reality.

The key elements to producing that work are (loosely) committing to the process, gathering the resources, setting to the task while accepting that a series of mistakes will be made during the creative process, acknowledging that there will be discomfort and hard emotional realisations in correcting, and more importantly, learning from those events will occur that will forever alter the attitudinal framework and mindset of the artist at hand. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/18/my-art-is-a-personal-antidote-for-the-effects-of-colonisation\">My art is a personal antidote for the effects of colonisation | Katie West for @IndigenousX</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The decision making process alone teaches patience, resilience, attention to micro and macro detail, consequential responsibility for decisions made and put into practise as well as the reality of realised self expression, possibly for the first time.<br>  These tasks activate parts of the mind, intellect, social and emotional being that may otherwise lay dormant and unexpressed. Both sides of the brain are required to function and it has been proven time and again that self actuated desire to numeracy and literacy competence are a natural consequence of exposure to the pursuit of producing art. It\u2019s worth noting that around or over 80% of people in prison have literacy and/or numeracy challenges. In most cases this deficit has contributed to the circumstance of their offending behaviour.  The key element is educational empathic engagement.   If this holds water, perhaps suggesting that art programmes in prisons would be of benefit to prisoners is not too much of a stretch. Further to that then, perhaps pointing out that everybody inside prisons are directly affected by the climate and culture inside prisons, it might not be too much of a stretch to suggest that the staff of prisons would also stand to benefit from the effects of working with a population that is actively engaged in serving their time rather than dealing with the unrelenting boredom of current incarceration practise. </p> <p>Practising art is perfect for the emotional and intellectual wellbeing of those with nothing but time to kill because it is something that is never fully learnt. The results would be tangible and far reaching within and external to the prisons. The return on investment would be present in terms of decreased sick leave, stress leave, etc. quite rapidly.</p> <p> Of course, not everybody\u2019s an artist \u2013 that\u2019s so true \u2013 however pretty much everyone benefits from exposure to positive self expression, particularly when the content is driven by harsh, often destructive, unexpressed emotion, often born of historic trauma. <br>  Avenues for opportunistic, therapeutic intervention through art therapy practices naturally present themselves in creative environments as alluded to above and have been proven successful.   It is said that the hardest part of producing any painting is applying paint to the canvas. Once this step is taken the rest pretty much looks after itself. I\u2019d like to see that principal put into practice with those who could most benefit themselves and broader society, by the institutions charged with correcting offending behaviour. It\u2019s doable. It just needs doing. Because at the moment, with very few exceptions, it is not being done. We as a society pay for the results dearly.   The choice simply is this; what product do we want our correctional centres to produce? Do we want the to produce people who have learned from their mistakes and have bettered themselves? Or do we want them to produce people are released back into the world, profoundly damaged by the experience of punishment, deprivation of liberty, humanity and dignity by being purely punished by being locked up.   In Queensland, prisoners are not allowed to make any money from sales of work produced whilst incarcerated. The situation is born of legislation introduced early this decade. There seems to be no purpose served by the legislation. While it is in place it makes an already difficult situation much more challenging. The prisons are naturally, lawfully obliged to adhere to the existing legislation, regardless of its veracity, or lack thereof.   What happens inside the walls of our prisons is a very concentrated, intense version of the society of the day, which is perhaps an interesting, if unpalatable commentary on contemporary Australian society. It could even beg the question, how far has mainstream Australia, as a society progressed beyond it\u2019s prison colony beginnings.</p> <p>As a member of the Brisbane Council of Elders, I visit our brothers and sisters in all the prisons from Maryborough south to the Queensland/New South Wales border, as well as visiting our young ones in the Queensland Juvenile Detention Centre. </p> <p>In one particular prison, our visits go beyond the contact and non-contact visit areas where family and legal representative visits are conducted. We are deep within whichever complex our schedule throws up, and when we visit we are surrounded by what the outside world would call hardened criminals. Sometimes we will not have guards around us, save for the occasional cultural liaison officer during our visit and will never feel anything other than completely safe and comfortable. </p> <p>We will be in the company of around 40 inmates and I will watch Aunties melt young men with a few words and Uncles have a series of warm, demonstratively affectionate greetings that inevitably leads to a series of yarns that last the duration of our four hours inside. We will be regularly asked if we\u2019d like coffee, tea, cold water and biscuits brought to us where we sit, always with care and beautiful manners.</p> <p> The description of what we experience is perhaps a counterintuitive scenario to what you the reader may expect to read. This particular facility, even though it\u2019s as overcrowded as the rest, has a well supported, well resourced, well accessed arts centre and education centre. This is not the case everywhere, and it is incredibly noticeable in the demeanour of the inmates and staff alike. <br>  It\u2019s my intention to see the conditions of this prison as the rule rather than the exception. I\u2019m hoping, after reading this, it might become a consideration of yours too.<br></p> <p><em>\u201cOur stories, our way\u201d \u2013 each week, a new guest hosts the </em><em>@IndigenousX Twitter account</em><em> </em><em>to discuss topics of interest to them as Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander people.

It hasn\u2019t been done by friends of equality.\u201d</p> <p>Kirby said Australia didn\u2019t hold a plebiscite when dismantling the white Australia policy, advancing women\u2019s equality, or the equality of people with a disability. \u201cWhy are we now picking out the LGBT, the gay community?
