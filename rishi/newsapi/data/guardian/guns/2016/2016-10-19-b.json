When asked: \u2018What do you think is the biggest threat to job security in Australia?\u2019 in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/21/progressives-can-attract-hanson-supporters-but-not-by-insulting-them\">an Essential poll last month</a>, 18% of those surveyed said it was the impact of technological change, while 31% said there was more to fear from free-trade deals that allow foreign workers into the labour market.</p> <p>Combined, it means almost half<em> </em>of Australians fear technology or foreigners are a threat to their jobs. This leads to some fundamental questions about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/series/fourth-industrial-revolution\">the impact the fourth industrial revolution</a> is going to have on migration and refugees. If jobs now routinely done by migrants (such as cleaning, fast food and other low-skilled, low-paid work) are increasingly automated, does it mean countries take fewer migrants? Does it mean they will only want well-educated migrants?<em> </em>And does this have implications for how refugees are valued by the wider community?<em> </em></p> <p>Pamela Curr, of the Asylum Seekers Resource Centre, says refugees have often filled jobs in rural areas. \u201cMost particularly during the mining boom, young Australian men would much rather go to the mines where they could earn $100,000 a year plus, than go out and work in the agricultural field. So for instance, in meat processing, chicken processing and a lot of the heavy agricultural work in isolated locations, they were desperate for workers,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Curr says Hazaras, who mainly come from central Afghanistan and have a background in agriculture, regularly filled regional jobs, often in very isolated locations, after coming out of immigration detention in Australia.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/oct/14/why-teaching-graduates-to-be-flexible-is-more-important-than-worrying-about-jobs-that-dont-yet-exist\">Why teaching graduates to be flexible is more important than worrying about jobs that don't yet exist</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But those isolated locations have just become a little less isolated. As of 29 September, farmers are allowed to fly 25kg drones over their property without an unmanned aircraft operator\u2019s certificate. \u201cThat\u2019s a drone that can take a pretty good payload, could carry a fair bit of chemical around for crop-spraying, [and] could easily carry cameras and other gear to do visual inspections,\u201d said <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-04-01/new-drone-regulations-to-benefit-farmers/7293392\" rel=\"nofollow\">Peter Gibson of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority</a>. </p> <p>Not every job taken over by drones will be one previously done by a migrant, of course, and Sydney-based migration agent John McQuaid says Australia is <a href=\"http://migrationblog.border.gov.au/2016/09/12/new-entrepreneur-visa-and-changes-to-the-points-test/\" rel=\"nofollow\">looking at technology and innovation as a positive</a>. \u201cThe government looks at what ideas can be turned into employment opportunities for Australians. What they are seeing is that the innovations area [such as new business startups, entrepreneurs and research] is providing jobs at a rate four or five times above almost any other start-up type businesses,\u201d he said. </p> <p>The federal government\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.innovation.gov.au/\" rel=\"nofollow\">National Innovation and Science Agenda</a> website says it \u201cis helping innovators to get funding to back their ideas and have a go\u201d.

Not all of this can be controlled by government. If people want to migrate, they figure out ways to migrate. They\u2019ll work through the channels that exist, and if they can\u2019t then they\u2019ll work through illegal channels to migrate.\u201d</p> <p>Jiyoung Song, director of migration and border policy at the Lowy Institute, says economic migrants normally fill gaps in the labour market, rather than replace people. \u201cThere will still be the need of skilled migrants who will work across different national boundaries. The future of work is already having an impact on our lives.\u201d She says advances in technology means national borders are increasingly no barrier to jobs \u2013 for instance, there is no reason a computer coder in India can\u2019t do work for companies in Australia, the US or anywhere.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/sep/26/with-robots-is-a-life-without-work-one-wed-want-to-live\">With robots, is a life without work one we'd want to live?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>While well-educated migrants are very much in global demand, people with fewer skills will still also be needed, Song says. \u201cThose with the wanted knowledge and skill sets are likely to have greater mobility than those without. However, countries need both skilled and low-skilled migrants to fill the jobs the locals can\u2019t do or don\u2019t want to do, in other words, either the most cutting-edge jobs or the most unwanted jobs in domestic markets.\u201d</p> <p>She says advances in technology are unlikely to affect how refugees are valued. \u201cRefugees are accepted for humanitarian grounds, not economic demand ... However, in recent years <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/18/refugee-crisis-rests-on-obama-summit-un-talks-fail\">and at the UN summit [in September]</a>, legal and complementary pathways were suggested as alternative ways to protect the rights of refugees and asylum seekers.</p> <p>\u201cWhat this means is that governments are considering the option to offer various other ways to settle temporarily and permanently for refugees and asylum seekers who have skills they want. This is a progressive solution not many governments are buying into at the moment, but it is the only viable way to solve the current refugee crisis,\u201d said Song.</p> <p>Matching refugees\u2019 skills to jobs in their new country benefits both the individual and the host nation. In Berlin, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/may/18/syrian-refugees-jobs-berlin-technology-migranthire\">Syrian refugee and developer Hussein Shaker</a>, who struggled to find work using his IT skills due to his lack of German, co-founded MigrantHire. He soon found that tech companies in the city were so desperate for developers they didn\u2019t care whether employees could speak German. It was their knowledge of ones and zeroes that mattered most.</p> <p>Such innovation is happening locally too, with the Red Cross partnering with tech communities in Sydney and Melbourne for <a href=\"http://www.redcross.org.au/red-cross-partners-with-tech-community-for-refugee-hackathon.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">\u201cTechfugees hackathons\u201d</a> to find new ways that can help refugee families settle into Australian life. <a href=\"https://techfugees.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Techfugees</a> looks to address some of the issues faced by refugees and asylum seekers by connecting developers, designers, entrepreneurs and startups with non-profit and community organisations.</p> <p>Vicki Mau, manager of migration support programs at Red Cross, says the ideas that have come out of Techfugees, such as an app to help connect migrants with interpreters and another to help link individuals to friends, mentors, services and employment, have been very innovative. \u201cThese are great for Red Cross and invaluable for participants, such as refugees and asylum seekers looking for work and mentors,\u201d she said.</p>",
  "<p>Is Oscar Wilde about be posthumously pardoned? In a symbolic gesture announced by the government on Thursday, deceased gay and bisexual men convicted of sexual offences that are no longer illegal will have their criminal records wiped.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/feb/22/family-alan-turing-government-petition-pardons-gross-indecency-homosexuality\">Family of Alan Turing to demand government pardon 49,000 other men</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Announcing the initiative, the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) said that no individuals would be named or singled out \u2013 leaving the status of past scandals unresolved.</p> <p>If the historical homosexual crime is no longer illegal and involved a consensual act with someone over the age of 16, then those convicted will be deemed to have received a posthumous pardon. <br></p> <p>The complexity of the evidence that led to Wilde\u2019s conviction in 1895 for gross indecency \u2013 including evidence of procuring male prostitutes \u2013 would make it difficult to assess. The gay rights organisation Stonewall suggested that the playwright and author, who was sentenced to two years hard labour in Reading jail, should now be entitled to a pardon.<br></p> <p>The justice minister, Sam Gyimah, said that a clause would be introduced into the policing and crime bill. \u201cIt is hugely important that we pardon people convicted of historical sexual offences who would be innocent of any crime today,\u201d he said. \u201cThrough pardons and the existing disregard process we will meet our manifesto commitment to put right these wrongs.\u201d<br></p> <p>The disregard process is already open to those who are alive and wish to remove from their criminal record any past sexual offences that are no longer illegal. They will be entitled to a statutory pardon under the new legislation. </p> <p> In 2013 Alan Turing, the gay mathematician who broke the German Enigma codes, was posthumously pardoned by the Queen. He killed himself by taking cyanide in 1954, at the age of 41, following his conviction for gross indecency. </p> <p>The MoJ said it would partially follow <a href=\"https://lgbt.libdems.org.uk/en/article/2014/0877787/lord-sharkey-calls-for-convictions-for-homosexuality-to-be-post-humously-disregarded\">Lord Sharkey\u2019s amendment</a> to the Protection of Freedoms Act 2012 although it would grant a blanket pardon for those who have died and not investigate individual historical cases. </p> <p>Sharkey said: \u201cThis is a momentous day for thousands of families up and down the UK who have been campaigning on this issue for decades. I am very grateful for the government\u2019s support and the support of many of my colleagues in parliament.\u201d</p> <p>The government has declined to support a private members\u2019 bill on the subject, brought forward by an SNP MP, John Nicolson, which is due to be debated in parliament later this week. <br></p> <p>Ministers said they fear that bill would allow some people to claim they have been cleared of offences that are still crimes \u2013 including sex with a minor and non-consensual sexual activity.</p> <p>Gyimah said: \u201cI understand and support the intentions behind Mr Nicolson\u2019s bill, however I worry that he has not fully thought through the consequences. A blanket pardon, without the detailed investigations carried out by the Home Office under the disregard process, could see people guilty of an offence which is still a crime today claiming to be pardoned.\u201d <br></p> <p>The MoJ said there would be no historical limit in relation to past offences. It declined to say whether Wilde would be among those deemed posthumously pardoned.</p> <p>Nicolson, the former BBC newsreader and front bench SNP culture spokesman, told the Guardian that the former justice secretary Michael Gove had promised him government support for his private member\u2019s bill. His would only backdate pardons to 1919. \u201cI hope that the government will sit and read my bill carefully,\u201d he said. \u201cMine would also be a blanket pardon. A lot of those people [who are alive] are very old and would not want their names listed.\u201d</p> <p>Paul Twocock, director of campaigns at Stonewall, said: \u201cWe welcome the government announcement to issue a posthumous pardon to all gay and bi men unjustly prosecuted for being who they are, but we don\u2019t think it goes far enough. John Nicolson MP\u2019s proposed bill closes a loophole that means some gay and bi men who are still alive and living with those convictions still can\u2019t have them deleted, despite them being unjust and not illegal today. We urge the government to look at bringing this into their proposal.</p> <p> \u201cWe also don\u2019t agree with the government\u2019s interpretation of John Nicolson MP\u2019s bill \u2013 it explicitly excludes pardoning anyone convicted of offences that would still be illegal today, including non-consensual sex and sex with someone under 16.\u201d</p> <p><strong><br></strong><strong><br></strong></p>",
  "<p>For years, journalists have treated American gun violence as an hopeless problem. They cover the latest mass shooting, they write about congressional inaction, and then they move on. </p> <p>We\u2019re not doing that.</p> <p>Early this year, the Guardian hired me as one of the country\u2019s only full-time gun politics reporters.

We\u2019re holding both Democrats and Republicans accountable for what they\u2019re doing to prevent gun violence and suicide.</p> <p>Last month, we published the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/19/us-gun-ownership-survey\">exclusive results</a> of the most definitive survey of gun ownership in two decades.

When the data sets we need to answer crucial questions don\u2019t exist, we build them. That\u2019s what we did with The Counted, our in-depth database of police killings. That\u2019s what we\u2019re now doing with gun murders in America. </p> <p>We\u2019ve already learned that there are powerful voices for gun violence prevention that simply aren\u2019t getting heard, and solutions that are getting lost in the swift cycles of tragedy, outrage and backlash. </p> <p>Help us keep our focus on how to fix this problem.

He said he wants to get to a position where the Pensions Protection Fund (PPF), the industry-wide rescue scheme, is not required.

A more useful figure in this context is net investment after depreciation: it was negative in 10 out of 14 years of ownership by the Green family, the select committee\u2019s report showed, quoting BHS accounts.</p> <p>Add it all up, and one suspects Green\u2019s plea for mercy will achieve little. It is odds-on that MPs will recommend that the knighthood be annulled, assuming the speaker allows a vote.</p> <p>Yet the attempt to put pressure on the honours forfeiture committee feels as if it has come too soon. Yes, Green is an unsympathetic character, his answers can be slippery and his attempts to shift blame onto his advisers are irritating. Yes, the sale of BHS to a thrice bankrupt individual whose outfit was described as a \u201cshambles\u201d by the two select committees was legal but shocking \u2013 or, as Green now admits, a mistake. And, yes, the delay in \u201csorting\u201d the pension deficit, which is Green\u2019s declared ambition, has become tiresome. If he had acted firmly when he owned the business, the funding position might not have deteriorated so severely.</p> <p>Yet, at the end of the process with the Pensions Regulator, Green will be presented with a bill and be expected to pay. If he refuses, the knighthood should be removed \u2013 no question. But if he pays up, what are the grounds for degonging? Green, albeit after faffing around for ages, would have met the demands of a regulator that enjoys the support of parliament. It would be better if MPs set a deadline for Green to do the right thing for BHS pensioners and then returned to the question of the knighthood.</p> <h2>There\u2019s no need to kick the can any further down the runway</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"235d77c1c844542a33cbcf54da4c6ac72ae19025\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/235d77c1c844542a33cbcf54da4c6ac72ae19025/0_903_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Artist\u2019s impression of proposed Gatwick expansion by architect planner Sir Terry Farrell.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Artist\u2019s impression of proposed Gatwick expansion by architect planner Sir Terry Farrell.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gatwick Airport/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Change is coming, Theresa May told us many times a few weeks ago.

  "<p>There was no sign of Lionel Messi\u2019s mate. The first time he met Sergio Ag\u00fcero, they were teenagers, brought together in the Netherlands more than a decade ago. Sitting at a table in a dining room, Ag\u00fcero looked at the kid opposite him, no idea who he was. \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d he asked. The reply was delivered quietly: \u201cLionel.\u201d Lionel would become his room-mate and soon best friend; unknown he might have been but he would also become the best player in the world. Theirs was another of the many relationships renewed here: Claudio Bravo and Marc-Andr\u00e9 ter Stegen, Nolito and Luis Enrique, Pep Guardiola and all of them. Sergio Ag\u00fcero and Lionel Messi.</p> <p>Yet when Messi strolled out, he saw only one member of that Argentina Under-20 team: Pablo Zabaleta. Ag\u00fcero had been left out. His absence defined the way the game would be played; Messi\u2019s presence decided it. Tactically this was fascinating, contrasting styles within broadly shared philosophies, but talent transcended all \u2013 talent and mistakes: a slip, a red card, a ball given away. After this 4-0 defeat Guardiola\u2019s decisions will be debated fiercely.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/19/barcelona-manchester-city-champions-league-match-report-messi\">Messi hat-trick sends Barcelona waltzing past Manchester City</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The first time he came home, with Bayern Munich, Messi scored twice. This time it was three. He had got them all before Ag\u00fcero even appeared, with 11 minutes left, the game over. Soon afterwards a wonderful run drew the penalty which Neymar had saved by Willy Caballero. Neymar made up for it a moment later. Guardiola stood and watched, with much to chew over.</p> <p>The news had filtered through an hour or so before kick-off. Ag\u00fcero had been left out \u2013 the question was why. Was he injured? The Catalans had a different view: this was a very Pep thing to do. This, after all, is the manager who said his dream was to have 100% of the possession, a team made up entirely of midfielders. One of his most tactically emblematic games was the World Club Cup final in 2011: that day Barcelona hammered Santos 4-0 with a formation that was essentially 4-6-0 but no less attacking for it. Control was everything.</p> <p>\u201cMidfielders are intelligent players who have to think about the team as a whole: they\u2019re selfless players who understand the game better than anyone,\u201d Guardiola once said. Eventually it was confirmed. Talking to the television just before the game, he admitted the decision was tactical. Guardiola wanted as many men in the midfield as possible; a midfield that would be pushed high, seeking where possible to asphyxiate their opponents. That meant a front line of three with Nolito and Raheem Sterling on the wings, and Kevin De Bruyne in the middle.</p> <p>Nor was it just the striker, or lack thereof. When City had the ball, which was often, Zabaleta became a midfielder too \u2013 not pushed up, as full-backs regularly are, but pushed in, more Philipp Lahm than Dani Alves, positioning himself alongside Fernandinho so that the fluid formation looked, at times, like a 3-2-3-2 or even a 3-3-4. Together City pressed high. Maybe they had been encouraged by the way that Ter Stegen had given away two goals against Celta Vigo recently.</p> <p>That is another thing the clubs share: a debate around the goalkeeper playing the ball out but a determination for him to keep doing so. That argument will not subside, in Manchester at least, after Bravo was sent off, yet there was a message too in the way the Camp Nou chanted his name and applauded him from the field, grateful \u2013 and not just for the error. Barcelona were rewarded for pressuring there. City\u2019s plan involved pressing too, forcing Barcelona to play from deep, sometimes even to go longer.</p> <p>Forcing? Encouraging, perhaps? And that is the risk against this Barcelona, the tactical tweak that some believe makes them an even better side than they were before, Luis Enrique giving them a variety that Guardiola did not, winning a treble in his first season, like Pep, and a double in his second.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/19/manchester-city-pep-guardiola-barcelona-champions-league\">Pep Guardiola defends Bravo after red card leads to heavy Barcelona defeat</a> </p> </aside>  <p>His is a team adept at riding the first wave of pressure, playing short through it or long beyond it; it is also one that has embraced the counter-attack as never before. Neymar and Luis Su\u00e1rez allow them to do so to great effect and even Messi was turning the ball forward swiftly, and first time early on. More importantly, of course, he did what he does: he got his 14th, 15th and 16th goals in 15 games against English clubs, all three impeccably taken.</p> <p>Luis Enrique and Guardiola have shared a lot, the Barcelona manager said. Most of all they share an ideal. That, at least, was the message before this game. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine anything better,\u201d Luis Enrique had said. The suggestion was they would play in similar ways but they did not, not exactly. The suspicion was that Guardiola was more of a purist. Luis Enrique insisted possession would be fundamental but in its relative absence there might be incision. And there was.</p> <p>City had their share of the ball and their chances too \u2013 they had more shots than the home side until near the end, Ter Stegen making a couple of sharp saves \u2013 but they did not have Ag\u00fcero and Barcelona did have his mate.</p> <p>\u201cThe big difference between Barcelona and Manchester City has a name and a surname: Leo Messi,\u201d former Bar\u00e7a defender Ronald Koeman had warned.

  "<p>British Muslims are planning to set up their own programme to stop people becoming terrorists in a direct challenge to the government\u2019s controversial Prevent scheme, the Guardian has learned.</p> <p>The plans are being masterminded by the Muslim Council of Britain (MCB), representing 500 charities, schools and mosques, which plans to start the Muslim-run counter-radicalisation scheme next year.</p> <p> \u201cIn reflecting the wishes of a cross-section of British Muslim society, our affiliates have directed the MCB to explore a grassroots-led response to the challenge of terrorism. Real challenges exists, as we see with Muslim families broken up as a number of children, mothers and fathers leave to travel to Syria,\u201d the MCB said in a statement.</p> <p>The Home Office\u2019s Prevent scheme is run by the police and security officials. The new initiative, run by a network of community groups across Britain, could cause concern as it could take people away from the official programme. The number of referrals to Prevent reached a record 8,000 in the year to April 2016.</p> <p>Critics, many of whom are in the Muslim community, say Prevent has at its heart an ideological purity test meaning western foreign policy can not be criticised, and the government is only prepared to work with those who do not challenge it.</p> <p>Instead of trying to liberalise British Islam, the new scheme will focus solely on a message that violence can never be used. A source familiar with the plans said: \u201cIf we can get these voices more heard, they are anti-government and therefore more credible in saying do not turn to violence.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"877973e5ec573f9cb17e7d7cb566fa964584379a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/877973e5ec573f9cb17e7d7cb566fa964584379a/0_277_1498_898/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dal Babu said Prevent was a \u2018toxic brand\u2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dal Babu said Prevent was a \u2018toxic brand\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rebecca Naden/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Mosques will be the key point of contact, being at the heart of Muslim communities across Britain. People can also be referred directly to the new counter-radicalisation scheme.</p> <p>Some of those who will try to turn people away from violence may include conservative Islamic scholars who are considered by government to be extremists. These are people who may have illiberal views on homosexuality or women\u2019s equality.</p> <p>MI5 estimates that 3,000 people in Britain may pose a terrorist threat and that more than 850 have travelled to Isis-controlled territory in Syria and Iraq, some of whom may want to return to the UK as Isis suffers military reverses on the ground. Isis has replaced al-Qaida as the Islamist brand that attracts most people to violent jihad, counter-terrorism officials believe.</p> <p>The source involved in setting up the new scheme said its launch, probably next year, was a matter of \u201cwhen not if\u201d and added: \u201cThe approach of the government is wrong and ineffective and not engaging with local communities, and does not have community support.\u201d The aim is to \u201ctackle the \u2026 issue of Daesh [Isis] within our communities, which splits up families,\u201d and to be more transparent.</p> <p>The MCB version of Prevent will include panels of community leaders, former police officers and professionals from mental health and other agencies willing to support the scheme.</p> <p> It will face a dilemma about whether it would ever report people to police if, for instance, their behaviour broke terrorism laws. The official Prevent scheme aims to detect people before their actions turn criminal.<br></p> <p>Former Met police chief superintendent Dal Babu said disquiet about Prevent has spread among Muslim communities and also to wider society. He said Prevent was a \u201ctoxic brand\u201d and said: \u201cIt\u2019s not rocket science: go back to how we defeated the IRA. Just like when we were dealing with the IRA, we needed the confidence of Catholic communities.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/13/human-rights-group-condemns-prevent-anti-radicalisation-strategy\">Human rights group condemns Prevent anti-radicalisation strategy</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The MCB said: \u201cHaving Muslims pass through subjective and discriminatory counter-extremism litmus tests as a condition of engagement only re-enforces the terrorist narrative. </p> <p>\u201cThe Prevent strategy exacerbates this problem and it is quite clear that it does not currently have the support of many among Muslim communities across the UK, yet the threat of terrorism is real and severe.\u201d</p> <p>Prevent is a key plank of the government\u2019s counter-terrorism strategy. Supporters say it is no different to \u201csafeguarding\u201d activities that the authorities carry out to stop people falling into other serious crimes. Activities include mentoring, help with employment and, increasingly, help with mental-health vulnerabilities.</p> <p>Waqar Ahmed, head of Prevent for Birmingham city council, said the scheme had saved lives: \u201cAny strategy aimed at safeguarding and supporting vulnerable individuals from a range of harms is surely a concept we can all agree on. Prevent is about protecting people from exploitation and harming themselves and others.\u201d</p> <p>However, concerns about Prevent appear to be growing. A report released on Wednesday said Prevent was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/oct/19/uks-prevent-counter-radicalisation-policy-badly-flawed\">badly flawed</a>, potentially counterproductive and risked trampling on the basic rights of young Muslims. The Open Society Justice Initiative called for a major government rethink, particularly on its use in the education and health systems.</p> <p>The US-based NGO studied 17 cases in which individuals had apparently fallen foul of the Prevent programme, or had been referred to a sister programme, Channel, both of which are intended to prevent individuals from being drawn into terrorism.</p> <p>They included instances in which information was apparently gathered from Muslim primary-school pupils without their parents\u2019 consent, and a 17-year-old referred to the police by his college authorities because he had become more religious.</p> <p>David Anderson, the official reviewer of terrorism legislation, said earlier this month: \u201cThere is a strong feeling in Muslim communities that I visit that Prevent is, if not a spying programme, then at least a programme that is targeted on them.\u201d</p> <p>The government defended Prevent and said: \u201cPeople referred under Prevent are absolutely not considered or treated as criminals. The strategy is about spotting early signs that someone is vulnerable and providing support to make them more resilient to grooming by terrorist recruiters.\u201d </p>",

The young cast give it a good crack but cannot overpower the weight of contrivance.

  "<p>Arsenal\u2019s progress, at home and abroad, remains serene. It says everything about this thrashing of Ludogorets Razgrad that Ars\u00e8ne Wenger\u2019s side did not have to be at their upbeat best to inflict it on opponents whose defensive resistance started shakily and disintegrated entirely thereafter. A seventh successive victory in all competitions, completed by the first senior hat-trick of Mesut \u00d6zil\u2019s glittering career, always felt assured and has left them on the verge of the knockout phase. This team is irresistible.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/19/barcelona-manchester-city-champions-league-match-report-messi\">Messi hat-trick sends Barcelona waltzing past Manchester City</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Given the context of Ludogorets\u2019 pitiful fragility, as Wenger acknowledged, Arsenal could brush off the odd pang of anxiety endured by their own backline. There was no cause for concern when contending with marking as lax as this and, in Vladislav Stoyanov, a goalkeeper whose confidence was shattered from the outset. \u00d6zil made all three of his rewards appear simple when lesser mortals might have snatched at the opportunities. \u201cIt looks like he has the taste for goals,\u201d Wenger said. \u201cWe wanted him to be a provider and a scorer but, before, he only liked to provide. He\u2019s slowly moving towards that better balance.\u201d</p> <p>The more games he plays against defending this cataclysmic the faster that process will be accelerated. The Bulgarians, deflated at finding themselves trailing by two at the interval when they had actually created enough chances to lead, might as well have retired at the break, so pathetic was their second-half showing.</p> <p>It was the naivety of their approach, all high-line defending and obliging parting of the ways, which took the breath away. While the attacking verve offered by Wanderson, Jonathan Cafu, Virgil Misidjan and Marcelinho made the game seem a contest for a while \u2013 even that enterprise was undermined by profligacy and stifled by David Ospina\u2019s brilliance \u2013 Georgi Dermendzhiev\u2019s side never showed the solidity on which to prosper.</p> <p>In the end their lively pursuit of parity after Alexis S\u00e1nchez\u2019s deliciously chipped early opener felt like a distant memory. They had been swatted aside, dismissed by Arsenal\u2019s new-found self-belief and the scintillating attacking play which has so illuminated their domestic form of late. Theo Walcott is a player revived, his emphatically converted goal from \u00d6zil\u2019s pass here a seventh in six games for the club and arguably the key strike of the night given the way Ludogorets seemed to give up from then on in. Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, on his first start for a month, was integral to much of the home side\u2019s vibrant approach and belted the third goal in the opening exchange of the second period after Jos\u00e9 Luis Palomino\u2019s panicked prod from Kieran Gibbs\u2019s centre. Thereafter \u00d6zil took control.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ee1636201a8302dc6df0253a1a446e5d6ccd1ebb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ee1636201a8302dc6df0253a1a446e5d6ccd1ebb/132_125_2755_1653/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mesut \u00d6zil\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Arsenal\u2019s Mesut \u00d6zil scores the goal to bring up his hat-trick \u2013 his side\u2019s sixth in all on the night.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ben Stansall/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This was uncharted territory for a World Cup winner who had never managed to score three times in a senior game, though even his celebrations were rather sheepish given the lack of resistance he encountered en route to claiming the match ball. His first had stemmed from a Ludogorets opportunity, Laurent Koscielny diving in superbly to thwart Marcelinho in front of goal with Santi Cazorla then floating a pass from deep which cut out the visitors\u2019 entire ramshackle rearguard. \u00d6zil\u2019s first touch beyond Cosmin Moti was a thing of beauty, his finish slid gracefully beyond the hapless Stoyanov.</p> <p>The substitute Lucas P\u00e9rez would provide his other two, from left and right flanks, with the Bulgarians long since frazzled. Their centre-halves had been drawn to the Spaniard seven minutes from time, mystifyingly leaving \u00d6zil unnoticed and alone in the centre. The third was dispatched expertly on the volley, left-footed, at Stoyanov\u2019s near post.</p> <p>\u201cThe more goals we scored, the better we actually defended,\u201d offered Wenger, who had hauled off S\u00e1nchez before the end after the Chilean took a knock on his achilles tendon. \u201cLet\u2019s not be too quick on the verdict. We have a strong squad and a strong spirit but you have to take care of it and keep your feet on the ground.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2016/oct/19/arsenal-v-ludogorets-champions-league-live\">Arsenal v Ludogorets: Champions League \u2013 live!</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cWe have to credit David Ospina because in the first half he saved us twice with important saves. But we have a good balance at the moment in the team. Maybe our final ball is better, or our finishing is better, but for sure we are scoring more goals. We play a risky game, so it\u2019s important we take our chances. But at the moment confidence is high and we\u2019re maybe getting through dodgy periods with less psychological damage. Now let\u2019s continue to score goals and get these lapses of concentration from our game.\u201d</p> <p>Tougher tests than this lie ahead, even if this group is eventually claimed ahead of Paris Saint-Germain, and those flurries of defensive angst, when Shkodran Mustafi and Koscielny suddenly appeared vulnerable to balls slid in from deep, will need to be eradicated.</p> <p>There had been similar fragility against Swansea City at the weekend and sooner or later someone will punish them. But while Arsenal are this prolific as an attacking force the management can work on strengthening defensive cohesion on the quiet. This was a saunter.</p>",

It was pure torture for City and only a spectacular goalkeeping performance from Joe Hart \u2013 expect another big performance from him tonight! Ha! \u2013 kept the score respectable. A few months later, however, Guardiola stood on the touchline for the first time as a visiting manager and discovered what it is like to be on the end of Messi\u2019s magic, as the little Argentinian destroyed Bayern Munich with a brilliant double in Barcelona\u2019s one-sided Champions League semi-final victory. </p> <p>It\u2019s the players, stupid. That\u2019s been one of the theories ever since Guardiola left Barcelona, the criticism informed by his failure to reach a Champions League final during his three seasons with Bayern. Who is this guy without Messi, the critics wonder. A charlatan? A spoofer? A <em>fraud</em>? All reductive nonsense, of course. You only need to look at the impact he has had on City\u2019s style of play during his short time in England to see how good he is (or you could look at everything he won at Barcelona or Bayern).</p> <p>There is an inkling of a point here, mind you. If you were a club owner and were offered a choice of Luis Enrique or Pep Guardiola, it would be a no brainer, right? You\u2019d pick Sam Allardyce. So would I. But you can\u2019t have him, so it\u2019s Luis Enrique or Pep Guardiola. Go on. Think about it. You don\u2019t need long to think about it. You\u2019d pick Pep. You\u2019d ignore the fact that Luis Enrique\u2019s Barcelona thumped Pep Guardiola\u2019s Bayern Munich last year. Luis Enrique\u2019s Barcelona might thump Pep Guardiola\u2019s Manchester City tonight. You\u2019d still pick Pep tomorrow. </p> <p>Here\u2019s the dilemma for Guardiola, then. We\u2019re all expecting a great game tonight, given that Guardiola is unlikely to betray his beliefs and opt for containment, and an great game is likely to end with a Barcelona victory. City have Aguero, Silva and De Bruyne, all of them wonderful players, but Barcelona have Messi, Suarez and Neymar, era-defining players. Barcelona have Andres Iniesta. Both managers are promising an open, flowing, fun game. Guardiola is no deluded artist; he is not a man who will place style over substance. He wants to win \u2013 but it remains to be seen whether his managerial brilliance can overcome Messi\u2019s individual genius. It promises to be a fascinating duel.</p> <p><strong>Kick-off: </strong>7.45pm BST, 8.45pm in Barcelona.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/oct/19/manchester-city-pep-guardiola-champions-league-barcelona\">Pep Guardiola heads home for ultimate test of early Manchester City progress | Paul Wilson</a> </p> </aside>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2016/oct/19/pep-guardiola-denies-trying-to-sign-lionel-messi-to-manchester-city-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/5862k\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2819117\"            data-video-name=\"Pep Guardiola denies trying to sign Lionel Messi for Manchester City \u2013\u00a0video\"            data-video-provider=\"SNTV\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-580719b1e4b055209adaf09f\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/10/19/161019pepguardiolabarca_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/10/19/161019pepguardiolabarca.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/10/19/161019pepguardiolabarca_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2016/oct/19/pep-guardiola-denies-trying-to-sign-lionel-messi-to-manchester-city-video\">Pep Guardiola denies trying to sign Lionel Messi for Manchester City</a>.</figcaption> </figure>  </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-10-19T16:55:28.910Z\">at 5.55pm BST</time></p>  </div>",
  "<p>Roger Goodell, the NFL commissioner, remained defiant on Tuesday about the health of the league, despite a TV ratings slump that has seen viewership plunge 11% in the first six weeks of the season.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/oct/19/paper-1-microsoft-surface-0-patriots-head-coach-dumps-tablet-in-five-minute-rant\">Paper 1, Microsoft Surface 0: Patriots head coach dumps tablet in five-minute rant</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Goodell spoke at the NFL owners\u2019 meeting in Houston and seemed to acknowledge that ratings had been disappointing, before insisting: \u201cWe don\u2019t think we\u2019ve lost viewers.\u201d</p> <p>Sunday night\u2019s Colts-Texans game drew just 12.9 million viewers, a 38% drop from week six last year, making it it the least-watched Sunday Night Football game since 2011. Every live televised Sunday night game is down by comparison with last year, according to Nielsen, and Monday night\u2019s Jets-Cardinals game drew just 8.4 million viewers, a drop from last year\u2019s Giants-Eagles game the same week. </p> <p>The presidential debates, Colin Kaepernick\u2019s national anthem protest, <a href=\"https://theringer.com/the-nfl-has-an-age-problem-7068825845e4#.16n3ppixr\">a decline in quality of play</a>, and a string of unappealing match-ups have been mooted as reasons for people turning off, but Goodell was unable to pinpoint a single determining factor for the slump.</p> <p>Goodell said: \u201cI don\u2019t think there is a single reason for it. We look at all those factors. Everyone has theories. \u2026 we also know that two primetime games that saw our most dramatic decrease went straight up against two very significant debates.</p> <p>\u201cAnother one of our primetime games was on Thursday night on NFL Network, as opposed to a network broadcast, which will always get a lower rating. There are a lot of factors to be considered. We don\u2019t make excuses. We try to look at what\u2019s causing it and make changes.\u201d</p> <p>Goodell flat out disagreed with the suggestion that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/29/colin-kaepernick-national-anthem-protest-fundamentally-american\">the anthem protest</a>, which has seen numerous NFL players refuse to stand for the Star-Spangled Banner, was a factor in the league\u2019s declining viewership. \u201cWe don\u2019t think that\u2019s a factor and neither do our network partners,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Goodell continued: \u201cWe don\u2019t think we\u2019ve lost viewers. When you look at ratings, you have to look a little deeper than that. It\u2019s viewers, but also how long they\u2019re engaging for. A lot of times, people will leave a game for whatever reason.\u201d</p> <p>The commissioner also spoke on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/19/jerry-jones-oakland-raiders-relaction-las-vegas-nfl\">the Raiders\u2019 potential relocation to Las Vegas</a>, where momentum is building after Nevada governor Brian Sandoval signed into law a bill on Monday that clears another hurdle in the construction of a $1.9bn mega-stadium just off the strip.</p> <p>\u201cIt was informative, it was factual,\u201d Goodell said. \u201cThere\u2019s still a great deal of information that we need to gather with respect to the circumstances we see in Las Vegas in the opportunities and also the challenges. Those are the things we\u2019ll look at through the committee and report back to them maybe as early as December, but more likely later than that.\u201d</p> <p>But he cautioned against any decision being made soon. \u201cThere is still a great deal of information we have to gather,\u201d he said.</p>",
  "<p>Edward Snowden has waded into the simmering debate over Canada\u2019s controversial anti-terror law, saying that Justin Trudeau was reluctant to repeal the law out of a fear of appearing soft on terror. <br></p> <p>Speaking to an audience in Toronto on Tuesday, Snowden pointed to a campaign promise by the Canadian prime minister to amend the sweeping legislation, which <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/21/canada-anti-terror-lawsuit-bill-c51\">gives security forces heightened powers</a> to apprehend suspected terrorists and disrupt their activities. \u201cBut he\u2019s been in office a little while now and we haven\u2019t seen that actually come to pass,\u201d said Snowden, appearing at the SecTor cybersecurity conference via videolink from Russia.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Bill C-51 was introduced in early 2015 by the country\u2019s then Conservative government, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/13/canada-anti-terror-law-public-consultation-campaign\">spawning protests across the country as it became law.</a> Hundreds of thousands of Canadians, including legal scholars, civil liberties groups and pundits from across the political spectrum, spoke out against the law and its perceived attempt to <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/05/canada-anti-terror-law-despite-widespread-protest\">supplant the country\u2019s democracy with a creeping police state.</a></p> <p>Trudeau vowed to amend the \u201cproblematic elements\u201d of the law, rather than simply repeal the legislation, noted Snowden. \u201cBecause he\u2019s afraid of being politically attacked on the basis of being soft on terrorism, regardless of whether or not this law actually helps prevent any terrorist attacks,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is just the way the politics of fear work.\u201d</p> <p>Last month the Liberal government launched <a href=\"https://www.canada.ca/en/services/defence/nationalsecurity/consultation-national-security.html\">a wide-ranging consultation on national security</a>, meaning any potential changes to the law will probably be delayed until next year. The extra time will offer the government the opportunity to get it right, said Ralph Goodale, Canada\u2019s public safety minister, as he announced the consultation. \u201cA lot of people felt shut out, and we promised to give them the opportunity to be heard.\u201d </p> <p>On Tuesday, Snowden suggested what he described as the minimum changes needed to the law, such as the creation of a judicial body that would carry out a case-by-case review of every individual exercise of these powers. \u201cAnd this means those individuals working in those spy agencies know simply that as long as they follow the law, they\u2019ll be fine,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The law allows information on Canadians to be shared between more than a dozen federal institutions. \u201cAll the activities held in our private lives, our private records, are being used as a kind of currency to gain standing and status within this surveillance network,\u201d said Snowden. \u201cWe\u2019re being traded like baseball cards.\u201d </p> <p>Any sharing of information \u2013 by those within Canada and with foreign agencies \u2013 that doesn\u2019t result in a trial or charges should be disclosed to individuals once a particular time frame has lapsed, he said, allowing people to ensure their rights have not been violated in any way.</p> <p>Snowden also took aim at the law\u2019s vague and undefined language. \u201cA lot of what classifies as terrorism in the political context \u2013 individuals that the news calls terrorist \u2013 are really common criminals,\u201d said Snowden. \u201cBut they do not constitute the kind of super criminal threat that is represented by our terrorism legislation.\u201d</p> <p>He pointed to the obvious need for law enforcement to have the right tools to counter these threats. \u201cBut we do not want to sacrifice everything that makes our societies great,\u201d he said. \u201cWe do not want to reorder the boundaries of our rights for the convenience of law enforcement officials, if it\u2019s not truly necessary, if it means we lose everything that we\u2019re trying to defend.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>The American Civil Liberties Union is challenging a secret court to effectively turn its back on deciding the meaning of a broad swath of surveillance and cybersecurity laws without public disclosure.<br></p> <p>A motion the ACLU is filing on Wednesday before the controversial foreign intelligence surveillance (Fisa) court, a panel that operates in secret, argues that the first amendment requires the release of numerous classified decisions between 2001 and 2015 that have established a legal foundation for expanding the government\u2019s surveillance activities.</p> <p>Among the Fisa court opinions sought is an interpretation of the seminal Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 that many suspect will <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/oct/06/yahoo-email-surveillance-government-nsa-fisa\">shed light</a> on a reported Yahoo program to scan vast amounts of users\u2019 emails.</p> <p>Critics of the court, most prominently Oregon Democratic senator Ron Wyden, have said its classified rulings amount to a body of \u201c<a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/09/nsa-loophole-warrantless-searches-email-calls\">secret law</a>\u201d that discard congressionally enacted privacy restrictions. The court and its supporters in government rejoinder that the extraordinary sensitivity around US surveillance practices for national security objectives necessitate the secrecy. </p> <p>While the major post-Edward Snowden surveillance reform, the USA Freedom Act of 2015, requires the Fisa court to release its \u201cnovel\u201d interpretations of the law, it is less clear about mandating retroactive disclosure. The ACLU on Wednesday contended that the US cannot engage in a meaningful democratic debate about surveillance and cybersecurity without the release of many post-9/11 Fisa court decisions.</p> <p>\u201cThese rulings are necessary to inform the public about the scope of the government\u2019s surveillance powers today,\u201d the ACLU argues in its disclosure motion. </p> <p>After Snowden\u2019s disclosures, the civil liberties group has had some success in compelling the Fisa court to declassify its major decisions. In September 2013, under challenge from the ACLU, the Fisa court <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.aclu.org/news/fisa-court-orders-declassification-review-rulings-nsa-spying-response-aclu-request\">released</a> its interpretations that permitted the bulk collection of US phone records based on a section of the 2001 Patriot Act allowing the government to gather collect information \u201crelevant\u201d to a national security investigation. </p> <p>However, that acquiescence from the Fisa court came after the Guardian had already <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/06/nsa-phone-records-verizon-court-order\">revealed the existence of that program</a>, as well as an <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/27/nsa-data-mining-authorised-obama\">internal National Security Agency history</a> of post-9/11 surveillance expansion that <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/interactive/2013/jun/27/nsa-inspector-general-report-document-data-collection\">extensively detailed</a> the court\u2019s decisions. Furthermore, the court considered that disclosure \u201cdiscretionary\u201d, rather than establishing a first amendment precedent. </p> <p>Now the ACLU is asking for significantly broader releases of secret surveillance-law decisions.</p> <p>\u201cAs the revelation of the Yahoo! order underscores, an unknown number of legal opinions and orders assessing the constitutionality of and statutory basis for the government\u2019s surveillance activities remains hidden from the public,\u201d the ACLU states in its motion.</p> <p>The Fisa court opinions sought to include the Yahoo order; a measure delivered to Microsoft that gave the government <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/11/microsoft-nsa-collaboration-user-data\">access to users\u2019 encrypted communications</a>; a ruling addressing the government\u2019s ability to track location data from bulk cellphone interception; an order allowing the CIA and FBI to collect <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/15/us/cia-collecting-data-on-international-money-transfers-officials-say.html\">massive amounts of financial data</a> under the Patriot Act; and a measure addressing a government effort to compel technology companies to hand over <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.zdnet.com/article/us-government-pushed-tech-firms-to-hand-over-source-code/\">proprietary source code for national-security exploitation</a>.</p> <p>Other Fisa court opinions sought to discuss restrictions on surveillance, including the circumstances under which the NSA cannot search through its massive troves of intercepted communications, and information sharing with private companies to guard against data breaches. </p> <p>As the ACLU filed its motion with the court, Yahoo\u2019s general counsel requested aid from the nominal chief of US intelligence in addressing public anxieties around the reported email scanning program. </p> <p>Yahoo lawyer Ron Bell said that the company is \u201cunable to respond in detail\u201d to \u201cbroad speculation\u201d about the program due to US classification rules, and US director of national intelligence James Clapper was \u201cwell positioned to clarify this matter of public interest\u201d.</p> <p>Bell urged Clapper in a Wednesday letter to \u201cconfirm whether an order, as described in these media reports, was issued\u201d and to \u201cdeclassify in whole or in part such an order, if it exists\u201d.<br></p>",

  "<p>David Cameron\u2019s No 10 policy chief warned him a year ago that he was \u201cexposed on Heathrow\u201d because the government did not have an answer to its impact on air quality, an internal Downing Street note has revealed.</p> <p>The memo was written by Camilla Cavendish, a former Downing Street adviser, who was scathing about the first draft of a government air quality plan from the department of the then environment secretary, Liz Truss.</p> <p>\u201cThere are three problems with Liz\u2019s clean air plan as currently written,\u201d the note from September 2015 says. \u201cFirst it is still very much a draft which quotes initiatives that are likely to be abolished \u2026 Second it both overclaims and underwhelms.</p> <p>\u201cIt says we want the cleanest air in the world but does not even begin to tackle the fundamental question of how we might help people to shift away from diesel cars. Third, it leaves us exposed on Heathrow where we don\u2019t yet have an answer on air quality.\u201d </p> <p>This week in the high court, ClientEarth, an environmental law group, has argued that the government\u2019s plan to clean up levels of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) fails to adhere to the law.</p> <p>Theresa May is preparing to make a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/oct/19/theresa-may-accused-of-dither-and-delay-over-heathrow-airports-expansion\" draggable=\"true\">decision on airport expansion in the south-east</a>, with all the signs pointing to a choice of a third runway at Heathrow. She came under fire on Tuesday for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/oct/18/airport-expansion-vote-put-on-hold-for-more-than-a-year-by-theresa-may\" draggable=\"true\">putting off a parliamentary vote</a> on expansion for another year. </p> <p>Sadiq Khan, the London mayor, who backs expansion at Gatwick, said: \u201cThe government\u2019s decision to yet again delay deciding where to build a new runway will cause unnecessary uncertainty for British businesses already struggling with Brexit.</p> <p>\u201cNow more than ever, businesses need certainty and stability in order to make investment decisions and to keep jobs in Britain. Instead they are getting dither and delay.\u201d</p> <p>Sources at No 10 rebutted the suggestion that there had been any delay to airport expansion plans, saying there was no change in the timetable and a decision on developing either Heathrow or Gatwick would be taken next week.</p> <p>Cameron put off the decision on Heathrow in early December last year, saying the government would undertake more work on the environmental impact of airport expansion. But the government published its national air quality plan <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/dec/17/illegal-air-pollution-will-blight-many-uk-cities-for-at-least-five-years\">later that month</a> with little reference to Heathrow and has not expanded on it publicly since then.</p> <p>Cavendish, who is now a Conservative peer, said on Wednesday night: \u201cNow this is in the public domain I have to say that I believe successive governments have failed the public on air quality. Too many people in Whitehall and parliament think they can play it down because it\u2019s invisible. </p> <p>\u201cBut the scientific evidence shows that air pollution, especially particulates from diesel vehicles, is a growing threat to health. I continue to believe that government policy underwhelms and overclaims, including on Heathrow where expansion will increase pollution.\u201d</p> <p>Air pollution causes 50,000 early deaths and \u00a327.5bn in costs every year, according to the government\u2019s own estimates, and was called a \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/apr/27/uk-air-pollution-public-health-emergency-crisis-diesel-cars\">public health emergency</a>\u201d by MPs in April.</p> <p>Observers said Cavendish\u2019s briefing to Cameron showed the government knew Heathrow expansion was problematic for compliance on air quality, and that the handful of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/13/electric-vehicles-could-go-first-at-traffic-lights-under-uk-clean-air-zone-plans\" draggable=\"true\">clean-air zones planned by ministers</a> were not enough to tackle pollution from diesel cars.</p> <p>Caroline Lucas, the co-leader of the Green party and MP for Brighton Pavilion, said: \u201cThis revelation confirms what many of us have been saying for months: Heathrow expansion cannot go ahead if we\u2019re serious about protecting the environment. Not only would expansion mean additional emissions from aircraft, but it\u2019s highly likely that there would be more fumes from road traffic blighting the local area too. The government has clearly buried this inconvenient memo in the hope of railroading this section through, irrespective of its legality and the impact on local people.\u201d</p> <p>Simon Birkett of the Clean Air in London campaign said: \u201cWhether it\u2019s a big or little impact, it doesn\u2019t matter if it makes it [compliance] worse. This briefing shows us what I call free-market anarchists like George Osborne \u2013 people who say the car is king, and want no regulation on anything \u2013 have a disregard for human health.\u201d<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>The Davies commission on airport expansion said that a bigger Heathrow would mean extra traffic on Bath Road near the airport, leaving it with the highest concentrations of NO2 in the Greater London area. That \u201cwould delay compliance with the directive and hence would not be deliverable within the legal framework\u201d, the commission\u2019s final report said.</p> <p>A Heathrow source said: \u201cHeathrow accepted the conditions of the Davies commission in May this year. The airports commission were always clear there were no issues with air quality. However, if a judicial review or another legal case is brought, government has to have done its own research into everything the Davies commission has said. It\u2019s not enough to say the airports commission came to a particular conclusion. </p> <p>\u201cSo they have to look into the air quality plans themselves. However, if Theresa May approves Heathrow next week, it will have done those investigations by now. They will not go ahead with expansion, anywhere, if they had found air quality limits were going to be in breach, because it\u2019s a legal requirement.\u201d</p> <p>The airport\u2019s chief executive, John Holland-Kaye, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/17/heathrow-third-runway-close-to-getting-government-green-light\">said this week</a> that a study by Cambridge University into air pollution had bolstered Heathrow\u2019s case.<br></p> <p>The university\u2019s Prof Rod Jones, who has been using sensors to monitor air pollution around the airport, said his research showed the air quality problem at Heathrow was due to road traffic, not planes, and that cleaner car engines being mandated by law would bring NO2 levels down below what they are now.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u201cWe would expect \u2026 the traffic-related signature [of NO2 emissions] to drop below what it is today \u2026 even though there may be more traffic,\u201d said Jones, whose study is due to be published in about a month\u2019s time. </p> <p>A government spokesman said: \u201cThe government is firmly committed to improving the UK\u2019s air quality and cutting harmful emissions. That\u2019s why we have committed more than \u00a32bn since 2011 to increase the uptake of ultra-low-emissions vehicles, support greener transport schemes and set out a national plan to tackle pollution in our towns and cities. We cannot comment on ongoing legal proceedings.\u201d</p>",

The world\u2019s longest continuously showing movie plays in theaters across the world every week with \u201cshadow casts\u201d of actors pantomiming the action and dialogue in front of the screen, with attendees dressed elaborately as characters from the film. There is a ritual of call and response between the audience and the characters on screen, and a host of props that should be taken out or thrown at the appropriate cues. </p> <p>What if you want to turn your living room into an official Rocky Horror Picture Show screening? The first thing to know is that the experience differs from theater to theater. \u201cSome jokes are localized to a certain cast or a certain town,\u201d says Eric Garment, the 25-year-old co-director of <a href=\"http://www.nycrhps.org/rockyredux/\">NYC RHPS</a>, the organization that puts on weekly performances in New York City and has been going since 1976. \u201cThat\u2019s why it continues to be so loved and proliferate with thousands of people being involved in it.

They celebrate by going to see their science professor Dr Scott, the man who introduced them. On the way to his house, their car breaks down and they wind up in the mansion of Dr Frank N Furter, an alien transvestite who is hosting a party for the unveiling of Rocky, his hunky Frankenstein-esque creation. The innocent Brad and Janet get caught up in a world of decadence and will never be the same. The same goes for anyone watching the film for the first time.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/oct/17/best-fall-tv-2016-rocky-horror\">The week's best TV: Rocky Horror, Crazy Ex-Girlfriend and Black Mirror</a> </p> </aside>  <p>They\u2019re usually initiated before the film starts with a \u201cvirgin auction\u201d, where those who have never seen the film live are called on stage and auctioned off for sometimes-obscene objects rather than obscene amounts of money. They\u2019re also asked to perform in lewd contests. \u201cWe play a little game show called Let\u2019s Have an Orgasm and virgins fake their best one and the audience votes on the winner,\u201d Garment says. \u201cIt\u2019s great fun.\u201d</p> <p>There are some agreed upon objects that viewers are going to need to have on hand. Rubber gloves come in handy to snap when Dr Frank N Furter first gets up to his lab after singing Sweet Transvestite. Following that there is a dinner scene where Frank puts on a hat, so it\u2019s nice to do the same along with him. In the same scene he also proposes a toast, where the audience usually throws slices of toast at the screen. Finally, during the song I\u2019m Going Home, when Frank sings, \u201cCards for sorrow, cards for pain,\u201d it\u2019s customary to throw cards. Either the playing or greeting variety will suffice. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pgx1QZFNMz8\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Pgx1QZFNMz8?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Garment says there are some traditions that theater owners don\u2019t love. Throwing rice during the opening wedding scene used to be ubiquitous until clean-up crews started complaining about the mess. The same goes with people shooting water guns during the song There\u2019s a Light, when Brad and Janet walk through the rain. Janet puts a newspaper over her head in the film, which would also happen in the theater, mostly to protect a well-styled wig from all of those water pistols. There are also some arcane props that are no longer in fashion. Garment says that at the end of the song <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10YPz0F-KOE\">Planet, Schmanet, Janet</a>, various characters call Frank a \u201chotdog\u201d, which would prompt the hurling of the cylindrical mystery meat toward the screen. Yeah, no one wants to deal with flying wieners in public. </p> <p>Another time-honored tradition is yelling back at the screen at certain times during the film. For instance, every time a character says Brad\u2019s name, the audience shouts \u201casshole\u201d, and every time someone says Janet\u2019s name they shout \u201cslut\u201d. No, not very nice, but it can be very funny. There are also a few other well-worn responses, like during <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9b75ICYJDi4\">Sweet Transvestite</a> when Frank takes an inordinately long pause between the syllables \u201cantici\u201d and \u201cpation\u201d, the silence is filled with revelers screaming, \u201cSay it!\u201d </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkplPbd2f60\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/tkplPbd2f60?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>For those who want a full accounting of what to say when, there are <a href=\"http://www.mortaljourney.com/2011/04/additional-doc/rocky-horror-picture-show-audience-participation-script\">several</a> great <a href=\"http://rockyhorrordenver.com/pdfs/CEIscript.pdf\">annotated scripts</a> available <a href=\"http://web.mit.edu/adorai/Public/rhpscb.htm\">online</a>. Garment says that the biggest laughs come from those who are making it up as they go along and deviating from the script, and even including topical humor. During Time Warp, Frank\u2019s butler Riff Raff opens a coffin and there is a skeleton inside. Someone invariably shouts, \u201cSay hello to [name of recently dead celebrity].\u201d Naturally, the show can get political. \u201cRight now the flavor of the week is making specific jokes about Donald Trump and pussies,\u201d Garment says. </p> <p>It\u2019s not always the audience shouting after the movie, however.

  "<p>The Home Office is understood to be about to urgently speed up its operation to rescue unaccompanied migrant children stranded in Calais, with more than 100 expected to be bussed to Britain in the next four days.</p> <p>With bulldozers expected to arrive on the French site on Monday, the Home Office has come under fire from charities for not moving faster \u2013 while the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/19/rightwing-tabloids-pour-scorn-appearance-child-refugees\">Sun and the Daily Mail made controversial claims</a> that not all of those who are arriving are children. </p> <p>A Home Office minister, Baroness Williams, confirmed that there were an estimated \u201c1,300 children in the camp\u201d and said that 39 of the several hundred estimated to be eligible to come to the UK had been brought into the country this week in the only government update on numbers accepted so far.</p> <p>In a House of Lords debate Williams insisted no date had been given by the French authorities for the destruction of the site even though the Foreign Office had an issued an advisory notice to travellers in Calais that they could expect congestion in coming days because of the French demolition. </p> <p>Williams told the House of Lords that 14 children arrived on Monday, 13 on Tuesday and 12 on Wednesday. She said those with approval under the so-called Dublin regulations will be given sanctuary first; these allow migrants under 18 to be reunited with relatives already in another country. </p> <p>\u201cWe will transfer as many as children who qualify under the Dublin regulation before the start of the clearance,\u201d said Williams, adding that about one third of the children qualified to come to the UK. </p> <p>However, one peer, Lord Roberts, said at the present rate of intervention there would be more than 1,000 children marooned when the demolition started. <br></p> <p>He said: \u201cI am sure we all welcome the 14 who were received here two or three days ago. At the moment in Calais there are 1,020, 14 have come here, that leaves 1,006 to accommodate. With the coming winter we can\u2019t surely leave any children open to exploitation, hunger and homelessness when we have the opportunity to fulfil their need.\u201d </p> <p>The claimed change in pace comes at the end of a day of tabloid pressure on the government after the Sun, the Daily Mail and the Daily Express, among other newspapers, questioned the ages of the 13 children who arrived on Tuesday. The Sun reported on Wednesday morning that the children looked \u201csuspiciously like adults\u201d while several papers said one of the males who got off the bus in Croydon looked as old as 39 or 40, although this suspicion could not be backed up.<br></p> <p>The Home Office said it works closely with the French authorities that do the initial screening to ensure those who are given sanctuary qualify for it. One source with knowledge of the situation said photographs were misleading and they have \u201cnever doubted\u201d any of the migrants\u2019 ages.</p> <p>\u201cAll individuals are referred to the UK authorities by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/france\">France</a> Terre d\u2019Asile [charity] and are then interviewed by French and UK officials. Where credible and clear documentary evidence of age is not available, criteria including physical appearance and demeanour are used as part of the interview process to assess age.\u201d</p> <p>Home Office officials say that once refugee children have arrived in Britain they are fingerprinted as part of further identity checks. There is also the option of requesting a further local authority age assessment, which must be case law-compliant and approved by two social workers.</p> <p>A Conservative backbench MP, David Davies, had called for migrants to be subject to dental checks to determine their ages and argued that Britain\u2019s hospitality was being misused. However, the Home Office immediately <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/19/home-office-rules-out-unethical-dental-checks-for-calais-refugees\">ruled out their use</a>, criticising the technique as \u201cinaccurate, inappropriate and unethical\u201d.</p> <p>The Doctors without Borders charity which has volunteers in Calais branded the the suggestion as despicable and called for the Tory party chairman to consider discipline against Davies.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/19/gary-lineker-hits-back-at-online-abuse-over-hideously-racist-coverage-refugees\">Gary Lineker hits back at online abuse over criticism of Calais refugee coverage</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Vanessa Cowan, the British Red Cross\u2019s refugee family reunion operations manager, said it was a shame that the comments had been made because the children have been \u201crecognised as having the right to be brought here\u201d. </p> <p>She added: \u201cThese children have gone through a process and they\u2019ve applied as children and the evidence they have provided has been accepted by the Home Office that they are children and they qualify, and as such they have a legal right to be here and there\u2019s nothing else to say about this.\u201d </p> <p>She said the children could go missing if they were not transferred before the camp\u2019s demolition. \u201cThey could disappear and be put in a very vulnerable situation trying to survive outside the community. Anything can happen when you try to survive in an unfriendly environment.\u201d</p> <p>Campaigners including Citizens UK, which said it has reunited 60 children from Calais with relatives in Britain since March, claim to have identified hundreds of children in the camp who have a right to come to the UK but are unhappy about the pace of action. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/oct/19/calais-camp-charity-threatens-uk-with-legal-action-over-vulnerable-children\">It is threatening legal action</a> on behalf of 30 children and has criticised the Home Office for being slow and inefficient in its interventions.</p> <p></p> <p>Among those waiting to be reunited with their relatives on Wednesday were 13-year-old Shamsher Sherin, whose story led singer Lily Allen to break down and cry last week on a televised visit to the site. Allen tweeted: \u201cSo happy to see that Sham Sher made it to the UK safely and won\u2019t be risking his life jumping on to moving vehicles.\u201d</p> <p>Another was a 17-year-old who had escaped war-torn Syria.

The Mail used the top half of its front page to promote another double page spread inside on the \u201cchild refugees\u201d debate.</p> <p>The front page of the Sun plastered the picture of one particular refugee to illustrate a call by a backbench Tory MP, David Davies, for dental x-rays to be used to check ages, under a banner headline \u201cTell us the tooth: migrant children look 40\u201d. The tabloid\u2019s top team, including editor Tony Gallagher, are understood to have used an app that used facial recognition technology to guess the ages of the refugees \u2013 and then to raise questions about them. </p> <p>Such coverage prompted an interview with a backbench Tory MP, David Davies, on Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, which fed into an online row about how a few pictures were being used to criticise a programme to admit just 100 refugees with relatives in the UK before the Calais camp\u2019s closure.</p> <p>Nobody is expecting the refugees who arrived this week to have to go through dental tests to prove they should remain in the UK, not even Sun executives. So why has the issue become such a live one?</p> <p> \u201cThis completely undermines the case to take them in,\u201d said one tabloid executive, pointing out that none of the unidentified but quite possibly traumatised refugees had written to complain about the coverage to date. Besides, editors had looked at the pictures expecting to see young children and girls, and were taken aback by the young men in hoodies.</p> <p>All this ignored the fact that photographers cannot take pictures of minors without the consent of a guardian. Indeed by Wednesday, when pictures of far younger-looking children were made available by agency photographers, tabloid editors cited press regulation for making their use too difficult. \u201cWe would probably have to pixellate them,\u201d said one.</p> <p>Sun executives in particular, claiming to be cockahoop at having \u201cled the way\u201d on the story, seized on the pictures on Monday as proving the fears they had had all along about the resettlement scheme for unaccompanied children in Calais. \u201cWith those crows feet at 17, he\u2019s obviously been using the wrong moisturiser!\u201d hooted one.</p> <p>However, the story, which was on the print front page two days in a row, was far lower down in the Sun\u2019s online edition.

  "<p>The European commission will redouble its crackdown on multinational tax avoidance next week with the relaunch of proposals to create an overarching corporation tax regime across all member states.</p> <p>The proposed legislation would subject companies to a single set of rules for calculating their taxable profits, according to drafts seen by the Guardian. It would be compulsory for corporations with annual turnover of more than \u20ac750m (\u00a3670m) and which are tax-resident in a European country.</p> <p>Designed to curb the profit-shifting that has allowed multinationals such as Apple, Starbucks and Amazon to avoid corporation tax on substantial amounts of their income in Europe, the proposals were launched in 2011 but ran into opposition from Ireland and the UK, with the then British prime minister, David Cameron, saying he would \u201csimply say no\u201d to the plan.</p> <p>The rules are designed to ensure \u201cbusiness profits are taxed in the jurisdiction where value is actually created\u201d, according to the drafts, making it harder for multinationals to avoid tax by transferring intangibles such as brand or intellectual property to low-tax jurisdictions. European commissioners describe the proposed rules as \u201can extremely effective tool for meeting the objectives of fairer and more efficient taxation\u201d. </p> <p>All member states would have to sign up to the proposal for it to become law. While the UK may leave the EU before the legislation is passed, it retains a seat at the discussion table while it is still a member. If Britain remains in the single market, the new tax rules will apply to it too.</p> <p>The commission plans to introduce two pieces of legislation. The first, known as the common corporate tax base, would introduce new ways of calculating where a company actually makes its money. The formula looks at where the value is created, based on three equally weighted factors: assets, labour and sales.</p> <p>The second, the common consolidated corporate tax base, would put a single member state in charge of collecting all European taxes due from a particular company. Those revenues would then be shared among the other member states according to where the profits were made. This second piece of proposed legislation will be held back until the first has been agreed.</p> <p>The rules are designed to target only the largest companies, and those with cross-border activities, accounting for 64% of business turnover generated within the EU. But smaller companies could elect to join the scheme, if they feel being taxed only in one country could cut red tape.</p> <p>Large companies spend about 2% of taxes paid on doing the paperwork, according to the commission\u2019s estimates, while for smaller firms the estimate is about 30% of taxes paid. The more subsidiaries a company has, and the more it trades across borders, the higher itgo s administration costs. If all multinationals paid tax through one European country, the saving could be \u20ac800m a year.</p> <p>The proposals are likely to be resisted by Ireland, which has a low corporation tax rate of 12.5% and relies on tax competition to attract multinationals to set up head offices on its shores. Dublin is still reeling from a European commission ruling in August that it had granted <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/30/apple-pay-back-taxes-eu-ruling-ireland-state-aid\" draggable=\"true\">\u20ac13bn in illegal benefits to Apple</a>.</p> <p>In May 2011, the Irish parliament passed a motion denying the legality of the commission\u2019s original proposals, with politicians branding them an assault on the country\u2019s tax sovereignty. A similar parliamentary motion was backed by the UK government that year.</p> <p>As a next step, the proposals are likely to go to the European parliament for discussion and amendment, before being put to the council of ministers for approval. </p> <p>\u201cBritain is at a crossroads,\u201d said the Green MEP Molly Scott Cato. \u201cWill we follow Europe in promoting action on tackling corporate tax avoidance, or follow the route being pushed by some hard-Brexit supporters and become one of the globe\u2019s leading tax havens? It is clear that the public interest will be best served by remaining as close as possible to Europe on tackling the scourge of corporate tax dodging.\u201d</p>",

Australia is particularly isolated in the Asia-Pacific region \u2013 ASEAN nations, New Zealand, and almost all Pacific Island states, support a ban treaty.</p> <p><br></p> <p>Australia has a strong record on disarmament generally: during its term on the security council it helped shepherd into existence the Arms Trade Treaty, and has been one of the world\u2019s largest donors to the Office for Disarmament Affairs, contributing money for conventional disarmament and arms control, and also for abolition of biological and chemical weapons.</p> <p>But its posture on nuclear weapons, supporting the US stance that \u201cnuclear weapons continue to play a role in maintaining peace and stability\u201d, is leaving it increasingly isolated in international negotiations.</p> <p>The efficacy of a ban treaty is a matter of fierce debate. Without the participation of the states that actual possess nuclear weapons, critics argue it cannot succeed. But proponents argue a nuclear weapons ban will create a moral case \u2013 in the vein of the cluster and land mine conventions \u2013 for nuclear weapons states to disarm, and establish a new international norm prohibiting nuclear weapons\u2019 development, possession, and use. </p> <p>Non-nuclear states have expressed increasing frustration with the current nuclear regime and the sclerotic movement towards disarmament. </p> <p>With nuclear weapons states modernising and in some cases growing their arsenals, instead of discarding them, an increasing number of states are expressing disenchantment with the non-proliferation treaty, and lending their support for an outright ban.</p> <p>The Conference on Disarmament, the world\u2019s negotiating body on multilateral disarmament, has not negotiated a treaty since the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty in 1996, and it has regularly struggled to even agree on a program of works.</p> <p>Associate professor Tilman Ruff, co-president of International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War, said that with a ban treaty likely to be concluded next year, the world stood at an historic turning point.</p> <p>A ban would, he argued, \u201cfill the existing legal gap which currently makes the most heinously destructive of all weapons the last weapon of mass destruction not explicitly outlawed by international treaty\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cFor other indiscriminate and inhumane weapons ... the world has first established a clear moral and legal norm of prohibition. For biological and chemical weapons, antipersonnel land-mines and cluster munitions, establishing an unequivocal norm of prohibition has ... been the basis for subsequent progress towards their elimination.</p> <p>\u201cProhibit, then eliminate. That is the proven, logical path. For nuclear weapons it is also the only feasible, practical option at this time.\u201d </p> <p>The Australian government\u2019s position, he said, was becoming increasingly untenable globally, and falling further out of step with Australian public opinion.</p> <p>Politically, support for Australian reliance on America\u2019s extended nuclear deterrence, is no longer bipartisan. At its national conference in 2015, Labor formally adopted a policy of \u201cfirm support\u201d for an outright ban on nuclear weapons.<br></p> <p>Lisa Singh spoke at a UN side event in New York last week \u2013 in her capacity as a Labor Senator, not as a representative of the Australian government \u2013 arguing the \u201cdoctrine of nuclear deterrence ... is based on a willingness to inflict violence indiscriminately and on a massive scale\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cLike most Australians, I\u2019m strongly of the belief that nuclear weapons should play no role in our defence. These are totally abhorrent, immoral weapons. As a nation, we should support all efforts to stigmatise, prohibit and eliminate nuclear weapons.<br></p> <p>But briefing cables from Australian diplomatic posts argue imposing a ban is naive, one of a number of \u201csimplistic approaches which ignore the security dimensions\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cEffective disarmament can only be achieved by engaging all the nuclear-armed states; simply banning nuclear weapons would not lead to their elimination\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cAs long as the threat of nuclear attack or coercion exists, and countries like the DPRK [North Korea] seek these weapons and threaten others, Australia and many other countries will continue to rely on US extended nuclear deterrence.\u201d</p> <p>The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade declined to comment publicly for this story, but foreign minister Julie Bishop has argued previously: \u201c<a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/comment/we-must-engage-not-enrage-nuclear-countries-20140213-32n1s.html\">We must engage, not enrage nuclear countries</a>\u201d. </p> <p>She said a ban treaty was \u201cemotionally appealing\u201d, but an approach that would only \u201cdivert attention from the sustained, practical steps needed for effective disarmament\u201d. <br></p>",

In 2003, Mars Express made a tentative detection of the gas, which sparked excitement because methane is a short-lived gas, and on Earth it is produced mainly by life forms.</p> <p>In 2014, Nasa\u2019s Curiosity rover also detected whiffs of the gas. This increased speculation that perhaps there were microbial communities still alive on Mars, producing the gas. However, there is also the chance that the methane is produced by geological processes.</p> <p>The TGO is designed to help explore these different possibilities.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-10-19T16:23:19.961Z\">at 5.23pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-58079aa9e4b005f21833b191\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-19T16:13:59.371Z\">5.13pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Even if the lander doesn\u2019t work as planned, valuable lessons will be learnt from the attempt.

Like most of Atlanta\u2019s first season (it\u2019s been renewed for a second), within a few minutes of sitting down to watch you become aware you\u2019re entering a world that looks unlike anything else on TV.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/sep/20/atlanta-brian-tyree-henry-tv-fx-black-culture\">Atlanta star Brian Tyree Henry: if Trump gets elected 'it's going to be Mad Max'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Atlanta is what television looks like when writers and creative teams are allowed to take risks. Kenya Barris has consistently managed to push things right up to the line on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/black_ishABC?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Black-ish</a>, while making a fundamentally relatable sitcom for a broad base of American viewers. What Glover and Atlanta offer is different. Before the series aired Glover said he wasn\u2019t thinking about getting renewed: if he only had 10 episodes then so be it, this was going to be his uncompromising look at life. That\u2019s what he\u2019s delivered after years of development. There\u2019s no real narrative structure in Atlanta. There\u2019s the weapons charge hanging over Paper Boi \u2013 the rapper played by Brian Tyree Henry, whom Earn manages.<br></p> <p>Before the club episode came BAN, a standalone episode which lampooned <a href=\"http://www.bet.com/\">BET</a>, self-satisfied academics and the notion of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jun/16/transracial-definition-destructive-rachel-dolezal-spokane-naacp\">transracialism</a>. The week before that Vanessa, Earn\u2019s on and off again girlfriend, had a whole episode dedicated to her where she went out for dinner with a friend, had her lifestyle and aspirations questioned, smoked weed then tried to beat a drug test the following day by strapping a condom filled with baby\u2019s pee to her leg.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a97b532359c83744e612b41b7b97e172f3cbaf7e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a97b532359c83744e612b41b7b97e172f3cbaf7e/0_0_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"B.A.N: Alano Miller as Franklin Montague, Mary Kraft as Deborah Holt, Brian Tyree Henry as Alfred Miles.

There was the N-word debacle in the first episode, in which Earn\u2019s white friend casually dropped the N-bomb in his presence \u2013 then wouldn\u2019t dare do it in front of other black people. The BEN episode included a scathing critique of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/dec/13/rachel-dolezal-i-wasnt-identifying-as-black-to-upset-people-i-was-being-me\">the Rachel Dolezal case</a> in which a black teenager claimed to identify as a middle-aged white man called Harrison \u2013 then was unveiled as an anti-gay marriage transphobe.</p> <p>Perhaps the smartest example of Atlanta taking on race was the episode where Justin Bieber is depicted as a black teenager. He turns up at a charity basketball game, knocks over refreshments, gets into a fight and says he\u2019s found religion while being embraced by fans and the media. When Paper Boi asks why this is accepted he\u2019s told to play his part \u2013 that of the heel to Bieber\u2019s babyface. Yes, it\u2019s farcical but underneath the comedy there\u2019s a harsh truth: a black entertainer who acted like Bieber would not have a career, and rappers are pigeonholed regardless of who they are. It\u2019s subtle but pointed, knowing without being too self-satisfied, and uncomfortable viewing for some.</p> <p>Moral judgments are few and far between. When Vanessa confesses to smoking weed after the baby pee plan blows up in her face, she gets fired \u2013 but not before her boss confesses that most of the faculty smokes weed. The shooting in the first episode is background noise rather than the story arc that drives the action. As with Seinfeld there\u2019s no hugging and no learning, and no need to present the mistakes of young black people as fatal errors rather than simple rites of passage.</p> <p>This approach has been rewarded: the show became the highest-rated premiere of any basic-cable primetime scripted debut in more than three years among the coveted 18-45 age bracket.

The offence, based on <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/ny-ticket-bots-illegal-scalpers-could-face-jail-time/\">legislation introduced in New York</a>, would carry a maximum prison sentence of 51 weeks, a fine of up to \u00a35,000 or both.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a silver bullet but it will go a long way and act as some deterrent,\u201d said Adams, who was inspired to address touting after missing out on tickets to see a US rock band, Green Day. \u201cIf there\u2019s no punishment for this sort of rip-off behaviour it will continue to happen.\u201d</p> <p>Adams said he had a \u201cgood feeling\u201d about the amendment\u2019s prospects but admitted he was likely to face opposition from free market advocates in his own party. \u201cI believe in the free market but I don\u2019t believe in a crooked market. When that happens politicians need to act, irrespective of political dogma,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t see [opposition to the amendment] chiming with Theresa May\u2019s commitment to make sure we have a government that works for everyone not just a privileged few.\u201d</p> <p>Speaking at prime minister\u2019s questions on Wednesday, Adams asked May what progress had been made on responding to a report on ticket reselling <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/may/26/ticket-touts-review-licensing-enforcement\">published by Professor Michael Waterson</a> five months ago. Waterson called for an investigation about whether secondary ticketing websites such as Viagogo, GetMeIn, Seatwave and StubHub are breaching consumer rights law.</p> <p>The prime minister said the government \u201cwill be looking at the recommendations very carefully to see what can be done to address the very issue that he talks about\u201d.</p> <p><a href=\"http://fanfairalliance.org/\">FanFair Alliance</a>, which campaigns against \u201cindustrial-scale\u201d ticket touting, welcomed political steps towards tackling professional touts, who make vast profits at the expense of fans. \u201cInstinctively I suspect most people would feel that hacking into a ticket sale with the sole intention of hoovering up huge volumes of inventory to then resell at a profit would be illegal,\u201d said spokesman Adam Webb. \u201cAlong with enforcement of existing consumer legislation \u2013 something that is urgently needed \u2013 if this amendment is made law then it would help turn the tide and ensure that the ticketing market works in favour of fans, rather than touts and the under-regulated secondary platforms that they operate from.\u201d</p> <p>The Competition and Market Authority is expected to publish a review before the end of the year of whether the secondary ticketing industry, estimated to be worth \u00a31bn, is complying with the law. The Consumer Rights Act demands that ticket resellers publish information including the face value of the ticket and the seat number. But Waterson has said enforcement of the rules is patchy.</p> <p>Annabella Coldrick, chief executive of the Music Managers\u2019 Forum, said tackling bots would be a welcome boost to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/sep/10/pixies-lead-battle-against-ticket-touts\">industry\u2019s efforts to solve the problem</a> but warned that more needed to be done. \u201cThe fact that secondary companies are welcoming outlawing bots tells you how effective doing that on its own [would be],\u201d she said. \u201cIf you look on Viagogo or StubHub, trying to find out who you\u2019re buying from is nigh-on impossible. They\u2019re also supposed to show seat row and ticket number but they don\u2019t because artists could cancel those tickets.\u201d</p> <p>She added that outlawing bots would not tackle touts who pay people based abroad to buy tickets, or use multiple credit cards to circumvent ticket purchase limits.</p> <p>Earlier this year the state of New York made the use of bots a criminal offence after a report by the attorney general found that touts using a single bot had bought 1,000 tickets in one minute for a U2 concert at Madison Square Gardens.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p><br></p>",

  "<p>What do we see each morning, post-Brexit vote, when we look in the mirror? Is it a great first-world power that knows its place in an interconnected world partly of its own design, and assumes the responsibilities that flow from that? Or is it a diminished place \u2013 shorn of perspective, hollowed out in terms of compassion?

There are many elected members within our House of Commons with questioning minds and the facility for good judgment. If one examines Davies\u2019 record, factoring in perhaps his <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-20657595\" title=\"\">attack on same-sex marriage as \u201cbarking&#xa0;mad\u201d&#xa0;</a>and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/nov/13/david-davies-feckless-fathers-mp-monmouth-child-support\" title=\"\">advocacy of chain gangs for feckless fathers</a>, it quickly becomes clear that he is not one of them.

The British Dental Association, aghast, did just that, saying the tests he would like were \u201can inaccurate method for assessing age\u201d.</p> <p>But efficacy is not the issue here. Are we a nation that would stoop to treating the vulnerable human beings we would purport to help as livestock, to be collated, corralled and verified by their individual body parts? Are we willing to put those we should be rescuing from peril at further risk with a procedure that would produce no guaranteed benefit? \u201cIt is inappropriate and unethical to take radiographs of people when there is no health benefit for them,\u201d warns the dental association. Have we reached the stage where we would apply a lower set of safeguards to migrants than we might apply to ourselves?</p> <p>While the Davies dental initiative collapsed under the weight of its contradictions, its reception said much about our state of mind with relation to the European refugee crisis and specifically the continuing problems at Calais. On Tuesday, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/17/uk-moral-duty-calais-unaccompanied-children-asylum\" title=\"\">writing in these pages</a>, Bernard Cazeneuve, the French interior minister, departed from the diplomatic argot of his profession to insist that the British government intensify its efforts to identify and resettle child migrants.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/17/uk-moral-duty-calais-unaccompanied-children-asylum\">The UK must fulfil its moral duty to Calais\u2019 unaccompanied children | Bernard Cazeneuve</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The view in many countries is that Britain, sour and introverted, is failing to do its bit. In his speech at the Liberal Democrat party conference, Tim Farron <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/aid-worker-told-tim-farron-britain-must-take-some-effing-refugees_uk_57e14996e4b0d584f7f2d0a3\" title=\"\">spoke of being confronted by an aid worker</a> as he was handing out water bottles to refugees on the Greek coast. \u201cStop handing out bottles of water,\u201d she said. \u201cTake some fucking refugees.\u201d But the indication, perhaps the evidence, is that we are reluctant to take our fair share. In July <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/child-migrants-europe-house-of-lords-theresa-may-uk-government-syria-refugees-a7155516.html\" title=\"\">a report by the House of Lords European Union committee said</a>: \u201cWe deplore the continuing resistance of the UK government to show solidarity with its European partners in helping to relocate such children.\u201d A month earlier, when European leaders agreed a voluntary system for sharing the refugee burden across the continent, the UK opted out.</p> <p>And this lies at the crux of the discussions. Our preoccupation with migrant children reflects the fact that as children they will encounter the least public resistance. That is inevitable. In its way, it is laudable. We saw pictures of thousands of migrants arriving after a perilous, sometimes murderous, journey on the Mediterranean coast. But it was photographs of three-year-old <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/alan-kurdi\" title=\"\">Alan Kurdi</a>, drowned on a Turkish beach, that pricked the public conscience.</p> <p>However, let\u2019s not confuse what we are doing with what we should be doing. A charitable scheme to help isolated children \u2013 hopefully very young, with features, teeth and teddy bears to prove it \u2013 is one thing. A proper effort to fulfil our responsibilities as Europeans, whether or not we are members of the EU, is another.</p> <p>The migrants conveyed from Calais may be young enough to dispel doubts. It may be, as some suggest, that they are youths whose experiences have aged them. But as we examine them for signs of maturity or worldliness, don\u2019t lose sight of why the issue of age verification has become so important. We want to do right by a handful of children, but it is really a way of shirking our duty to do the right thing.</p> <p>\u2022 To discuss the issues raised by this piece please use <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/19/share-your-views-on-the-governments-response-to-calais-child-refugees\" title=\"\">this form</a></p>",
  "<p>New York police department officials have conceded that something went wrong in the lead-up to a sergeant fatally shooting a mentally ill 66-year-old black woman in her own home in the Bronx Tuesday night.</p> <p> \u201cWhat is clear in this one instance, we failed,\u201d police chief James O\u2019Neill told reporters Wednesday morning. \u201cThat\u2019s not how it\u2019s supposed to go. It\u2019s not how we train.\u201d</p> <p>The woman, Deborah Danner, had schizophrenia and police had visited her home on prior occasions for disturbances. According to police, they were responding to a call from a neighbor that Danner was acting in an \u201cirrational manner\u201d when the shooting occurred.</p> <p>Danner was holding a pair of scissors when sergeant Hugh Barry entered her residence, police said. Barry was able to convince Danner to put down the scissors and leave the home with him when she allegedly picked up a bat and began swinging it at the Sergeant\u2019s head.</p> <p>Barry fired two shots from his service weapon, and Danner was taken to a nearby hospital where she was pronounced dead.</p> <p>Police said that Barry was equipped with a less-lethal Taser weapon, which he did not deploy. Barry has been placed on modified duty, and was stripped of his gun and badge while the incident is investigated by the NYPD\u2019s force investigation division.</p> <p>Mayor Bill de Blasio called the shooting \u201ctragic and unacceptable\u201d in a Wednesday evening press conference, adding \u201cit should never have happened. It\u2019s as simple as that: it should never have happened.\u201d The mayor also commended the department for moving quickly to reassign the sergeant. </p> <p>That move was ridiculed by Barry\u2019s union, the NYPD sergeants benevolent association. President Ed Mullins called the shooting justified and said the decision to strip Barry of his badge was \u201cpolitically motivated\u201d.</p> <p>After what his office called a \u201crigorous review\u201d, New York attorney general Eric Schneiderman announced on Thursday that his office would not be reviewing the shooting, and that it would be left to the Bronx county district attorney to decide whether a crime had been committed. Schneiderman said that because Danner had a weapon, the incident fell outside of his authority to investigate. An executive order signed by Governor Andrew Cuomo after the death of Eric Garner gives the attorney general\u2019s office the responsibly to make determinations about fatal police incidents in cases where the victim is unarmed. </p> <p>Bronx borough president Ruben Diaz Jr called the incident \u201call too reminiscent\u201d of the case of Eleanor Bumpurs, a Bronx woman, who like Danner was 66 and dealing with mental health issues, who <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1985/04/13/nyregion/state-judge-dismisses-indictment-of-officer-in-the-bumpurs-killing.html?pagewanted=all\">was killed by NYPD officers in 1984.</a> The officer in that case was charged with manslaughter and eventually acquitted.</p> <p>\u201cWhile I certainly understand the hard work our police officers undertake to keep the streets of our city safe every single day, I also know what excessive force looks like,\u201d Diaz said in a statement.</p> <p>The shooting highlights the danger that people with mental health issues often face when they become involved with police during moments of crisis. The Guardian\u2019s long-term investigation into police killings has found that, nationwide, more than a quarter of all killings involve individuals with mental health issues. </p> <p>Danner is the seventh person described as \u201cemotionally disturbed\u201d to be killed by NYPD officers in the last three years, according to the New York advocacy group Communities United for Police Reform.<br></p> <p>\u201cNo person in need of mental health services should end up dying like this,\u201d said Donna Liebman, executive director of the New York ACLU. \u201cThe questions raised by such a disproportionate use of force are especially important in a context where across the country people are asking if law enforcement values enough the lives of people of color.\u201d </p> <p> Danner is the 10th black woman to be killed by police in 2016 and the first since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/02/korryn-gaines-black-woman-killed-by-police-son-injured\">Korryn Gaines was killed by officers</a> in Baltimore in a high-profile August incident. </p>",

He said: \u201cThey had the whole place locked down yesterday so nobody could get out of their cells. It\u2019s disgusting. It\u2019s a horrible place in there.</p> <p>\u201cAfter what happened yesterday, I\u2019m going straight now. Pentonville is one of the most violent prisons in London.\u201d</p> <p>Bhatt and another source said the attack took place inside G wing.</p> <p>HMP Pentonville is a category B Victorian prison that opened in 1842 and holds more than 1,200 men.</p> <p>An inspection report on the jail published last year said: \u201cMost prisoners felt unsafe; levels of violence were much higher than in similar prisons and had almost doubled since the last inspection.\u201d</p> <p>Plans to shut old Victorian jails have been outlined as part of a modernisation drive, with only HMP Holloway in north London confirmed as facing closure so far.</p> <p>A Ministry of Justice spokeswoman said: \u201cThe secretary of state has been clear that safety in prisons is fundamental to the proper functioning of our justice system and a vital part of our reform plans. We are fully committed to addressing the significant increase in violence, self-harm and self-inflicted deaths in our prisons.\u201d</p> <p>Official figures show there were more than 20,000 assaults in prisons \u2013 2,813 of them deemed \u201cserious\u201d \u2013 in the 12 months to December, a rise of 27% year on year, with nearly 5,000 attacks on staff \u2013 a jump of more than a third compared with 2014.</p> <p>The data also showed there were six apparent killings in the year to March 2016, up from four in the same period in 2015 and the largest number for a year to March since current records started in 2000.</p> <p>The PGA\u2019s national policy officer, John Attard, told the Press Association: \u201cThe Ministry of Justice statistics paint a very grim picture indeed.</p> <p>\u201cSadly, it comes as no massive surprise to anybody close to this that we have had a tragedy such as this. The prison service paid staff to leave \u2013 the years of experience, the mentoring, the sharing of their experiences, a lot of that has been lost, and it is showing. It\u2019s why we need an inquiry into this.\u201d</p> <p>Speaking outside the prison gates, Attard told the Guardian: \u201cWe called for an independent public inquiry a week ago. The reduction in staffing is a key factor, there\u2019s no doubt about that, but synthetic drugs also had some part in that. What we would like to see is a regime that can be managed safely with the right number of staff.\u201d</p> <p>He said the prison was one of the most dangerous in the country and would be at maximum security while it was searched. \u201cPentonville is one of the busiest prisons and it will, by its very nature, be one of the most violent prisons as well,\u201d he said. <br></p> <p>\u201cRight now it will be on lockdown. With additional support from other prisons, all of the prison will be searched and there will be a hunt for any weapons, mobile phones, drugs and tools.\u201d </p> <p>The Prison Officers Association said it \u201conce again\u201d has serious concerns following the incident, and it warned \u201cthe unprecedented rise in violence in all of our prisons must not be underestimated\u201d.</p> <p>Visitors queuing inside the prison spoke of their safety concerns. A woman visiting her son initially feared he could have been the victim. She said: \u201cMy son is 21, I haven\u2019t felt the same since I heard the news.</p> <p>\u201cAs a mother, everyone tells you at least you know where he is and he is safe \u2013 but actually he\u2019s not safe, is he? No matter their age or what they have done, no one deserves to die in prison. It is supposed to be a place of safety.\u201d</p> <p>Another woman said: \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be allowed to happen anywhere, let alone in prison. It\u2019s obviously not safe in there.\u201d</p> <p>Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary, whose Islington South and Finsbury constituency includes Pentonville, gave her condolences to the family of the victim. The prison, she said, was completely inappropriate for modern needs and should be shut down.</p> <p>She told ITV News: <em>\u201c</em>It is unsafe, it is rat infested, it was built in 1842. It is an absolute shame on our country that we continue to put people into that prison. I believe that if you commit a crime, your liberty should be taken away. That is enough. You should not be subjected to the conditions in Pentonville today.<em>\u201d </em><em><br></em></p> <p>She added: \u201cDespite the efforts of staff to make the best of difficult circumstances, the prison is overcrowded, understaffed, and plain dangerous both for staff and prisoners. A prison built to house 900 inmates now holds 1,300, and there is scant provision for the most vulnerable amongst them.</p> <p>\u201cIt has the additional problem that \u2013 as a prison primarily used to hold inmates on remand and on short sentences \u2013 its high turnover makes for a naturally unstable and volatile environment, not helped by the easy availability of, and roaring trade in, drugs.\u201d</p> <p>Police were called to Pentonville prison at around 3.30pm on Tuesday. Officers and paramedics found three prisoners with stab wounds.<br></p> <p>Two men, aged 21 and 30, were taken to an east London hospital, where they remained in a critical condition, a Metropolitan police spokesman said on Wednesday.</p> <p>Two men, aged 34 and 26, have been arrested in connection with the incident.</p> <p>\u2022 The headline on this article was amended on 20 October 2016.

He did not say anything sensational or indiscreet in his evidence to the select committee, but for someone committed to giving \u201cno running commentary\u201d on Brexit, he was surprisingly candid. Here are the key points.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Hammond said the government should keep its Brexit options as open as possible and he appeared to criticise his Brexiteer colleague who are adopting a more hardline stance.</strong> He argued that keeping options open was a good negotiating strategy. </li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I am trying not to rule anything out. Every possible combination should be considered, because I genuinely believe that every time we rule something out we hand a negotiating chip to the opposite side of the table. Keeping as many things on the table as possible is the best negotiating stance.</p> </blockquote> <p>And, in remarks that seemed aimed at colleagues like Liam Fox, the international trade secretary, he suggested that taking a firm stance against the single market or the customs union would be mistake.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>[Theresa May] needs the maximum possible space. My objective in supporting her is to ensure that she has the broadest range of options - properly costed and understood - and the maximum scope to deploy that broad range of options in what might be a wide-ranging negotiation. </p> <p>I would say that those that are undermining the effort are those that are seeking to close down that negotiating stance, seeking to arrive at hard decisions that we don\u2019t need at this stage. Keeping as many areas open, as many options open, as possible is the key to the strongest possible negotiating hand.</p> </blockquote> <p>When it was put to him that the very existence of the international trade department suggested the UK would leave the customs union (because if the UK remains in the customs union, it will not be able to negotiate separate trade deals), Hammond said that \u201cmany EU countries have trade ministries even though they are inside the customs union\u201d and that ministers in Fox\u2019s department were \u201cpromoting British trade\u201d.</p> <ul> <li><strong>He said he there were \u201cdeeply pragmatic\u201d at the top of the EU who would enable the UK and the EU to find a \u201cmutually beneficial\u201d solution to Brexit.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There has been quite a lot of position taking, as one would expect, at this stage of the negotiation. But I remain optimistic that there are, at very senior level across the European Union, some deeply pragmatic people who have shown by their actions time and again that they can find solutions when challenged with problems. And if we look at the history of the EU, how many times have people said there is no way through this problem or that problem? And yet the EU has been able to find a way through it. And I hope that pragmatism and engagement will deliver us a mutually beneficial solution. </p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He was criticised by MPs after saying he would not publish internal Treasury reports analysing the costs and benefits of Brexit. </strong>To do so would undermine the UK\u2019s negotiating position, he claimed. But Labour\u2019s <strong>Rachel Reeves</strong> said this stance was \u201cdisappointing\u201d. And <strong>Andrew Tyrie</strong>, the committee chair, said most members of the committee would probably agree with Reeves on this.</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>He ruled out Scotland being able to negotiate its own trade deal with the EU. </strong>It was for the UK as a whole to strike a trade deal, he said.</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>He said other EU countries would not want a Brexit deal that damaged the City because that would be bad for Europe as a whole. </strong>Perceptions on the continent that other European financial centres were likely to gain if London lost access to EU markets were likely to \u201cmelt away\u201d as people realised that UK jobs were more likely to go to the US, or disappear, than to go to other European countries, he said. London was Europe\u2019s financial services centre as well as the UK\u2019s, he said.</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Anything which broke up this deep and broad pool of capital and expertise in London would be hugely detrimental to the real economy across the EU as well as the UK.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He said City firms were starting to be \u201crealistic\u201d about the likelihood of them not being able to retain the \u201cpassporting\u201d regime that allowed them to operate in other EU countries.</strong> He said it in such a way as to imply he thought they were right to be \u201crealistic\u201d and to start considering alternatives.</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>He said the UK would not impose immigration controls that stopped banks hiring highly-skilled workers from abroad after Brexit.</strong></li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>He said the predictions that Treasury made about the negative impact of Brexit before the referendum were partly based on assumptions that were no longer valid.</strong> The BBC\u2019s <strong>Kamal Ahmed</strong> has written more about this.</li> </ul>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/bbckamal/status/788760367811948545\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Hammond sounds the death knell on &quot;Project Fear&quot; <a href=\"https://t.co/PmUMttLw1u\">https://t.co/PmUMttLw1u</a> My Economics Blog</p>&mdash; Kamal Ahmed (@bbckamal) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bbckamal/status/788760367811948545\">October 19, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <ul> <li><strong>He said Britain might have to beef up border controls considerably after Brexit.</strong> Asked if it was true that an additional 5,000 customs officers would be needed were correct, Hammond replied: </li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It would be our choice, of course, but assuming that we wanted to operate an efficient at-the-border customs system under World Trade Organisation rules, we may need significantly more infrastructure at the border than we have now.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He said the government would not change the way the Bank of England decided monetary policy, despite Theresa May appearing to criticise its policy of quantitative easing in her Tory conference speech.</strong> He said</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>My understanding is that what the prime inister was trying to say is that we recognise that monetary policy, which is an important tool of macroeconomic policy, has a distributional impact. And, to the extent the government believes that distributional impact needs to be addressed or corrected, we also have tools available to us to do that ..</p> <p>There will be no change in monetary policy. Monetary policy is independently determined, that will continue to be the case. The monetary policy committee will continue to make decisions on interest rates and recommendations on unconventional monetary policy.</p> </blockquote> <p>That\u2019s all from me for today.</p> <p>Thanks for the comments.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-10-19T17:11:23.021Z\">at 6.11pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-58079bdee4b005f21833b197\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-19T16:17:15.677Z\">5.17pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Leadsom says UK could strike trade deal with EU 'in very short order'</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>It will be \u201cperfectly possible\u201d to secure a free trade agreement with the European Union in a short period of time, environment secretary <strong>Andrea Leadsom</strong> told a select committee this afternoon.

We are not Canada, where there were a few hundred years of different rules and regulations that needed to be sorted out in a free trade agreement. We\u2019re certainly not China, where there is different language barriers and so on.</p> <p>There is the economics and the politics, and I think the economics says it would be perfectly possible, perfectly realistic to get a free trade agreement in place in very short order. </p> <p>Don\u2019t forget the rest of the world takes an average of just over two years to negotiate a free trade agreement, and if I\u2019m not very much mistaken that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019ve got between now and when we leave the EU, and that\u2019s for a country that hasn\u2019t aligned its rules and regulations for 43 years. </p> <p>I\u2019m extremely optimistic. The economics says it\u2019s in all our interests to seek an agreement to continue to trade freely with each other. We have a strong hand because we import more than we export.

Most experts think the opposite, says Gardiner. In a statement he says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Legal advice from the European Commission and confirmed by the House of Commons library suggests that the UK would have to renegotiate all those trade agreements concluded whilst we were members of the EU.</p> <p>If Dr. Fox has the private assurances he has claimed from non-EU trade partners, then these need to be made public and confirmed because the UK must increase its trade to these countries by 37% over the next 15 years just to stand still.</p> <p>A \u201ccross your fingers\u201d approach to what would constitute a 4.5% drop in GDP is simply not good enough.</p> <p>Today\u2019s reports again highlight just how dangerous this split in the government is.

This government is offering neither.</p> </blockquote> <p>Among those who have argued in the past that the UK would not just be able to inherit the trade deals the EU has with non-EU countries after Brexit is the Commons Treasury committee. <a href=\"http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201617/cmselect/cmtreasy/122/122.pdf\">In a report earlier this year</a> it said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Were the UK to leave the EU, it is very uncertain whether it would be able to continue to participate in these agreements.

There are two reasons why this figure does not, in our view, accurately reflect the impact of the Spending Review on health expenditure. The first is that the \u00a310 billion figure is expressed in 2020\u201321 prices, rather than the current (2015\u201316, the time of the Spending Review) prices which would normally be expected to have been used in the calculation of such figures. At 2015\u201316 prices, NHS England\u2019s budget will rise by \u00a39.5 billion between 2014\u201315 and 2020\u201321. The second reason is that the \u00a310 billion figure refers to the additional sum allocated to NHS England, not to total health spending. Part of the increase in funding to NHS England is being funded by reductions in areas of health spending which fall outside NHS England\u2019s budget, such as the public health grant to local authorities, and education and training funded through Health Education England. Those reductions amount to \u00a33.5 billion in real terms, at 2015\u201316 prices, between 2014\u201315 and 2020\u201321. The overall impact is that total health spending\u2014the Department of Health\u2019s budget\u2014will increase in real terms, at 2015\u201316 prices, by \u00a36 billion between 2014\u201315 and 2020\u201321. If the spending review period is considered\u20142015\u201316 to 2020\u201321\u2014that increase is \u00a34.5 billion. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-580766b5e4b005f21833b054\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-19T12:31:39.431Z\">1.31pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Following her question at PMQs (see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/oct/19/pmqs-may-corbyn-hammond-angela-eagle-was-subect-to-homophobic-abuse-after-challenging-corbyn-labour-inquiry-finds-politics-live?page=with:block-58075ec6e4b005f21833b01b#block-58075ec6e4b005f21833b01b\">1pm)</a> the Labour MP <strong>Lisa Nandy</strong> is now saying Theresa May must come clean about when she knew about the concerns about Dame Lowell Goddard\u2019s leadership of the child sexual abuse inquiry.

Corbyn started with two focused and very reasonable questions on mental health. It was noticeable how May seemed much more comfortable when she could talk about the police (her old portfolio) and the issue of mental health patients being held in cells, although Corbyn\u2019s \u2018this is still not good enough\u2019 argument was effective. When he turned to the NHS, he just kept highlighting the funding crisis. He was not proposing anything specific, and he effectively ruled out any A&amp;E closures (which is not a position many NHS managers would support), allowing May to outflank him by stressing the Tories\u2019 commitment to localism. But Corbyn was able to shoot down this point quite well with a jibe about the NHS Act, which may be four years old but at least is more relevant than something Andy Burnham said before the 2010 general election (increased spending being \u201cirresponsible\u201d), which was one of the lines May relied on.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-10-19T12:25:57.470Z\">at 1.25pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5807556be4b055209adaf19d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-19T11:18:41.567Z\">12.18pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Corbyn says they all want local government and the NHS to work together better. But council funding has been cut. There is bed blocking, because no care is available. The problem is caused by a funding crisis. The government had disguised the extent of the crisis through temporary bailouts. That is a good thing. But why are they in crisis in the first place. Next month sustainability plans will be published. Many are worried because of the threats to A&amp;E departments. Will there be no closures?</p> <p>May says the government will spend \u00a3500bn over the course of this parliament on the NHS. But there is a difference. She says she thinks decisions should be taken locally. The Labour party favours a top-down approach.</p> <p>Corbyn says top-down is what we got from the last government. It cost \u00a33bn. She says the government promised parity of esteem, but has just delivered parity of failure instead. Another winter crisis is looming. The Society of Acute Medicines has it right when it says the NHS is on its knees.</p> <p>May says more patients are being treated, and there are more doctors and nurses. A former health secretary said spending more on the NHS would be irrreponsible. Ed Miliband wanted to weaponise the NHS. Labour say at every election that the Tories will cut spending on the NHS. But the Tories spend more. There is only one party that has cut spending on the NHS, the Labour party in Wales. </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58075490e4b0cd26ff71eaa7\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-19T11:13:45.024Z\">12.13pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Corbyn says no one with a mental health condition should be taken to a police cell. He commends those police commissioners who have stopped this. But NHS trusts are in a crisis. NHS providers says it is the worst crisis in NHS history. In 2010 the NHS was in surplus. What has happened?</p> <p>May says the government asked the NHS to come up with a five-year plan. Simon Stevens, the NHS England chief executive, asked for \u00a38bn. The government promised him \u00a310bn.</p> <p>Corbyn says the NHS has gone into the worse crisis in its history. And yesterday Simon Stevens told the select committee he did not think the NHS was getting the money it needed.

Its poor communication, lack of consistency and absence of clarity can cost people with diabetes their livelihood.\u201d </p> <p>Nick Lyes, the RAC\u2019s public affairs spokesman, said the DVLA had to balance the interests of people\u2019s freedom to drive with that of road safety: \u201cUse of a vehicle is essential for many people to go about their day-to-day lives and for their professional careers, so any work the DVLA can do to reduce unnecessary delays is welcome. </p> <p>\u201cOver the last year, it is encouraging that the DVLA has recognised this, and has taken appropriate steps.

There is a balancing act to be had \u2013 it is vitally important that those who need their vehicles and are safe to use them can do so in the quickest time possible, but there is also a duty on authorities to keep our roads and drivers as safe as possible.\u201d</p> <p>The president of the AA, Edmund King, said: \u201cIt is essential that those that are fit to drive are able to do so and equally that those that aren\u2019t fit to drive should not be allowed to put their own lives and the lives of others at risk.\u201d<br></p> <p>The DVLA\u2019s chief executive, Oliver Morley, said: \u201cWe are sorry for the way we handled the customers\u2019 cases highlighted in the report.

  "<p>The first question of TV drama departments, when presented with a new idea, is what kind of story it is (the correct answer is usually crime or costume). But a new ITV prime-time three-parter challenges categorisation.<br><br>Him is written by Paula Milne, whose previous credits include soap (Angels), political drama (The Politician\u2019s Husband) and period (The Virgin Queen), but this one fits into no obvious box. The network describes Him as \u201cdomestic horror\u201d, but it could also be called marital-supernatural, or science-friction.</p> <p>The 17-year-old hero suffers both a common social situation \u2013 divorced parents who have started second families \u2013 and a rare one: telekinetic powers, allowing him to take out his anger towards his mum, dad and step-family by menacing them with flying or exploding objects.</p> <p>A one-line pitch might have been \u201cStephen King meets Joanna Trollope\u201d, but Milne says she thought in terms of character rather than genre: \u201cI think being an adolescent male is a very hard thing; I wanted to write about that anger and confusion. There\u2019s a story about Randy Newman, who had two boys followed by a girl. He was asked about the difference, and he said: \u2018Well, if we\u2019d had the girl first, we\u2019d have thought the boys were retarded\u2019. I\u2019ve always loved that.\u201d</p> <p>Challenging the modern doctrine that there is no real difference between sons and daughters, Milne also questions the view (often promoted after a marriage break-up) that shared access can be accomplished without too much damage to the children or guilt for the adults. When someone asks the boy in the drama, \u201chow are things at home?\u201d he replies: \u201cWhich one?\u201d </p> <p>The twice-divorced Milne says: \u201cHim is based on one of my sons. He knows, and is fine with it. I do feel guilt about the second divorce because I think I was very unforgiving. I also think I had cause. But with the children, it was awful watching them going through the upset and unhappiness, especially with the boys not being able to talk about it. \u2018Are you okay?\u2019 \u2018Fine\u2019. So I have drawn on that.\u201d<br></p> <p>Although not directly a horror story, Him shares with genre classics, including Rosemary\u2019s Baby and The Omen, a sense of the sinister possibilities of fertility. The boy has one baby step-sibling and his step-mother has another two on the way. Milne, a twin (sister of the documentary-maker Claudia Milne) who herself has twins, says: \u201cI wanted to write about the fear of being replaced or duplicated. It\u2019s a very primal thing for children.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5fa0d8b414611a20bba8d5cfda5a45aaa39700e2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5fa0d8b414611a20bba8d5cfda5a45aaa39700e2/0_345_5120_3072/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Him is based on one of my sons.

He knows, and is fine with it\u2019 \u2026 Fionn Whitehead as Him.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ITV</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For Milne, the anger-induced superpower of her protagonist, a sort of televisual grandson of The Incredible Hulk, is \u201ca metaphor for the anger in adolescent boys, their struggle to control it.\u201d</p> <p>Even so, she wanted the boy\u2019s gift to be as plausible as an unproven phenomenon can be. Whether writing about NHS nurses in Angels or Elizabeth I in The Virgin Queen, Milne always researches heavily. \u201cWith Him, I had a researcher check out telekinesis for me. It was very important to talk to people who take it seriously \u2013 paranormal researchers and so on \u2013 regardless of whether we believed in it.\u201d</p> <p>The spectrum of British TV dramatists ranges from those most devoted to dialogue (Alan Bennett, Sally Wainwright) to others (Dennis Potter, Russell T Davies) more driven by cinematic image-making. Milne, though neat with speech, acknowledges: \u201cI absolutely think in pictures. I started as an artist, and I still do the slightly wanky thing of getting a huge sheet of art paper and drawing key scenes as I see them.\u201d</p> <p>A frequent tension for screenwriters is that directors don\u2019t like being told what to show, so Milne, over four decades at the keyboard, has developed tactics for collaboration: \u201cWriting the scene descriptions is a great art. You have to put down just so much that you get the scene as you saw it, but not be so prescriptive the director feels creatively frustrated and ignores everything you\u2019ve written.\u201d</p> <p>A recent change Milne has made to her scripts is always to specify when someone is non-white. She accepts the argument of diversity champions such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/sep/30/lenny-henry-tv-industry-diversity\">Lenny Henry</a> that decisions can\u2019t be left to casting directors and must be made by writers. \u201cI always write it into the script now. Although, actually, I was early to that: I did it on Angels.\u201d </p> <p>On her medical soap, multiracial casting was easier because a diverse workforce was, even in the 1970s, the reality of the NHS. What Milne likes about Him is that race is never a plot-point or ever mentioned in dialogue.</p> <p>As part of an earlier wave of equalisation in the industry, Milne, having resigned as a BBC script editor (\u201cbecause I couldn\u2019t bring myself to give respect to bosses who hadn\u2019t earned it\u201d), created Angels and was determined not to be the only woman on the writing team: \u201cAt the time, there only really were two women writers in TV \u2013 Julia Jones and Fay Weldon \u2013 and neither was going to be doing my nursing soap. I literally couldn\u2019t find women TV writers, so I brought them in from theatre and radio. I had a deal with the producer that, for every one of his \u201cold lag\u201d men we hired, I got a young woman. As the series went on, eventually it was more than half women.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"73da77c648ce5f6f752bc849c8603fce88ceb5f6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/73da77c648ce5f6f752bc849c8603fce88ceb5f6/0_0_1087_643/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018I wasn\u2019t the only woman writing Corrie, but I was the only Southerner \u2026 Paula Milne.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"592\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I wasn\u2019t the only woman writing Corrie, but I was the only Southerner \u2026 Paula Milne.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Large/Daily Mail /REX</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Milne\u2019s writing apprenticeship was on Coronation Street, where she represented a different minority: \u201cOn that, I wasn\u2019t the only woman but I was the only Southerner, which was arguably more isolating. I was in the pub near the studio with Harry Kershaw, who\u2019d written it forever, and I said I was worried. He replied: \u2018Well, let\u2019s do the \u2018innit\u2019 or \u2018intit\u2019 test.\u2019 I said: \u2018what do you mean.\u2019 And he said: \u2018The weather is good today \u2013 innit or intit?\u2019 I had a 50% chance of getting it right, so I said \u2018intit?\u2019 And he said: \u2018You\u2019ll be fine\u2019.\u201d<br></p> <p>On the soap, writers were required to provide a cliffhanger or tantalising line going into the commercial break, and a pick-up coming out of it. When writing for commercial channels, Milne still structures her scripts around ad-breaks, but the rhythms of TV are changing, with ever more drama being binge-watched. So will screenwriters become less reliant on cliffhangers and recaps?</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s an interesting question,\u201d she says. \u201cI haven\u2019t really thought about it. But yes, I\u2019ve just written a series that doesn\u2019t use recaps. So, yes, I was much more conscious that people might be watching three or four hours in one go.\u201d</p> <p>As well as changes in viewing patterns, the sort of drama that she has mainly written \u2013 shows to be watched weekly on terrestrial television \u2013 is, she accepts, demographically threatened too: \u201cThe ages of the audiences are terrifying. 60s on BBC1, 70s on BBC2. Those viewers need serving, but the problem is that the under-35s simply aren\u2019t watching terrestrial TV. When I did The Virgin Queen, they were convinced young viewers would watch because one of the actors had been in a series the young watched. I argued that it didn\u2019t work like that \u2026 and it didn\u2019t. Even my own kids were saying: \u2018Mum you\u2019re not still writing that bloody costume thing, are you?\u2019 I supported the idea of BBC3 going online only, because at least it meant younger people watch it.\u201d</p> <p><em>Him</em><em> starts on ITV at 9pm on 18 October.</em></p>",
  "<p>Lewis Hamilton\u2019s two former bosses Ross Brawn and Ron Dennis, both giants of modern Formula One, dominate the buildup to the United States Grand Prix at the Circuit of the Americas on Sunday.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/10/mercedes-lewis-hamilton-world-championship-f1\">Mercedes insist Lewis Hamilton\u2019s F1 world championship hopes are not over</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The former Mercedes team principal Brawn, the man who brought Hamilton to the Silver Arrows, says he left three years ago because he could not trust Toto Wolff and Niki Lauda. And Dennis\u2019s future at McLaren, the team he built up to dominate the sport and where he then made a superstar of the prodigy Hamilton, is in doubt with speculation that his contract will not be renewed this year.</p> <p>Meanwhile Hamilton himself will take part in Thursday\u2019s official FIA press conference with drivers, the traditional launch of the race weekend. It was the Briton\u2019s performance at this function before the last race in Japan two weeks ago, when he amused himself <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/06/lewis-hamilton-f1-under-fire-snapchat-bunny-app\" title=\"\">with Snapchat images of his fellow drivers</a>, which upset many journalists.</p> <p>Hamilton responded to criticism of his behaviour by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/08/lewis-hamilton-walks-out-japan-gp-press-conference\" title=\"\">walking out of a press conference two days later</a>, raising question marks about his mental preparation for a race in which he once again made a poor start as his team-mate Nico Rosberg <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/09/hamiltons-troubles-continue-as-rosberg-wins-japanese-f1-grand-prix\" title=\"\">strengthened his grip on the F1 world drivers\u2019 championship</a>.</p> <p>For once, however, Hamilton has been upstaged by others. Brawn, in his forthcoming book Total Competition, published by Simon &amp; Schuster, explains the background to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/nov/28/ross-brawn-leaves-mercedes-f1\" title=\"\">his departure from the team</a> at the end of 2013. The man widely credited with the building of the current, dominating team, says: \u201cWhat happened at Mercedes is that people were imposed on me who I couldn\u2019t trust. I never really knew what they were trying to do. I mean Niki would tell me one thing, then I would hear he was saying something else.</p> <p>\u201cI was beginning to deal with people who I didn\u2019t feel I could ultimately trust; people within the team, who had let me down already in terms of their approach. Then in early 2013, I discovered [the technical director] Paddy Lowe had been contracted to join the team and it had been signed off in Stuttgart. When I challenged Toto and Niki, they blamed each other. I met them to have it out with them. And they both pointed to each other&#xa0;\u2026\u201d</p> <p>Brawn, 61, who has never returned to the sport despite a number of rumours in the past three years, adds: \u201cI think one complication in all of that was Toto and Niki became shareholders, which was an interesting decision by Mercedes. I never really understood it.\u201d</p> <p>Mercedes have been contacted by the Guardian but chosen not to comment.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Dennis, a man who has arguably done more for Formula One than any other single person, with the exception of Bernie Ecclestone, could be on his way out of the McLaren team he built to be the strongest in the world in the 1980s and early 90s. It has been a difficult few years for a team <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/nov/25/sebastian-vettel-wins-f1-title\" title=\"\">whose last victory came in 2012</a>, and their reunion with Honda has not been a happy one; they were ninth in the championship last year and are running sixth this season.</p> <p>According to Autosport, Dennis, 69, has been told by his board that he will not get a new contract when his current one expires at the end of the year. Dennis stepped down <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2009/jan/16/motor-sport-formula-one\" title=\"\">as team principal in 2009</a> but returned in 2014 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/jan/16/ron-dennis-mclaren-chief-executive-f1\" title=\"\">as chief executive officer of the team</a>.

So I think we felt very close.\u201d It is doubtless also down to the fact that their politics are \u201cpretty nearly indivisible \u2013 99.9%. Our parents were very similar. They would not have known a 10th of what I know, or a&#xa0;100th of what Bernard knows. They just thought that Franklin Roosevelt and the New Deal was the way to run a country. They had no doubts whatsoever. They weren\u2019t following the ins and outs. They thought that a&#xa0;government ought to be working for its people.

Over here, he did a masters in social work at Oxford, and eventually \u2013 when the relaxing impartiality wore off \u2013 joined the Labour party, which initially refused him on the grounds that he was a Trotskyist (which he never was, although he says it wasn\u2019t a wild accusation: \u201cThere was quite a strong, numerically very small, but strong Trotskyist movement.

The campaign was a success \u2013 they saved 80% of the provision \u2013 but it left him with no illusions about leftwing politics. \u201cAfterwards, we had a disastrous time, when the mothers of the children and the politicos who had moved into the campaign had a knockdown drag out.\u201d Talking to him is a bit like watching Marlon Brando: I get the gist, but subtitles would help. \u201cThe campaign split,\u201d he explains.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1dab9f7a17d340e503f5fedd91258211a3c33d37\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1dab9f7a17d340e503f5fedd91258211a3c33d37/0_0_2052_1532/1000.jpg\" alt=\"With Bernie.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"747\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With Bernie.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Larry Sanders/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Life intervened: tragically, his wife died when his daughter was 10 and his son, 14.

To tell the truth, I didn\u2019t get that bothered by Blair. Even in the 80s, members didn\u2019t really think the leadership thought what they thought. But Blair was certainly destructive, the way Bill Clinton was destructive.\u201d It was through the social justice, rather than climate change, that he came to the Green party, although environmentalism certainly grips him now.

Courts is an unpopular candidate anyway, an unabashed Brexiter in a&#xa0;staunchly remain area. The Lib Dems clearly have high hopes (Nick Clegg was everywhere you looked, on the train, on the high street, in a charity shop, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2010/dec/09/russell-brand-cast-rentaghost\" title=\"\">like Timothy Claypole</a>).</p> <p>It\u2019s still unclear whether this will deliver any votes to Sanders, but that\u2019s not really the point: \u201cIt\u2019s not an expectation of winning or getting a particular percentage. It\u2019s just an opportunity to say what\u2019s happening.\u201d He certainly doesn\u2019t see himself as bringing an unpopular message to hostile Conservative territory. \u201cThere are some underlying things that are the same everywhere. I talked in one stretch of an hour to a dozen young people, and all I&#xa0;have to say is \u2018housing\u2019. All 12 of them were living with their parents \u2013 they were either in education or working. That\u2019s not only where they were now \u2013 they didn\u2019t see any prospect of being able to move out. How do you defend a politics in which the majority of your young people can\u2019t look forward to a&#xa0;decent place to live? This is absolutely basic.\u201d What does he say to old people? \u201cOld people, I can strike up a conversation immediately about pavements. The county council has had 40% taken out of its budget. It means they have cut care, but they also can\u2019t afford to deal with potholes.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/apr/06/bernie-sanders-us-healthcare-nhs-larry-sanders\">My brother, Bernie Sanders, has got it right on healthcare | Larry Sanders</a> </p> </aside>  <p>His arguments are confident and coherent, but he\u2019s not optimistic about the Labour party getting itself into shape in time for the next election, nor about the possibility of a&#xa0;progressive alliance coagulating into an electoral force. The most he thinks that could achieve is a groundswell of parliamentary support for proportional representation, and after that, things might change. \u201cI think there\u2019s going to be a lot of suffering, and suffering is not really good for people politically, any more than it is personally. Ukip is not the same as the National Front, but it is a drastic thing. Historically, when people are in bad financial shape and you offer them a chance to hate somebody, a significant proportion of people will take that.\u201d Furthermore, \u201cif the alternative is some sort of revolution, I don\u2019t see it and I don\u2019t want it\u201d. However, he returns, finally, to his brother\u2019s success. \u201cBefore Bernard did it, nobody except him and me and his wife would have predicted it could happen.\u201d In the quagmire of the US presidential election, it\u2019s hard to remember much that was hopeful. But there was, unmistakably, a resurgence of socialist ambition. If it could happen there, why should something 99.9% similar not happen here?</p>",

So, without further ado, here\u2019s what you wanted to know from the smartphone generation\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2011/may/07/twilight-zone-rod-serling\">Rod Serling</a> (copyright: Guardian reader Meestercat) \u2026</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ea71e6967a83b2e86f96b7daeeb5cc43f96d6373\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ea71e6967a83b2e86f96b7daeeb5cc43f96d6373/59_136_4016_2409/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bryce Dallas Howard Black Mirror Nosedive\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Future imperfect: Bryce Dallas Howard in Black Mirror series three, episode one Nosedive.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Dettmann/Netflix</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Bearing in mind the past, the present and the possible future \u2013 would it be better if I had never been born? <br></strong><strong><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/sara-pascoe\">Sara Pascoe</a><br></em></strong>What\u2019s depressing is that I wonder that myself. Now that I\u2019ve got kids, I can get quite fatalistic about thing like nuclear weapons. They\u2019re all primed, ready to go off at the drop of a hat and I think we\u2019ve been incredibly lucky that hasn\u2019t happened yet. And now we have the world getting more polarised and tense ... I remember, as a kid, when the reality of nuclear weapons dawned on me, I couldn\u2019t work out why everyone wasn\u2019t running around panicking rather than sitting in cafes having a coffee. Hopefully, some supervillain threat will come down and we will have to unite as a species and fire our nukes into the sun or something. So, yeah, I\u2019m on the fence about whether or not it\u2019s worth being born.</p> <p><strong>What\u2019s the point? <br></strong><strong><em>The Great Edmundo<br></em></strong>There is no point.

Discuss.<br></strong><strong><em>Dave Gould<br></em></strong>Where do you start? Even if he loses, you worry about what he has whipped up. His popularity doesn\u2019t come from nowhere. There\u2019s a large swath of people who are so fucking furious they feel that someone who represents a massive fuck-you to everything is a good idea. You have to address that because it ain\u2019t going away.</p> <p><strong>As a writer, do you ever look at Trump and think: \u201cI\u2019d never get away with that!\u201d?<br></strong>Oh, yeah. We did an episode of Black Mirror [The Waldo Moment] about a cartoon character who ran as an MP, and I remember thinking about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/boris\">Boris Johnson</a>, but I wasn\u2019t sure we had quite got it right. Some of the criticisms of that episode, which I thought were valid, were that they didn\u2019t think a character that crude and basic would ever catch on. Then you look at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Trump</a> and you go: \u201cWell ...\u201d But you would never accept Donald Trump as a work of original fiction ... it would be panned as way too implausible. I have no idea where political satire goes after this.</p> <p><strong>Did you watch the presidential debates?<br></strong>Bits of them. I find it remarkable that anyone could support him based on his demeanour and the way he speaks. But then I thought that with George W Bush: \u201cHow can anyone watch him answering questions and not see what I\u2019m seeing?\u201d But is that just the way my brain is coloured that makes me see that? That\u2019s what I keep trying to work out. Is it just an optical illusion that some people see this, and some people see that, like that thing where you either see a young woman or an old lady?</p> <p><strong>If you hate devices so frigging much, why don\u2019t you throw them away or boil them?<br></strong><strong><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/armandoiannucci\">Armando Iannucci</a><br></em></strong>I don\u2019t hate them!

If I do, I have porridge or Weetabix or Shreddies or Coco Pops. As for music, I\u2019ve always suffered from insomnia but I\u2019ve discovered these things called SleepPhones, which are like headphones that come in a headband, so you can sleep on them without it hurting. I\u2019ve listened to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2016/may/08/radiohead-a-moon-shaped-pool-review\">A Moon Shaped Pool by Radiohead</a> every night pretty much since it came out and I\u2019m out after 30 minutes. I also listen to music when I\u2019m running but I\u2019ll sound like a wanker if I try and describe that; it\u2019s literally everything from minimal techno to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/aug/23/grandstand-countdown-ski-sunday-unsung-composers-tvs-greatest-theme-tunes\">KPM library music</a> to some fucking rap act that I shouldn\u2019t be listening to at my age.</p> <p><strong>Now, you\u2019re writing your own scripts, after years of reviewing them. What took you by surprise about the process of writing?</strong><br><strong><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/russelltdavies\">Russell T Davies</a><br></em></strong>How bloody hard it is. And how the process of writing never really ends because it carries on into the edit suite and beyond that ... you can change a lot in the edit. Now, I can spot moments in shows where they\u2019ve made a change and are wallpapering over the cracks; you add lines and just see the back of someone\u2019s head. That happens so often you wouldn\u2019t believe it. Actually, Russell gave me one of the best tips when I interviewed him once. He said that most conversations were just two monologues clashing, because people hardly ever listen to each other. And he\u2019s right: if you just have two people throwing their own monologues at one another it ends up sounding more realistic.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I\u2019ve listened to A Moon Shaped Pool by Radiohead every night since it came out and I\u2019m asleep after 30 minutes</p> <footer> <cite>Charlie Brooker</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>If the choice between the Tories and Ukip can be likened to one between a vampire and a zombie, which is which?</strong><br><strong><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/paul-mason\">Paul Mason</a><br></em></strong>Is this a real question or just one somebody <a href=\"https://twitter.com/paulmasonnews/status/786678986990620673\">recorded him asking in a cafe</a> and he\u2019s going to be really angry about it?

And I thought: \u201cWell, how do I get out of this?\u201d If I met someone at a barbecue and said I reviewed computer games for a living they would look at me like I\u2019d said: [wobbles lips with fingers] \u201cBlibablibablibablibblibliber.\u201d You might as well have said: \u201cI model balloon animals for a living and I\u2019m really bad at it.\u201d I was just lucky to do the <a href=\"http://www.tvgohome.com/\">TV Go Home [spoof TV listings] website</a> at a time when the internet was coming out and I was nerdy enough to know how to do that. It was the sort of thing that could have been in a million different comedy books, but because it was on the internet it led me to doing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/charliebrooker\">stuff for the Guardian</a> and getting a comedy-writing job. Nowadays, there are a million billion talented people all doing stuff on the internet where they\u2019ve written, presented and edited these things, way beyond what I could have done, but now they\u2019re in competition with a million billion other people. So I look back at my career and say: \u201cPhew!\u201d, like I got off the embassy roof on the last remaining helicopter.</p> <p><strong>Do you consider yourself to be one of the great dystopianists, like </strong><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/georgeorwell\">George Orwell</a> or Aldous Huxley? <br></strong><strong><em>Aras Basmacigil<br></em></strong>Ha, no!

He\u2019s quite method you see, so he did actually do it. No, no, he didn\u2019t ... I was there that day on set with my wife and we were all hiding in a cupboard around the corner. It was quite funny because Otto the director didn\u2019t shout \u201ccut\u201d when we were shooting that scene. He just left Rory going closer and closer to this pig until he said: \u201cI\u2019m not going any further ...\u201d</p> <p><strong>How far did he go?<br></strong>Oh, he didn\u2019t even get near first base.

I\u2019m a softy, really, in that respect. But I\u2019d like to see her have a complete change of heart. So, perhaps she could find a magic whistle that gives her a complete change of heart.

That\u2019s a really rubbish answer. But that episode was supposed to be about having empathy for anyone.

I expected him to show up and be his Brass Eye persona. But instead he bounded in, long curly hair, quite goofy and animated ... laughing and jolly. It was so disarmingly not what I expected that in reality he wasn\u2019t intimidating. Having said that, I remember the first day we were shooting Nathan Barley \u2013 he was so laser-focused and serious I thought: \u201cWhat the fuck\u2019s happened? Has something bad happened?\u201d He was like a dog that had seen some meat: frozen and super-concentrating. And sometimes, if he\u2019s intellectually interested in something, he\u2019s straight on it and will bombard you with questions about it in a way that you feel any answer you give will be stupid.

I think we will probably kill us. Maybe our best way out of it is to invent robots who can kill us in a really gentle way. If we ended up like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/keanureeves\">Keanu Reeves</a> at the start of The Matrix, where he\u2019s plugged into the dreambox or whatever, that wouldn\u2019t be so bad. The tragedy of that film is when he pulls the plug out. It\u2019s all downhill from there.</p> <p><strong>Is it true you were inspired by drone-strike victims?<br></strong>Loosely ... there\u2019s an episode in this season called Men Against Fire, which is to do with this book called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_Killing\">On Killing [By Dave Grossman]</a>, about the psychological effect of distance on killing. It was pre-drones, but it talks about how the people who dropped firebombs on Dresden, even though they knew intellectually they were boiling women and children to death, didn\u2019t suffer the level of psychological trauma as someone who, say, had to stick a knife in someone\u2019s ribs. There\u2019s also another project I was working on that I might return to \u2013 it was like a long-form Black Mirror and that had drone animals walking around.</p> <p><strong>How posh are you? <br></strong><strong><em>HoG<br></em></strong>By background not very.

Also I\u2019m drinking a green tea right now in a fancy restaurant ... so I don\u2019t really know. I\u2019m definitely a lot posher than I used to be, but I don\u2019t like posh things, particularly. I don\u2019t eat in posh restaurants or drink posh wine because I don\u2019t really get it. But I make TV shows so I must be quite posh.</p> <p><strong>What\u2019s the poshest thing you\u2019ve ever bought?<br></strong>An upgrade on a flight.

  "<p>I didn\u2019t give much thought to Canada for the first 18 years of my life. Many Americans would not see this as a problem \u2013 Americans who think of Canada as \u2018America\u2019s hat\u2019. But when I found myself in a bar with hundreds of Canadian strangers on my first night at university in Montreal (a city where I could legally go to a bar at 18), I realized that this had been a tremendous oversight. </p> <p>\u201cWho\u2019s the prime minister of Canada?\u201d someone asked me, when I confessed my American-ness. I had no idea, and it hit me like a hockey puck smashed into an unguarded net: my ignorance of Canada was an awful oversight. For my whole life all of these Canadians had been living in Canada, not wanting to be American, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://mentalfloss.com/article/81468/why-do-canadians-drink-milk-bags\">drinking milk from bags.</a> </p> <p>Perhaps that\u2019s why I was particularly moved by <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/18/world/americas/sympathetic-canadians-have-a-message-for-americans-you-guys-are-great.html?module=WatchingPortal&amp;region=c-column-middle-span-region&amp;pgType=Homepage&amp;action=click&amp;mediaId=thumb_square&amp;state=standard&amp;contentPlacement=3&amp;version=internal&amp;contentCollection=www.nytimes.com&amp;contentId=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2016%2F10%2F18%2Fworld%2Famericas%2Fsympathetic-canadians-have-a-message-for-americans-you-guys-are-great.html&amp;eventName=Watching-article-click\">the sympathetic message sent south this week</a> by some lovely northern neighbors: <em>America</em>, they say, <em>you guys are already great</em>. Designed by a Toronto-based creative agency, the video and accompanying social media campaign aims to help Canadians to \u201cmake a positive contribution to an election season that has been downright depressing\u201d.</p> <p>Like an ignored younger sibling reaching out to give a gentle squeeze of the hand to a pompous, bullying older one in a time of sudden vulnerability, it\u2019s a most Canadian acknowledgment of our current predicament. Polite. Sensitive. Cheerful. Gently overlooking the fact that Canada rarely crosses the mind of many Americans unless they\u2019re looking for a way to easily emigrate if national leadership is passed into the hands of a despotic, racist egomaniac by a bonkers electorate.</p> <p>Americans often speak as if \u201cmoving to Canada\u201d to escape the worst of the United States is a decision that can be made casually. We discuss the idea as though we believe that Canada is but a giant, pleasant, snowy backyard that we can wander into when we feel like it. </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/us-money-blog/2016/may/12/donald-trump-president-move-to-canada\">That\u2019s far from the case</a>, and not just because you do have to complete a rigorous visa application process. As I learned that night so many years ago, many Canadians do live up to their national stereotypes of being <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/humor/borowitz-report/canada-fears-photo-of-prime-minister-with-pandas-could-worsen-american-refugee-crisis\">friendly cuddlers of panda bears</a>, and people who will apologize with genuine feeling if you step on their foot. But despite 75% of Canadians living 100 miles (or fewer) from our northern border, they\u2019re proud of their distinctly non-American national identity and don\u2019t regard us with particular envy \u2013 ever, not only when we\u2019re in dire circumstances.</p> <p>Is there a note of smugness to the #tellamericaitsgreat campaign? Perhaps just a touch. But I learned from my years in Canada not to hold a grudge. After all, that country, too, is far from perfect \u2013 from Vancouver to St John\u2019s, there\u2019s plenty of tussling between right and left over the same issues that cripple our government, from crime to climate change to healthcare. </p> <p>But the debate is undergirded by a level of stability most Americans can only dream about. There\u2019s a public healthcare system in place. There\u2019s a federal government <a href=\"http://www.climatechange.gc.ca/default.asp?lang=En&amp;n=E18C8F2D-1\">commitment</a> to work on climate change. And <a href=\"http://globalnews.ca/news/1354803/fact-checking-michael-moore-does-canada-have-more-guns-per-capita-than-the-us/\">contrary to rumor</a>, Canada has far fewer guns per capita than the US, and far fewer gun-related deaths (one study found that \u2018<a href=\"http://globalnews.ca/news/2378037/gun-violence-by-the-numbers-how-america-canada-and-the-world-compare/\">you\u2019re more likely to be shot to death in the US than to die in a car accident in Canada</a>\u2019). In 2009, the inauguration of President Obama <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2009/feb/17/barack-obama-canada\">made some people speculate</a> that Canadians would no longer be able to look down on their southern neighbors the way they once did. </p> <p>They shouldn\u2019t have worried. If, indeed, not being American is a defining part of Canadian identity, is there any better time to be Canadian than the autumn of 2016? </p>",
  "<p>What\u2019s the CIA\u2019s brilliant plan for stopping Russian cyber-attacks on the US and their alleged interference with the US election? Apparently, some in the agency want to escalate tensions between the two superpowers even more and possibly do the same thing right back to them. </p> <p>NBC News <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/cia-prepping-possible-cyber-strike-against-russia-n666636?cid=sm_tw\">reported late last week</a> that the CIA is working up blueprints for an \u201cunprecedented cyber covert action against Russia\u201d, and it sounds a lot like they\u2019re planning on leaking documents on Vladimir Putin, just as the Russians are accused of doing to the Democratic National Committee and the Clinton campaign.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>NBC reported that former intelligence officials said \u201cthe agency had gathered reams of documents that could expose unsavory tactics by Russian President Vladimir Putin\u201d and another former official said the US \u201cshould \u2026 expose the financial dealings of Putin and his associates\u201d.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Hacking foreign governments \u2013 including political parties \u2013 is a US pastime, as even the former ex-NSA chief Michael Hayden <a href=\"http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/301667-former-cia-and-nsa-head-suggests-us-also-hacks-political-parties\">openly admitted this week</a>. \u201cA foreign intelligence service getting the internal emails of a major political party in a major foreign adversary?

That\u2019s not to excuse Russia\u2019s alleged actions, but everyone feigning shock and horror over this needs to take a deep breath because we are rapidly spiraling towards not just a digital cold war, but <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://twitter.com/adamjohnsonNYC/status/787189230929870848\">perhaps something far worse</a>.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>The question a lot of people were asking when this NBC News story came out is: why was it leaked? There\u2019s a couple of possibilities beyond the usual \u201cthe CIA can\u2019t keep a secret\u201d \u2013 which they obviously can when they want to. To me, the most likely scenario is this could be the CIA\u2019s attempt to back President Obama into a corner by putting public pressure on him to approve such an escalation in cyberwarfare.<br></p> <p>So far, Obama has (commendably) <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/08/almost-everyone-gets-russia-wrong-apart-from-obama\">been virtually the only official or politician</a> in DC not to succumb to scaremongering and dramatic cold war 2.0 rhetoric when it comes to Russia. That hasn\u2019t stopped him from criticizing Putin when he should. But he\u2019s not pretending like Putin is some 11th-dimensional chess mastermind, pulling the strings behind every twist and turn in presidential poll numbers, like the rest of Washington.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>There\u2019s also a chance the whole thing is a ruse, where the CIA purposefully leaks a fake story for the purposes of attempting to scare Russia. But assuming the CIA plans are real, why on earth do all these national security geniuses think this is a good idea? Countless politicians have spent the last four months saying how \u201cunprecedented\u201d and \u201cdangerous\u201d Russia\u2019s actions are, so now the magic solution is to do it back to them?<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/25/russia-blame-dnc-email-hack-premature\">The rush to blame Russia for the DNC email hack is premature | Trevor Timm</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Who thinks that once the US leaks some documents back on Putin that he\u2019ll suddenly be like \u2018oh, you got me, I guess we\u2019ll stop!\u2019 The more likely scenario is that this half-baked idea will escalate the cyber tensions rather than act as a deterrent.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Remember, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/08/world/europe/vladimir-putin-panama-papers-american-plot.html\">Putin reportedly thinks</a> that the Panama Papers leak was the work of the US government (even though there\u2019s no evidence to suggest it was) and some think the current leaks involving US politicians are his revenge. This potential CIA operation will, in his mind, only confirm his suspicions.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Putin is also much less susceptible to public pressure than US politicians are (given his alleged heavy-handed dealings with his opponents) and has increasingly attempted to implement draconian internet surveillance laws which he\u2019ll surely use to his advantage if the US does go through with this plan.<br></p> <p>Why does the reaction to alleged Russian actions have to turn into a contest in who\u2019s the bigger tough guy? It\u2019s hard to remember that just a year and a half ago, the supposed biggest cyber threat in US history was China. They were alleged to have stolen billions of dollars of intellectual property and then were accused of hacking tens of millions of people\u2019s security review files from the US government going back decades.<br></p> <p>Instead of saber rattling about an unprecedented wave of cyber-attacks, the <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-06-28/u-s-cyber-deal-with-china-is-reducing-hacking-official-says\">US government negotiated with China</a>, and the attacks on the US, at least on the hacking of commercial secrets, slowed down significantly. (So much so that cybersecurity defense contractors <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2016/08/05/fireeye-stock-feye-earnings/\">took a big hit</a> on the stock market. Lucky for them Russia is the new bogeyman!)<br></p> <p>Russia\u2019s not going to stop gathering intelligence on American political parties just like the US is not going to stop on theirs, but maybe the US should attempt to actually de-escalate tensions by starting the process of negotiating some form of an international cyber treaty before this gets too out of control.</p>",

  "<p>Until recently I would never have considered myself a patriot.

  "<p>The taxpayer is facing a multimillion-pound legal bill after a supreme court judge found against HM Revenue and Customs in a four-year battle with the financial adviser Ingenious Media, a promoter of controversial film investment schemes.<br></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.uk/cases/uksc-2015-0082.html?platform=hootsuite\">HMRC was on Wednesday found</a> to have breached its duty of confidentiality after a senior executive at the agency <a href=\"http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/money/tax/article3905100.ece\">gave an off-the-record briefing to the Times</a> in 2012, in which he described film investment partnerships as \u201cscams for scumbags\u201d.</p> <p>Ingenious has been awarded costs, which could run to \u00a35m, and is now deciding whether to seek compensation. The firm has previously sought <a href=\"http://www.step.org/coa-dismisses-film-relief-scheme-promoter-case-against-hmrc-chief\">damages of \u00a320m</a> in its battle against HMRC. <br></p> <p>Founded by the celebrity accountant Patrick McKenna, Ingenious devised ways to use film investment rules introduced by the Labour government to minimise tax for its wealthy clients. It attracted investment from a host of famous names, including Spice Girls Geri Halliwell and Melanie Chisholm, TV stars Anthony McPartlin and Declan Donnelly, singer Robbie Williams and former Big Brother presenter Davina McCall. <br></p> <p>McKenna\u2019s net worth is estimated at \u00a3400m, but his firm\u2019s reputation has suffered. He was hauled before parliament\u2019s public accounts select committee in 2012, and three of his schemes have been challenged by HMRC, which claims to have saved hundreds of millions after taking Ingenious to tax tribunals.</p> <p>In June 2012, two Times journalists had a background briefing on tax-avoidance schemes with Dave Hartnett, the then permanent secretary for tax at HMRC. It had been agreed the meeting was off the record, which Hartnett said he understood to mean that nothing would be published. </p> <p>However, a week later some of his comments appeared in a Times article as coming from a \u201csenior Revenue official\u201d. The article included statements that McKenna had \u201cnever left my radar\u201d, that \u201che\u2019s a big risk for us\u201d, that \u201cwe would like to recover lots of tax relief he\u2019s generated for himself and for other people\u201d and that \u201cwe\u2019ll clean up on film schemes over the next few years\u201d. </p> <p>Hartnett also said Ingenious was one of two main providers of film investment schemes in the UK, which had enabled investors to avoid at least \u00a35m in tax.</p> <p>McKenna responded by launching a defamation action, which he later dropped in favour of a claim for judicial review. His case was dismissed by the high court, and by the court of appeal. But the supreme court has now found in his favour, saying HMRC breached the duty of confidentiality it owed to Ingenious as a taxpayer.</p> <p>\u201cThe fact that Mr Hartnett did not anticipate his comments being reported is in itself no justification for making them,\u201d Lord Toulson, the supreme court justice, said in his ruling. \u201cThe whole idea of HMRC officials supplying confidential information about individuals to the media on a non-attributable basis is, or should be, a matter of serious concern.\u201d</p> <p>Toulson agreed with HRMC that the information shared by Hartnett was limited in scope, but said it was not insignificant given the use the newspaper articles made of it. </p> <p>The tax office had justified arranging the briefing on the grounds that it wanted to foster good relations with the media and publicise its views about elaborate tax avoidance schemes. Toulson said these arguments \u201ccannot possibly justify a senior or any other official of HMRC discussing the affairs of individual taxpayers with journalists\u201d.</p> <p>Section 18 of the Commissioners for Revenue and Customs Act 2005 states officials \u201cmay not disclose information which is held by the Revenue and Customs in connection with a function of the Rvenue and Customs\u201d. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/feb/20/margaret-hodge-ingenious-media-tax-avoidance\">Margaret Hodge is wrong to accuse Ingenious Media of tax avoidance | Patrick McKenna</a> </p> </aside>  <p>However, tax campaigners such as the MP Margaret Hodge argue the confidentiality rules should be reformed. They say greater transparency is needed, for example on tax settlements with big companies and high net worth individuals.</p> <p>A HMRC spokesperson said: \u201cHaving earlier won this case in both the high court and court of appeal, HMRC is naturally disappointed by the judgment handed down by the supreme court.</p> <p>\u201cIt is important to clarify that this judgment has no bearing on the three Ingenious film partnerships considered by the first-tier tribunal, where HMRC was successful. This protected around \u00a3400m in revenues for the exchequer.\u201d</p> <p>Ingenious declined to comment on whether it would now seek damages, or on how much compensation it might seek. The firm <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/banksandfinance/privateequity/12142119/Film-investor-Ingenious-sells-its-1.8bn-asset-management-business-to-private-equity.html\">sold its investment management arm</a>, which managed \u00a31.8bn on behalf of its high net worth clients, to private equity earlier this year.<br></p> <p>\u201cWhat this isn\u2019t about is restricting HMRC\u2019s ability to collect taxes,\u201d said the Ingenious chief executive, Neil Forster. \u201cNor is it about restricting the freedom of the press to pursue public interest stories. This is about the principle of protecting taxpayer confidentiality and ensuring that information isn\u2019t used by HMRC contrary to its own guidelines in order to pursue relationships with the press.\u201d</p>",

Rival companies race to sign up new customers and the competition for business can lead to sharp practices.</p> <p>Curran has been exposed for taking matters too far. In a humiliating climbdown, the TV expert admitted that he used false names and accounts on social media to make defamatory claims about the Turveys.</p> <p>He is a regular on Heir Hunters, which recently completed a 20-episode series on BBC1. After leaving school at 16, he started his business in 1997 and operates from offices in Silicon Roundabout, London\u2019s technology hub.</p> <p>The trouble began in July 2014 with a series of anonymous tweets against Philip Turvey and his father, Peter, , who founded <a href=\"http://www.angliaresearch.co.uk/articles/behind-the-scenes-at-wdytya/\" draggable=\"true\">Anglia Research</a> and still works for the business. The tweets referred to them as \u201cPurvey\u201d. After a legal battle for disclosure it was revealed the accounts had been created by an employee of Curran\u2019s firm.</p> <p>In November 2014, the claimants saw a petition published on Change.org by a squatter they had evicted from a property in Charlton. As well as tracing heirs, Anglia provides administration services to help individuals claim the assets in an estate.</p> <p>The petition accused Phillip of stealing the home of the man, named only as Dave from Charlton. It claimed he had broken into Dave\u2019s home and relayed how Dave had sprayed him with a red dye he described as \u201ccriminal identifier spray\u201d. </p> <p>Though he was not involved in creating the petition, Curran has now admitted to actively circulating it. In November the link was sent to 37 freelance field agents who worked as heir hunters. That month someone using the name John Davies and claiming to be from Turvey\u2019s hometown of Ipswich published two defamatory about him comments under the petition. </p> <p>Legal disclosures revealed that the creator of the John Davies account was, in fact, Curran.</p> <p>In December 2014, the claimants said Curran again posed as a member of the public, this time with a notional claim to an estate. He posted a link to the petition on the consumer protection website Which?, where it appeared under an article headlined: Are heir hunters cheating us out of our inheritance?.</p> <p>By circulating the petition, Turvey argued Curran was in effect endorsing it. He was being wrongly accused of having \u201cconspired with a police sergeant who had sinister criminal connections to steal the property of a vulnerable adult, commit a series of serious criminal offences including conspiracy to pervert the course of justice, fraud, burglary, harassment, witness intimidation and offences under terrorism legislation\u201d. </p> <p>The petition was eventually removed from Change.org. But a trawl through Curran\u2019s emails, ordered by the courts, found the boss had sent a pdf version to his employees with the instruction: \u201cfor use whenever it may be appropriate\u201d. </p> <p>In July 2015, Turvey\u2019s solicitors wrote to Curran warning of legal action. One month later, Anglia sued for damages.</p> <p>The two firms have clashed in court before. In 2013, Finders won a county court claim against Anglia, for \u00a35,000 including costs. <br></p> <p>The pair have now released a joint statement, which says: \u201cFinders and Daniel Curran have apologised unreservedly to Philip Turvey for what happened, for the distress these incidents will have caused him, and for the harm that has been caused to his reputation as a result of the publications.\u201d<br></p> <p>\u25cf This article was amended on Wednesday 19 October. The article originally stated that the dispute had been settled after a high court case, when it never reached trial and was settled out of court. It was also amended to make it clear that Curran did not directly accuse Turvey of the allegations made in the petition. <br></p>",
  "<p>A campaigner for improved consumer rights for punters said on Wednesday that he believes a recent case in which a successful punter was forced to wait nearly a month to be paid \u00a313,000 in winnings is \u201cthe tip of an iceberg\u201d, and suggests that some online bookmakers are using their terms and conditions to delay or even avoid payment on winning bets.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/18/william-hill-online-poker-operator-amaya-end-merger-talks\">William Hill and online poker operator Amaya end merger talks</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Brian Chappell, who runs a website called justiceforpunters.org, believes that the Gambling Commission, which regulates all gambling in the UK, should take a much closer interest in online bookies\u2019 \u201cT&amp;Cs\u201d, and in particular the ways in which some rules may be used to discriminate against winning punters.</p> <p>Chappell cites the case of a punter, whose identity is known to The Guardian, who contacted his website seeking help in withdrawing about \u00a320,000 from William Hill. The punter had opened an account with Hills in mid-July, deposited a total of \u00a37,100 over the course of the next four weeks, and placed a series of mostly three\u2011figure bets on racing.</p> <p>In mid-September, when his account was about \u00a313,000 in profit, he was informed by email that Hills would no longer accept \u00a3100 bets from his account, and would in future restrict him to stakes between \u00a310 and \u00a350. He requested a withdrawal of \u00a319,600, which included his original deposit, which is when his problems started.</p> <p>Over the course of a week, the backer was asked to provide a series of documents to confirm his identity, despite having cleared the firm\u2019s standard ID procedures \u2013 as required by the Gambling Commission \u2013 on opening the account.</p> <p>Additional documents were provided as requested, but a week after the withdrawal request, the punter was told that his account was being closed because the documents could not be verified. The balance of about \u00a320,000 vanished from his account on 24&#xa0;September \u2013 but did not reappear in his bank account.</p> <p>The money remained in limbo until 5 October, when he deposited \u00a310 into what was supposedly a closed account, and duly placed a bet with it.</p> <p>\u201cCase won,\u201d Chappell says. \u201cThey couldn\u2019t pay his \u00a320,000 because they couldn\u2019t verify his account, but then they still let him deposit and bet.\u201d</p> <p>Two days later, the full balance reappeared on the account, and was successfully withdrawn.</p> <p>\u201cThis is a classic example of what some firms are doing,\u201d Chappell said, \u201cand we are getting more cases like this than anything else on the website at the moment. When people lose, they never ask for this information.</p> <p>\u201cThe bookies are trying it on, and in many cases where there are smaller amounts involved, they are probably getting away with it. The first thing they often ask for is a selfie with a driving licence or a passport. Then it\u2019s a utility bill or bank statement, but they often say they won\u2019t accept any utility bill or bank statement that\u2019s online.</p> <p>\u201cThen they say they need a paper printout from the bank, or that it needs to be unredacted and notarised by a solicitor, so you have to show them complete details of all your income and expenditure before they will pay you.\u201d</p> <p>Chappell accepts that identity checks are an essential legal requirement to prevent money-laundering and fraud, but believes extended verification procedures applied only to winning punters suggest that the system is being abused.</p> <p>\u201cIt urgently needs to be reviewed,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen someone opens an account, there needs to be a seven-day period when that account is either verified or it isn\u2019t. At the moment, the terms and conditions of many bookmakers basically say that if we want to, we can ask you for anything we want, and if we don\u2019t get it, we don\u2019t have to pay you. In my view, that has to be against consumer law, as it\u2019s completely unbalanced.\u201d</p> <p>When contacted, William Hill said that it could not comment on an individual case, but that legally, the firm was \u201cfully entitled\u201d to perform additional identity checks. \u201cUnder the Gambling Commission regulations we are obliged to carry out certain customer due diligence and anti-money laundering checks,\u201d a spokesman said.</p> <p>\u201cWe perform a number of automatic checks immediately after account registration, using information provided by the customer, along with electoral roll and debit/credit card verification. If we can\u2019t verify who a customer is or there are any queries, we ask for further details to help identify the account holder.</p> <p>\u201cIn the instance of a particularly large bet or sizeable win, we are fully entitled to ask for further checks to ensure we are happy there is no fraud or money laundering taking place. This is to ensure the company is completely compliant and we meet our regulatory requirements.\u201d</p>",

Some argued, particularly those \u201cleavers\u201d on the left, that exiting the EU would free us from having to sign up to damaging trade agreements. But actually, it looks as though it is Europe that could save us from these dodgy deals, while the Conservative government, fearing the risk of isolation and desperate for trade deals at any price, will lead us in a race to the bottom. The risk of isolation following the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\" title=\"\">Brexit vote </a>may encourage them to sign us up to even more damaging bilateral agreements than those on offer to the EU.</p> <p>Globalisation has brought us marvels including the internet and ease of international travel, but the power in this new paradigm has so far been held by corporations that exploit their ability to transcend national boundaries. Perhaps the rejection of the global trade treaties that we Greens have always dismissed as corporate power grabs might mark the beginning of the popular fight to unshackle ourselves from the chains of corporate power. With so much of the energy of the anti-TTIP fight coming from the UK, what a tragic irony it would be if we found ourselves leaping out of the TTIP and CETA frying-pan and into the fire of whatever pro-corporate trade deals <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/30/liam-fox-cabinet-speeches-trade\" title=\"\">Liam Fox</a> has in mind for us.</p>",

But if you think of puberty and what different rates children develop at, you can see how wrong these tests can be.\u201d</p> <p>Perhaps the most authoritative intervention to halt the use of such checks came in 2008, when Sir Liam Donaldson, then chief medical officer, endorsed medical and dental opposition to the use of dental x-rays to establish the age of asylum seekers. He said it was unethical to subject young people to radiation when no medical benefit was involved.</p> <p>Four years later,his successor, Dame Sally Davies, forced the UK Border Agency to suspend a renewed attempt to use dental x-rays when it became clear that they had not sought ethical permission for the programme.</p> <p>In 2001, the age determination tests were so rudimentary that all that some asylum seekers were asked to do was wave their hands at the Home Office caseworkers sitting behind a glass screen.

  "<p>\u201cWhat if\u201d, <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/10/newspapers-digital-first-214363\">asks Jack Shafer</a>, \u201calmost the entire newspaper industry got it wrong? What if, in the mad dash to put up editorial content on to the web, editors and publishers made a colossal business blunder that wasted hundreds of millions of dollars?\u201d</p> <p>He continues: \u201cWhat if the industry should have stuck with its strengths \u2014 the print editions where the vast majority of their readers still reside and where the overwhelming majority of advertising and subscription revenue come from \u2014 instead of chasing the online chimera?\u201d</p> <p>Shafer, one of the foremost media commentators in the United States, had picked up on a study by two Texas university academics, Hsiang Iris Chyi and Ori Tenenboim, called \u201c<a href=\"http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17512786.2016.1208056\">Reality check</a>\u201d.</p> <p>The authors argue that many \u201cUS newspapers\u2019 online ventures... are stuck between a shrinking market for their print product and an unsuccessful experiment with digital offerings\u201d. </p> <p>They claim that \u201cdigital first\u201d has been a losing strategy for most newspaper companies and call for \u201ca critical re-examination of unchecked assumptions about the future of newspapers\u201d.</p> <p>Now that\u2019s counter-revolutionary talk, is it not? It smacks of the kind of criticism aired at the dawn of the digital era that earned its adherents the label of dinosaur.</p> <p>But let\u2019s get to the facts. Chyi and Tenenboim studied the online readership of 51 leading US regional newspapers and compared 2011 online readerships with those in 2015. </p> <p>To their amazement, they discovered that more than half of them had lost online readers in the course of the four years.</p> <p>Despite the falling circulation of newsprint titles, they still reached many more readers than the digital content \u201cin home markets\u201d (that\u2019s an important caveat).</p> <p>Shafer writes: \u201cFor years, the standard view in the newspaper industry has been that print newspapers will eventually evolve into online editions and reconvene the mass audience newspapers enjoy there. </p> <p>\u201cBut that\u2019s not what\u2019s happening. Readers continue to leave print newspapers, but they\u2019re not migrating to the online editions.\u201d</p> <p>Back to the Teaxas pair: \u201c[W]hile print readership is declining, newspaper readers did <em>not </em>drop print in favour of the same newspaper\u2019s online edition. The identified performance gap between newspapers\u2019 print and online products challenges the \u2018digital first\u2019 view about the future of newspapers\u201d.</p> <p>As for the money, Chyi and Tenenboim note that US newspaper industry digital advertising revenue increased from $3bn to only $3.5bn from 2010 to 2014. </p> <p>Although print revenues plunged from $22.8bn to $16.4 bn over the same period, they still represented 82% of total newspaper revenue. </p> <p>Shafer then turns to arguments advanced by Chyi in her 2013 book, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Trial-Error-Newspapers-Inferiority-Monographs/dp/8480814446\">Trial and error: US newspapers\u2019 digital struggles toward inferiority</a>. </p> <p>She thought the online editions of newspapers offered a \u201cless-than-satisfactory\u201d reading experience that was inferior to the paid-for print version. This may explain, writes Shafer, why visits to the 51 newspaper websites don\u2019t last long.</p> <p>Chyi\u2019s advice to publishers: accept that the days of 25-35% profit margins will never return and be happy with the 5% margins common in other companies. And charge for access to online content. Why? Because it invests the content with value.</p> <p>Shafer contends that Chyi is not a Luddite: she appreciates the immediacy and convenience of getting news via computers and mobile platforms. But, writes Shafer channelling Chyi, \u201cfor all of its faults, the newspaper remains a superior format and much would be lost if our neglect caused its premature demise\u201d.</p> <p>He quotes an interview with Chyi in which she used the following analogy:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Newspaper had been running the equivalent of a very nice high-end steakhouse. Then McDonald\u2019s moved to town and started selling untold numbers of cheap hamburgers. </p> <p>Newspaper thought, \u201cLet\u2019s compete with that,\u201d and dropped the steak for hamburger, even though it had no real expertise in producing hamburgers. What they should have done is improve the steak product.</p> </blockquote> <p>She rejects the idea that the newspaper is a doomed dinosaur, saying: \u201cThere\u2019s some hope if they rethink their strategies.\u201d</p> <p>Shafer, who hopes Chyi is right because he sees \u201cconventional newspapers, for all their shortcomings\u201d as \u201cthe best source of information about the workings of our government, of industry, and of the major institutions that dominate our lives\u201d</p> <p>He writes: \u201cThey still publish a disproportionate amount of the accountability journalism available, a function that\u2019s not being fully replaced by online newcomers...</p> <p>\u201cIf we give up the print newspaper for dead, accepting its demise without a fight, we stand to lose one of the vital bulwarks that protect and sustain our culture\u201d.</p> <p>I guess many will view this as a sort of back-to-the-future kind of argument, but I\u2019ve found myself edging backwards to this position for a while. Is this digital Bolshevik now a Menshevik?</p>",

It\u2019s a love song set in a world on the brink of nuclear war. With the blackest of humor, the lyrics conflate paranoia, nihilism and lust, a troika ideally suited to the Trump gestalt. It helps that Adam features one of Ritter\u2019s best-formed folk-rock melodies, with a beauty reminiscent of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jun/29/paul-simon-retire-graceland-art-garfunkel\">Paul Simon</a>\u2019s most fluid tunes.</p> <p>James\u2019s piece has less lyrical specificity but nearly as much sonic allure.

Band leader Ben Gibbard seized on an anecdote from the first presidential debate in which the Donald claimed he started his business empire with a million dollar loan from his father. It\u2019s a spoof on both privilege and elastic truth, sung with maximum sarcasm and wariness. </p> <p>The American singer-songwriter Bhi Bhiman zeroed in on Trump\u2019s apparent one-way bromance with Vladimir Putin. Using the James Bond-inspired title With Love, From Russia, the song imagines a deal between the two politicians which has Putin taking the Baltic countries while giving Trump in return fantasy properties from Monopoly. An accompanying video surveys a painting of Trump and Putin lost in a deep kiss, as the music lurches through a flatulent synth-pop beat.</p> <p>El Vy \u2013 a project between the National\u2019s Matt Berninger and Ramona Falls\u2019 Brent Knopf \u2013 takes an equally cartoonish approach. The visuals for Are These My Jets center on a video game character named Richard Walrus, who flies a tiny plane that blows things to hell while a weeping Abraham Lincoln looks on.

Her sprightly folk-pop song Can\u2019t You Tell aims to get inside Trump\u2019s head, treating his candidacy as a joke he started that got out of control. \u201cIsn\u2019t anybody going to stop me?\u201d she has Trump poignantly ask. \u201cI don\u2019t want this job/I can\u2019t do this job/My God/ can\u2019t you tell?/I\u2019m unwell.\u201d </p> <p>Mann\u2019s song may have the best lines, and the catchiest melody, but a special award for speed should go to Franz Ferdinand for Demagogue. Just two weeks after the Access Hollywood revelation, the band managed to jam in an allusion to Trump\u2019s famous \u201cp\u201d-word outburst. The music has a Bowie-in-Berlin sturm und drang, while the video boasts artwork from Shepard Fairey. Not since Neil Young dashed off Ohio mere weeks after the Kent State shootings has a band reacted this quickly to a public event. Of course, Demagogue hasn\u2019t anywhere near the potency of Ohio. In fact, none of the snarky pieces in the project so far have the enraged genius of a song like, say, Elvis Costello\u2019s take-down of Margaret Thatcher, Tramp the Dirt Down. But in an election cycle that seems hellishly endless, these quick pricks and swipes are providing some sweet relief.</p>",

I cannot stand here and say things that I do not believe just because they are my party\u2019s policy. I am opposing this because I genuinely oppose the disproportionate invasion of privacy that ICRs represent.\u201d Only three Labour peers voted with us \u2013 I only wish the former Liberty director <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/shami-chakrabarti\" title=\"\">Shami Chakrabarti</a> had been one of them.</p> <p>There will be some who argue that threats such as terrorism and child sexual exploitation demand that we give up some of our freedoms in order to stay safe. In preparation for the debates on the bill, I visited the MI6 building in Vauxhall Cross (which didn\u2019t really get blown up in Skyfall) and GCHQ. I was told by the security and intelligence agencies they did not want and did not need ICRs in order to keep us safe. GCHQ even has a joint unit with the National Crime Agency that tackles online child sexual exploitation. Law enforcement agencies, mainly the police, claim they need ICRs, even though they do not have them now and there are serious doubts that they will be of any practical use. How then, can such a massive invasion of people\u2019s privacy be justified, when serious crime and terrorism can be successfully tackled without ICRs?</p> <p>All this will be done at huge cost to the taxpayer, at serious risk to privacy and without any certainty that it will make any of us any safer. This is just one of the powers Liberal Democrats have opposed in this draconian bill, powers that will enter into law because Labour supported them.</p>",

  "<p>Transport operators across the country can do more with the same amount of money if they have devolved control, a panel of transport experts said during a Guardian roundtable event. They did however, differ on just what the future of transport would look like. </p> <h2>Devolution will save time and money and boost accountability</h2> <p>Valerie Shawcross, deputy mayor of London for transport, said up to 10% of costs could be saved if her department were able to schedule its own projects and make autonomous decisions. She said the business case for improving the efficiency of London\u2019s rail network lies in devolving franchising powers. <br></p> <p>\u201cThere is a big efficiency agenda behind the devolution agenda. At the moment we\u2019re wasting money by waiting in line and having to keep projects on the burners,\u201d she said, adding that she wished she had a penny for every tram project that had been endlessly talked about for years but never happened.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"492dcceeec26fcdb7c5b6ae93f9e9368353836fb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/492dcceeec26fcdb7c5b6ae93f9e9368353836fb/0_0_4496_2698/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The panel took place during the Conservative party conference\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The panel took place during the Conservative party conference.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>David McNeill<strong>, </strong>director of public affairs and stakeholder engagement at Transport for London reflected on what devolved political powers can bring and said that it was clear from the capital that success is about political accountability, being subject to scrutiny and having a mandate. </p> <p>\u201cTransport for London has been a product of its own mistakes, in that our success is actually built on a number of failures and some projects which have wasted money,\u201d he admitted. \u201cBut political accountability and the relative volatility of politics in London has made us honest, and if you lose your sense of accountability, which can happen if you\u2019re a big and dominant institution, things can go quite badly wrong.\u201d</p> <h2>Local needs </h2> <p>Devolution should bring better cohesion between transport and development. The panelists discussed Crossrail 2, seeing it as not fundamentally a transport project, but a means to enable more housing and development, with transport to join that up. <br></p> <p>However, Stephen Joseph, chief executive of Campaign for Better Transport, observed that there is a historic missing link in central government between the Department for Transport and the Department for Communities and Local Government. Devolution should help to remedy that and put the passenger\u2019s experience firmly in the picture. The campaign group did a survey of passengers using Merseytravel, which is now responsible for transport coordination in the Liverpool city region. \u201cSomebody gave the feedback that when it snows, the people who manage the contract know it is snowing and they want to get home, whereas somebody in London wouldn\u2019t care,\u201d explained Joseph.</p> <p>The merits of devolution were widely discussed, but regional benefits should not come at a cost to thinking about the overall national picture, warned Philippa Oldham, head of transport and manufacturing at the Institution of Mechanical Engineers.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"e5875b22aa89157227e6064bb845c725b7214450\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e5875b22aa89157227e6064bb845c725b7214450/0_0_3684_2211/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Campaign for Better Transport\u2019s Stephen Joseph and Philipa Oldham of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Campaign for Better Transport\u2019s Stephen Joseph and Philippa Oldham of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIt\u2019s great to work on things to suit a region but we do need to make sure it still flows up to the top level and is right for the UK; an integrated transport system might help that,\u201d she said, adding that devolution should also bring opportunity to business as well as commuters. Freight is a prime example that is often overlooked. Taking freight off the road and on to the railways will free up capacity on the roads and could save a lot of money and time; this should also feed into the idea of joined-up approaches. <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://transportforthenorth.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Transport for the North</a> is doing just that and the room said they would like to see others follow suit. </p> <h2>Local issues</h2> <p>Data research in the west of England has found that six out of 10 car journeys at peak times are children being dropped off to school, according to Ben Howlett, MP for Bath. And yet the West of England partnership has not used its devolved transport powers to discuss that particular problem at all \u2013 it is wrongly viewed as a local council issue, he said. </p> <p>\u201cOne of the things which is often missed out of transport debates are the practical solutions to transport. Time and again we fail to understand the reasons why there are so many cars on the road.\u201d Paying more attention to <a href=\"http://www.sustrans.org.uk/sites/default/files/documents/srs_safe_routes_fs01.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Safe Route to School schemes</a> (pdf) is just one example of how walking and cycling to school could be normalised and peak-time traffic reduced. </p> <p>There was agreement from the room that finding practical solutions to problems like traffic pinch points in local areas should not be deflected from serious transport agendas as a \u201clocal council issue\u201d.</p> <h2>Future transport and cars</h2> <p>Attention turned to what future transport will look like. There needs to be a balance between investing in digital infrastructure as well as physical assets, said Jason Pavey, local transport director at Atkins. \u201cWe are looking at the digital side of infrastructure and how to train the future workforce, because we will need a very different workforce to the one we have now.\u201d Mobility options are changing \u2013 people are given much more choice and can access real-time information, particularly in urban areas; and that choice will only amplify with the advent of technology and innovation. </p> <p>Cars remain the most common way of getting around, and their empty seats present a big opportunity for cities. And yet carpooling schemes in London, Greater Manchester and elsewhere have been scraped by transport authorities, pointed out Ali Clabburn, chief executive of Liftshare. He\u2019d like to see the car taken more seriously. \u201cLondon\u2019s spare capacity is in car seats; the buses are full, the tubes are full, the pavements are full and there is nothing being done to encourage car pooling\u201d he said.</p> <p>But there was disagreement from some in the room on where the surplus capacity is. The deputy mayor of London for Transport said she thought the rail network was underused. \u201cIf we had a properly coordinated investment programme on the rail network in London, opened up the pinch points and dealt with short platforms in a much more coordinated way, we could deliver 25%-30% more rail capacity,\u201d she said.</p> <p>In a world that is changing very fast and becoming demand-led rather than infrastructure driven, panelists throughout the room said they felt encouraged by the willingness shown by transport authorities and experts across the country to exchange ideas and share expertise. Even if they don\u2019t always agree. </p> <h2>The panel</h2> <ul> <li><strong>Lord Ahmad of Wimbledon</strong>,<strong> </strong>parliamentary under-secretary of state for transport, Department for Transport.<br tabindex=\"-1\"><br tabindex=\"-1\"></li> <li><strong>Alex Burrow</strong><strong>s</strong>, marketing and strategy director, Alstom UK.<br><br></li> <li><strong>Ali Clabburn</strong>, chief executive, Liftshare.<br><br></li> <li><strong>Clare Cornes</strong>,<strong> </strong>transport strategist, Transport for Greater Manchester.<br><br></li> <li><strong>Andrew Crudgington</strong>, director of external affairs and strategy, Institution of Civil Engineers.<br><br></li> <li><strong>Nigel Foster</strong>, strategy director, Transport for the North.<br><br></li> <li><strong>James Heappey</strong>,<strong> </strong>MP for Wells, member of energy and climate change committee.<br tabindex=\"-1\"><br tabindex=\"-1\"></li> <li><strong>John Holland-Kaye, </strong>chief executive, Heathrow.<br><br></li> <li><strong>Ben Howlett,</strong> MP for Bath, member of petitions committee.<br tabindex=\"-1\"><br tabindex=\"-1\"></li> <li><strong>Stephen Joseph</strong>, chief executive, Campaign for Better Transport.<br><br></li> <li><strong>David McNeill, </strong>director of public affairs and stakeholder engagement, Transport for London.<br tabindex=\"-1\"><br tabindex=\"-1\"></li> <li><strong>Philippa Oldham, </strong>head of transport and manufacturing, Institution of Mechanical Engineers.<br tabindex=\"-1\"><br tabindex=\"-1\"></li> <li><strong>Jason Pavey, </strong>local transport director, Atkins.</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>John Penrose,</strong> MP for Weston-super-Mare.<br><br tabindex=\"-1\"></li> <li><strong>Valerie Shawcross</strong>, deputy mayor of London for Transport.<br><br></li> <li><strong>Sandeep Shingadia</strong>, head of programme development, Transport for West Midlands.<br tabindex=\"-1\"><br tabindex=\"-1\"></li> <li><strong>Steve Yianni</strong>, chief executive, Transport Systems Catapult.</li> </ul> <p><em>The discussion, which took place on 3 October during the Conservative party conference, was sponsored by Atkins.</em></p> <p><strong>Talk to us on Twitter via </strong><strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/guardianpublic\" rel=\"nofollow\">@Guardianpublic</a> and </strong><strong><a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/public-leaders/\">sign up</a></strong><strong> for your free weekly Guardian Public Leaders newsletter with news and analysis sent direct to you every Thursday.</strong></p>",
  "<h2>Three months and counting</h2> <p>The good news - according to the World Energy Council (WEC) - is that, per person, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/10/global-demand-for-energy-will-peak-in-2030-says-world-energy-council\">our energy demand is set to peak before 2030</a>. Of course, there will be more of us around by then too, so that total demand will only slow, rather than level out. A heady whiff of technological optimism accompanies the explanation that this will happen because of \u201cunprecedented efficiencies created by new technologies and more stringent energy policies\u201d. </p> <p>The bad news is that under the scenarios drawn up by the WEC, even keeping to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/dec/12/paris-climate-deal-key-points\">upper target agreed in Paris of global warming no greater than 2C</a> will require an \u201cexceptional and enduring effort\u201d that goes beyond any current commitments and needs a price for coal, oil and gas that is dramatically higher. </p> <p>To sweeten this pill, the WEC gives its scenarios names which must appear funky in the world of energy policy. \u201cModern jazz\u201d is about shiny, digitally driven markets, the slightly less enthusiastic \u201cUnfinished symphony\u201d is about emerging greener models for growth, while \u201cHard rock\u201d is a future of both low and grubby growth.</p> <p>The problem with these and many other scenarios that emerge in the mainstream, is the intellectual editing that occurs before they even begin. Most share two overwhelming, linked characteristics that strictly limit any subsequent room for manoeuvre. Firstly the demand for energy itself is seen as something innate, unchallengeable and unmanageable. It must be met, and the only question is how. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Secondly, the assumption remains that the principles and practices of the economic model that has dominated for the last 30 years will remain for at least the next 30 years. There is no sign yet of the ferocious challenge to neoliberal orthodoxy happening at the margins of economics shaping mainstream visions of our possible futures. The merest glance at the history of changing ideas suggests this is short-sighted.</p> <p>There are reasons why we need to get a move on with tackling energy demand. Extreme weather events abound. <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-37625055\">Record flooding</a> in North Carolina in the United States follows record flooding in <a href=\"https://www.usgs.gov/news/usgs-records-historic-flooding-south-louisiana\">Louisiana</a> earlier in the year. While no individual event can be described a direct cause and effect relationship, increasingly heavy rainfall and flood events are <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/2016/08/17/baton-rouge-floods-broke-a-record-many-thought-would-never-be-broken.html\">consistent with climate models</a> for a warming world.</p> <p>It\u2019s nearly a year on from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jan/05/december-2015-was-wettest-month-ever-recorded-in-uk\">wettest UK December</a> on record in 2015. Subsequently, work by the World Weather Attribution project estimated that the <a href=\"https://www.carbonbrief.org/qa-how-scientists-link-extreme-weather-to-climate-change\">odds for that rainfall event</a> were increased by 50-75% by climate change. </p> <p>Now, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-37565462\">insurers in the UK</a> complain that householders are failing to protect their properties from flooding, while the Environment Agency says that insurers preside over a system in which risk is simply rebuilt where flooding has already taken place. The Climate Change Committee says the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-37632620\">UK is off track</a> to meet its mid-century carbon reduction target, just as key decisions on aviation expansion and fracking look set to lock in emissions-intensive infrastructure. </p> <p>Scenarios for industrial transition are needed that tell a bolder and more convincing tale, not just of the UK meeting its international obligations that are written into treaties, but that go further and stand a genuine chance of limiting warming to 2C.</p> <p>What sort of scenarios should we be looking at then? We can learn from the impoverished Brexit debate that was marred by binary choices cloaked in wilful misinformation. For the whole population to fully understand our options, and the choices and challenges embedded in them, we should be thinking as openly and broadly as possible. We can look at how far techno-fixes will get us, and at the maximum speed and scale of change that market mechanisms and the pricing of carbon are likely to deliver. In both, the different impacts on rich and poor need assessing. </p> <p>But we should go further to assess the pros and cons of radical scenarios for changing how we live and work.</p> <p>Rarely considered but important variables come from new economics, including the shorter working week, the share economy, shifts in corporate ownership and governance, and intelligent but deliberate measures for economic localisation. Compare these to the \u201cstumble on\u201d, or business as usual scenario, in which we give up control of our future to a permanently destabilised climate change, but also assess seriously the consequences of the argument for planned so-called \u201cde-growth\u201d of the economy.</p> <p>At the height of the 2008 financial crisis, the UK government promised to <a href=\"http://www.ukpol.co.uk/2015/10/02/gordon-brown-2008-speech-on-the-global-economy-at-reuters/\">\u201cgo beyond the conventional thinking</a>\u201d to put things right. It never did, but with the climate crisis there is no choice. Conventional thinking is off-course and contradictory.</p> <p>Without a balanced, comparative assessment of strategies to align energy use and industry with inescapable climate action, we won\u2019t be able to choose the best possible future. I\u2019m glad to say that work like this is beginning to happen at places such as the University of Leeds\u2019 <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://ciemap.leeds.ac.uk/\">centre for industrial energy, materials and products</a>. It\u2019s going to mean telling better stories of change, rewriting rules and breaking ideological chains all around, but hey, that\u2019s jazz \u2026</p>",
  "<p>The rights of Irish citizens to emigrate to Britain will need to be enshrined in law if their assumed \u201cspecial status\u201d is to continue, according to legal experts.<br></p> <p>The Irish have more rights than other EU citizens in Britain because of the historical ties between the two countries, such as the right to vote and the right to stand for public office, including Westminster.</p> <p>It has been widely assumed that this comes from the special historical links between the two countries and specifically the 1949 Ireland Act, which officially ended the country\u2019s status as a British dominion.</p> <p>But Bernard Ryan, professor of migration law at Leicester University, said this was a vague statement and if it were challenged might not have much legal value. \u201cThere is some sort of political consensus and the Ireland Act has some sort of legal aspiration, but I would not say it in itself protects the rights of the Irish,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The act was designed to treat the Irish the same as Commonwealth citizens, who in 1949 had the right to emigrate to Britain. </p> <p>Irish and Commonwealth citizens were both subsequently subjected to immigration controls. In the case of Irish citizens, the controls never amounted to anything in practice as they were cancelled out by an exemption that came into force on the same day as the <a href=\"http://legislation.data.gov.uk/uksi/1972/1610/made/data.htm?wrap=true\">the immigration (control of entry through Republic of Ireland) order 1972</a>.</p> <p>This exemption, under common travel area legislation, means that to this day there is no legal requirement to show a passport when crossing the British/Irish borders, although there are rights to deport undesirables.</p> <p>Ryan is one of the few lawyers examining the unique position of Irish citizens in detail. He has been cited in a post-Brexit House of Commons briefing paper on the \u201cspecial status of Irish nationals in UK law\u201d.</p> <p>He said: \u201cThe minimum needed would be some sort of political statement on immigration and future rights of Irish citizens. But I feel in reality something has to be written into immigration legislation going forward.\u201d</p> <p>The right to vote is probably the least contentious issue as it is provided for in the Representation of the People\u2019s Act 1983 and was reciprocated by Ireland in 1984.<br></p> <p>The chances of EU citizens settled in Britain retaining all their rights to live, work and retire in the UK after Brexit have been<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/13/zero-chance-eu-citizens-keep-same-rights-post-brexit-expert\"> rated at zero by legal experts</a>.<br></p> <p>A leading barrister who specialises in international public law told a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/lords\">House of Lords</a> panel in September that it was inconceivable that the laws would survive entirely intact.<br></p> <p>Prof Alan Vaughan Lowe QC said this was the price millions of people \u2013 including 1.3 million Britons abroad and 3 million non-Britons living in the UK \u2013 were likely to pay for Brexit.</p> <p>Such was the uncertainty surrounding negotiations and the demands of other EU states, he said, that the British government might have to consider compensation for British citizens abroad if some rights, such as access to Spanish or French healthcare, were lost.<br></p> <p>But Lowe told the Lords\u2019 justice subcommittee that what worried him most was the lack of knowledge about the issue at government level. \u201cThere is very little evidence of people knowing what they are trying to do,\u201d he said.<br></p>",

For Clinton, it\u2019s the hacking of her campaign chairman\u2019s emails; for Trump, it\u2019s the accusations of sexual assault. </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/19/donald-trump-and-hillary-clinton-face-fear-and-loathing-at-third-debate\">Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton face fear and loathing at third debate</a></p> <h2>Trump\u2019s bleak electoral math</h2> <p>In three crucial states \u2013 Nevada, North Carolina and Ohio \u2013 the contest between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump remains close, according to polling data released by CNN/ORC, yet the electoral map is looking increasingly bleak for Trump. Arizona, for example, which has consistently voted Republican in all but one of the past 10 presidential elections, is in effect tied. Yesterday, Clinton\u2019s campaign announced a $6m advertising push in these three key battleground states as well as Florida, Pennsylvania, Iowa and New Hampshire. Meanwhile, Trump says he\u2019ll impose congressional term limits to \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/18/donald-trump-congress-term-limits-clinton-final-debate\">drain the Washington swamp</a>\u201d.

  "<p>In Monday night\u2019s game 3 of the AL Championship Series, Cleveland Indians pitcher Trevor Bauer had to make an early exit after his injured pinkie refused to stop gushing blood. In Massachusetts, the gory sight conjured up surprisingly positive memories: it was hard not to think back to Curt Schilling\u2019s starts in game 6 of the 2004 ALCS and game 2 of the World Series. Pitching on a surgically repaired ankle with blood dripping through thick socks, the Red Sox ace stayed in the game, mowing down the offenses of the New York Yankees and then the St Louis Cardinals on the way towards the team\u2019s first championship in 86 years.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/11/david-ortiz-big-papi-retires-boston-red-sox\">The Red Sox say goodbye to Big Papi, and Boston will never be the same</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Schilling, in essence, was sacrificing his body, risking his entire career, to deliver New England a World Series title many thought they would never live to see. It was such a vivid drama that it could have been the climax of a particularly cringe-worthy Kevin Costner movie, so much so that there remain baseball fans who still believe it was faked. To see Bauer in action was, for Massachusetts residents, to be reminded of the old Curt Schilling, the Schilling who made such a memorable sacrifice to such long-suffering fans.</p> <p>It was easily the most defining moment in Schilling\u2019s remarkable playing career. So, yesterday, with his 2004 heroics <a href=\"http://www.sportsnet.ca/baseball/mlb/francona-making-right-moves-cleveland-keeps-rolling/\">returning to public consciousness</a>, Schilling decided it was the perfect time to make his announcement. \u201cI\u2019ve made my decision,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/18/curt-schilling-elizabeth-warren-massachusetts-state-senate\">he said</a> to Boston radio station WRKO, confirming talk that he would run for Senate in 2018, presumably against sitting senator Elizabeth Warren. He did give himself an out, however: \u201cI haven\u2019t talked to Shonda, my wife. And ultimately it\u2019s going to come down to how we feel about our marriage and our kids.\u201d</p> <p>There was a time when the notion of Senator Curt Schilling (R-MA) <a href=\"http://deadspin.com/curt-schilling-for-what-feels-like-the-hundredth-time-1787928947?utm_campaign=socialflow_deadspin_twitter&amp;utm_source=deadspin_twitter&amp;utm_medium=socialflow\">seemed like it was possible</a>. In 2009, while still basking in the glow of his Red Sox heroics, his name was bandied about as the Republican candidate in the 2010 special election to replace the late Ted Kennedy. He demurred, saying it wasn\u2019t his time, and the Republicans nominated moderate Scott Brown, who eventually beat out Democratic candidate Martha Coakley on 19 January 2010.</p> <p>Instead of politics, Schilling was deep into video game developing. In 2011 he moved the company he founded, 38 Studios, from Massachusetts to Rhode Island after securing $75m of taxpayer money. 38 Studios <a href=\"http://www.bostonmagazine.com/2012/07/38-studios-end-game/\">went bust in 2012</a>, a debacle that resulted in a lawsuit filed by Rhode Island, since settled and a fraud investigation by the Rhode Island state police.</p> <p>Following the failure of 38 Studios, Schilling focused on broadcasting. It went better than his time in gaming, only in that he didn\u2019t make an enemy out of an entire US state this time around. During a stint with ESPN, when Schilling wasn\u2019t <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://deadspin.com/espn-suspends-keith-law-from-twitter-for-defending-evol-1661836868\">arguing with co-workers</a> about evolution, he was using his down time to share increasingly controversial political views and offensive cartoons, most notoriously one comparing <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2015/aug/26/curt-schilling-espn-twitter-mlb\">Muslims and Nazis</a>. This led to a lengthy suspension, during which he was forced to defend his own <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.sportingnews.com/mlb/news/curt-schilling-nazi-world-war-ii-collection-muslim-tweet-espn-suspension/y25n11fae8l11tygm6h64tv7\">Nazi memorabilia collection</a>. His return didn\u2019t last too long. In April of this year, one final meme, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/apr/20/espn-fires-curt-schilling-transgender-facebook-comments\">this one highly transphobic,</a> ended his tenure at ESPN permanently.</p> <p>This <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2016/apr/21/curt-schilling-espn-firing-baseball-transphobia\">overdue termination</a>, and his subsequent embrace of his new role of truth-telling conservative martyr, victim of the PC police, hastened his full plunge into politics. The transition hasn\u2019t gone smoothly, even as the political bar for acceptable discourse has plummeted to unfathomable new depths. Most recently, Schilling was defending Donald Trump\u2019s habit of flirting with pre-teens in a way that was creepy even by Trump surrogate standards.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEHCK9Q-6jI\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/xEHCK9Q-6jI?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>If Schilling makes good on his decision to run for the US Senate, he will till have a significant group of core supporters. The problem is that things like calling for <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/early-lead/wp/2016/09/19/curt-schillings-solution-for-terrorism-executions-without-trial/\">\u201ca version of the Berlin Wall\u201d</a> on the Mexican border, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://mediamatters.org/blog/2015/08/25/espn-analyst-curt-schillings-worst-facebook-pos/205146\">equating Islam straight up with terrorism</a> aren\u2019t going to play very well in heavily liberal-leaning Massachusetts, no matter how many great memories voters have of him striking out Alex Rodriguez.</p> <p>At this point in his life, Schilling is a failed broadcaster and a businessman who, through either incompetence or deceit, has already screwed over one state in New England. He has gained no specific political experience since he declined to run in 2009 \u2013 unless you count his time spent as an unpaid racist meme curator. He\u2019s Trump without without the smarmy charisma that allows Trump to skate away from scandal far more intact than he has any right to be. Instead, Schilling is something more basic. Schilling\u2019s <a href=\"https://theringer.com/curt-schilling-political-aspirations-9f32bc426c4b#.grozglwry\">that one uncle on Facebook</a>, just with three World Series rings and access to multiple media outlets.</p> <p>Scott Brown managed to pull off his special election victory back in 2009 for two reasons. First, Brown, a Republican, was able to position himself as a moderate who appealed to a broad range of voters, an avenue thoroughly closed off to Schilling at this point. Secondly, he was running against a candidate in Martha Coakley who drew lukewarm water levels of enthusiasm, even among registered Democrats. It also didn\u2019t help that she inexplicably called Schilling a \u201cYankees fan\u201d during her 2009 campaign (this may end up being Schilling\u2019s biggest positive contribution to Massachusetts GOP history.)</p> <p>Warren, who defeated Brown in the 2012, makes a formidable opponent for any GOP candidate to face \u2013 partly because her supporters are so passionate. Warren was popular enough (a <a href=\"https://morningconsult.com/senate-approval-bernie-rubio-cruz/\">61% popularity rating</a>, according to one recent poll) that there was recent talk that Clinton was considering her as her vice-president. This was opposed by many liberals, not because she would be unsuited for the job, but because they considered her too important <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2016/06/13/vp_does_not_make_sense_for_elizabeth_warren_130860.html\">to remove from the Senate</a>. In short, Schilling v Warren could end up being an absolute bloodbath. A <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://boston.cbslocal.com/2016/09/30/elizabeth-warren-curt-schilling-senate-poll-2018-president/\">recent poll</a> showed Warren holding a 19-point lead over Schilling in a hypothetical election.</p> <p>It\u2019s tempting to say that there\u2019s absolutely no way that Schilling would actually become the GOP nominee, it would be tantamount to party suicide. But after this presidential election, it is foolish to assume that this is the case. In a sane and just world, this wouldn\u2019t end up being anything other than a one-time local hero burning through the last of his goodwill on yet another hopeless scheme. But that might not be the type of world we currently inhabit.</p>",

  "<p>This week in Quito as many as 45,000 people have gathered for Habitat III, the global UN summit which, every 20 years, resets the world\u2019s urban agenda. </p> <p>Why should we care? Well, to start with, in the next 20 years, we will witness more than two billion more people moving to cities. Depending on what we do to accommodate them, this could be good \u2013 or very bad \u2013 news. </p> <p>It\u2019s good news because people are demonstrably better off in cities than outside them. For the poor, cities are efficient vehicles to satisfy basic needs. Having people in a concentrated space makes the implementation of public policies more effective (think of access to sanitation, and the consequences for reducing child mortality and epidemic disease).</p> <p>For the middle class, meanwhile, cities are a concentration of opportunities for jobs, education, healthcare and even recreation. They offer the promise of social mobility. And for a certain elite, cities are a powerful vehicle to create wealth; their critical mass generates the appropriate environment for knowledge creation and prosperity in the broadest sense of the word. </p> <p>In short, cities are like magnets, with the potential to take care of everything from the most basic needs to the most intangible desires.</p> <p>Now for the bad news, which we could call the \u201c3S menace\u201d. The scale and speed of this global urbanisation, and the scarcity of means with which we must respond to it, has no precedents in human history. </p> <p>Of the three billion urban dwellers today, one billion live below the poverty line. In two decades\u2019 time, five billion people will be in cities, with two billion of them below the poverty line. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"301b4af3d0a5d623f2ba809e127ebbee1af7e475\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/301b4af3d0a5d623f2ba809e127ebbee1af7e475/0_60_3000_1802/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A \u2018half house\u2019 by Chilean architect Alejandro Aravena.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"601\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A \u2018half house\u2019 by Chilean architect Alejandro Aravena.

If we don\u2019t solve this equation, it\u2019s not that people will stop coming to cities; they will still come, but they will live in awful conditions.</p> <p>What\u2019s at stake here is not just poverty but inequality too. Cities express in a very concrete and direct way the distance between the haves and have-nots.</p> <p>Urban inequalities are often reflected in brutal ways \u2013 from the distance people must travel to work every day, to the lack of quality public spaces, urban amenities and civic services. No wonder so much anger and resentment is accumulated in the peripheries. </p> <p>Of course, this is problem is not exclusive to developing countries. Rich countries, despite having solved all their basic needs, experience a similar accumulation of social pressure as if it was a ticking time bomb.</p> <h2>A way to grow</h2> <p>To add one more level of complexity to the phenomenon of urbanisation, even if we do eventually find a way to build for that extra million people each week, we will go into environmental crisis, such is the carbon footprint of today\u2019s construction process. </p> <p>This would not only be a \u201cgreen\u201d problem, but a major security threat too. According to a report by the US defence department, the next conflicts, wars and terrorist threats will be triggered by climate change.</p> <p>There is a one-to-one correlation between zones of military conflict and a global map of water drought. This not only creates problems in the afflicted countries but also migrations towards less-affected areas, adding to the social pressure in the countries of destination too.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video element--supporting\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/video/2016/jun/16/built-my-own-social-housing-chile-half-houses-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/4y4ey\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2542422\"            data-video-name=\"I built my own social housing: the rise of Chile's 'half-houses' \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57602600e4b005ab05d20e91\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/06/15/150614HWLNChileNEW_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/06/15/150614HWLNChileNEW_synd_768k_vp8.webm\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2016/06/15/150614HWLNChileNEW_large.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/06/15/150614HWLNChileNEW.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2016/06/15/150614HWLNChileNEW_small.3gp\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/video/2016/jun/16/built-my-own-social-housing-chile-half-houses-video\">I built my own social housing: the rise of Chile\u2019s \u2018half-houses\u2019</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>These are the kind of challenges that needed to be addressed at Habitat III. Fortunately, an appeal by Dr Joan Clos, the executive director of UN Habitat appointed by Ban Ki Moon to guide the event, already carries a promising approach. </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/apr/18/lost-science-building-cities-joan-clos-un-habitat\">Clos\u2019s framing of the problem</a> can be synthesised like this: we need to invert the way we view the relationship between economic development and good cities.</p> <p>The current approach is: first a country creates wealth. Once that is achieved, good cities will follow automatically, becoming a kind of passive outcome of economic development.</p> <p>Clos\u2019s task has instead been to convince the world\u2019s mayors (and development experts, and ministers of finance) that good cities can be a <em>source</em> of development, rather than the other way around. This reframing, and what results from it, can be summarised as follows \u2026</p> <p><em>Lesson 1: good cities may be the source, instead of the passive outcome, of economic development</em></p> <p>For this inversion of the paradigm to take place, however, you need three things: the right rule of law, the right financial plan and the right design. Imagine the mayor of City X in a rather poor country (which is, of course, where the majority of future urbanisation will take place). He or she may look out of their window and see an informal settlement growing by the hour.</p> <p>Regarding the rule of law: in this settlement, property rights are unclear, so the shacks that actually cost quite a bit of money cannot have a \u201cparallel life as capital\u201d, as the economist Hernando de Soto puts it. Regarding the financing: there is only one source \u2013 people\u2019s own resources. And regarding design: there is no access to sanitation, so no clean water nor sewerage system.</p> <p>There is no creation of value here, merely expense. The proportion between public and private space in such spontaneous urbanisation is invariably less than 1:10. Evidence shows that only when this ratio is close to 1:1 can one expect some value gain for residents (Manhattan is the ultimate example of this). . In such cases, each individual action not only gains individual value but also adds to the common good. In a slum, individual interventions, however well intentioned, cannot guarantee that.</p> <p><em>Lesson 2: the scarcest resource in cities is not money, but coordination</em></p> <p>There is one good side to the informality of the city growing outside the mayor\u2019s window. Since it is spontaneous, there is no <a href=\"http://www.useful-community-development.org/zoning-regulations.html\">zoning regulation</a> (a kind of fundamental truth of planning). Instead, we can expect a richly mixed fledgling city, where residential, businesses, retail services and productive activities all coexist together.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"98c9eb23f1e4655eb863874dbcff163a2bf2e86b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/98c9eb23f1e4655eb863874dbcff163a2bf2e86b/0_0_2362_2231/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The interior of a \u2018half house\u2019 by Aravena, before and after.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"945\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The interior of a \u2018half house\u2019 by Aravena, before and after.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tadeuz Jalocha</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><em>Lesson 3: a certain urban intensity is desirable</em></p> <p>Now our mayor ponders: what can I do with an annual budget of just $6 per inhabitant to invest in this new city? Once again, this financial plan has only one source: a state with scarce resources. Such a limited budget may force our mayor to transform agricultural land into urban land, adding to the already underserved peripheries and expanding the sprawl.</p> <p> The mayor will likely devote only a very small area to public space (as little as 20%) so more land can be dedicated to accommodating the mass of people that are pressing to be given a house. Zoning regulations will very likely be applied, resulting in a separation of functions and a very low urban intensity. Finally, since the tight budget won\u2019t allow to build \u201cmiddle-class standard\u201d housing units, evidence shows that as much as 50% of the built environment will be self-built all the same (despite, not thanks to, the design of the units).</p> <p>Facing this adverse scenario, a private real-estate developer may approach the mayor of City X and request, say, 20 hectares of land to build a housing project. And the mayor, spotting the opportunity for someone else to take care of his housing headache, may make a counter-offer: that the project will only be approved on the condition the developer actually takes 40 hectares of land.</p> <p>Naturally the developer will agree, then proceed as usual: property rights will be secured and zoning regulations complied with, resulting in low urban intensity. The financing plan will still depend on one source \u2013 this time private capital, which will look for a two-digit return in a short period of time.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The crucial point here is to secure the 'void' of the future city</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Such a miserly way of investing will dedicate as little area as possible to public space (again, as little as 20%) in order to maximise the area that can be sold. The developer may add some meandering streets to make the urban footprint more appealing, and some decoration to the tiny units. But design-wise, the contribution of the private market will be like putting lipstick on a gorilla. </p> <p>So, what to do? Perhaps the mayor of City X has come to Quito looking for clues, ideas and tips. And one could be to join up the forces of the (poor) state and the (mediocre) developer, without expecting either of them to change their nature. </p> <p>Rather than giving away a whole slab of land as a closed package, the mayor could instead partition the area the developer is asking for, then create reserves of public space between the lots: ecological corridors with a civic standard the developer would never be incentivised to deliver.</p> <p>The developer would then follow his usual model, adding a further 20% of public space \u2013 so that, overall, the project now possesses a much more liveable 40% of public space.</p> <p>For this scheme, the financial plan now has two sources: state funding, to take care of the public space and eventually some urban services too, and private funding, which looks after the urbanisation and some public space as well. Such a development will still have low urban intensity, but the higher ratio of public space may open it up to some value gain in future.</p> <p>The crucial point here is to secure the \u201cvoid\u201d of the future city. The quality of its residents\u2019 future mobility, for example, will depend on the quality of the space we reserve in between the buildings.</p> <p><em>Lesson 4: in a \u201cgood\u201d city, what is not built </em><em>is more important </em><em>than what is</em></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/nov/20/rethink-role-language-architecture-alejandro-aravena\">It's time to rethink the entire role and language of architecture</a> </p> </aside>  <p>An even greater disruption from the predictable, mediocre norm would be for the state and the market to join forces with people\u2019s own resources.</p> <p>To allow the inclusion of a third source in the financial plan, the design has to be an open one. The starting point would be the same as the previous one: public space reserved between the conventional real estate. But the developer should then be required leave 50% of the lots <em>not built</em>.</p> <p>In such a scheme, these voids are intended to channel people\u2019s own initiative \u2013 and, consequently, their resources. Property rights will be secured, but the \u201cporosity\u201d of the structures allows them to be customised, and leaves room for a higher level of urban intensity in the future. The process of reaching a middle-class standard through self-construction will happen thanks to the design, not despite of it.</p> <p><em>Lesson 5: people\u2019s own building capacity is part of the solution, not the problem</em></p> <p>As Habitat III draws to a close this week, I wonder whether by 2036, when the next Habitat conference comes around, Clos\u2019s \u201cparadigm shift\u201d will have gained traction among decision-makers. I hope the real-estate world will have moved from its current, standard two-digit return to a (fair enough) one-digit return which prioritises predictability over profitability in the way developers invest in cities.</p> <ul> <li><em>Alejandro Aravena is the director of the 2016 Venice Architecture Biennale and executive director of <a href=\"http://www.elementalchile.cl/en/\">Elemental</a>.

  "<p>Behind a locked door in York Minster, 100 stone steps spiral up to the door of the bell chamber. A second key is needed to enter the room, revealing spectacular views over the city and surrounding countryside. At its centre hang thick ropes leading up to 14 bells, with the heaviest weighing in at three tonnes.</p> <p>It was in this chamber that the minster\u2019s volunteer campanologists regularly gathered to make music, exercising a creative skill that was regarded by many as the best in the country.<br></p> <p>But that all <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/oct/13/york-minster-to-fall-silent-after-sacking-bellringers-for-whom-the-bell-tolls\">ended last Tuesday</a>, when the 30-strong bellringing team was summoned at short notice to a meeting which blew the lid off the tensions that been simmering for months within the walls of the 15th-century cathedral.<br></p> <p>According to bellringers\u2019 accounts, those present were abruptly told they were being sacked. A few minutes were allowed for questions, then letters were handed to the assembled men and women, some of whom had been members of the York Minster Society of Change Ringers for decades.<br></p> <p>The minster\u2019s famous bells would be silent forthwith. A new team of volunteers under a paid head bellringer was to be recruited in the new year. Those present were welcome to reapply. The reasons for the move were given as health and safety and risk management.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ab4c50b9fe01a4ea20768220206fff254a2423fd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ab4c50b9fe01a4ea20768220206fff254a2423fd/0_0_4256_2832/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bells at York Minster\" width=\"1000\" height=\"665\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bells at York Minster.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>By the time the meeting was over, the locks to the tower had already been changed, even though all the numbered keys were held by the eight-strong force of York Minster police and only handed to bellringers on request. (York Minster is one of only seven churches in the world to have a dedicated police force.)<br></p> <p>The shocked ringers say they offered to go to the tower to change the bells\u2019 position from up to down, safer for a period of abeyance. Their offer was declined; the next day the minster brought in a specialist from <a href=\"http://www.taylorbells.co.uk/web/\">Taylor\u2019s Bell Foundry</a> in Loughborough to do the job for a substantial fee.<br></p> <p>The news of the bellringers\u2019 dismissal caused an outcry. Dave Taylor, the lord mayor of York, <a href=\"http://www.yorkpress.co.uk/news/14797332.MINSTER_BELLS__Archbishop_holds_press_call_in_cathedral_as_15_000_sign_petition_UPDATED__1_55pm__Monday/\">described the move</a> as \u201cshocking and unreasonable\u201d and York Central MP Rachael Maskell said it had been \u201cdisproportionate\u201d. Some of the bellringers expressed anger and dismay on social media, and messages of support poured in from around the country.<br></p> <p>Six days after the meeting, John Sentamu, the archbishop of York and the second most senior person in the Church of England, held a press conference at which he disclosed that a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/17/york-minster-bellringers-sacking-was-on-safeguarding-grounds\">safeguarding issue lay behind the mass dismissal</a>.<br></p> <p>Reading a statement from the minster\u2019s governing body, the Chapter of York, Sentamu said: \u201cEarlier this summer it was necessary for the chapter to take action regarding a member of the bellringing community on safeguarding grounds. This came after complex multi-agency activity involving the City of York council, York diocese safeguarding adviser and the Church of England\u2019s national safeguarding officer.\u201d<br></p> <p>Since then, some campanologists had \u201cconsistently challenged the chapter\u2019s authority on this and other important matters\u201d, he added. Decisive action had been required. \u201cThis is why the chapter took the decision to disband the bellringing team last week.\u201d<br></p> <p>Few of the people closely involved in the drama were willing to speak on the record this week. But accounts from both sides suggest that the dispute centres on David Potter, a leading figure in the bellringing team who has been the subject of two police investigations following allegations made in 1999 and 2015. On neither occasion were charges brought.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"82f30c6630bf8f5ade3e3161761527ccbb94bb0e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/82f30c6630bf8f5ade3e3161761527ccbb94bb0e/0_0_4256_2832/1000.jpg\" alt=\"David Potter at York Minster\" width=\"1000\" height=\"665\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">David Potter at York Minster.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In January 2000, days after Potter had been awarded an MBE for bellringing services over three decades, <a href=\"http://www.yorkpress.co.uk/news/7959851.Bell_ringer_faces_indecency_probe/?ref=arc\">he was suspended</a> as ringing master at York Minster and from his job as a teacher after claims of indecent assault. The following month, the police said <a href=\"http://www.yorkpress.co.uk/news/7959015.Potter__indecent_assault___case_dropped/?ref=arc\">he would not be charged</a>.<br></p> <p>Last year, Potter was the subject of another police investigation. \u201cIn June 2015 North Yorkshire police applied for a sexual risk order following concerns raised during multi-agency safeguarding processes about a 66-year-old York man and his contact with children,\u201d the force said in a statement.<br></p> <p>\u201cThe order was initially granted by York magistrates court on an interim basis pending final determination. Ultimately the court refused to grant a sexual risk order, but other safeguarding measures were put in place by other authorities.\u201d<br></p> <p>Despite the court\u2019s conclusion, senior officials at the minster are understood to have read testimonies and other material which led them to conclude that steps needed to be taken.</p> <p>The Church of England, conscious of its past failures regarding survivors of sexual abuse, is determined to do better in protecting children, young people and vulnerable adults. Whereas in the past allegations of abuse were often ignored, dismissed or covered up, the church now favours swift action where it feels it is appropriate.</p> <p>In July, Potter was excluded by York Minster from its team of volunteer bellringers on safeguarding grounds. Potter could not be reached for comment, but <a href=\"http://www.yorkpress.co.uk/news/14809105.York_Minster_Bells__Man_at_centre_of_safeguarding_concerns_is_named/\">his solicitor has been quoted</a> as saying \u201cthe process that he has been subject to has shown a disregard for due process and equally the treatment of his fellow bellringers\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bb0af6c3bb622a78b9aaed60fd8a85be44e5eb84\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bb0af6c3bb622a78b9aaed60fd8a85be44e5eb84/0_0_4256_2832/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Inside York Minster\" width=\"1000\" height=\"665\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Inside York Minster.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Other members of the bellringing team rallied round their former captain. Some say there followed an attempt to frustrate the church\u2019s safeguarding efforts, particularly by members of Potter\u2019s extended family, who form the core of the team of bellringers.<br></p> <p>As ranks closed, the minster authorities were forced to act to regain control of the bell tower. It was in the hands of a \u201cfiefdom\u201d, said one church insider.<br></p> <p>On the other side of the bitter dispute, Potter\u2019s supporters accuse the minster\u2019s dean, Vivienne Faull, of being a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/14/volunteer-york-minster-bellringer-vents-his-anger-over-sacking\">\u201ccontrol freak\u201d</a> \u2013 although she is highly regarded within the church for her competence, energy, warmth and honesty.</p> <p>Potter\u2019s friends say both allegations were found to be groundless. \u201cThese days all you have to say is that someone touched you 20 years ago. Everyone\u2019s absolutely petrified. You can easily become a sitting target,\u201d said one.</p> <p>The friend said the bellringers were \u201cclose-knit group, but not secretive or closed \u2013 there are no funny handshakes. They\u2019ve always welcomed new ringers, although you have to choose carefully so they\u2019re cautious about who they let in.\u201d<br></p> <p>Teaching bellringing involves physical proximity. \u201cThe learner is encompassed physically while learning to pull the ropes. Navigating the accepted limits and boundaries of physical contact can be difficult,\u201d said one vicar who has had to deal with safeguarding issues within his bellringing team.<br></p> <p>Between 30,000 and 40,000 bellringers operate in about 5,000 churches in the UK, according to Kate Flavell of the <a href=\"http://www.cccbr.org.uk\">Central Council of Church Bell Ringers</a>. It takes about 10 hours to learn the basic technique \u201cbut a long time \u2013 years \u2013 to perfect it\u201d, she said. Some bellringers became \u201cwild enthusiasts\u201d, practising in different churches every night of the week, she added.<br></p> <p>In York, the bells will remain silent until a new ringing team is in place. A week after the dismissals, more than 16,000 people had signed a <a href=\"https://you.38degrees.org.uk/petitions/allow-the-york-minster-bell-ringers-to-ring\">petition</a> urging the minster to permit the sacked ringers to ring the bells on Remembrance Sunday and at Christmas.<br></p> <p>A former ringing master, <a href=\"http://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/news/ding-dong-in-the-bell-tower-york-minster-axed-ringers-on-safeguarding-grounds-1-8185622\">Peter Sanderson, accused the chapter</a> of \u201cdoublespeak [that] would hardly be out of place in George Orwell\u2019s most famous work\u201d.<br></p> <p>Meanwhile, a spokesperson for the minster said: \u201cWe remain committed to embedding a strong safeguarding culture across the minster despite the protests that have resulted from our actions.\u201d<br></p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 20 October 2016. An earlier version said that York Minster and St Peter\u2019s Basilica at the Vatican are the only churches in the world to have dedicated police forces.

  "<p>A border is a question. In fact, a border poses a whole series of implied questions; such as \u201ccan you cross me?\u201d, \u201cwill you cross me?\u201d, \u201cwhat am I doing here in the first place?\u201d and maybe most importantly: \u201cWill <em>you</em> be someone else on the other side?\u201d<br></p> <p>Writers relish questions. They\u2019re what propel narratives, for one thing, but more importantly, I believe good books are themselves sprawling, messy questions, tens of thousands of words long.<br></p> <p>And borders are especially intriguing to writers, I think, because they are the physical representation of liminality \u2013 the threshold between different (literal and metaphorical) states. Since so much writing is about change, it\u2019s endlessly fascinating to look at the indefinable moment when one thing becomes another. (And of course, there\u2019s the negative to this: when a border is impossible to cross, when we are trapped, unable to be where we want to be or <em tabindex=\"-1\">who</em> we want to be.)

Just west of Ju\u00e1rez, in the Colonia de Anapra, the 20ft-high composite fence of wire and steel plate runs out. Here, at some imprecise spot, Mexican sand becomes US sand.

  "<p>On the outskirts of Charlotte, it\u2019s the last day of early voting for the congressional race in North Carolina\u2019s 12th district at the Mountain Island library, and there are no lines for the polling stations.</p> \n<p>Instead, volunteers outnumbered the voters. It was early voting time, but not for a race nearly as high-profile as the presidential election. Only <a href=\"http://apps.meckboe.org/Pages/Election/EarlyVoting/2016JunePri.htm\">266</a> people turned out in June to the polls to pick the district\u2019s next member of Congress. After the election, once all the votes were tallied, only 7% of more than 500,000 registered voters cast ballots.</p> \n<p>\u201cTurnout was very, very low,\u201d said Carol Johnson, a poll worker and an employee for the city of Charlotte. \u201cMaybe people didn\u2019t know. Maybe they weren\u2019t interested.\u201d</p> \n<p>Or maybe people have grown disenfranchised after living in what has long been considered the most gerrymandered district in the United States. Twenty-five years ago, North Carolina lawmakers drew the 12th district, creating the second majority-minority district in a state with a dark history of denying black residents their voting rights.</p> \n<p>That line-drawing is what is known as gerrymandering, or manipulating the boundaries of electoral districts to favor a particular result.</p> \n<p>The district\u2019s borders were long and narrow \u2013 so stretched out that it took a two-hour drive from Charlotte, passing through Winston-Salem and Greensboro, before ending in Durham. Naturally, it became known as the I-85 district because, as state representative Mickey Michaux, a Democrat from Durham, once put it: \u201cIf you drove down the interstate with both car doors open, you\u2019d kill most of the people in the district.\u201d </p> \n<p>What gerrymandering can kill is the impact of a person\u2019s vote. North Carolina is a prime example of why Barack Obama and former US attorney general Eric Holder recently <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/10/obama-holder-redistricting-gerrymandering-229868\">announced plans</a> to launch a long-term redistricting reform effort. And after Donald Trump escalated his warnings that this year\u2019s presidential election is rigged, <a href=\"https://t.co/5Qc0l9wnei\">several</a> <a href=\"http://billmoyers.com/story/real-way-2016-election-rigged/\">commentators</a> and even the Daily Show\u2019s <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/08/09/trevor-noah-trump-is-right-the-2016-election-is-rigged-in-favor-of-republicans.html\">Trevor Noah</a> argued that gerrymandering along with <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/18/donald-trump-volunteer-election-observers-voter-intimidation\">voter suppression laws</a> are the real rigging.</p> \n<p>The state\u2019s past two presidential races were determined by a margin of two percentage points, yet the simple act of map-drawing distorted electoral outcomes on the ballot. Two years ago, more than half the state\u2019s voters cast Democratic ballots, yet Republicans secured the vast majority of congressional seats. For proof of gerrymandering\u2019s chilling effects, look no further than the way that the 12th \u2013 which over the years has been described as a serpentine, political pornography and nothing \u201cnatural on this planet\u201d \u2013 has undercut the power of a single vote.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/10/nc-gerrymandering-map/\" data-alt=\"Party control of line-drawing\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/10/nc-gerrymandering-map/\">Party control of line-drawing</a> \n <figcaption>\n  Party control of line-drawing\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Opponents of gerrymandering fear the voices of voters may be washed out in the upcoming presidential election, even as statewide restrictions that have been intensively litigated pose potentially more direct obstacles to voting.</p> \n<p>This coming term, the US supreme court will review the long-running battle over line-drawing. </p> \n<h2>\u2018An uncomfortable resemblance to political apartheid\u2019</h2> \n<p>The most gerrymandered district emerged after years of battles against discriminatory voting practices. In the decades after the landmark Voting Rights Act of 1965 outlawed voting restrictions such as literacy tests, voting rights lawyers continued to challenge discriminatory election practices still on the books in southern states \u2013 forcing changes to ensure their compliance with the Voting Rights Act.<br></p> \n<p>Over the course of several decades, North Carolina\u2019s population grew enough to gain a 12th congressional seat following the 1990 census. The 12th, the state\u2019s second majority-minority district, was intended to boost minority representation.</p> \n<p>Mel Watt, a black Charlotte-based lawyer and political operative, seized on the opportunity. He had helped Harvey Gantt get elected as Charlotte\u2019s first black mayor in the early 80s. </p> \n<p>\u201cI got on the phone to call Harvey,\u201d hoping to persuade him to run, Watt recalls. \u201cHe said, \u2018I\u2019m not going to run.\u2019 He instead talked me into running.\u201d</p> \n<p>Watt won in 1992, and then more than 10 times after that in the majority black district. But during his tenure, the US supreme court took issue with the district\u2019s consideration of race in its line-drawing numerous times.</p> \n<p>In 1993, then Justice Sandra Day O\u2019Connor said districts such as the 12th \u2013 which was drawn by the Democratic-led house \u2013 bore \u201can uncomfortable resemblance to political apartheid\u201d that reinforced the \u201cvery patterns of racial bloc voting that majority-minority districting is sometimes said to counteract.\u201d</p> \n<p>North Carolina soon found itself in a bind: it needed to ensure black votes actually mattered, all while drawing districts without explicitly having race in mind. The supreme court\u2019s Shaw v Reno ruling sparked lawsuits that challenged the constitutionality of majority-minority districts in Georgia, Texas, Florida and Louisiana. The 12th district\u2019s map had to be redrawn repeatedly, a total of four times, through 2010.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom element--supporting\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"a0abf86a-cf7d-402f-a24a-7e2898260047\" data-atom-type=\"explainer\"> \n  <div>\n   <figure class=\"element element-explainer element-atom\" data-display-type=\"flat\"> \n    <h1>How will the election be decided? </h1> \n    <div>\n     <p>The president is chosen through the electoral college, in which each state is assigned a \n      <gu-note title=\"Vicky Frost 22/9/2016 at 12:21\" data-note-edited-by=\"Vicky Frost\" data-note-edited-date=\"2016-09-22T11:21:30.549Z\" data-click-action=\"collapse\" data-note-id=\"80ca109a-7c23-445f-d54c-9ce6f6ccc7e6\" class=\"note note--start note--end\">\n       \u200bcertain \n      </gu-note>\u200bnumber of \n      <gu-note class=\"note note--start note--end\" data-note-edited-by=\"Vicky Frost\" data-note-edited-date=\"2016-09-22T11:18:42.316Z\" data-click-action=\"collapse\" data-note-id=\"b36c395a-1920-42b2-b57b-faa721b9d586\" title=\"Vicky Frost 22/9/2016 at 12:18\">\n       \u200bvotes called \n      </gu-note>\u200belectoral votes&nbsp;(EVs)\n      <gu-note class=\"note note--start note--end\" data-note-edited-by=\"Vicky Frost\" data-note-edited-date=\"2016-09-22T11:13:04.426Z\" data-click-action=\"collapse\" data-note-id=\"a3e31fdb-e028-4a34-e986-31a419d7747e\" title=\"Vicky Frost 22/9/2016 at 12:13\">\n       \u200b.

As the districts changed, North Carolina lawmakers also passed new restrictions that prohibited voters from registering on election day and required IDs to cast ballots. The US supreme court struck down a key provision of the Voting Rights Act, further gutting election laws in the Tar Heel State.</p> \n<p>With new GOP-drawn borders, Republicans in 2012 won nine of the state\u2019s 13 congressional seats even though Democrats cast more votes statewide. Two years later, Republicans picked up an additional seat despite the fact more Democrats were registered to vote.</p> \n<p>The Rev William Barber, the preacher behind the left-leaning Moral Monday movement, criticized the GOP-backed plan for containing \u201capartheid voting districts \u201d that were designed to disenfranchise African-American voters. \u201cApartheid is not the way for our representatives to be elected,\u201d said civil rights lawyer Adam Stein earlier this year at an NAACP press conference. \u201cNorth Carolina citizens have been put into districts because of their race rather than where they live.\u201d</p> \n<p>There had long been calls to remove politics from the redistricting process. Last year three state lawmakers \u2013 a Democrat and two Republicans \u2013 dropped separate bills that were ultimately unsuccessful. State representative Jeff Jackson, a Democrat and the author of one of those measures, says he nearly copied word-for-word an old Republican bill from its days as the minority party \u2013 but to no avail.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s like monkeys throwing darts,\u201d Jackson says of the current process. \u201cVirtually any system of redistricting would be far superior than what North Carolina has now.\u201d</p> \n<p>If passed, Jackson\u2019s proposal would have established an impartial nine-person commission tasked with drawing maps starting in 2030. But Daniel Rufty, chairman of North Carolina\u2019s Republican party in the 12th district, considers independent redistricting to be a \u201cna\u00efve\u201d idea. Whatever changes, whenever the changes happen, he says a new method of map drawing would still require appointees to oversee the process. Who will be appointing those individuals? Partisan officials.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe 12th district doesn\u2019t make sense,\u201d Rufty says. \u201cIt was drawn for partisan reasons that, like it or not, are constitutional. I don\u2019t exactly like it like that. But it is what it is.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/10/nc-party-redistrict/\" data-alt=\"All the shapes of the 12th district\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/10/nc-party-redistrict/\">All the shapes of the 12th district</a> \n <figcaption>\n  All the shapes of the 12th district\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>For now, the 12th district is no longer gerrymandered. A federal court tossed out the map in February as it pointed to evidence that \u201crace was the only nonnegotiable criterion\u201d used in drawing the district borders, and the legislature has since redrawn the district.</p> \n<p>But while the 12th is more compact, black people no longer account for the majority of registered voters like they once did.</p> \n<p>Several residents appealed to challenge the court ruling. Now the issue \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/09/north-carolina-congressional-primary-voting-districts-alma-adams\">which threw some congressional primaries into chaos this past June</a> \u2013 has landed on the US supreme court\u2019s fall docket. Lawyers challenging the lower court\u2019s decision argue the judges made their decision based on political affiliation rather than just race.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt remains undisputed that there is a very high correlation between African American voters and voters who regularly vote a straight Democratic ticket and support national Democratic candidates,\u201d the lawyer says.</p> \n<p>If the US supreme court overturns the rulings, it\u2019s likely that lawmakers would need to redraw the 12th\u2019s maps yet again. No matter the ruling, though, the effects of a quarter-century of gerrymandering in the 12th won\u2019t be undone overnight. Michael Dickerson, director of the Mecklenburg County board of elections, said that only 37,400 people of 520,000 registered voters cast ballots in the state\u2019s last election \u2013 the postponed June congressional primary.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e9c92738309e34feb2e9d1a2ffec74dc53d88ae9\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e9c92738309e34feb2e9d1a2ffec74dc53d88ae9/0_0_1000_600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Congresswoman Alma Adams canvasses a Charlotte neighborhood on the final day of early voting before the 12th district primary.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Congresswoman Alma Adams canvasses a Charlotte neighborhood on the final day of early voting before the 12th district primary.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Max Blau</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Congresswoman Alma Adams, who represents the 12th, won a heated primary with six other candidates.

She concedes winning that way, though beneficial to her, is a \u201cdisservice\u201d to the wider district.</p> \n<p>Without broader redistricting reform, she says, the lasting effects of gerrymandering could continue to dissuade constituents from casting ballots.</p> \n<p>\u201cPeople get discouraged,\u201d Adams said. \u201cThey don\u2019t bother to vote.\u201d</p>",

Too often, discussions about sexual assault center only on women \u2013 our victimization and perceived culpability. Since the tape\u2019s release, though, the national conversation has shifted: men are coming forward en masse to reject the idea that \u201creal men\u201d talk about abusing women \u2013 that this is normal language to use in a locker room or anywhere else. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.oregonlive.com/trending/2016/10/oregon_high_school_athletes_re.html\">A group of male high school athletes in Oregon</a> posed in feminist shirts with the picture\u2019s caption reading, \u201csexual assault is not locker room banter\u201d; <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/10/donald-trump-locker-room-banter-athletes-reaction\">pro athletes across the country</a> weighed in on social media, decrying the idea that this is just what men are like; a <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/locker-room-talk_us_5803819fe4b0e8c198a89710\">player for Amherst College\u2019s men\u2019s soccer team</a> criticized Trump\u2019s comments, writing: \u201cAs a sports team, we have found success by valuing the ideal of doing the right thing even when no one is watching.\u201d These men and others are quelling that nauseated feeling I\u2019ve had the last week or so. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/18/donald-trump-sexual-allegations-nine-women-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/583qb\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2817569\"            data-video-name=\"Nine women who accused Trump of sexual misconduct \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"Guardian, Access Hollywood, AP, CNN, Getty Images, NBC, Reuters, Palm Beach Post\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-58066cf1e4b0cd26ff71e6cc\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/10/19/161018womenst_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/10/19/161018womenst.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/10/19/161018womenst_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/18/donald-trump-sexual-allegations-nine-women-video\">Nine women who accused Trump of sexual misconduct</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Yes, it should go without saying that men don\u2019t support groping or vile comments about women and their bodies. But as long as we live in a culture where a former mayor of New York City can <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/09/politics/rudy-giuliani-donald-trump-state-of-the-union-debate/\">claim on national television</a> that all men talk about sexually assaulting women, we will need men to actively push back. </p> <p>Thankfully, the past decade of feminism has laid the groundwork for this very moment. The rise of \u201cyes means yes\u201d as a standard for consent, and the increased understanding of rape culture especially, have given men and women the ammunition they need to fight back against the insulting vision of masculinity that Trump\u2019s supporters would have us accept. That the Access Hollywood tapes were almost immediately and universally described by the media \u2013 which often gets things wrong on this front \u2013 as predatory and as describing sexual assault is also because of feminism\u2019s work.</p> <p>\u201cBoys will be boys\u201d doesn\u2019t fly \u2013 not anymore. </p> <p>I\u2019m heartbroken that this will be how the first woman president is elected \u2013 running against a ridiculously unworthy opponent, in the midst of a scandal that dehumanizes women. But the fact that it will be feminism, with the support of outraged men, that finally brings down Trump \u2013 well, I think that should take the edge off. </p>",

He says a flood of new psychoactive substances \u2013 previously known as legal highs \u2013 has partly fuelled the rise in bullying, violence and debt in jails.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/sep/21/prison-violence-at-wholly-unacceptable-level-ombudsman-finds\">In an inquiry report published last month into the record numbers of murders behind bars, Newcomen highlighted </a>\u201cthe lack of a structured and coordinated approach to challenging violent behaviour\u201d in some of the jails where the killings took place. </p> <p>He called for a much more rigorous approach to searching cells for weapons and managing violence and debt, not least that associated with what he described as an epidemic of new psychoactive substances. </p> <p>Prison governors say the increase in violence is a direct result of budget cuts that have led to 10,000 fewer prison officers dealing with a record 85,000 prisoners. </p> <p>The new justice secretary, Elizabeth Truss, does not deny \u2013 as her predecessor, Chris Grayling, did \u2013 the link between staffing levels and violence. Two weeks ago she announced an extra \u00a314m to employ 400 extra staff in the 10 \u201cmost challenged\u201d jails.

Plankton, the most abundant type of life found in the ocean, are microscopic marine plants that drift on or near the surface of the sea. They are sometimes referred to as \u201cthe grass of the sea\u201d because they are the basic food on which all other marine life depends. Plankton are able to convert inorganic compounds such as water, nitrogen and carbon into complex organic materials. With their ability to \u2018digest\u2019 these compounds, they are credited with removing as much carbon dioxide from the atmosphere as their counterparts on land. As a result, the oceans have a profound influence on climate. </p> <p>Some algae species are toxic or harmful. If they surge out of control during optimal blooming conditions they can exhaust the water of oxygen and suffocate larger fish. This phenomenon has dramatically increased in recent decades, and is particularly dangerous to fish farms because the fish cannot flee affected areas. Early warning of harmful blooms from satellites can help to prevent fish deaths.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"70736deeb9cb01bd7316e529cb3db51070c6e11a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/70736deeb9cb01bd7316e529cb3db51070c6e11a/0_0_2000_2600/769.jpg\" alt=\"Dust Libya\" width=\"769\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Plumes of dust pour across northern Libya and the Mediterranean Sea in early September.

Urban growth rates in recent years have been particularly pronounced in lower and middle-income countries. Africa depicts this global migration trend in high relief. Nairobi is a prime example, with its population pushing upward and its boundaries pushing outward.</p> <p>At the time of the last official government census in 2009, the population of Kenya numbered more than 38 million people, with 3.5 million housed in Nairobi \u2013 more than double the 1986 population. The images above, acquired in 1986 and 2016, show the expansion of Kenya\u2019s capital in the past three decades.</p> <p>While such migration often mirrors economic advancement, it also presents socioeconomic and environmental challenges. Rapid urban growth strains existing infrastructure. Conservationists also note that it discourages the preservation of natural habitat in favor of building more developments. In Nairobi, urbanisation has caused the city to encroach on former green spaces such as the nearby national parks and forests.</p> <p>Population density in Nairobi varies greatly, peaking in the city\u2019s slums, which house roughly 2.5 million people in about 200 settlements. Roughly 60% of Nairobi\u2019s population occupies just 6% of the land. The city\u2019s largest slum, Kibera (the light-coloured patch north of Nairobi national park) is made up of small, tightly packed structures.</p> <p>Although both of the images above were taken at a similar time of the year, the more recent one depicts greener vegetation, the result of a rainy El Ni\u00f1o cycle.</p>",
  "<p>The Global Warming Policy Foundation (GWPF) is an anti-climate policy advocacy group in the UK that often releases <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2014/mar/10/global-warming-optimism-unjustified-high-sensitivity\">misleading scientific \u201creports.\u201d</a> The group also hosts annual lectures, and this year, they booked a room at the Royal Society. Many members of the Royal Society expressed concern that the GWPF would exploit the organization\u2019s credibility, and <a href=\"http://www.desmog.uk/2016/10/05/exclusive-royal-society-under-internal-pressure-cancel-venue-booking-global-warming-policy-foundation\">asked that the event be cancelled</a>. <br></p> <p>The Royal Society\u2019s governing council met and <a href=\"http://www.desmog.uk/2016/10/12/world-s-oldest-scientific-academy-royal-society-allow-climate-denying-gwpf-lecture-go-ahead-despite-internal\">decided to allow the event to proceed</a>, for fear that cancellation would give it \u201can unwarranted higher profile.\u201d As a spokesperson for the Royal Society told DeSmog UK:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><em>The evidence shows us that the earth is warming and that recent warming is largely caused by human activities. Once that is accepted, there is scope for debate on the policy responses and that is the area that the GWPF claims to be interested in. </em></p> <p><em>If the GWPF uses this opportunity to misrepresent the scientific evidence it would undermine the legitimacy of its views on policy responses to climate change.</em></p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.thegwpf.com/matt-ridley-global-warming-versus-global-greening/\">The lecture</a> was delivered by writer <a href=\"http://www.skepticalscience.com/Matt_Ridley_blog.htm\">Matt Ridley</a>, and predictably, as is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2015/jan/21/matt-ridley-wants-to-gamble-earths-future-because-wont-learn-from-past\">the norm for Ridley</a>, the first three-quarters of his talk indeed misrepresented the scientific evidence. While Ridley doesn\u2019t deny the most basic aspects of human-caused global warming, he is a self-prescribed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2015/may/13/lukewarmers-the-third-stage-of-climate-denial\">\u201clukewarmer;\u201d a group that falls into the category of Stage 3 climate denial</a>.</p> <p>Ridley\u2019s lecture is a 5,600-word <a href=\"http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Gish_Gallop\">Gish Gallop</a> that would require a novel to fully debunk. However, he condensed his main arguments into four key points that are easily refuted:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><em>Why do I think the risk from global warming is being exaggerated? For four principal reasons.</em></p> <p><em>1. All environmental predictions of doom always are;<br> 2. the models have been consistently wrong for more than 30 years;<br> 3. the best evidence indicates that climate sensitivity is relatively low;<br> 4. the climate science establishment has a vested interest in alarm.</em></p> </blockquote> <h2><strong>We\u2019ve solved previous environmental problems, so let\u2019s not solve global warming?</strong></h2> <p>Ridley\u2019s first argument against the dangers of global warming is incredibly ironic. He claims that we have nothing to worry about because previous \u201cenvironmental predictions of gloom\u201d were wrong. But the reason his cited predictions of danger didn\u2019t come to fruition, in most cases, is because we took action to stop them.</p> <p>For example, Ridley lists acid rain and cancer-causing pesticides among his purported \u201cexaggerated\u201d environmental concerns. Many pesticides that were widely used in the 20<sup>th</sup> century are indeed carcinogenic, and their agricultural use was banned under the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockholm_Convention_on_Persistent_Organic_Pollutants\">Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants</a>. Acid rain caused by sulfur pollution was also a widespread problem until it was similarly addressed, for example through <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1985_Helsinki_Protocol_on_the_Reduction_of_Sulphur_Emissions\">the Helsinki Protocol</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid_rain#Emissions_trading\">a cap and trade system in the US</a> whose <a href=\"https://www.hks.harvard.edu/m-rcbg/heep/papers/SO2-Brief_digital_final.pdf\">economic benefits have outweighed its costs by a factor of roughly 100</a>.</p> <p>Proposed solutions to global warming involve <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2015/dec/14/the-paris-agreement-signals-that-deniers-have-lost-the-climate-wars\">international agreements</a> and cap and trade or other <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2014/jun/13/how-revenue-neutral-carbon-tax-creates-jobs-grows-economy\">pollution pricing systems</a> \u2013 the same mechanisms that successfully solved these previous environmental threats. Yet Ridley remarkably uses those threats as examples in his argument <em>against </em>taking similar steps to address the threats posed by climate change. It defies logic.</p> <h2><strong>Climate models have been remarkably accurate</strong></h2> <p>I\u2019ve written <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Climatology-Versus-Pseudoscience-Exposing-Predictions-ebook/dp/B00TIXVLZS/ref=mt_kindle?_encoding=UTF8&amp;me=\">a book focused on the accuracy of climate model predictions</a>, and in December I\u2019ll be <a href=\"https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm16/meetingapp.cgi/Session/15993\">presenting a talk on the subject at the annual American Geophysical Union conference</a>. In fact, the most recent research shows that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2016/jul/05/new-research-climate-may-be-more-sensitive-and-situation-more-dire\">climate models are even more accurate than previously thought</a>. So, were I not familiar with Ridley\u2019s long history of misrepresenting climate science, I would have been surprised that climate model accuracy is one of the main premises of his argument against climate concern.</p> <p>To make his case, Ridley relies on material from a few scientists like <a href=\"http://www.skepticalscience.com/John_Christy_blog.htm\">John Christy</a>, presented not in peer-reviewed journals, but instead for example <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2016/jan/18/ted-cruz-fact-check-which-temperature-data-are-the-best\">in Congressional hearings</a>. Recently, as John Abraham wrote, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2016/oct/14/climate-scientists-published-a-paper-debunking-ted-cruz\">climate scientists published a paper explaining the errors in those presentations</a>. Models have also accurately predicted other key climate changes, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2016/jul/27/climate-models-are-accurately-predicting-ocean-and-global-warming\">for example in ocean heat content</a>. There is simply no factual basis to Ridley\u2019s argument against climate model accuracy.</p> <h2><strong>Ridley\u2019s climate sensitivity cherry picking</strong></h2> <p>Joanna Haigh, Royal Society fellow and council member, <a href=\"http://www.desmog.uk/2016/10/18/scientists-reject-gwpf-climate-denial-lecture-delivered-royal-society-world-s-oldest-scientific-academy\">told DeSmog UK</a> of Ridley\u2019s of third key argument:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><em>Ridley claims not to dispute the science, he then disputes climate sensitivity estimates with selective citations.</em></p> </blockquote> <p>This is a nice way of saying that Ridley cherry picks the evidence he prefers and ignores the rest. <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2015/07/22/opinions/cook-techniques-climate-change-denial/\">Cherry picking is one of the five telltale techniques of science denial</a>. Being a self-described \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2015/may/13/lukewarmers-the-third-stage-of-climate-denial\">lukewarmer</a>\u201d like Ridley generally means believing that the climate is relatively insensitive to the increased greenhouse effect, and that climate change is therefore of little concern. In his talk, Ridley claimed:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><em>recent attempts to measure the sensitivity of the climate system to carbon dioxide using real data nearly all find that it is much lower than the models assume.</em></p> </blockquote> <p>This claim is nonsense. There have been a few papers suggesting a relatively low climate sensitivity, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2016/jan/12/nasa-study-fixes-error-in-low-contrarian-climate-sensitivity-estimates\">several subsequent studies have found those papers to be flawed</a>. There have also been other studies \u201cusing real data\u201d \u2013 for example, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2015/apr/30/overlooked-evidence-global-warming-may-proceed-faster-than-expected\">measurements of cloud and humidity changes</a> \u2013 suggesting that the Earth\u2019s climate sensitivity to the increased greenhouse effect is relatively high. It\u2019s also important to note that were Ridley right about low climate sensitivity, <a href=\"https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn23565-a-second-chance-to-save-the-climate/\">it would only buy us perhaps a decade or two</a> before the worst climate change consequences hit.</p> <p>In short, Ridley cherry picks the few papers that support his preferred position, neglects to mention that subsequent research has identified flaws in those studies, and ignores the vast body of research contradicting his beliefs.</p> <h2><strong>Conspiracy theories</strong></h2> <p>Ridley\u2019s fourth key argument, and a theme throughout his talk, exemplifies another telltale sign of science denial \u2013 conspiratorial thinking.

The easiest way to reject inconvenient data and expert conclusions is to declare that they\u2019re somehow biased.

Whether it be an election or an argument, if the other side cheated and conspired, then you didn\u2019t really lose.</p> <p>But there is no conspiracy. Ridley and GWPF want to risk humanity\u2019s future on their belief that climate change isn\u2019t dangerous. The problem is that their belief is premised on misleading, cherry picked, faulty, and conspiratorial arguments. As the Royal Society noted, by misrepresenting the scientific evidence, GWPF undermined the legitimacy of its policy views. </p> <p>We should be have a climate debate about the best policies to solve the problem. Groups that deny the problem by misrepresenting science only serve to distract from that much-needed debate, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2015/oct/05/the-republican-party-stands-alone-in-climate-denial\">outside of Donald Trump\u2019s Republican Party, they\u2019re no longer being listened to</a>.<br></p>",
  "<p>Amyann Darden believes Ronald Reagan was America\u2019s last great president. This election, she\u2019s voting for Hillary Clinton. </p> <p>Darden, 55, used to manage an accounting firm. But her life changed after a nervous breakdown. Now relying on social security, she was forced to leave her Seattle apartment when the rent went from $950 to $1,450 a month. She\u2019s been staying outdoors at Tent City 3, an encampment operated by homeless residents, while trying to save for a rental deposit.</p> <p>Over the last year, Portland, Seattle and the state of Hawaii have declared a state of emergency on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/09/homelessness-us-election-2016-san-francisco-voting\">homelessness</a>, with other cities considering it. But in the presidential election, the issue is receiving minimal political attention. At homeless camps Hazelnut Grove in Portland and Tent City 3 in Seattle, the issues that led people to become homeless reflect on the issues facing many voters this election: soaring rent, debt, access to healthcare, discrimination.</p> <p>We asked several camp residents for their thoughts.</p> <h2>Amyann Darden, 55: \u2018Retaining social security is an important issue to me\u2019</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"5013b8da3e28e2578afa9e8f42eb3f6b6c65e886\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5013b8da3e28e2578afa9e8f42eb3f6b6c65e886/0_109_1700_2441/696.jpg\" alt=\"Amyann Darden.\" width=\"696\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Amyann Darden in Seattle.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Annabel Clark</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I was going to vote Republican but when I watched the convention and saw what Trump stood for, I thought, \u201cNo way.\u201d His platform\u2019s based on hatred and fear.

Retaining social security is an important issue to me. I worked for 30 years and paid into it and then became disabled. I\u2019m very afraid it will be phased out during a Trump presidency.</p> <p>I was staying in motel rooms before I came to Tent City. I use my son\u2019s address for everything; he\u2019s in community living as he has schizophrenia. My ballot will be going there.</p> <p>I want to stay in Seattle to be close to my children and grandchildren. My daughter doesn\u2019t know I\u2019m at the camp. She has a lot of money and has helped me pay off some medical bills to raise my credit score and I don\u2019t want to ask for further help right now; eventually I will be disabled to a point where I will need care and I\u2019ll need to ask then.</p> <h2>Zoe White, 34: \u2018I\u2019ll probably vote for Jill Stein\u2019</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"61257b76bf899c5017e952cf071d57203637fa11\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/61257b76bf899c5017e952cf071d57203637fa11/0_193_1700_2357/721.jpg\" alt=\"Zoe White.\" width=\"721\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Zoe White in Portland.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Annabel Clark</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I\u2019ve voted every year I\u2019ve been eligible. Generally Green or Socialist, sometimes Democrat. I\u2019ll probably vote for Jill Stein this year. There\u2019s no representation of ecologists, left causes or democratic socialism anywhere else.</p> <p>I see Hillary Clinton as having a liberal wrapper around a traditionalist core. I don\u2019t know whose interests she\u2019s going to sell out to, but I\u2019m pretty sure she\u2019s going to sell out. I voted for Bernie Sanders in the primary election. Now he\u2019s telling people to vote for Hillary; I\u2019m disappointed in him.</p> <p>There are many misconceptions of houseless people. First of all, that we don\u2019t work \u2013 we do. I had a job for a long time at a country club. I would say through that I\u2019ve been subject to employment discrimination as a female who\u2019s trans.</p> <p>There are also the insinuations that we\u2019re lazy, use drugs, we\u2019re all thieves. In Hazelnut Grove, where I\u2019m lucky enough to live, we\u2019re an intentional community. If you steal from someone, you\u2019re run the hell out. Here there\u2019s the idea that if you put into the community, the community reciprocates. I feel like that type of culture is being squeezed out during the gentrification process [of Portland]. Property values are taking precedence over community.</p> <h2>Andrew Constantino, 41: \u2018I have to watch the train wreck\u2019</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"dd407800bd70c16ff416b30f0a770bc6c99ba5b6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dd407800bd70c16ff416b30f0a770bc6c99ba5b6/0_200_1700_2350/723.jpg\" alt=\"Andrew Constantino\" width=\"723\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Andrew Constantino in Seattle.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Annabel Clark</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I\u2019m voting for Hillary. On her own merits, she\u2019s committed to social issues and doing good. I would never even consider voting for Trump. But I have to watch the train wreck; I cannot stop myself.</p> <p>Some people think anyone getting government assistance automatically votes liberal, but that\u2019s absolutely not true. You hear all these Trump lovers here. I try telling them, \u201cDo you realize he\u2019s the type of person who doesn\u2019t care about anything that\u2019s ever happened to you?\u201d But it\u2019s like being with your family at Thanksgiving; you try avoiding those conversations because they go nowhere.</p> <p>I\u2019ve lived in Seattle for almost 20 years. It\u2019s become more and more expensive to survive. When my girlfriend and I lost our jobs very close together, we burned through our savings.</p> <p>We\u2019re both working full time again, but it\u2019s just that there are no good options. I refuse to pay some exorbitant amount of rent to live in absolute poverty. I\u2019d rather do this until there\u2019s a reasonable option.</p> <h2>Roxy Garske, 58: \u2018I don\u2019t trust Hillary after the emails\u2019</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"6610f8b8663f4cf3b680fd188a81a22a1e03b1b9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6610f8b8663f4cf3b680fd188a81a22a1e03b1b9/0_211_1700_2339/727.jpg\" alt=\"Roxy Garske\" width=\"727\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Roxy Garske in Seattle.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Annabel Clark</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I\u2019m voting for Gary Johnson because he\u2019s not one of the other two. I don\u2019t like Hillary because I don\u2019t believe what she says; I don\u2019t trust her after the emails. I think she\u2019s too rightwing. She\u2019s more interested in the needs of the rich and powerful.</p> <p>If I could only vote between her and Trump, I\u2019d choose her. The thought of him winning scares me, especially for women. I\u2019ve got two daughters and two granddaughters. If he\u2019s voted in, he\u2019ll turn back the clock. He\u2019s already stirring up trouble by getting people worried about immigrants.</p> <p>None of the candidates are addressing homelessness. It\u2019s an invisible society. Lots of people here don\u2019t know they can vote. But when we had a voter drive, around 30 people registered and were excited to find they could vote.</p> <p>I have peripheral neuropathy and spinal stenosis. This is the second time I\u2019ve been homeless. About five years ago, my husband said, \u201cI\u2019m going to get stuck taking care of you.\u201d He said he wanted a divorce, which is fine. I was homeless while I waited for the settlement but then I got a house. I had to go into hospital and while I was very unwell; I lost my house. It went into foreclosure in July. I stayed with friends but they\u2019ve got some other people staying there now, but I\u2019m going back when they\u2019re gone. I\u2019m just here for a month.</p> <h2>Marvin Ross, 56: \u2018A woman will be better off running the country\u2019</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"1c7a1aed49103eaede4c759cf6f81e9f857e1214\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1c7a1aed49103eaede4c759cf6f81e9f857e1214/0_270_1700_2280/746.jpg\" alt=\"Marvin Ross\" width=\"746\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Marvin Ross in Portland.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Annabel Clark</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Donald Trump is not important to me.

Why would he want to step down?</p> <p>I think a woman will be better off running the country than a man anyway. Look at how long men have run this country and how they\u2019ve messed it up. I haven\u2019t always voted but when I have, it\u2019s been Democrat.</p> <p>Right now, I\u2019m living in a big tent. I\u2019ve got a real bed. My clothes on hangers. All my CDs. I\u2019m here for the long term. I\u2019m building my own tiny house; I\u2019m just waiting for more wood. I\u2019ve never built a house before; I\u2019m learning from watching others. I\u2019ve got a criminal background for drug possession that keeps me from renting. But I\u2019ve never tried to rent. I\u2019ve lived with girlfriends and family members.

I can\u2019t really do news. What\u2019s happening in front of me right now, today, is what matters. But it\u2019s still important to me to cast my vote because if I don\u2019t vote, I\u2019ve got no right to bitch.</p> <p>I want to vote for Bernie Sanders, so I\u2019m going to write his name in. If I had to choose between Trump and Clinton, I\u2019d choose Trump because I\u2019m not sure about a woman having that much control yet. I respect Trump because he\u2019s built everything from nothing. But I don\u2019t think he\u2019s the right guy for the job. It\u2019s all kind of confusing in my head.</p> <p>I moved my husband and myself here in July. He has Parkinson\u2019s and this is where he gets treated. We came from Alaska where we could get housing but we were in drugs real bad. We were doing marijuana and meth. We can\u2019t afford rent here but if we return, I know he\u2019ll go right back to it. He\u2019s angry at me for keeping us homeless. But we\u2019re doing good. We\u2019ve been sober since July. I still drink once in a while.

I mean if somebody else was president, would I still be sitting here? Probably. But I hear it\u2019s better to vote for the wrong person than not at all. And I\u2019m registered.</p> <p>Last night was my first night on the streets. I slept behind a building. This will be my first night at Tent City 3 \u2013 they\u2019ve just given me a tent.

I left while he was at work and went to a hotel for two days.</p> <p>I used meth yesterday so I\u2019m pretty emotional. I\u2019m about to go into treatment. I\u2019ve waited two months for that and hopefully it will get me on my feet.</p> <p>My ballot will go to my mom\u2019s house.

But there\u2019s not enough housing for the population. And the housing policies are causing a lot of houselessness. Like no-cause evictions [in which a landlord can terminate a contract for no reason with 30 days\u2019 notice] and the applications fee you have to pay every time you apply to rent somewhere.

  "<p>Most horror movies start cheerily. There will be often be scenes in which the lead characters demonstrate the optimism, innocence and playfulness of youth \u2013 and a thoroughly misplaced sense of security. On 29 March 1994, the England team boarded their coach to the Queen\u2019s Park Oval in Trinidad knowing that, all things being equal, they would return that evening drunk on victory and Tetley. Alec Stewart was asked by a Sky reporter how the team would get on. \u201cDon\u2019t worry\u201d, he said, sticking his thumbs up. \u201cWe\u2019ll be fine today.\u201d Ten hours later, after his off stump was detonated by the final ball of the day, Graham Thorpe\u2019s blank face told the story of an horrific trauma. England had been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2009/feb/04/andy-bull-rob-smyth-on-england-and-the-west-indies-for-the-joy-of-six\">sliced and diced by Sir Curtly Ambrose</a>, reduced to 40 for eight in a manner that would have shattered even Kipling\u2019s equilibrium. This wasn\u2019t a case of snatching defeat from the jaws of victory; they\u2019d had glory snatched from them in exchange for humiliation. They never ever saw it coming at all. For a young team starting out under a new captain, it was a terrifying insight into just how tough it can be to win a Test match \u2013 especially when you are up against perhaps the greatest match winner of all.</p> <p>England were given little chance when they travelled to the Caribbean in January 1994. West Indies had not lost a Test series since 1979-80, even if their victories were becoming less comfortable, and had lost only three home Tests in 16 years. England lost more than that in 1993 alone: they were walloped 4-1 at home by Australia, a miserable follow-up to a shambolic tour of India and Sri Lanka in which they lost all four Tests.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/may/22/curtley-ambrose-small-talk\">Curtly Ambrose: \u2018You\u2019re asking me questions I\u2019ve never been asked before\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A stirring dead-rubber win over Australia at The Oval, in their second Test under the captaincy of Atherton, provided an important injection of hope. Atherton, 25, wanted to follow the template of that Australia side by investing in young players of character and class and sticking with them through thick and thin. For the first time in 17 years, an England touring party included none of Graham Gooch, Sir Ian Botham, David Gower or Mike Gatting. The oldest player was Devon Malcolm, who turned 31 during the first Test. England lost the first two Tests emphatically, by eight wickets and then an innings. But they knew they would have to go through many hard times first, just like Australia in the mid-to-late 1980s, and there was plenty of hope in the batting of Alec Stewart, Graeme Hick and particularly Atherton, who bravely stood up to a fearsome, calculated barrage from Courtney Walsh in the first Test.</p> <p>In the third match at Trinidad, they played excellently. Chris Lewis, Ian Salisbury and Angus Fraser reduced West Indies from 158 for one to 252 all out on the first day, before Graham Thorpe\u2019s 86 and some useful tail-end batting \u2013 the last two wickets added 47 \u2013 helped England to 328.</p> <p>When Jimmy Adams fell to Salisbury off the last ball of the third day, West Indies were 143 for five, a lead of 67. With only Shivnarine Chanderpaul remaining among the recognised batsmen. England were 4-11 with the bookies, having started the match at 12-1. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to go into the rest day as favourites,\u201d said their manager, Keith Fletcher. \u201cI might get some sleep.\u201d</p> <p>The first sign the match might not have a happy ending for England came when Chanderpaul, on four, was put down by Hick at slip on the fourth morning. He was reprieved again by Hick on 29, another relatively straightforward chance for such a brilliant slipper.</p> <p>Chanderpaul, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/apr/28/the-spin-shivnarine-chanderpaul-west-indies\">playing only his second Test at the age of 19</a>, frustrated England with a three-hour 50 and added 60 for the seventh wicket with Winston Benjamin.

During a rain break, Fraser decided to nick his Middlesex team-mate Mark Ramprakash\u2019s seat by telling him there was somebody outside the dressing-room waiting to see him \u2013 \u201ca silly prank of the kind you often do to pass the time in these situations\u201d, as Fraser put it. Ramprakash returned unamused and threw Fraser\u2019s England cap in some water. Fraser booted a bin across the dressing-room and the two squared up to each other.</p> <p>England eventually dismissed West Indies for 269, with Andy Caddick taking a Test-best six for 65. That included the wicket of Ambrose, bowled for 12 as he failed to connect with an enormous yahoo. Ambrose had been told to play for his partner Chanderpaul but was so affronted by Caddick copying the great Sir Richard Hadlee\u2019s action that he wanted to \u201cbeat his bowling\u201d. He received and accepted a rare reprimand from his team-mates for the manner of his dismissal.</p> <p>Caddick, without trying or realising, had awoken the beast. Pride was one of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/may/22/curtley-ambrose-small-talk\">Ambrose\u2019s greatest weapons</a>; pride in himself and also the West Indies. He never liked cricket as a teenager \u2013 he wanted to play basketball in the NBA \u2013 but once it became a career, the highest standards were non-negotiable for someone of his nature. He had let the team down, and they faced the prospect of a rare defeat at home. There had also been some criticism earlier in the series after a subdued performance in Jamaica; some even suggested that, at 30, Ambrose was past it and considering retirement.</p> <p>All of this fuelled his ire. \u201cI was at my best when something was on the line,\u201d said Ambrose in his autobiography, Time to Talk, \u201cwhether it was a match, a series or even my reputation.\u201d If it was more than one, as at Trinidad, woe betide those in his way. In the last hour and a half, he struck down upon England with great vengeance and furious anger.</p> <p>England\u2019s target was a tricky 194, when it should have been nearer 100 or 110. The extra runs also took more time out of the day; this, along with the rain break, meant only 15 overs remained on the fourth day when they started batting. Had it not rained there would have been around 40 overs left and Ambrose would have needed to keep something in the tank for a second spell. Instead he was able to throw everything at the batsmen.</p> <p>England\u2019s top six \u2013 Atherton, Stewart, Ramprakash, Robin Smith, Hick and Thorpe \u2013 looks a bit stronger on paper now than it did then. It\u2019s easy to forget careers are always in flux and even great batsmen have periods of famine. All four of England\u2019s middle order had been dropped or omitted at some stage during the previous summer\u2019s Ashes and were trying to establish \u2013 or in Smith\u2019s case re-establish \u2013 themselves at Test level.</p> <p>Atherton had also been left out during the tour of India a year earlier, but now he was England\u2019s captain and most important batsman. He sensed that, if England were one down at the close, they would be in with a great chance of victory. Instead, they were two down by the end of the first over.</p> <p>\u201cQuality bowlers essentially need two of three things: pace, movement and accuracy,\u201d wrote Atherton in Wisden Cricketers\u2019 Almanack 2001. \u201cAmbrose had all three.\u201d Even from the first ball of the innings. Ambrose didn\u2019t really believe in the concept of the loosener, and his opening delivery to Atherton was a jaffa. It was full, kept a bit low and seamed back to hit him on the pad in line with off and middle. It seemed to take everyone by surprise \u2013 even Ambrose, who had almost completed his follow-through when he suddenly threw his hands up and down in one movement and snapped round to point demandingly at the umpire Steve Bucknor.</p> <p>As he was doing so, Atherton\u2019s momentum took him outside the line of off stump. He had both arms outstretched, like a suspect surrendering to police, and held the pose as he awaited the decision. He is not sure why he did so but it made for a glorious image as both men stared at Bucknor. He was a leisurely umpire at the best of times and, although the wait only lasted two or three seconds, it seemed to go on forever \u2013 a moment of tension in which, perhaps, both players instinctively realised the game would probably be decided. Bucknor raised the finger and Ambrose \u2013 whose primal celebrations in this spell were almost as memorable as the wickets \u2013 started punching an imaginary speedbag with both hands.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b9184e24c1e7ef1f8588083b84759941df8b52d7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b9184e24c1e7ef1f8588083b84759941df8b52d7/0_0_2411_3623/665.jpg\" alt=\"Curtly Ambrose celebrates as England captain Michael Atherton is left stranded by his opening ball, Atherton was out LBW and the target of 194 looked an awfully long way off.\" width=\"665\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Curtly Ambrose celebrates as England captain Michael Atherton is left stranded by his opening ball, Atherton was out LBW and the target of 194 looked an awfully long way off.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ben Radford/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For a few years, before he was dragged down by his injured back and his team\u2019s lack of spine, Atherton was England\u2019s rock. They developed an alarming tendency to collapse when he was dismissed. That was problematic at the best of times, never mind when he got a golden duck.</p> <p>The new batsman was Ramprakash, who had started his Test career splendidly against West Indies in 1991, with a series of patient 20-something innings that were far better than the bald statistics suggested. Yet in the two-and-a-half years since then he had been dropped three times; now he found himself batting at three in the England team for the first time, on the toughest tour of all. In what would become a theme of his career, runs in the final Test of an Ashes summer had got him on the winter tour. When he turned the last ball of Ambrose\u2019s first over towards long-leg, the England fans cheered loudly: one run down, 193 to go.</p> <p>Ramprakash turned for a second but was then paralysed by indecision and started skidding back and forth. By the time Walsh\u2019s throw came to the wicket-keeper Junior Murray, Stewart had run past him at the non-striker\u2019s end. It was a shambolic run-out that would be used in evidence against Ramprakash, apparent proof of a man who found Test cricket too much to handle mentally. Yet Ramprakash says there was a far simpler explanation for the confusion: he lost sight of Walsh and had no idea whether the ball was in his hand or not, and therefore whether a second run was viable.</p> <p>It looked like a moment of blind panic, however, and as such had a huge impact on the morale of both sides. Angus Fraser recalls Atherton burying his head in a towel shouting \u201cNo, no, no\u201d as Ramprakash was run out. After that Atherton retreated to the shower, with the crowd generously providing a wicket-update service for him.</p> <p>The arrival of Robin Smith at No4 would ordinarily have been comforting for England. He was a magnificent player of quick bowling, surely the bravest player of his generation. But he was in the middle of the worst period of his Test career and was struggling to forge a working relationship with the coach Keith Fletcher; Smith later described Fletcher and Ray Illingworth as \u2018the most appalling man managers, the most appalling coaches and the most appalling people that I\u2019ve met\u2019.</p> <p>This was by far the worst of his four full series against West Indies, despite a Test-best 175 in the final game. In Trinidad he survived his first ball and willed himself to get forward to his second. \u201cI played a beautiful forward-defensive\u201d, he says. \u201cThe only problem was that I was about two minutes too late!\u201d Just as Smith was completing the stroke, he heard the distinctive clink of disturbed furniture. The ball from Ambrose was so fast that it had already gone through the gate to remove his middle stump. Ambrose punched the air wildly \u2013 \u201cas if whipping a lasso\u201d, to use Will Luke\u2019s great description in The Cricketer \u2013 and England were five for three in the third over.</p> <p>A recurring feature of Ambrose\u2019s great spells was his<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2011/sep/13/curtly-ambrose-hall-of-fame\"> ability to read both the pitch and the match situation</a>. He was a far more intelligent bowler than some recognised. With Trinidad getting lower and offering a little sideways movement, he bowled fast, full and straight. Both Atherton and Smith fell to off cutters that were pitched up, and in the whole mini-session he bowled only five short balls in 7.5 overs. \u2018It was entirely different in its intent from Walsh\u2019s spell in Jamaica\u2019, wrote Atherton in his autobiography, Opening Up. \u201cWalsh\u2019s main aim was to intimidate while Ambrose, sensing a match to win and a wearing pitch to exploit, was only interested in wickets. Of course there was the occasional bouncer \u2026 but Ambrose\u2019s general length was full and the effect was dramatic.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2011/sep/13/curtly-ambrose-hall-of-fame\">How Curtly Ambrose, West Indies' silent assassin, became a big noise | Rob Bagchi</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It made for a different type of intimidation. There was less threat to a batsman\u2019s safety but far more to his sanity, such was the extent to which Ambrose overwhelmed England. They knew there would be knocks on their journey, they knew Test cricket was bloody hard. But this, this was unimaginable. They had innocently taken a wrong turn and ended up on the meanest streets of Test cricket.</p> <p>The cacophony of joy at the Queen\u2019s Park Oval was such that England suffered a sensory overload. \u201cThere was all the excitement, the sea of faces and the noise,\u201d said Fraser. \u201cThe banging as Ambrose ran up to bowl. The sound just got louder and louder as each of our wickets fell \u2026 The conditions were good for Ambrose but he just worked everything into a fever pitch. We were trapped in a very intimidating environment with nowhere to go.\u201d</p> <p>The only person not making any noise was Ambrose. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2015/mar/20/cricket-west-indies-curtly-ambrose-richard-hadlee-sledging-mike-selvey\">\u201cHe didn\u2019t say anything\u201d</a>, says Hick. \u201cNot many of the great bowlers do.\u201d Ambrose had a silent charisma that was irresistible to West Indies fans, England batsmen \u2013 even England fans. Geoffrey Boycott, commentating for Sky, said it was \u201cpossibly the most exciting period of Test cricket I can remember in all my years of playing and watching\u201d. In Antigua, Ambrose\u2019s mother Hillie ran into the street to ring a handbell every time he took a wicket; in Trinidad, the unofficial cheerleader, nicknamed Blue Food, a former policeman who had been going to the ground since 1948, blew his conch-smell triumphantly. Banners such as BOYCOTT PAD UP NOW! and TOO MUCH TETLEY OLD CHAP! rubbed it in.</p> <p>It was a struggle to think straight, never mind play straight. The noise and the sheer speed with which things spiralled out of control meant there was no time to take stock. There was barely time to do anything. Nasser Hussain, the 12th man, sensed the dressing-room tension before the start of the innings and decided to walk around the ground to get a chicken roti. By the time he got there, England were four down. Fraser and Lewis had a similar idea and followed Hussain at the fall of the second wicket. They only made it as far as the KFC, by which time England were five down and Lewis had to run back to pad up.</p> <p>The dressing-room was a hive of chaos. \u201cI batted at six\u201d, says Thorpe. \u201cNormally batting there I wouldn\u2019t have put any kit on at all, but here I was padded up within three overs. The dressing-room was basically a load of blokes walking around getting their kit on.\u201d</p> <p>Or off. Wickets fell at such regular intervals that, although he lasted only 17 minutes, Hick\u2019s innings was England\u2019s fourth longest stay. \u201cIt\u2019s all happening so fast that you don\u2019t really gather yourself and maybe get in the right mental state\u201d, says Hick:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There\u2019s not much to say about my innings: I played a little half-hearted shot outside off stump and nicked off. I\u2019d had a reasonable start to the tour having got 96 in Jamaica, and I was disappointed not to kick on from there for the rest of the trip. It was just a quality spell of bowling. There were a few average shots but that\u2019s the pressure he builds. I would put Ambrose and Glenn McGrath in the same bracket. They gave you very little to feed off. Ambrose and Walsh had days when they would alternate \u2013 one would be a bit slower, and the next day the other one would do the hard yards. Ambrose was quick. He had enough pace. He wasn\u2019t maybe as quick as Waqar Younis or Allan Donald but he wasn\u2019t far below.</p> </blockquote> <p>On that particular day he was even quicker than usual. There was no speedgun back then but the pace \u2013 and force \u2013 of Ambrose was such that all three batsmen who were bowled had a stump knocked out of the ground. The second of those was Stewart, who lost his off stump to leave England 26 for five. His 18 was comfortably the highest score of the innings. The rest of the top six made double figures \u2013 but only between them, with a total of 10 runs. Ambrose gave high-class batsmen an insight into what it\u2019s like to be a tailender: intimidated, overwhelmed and with a legitimate fear that every ball might be the last.</p> <p>The panic in the England dressing-room was such that, with the score 26 for five, they sent in Ian Salisbury at No7 as a nightwatchman for Jack Russell. Salisbury\u2019s excellent first-innings 36 was one of the reasons England got into a winning position. Here he lasted three balls before edging Walsh to slip. When Russell fended a rare Ambrose short ball to second slip, England were 37 for seven.</p> <p>Thorpe was the last of the remaining batsmen. \u201cI was out there for a little bit of time\u201d, he says, \u201cbut I just did a lot of fending off.\u201d He lasted 28 balls, the longest stay of the innings, yet only managed three runs. Thorpe was just starting to change his approach, a move that was inspired by watching Brian Lara, and would became one of the great initiative-seizers of the 1990s. \u201cI just tried to stay in the game. A few years later I would have tried to counterattack but my tactics weren\u2019t very advanced at that stage.\u201d</p> <p>From the penultimate ball of the final over, he was torpedoed by a delivery from Ambrose that kept low and removed his off stump. Without even turning round to look at the stumps, an expressionless Thorpe shuffled off. His gazillion-yard stare is the defining image of England\u2019s humiliation. \u201cI\u2019ve seen it a few times on TV\u201d, he laughs. \u201cI think there was a bit of shock. I was probably just thinking, \u2018Crikey, Test cricket is a pretty brutal game.</p> <p>\u2018You play well for three days and you\u2019re in the game all the time and then \u2013 bang! \u2013 game over\u2019.\u201d At that stage Thorpe was still waiting for his first Test victory. Ambrose and Walsh had more Test wins than the whole England team combined.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5f1b2cd8e188106c50ce4e0141ea9a516836cb8d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5f1b2cd8e188106c50ce4e0141ea9a516836cb8d/0_0_4096_2731/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Robin Smith is out for a duck, beaten by Curtly Ambrose\u2019s pace. \u2018I played a beautiful forward-defensive\u2019, he said. \u2018The only problem was that I was about two minutes too late.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Robin Smith is out for a duck, beaten by Curtly Ambrose\u2019s pace. \u2018I played a beautiful forward-defensive\u2019, he said. \u2018The only problem was that I was about two minutes too late.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rebecca Naden/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Thorpe, like Stewart and a few of the others, could theoretically have got forward to Ambrose, even on an uneven pitch. But in theory there\u2019s no reason why you can\u2019t shoot the devil in the back. It was matter over mind. \u201cI know Boycs said we should try to get forward\u201d, says Thorpe, \u201cbut it\u2019s never that easy. He didn\u2019t give too many drive balls anyway. I think I drove him twice in my whole career, once in Barbados and once at The Oval.\u201d</p> <p>The match was wrapped up the following morning. Walsh took the last two wickets and England limped past their lowest-ever total, 45 all out against Australia in 1887, by one run. Ambrose ended with figures of 10-1-24-6. He had done his work the previous night. \u201cIt is unlikely,\u201d wrote Matthew Engel in The Guardian, \u201cthat anyone in history has been quite such a certainty to produce a performance of such magnitude when it actually matters.\u201d</p> <p>In 44 Test victories Ambrose took 229 wickets at 16.86 and was Man of the Match 14 times. Among those who have played in at least five Test wins, only Muttiah Muralitharan has a better percentage of Man of the Match awards. The timing and the manner of Ambrose\u2019s work makes him arguably the greatest matchwinner of all.</p> <p>\u201cPeople ask me to explain how I can inflict these devastating, match-winning spells and I believe the simple answer is about having the strength of character to overcome adversity as all my best spells came in situations when the team was against it,\u201d he said in Time to Talk. \u201cIt is about having sheer determination that we are not going to lose. I thrive on challenges, negative comments or anything where people doubt my ability. More often than not when I have been faced with these challenges I have come out triumphant.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2014/nov/04/joy-of-six-great-fast-bowling-spells\">The Joy of Six:  great fast-bowling spells | Russell Jackson</a> </p> </aside>  <p>With many bowlers, control and aggression are almost mutually exclusive, but Ambrose was able to summon one without compromising the other. He was a raging metronome. Despite his obvious greatness, England were slaughtered in the press. Such shockingly low totals were unusual in those days. They have become a much more regular occurrence since the turn of the century, and we realise that it can happen to anyone \u2013 even Australia. It feels a little harsh that the 46 all out is still used as shorthand for England\u2019s struggles in the 1990s as there were far worse performances with bat and ball. They failed, palpably, but only in the most exacting circumstances. \u201cWhen a great bowler is in the zone, I don\u2019t care how good a player you are, the bowler will win,\u201d said Stewart. \u201cAmbrose was awesome.\u201d</p> <p>A 5-0 defeat seemed inevitable after that, but no side bounced back from rock bottom as effectively as England in the 1990s. They won astonishingly in the next Test at Barbados, West Indies\u2019 first defeat there for 59 years, and a 3-1 series score was probably a slight overachievement. But the young team did not stick together: Illingworth took over as chairman of selectors later that month and started picking players in their forties, never mind their thirties. Atherton\u2019s far-sighted vision did not become reality until Duncan Fletcher became coach in 1999.</p> <p>Many of the players had fine careers nonetheless and of the team beaten in Trinidad, Atherton, Stewart, Ramprakash, Thorpe, Hick and Caddick took part in 2000 when England finally won a series against West Indies for the first time since 1968. They did so despite exceptional bowling from Ambrose and Walsh, who had a combined age of 73 and essentially spent the summer bowling 78mph off-spin. They had a doosra too.</p> <p>Ambrose had already announced he would retire after the series and received a guard of honour from the England players in the final Test at The Oval. There is also a lovely picture of him walking off the field for the final time with Walsh. \u201cIt was one of the most touching moments I have seen on a field, when The Oval crowd rose to Ambrose and his great mate, Courtney Walsh, to applaud them off the field for an assumed last time,\u201d wrote Atherton in Wisden. \u201cThey left, arm-in-arm, one sensed close to tears, and halfway up the pavilion steps Ambrose symbolically removed his famous white armbands, safe in the knowledge that his legs would have to do no more pounding.\u201d</p> <p>This was not Stockholm Syndrome; everybody loved Curtly and Courtney, even the England batsmen who they had terrorised for so long. For this generation of outstanding players who did not win the Ashes, regaining the Wisden Trophy was the crowning glory. They had survived the most brutal rite of passage to get there.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"165a41d8867be7dd4a1eaefa4add9ae7e010ce9b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/165a41d8867be7dd4a1eaefa4add9ae7e010ce9b/0_0_1869_2798/668.jpg\" alt=\"Supreme Bowling is out now\" width=\"668\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Supreme Bowling is out now</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><em>\u2022 Supreme Bowling: 100 Great Test Performances </em><a href=\"http://vonkrummpublishing.co.uk/\"><em>is published by Von Krumm</em></a><em> and is out now </em><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Supreme-Bowling-Great-Test-Performances/dp/0956732151\"><em>and available here</em></a><em>.

  "<p>A Conservative MP and sections of the British media have been accused of vilifying refugees by calling for dental tests to verify the ages of child migrants.</p> <p>Images of some of those brought to the UK <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/oct/17/refugee-children-britain-calais-resettlement-uk\">under a scheme to resettle unaccompanied children</a> from the Calais refugee camp suggest they are over 18.

He added: \u201cWe need to be quite hard-nosed here. People are desperate, they will say what they need to say to get in.\u201d</p> <p>Allen said medical tests would be \u201cvery intrusive and could be retraumatising\u201d. She added: \u201cIf there are issues about the age of the people who have come in in this first cohort, then that can be looked at. But the key issue is, how do we bring the hundreds of children who are in the camp who have a right to be here under various conventions and obligations and how do we ensure that there is now a process to get all of those brought in to the UK.

His estate has been estimated at between $100m and $300m.</p> <p>According to court documents made public on Tuesday, attorneys for Prince\u2019s siblings and half-siblings argued that Brianna Nelson and Victoria Nelson should not be named as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jul/30/prince-judge-rules-out-30-potential-heirs-to-singers-estate\">heirs to his estate</a>, as they are not legally Prince\u2019s heirs. A hearing on the issue is set for Friday.</p> <p>Brianna Nelson and her niece Victoria have filed court documents claiming they are descendants of the late Duane Nelson Sr, who they say was Prince\u2019s half-brother. While the pair do not claim a genetic link to the singer, they say Prince\u2019s biological father considered Duane as his own son, and that Prince treated him like a brother.

  "<p></p> <p>Dr Mar\u00eda Gonzales cannot recall the exact moment when she realised Venezuela\u2019s health crisis had enveloped her hospital, the Luis Razetti in the Caribbean coastal city of Barcelona.</p> <p>It may have been during a surge in cases of scabies, a skin infection that ought to be easily prevented with soap, water and disinfectant. It could have been her first sight of an emaciated child, something she had only previously seen in medical books or documentaries about famines in Africa. Or perhaps it was when she found herself prescribing a 40-minute cold shower because the pharmacy had run out of anti-fever drugs.<br></p> <p>But the severity of the situation was certainly clear earlier this month, when a patient came in with a suspected case of diphtheria \u2013 a disease that Venezuela was supposed to have eradicated more than 20 years ago.<br></p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s like we have returned to the last century,\u201d she says. \u201cEverything is going backwards.\u201d<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/11/venezuela-on-the-brink-a-journey-through-a-country-in-crisis\">Venezuela on the brink: a journey through a country in crisis</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The refrain is increasingly common among medical professionals in Venezuela, where acute shortages of food, drugs and sanitary products threaten to reverse decades of health gains.<br></p> <p>Despite its immense oil wealth, the country is in the midst of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/11/venezuela-on-the-brink-a-journey-through-a-country-in-crisis\">devastating economic, social and health crises</a>. It has the world\u2019s steepest economic decline, the second highest murder rate and the sharpest-rising inflation (forecast to reach 2,200% by the end of next year, according to the International Monetary Fund).</p> <p>These problems all converge in the nation\u2019s hospitals, where doctors report rising levels of mortality thanks to a dire shortage of medical supplies, shutdowns of operating theatres, staff declines and violent crime, including gunshots during surgery and mugging in corridors.<br></p> <p>For years, among the proudest boasts of the Bolivarian Socialist administration was that it eradicated hunger, reduced poverty and improved healthcare for the poor.</p> <p>But the trend now appears to be moving in the opposite direction at an alarming speed. Reliable data is hard to find. The government has acknowledged that maternal mortality \u2013 a key healthcare indicator \u2013 has doubled in the past year. The opposition says the deterioration is five-fold \u2013 and that death of newborns increased 100-fold.<br></p> <p>The Venezuelan Health Observatory, a research centre at the Central University of Venezuela in Caracas, estimates that <a href=\"http://www.ovsalud.org/publicaciones/salud/encuesta-nacional-de-hospitales-2016/\">fewer than 10% of operating theatres, emergency rooms and intensive care units are fully operational</a>.

Earlier this year, the president of the Venezuelan Association of Clinics and Hospitals in the state of Carabobo, was <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2015/04/29/venezuelas-health-care-crisis\">detained by police and questioned for three hours</a> after he went on TV to complain about medical shortages. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Some patients have been waiting for six months to have bones reset because there are no rods, pins and plates</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Two doctors smuggled the Guardian past security guards for a tour of their hospital, where the scale of deterioration was evident.<br></p> <p>In the basement, the radiography room was permanently closed; patients were sleeping on dirty beds in the corridors. On the ground floor, doctors were staging a protest over shortages of drugs and medical equipment. In the second-floor trauma ward, some patients have been waiting for six months to have bones reset because there are no rods, pins and plates. In the paediatric ward, impoverished mothers of malnourished children were soliciting donations of food and medicine that the hospital could not provide. </p> <p>The eighth-floor psychiatric ward was perhaps the most disturbing. \u201cWe have zero psych drugs so instead we use sedatives. The patients have been sedated for the past three months,\u201d said Pablo \u00c1lvarez, another doctor at the hospital. \u201cThis is extremely bad because their pathologies are worsening the entire time and we are just masking the symptoms. The damage is irreversible.\u201d<br></p> <p>Luis Razetti is supposed to be the anchor hospital of the entire eastern region. As a level four medical institution, it should be able to deal with every form of treatment. The reality, however, is that it can barely cope with many of the basics.<br></p> <p>In the orthopaedic department, there are no weights for traction devices, so nurses used Coke and Pepsi bottles filled with water. Two dangle at the foot of the bed of Daniel Usman, whose femur was broken in a gang shootout. He says has been waiting two months for surgery because the blood bank does not have his type.

There used to be six working radiotherapy machines; now there are none. Of the 10 operating theatres, only two are in use, though only sporadically because it is often hard to find anaesthetics. The air conditioning is out of order. Only one lift works. The x-ray is functioning, but there there are no printing materials, so doctors have to diagnose and operate based on mobile phone photos of the screen.<br></p> <p>\u201cWe have to improvise like doctors in a war,\u201d says \u00c1lvarez who has been at the institution for more than five years.<br></p> <p>The battlefield analogy is made all the more appropriate by the ever-present fear of violence: staff and patients have been mugged in the hospital corridors. Five of the 10 doctors interviewed by the Guardian reported receiving death threats.</p> <p>\u201cThe insecurity in the hospital is worse than outside,\u201d said one. \u201cGangs have entered during surgery and started shooting. They said if the patient cannot be saved, then we will be killed,\u201d said another. \u201cTwo months ago, I was threatened with a grenade,\u201d says a third.<br></p> <p>But this pales in comparison to the dangers faced by the most seriously ill patients: children who cannot get adequate food, or cancer patients who are unable to get the appropriate chemotherapy treatments.<br></p> <p>Nationwide, the Health Observatory believes <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/24/venezuela-crisis-basic-food-shortages\">malnutrition is the biggest worry</a>, causing 29 child deaths every day and stunting of 35% of poor rural infants. </p> <p>Until recently, the hospital in Barcelona only had a few cases of kwashiorkor (a deficiency of proteins, which leads to distended stomachs), but now for the first time, they are also seeing children with the more serious marasmus (starvation that causes emaciation and diarrhoea).</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The insecurity in the hospital is worse than outside \u2026 Gangs have entered during surgery and started shooting</p> <footer> <cite>A doctor at Lu\u00eds Razetti hospital</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cIt has become much worse in the past year. I have seen about 20 cases of marasmus in the last few months. We are also seeing dozens of cases of extreme weight loss,\u201d said \u00c1lvarez. </p> <p>Doctors have also accused the government of downplaying the threat of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/zika-virus\">Zika virus</a>. While neighbouring Brazil and Colombia publish weekly updates of confirmed cases, President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro has largely kept quiet about the virus. And while other countries in Latin America have reported hundreds of cases of Zika-related microcephaly, Venezuela has not acknowledged a single one. </p> <p>Diphtheria is making a comeback, although Venezuela had been the first country in Latin America to eradicate the disease. The first few fatalities from the disease were confirmed in Bol\u00edvar state earlier this month. Since then, there have been between 17 and 22 deaths, according to local media.

Thanks to its charitable foundation, the Jos\u00e9 Manuel de los R\u00edos hospital is one of the best-resourced medical institutions in the country, but it is also chronically short of drugs, staff and equipment.</p> <p>Since 2005, the number of paediatricians is down from 10 to three, oncologists down from eight to four and there are 30% fewer nurses</p> <p>Augusto Pereira, the head of the oncology department, said the mortality rate of patients had increased 5% in the past year. Infection rates are also creeping up due to shortages of staff, medicine and sterilisation equipment. Only one elevator is working. Two cats wander the corridors.</p> <p>\u201cTechnically, our hospital should be closed. In other countries, we would be shut down. But in Venezuela, we are the best,\u201d Pereira says.</p> <p>Due to a shortage of anaesthetists and operating theatres, there are only 15 to 20 paediatric operations a month, down from 100 in the past. Doctors are forced to argue with one another whose patients deserve priority.</p> <p>\u201cPeople are dying every day because of the delays,\u201d said paediatric surgeon Alejandro Ferrer. \u201cWe have to wait until the patients get enough money for the examinations, then we do the diagnosis, then we have to wait for at least three weeks for an chance to do surgery. If you delay the treatment of a cancer patient, they are going to die.\u201d</p> <p>Others suffer a collapse in quality of life. Fifteen-year old Jaidiluz Pastrana was born with neurological problems, severe spina bifida and a cleft palate and is also now suffering hypertension and urinary infection because the hospital has run out of diuretics and catheters. \u201cI\u2019ve lost count of how many drug stores I have been to in the past week, but there is nothing,\u201d her mother Luzmery Hurtade laments. \u201cA year ago, I could have found what I needed, but not now.\u201d<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In other countries, we would be shut down.

Ever since the draw was made <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/pep-guardiola\">Pep Guardiola</a>\u2019s homecoming has been the standout attraction of the Champions League group stage but City supporters must be wondering which of his sides is going to turn up.

For all their financial might they are not head and shoulders above the rest in England. No one is, and that is the point. There are up to half a dozen title contenders in the Premier League, and teams in mid-table or even relegation trouble can pack a punch. Some people suggested in advance Guardiola would not find it easy to be an instant success and on the basis of the last couple of results they are claiming to have been proved right. A tougher overall league appears to be finding Guardiola out.</p> <p>Except he begs to differ. When it was put to him <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/15/barcelona-deportivo-la-coruna-la-liga-match-report\">Barcelona had run out easy winners against Deportivo</a> on the same day City were resorting to using Vincent Kompany as a battering ram against Everton without success, Guardiola\u2019s annoyance was plain. \u201cI hear a lot of times about the intensity of the Premier League but none of you have been on the field in La Liga to know of the intensity there,\u201d he said. \u201cIn Germany too the intensity is amazing. You have to have respect for the other leagues. In Spain over the last few years the teams keep arriving in the finals of the major competitions because they are good players. Maybe the problem here is playing more games. Leagues in Spain, Germany and Italy all have intensity.\u201d</p> <p>Guardiola could have a point about playing too many games.

Guardiola seems as fed up with continually being asked whether De Bruyne can be as good as Messi as he is with suggestions that top teams in Spain and Germany somehow have it easier than their English counterparts. The one thing on which everyone can agree is Barcelona are a top team and, for all the excellent players at Guardiola\u2019s disposal, City are not quite at their level yet. That is what we think now, at any rate. If perceptions are about to be changed, Camp Nou is a good place to start and Guardiola a handy manager to have in charge.</p> <p>Even if his team struggle to score from the penalty spot, Guardiola has begun well in England. He has been in the country only a few months and his team are top of the Premier League and unbeaten in Europe. So much for the prologue. The next chapter starts here.</p>",

She wants it to be a \u201cspace which allows us to show art, to curate dialogues, have readings, and talk about the ways in which the structure of white supremacy in American society influences our culture.\u201d These, it\u2019s safe to say, are not the organizing questions of most of the art spaces in New York City.</p> <p>To Rankine, it\u2019s important to have the institute in downtown Manhattan, because \u201cthis is where those discussions begin\u201d and \u201cit has to be in the same playing field\u201d as the world\u2019s major galleries, like <a href=\"http://www.gagosian.com/\">Gagosian</a> or <a href=\"http://www.pacegallery.com/\">Pace</a>. While she admits that galleries \u201cmight not be altering legislation\u201d, Rankine is spot-on in understanding that \u201cculture really does determine what we think [and] how we think about things.\u201d</p> <p>Rankine is extremely interested in whiteness, believing that \u201cit\u2019s important that people begin to understand that whiteness is not inevitable, and that white dominance is not inevitable.\u201d One reason Rankine wants such a center to exist is because she recently went into a bookstore at the Los Angeles Contemporary Museum of Art \u201cand I asked them for books on whiteness. The man was like, \u2018What?\u2019</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There\u2019s a lot of ways to think about whiteness... it involves the kind of underbelly that has been kept from the public</p> <footer> <cite>Claudia Rankine</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cI said, \u2018Well, you know. Books that address the ways in which white contemporary artists deal with whiteness, interrogate it, analyze it, work in ways that push up with constructions of whiteness.\u2019 He\u2019s like, \u2018I don\u2019t know what you mean.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Rankine had a similar conversation in three different bookstores. While she knew they would have had books on African American art, these art bookshops never had anything to deconstruct race in general or whiteness in particular.</p> <p>\u201cConceptions and constructions of whiteness,\u201d she explained, have been \u201cmade and then propped up with eugenics and propped up with false science and false rhetoric and maintained through the justice system in every way\u201d. They then become invisible. As writers and artists, she said, \u201cit\u2019s our job to point this out, because I really believe that people don\u2019t know\u201d \u2013 about what makes whiteness, or about how broad the life experiences of white people are.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of other ways to start thinking about whiteness, and it involves the kind of underbelly that has been kept from the American public,\u201d Rankine said. She told me about a photograph she took outside of the <a href=\"http://www.drc.ohio.gov/orw\">Ohio Reformatory for Women </a>last summer.</p> <p>\u201cThis prison is 80% white women and 19% black women. One percent other. But when I say to people 80% of the women in this prison are white rural women, they\u2019re shocked. And they\u2019re shocked because that information is kept from them. It\u2019s kept from them because it doesn\u2019t bolster the ideas that blackness equals criminality. It\u2019s contrary to that. It doesn\u2019t enforce the idea that white people should be afraid of black people and not afraid of each other.\u201d </p> <p>This is a white America that we don\u2019t see in media, Rankine said, except in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/oct/18/bryan-cranston-i-was-walter-white-a-life-in-parts-breaking-bad\">Breaking Bad</a>. (And even there, \u201cthe only way that whiteness equals criminality\u201d was when \u201ca dying white guy who only broke the law so he could take care of his family\u201d.) Rankine said she is always being told that she must watch <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/orange-is-the-new-black\">Orange is the New Black</a>, a show that does bolster the idea that black is criminal and a white woman is out of place in jail. </p> <p>While Rankine acknowledges how people of color are disproportionately incarcerated, she is also interested in \u201cthe reality of who is actually incarcerated by the numbers\u201d (white people) and thinks it would be fascinating to see a show about a black woman locked up with a whole lotta white women in the mid-west. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>How is it one is able to move through life with a level of sameness? Is that conscious?</p> <footer> <cite>Claudia Rankine</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I ask Rankine about two of the most talked about speeches about race and art in the past year: her <a href=\"http://www.vulture.com/2016/04/claudia-rankine-keynote-apw.html\">viral keynote speech</a> at the American Writers and Writing Programs conference in April, in which she called out the racism of writing programs, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/13/lionel-shrivers-full-speech-i-hope-the-concept-of-cultural-appropriation-is-a-passing-fad\">Lionel Shriver\u2019s speech at the Brisbane Literary Festival</a>, in which she ridiculed the idea of \u201ccultural appropriation\u201d while wearing a sombrero. Rankine won\u2019t initially talk about Shriver because \u201cshe doesn\u2019t have the work behind it. If she had the work, then I would engage.\u201d She is, however, interested in the views of \u201csomebody like Jonathan Franzen,\u201d as she acknowledges the seriousness of his writing.</p> <p>\u201cHe said something like \u2018I can\u2019t write about people I don\u2019t know.\u2019 That, to me, is more complex. So, why don\u2019t you know these people? What choices have you made in your life to keep yourself segregated? How is it one is able to move through life with a level of sameness? Is that conscious? Is segregation forever really at the bottom of everything? When he says something like that, I find that really interesting as an admittance to white privilege: that he can get through his life without any meaningful interaction with people of color.\u201d </p> <p>These, to Rankine, are questions worth thinking about, because they form a \u201cmore critical evaluation of one\u2019s own habits and one\u2019s own positionality relative to making art and doing work.\u201d By contrast, \u201cGetting up and putting on a sombrero and saying, \u2018I can do what I want. I have the right to do what I want,\u2019 to me is missing the point. What would be interesting would be to talk about why is it in the language of rights? Like, white people should have more stuff? ... \u2018It\u2019s my right to take what I want?\u2019 Isn\u2019t that the history of colonialism? It\u2019s my right to take resources. It\u2019s my right to take land. It\u2019s my right to have slaves.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Rankine\u2019s presence is extremely intentional: you can watch her forming her words carefully, so that spoken sentences come out particularly and poetically. She is sensitive to the experiences of people of color in almost everything she says and writes. We discussed the concept of <a href=\"https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/handle/2027.42/45356/11013_2005_Article_BF01379448.pdf?sequence=1\">John Henryism</a>, a biological medical reason for why black people die younger than white people developed by <a href=\"http://news.sanford.duke.edu/news-type/news/2014/sherman-james-career-crossroads-disciplines\">Sherman James</a>, which I first learned about when reading Citizen. Rankine says she appreciates how James could make visible the ways that for \u201cpeople of color in the United States, so much effort has to go into negotiating the day-to-day, beyond the regular random things that comes into a life, that the tendencies for chronic ailments towards that shouldn\u2019t be a surprise to anybody. It\u2019s a lot of stress that one is carrying \u2013 if you think your child could be shot dead, or you\u2019ll be the first one to lose your job, or you won\u2019t get an interview simply because you\u2019re black.\u201d </p> <p>Nevertheless, much of Rankine\u2019s new work will focus on whiteness. She is currently working on a play \u201cin conversation with\u201d Citizen. \u201cThere\u2019s a dinner party. The dinner party is where many things get talked about. The people in the play are in the art world. You\u2019ll recognize passages from Citizen, but it is not an attempt to stage Citizen.\u201d </p> <p>Her next book, which is just starting to take shape, will be \u201cdoing a lot of work on white construction and understanding the trajectory, historically, from the 1700s to now and seeing that the stories are the same.\u201d She\u2019s especially interested in comparing two phenomena. \u201cThe <a href=\"http://encyclopedia.densho.org/Naturalization_Act_of_1790/\">1790 naturalization act </a>was an attempt to limit who could govern and keep people away from self governance.\u201d Over 200 years later followed \u201cthe <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/jul/28/birther-movement-obama-citizenship\">birther movement</a>, which was all about \u2018Where\u2019s your birth certificate?\u2019 You have no right to the White House.</p> <p>\u201cThere are no new tricks out there,\u201d she adds. \u201cThe same mechanisms to keep people out are in play over and over again.\u201d </p> <p>Thinking about the racial imaginary has also led her to track down transcripts of police killings, \u201cbecause so many of these videos where somebody says \u2018Why did you shoot me?\u201d and the person says, \u2018I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know.\u2019 I\u2019m interested in moving the lens onto these white men and women who really are being put in positions that they don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p> <p>Rankine says she understands why people don\u2019t want to focus on whiteness. \u201cI think we\u2019ve seen whiteness centralized forever, so they\u2019re no longer interested in making it the subject, putting it in the subject position. But I think that it\u2019s been centralized in order to continue its dominance, and it\u2019s never been the object of inquiry to understand its paranoia, its violence, its rage.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Banks are boring, for a good reason. The last thing you want to hear from the organisation you\u2019ve entrusted with your money is their exciting plans for how to shake up the world of finance. Generally, you want a beige person in beige clothes gesturing to whatever is the digital equivalent of a big vault filled with gold. It\u2019s boring, it\u2019s reassuring, it\u2019s safe.</p> <p>Banks are, in short, the opposite of a tech startup. So a tech startup wanting to take on the banks on their own turf has its work cut out for it.</p> <p>But that\u2019s the goal of London-based firm Monzo (n\u00e9e Mondo: the company had to change its name this year after a trademark challenge). The company doesn\u2019t just want to become a new bank, though. It <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2015/jun/29/digital-banking-mondo-hopes-to-become-the-google-or-facebook-of-the-sector\">wants to become the Facebook of banking</a>, with a billion users worldwide, bypassing much of the traditional banking infrastructure in the process to become something the world has never seen.</p> <p>That\u2019s a long way away, though. In the present, Monzo is operating in a limited beta test, with 50,000 cardholders using the service through pre-paid debit cards. It just got a restricted banking licence, putting it on the path to opening up a full current account service in early 2017 (as well as granting it deposit protection, faster payments and direct debits).</p> <p>That puts it a step behind some other so-called challenger banks, including Atom and Tandem, which received their own licences this year. Nonetheless, Monzo has received the lion\u2019s share of the attention given to the sector, owing to the scale of the firm\u2019s ambition.</p> <h2>Building a bank from the ground up</h2> <p>It\u2019s not just a result of founder Tom Blomfield\u2019s goal \u201cto get to 1 billion customers\u201d, and subsequent plans for international expansion before the company has even fully launched in the UK (Monzo is \u201ctesting US dollar and Euro cards right now\u201d, he says). It\u2019s also because, where its competitors have largely been positioning themselves as innovative banks, focusing on the cost savings afforded without the overheads of branches, and highlighting their competitive deals, Monzo has focused more on the wider possibilities offered by building a bank from the ground up in the 21st century.</p> <p>Blomfield\u2019s ambition can get ahead of him at times, leaving it hard to disentangle possibilities from plans, and plans from actually existing products. So here\u2019s what Monzo is today: a pre-paid MasterCard, issued by Wirecard Solutions, with deep hooks into a companion app which offers a real-time log of your spending and control over how the card is used.</p> <p>The real-time log is impressive for anyone who\u2019s had to wait days for online banking to update to find out how much they spent after a boozy night out, and Blomfield proudly points out that it would be impossible for a \u201clegacy bank\u201d to do the same. \u201cIf you slap this app on top of NatWest\u2019s systems, the phone wouldn\u2019t buzz when you make the transaction. It would buzz three days later, when the bank finally posted to its ledger.\u201d</p> <p>Other pre-paid accounts are more real-time, and Blomfield concedes that American Express also offers that speed of response. But, he says, \u201cthe amount of information that we ingest and show is a hundred times greater\u201d than even new payment networks. That means that not only can the app show you what you spent, it can tag it to the physical location of the store, pull the logo of the brand, and let you sort your spending by location, category, or cost.</p> <p>He pulls out his phone, and shows me an example: \u201cThis McDonalds. I was still on holiday at the time, so it\u2019s tagged it as holidays. The fact that it can geolocate it, show the address, the name, the logo. It tells me I\u2019ve been, embarrassingly, four times to the McDonalds, and spent \u00a325. The fact that you can search and say to show me everywhere you\u2019ve been in San Francisco. The data isn\u2019t there in a legacy bank. You can put it in a shiny app, but the actual functionality isn\u2019t there.\u201d</p> <p>There are other draws, concerning safety and security. The app allows a user to freeze and unfreeze cards at will \u2013 perfect for those \u201cwhere\u2019s my wallet?! Oh, there it is\u201d moments \u2013 and can report when and why transactions fail as well as when they succeed.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"57434c74aaafaf70c94b7f4ed5da59a6e12e813a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/57434c74aaafaf70c94b7f4ed5da59a6e12e813a/0_122_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A customer uses an ATM machine outside National Australia Bank in Sydney.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A customer uses an ATM machine outside National Australia Bank in Sydney. Uk banks charge for overseas transactions, whereas Monzo does not.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Saeed Khan/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For users of Monzo today, then, that\u2019s most of the tech on offer. The other major draw is the fact that the service offers fee-free, 0% commission use overseas, something Blomfield gets quite excited about as he checks his own bank account for comparison. \u201cLet\u2019s see how much Natwest charge me on similar transactions. ATM transaction \u2026 oh my god. So, for a \u00a3100 transaction, about \u00a35.60 in charges, and then an exchange rate that\u2019s way off.</p> <p>\u201cAnd we charge nothing. There are some companies where that\u2019s a USP, but I question whether that\u2019s a long-term viable business model. The trend with FX [foreign exchange] is it will go very low, or zero, and I think the bank of the future needs to offer FX at basically zero, but it\u2019s very hard to build a defensible model around zero price, because once you have, where do you go?\u201d</p> <p>Where you go is where the distinction between plans and possibilities comes in. Here\u2019s the plan: a full current account service, launching in 2017, that takes Monzo from being a curiosity to something people can genuinely have at the heart of their financial lives. It also gives the company the chance to actually start making revenue, as those accounts will come with an overdraft facility.</p> <p>Notably, Monzo\u2019s genesis as a full bank both begins and ends there. The company has no ambitions to grow beyond the current account, to offer the full panoply of financial services, from mortgages and loans through savings accounts and investment advice. Instead, Blomfield wants the end stage of Monzo to be the hub for a 21st century \u201cportfolio bank\u201d, letting customers easily hook in, say, FX transactions from TransferWise, online investment from Nutmeg, and loans from FundingCircle.</p> <h2>The possibilities are endless \u2013 kind of</h2> <p>That\u2019s the plan. The possibilities, though, are \u2026 well, not endless. But there\u2019s a lot of them. Blomfield enthuses about the doors unlocked by access to financial data alone: your bank could compare your heating bill with those of comparable houses, and automatically notify you if it\u2019s found a better deal. With an open-access finance infrastructure, it could even switch for you, just by sending an API call to British Gas.</p> <p>And while the lean model of Monzo leaves no room for simple offers like cashback or reward points (something which causes the departure of around 5% of customers, Blomfield says, who quit to return to using American Express cards for the majority of their spending), there\u2019s the possibility of smarter deals that offer the same premium to the customer. He likens it to the advertising world before Google and Facebook came on the scene, when advertisers would struggle to discover the return on their investment. Now, advertisers pay less to advertise more effectively, customers get more relevant ads \u2013 and Google and Facebook make billions.</p> <p>Blomfield also wants Monzo to become the first bank to fully leverage the network effect of the internet: the characteristic, shared by sites like Facebook and technologies like the telephone, which means they become more useful the more people use them. He\u2019s got small ideas to start, like the ability to split bills automatically between every Monzo user at the meal at the point of payment, but they\u2019re already very different from what the wider banking industry expects. It\u2019s not normal to try to get your friends to switch to your bank so you can both use a cool new feature, but Monzo hopes to change that.</p> <p>The question for the bank\u2019s future is how many of those possibilities can crystallise into plans, and then projects, and then, eventually, features. That very uncertainty is what makes Monzo a tech company, not a bank: as Blomfield puts it, \u201cmost people don\u2019t worry that their bank will announce one day that it\u2019s pivoting to become a social network for cats.\u201d Not that Monzo will make that change; but Blomfield says that he would be surprised if it was substantially the same company in 10 years as it is now.</p> <p>For some, that will be terrifying to hear from someone who is simultaneously pitching to hold all their money and route all their transactions. For others, it\u2019s the point.</p> <p>\u201cWhen we launched,\u201d Blomfield says, \u201cthe first three or four thousand people, they had to physically come to our office and actually hear a presentation from me. I stood up and said \u2018it\u2019s not ready yet. This is not a bank account, it\u2019s a beta of a bank account, it\u2019s a pre-paid card. Don\u2019t rely on it, always carry a back up, it may break, but as a result, you get to experience a taste of the future.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>The pitch worked on me. I have a Mondo card in my wallet right now. Who doesn\u2019t want a taste of the future?</p>",

Case studies in the report describe children in schools being targeted and intimidated under Prevent for expressing political views. In UK universities \u2013 considered by many to be bastions of academic freedom \u2013 Prevent is apparently leading to the cancellation of conferences and debates about Islamophobia, and students are being targeted for reading course materials on terrorism.</p> <p>Conversations about terrorism are being driven underground, where they are less likely to be challenged. In healthcare facilities, doctors fear that their obligation to report patients to the authorities is in conflict with their duty of confidentiality and will undermine the doctor-patient relationship. One psychologist quoted in the report says, \u201cwe are being encouraged to police thought crimes and political opinions\u201d and describes another psychologist being fed questions by Prevent officers to ask her patient.</p> <p>For these reasons, we are calling for the repeal of the Prevent duty in health and education so that frontline professionals can be free to get on with their jobs and apply their professional judgment to respond appropriately to cases that genuinely warrant intervention.</p> <p>A particularly troubling case study in the report describes an organisation collecting names and sensitive political information for the Home Office \u2013 apparently under Prevent, and apparently without informed consent \u2013 from nine- and 10-year-old children from a predominantly Muslim area. A questionnaire distributed to the children to elicit their opinions is included in the report.</p> <p>It asked whether they agreed or disagreed with statements such as: \u201cI think most people respect my race or religion\u201d; \u201cPeople should be free to say what they like, even if it offends others\u201d; \u201cPeople from a different race, religion or community are just as good as people like me\u201d; and \u201cWomen are just as good as men at work\u201d. It also asked the children how much they trusted people of their race or religion, people of another race or religion, school teachers, police officers, journalists and the UK government. Would these children have been targeted in this manner had they not been predominantly Muslim?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/apr/04/prevent-hate-muslims-schools-terrorism-teachers-reject\">Prevent gives people permission to hate Muslims \u2013 it has no place in schools | Fahid Qurashi</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In a climate of intense anti-Muslim sentiment, the report argues, Prevent gives frontline professionals broad discretion to act on their conscious and unconscious biases. The report notes that the government\u2019s own figures show that in the past, <a href=\"http://mend.org.uk/channel-safeguarding-or-stigmatising-young-children/\" title=\"\">80% of referrals to the police-led Channel programme were rejected</a>. Since the statutory \u201cPrevent duty\u201d took effect in 2015, the number of referrals to Channel has skyrocketed. The government\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/contest-uk-strategy-for-countering-terrorism-annual-report-for-2015\" title=\"\">annual report on Contest</a>, its <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CONTEST\" title=\"\">counterterrorism strategy</a>, notes that \u201cduring 2015, there were several thousand referrals to Channel; around 15% of these were linked to far-right extremism, and around 70% linked to Islamist-related extremism\u201d; but that of those referred, only \u201cseveral hundred\u201d were provided with support in 2015. This suggests that a significant number of individuals were wrongly referred.</p> <p>Unsurprisingly, Prevent is alienating many law-abiding Muslims wrongly targeted and causing them to question their place in British society. David Anderson QC, the independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, observed in his <a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/home-affairs-committee/news-parliament-2015/160115-countering-extremism-evidence/\" title=\"\">testimony before parliament\u2019s home affairs select committee</a> that \u201cPrevent has become a more significant source of grievance in affected communities than the police and ministerial powers \u2026 that are exercised under the Pursue strand of the Contest strategy\u201d. Prevent\u2019s alienating effect in turn undermines the ability of law enforcement officials to elicit the cooperation of Muslim communities for countering future terrorist attacks.</p> <p>There are parallels here with another policing issue affecting minority communities: the disproportionate use of stop and search. In 2014, Theresa May, then home secretary, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2014/apr/30/theresa-may-reform-police-stop-and-search-powers\" title=\"\">told parliament</a>: \u201cNobody wins when stop and search is misapplied. It is a waste of police time. It is unfair, especially to young, black men. It is bad for public confidence in the police.\u201d Surely the prime minister\u2019s words are also true for Prevent when it is misapplied to Muslims?</p>",

Given a chance by Thiago Silva\u2019s injury and Marquinhos\u2019s trip to the Olympics, Kimpembe has enjoyed an outstanding start to the season, establishing himself as a first choice and also earning a callup to the French squad.

He put on a one-man show \u2013 a mix of a TED talk with some populist Prairie Home Companion gags and prerecorded bits \u2013 and did his best to engage with undecided voters, third-party voters and, yes, even Trump voters.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"b602ae47a5208716631633d89a6d4626615fc6fb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b602ae47a5208716631633d89a6d4626615fc6fb/0_0_928_523/500.jpg\" alt=\"Michael Moore in Trumpland\" width=\"500\" height=\"282\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Michael Moore\u2019s surprise Trump documentary is \u2018an urgent, 73 minute call to arms to get out the vote for Clinton, mixed with some jokes\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: IFC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The resulting film is more like a shaggy dog Spalding Grey monologue than one of his satirical, incendiary documentaries like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2002/nov/15/artsfeatures4\">Bowling For Columbine</a> or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2009/dec/21/best-films-noughties-fahrenheit-911\">Fahrenheit 9/11</a>. </p> <p>\u201cWhat this country doesn\u2019t need is a horror movie about Donald Trump. He\u2019s producing that himself,\u201d Moore said. But get past the less successful gags and assertive crowd reaction shots, and Moore\u2019s central thesis is one that has been strangely absent from the conversation: everyone should be thrilled to vote for Hillary Clinton.</p> <p>What Moore does is work through his own troubled relationship with her. He hates that she voted for the Iraq war, and surely the director of Roger &amp; Me isn\u2019t thrilled with her ties to Wall Street. \u201cBut she\u2019s still the same woman who gave <a href=\"http://www.wellesley.edu/events/commencement/archives/1969commencement/studentspeech#JWElPTkJELWLjDqA.97\">that commencement address at Wellesley College</a>. And we\u2019ve got to hold her to that.\u201d</p> <p>Jokingly, he added that two years into her term, if she doesn\u2019t make good on her promises, he will run for president himself in 2020. But first we\u2019ve got to \u201cstop doing end-zone dances. That\u2019s going to get Trump elected. She is still the second most hated candidate in history, only behind Trump\u201d.</p> <p>Michael Moore In TrumpLand spends a great deal of time compassionately getting into the head of a would-be Trump voter in the \u201cBrexit states\u201d who deserves \u201cthe right to send a \u2018fuck you\u2019 vote\u201d. But he urged us all to \u201cmake a party\u201d of being able to have the first woman president and not \u201csomeone like Margaret fucking Thatcher\u201d.</p> <p>Moore\u2019s lengthy post-screening chat was a bit of a roller coaster. For starters, he seemed exhausted, having just finished editing at 7am that day. He got emotional discussing his late mother, who chose to work at a time when wives and mothers just didn\u2019t do that. He explained how the act of voting for Obama (and seeing his middle name Hussein on the ballot) caused him to sob, thus smudging his check mark. </p> <p>He also went on a tangent about the reality television show The Bachelorette, because, at heart, Moore will always be an entertainer and a showman \u2013 the type of guy who can get Twitter trending for a full day for the release of a monologue encouraging people to vote for a candidate they may not be too enthusiastic about.</p> <p>\u201cIf you leave and think, \u2018Oh this was just a funny show\u2019, I\u2019ve failed,\u201d he warned. </p>",

Not that Joyce has disagreed with Turnbull\u2019s messages. But his National MPs have tried to remind everyone that this is a matter of categorisation of the gun - not the import. Because a number of the shotguns are already in the country. It looks like a Lib-Nat split.</p> <p><strong>Tony Abbott\u2019s </strong>revelation that the sunset clause on the import ban was a result of internal pressure from the National party and presumably some Libs, rather than Leyonhjelm, reinforces the \u201csplit\u201d story for the PM. Nationals have confirmed they did push back on Abbott. Whether Keenan plus Dutton independently used the agreed sunset clause to barter with Leyonhjelm (given it was going to happen anyway) or whether Abbott gave permission to do so, we don\u2019t know.</p> <p>So if the import ban is lifted \u2013 as at least some of the Nats would like \u2013 it will be painted as a watering down of the gun laws. Even though strictly speaking, it is not. It will also be painted as a win for the Nats over Turnbull.</p> <p><strong>Enter WA premier Colin Barnett</strong>. He has said this:<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I\u2019m far from being an expert on guns, but as a matter of policy, I do not support that gun. I saw some footage on television of it being fired; it\u2019s obviously got a rapid-fire capacity. Australia has put in policies to contain gun ownership and use, and I do not support allowing a weapon like that into this state.</p> </blockquote> <p>If Barnett is going to be a hold-out on the Adler, it may be the best political outcome for Turnbull. It could both fix the wider political issue and his issue with the Nats.</p> <p>If the states cannot decide on the category \u2013 as they are required to do under the National Firearms Agreement \u2013 the import ban stays for the time being. This would solve the wider political problem by kicking it off into the long grass. The PM can tell the Nats his hands are tied by the states indecision \u2013 that is the condition of the Howard laws. </p> <p>As an aside, shooters who favour the import of the Adler are privately pretty ropable with Leyonjhelm. He has put the Adler squarely in the middle of a wider political debate, ensuring it will not be discussed in any sort of rational way. But Leyonjhelm wins either way. If the shotgun is permanently banned, he fought the good fight for shooters.

  "<p>Before long, Santiago could be a city full of electric vehicles charged by \u201csmart\u201d power grids, many of them driving on highways equipped with traffic-reducing automated variable toll pricing. Perhaps a new arrival to the Chilean capital would go for the chance to found a technology company, incentivised by programmes like the state-backed, foreigner-friendly Start-Up Chile, in <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/node/21564589\">\u201cChilecon Valley\u201d</a>. And perhaps they\u2019ll stay for the capital\u2019s reputation boasting the most advanced public transit system in Latin America.</p> <p>Or they might opt for Africa instead of South America, to take advantage of the assistance offered by organisations like <a href=\"http://www.smartxchange.co.za/index.html\">SmartXchange</a> in Durban.

Its lack of resources, small size and high population density have demanded innovative solutions to age-old logistical and environmental urban problems, and its wealth and top-down government control have made those solutions feasible.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Life in Tokyo can feel frustratingly low-tech as often as thrillingly hi-tech</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Singapore, which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/apr/21/story-cities-singapore-carefully-planned-lee-kuan-yew\">integrates technology and urban planning</a> to a unique degree, pioneered the hi-tech solution to the complications of urban life.

In collaboration with Barcelona-based universities, Spanish automaker Seat has got to work converting existing parking facilities into hi-tech, service intensive, transit oriented \u201cmicrocities\u201d.<br></p> <p>But perhaps the most technologically promising European capital is on the other end of the continent: Tallinn, Estonia, the birthplace of Skype. The country <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/21/e-stonia-country-using-technology-to-rebrand-itself-as-the-anti-russia\">plowed all the resources it could into information technology</a> after gaining its independence in 1991, and it shows: signs point to the nearest hotspot where one can tap into the high-speed data services available, well before they made it to the US and the UK. Over a decade ago, Tallinn became the first city to hold elections online, through the same system citizens use to pay their taxes and view all government data pertaining to them.

However, the country has announced intentions of clearing up some of these issues by the time of the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang.</p> <p>The fruits of humanity\u2019s now seemingly constant technological revolutions and the living patterns of our urban population currently integrate nowhere better than they do in Seoul. Yet the title of the world\u2019s most hi-tech city could go anywhere in the next decade: to a city about to emerge triumphantly from the developing world, to a historic capital that has turned to the future, to a slick development that has settled into its urban identity \u2026 or to some place as yet barely imagined.<br></p> <p><em>Follow Guardian Cities on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/guardiancities\">Twitter</a> and <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/guardiancities\">Facebook</a> and join the discussion</em></p>",

In all, it now has 1,000 members and 19 elected officials.</p> <p>Moyer-Lee is a US citizen. His involvement in trade unions stems from his student days at Soas University of London. While there, as a fluent Spanish speaker, (he also speaks French, Portuguese, Italian and a smattering of Arabic and Chichewa) he helped the university\u2019s cleaners \u2013 mostly from South America, many of whom had come to England on Spanish passports \u2013 improve their English. He then helped Unison\u2019s 2011 campaign to get the <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/student/news/victory-cleaning-staff-strike-at-university-of-london-wins-major-concessions-on-pay-and-conditions-8972785.html\" title=\"\">outsourced cleaners, security and maintenance staff at the University of London</a> the London living wage.</p> <p>Following that campaign\u2019s success, as a student activist Moyer-Lee helped organise the <a href=\"http://www.lrb.co.uk/blog/2013/12/03/harry-stopes/not-a-recognised-union/\" title=\"\">3 Cosas campaign</a>. This successfully argued that there were three areas where disparity between university staff and contract workers was greatest and that they should also get the same sick pay, holidays and pension rights as direct employees of the university. The 3 Cosas campaign developed within the university branch of Unison, but in April 2013 many of the workers joined the IWGB.</p> <p>The bicycle couriers\u2019 tribunal cases are the culmination of 18 months\u2019 efforts to improve their working conditions.

If we are not careful, tomorrow we will wake up and none of us will have the minimum wage, sick pay or paid holidays. The IWGB has been at the forefront of the struggle for decent working conditions for these low-paid workers and we will continue to fight until everyone has decent working rights.\u201d</p> <p>But Moyer-Lee\u2019s efforts to help the low paid nearly came at the expense of his right to stay in the UK. After completing his PhD, he applied for a graduate entrepreneur visa to enable him to remain in the UK when his student visa expired at the end of 2014. Under the scheme, graduates from oustide the EU with a credible business proposal are sponsored by their university for an application to remain. Soas <a href=\"https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/soas-research-assistant-claims-bias-in-visa-decision/2017390.article\" title=\"\">initially turned Moyer-Lee down</a> and he could have been deported, until the decision was reversed. From a workers\u2019 rights perspective, he believes leaving the EU will be \u201ca total disaster\u201d. European courts tend to be more generous in their interpretation of statutes as they relate to workers\u2019 rights than UK courts, he points out. And without the EU blocking it, \u201cthere\u2019s nothing to prevent future Tory governments from shredding rights\u201d, he adds. Furthermore, UK workers won\u2019t benefit from any new protections the EU introduces. And as many of the IWGB\u2019s members have Spanish passports, Brexit&#xa0;will \u201cdisproportionately\u201d affect its members.</p> <p>Moyer-Lee is very committed to helping the lowest paid, but is aware this makes the IWGB reliant on donors and grants to top up its funding.

  "<p>Ah yes, <strong>Ordinary Lies</strong> (BBC1), the workplace drama that zooms in on a different character and their troubled life each episode, back for a second series. Lies, not \u201clives\u201d you see, so what you see at work isn\u2019t the whole picture. I remember, in the first series, Jason Manford telling his colleagues that his wife had died to avoid getting the sack \u2013 quite a big ask of the viewer.</p> <p>That was set in a car dealership; now we\u2019re at the head office and warehouse of a sportswear company. So maybe it will be a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/09/sports-direct-warehouse-work-conditions\" title=\"\">zero-hours sweatshop</a> with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/22/mike-ashley-running-sports-direct-like-victorian-workhouse\" title=\"\">Victorian conditions and practices for the workers,</a> and a place on the Forbes List for the boss?</p> <p>Anyway, here\u2019s Joe (Con O\u2019Neill), head of sales, arriving at work in the Audi, accompanied by the Dandy Warhols: Yeah I like you yeah I like you, And I feel <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CU3mc0yvRNk\" title=\"\">whoa ho woo</a>. People seem to like Joe too yeah, he\u2019s pretty whoa ho woo himself, less Mike Ashley more David Brent.

That was Swansea, this is Cardiff.</p> <p>He tells a joke (<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/2eecbc/there_was_an_inflatable_boy/\" title=\"\">the one about the inflatable school</a>) as he strides into the office, with people criss-crossing and walking about all over the place that way television drama often does to make a place look busy (Where are they&#xa0;all going? Real offices aren\u2019t \u2013 even&#xa0;The Office isn\u2019t \u2013 like that; people&#xa0;sit down, mostly, at their desks). There\u2019s plenty of workplace bants, a bit of dressing up, then \u2013 during a lapse in health and safety \u2013 an&#xa0;accident in the warehouse. A forklift&#xa0;crashes into a stack of stock boxes, which topple on to Joe\u2019s head, he\u2019s OK,&#xa0;but sent home \u2026</p> <p>Where he finds his wife Belinda (who should be at work), acting suspiciously. She\u2019s having an affair, is what Joe immediately thinks, obviously. There were some flirty texts&#xa0;with a fella at her workplace, last time he checked her phone), and now she has changed her pin. But how is he going to check up on her, Joe wonders, looking up at the ceiling (he\u2019s back in the office now), noticing a CCTV camera, and another over there, and there, and there \u2026</p> <p>OK, OK, I get it. To catch the missus in the act, Joe\u2019s thinking of installing CCTV cameras, in his own house. Which he does, hidden in the smoke alarms. Turns out, Belinda\u2019s not having an affair \u2026 well, she probably is, with Mr Well-hung SMS from work, but that\u2019s not the main issue here. She is a&#xa0;vigilante paedophile hunter; you know, one of those people who go fishing on the internet, pose as children to lure the paedophiles from their lairs, then confront them with a camera at the meeting and put it all on YouTube.&#xa0;This has come about as a&#xa0;result of something very bad&#xa0;that happened to their daughter.</p> <p>There\u2019s a further complication: on&#xa0;his spy-cam, Joe spies his 16-year-old son with his girlfriend, who isn\u2019t yet 16. Then, at work, there\u2019s another tangentially&#xa0;related story, about a recent divorcee (who I imagine will feature in&#xa0;a later episode) hitting on the troubled work-experience boy \u2013 who&#xa0;is&#xa0;past the age of consent. It\u2019s legal, but&#xa0;there might be question marks about the morality of it.</p> <p>It\u2019s all too much for Joe, who takes another tumble, off the wagon this time. Oh, yeah, he\u2019s an alcoholic, driven to it by what happened to his daughter. Wow, that\u2019s a lot (too much?)&#xa0;to hit us with. There\u2019s something of that opening office scene&#xa0;about it, with&#xa0;new revelations and issues and&#xa0;lies suddenly criss-crossing and coming in in all directions, and, again, it\u2019s quite a lot to ask of the viewer, in terms of&#xa0;plausibility.</p> <p>Con O\u2019Neill is convincing, though, and excellent. And Ordinary Lies does&#xa0;ask some interesting moral questions, about relative evil and similar crimes, about revenge, about how well you know the people closest&#xa0;to you. And about snooping, and whether it\u2019s better to know something you\u2019d rather not know, or&#xa0;never to find out.</p> <p>I think the former; and it turns out these smoke-detector cams are a real thing. So excuse me while I just fit some spy cameras in my smoke alarms \u2026 Oh, there appears to be a camera already in this one, and now I\u2019m thinking about levels of trust and whether that might be an issue in my own relationship, while flicking Vs at the ceiling. Yeah, have that, Big Brother.</p>",

Because if you said to somebody that there was legislation in the UK that stopped good schools from opening or expanding they would say: \u2018What on earth are you doing?\u2019</p> <p>\u201cWe also have to recognise that in this country we have selection, but it is selection by house price and ability to pay.

Coming soon, perhaps: \u201cWhy can\u2019t we get the 99% we deserve?\u201d</p> <p>I heartily agree that Nigel Farage and Trump are grotesques. But the free-traders peddle their own untruths. They have insisted that black is white, even as the voters beg to differ. In their seminar rooms, their TV studios and their Geneva offices, they have perpetrated the ideological sleight of hand that equates internationalism with free trade, and globalisation with untrammelled corporate power. The result has been misery for workers from Bolton to Baltimore to Bangladesh. But it has also left the six-figure technocrats who supervise our economic system pushing a zombie idea. Because that is what free trade has become: an idea leached of life and meaning but stumbling on for want of any replacement. We have a globalisation for bankers, but not for children fleeing the bombs of Syria. Security for investors but not for workers.</p> <p>To see how debased the notion of free trade has become, look at the deal between Canada and the EU that is currently being voted through Europe\u2019s parliaments. It\u2019s called the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/06/transatlantic-trade-partnership-ttip-canada-eu\">Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement</a> (Ceta), and the fact that you can see it at all is largely down to leaks of the documents, which forced the European commission to publish,. That is after the negotiations were conducted for five years in secret, with even the <a href=\"http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2015/12/15-eu-canada-trade-negotiating-mandate-made-public/\">directives kept hidden</a> from the hundreds of millions of citizens affected.</p> <p>This is no minor technical work. Provided it is passed in time, Ceta will apply to Britain too \u2013 and parts of it will affect Britons\u2019 lives even after we\u2019ve \u201ctaken back control\u201d. It has been billed as \u201ca backdoor for TTIP\u201d, the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, which <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2016/08/28/eus-ttip-trade-deal-with-the-us-has-collapsed-says-germany/\">collapsed this summer</a> amid public opposition both in Europe and the US. Like TTIP, Ceta includes the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jun/10/obscure-legal-system-lets-corportations-sue-states-ttip-icsid\">investor-state dispute settlement system</a> \u2013 which hands big business the power to sue governments, including for profits they haven\u2019t made yet. A US multinational with an office in Canada (nearly all of them) will be able to sue Britons for bringing in laws that lose them money. This was the mechanism tobacco giant <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/dec/18/australia-wins-international-legal-battle-with-philip-morris-over-plain-packaging\">Philip Morris used to sue Australia\u2019s government</a> for bringing in plain packaging. On that occasion, Big Tobacco was unsuccessful \u2013 but it took four years of expensive legal battle.</p> <p>Free trade used to be about tackling protectionism; now it\u2019s about protecting big business \u2013 against the public. If populists take a complex situation, offer a simple answer and warn any dissenters of gruesome consequences, then the free-traders are guilty of populism too. With Ceta or TTIP, it goes like this: if this deal goes through, then economies will grow, jobs will appear, and a rising tide will lift all boats, from super-yacht to rubber dinghy. That is pretty much what mainstream politicians of Europe \u2013 both left and right \u2013 and their officials are saying about the deal with Canada.</p> <p>In economic history, never mind that the biggest winners \u2013 whether the US in the early 1900s or China now \u2013 are those who break the free trade rules. Never mind that the actual forecasts for Ceta show the gains will be relatively meagre. Never mind that the studies cited don\u2019t bother to look at who wins and loses, and by how much.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>An auto engineer can up sticks and turn into a software engineer.

Eight years on, that bounceback hasn\u2019t materialised. <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/earningsandworkinghours/datasets/averageweeklyearningsearn01\">British workers are still not paid as much</a> after inflation as they were when Lehman Brothers collapsed.</p> <p>That assumption\u2019s lack of substance is called a \u201cdirty little secret\u201d by two independent economists, Pierre Kohler and Servaas Storm, in a <a href=\"http://www.ase.tufts.edu/gdae/Pubs/wp/16-03CETA.pdf\">recent paper</a> scrutinising the likely effects of Ceta. As they say, it presumes that laid-off workers \u201cwill rapidly find new jobs\u201d \u2013 whatever the industry, however far away the employer. A car engineer can up sticks and turn into a software engineer. And if there aren\u2019t any actual jobs, they can deliver takeaways for Deliveroo.</p> <p>The assumptions are both laughably far-fetched and, in the cost citizens are expected to bear, disgusting. No wonder the EU would rather there was as little public discussion as possible.</p> <p>Using a model employed by the UN, Kohler and Storm found that the benefits of Ceta become microscopic next to the costs. For at least the first seven years after the agreement is brought in, unemployment will rise, wages will fall and economies will see their growth rates decline. Governments will lose revenue, and so increase austerity.</p> <p>The burden will fall hardest on the poorest, the lowest-skilled, older people and those with disabilities. A senior lecturer at Delft University of Technology, Storm summed up for me the consequences: \u201cThe weaker your position in an economy, the more strongly you\u2019ll feel the fall-out.\u201d These aren\u2019t people and regions who are left behind: they\u2019ve been chucked off the train by their own governments. This is the settlement free-traders, left and right, are fighting to impose on voters. Is it any wonder the voters keep plumping for alternatives \u2013 no matter how reprehensible, how ruinous?</p> <p>\u2022 You can catch up on the discussion we had on this article and others on our <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/19/your-opinions-the-perils-of-globalisation-and-the-future-of-the-tory-left\">Your Opinions thread, which </a>is now closed.</p>",
  "<p>Hundreds of mammal species - from chimpanzees to hippos to bats - are being eaten into extinction by people, according to the first global assessment of the impact of human hunting.</p> <p>Bushmeat has long been a traditional source of food for many rural people, but as roads have been driven into remote areas, large-scale commercial hunting is leaving forests and other habitats devoid of wildlife. </p> <p>The scientists behind the new analysis warned that, without action, the wiping out of these species could lead to the collapse of the food security of hundreds of millions of people reliant on bushmeat for survival.</p> <p>The work comes against the backdrop of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jun/19/humans-creating-sixth-great-extinction-of-animal-species-say-scientists\">natural world undergoing the greatest mass extinction</a> since a giant meteorite strike wiped out the dinosaurs 65m years ago, with species vanishing far more rapidly than the long term rate, driven by the destruction and invasion of wild areas by humans and their livestock and hunting.</p> <p>The researchers, whose study is published in the <a href=\"http://rsos.royalsocietypublishing.org/lookup/doi/10.1098/rsos.160498\">journal Royal Society Open Science</a>, used the International Union for Conservation of Nature\u2019s (IUCN) <a href=\"http://www.iucnredlist.org/\">red list</a> to identify the endangered land mammals that are primarily at risk from hunting for food. They found 301 such species, representing 7% of all the land mammals assessed by IUCN and about a quarter of all endangered mammals. Other mammals are threatened by habitat loss or hunting for other reasons, such as elephants which are poached for their ivory.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"79779874daae9bb7ca4224c55a6a83a2d3ae57c8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/79779874daae9bb7ca4224c55a6a83a2d3ae57c8/0_0_5336_3552/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The mandrill is among the endangered land mammals primarily at risk from hunting for food.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The mandrill is among the endangered land mammals primarily at risk from hunting for food.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Maren Reichelt/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The 301 species include 168 primates, such as the lowland gorilla and mandrill, 73 hoofed animals, such as the wild yak and bactrian camel, 27 bats, such as the golden-capped fruit bat and the black-bearded flying fox, and 12 carnivores, such as the clouded leopard and several bear species. </p> <p>There are also 26 marsupials threatened by meat hunting, including the grizzled tree kangaroo, and 21 rodent species, such as the Sulawesi giant squirrel and the alpine woolly rat. All eight species of pangolins - scaly anteaters - are threatened and these species <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/28/pangolins-thrown-a-lifeline-at-global-wildlife-summit-with-total-trade-ban\">won top-level protection at the recent summit</a> of the Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species.</p> <p>\u201cThere are a plenty of bad things affecting wildlife around the world and habitat loss and degradation are clearly at the forefront, but among the other things is the seemingly colossal impact of bushmeat hunting,\u201d said Prof David Macdonald, at the University of Oxford and part of the international team that produced the research. \u201cYou might rejoice at having some habitat remaining, say a pristine forest, but if is hunted out to become an empty larder, it is a pyrrhic victory.\u201d</p> <p>He said: \u201cThe number of hunters involved has gone up, and the penetration of road networks into the remotest places is such that there is no refuge left. So it becomes commercially possible to make a trade out of something that was once just a rabbit for the pot. In places like Cameroon, where I have worked, you see flotillas of taxis early in the morning going out to very remote areas and being loaded up with the [bushmeat] catch and taken back to towns.\u201d</p> <p>The scale of the global bushmeat trade is difficult to measure but, in 2011, the Center for International Forestry Research estimated <a href=\"http://www.cifor.org/publications/pdf_files/articles/ANasi1101.pdf\">6m tonnes of animals were taken each year</a>. Another estimate indicates 89,000 tonnes of meat, worth $200m, is taken every year from the Brazilian Amazon. The meat is also smuggled abroad, with 260 tonnes of wild meat per year estimated to be hidden in personal baggage at just one European airport, Paris Charles de Gaulle.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"663d438ff179048926c85cf4ae1a5da94cba9659\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/663d438ff179048926c85cf4ae1a5da94cba9659/0_173_4800_2880/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A truck loaded with passengers stops outside a restaurant serving bush meat, in the town of Epulu, Democratic Republic of Congo.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A truck loaded with passengers stops outside a restaurant serving bush meat, in the town of Epulu, Democratic Republic of Congo.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rebecca Blackwell/APN</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Bushmeat is often caught using long lines of snares, which trap animals indiscriminately. Macdonald, who works with the lions in Hwange park in Zimbabwe where <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jun/28/cecil-the-lions-legacy-death-brings-new-hope-for-his-grandcubs\">Cecil the lion lived</a>, has seen lions killed by snares set for game species.</p> <p>The extinction of the threatened mammals would also irrevocably upset the balance of many ecosystems. For example, they include predators that keep rodents in check, species vital for dispersing seeds and others such as bats that pollinate flowers.</p> <p>\u201cWith this [hunting] trend, the loss of mammal populations thus affects the livelihoods and food security for hundreds of millions of rural people across the globe,\u201d the scientists warned.</p> <p>Macdonald said: \u201cYou have got to distinguish between those people who have no choice but to eat bushmeat, and what is to be done for them, and people now living in towns who have a nostalgic memory for the time when they lived on bushmeat, but no longer need to, so it is a luxury.\u201d</p> <p>The researchers said solving the problem of over-hunting will require greater legal protection for the species, empowering local communities to benefit from wildlife conservation, providing alternative foods and better education and family planning to curb population growth.</p>",

  "<p>On 17 March 2016, the watch manufacturer Breitling opened a lavish new stall at Baselworld, the world\u2019s biggest watch fair, to show off its latest marvels. There was the Avenger Hurricane, a beefy black and yellow extravaganza in a special polymer case<strong> </strong>made specifically to survive all extremes of superhuman adventure (\u00a36,500). There was the Superocean Chronograph M2000 Blacksteel, with full functionality at a depth of 2,000 metres (\u00a33,850). And there were at least 60 other items, each out-glistening the other in an attempt to demonstrate a new and expensive way to tell the time.</p> <p>And then there were the fish. Above the entrance to the temporary shop \u2013 which, at 10 metres high, was really more of a pavilion \u2013 was a huge tank holding 650 jellyfish. The tank \u2013 really more of an aquarium \u2013 was the size of a new London Routemaster bus sliced down the middle.<strong> </strong>Empty, it weighed 12 tonnes; its 16,113 litres of water added another 16.5 tonnes. Because it contained so many fish and so much water, the tank\u2019s sides were made from a 13cm-thick layer of methacrylate, a transparent material similar to plexiglass.</p> <p>Precisely what the jellyfish had to do with selling watches was a mystery, and it would remain a mystery until they were removed from the tank when the pavillion closed. Perhaps they represented freedom; perhaps they were a reminder of the sort of thing you could see if you purchased a Breitling diving chronometer. But the strangest thing about the tank was that most people who saw it just glanced up and swiftly moved on. Considering where it was, it didn\u2019t seem unusual at all.</p> <p>For eight days each year, <a href=\"http://www.baselworld.com/\">Basel becomes the centre of the watch universe</a>. The fair\u2019s organisers claimed 150,000 paying visitors and 1,800 brands spread over 141,000 square metres of exhibition space. Admission cost 60 Swiss francs a day (almost \u00a350), for which one could have bought a nice Timex. Near the Breitling pavilion was an obelisk for Omega, and a palace for Rolex. TAG Heuer adorned its booth with a TAG Heuer-sponsored Formula 1 racing car. One could spend many hours walking the plush carpets here, and encounter many very handsome men and women<strong> </strong>promoting Breguet, Hublot, and Longines, and very many handsome men and women buying their wares, too. Some booths were also selling jewellery \u2013 including Chanel, Gucci and Chopard \u2013 and some brands were selling watches covered in jewels:<strong> </strong>symphonies of the unnecessary, such as the Harry Winston Premier Moon Phase 36mm, with mother of pearl and 104 brilliant-cut diamonds.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2016/nov/21/still-ticking-the-improbable-survival-of-the-luxury-watch-business-podcast\">Still ticking: The improbable survival of the luxury watch business \u2013 podcast</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The show was a celebration of our mastery of timekeeping, and of the refinement and years of training that go into making objects of beauty and accuracy. But it was also a celebration of excess and superfluousness, of watches that exist merely because they can, like animal acts at a circus. Many worked on the most intricate levels to perform functions almost beyond usefulness: there were watches with a calendar that lasts 1,000 years; there were watches showing the phase of the moon in a different time zone. And then there were items such as the Aeternitas Mega 4 from Franck Muller, assembled from 1,483 components. This would announce the hours and quarter-hours with the same chime sequence as Big Ben. At its launch, it was heralded by its makers as the most complex wristwatch ever made, and a grandiose work of art.<strong> </strong>In addition to its 36 \u201ccomplications\u201d \u2013 a complication is essentially a nice gimmick \u2013 was the ability to tell the time. Another complication was that it cost \u00a32.2m.</p> <p>And therein lies the mystery of the modern timepiece. These days, no one requires a Swiss watch to tell the time \u2013 or a watch from any country. The time displayed on our mobile phones and other digital devices will always be more accurate than the time displayed on even the most skilfully engineered mechanical watch, yet the industry has a visual presence in our lives like few others. The storefronts of the world\u2019s big-money boulevards glow with the lustre of Rolex and Omega; newspapers and magazines appear to be kept in business largely by watch adverts; airports would be empty shells without them. The export value of the Swiss watch trade fell by 3.3% last year, due primarily to a downfall in demand from the east Asia. But it is up 62.9% compared with six years ago. In 2015 the world bought 28.1m Swiss watches valued at 21.5 billion Swiss francs.</p> <p>We live in uncertain economic times, but watch prices at Baselworld show no signs of making a cut-price concession to the unstable yen or rouble, or even the recent competition from the Apple Watch. Indeed, the opposite seems to be true: the higher the asking price, the greater the appeal, for cheapness may suggest a reduction in quality.</p> <p>So the Rolex Oyster Perpetual Day-Date 40 in platinum (\u201cThe watch par excellence of influential people\u201d) is on sale for \u00a341,700, while the platinum Patek Philippe Split-Seconds Chronograph with the alligator strap (\u201cFor men who take accuracy seriously\u201d) is \u00a3162,970. For some collectors, this would be considered entry-level: the most complicated limited-edition watches sell for \u00a31m or more. These watches have a waiting list, as the world only contains so many squinting master craftsmen who can make them, and even they haven\u2019t found a way to extend the day beyond 24 hours.</p> <p>But why do we continue to buy these over-engineered and redundant machines? Why do so many people pay so much for an item whose principal function may be bought for so little? And how does the watch industry not only survive in the digital age, but survive well enough to erect a 16,000-litre salt\u2011water shrine to its continued mastery of an outmoded art? Far beyond the telling of time, watches tell us something about ourselves. And so the answers to these questions lie within our propensity for extreme fantasy, our consumption of dazzling marketing, our unbridled and shameless capacity for ostentation, and our renewed reverence for craftsmanship in a digital world.</p> <p>And perhaps there is something else ticking away at us \u2013 a feeling that the acceleration of our daily lives may soon prove overwhelming. When watchmaking began, we had no concept of packed calendars and unbreakable deadlines, much less of \u201cquality time\u201d or \u201cme time\u201d. Our days were not ruled by the clock. These days, having brought this ungovernable storm of rush upon ourselves, we may be grateful for anything \u2013 not least a beautiful windable timepiece \u2013 that reinstates at least an illusion of control.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>The Patek Philippe showroom at 18 New Bond Street has been done up in a sophisticated palette of sycamore, brass and alabaster. Here we may find the revered Swiss company\u2019s entire current Patek collection, stretching from the relatively modest Calatrava and Aquanaut models (beginning at around \u00a35,000) to the ludicrous Grandmaster Chime Ref 6300 in white gold, fat as a fist, which costs in the region of \u00a31.7m.</p> <p>One enters the salon through a double-door airlock, ensuring that no one gets in who may not appreciate exquisite artistry, and no one leaves who has not settled their account. The showroom \u2013 at 400 square metres, the largest single-brand watch emporium in the UK \u2013 was not sufficiently large to host its own opening party in December 2014. The event was held in a glass pavilion in the courtyard of Somerset House, decorated for the night in a style that would not have looked out of place in the heyday of Versailles, albeit a Versailles lit by LED lights on fake cherry trees.</p> <p>The London salon is the most modern of Patek\u2019s three flagship stores, but they all share a similar retail psychology. The others, in Paris and at the company\u2019s home in Geneva, envelop the clientele in an identical citrus scent, and in all three, the piped music is as suave and alluring as 1950s Monaco. \u201cThere are a few subtle differences,\u201d the company\u2019s PR chief tells me. \u201cIn London you get biscuits with your coffee, whereas in Geneva you get chocolates.\u201d</p> <p>In all three stores an imminent purchase is made more pleasurable, and more likely, with the arrival of champagne. The London outlet has a lower-ground area resembling a library, and a twinkling, softly lit \u201ccelestial room\u201d where prospective buyers may examine watches with ultimate discretion. The entire showroom has purposely banished all facets of the digital world: there are no iPads or electronic tills, and the staff have undergone a course in calligraphy to enable the careful inking of customer receipts and guarantees.</p> <p>\u201cMy expertise is making people happy and to create an environment my customers enjoy,\u201d said Ed Butland, the store\u2019s director. \u201cWe will show you any item suited to your needs and circumstance. Money is the last thing we want to talk about.\u201d On the day I visited, Butland was not wearing his usual watch, a manually wound platinum Calatrava with a two-tone dial, but conducting a wear-test on a stainless-steel ultra-thin movement porthole Nautilus that had just been serviced.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It\u2019s nearly the only jewellery we can have as a man.  It\u2019s not only a watch, it\u2019s a piece of art</p> <footer> <cite>Ed Butland</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cAn iPhone has no soul,\u201d he said. \u201cWith most electronic devices there\u2019s just a screen and a back, and nothing that connects you with what\u2019s actually going on to make it work, and nothing\u2019s moving. There\u2019s no human element and no human emotional connection.\u201d This partly explains the longstanding appeal of a mechanical timepiece of any make.<strong> </strong>A few weeks before my tour of the showroom, I had visited Patek Philippe\u2019s headquarters in the Geneva suburb of Plan-les-Ouates, where I talked to Thierry Stern, the company\u2019s president. He had his own thoughts on why the watch endures.</p> <p>\u201cWe should never forget that it\u2019s nearly the only jewellery we can have as a man,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s something nice! We should never forget that. It\u2019s not only a watch, it\u2019s a piece of art. If they [our customers] want to keep it as something of value, fine. I would prefer to see them wearing it. It\u2019s also a reward I think. Yes, you could give a quartz or digital watch to your son for his wedding, but I do not think those types of items today will last. They will change every year, like phones, so should I engrave a [digital] watch like this and say \u2018Happy Birthday from your dad\u2019, and then what are you going to do the next year?\u201d</p> <p>Patek Philippe prides itself on being the last independently owned watchmaker in Geneva. The company has been in the hands of the Stern family since 1932. Thierry Stern, who is 46, took over from his father Philippe six years ago. He is gently unassuming and comfortably portly, and quite lacking in the hauteur one may expect from the head of such a distinctive brand.<strong> </strong>He speaks softly and laughs easily \u2013 one has no trouble picturing him selling ties, or with a pot of fondue in front of him. He recalled a meeting he had recently in New York with industry leaders from Silicon Valley, and he was surprised to see how many of them wore Patek. When he asked them why, he told me, \u201cThey all said the same: \u2018It brings us down to earth, and it\u2019s nice to have something mechanical when you\u2019ve been working in the digital world for so long.\u2019\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Jay Z has rapped about owning a Hublot and the 'big-face' Rolex ('I got two of those') he boasts in a duet with Kanye</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In the last six years Stern has increased annual production from about 40,000 watches to 60,000, which is still a minuscule output compared to a Swiss giant like Rolex, which produces more than 700,000 watches a year. Exclusivity is a key to desirability. Stern maintained that he was not worried by a difficult start to the year and the impact of Brexit on sales; he had just approved the designs for the collection for 2028. When you\u2019re dealing with time, he suggested, it helps to take the long view.</p> <p>Patek Philippe, which sold its first watch in the 1850s, has never been at the vulgar end of the market, and doesn\u2019t look for endorsements from star footballers and rappers the way other brands do. Jay Z, for example, who has rapped about owning a Hublot and the \u201cbig-face\u201d Rolex (\u201cI got two of those!\u201d he boasts in a duet with Kanye West on their album Watch the Throne) might not seem the most likely customer of the more subtle Patek brand. But he is: he has been spotted at basketball games wearing a \u00a3120,000 Grand Complications model in white gold. Perhaps he likes the elegance and (relative) restraint of it, a 21st-century billionaire hankering for an updated 19th-century masterpiece. Either way, he is certainly an avid consumer of the brand\u2019s brilliant marketing.</p> <p>Patek has run virtually the same advert for the last 20 years, and it contains a tagline that is both enduringly effective and highly annoying: \u201cYou never actually own a Patek Philippe. You merely look after it for the next generation.\u201d The line is accompanied by images of models in various stages of self-satisfaction: a father seated at a piano with his son, a mother laughing with her daughter over life\u2019s little luxuries. The photographs, taken by Herb Ritts, Ellen von Unwerth, Mary Ellen Mark and other artists whose work hangs in museums, are designed to stir a sense of responsibility and family obligation, of dynasty and heritage. They may appeal primarily to someone with new money aspiring to be someone with old money. Buy an expensive watch, they seem to be saying, and you will belong.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"050a3b07139501763de3db95af6ec2eb9951439a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/050a3b07139501763de3db95af6ec2eb9951439a/34_0_508_744/341.jpg\" alt=\"the Aeternitas Mega 4 from Franck Muller\" width=\"341\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Aeternitas Mega 4 from Franck Muller.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: www.thewatchquote.com/mesIMG/imgStd/28276</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Tim Delaney, the chairman of Leagas Delaney, the English advertising company responsible for the \u201cGenerations\u201d campaign, told me that the adverts arose out of a desire to reflect Patek Philippe\u2019s own sense of longevity and belonging \u2013 the fact that, unlike most watch brands, which are owned by large conglomerates, the company is independent.</p> <p>I asked him why his campaign had lasted so long. \u201cI think it\u2019s a universal insight,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s not pushy \u2013 the thought doesn\u2019t run down, it doesn\u2019t become less intelligent the more you see it.\u201d The photographs are an attempt \u201cto show humanity and warmth.

And yet none of these developments has threatened the dominance of the Swiss watchmaking industry. Exports soared even during the second world war \u2013 with the rest of Europe in turmoil, the temporal reliability of neutral Switzerland assumed even greater significance. For example, the International Watch Company \u2013 a leading manufacturer based on the banks of the Rhine, in the northern Swiss city of Schaffhausen \u2013 sold its Big Pilot\u2019s Watch to both the RAF and the Luftwaffe. Both sides were grateful for its massive dial, its huge glove-operable crown and its protection against sudden drops in air pressure as they tried to shoot each other out of the sky.</p> <p>In 2014, the Swiss exported 29m watches. This was only 1.7% of all watches bought globally, but 58% of their value. This raises a string of questions. Why Switzerland in the first place?<strong> </strong>How did this unassuming, landlocked country come to dominate the industry?<strong> </strong>And how did it master the art of charging tens of thousands for an object that often kept time less accurately than an object costing \u00a310?</p> <p>The first mechanical watches were not Swiss. The earliest \u2013 first round and then oval-shaped, and worn as large necklaces \u2013 appeared around 1510 in Germany, the Netherlands, France and Italy. A small trade developed in Geneva a few decades later, thanks largely to artisans employed as goldsmiths; filigree and enamel work, and experience with intricate engraving tools, enabled craftsmen to turn their attention to miniature mechanics. There were 176 goldsmiths working in Geneva in the 16th century, and their emergent watchmaking skills were almost certainly aided by the arrival of Huguenot refugees from France.</p> <p>None of this quite explains why it was Switzerland, rather than Germany or France, that gained the pre-eminent reputation for precision and beauty. But this is because that reputation emerged primarily in the 20th century. Prior to this, companies such as Breguet, Cartier and Lip in Paris, and many small firms<strong> </strong>based in Glassh\u00fctte, in the German state of Saxony, all produced prized specimens. (These regions still produce fine watches, they just struggle to compete with the cachet of being made in Switzerland.)</p> <p>In England, which could justifiably claim to be the innovative centre of clock and watchmaking in the 17th and 18th centuries, the roster of premier craftsmen included names still celebrated at the Greenwich Royal Observatory and the British Museum: Thomas Mudge, John Harrison and Thomas Tompion. With the exception of Harrison, whose clocks enabled the calculation of longitude at sea, the names are now all but forgotten, owing to the habitual British practice of neglecting the concerns in which it once led the world.</p> <p>But the Swiss just kept on going, occasionally buying up the most prominent firms elsewhere in Europe, and forming trade bodies and certification targets that increased the industry\u2019s reputation for quality and honesty. In the 19th century, the Swiss became masters of the increasingly flat mechanisms that enabled traditional pocket watches to evolve into wristwatches; a watch worn as a bracelet was particularly useful when riding on horseback.</p> <p>The Swiss also made full use of new innovations, enthusiastically replacing the old method of winding a watch by key in favour of the modern stem-and-crown mechanism. In the early 20th century, they combined the new American-originated system of conveyor-belt mechanisation with the finest methods of local hand-crafting.</p> <p>Today, the particular qualities that make a watch Swiss are the subject of strict legal definition, and are as closely regulated as champagne or parmesan cheese (the description on watches is always \u201cSwiss made\u201d or just \u201cSwiss\u201d rather than \u201cMade in Switzerland\u201d, a tradition dating back to 1890). To qualify, a watch must meet certain strict criteria (or, according to the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration de l\u2019Industrie Horlog\u00e8re Suisse FH, where this classification originates, a watch must adhere to \u201cThe new requirements stipulated by Swissness\u201d). To classify as Swiss Made, a watch must a) have a Swiss movement (that is, the basic mechanism consisting of cogs and springs that make the watch tick) b) have this movement incorporated in a case that is made within Switzerland and c) be checked and certified in Switzerland.</p> <p>All was going well until the 1970s, when something hit the hand-made mechanical watch trade like a mallet. As the decade progressed it seemed that the Swiss would not, after all, be telling the world\u2019s time for ever. In September 1975, The Horological Journal \u2013 a well regarded trade publication founded in 1858 \u2013 announced \u201ca milestone in the history of horology\u201d. On its cover was a picture of a Timex, a watch that ran on quartz. It contained a tiny piece of crystal that resonated at a high and fixed frequency when powered by a battery. This steady signal was then transmitted to an oscillator, an electronic circuit that regulated the gears that turned the watch hands. The old mechanism of winding and power storage in a coiled spring was dismissed at a stroke.</p> <p>The quartz movement had been around since the 1920s, but its miniaturisation had only been achieved in prototype by Seiko and Casio in Japan in the late 1960s. Its price had previously taken it beyond the general consumer, but now, through mass production at Timex and its main American rival Bulova, the electronic watch represented a change of philosophy \u2013 a piece of disruptive technology long before the phrase existed. It was solid state, with no ticking, and the new watch heralded the dawn of mass tech-based consumerism. Split-second timing, once the exclusive domain of physicists and technicians, was now available to all, and there was no better symbol of the seismic shift from the mechanical to the electronic world. Time itself was now flashing at us everywhere. No theatre visit was complete without half-hourly beeping from watches in the audience, alarms were now rushing us to every appointment.</p> <p>The Swiss reacted to the digital disruption with a combination of denial and mild panic. Between 1970 and 1983, the Swiss share of the watch market fell from 50% to 15%, and the industry shed more than half its workforce. As one of Tom Stoppard\u2019s characters put it in his 1982 play The Real Thing, \u201cIt looked all over for the 15-jewel movement. Men ran through the marketplace shouting \u2018the cog is dead!\u2019\u201d But the days of the Japanese digital watch were numbered. In the early 1980s, with doom on the horizon, the Swiss fought back with a new philosophy of their own, and something plastic, cheaper and powered by quartz and battery: the Swatch.</p> <p>The Swatch \u2013 from its name onwards \u2013 injected colour, youth and fun into Swiss watches (God knows, the fusty industry needed it). The watches were sold in the company\u2019s own shops and advertised on MTV, while artists and film directors, including Keith Haring and Akira Kurosawa, designed limited editions and made watches hip and desirable again for a new generation. With the panic over, the Swiss could once more concentrate on numbering their bank accounts. In 2014, gross sales of the Swatch watch amounted to more than 9bn Swiss francs. Today, the Swatch Group is the world\u2019s largest watchmaking company, consisting of brands \u2013 including Longines, Blancpain and Rado \u2013 that once would have shuddered at the thought of being owned by an empire with such garish foundations. Swatch even owns Breguet, the company that claims to have made the first wristwatch in 1810.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Earlier this year, in an interview with the New York Times, Brad Pitt recalled his time on the set of the second world war movie Fury. Pitt, who is a brand ambassador for TAG Heuer, remembered that Logan Lerman, the youngest actor in the cast, was given a watch to keep track of various activities during the film\u2019s rehearsals. \u201cOne day he came to me and said the watch has stopped, and I said, \u2018You\u2019ve just got to wind it.\u2019 He came back literally 15 minutes later and said, \u2018Wait, how do you wind it?\u2019\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>For those born into the digital age, making a watch start may seem as distant and implausible as crank-starting a car</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>For those born into the digital age, the prospect of making a watch start may seem as distant and implausible as crank-starting a car or changing the ribbon on a typewriter. But it is precisely this process \u2013 the end of a feat of infinitely intricate human engineering \u2013 that appeals to the watch connoisseur. It also explains why a fine watch costs so much.</p> <p>Making anything really small by hand tends to be extremely expensive. In the watch industry, the precision of the tiny parts is one reason for the great cost (even the tiniest screw costs eight Swiss francs, precisely because it is such a tiny screw). But the major contributory factors are human and old-fashioned \u2013 the wisdom, handed down through centuries, required to make something beautiful and functional from an otherwise inanimate assemblage of metal and stones. In each of the magnificent Grande Complication watches made by the International Watch Company (IWC) there are 659 parts \u2013 453 more than there are bones in the human body.</p> <p>But this is nothing compared with the Patek Philippe Grandmaster Chime, which holds 1,366 parts within a 16.1mm-thick case. This is the one with the \u00a31.7m price tag, and I handled one for a brief minute when I visited the Geneva headquarters (how time flies when you\u2019re enjoying something you know will soon be taken away from you). The watch did actually feel expensive. It had a dual-face, a power mechanism running at 25,200 semi-oscillations per hour, a perpetual calendar, a strikework isolator display, a moon phase, and a Grande and Petite Sonnerie (internal chimes and alarms with tiny hammers striking polished gongs when activated by a side lever to let the wearer know the time in the dark).</p> <p>It was as heavy as any wrist would bear, and was without question a masterpiece of horological art. But the thing I liked most about it was that after nine years on the drawing board, and as many at the manufacturer\u2019s workbench, you still had to wind the damn beautiful thing by hand.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It\u2019s the God complex, or the Frankenstein complex. You have the white overcoat, and you\u2019re creating life.\u201d</p> <footer> <cite>Watchmaker Christian Bresser</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The greatest wonder of all is that this watch has a mechanical movement, much of it adapted from pocket watches created in the 17th century. The precision tooling and some of the fitting may be done by machine now, but the design and final assembly \u2013 the tiny screws, springs, plates, wheels and jewels, the weights on the edge of the balance wheel, the ratchets that mediate the power supply, the interconnected barrels that create an energy reserve, and the pallet fork attached to the escapement wheel that causes the ticking sound \u2013 are done by brain and hand.</p> <p>A master watchmaker at IWC Schaffhausen named Christian Bresser once told me that making a watch made him feel omnipotent. \u201cIt\u2019s the worst thing to say, but it\u2019s the God complex, or the Frankenstein complex.

One then has to sell the thing. With so many watch companies producing only slight variations of the same product, how should the well-heeled buyer make a choice in this<strong> </strong>crowded market? Should we rely, as we increasingly do in our modern world, on guidance from celebrities?</p> <p>At Baselworld in 2015 I squeezed my way into a launch of a new watch at a pavilion designed for Hublot. A flashy newcomer on the scene, Hublot was set up by an Italian in 1980, based itself in Nyon, a town in south-western Switzerland, and was owned by the French luxury goods conglomerate LVMH. Hublot prides itself on its timekeeping for leading sporting events, and its recent brand ambassador was Jos\u00e9 Mourinho, manager of Manchester United and a keen watch collector.</p> <p>Brand ambassadors are a key element of watch salesmanship, and the fact that they do not usually wear a watch at all while achieving their greatest feats is not a major consideration. Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo have signed for Audemars Piguet and Jacob &amp; Co. Alongside Mourinho, Hublot also has Usain Bolt. Breitling has John Travolta and David Beckham, Montblanc Hugh Jackman, Rolex Roger Federer, IWC Ewan McGregor, and Longines Kate Winslet. Patek Philippe has shied away from celebrity endorsements, but it did once boast that its clients included Queen Victoria.<strong> </strong></p> <p>When Mourinho appeared at Baselworld in 2015 he was still manager of Chelsea. He was wearing a grey raincoat over grey cashmere, and he accepted his watch with light applause and a short speech about how he has been part of the \u201cHublot family\u201d for a long time as a fan, but now it had all been made official (ie he had received his bank transfer). His watch was called the King Power Special One, almost the size of a hockey puck, 18-carat \u201cking gold\u201d with blue carbon, a self-winding Unico manufacture Flyback Chronograph with 300 components, an immense 48mm case, all the mechanics exposed on the dial side, blue alligator strap, a skeleton dial, a power reserve of 72 hours, an edition of 100 and a price in the region of \u00a332,000. The promotional blurb claimed that the item was just like Mourinho himself: \u201cThe watch is provocative \u2026 the robust exterior hides the genius below.\u201d It was both stunning and hideous at the same time.</p> <p>But the most remarkable thing about the Hublot King Power was not that it looked like an armoured tank, but that it did not keep very accurate time. When the popular American magazine WatchTime conducted tests on an earlier model, it found it gained between 1.6 to 4.3 seconds a day. Extra time: yet another thing for Mourinho to dispute with the referee.</p> <p>But accurate timekeeping has long ago ceased to be the point. And this, with deep irony, is another reason why the global watch industry survives. Once you can afford to spend even entry-level prices for a Patek Philippe or a Hublot, your watch has begun to represent status and one-upmanship. A watch is a statement of achievement, and also of intent. (It is also one of the easiest ways to export money from one country to another.) Something glittery on your wrist says something about your earning power and your taste, much as an expensive car can do; it is not always an attractive trait. It\u2019s a delusion, of course, but the fatter and more complicated and expensive the watch, the more the wearer may assume control of the universe, the still centre of a spinning wheel.</p> <p>Baselworld 2017 has already announced itself as \u201ca fairground for the senses\u201d. Next March, the show will feature an expanding array of smart watches, items that suggest the leading brands are not prepared to suffer another debacle comparable to the quartz crisis. Many companies initially dismissed the potential impact of the Apple Watch and similar devices that act as a synced companion to the mobile phone, but they have been forced to reconsider; when Apple began offering a watch in a gold case for several thousand pounds more than the standard model, and Herm\u00e8s began making \u00a31,550 straps for it, the luxury market began to feel a little uneasy.</p> <p>So Breitling will be offering its Exospace B55, enabling its chronograph to engage with any smartphone. And TAG Heuer will have its Connected Smart Watch, promising audio streaming over WiFi and all manner of fitness tracking. It claims it marks \u201ca completely new era \u2026 the world\u2019s first wrist-worn computer\u201d.</p> <p>But the watch has always been a computer; the difference now is what it computes. A dial that once etched out our lives in hours and minutes, its accuracy dependent on our capacity to set it in motion and wind it, may now keep us connected with the rest of the earth, via GPS and overnight wireless charging. Yet the remarkable thing is not the emergence of texts and emails on the wrists \u2013 that was always going to come at some point \u2013 but how robust the traditional and mechanical wristwatch has proven itself alongside the new technologies. Alongside the absurd complications of the fattest new timepiece comes something we are evidently keen to hang on to \u2013 a belief that beauty and refinement are ends in themselves, and that the workbench of the skilled engineer is still revered more than the production line. A beautiful ticking timepiece gives us something back \u2013 transporting us, perhaps, to an imagined time when time was still our friend.</p> <p><a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/timekeepers-429760.html\">Timekeepers: How the World Became Obsessed With Time</a>, by Simon Garfield, is published by Canongate at \u00a316.99.

Nigel Farage\u2019s career tracked the rise and fall of the Notting Hill brand of liberal Conservatism that was espoused (but not always practised) by Cameron\u2019s ruling clique.</p> <p>It was Cameron who dismissed the Kipper tendency in his own ranks as \u201c<a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4875502.stm\">fruitcakes, loonies and closet racists</a>\u201d, who amplified public anxiety about immigration without identifying a solution, who acquiesced to demands for an EU referendum and then botched the campaign. He fed Ukip as much culture-war grievance as it could swallow, then unwittingly cooked up a Brexit pudding so rich that the party struggles to digest its own victory.</p> <p>Ukip is now in a \u201cdeath spiral\u201d, according to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/11/senior-ukip-figures-back-paul-nuttall-for-leadership-after-steven-woolfe-storm\">Stephen Woolfe</a>, the immigration spokesman who earlier this week resigned from his party. He may be right; he may have spoken prematurely. For a party in total disarray, Ukip\u2019s poll rating is holding up pretty well.</p> <p>But it does feel as if Farage\u2019s reactionary parade and Cameron\u2019s Tory \u201cmodernisation\u201d project were bound in political symbiosis, each defined by the opposing force. The decline of one diminishes the other.</p> <p>In that sense, Ukip\u2019s rolling leadership crisis is the extra-parliamentary twin to the malaise afflicting the rump of pro-European Tories inside the Commons. Cameron-era liberals and Faragist reactionaries are both stumbling around the same strange new landscape, their familiar landmarks cast into darkness by the sudden all-eclipsing rise of Theresa May: a prime minster committed to Brexit but maddeningly inscrutable when it comes to the terms.</p> <p>It cannot be said that the Conservative remainers are entirely vanquished, but they are disoriented and leaderless. So it is not surprising that they are finding a degree of fellowship with refugee MPs of a New Labour disposition who are benighted in a haze of their own. They were not strangers. Some hatchets were buried on the campaign trail in pursuit of a remain vote. But now there is an emerging sympathy in shared alienation, as each side sees its party captured by an agenda hatched on their respective fringes.</p> <p>The Commons tearooms have always hosted cross-party friendships, but they tend to stay hidden behind the wall of tribal antagonism that MPs display to the public. After Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s leadership election victory last year, Tory MPs encountered new candour in Labour counterparts feeling besieged by a radical left movement that targeted them as fifth columnists. Conversations that used to dwell on parliamentary gossip turned into something more like political trauma counselling.</p> <p>Then came the referendum, and the horror that some Tory liberals felt watching Eurosceptic colleagues cast off the robes of moderation and economic prudence to splash around in murky pools of xenophobic populism. The experience of fighting a campaign with most of Fleet Street lined up on the other side also gave pro-EU Conservatives a salutary taste of what it feels like to have reasonable arguments incinerated in flames of hysterical press partisanship (a familiar sensation on the left). A common purpose in rehabilitating evidence-based centrism was born.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There is a Commons majority for a softer style of Brexit, but any alliance to check the hardliners is in its infancy</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>That is how the government was forced last week to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/12/theresa-may-accepts-need-for-brexit-debate-in-parliament\">accept a Labour motion demanding that parliament debate the terms of exit from the EU</a>. There was no back-channel plot. Keir Starmer, shadow Brexit secretary, launched a tentative foray and found a platoon of eager Tories at his side. The Conservative whips defused the situation with a face-saving amendment asserting that the referendum mandate must be respected.</p> <p>The Tory rebellion was partly a spontaneous reaction against the mood at the party\u2019s conference the previous week, where \u201chard\u201d Brexiteers had set the tone. It felt, according to one former minister, \u201cas if the party was high on amphetamines\u201d in Birmingham, speeding towards disaster, and needed to come down to earth.</p> <p>That alarm blended with simmering resentment at the way allies of Cameron and George Osborne were culled and their legacy trashed in the first days of May\u2019s reign. Downing Street pulled its punches in the referendum campaign, vetoing personal attacks on Brexit-backing ministers in the hope of facilitating post-combat reconciliation. But the leavers observed no such Geneva conventions. Despite May\u2019s own notional remainer allegiance, the new era started with executions of the deposed king\u2019s officers. That massacre has not been forgotten.</p> <p>There is a Commons majority for a softer style of Brexit, but any alliance to check the hardliners is in its fragile infancy. The referendum result is an irrefutable rebuke to the remainers. They lost the vote. They lost the argument.</p> <p>The fact that Tory and Labour moderates have also lost influence in their parties gives cause for common despair. But there is no obvious mechanism for turning the sympathy they feel for each other into a political renaissance in the country. Throw in all the Lib Dems and you still have a coalition of losers. Nick Clegg and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/oct/10/ed-miliband-mps-parliamentary-vote-brexit-terms-video\">Ed Miliband</a> made impressive, forensically argued speeches in last week\u2019s debate.

What\u2019s the big deal about lever-action shotguns?</strong></h2> <p>There\u2019s a lot of attention on the Adler lever-action shotgun but the issue is far bigger than that. Gun control groups \u2013 as well as police and law enforcement agencies \u2013 have raised concerns about the categorisation of all lever-action shotguns as \u201ccategory A\u201d. This is the most common type of licence that Australian gun owners can obtain; there are more than 700,000 category A licence holders across the country.<br></p> <p>By way of contrast, pump-action shotguns are listed as \u201ccategory C\u201d firearms. It is more difficult for gun owners to obtain these types of firearms, and there are greater restrictions on their use. Some firearms in this category are entirely restricted outside of specific military purposes.</p> <p>Despite their relatively low categorisation, lever-action shotguns can still fire extremely rapidly, which has been a issue of concern. Here\u2019s one illustration from Arnold Schwarzenegger in Terminator 2. In this (over-the-top) footage, Schwarzenegger is firing a Marushin M1887 lever-action shotgun.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3I7DYEmULA\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/k3I7DYEmULA?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>The debate about categorisation is being canvassed in the upcoming national firearms review, which is due to be completed this year.</p> <h2><strong>2. What has triggered the row?</strong></h2> <p>The federal government issued an <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/aug/28/after-20-years-australias-gun-control-debate-is-igniting-once-again\">import ban on all lever-action shotguns</a> with a firing capacity of more than five rounds. The justice minister, Michael Keenan, announced the temporary ban in 2015. Keenan said it had been introduced because \u201cthe government was concerned that a significant number of high-capacity lever-action shotguns were shortly due to be imported into Australia\u201d. This was in part a reference to the new Adler A-110, a model with a higher capacity magazine.</p> <p>In August 2016 the government decided <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.ministerjustice.gov.au/Mediareleases/Pages/2016/ThirdQuarter/Lever-action-shotguns-import-ban.aspx\">to extend the ban</a>, pending the outcome of the national firearms review later in the year.</p> <h2><strong>3. Why were people unhappy with the ban?</strong></h2> <p>The decision annoyed a lot of people for a lot of different reasons. The gun lobby was furious that all types of lever-actions weapons were subject to an import ban. Gun-friendly politicians such as Lleyonhjelm and <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/oct/19/adler-shotgun-new-south-wales-deputy-premier-backs-lifting-ban-on-imports\">some Nationals party members</a> have opposed it.</p> <p>On the other side of the fence, gun control groups see the ban as largely ineffective. This is because the Adler and other lever-action shotguns can be easily extended to increase their magazine capacity. For instance, an Adler with a five-cartridge magazine can be extended to hold 10 cartridges \u201cwith a simply DIY kit\u201d, according to Gun Control Australia\u2019s Samantha Lee. And Adler seven-shot rifles can be modified down to five-shot magazines to meet the import criteria. Various online gun outlets in Australia offer <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://shop.iceng.com.au/collections/magazine-extension-kits\">cheap and easy extension kits</a> that would allow a person to legally import a firearm and then extend its magazine\u2019s capacity.</p> <h2><strong>4. Who has the power to restrict gun imports in Australia?</strong></h2> <p>The power rests with the immigration minister, Peter Dutton. To enforce the lever-action shotgun moratorium, he introduced a regulation amending the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/F2015L01233\">customs (prohibited imports) regulations 1956</a>. This added to the prohibition list \u201ca lever-action shotgun fitted with a firearm magazine having a capacity of more than five rounds\u201d. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/15/it-took-one-massacre-how-australia-made-gun-control-happen-after-port-arthur\">It took one massacre: how Australia embraced gun control after Port Arthur</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But how lever-action shotguns are categorised is a separate issue. National laws that restrict the use of firearms have been made in agreement with the states and territories. The categorisation of weapons can essentially be changed only when all the states and territories agree.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <h2><strong>5. Does the federal government have the power to weaken gun control laws?</strong></h2> <p>The government could easily lift the import ban on lever-action shotguns. The immigration minister could simply repeal the regulation.</p> <p>This wouldn\u2019t change the broader gun control framework in Australia. To change the categories of weapons, or make changes to laws surrounding the use of or tests for firearms, would require that the changes be made by the states and territories.</p>",

They are feasting on the bloodied remains of a mother and young son, butchered in their own homes. It is, apparently, an open-shut case of murder-suicide: Luke Hadler, driven mad by years of punishing drought, turned a gun on his loved ones first, then on himself.</p> <p>Kiewarra is suffering the worst conditions of a century, a tiny outpost shimmering under \u201cday after day of burning blue sky\u201d.

Both regions, for example, are among the safest in the world: indeed, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-31329220\">Australian murder rates are at record lows</a>. Yet their relative peace seems to make homicide and butchery \u2013 when committed to the page \u2013 all the more alarming.</p> <p>In Scandinavia the landscape goes a long way towards creating a sense of dread, as does a bloody past and history of dark folklore. \u201cPlace matters more than ever in a globalised world,\u201d noted a 2012 <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/node/21561109\">Economist piece titled Those Bloody Scandinavians</a>. \u201cNordic crime writers understand that the more interconnected the world is, the more people crave a sense of place \u2013 the more distinctive and unusual the better.\u201d</p> <p>A number of Australian crime and horror writers have embraced the singularity of the local landscape over the last decade. Garry Disher\u2019s Bitter Wash Road (2013) is set in the bare, brittle \u201chardscrabble country\u201d of South Australia\u2019s wheatbelt. Adrian Hyland\u2019s two crime novels Diamond Dove (2006) and Gunshot Road (2010) take place in rural towns where mangy dogs swarm. As seen by Hyland\u2019s Aboriginal protagonist \u2013 amateur detective Emily Tempest \u2013 the desert in central Australia is alive and animate; to the mining companies, however, it is a resource to be exploited. </p> <p>Charlotte Wood\u2019s feminist horror novel The Natural Way of Things, published last year and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/feb/08/charlotte-woods-novel-the-natural-way-of-things-optioned-for-a-film\">also optioned for a film</a>, sees 10 women drugged, abducted and held against their will in the outback. The remoteness of the bush drums home the savagery of their imprisonment, and their very survival depends on their embracement of that same harsh environment. </p> <p>In The Dry, Falk wanders down gloomy country roads. Nocturnal insects rattle \u201clike white noise\u201d. Birds shriek. The community is mired in poverty. And where the river should be carving its way through the fields, there is only \u201can eerie nothingness\u201d a \u201cdusty scar in the land\u201d.</p> <p>Disher, Harper, Hyland and Wood all tap into a long tradition: one in which landscape is both a trigger for psychological change, a marker for pathetic fallacy, and a mirror that draws on deep-seated fears and cultural clashes about what it means to be Australian.<br></p> <h2>Exploration and exploitation</h2> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/aug/25/dont-stop-there-its-a-hellhole-matthew-abbott-captures-the-murderous-majestic-australian-outback\">\u2018Don\u2019t stop there, it\u2019s a hellhole\u2019: Matthew Abbott captures the murderous, majestic Australian outback</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Early fiction in Australia saw the bush as land to be conquered. Late 19th century bush ballads \u2013 used as a tool to encourage exploration, exploitation and European settlement \u2013 lionised settlers able to tame the wild country. Like the cowboys of America\u2019s wild west, poems such as Banjo Paterson\u2019s The Man from Snowy River romanticised the brave and the brawny.</p> <p>Meanwhile, historical figures, most notably bushranger Ned Kelly, have gained legendary status for carving out a uniquely Australian identity, one enmeshed with the outback. Enduring hardship was celebrated. \u201cI am proud that I am Australian, a daughter of the Southern Cross, a child of the mighty bush,\u201d says Sybylla in (Stella) Miles Franklin\u2019s 1901 novel My Brilliant Career. \u201cA part of the bone and muscle of my nation.\u201d</p> <p>But if Australia views itself as a bush nation, today it is squarely suburban: nearly 90% of the population live in urban areas hugging the coast. That goes some way to explaining why portrayals of the bush have shifted from a terrain to be vanquished and conquered, to an entity that is \u201cother\u201d, far away and frightening.</p> <p>Early writers such as Henry Lawson recognised Australia as ripe for suspense: with the \u201ceverlasting, maddening sameness of the stunted trees\u201d, the suffocating loneliness and the danger of wild beasts all portrayed in his short story The Drover\u2019s Wife, there was no need to resort to the supernatural.</p> <p>True-life tales have bolstered rural Australia\u2019s reputation as a menacing place, including the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/08/we-know-who-did-this-how-solving-peter-falconios-changed-a-detectives-life\">disappearance of Peter Falconio in 2001</a>; the murders pinned on former abattoir worker <a href=\"http://www.news.com.au/national/the-remote-australian-highways-where-murderers-have-hunted-their-victims/news-story/817aeb3e7ae69a374cf9c4a645e6a665\">Andy Albury on the \u201chighway of death</a>\u201d; and the fates of the Page family of five who <a href=\"http://www.simpsondesert.fl.net.au/perisha/\">perished from thirst</a> in 1963 on the Birdsville Track, their corpses discovered days later near Deadmans Sandhill.</p> <p>Literature and movies in the latter half of the 20th century revelled in the bush as a setting for horror, playing on gender roles for maximum impact. The 1970s saw the creation of two masterpieces of cinema: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/australia-culture-blog/2014/feb/14/wake-in-fright-rewatching-australian-films\">Wake in Fright</a>, directed by Ted Kotcheff and based on the 1961 novel of the same name by Kenneth Cook; and Peter Weir\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/australia-culture-blog/2014/jan/23/picnic-hanging-rock-rewatching-australian-films\">Picnic at Hanging Rock</a>, modelled on the 1967 book by Joan Lindsay. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/australia-culture-blog/2014/feb/14/wake-in-fright-rewatching-australian-films\">Wake in Fright: rewatching classic Australian films</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The former played on the isolation, pent-up violence and rampant masculinity of white outback Australia. In the latter, by contrast, schoolgirls vanish on an outing to the bush. It is noted that Hanging Rock has stood there for \u201ca million years\u201d, an ancient part of the landscape that the British could never dominate, no matter how hard they try. The girls\u2019 disappearance shatters a carefully cultivated Victorian veneer, revealing repressed sexuality and simmering madness. The landscape, quite literally, consumes them.</p> <p>Bushfires, too, are fodder to show both a combustible society \u2013 with its raw tensions between Indigenous people and settlers, between \u201crespectable\u201d femaleness and the virile, ready thump of rugged manliness \u2013 and an explosive topography. The Dry uses fire \u2013 which \u201csurged and jumped and gorged itself \u2026 like an animal\u201d \u2013 to nail-biting effect, a weapon far more deadly and devastating than any knife or gun.</p> <p>Above all else, Australian horror and crime excels in showing what can go wrong on long, lonely roads, as portrayed in the 2005 surprise-hit film <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/australia-culture-blog/2014/feb/18/wolf-creek-classic-australian-films\">Wolf Creek</a>. In The Dry the most frightening part of the outback is the \u201ccrushing vastness of the open land.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe space was the thing that hit them first. There was so much of it. There was enough to drown in,\u201d writes Harper, adding: \u201cTo look out and see not another soul between you and the horizon could be a strange and disturbing sight.\u201d</p>",

Perhaps he had been stringing Leyonhjelm along, hoping to keep the senator in the tent as a likely \u201cyes\u201d on the ABCC legislation until the government had swung the three NXT senators and the four One Nation senators to its side. With seven votes plus the likely support of the new Family First senator, maybe Turnbull thought Leyonhjelm would get drop his gun demands and get with the momentum rather than stand in its way.</p> <p>Turnbull has form with this style of negotiation.
