  "<p>Hillary Clinton\u2019s immediate FBI woes ended on Sunday with a letter whose five sentences signaled that James Comey\u2019s troubles have only begun.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/06/fbi-director-hillary-clinton-email-investigation-criminal-james-comey\">FBI director: new Hillary Clinton emails show no criminal wrongdoing</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The director of the FBI has come under withering, escalating and relentless criticism since he sent Congress a vague letter, on 28 October, heralding a potential re-examination of the investigation into Clinton\u2019s private email server. The original inquiry ended in July, after months of officials scouring Clinton\u2019s communications while secretary of state, with the conclusion that her practices were \u201cextremely careless\u201d but not criminal.</p> <p>On Sunday, Comey brought what many viewed as a frightening FBI intervention into a presidential election <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/06/fbi-director-hillary-clinton-email-investigation-criminal-james-comey\">to a close</a>. The Democratic presidential nominee will not face an FBI recommendation for indictment over her stewardship of classified information.</p> <p>Whether or not Comey endangered his position at the head of the FBI, the episode has cost him his chief asset: his reputation, cultivated assiduously in the media, for probity and judgment. Beyond the director himself, the coda to the Clinton email inquiry has exposed the FBI as a politicized agency, a development with serious repercussions over the next several years. </p> <p>Donald Trump spent much of the summer and fall attacking the FBI as \u201ccorrupt\u201d for failing to recommend indictment, only to reverse himself entirely after Comey\u2019s October letter. Now that Comey has ended the issue ahead of the election, the director has demonstrated himself to be an unreliable ally to Trump, who has <a href=\"http://bigstory.ap.org/article/fe4c21e8e44146b2abcaba857563d11f/trump-touts-his-loyalty-defending-campaign-manager\">loudly insisted</a> on complete loyalty around him. Should Trump win the election, Comey is likely to find himself either marginalized or unemployed. </p> <p>If Clinton wins, Comey\u2019s position is unlikely to be much better. </p> <p>Sources within the FBI have pointed to a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/03/fbi-leaks-hillary-clinton-james-comey-donald-trump\">deep, visceral antipathy to Clinton</a> within the bureau, as well as substantial support for Trump. Comey\u2019s earlier decision to publicly recommend no charges had spurred anger among FBI employees disposed negatively toward her, and Comey\u2019s newest letter changes none of that sentiment. Now Comey has restored that status quo ante, again frustrating anti-Clinton sentiments in his workforce. This time, however, he has seen his allies in Washington <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/30/democratic-senators-fbi-director-comey-clinton-emails-letter\">abandon him</a>, depriving Comey of a bulwark against his rank-and-file.</p> <p>The loss of that bulwark is critical, and will likely become visible in the near future. Beyond the email inquiry, the FBI also has had the Clinton Foundation, the family\u2019s charity, under some form of scrutiny.</p> <p>Once again, Comey is in a bind. FBI sources have already leaked that allegations against the foundation are <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trumps-claims-evidence-fbis-clinton-foundation-probe-impressive/story?id=43282736\">weak</a>, given their source in a book by a far-right author who provides little evidence. Should the FBI fail to recommend another indictment, Trump\u2019s voters and congressional Republicans will presume bias in the bureau \u2013 particularly since those Republicans have already stated intentions to keep a hypothetical Clinton White House <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/house-republicans-are-already-preparing-for-years-of-investigations-of-clinton/2016/10/26/e153a714-9ac3-11e6-9980-50913d68eacb_story.html\">under persistent investigation</a>. Should the FBI recommend indictment, Clinton\u2019s voters and congressional Democrats will presume Comey acted for political reasons, or caved to such motives within the bureau. </p> <p>Comey may very soon himself be under investigation. Al Franken, a Minnesota senator on the judiciary committee with direct oversight of the FBI, said early Sunday he was \u201c<a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/06/politics/al-franken-fbi-james-comey-hearings/index.html\">certain</a>\u201d of forthcoming hearings into Comey\u2019s actions. After the latest letter, Senator Dianne Feinstein, another judiciary committee Democrat and a consistent ally of the security agencies, said she found Comey\u2019s intervention \u201ceven more troubling\u201d. Feinstein also called for a justice department review.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/nov/06/donald-trump-fbi-hillary-clinton-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/5aqff\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2873409\"            data-video-name=\"Donald Trump on Hillary Clinton and the FBI: \u2018She\u2019s protected\u2019 \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"AP/Reuters\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-581fb62be4b0d073c27d214c\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/11/06/161106TrumpOnFBI_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/11/06/161106TrumpOnFBI.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/11/06/161106TrumpOnFBI_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/nov/06/donald-trump-fbi-hillary-clinton-video\">Donald Trump on Hillary Clinton and the FBI: \u2018She\u2019s protected\u2019</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Clinton herself has pointedly declined to say whether she would retain Comey if she is elected. She too faces a political dilemma, even in the event of victory on Tuesday, since firing Comey could turn the director into a martyr for opponents on the right. Clinton\u2019s chief aides are notorious for their long memories, however, and her White House would likely view the FBI as a threat, or at least with extreme distrust. Her appointment of an attorney general would consequently fall under intense questioning about any tacit mandate to contain the bureau. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/30/james-comey-fbi-director-hillary-clinton-email\">James Comey: Hillary Clinton email inquiry is FBI chief's latest controversy</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Comey\u2019s political imbroglio coincides with his attempt to persuade Congress that sophisticated commercial encryption poses a security threat. He has now lost his chief weapon in that debate, the benefit of the doubt: FBI intervention into a presidential election has made fears of an assertive law enforcement and intelligence agency deciding the national agenda more salient than any PR campaign from privacy advocates ever could. </p> <p>It is a spectacular fall for Comey. He built his public persona as the man who stood up to pressure from George W Bush\u2019s White House over mass surveillance. The real story, hidden from public view until Edward Snowden\u2019s leaks, showed Comey to be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/27/james-comey-justice-department-data-monitoring\">significantly less heroic</a>, but the persona was enough to persuade Barack Obama to elevate him to run the FBI weeks after the Guardian began publishing material Snowden disclosed. After Comey <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/feb/17/inside-the-fbis-encryption-battle-with-apple\">picked a fight with Apple</a> over encryption and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/mar/28/apple-fbi-case-dropped-san-bernardino-iphone\">lost</a>, his judgment appeared shaky.</p> <p>Now Comey has committed an unforced error that has drained his reservoir of goodwill in Washington. With the FBI\u2019s integrity in the balance, Comey faces several difficult months, if not years, in Washington, regardless of the country\u2019s vote in two days.</p>",
  "<p>There were times during Sunderland\u2019s chastening winless run that David Moyes said he had forgotten how to smile. It was hard to begrudge the Scot a rare opportunity to grin after his team defiantly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/nov/05/bournemouth-sunderland-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">came from behind to beat Bournemouth</a>, but he was straight-faced again when explaining the importance of giving something back \u2013&#xa0;both to the players from whom his coaching staff have demanded so much, and the unwavering supporters that made a 700-mile round trip with everlasting hope but precious little expectation.</p> <p>On another day Sunderland could have been thrashed but, despite facing a better team, they dug in and continued to fight even when reduced to 10 men with an hour played. Their perseverance paid off handsomely. \u201cOne win doesn\u2019t keep you in the Premier League and if we don\u2019t get to two we won\u2019t be moving up any further,\u201d Moyes said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/nov/05/bournemouth-sunderland-premier-league-match-report\">Jermain Defoe spot-on at Bournemouth to give Sunderland first win</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The team\u2019s visit to the local Nissan factory last week was a reality check for some players and a motivating factor for all before this victory, and Moyes was at pains to point out he was particularly taken aback by a chat with one worker who was travelling from Wearside to the south coast to watch a defective team.</p> <p>\u201cA boy told me he was leaving for here at 5am on a bus,\u201d Moyes said. \u201cBut if you\u2019re following the team at the minute we\u2019re not giving you anything to shout about. Sunderland supporters deserve a bit of credit.\u201d</p> <p>Still, this is no time to sit back and take stock. They host Hull City immediately after the international break and a victory then could lift them off the bottom. One of Moyes\u2019s biggest calls before that will be whether he sticks with two strikers having switched to 4-4-2 at Bournemouth, giving Victor Anichebe a first start as a supplement for Jermain Defoe.</p> <p>Sticking with his winning formula would help Defoe, who has scored 21 in his past 39 games \u2013 an impressive feat considering he has ploughed such a lone furrow. History indicates he thrives off having a burlier partner and, considering the paucity of decent service he has endured for some time, Moyes is tempted to continue with it.</p> <p>Just do not expect it to last against the big teams. Moyes admitted his team were \u201coverrun\u201d in midfield for much of Saturday but he had to change something because his only experienced central player was Steven Pienaar, who ended up getting sent off.</p> <p>\u201cIf you look through most of Jermain\u2019s career, I think he\u2019s played with someone alongside him but in our team it\u2019s very difficult to have only four midfield players,\u201d Moyes added. \u201cWe don\u2019t have much possession and that means your defenders are often under the cosh but we had to try something because of what we had with injuries. We had very little choice.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/nov/04/sunderland-turmoil-helping-me-david-moyes\">Sunderland\u2019s recent turmoil is helping me keep job, says David Moyes</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Anichebe scored the equaliser and won the penalty for Defoe\u2019s winner having broken a rib in the opening minutes. It was quite a turnaround for a striker who has only 36 goals in 235 games and appeared at a loose end at West Bromwich Albion last season. \u201cHe has great strength and ability, I just hope he keeps showing it,\u201d added Moyes, who managed the Nigerian at Everton. \u201cVic was out there and there weren\u2019t many takers for him in the summer but I\u2019ve always had belief in Victor. He\u2019s got more than he shows sometimes and people don\u2019t recognise that he\u2019s a very good player.\u201d</p> <p>The ceaseless running of Duncan Watmore is another positive but Moyes is urging the 22-year-old to curb his enthusiasm. \u201cHe\u2019s got something but needs to learn when to slow down and speed up. Technically, his development will improve.\u201d</p> <p>So too, you expect, will Sunderland\u2019s results if they continue to battle as they did on Saturday.</p>",

That\u2019s not all \u2013 after just one defeat in 10, Jorge Sampaoli\u2019s team are very much in the early title race. Win tonight and they will go above Barcelona, and into second place.</p> <p>Let\u2019s not get ahead of ourselves; Sevilla are already over-achieving this season after the departures of their manager, midfield linchpin and their leading goalscorer in the summer.

Like all judges, he has sworn an oath to administer the law without fear or favour, affection or ill will,\u201d Truss said.</p> <p>Separately, Theresa May, speaking to reporters on her way to Delhi for a trade mission on Sunday, defended the right of the judges to issue their ruling, but would not condemn the media backlash over the issue.</p> <p></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/06/engineering-early-election-tempting-for-theresa-may\">Engineering an early election looks more tempting for Mrs May | Andrew Rawnsley</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Asked about the controversial reaction to the ruling in which the judges were branded as the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/nov/04/enemies-of-the-people-british-newspapers-react-judges-brexit-ruling\">enemies of the people</a>\u201d in coverage from pro-Brexit newspapers, the prime minister said: \u201cI believe in and value the independence of our judiciary, I also value the freedom of our press.

Those newspaper headlines are reflecting that.\u201d</p> <p>Asked on the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr Show on Sunday whether he thought that could mean \u201cdisturbances\u201d on the streets if parliament seeks to water down the result of the referendum, he said: \u201cI think that\u2019s right,\u201d adding: \u201cthe temperature of this is very, very high.\u201d He appeared on the programme alongside Gina Miller, the businesswoman who led the high court challenge.<br></p> <p>Meanwhile Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn made clear that his party would not vote against a bill implementing article 50, after his insistence that he would welcome an early general election was interpreted as a threat to try to force the government to accept his red lines on Brexit, including safeguards for workers\u2019 rights.</p> <p>Instead, Corbyn said he would press for \u201ctransparency and accountability\u201d about the government\u2019s aims in the two-year negotiation process. However, senior Liberal Democrats, including Nick Clegg, have suggested they could try to use the parliamentary process to block Brexit altogether.</p> <p>May condemned that idea, saying: \u201cThe people spoke on 23 June,\u201d insisting there would be no compromise on her position that free movement was a red line in any post-Brexit deal.</p> <p>\u201cThe people spoke on the 23 June and an important aspect that underpinned people\u2019s approach to that was a concern about control of movement of people from the EU into the UK. I believe it is important for the UK government to deliver on that.\u201d</p> <p>Brexit secretary David Davis is expected to use a statement to the House of Commons on Monday to reiterate the government\u2019s determination to appeal to the supreme court, and stick to its timetable of triggering article 50 by the end of March.</p> <p>The prime minister highlighted the fact that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/oct/28/belfast-court-rejects-legal-challenges-brexit\">a similar legal case in Belfast</a> had resulted in an opposite ruling. \u201cIn terms of the legal situation we\u2019ve had two court cases in the UK, they\u2019ve come out with different decisions. The Northern Irish court found in favour of the government, the high court found against the government. </p> <p>\u201cWe think we have strong legal arguments and will be taking those arguments to the supreme court,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat\u2019s important for MPs and peers is to recognise that parliament voted to give the decision on our membership of the European Union to the people on 23 June.

  "<p><strong> <br></strong></p> <p>Jack Wilshere has been rewarded for his first run of 90-minute matches for more than two years with an England recall after Dele Alli was forced out of Gareth Southgate\u2019s plans for the next two games with a knee injury. Wilshere has been named in a 25-man party for the World Cup qualifier against Scotland on Friday and the friendly against Spain the following Tuesday, after finally starting to show he is capable of playing regularly in the top division since joining Bournemouth on loan from Arsenal.</p> <p>Harry Kane is also recalled after his return to the Tottenham Hotspur side, while Adam Lallana, Danny Drinkwater, Nathaniel Clyne and Raheem Sterling have been brought back after missing Southgate\u2019s first two games as caretaker manager. Southgate has resisted any temptation to give Ross Barkley another chance while Michail Antonio\u2019s hopes of winning his first England cap have clearly diminished. The West Ham man has been unable to keep his place while Alex Oxlade\u2011Chamberlain also misses out as Southgate prepares for the pair of games that will almost certainly determine whether he is offered the chance to replace Sam Allardyce on a full-time basis.</p> <p>Wilshere was excluded for Allardyce\u2019s solitary game in charge against Slovakia and was also left out when Southgate took control for the qualifiers against Malta <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/11/slovenia-england-world-cup-qualifying-match-report\">and Slovenia</a>, but since then the midfielder has shown a clear improvement in his fitness.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2016/nov/07/gareth-southgate-on-poppy-armbands-in-england-scotland-world-cup-qualifier-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/5bvnd\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2874352\"            data-video-name=\"Gareth Southgate on poppy armbands in England-Scotland World Cup qualifier \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"SNTV\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-5820a140e4b07ceadb3a33d8\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/11/07/161107SouthgatePress_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/11/07/161107SouthgatePress.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/11/07/161107SouthgatePress_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2016/nov/07/gareth-southgate-on-poppy-armbands-in-england-scotland-world-cup-qualifier-video\">Gareth Southgate on poppy armbands in England-Scotland World Cup qualifier</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>His appearance against Tottenham last month was the first time he had completed 90 minutes of Premier League football for 771 days, stretching back to Arsenal\u2019s game against Manchester City in September 2014. Having subsequently done the same for Bournemouth in their following two matches, Wilshere can reflect that his move to the south coast is starting to pay off in terms of his fitness and international prospects.</p> <p>Southgate said: \u201cJack Wilshere is a player who we feel has a lot of class, it\u2019s good for him to get some 90 minutes under his belt again and we felt the time was right to put him back in.\u201d</p> <p>Southgate will explain more of his reasoning at a 10am press conference at St George\u2019s Park on Monday, when he is also likely to face questions about the absence of Chris Smalling and Luke Shaw from his list of defenders. Both players pulled out of Manchester United\u2019s squad for the 3-1 win against Swansea City, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/nov/06/jose-mourinho-manchester-united-players-mentalities\">apparently upsetting Jos\u00e9 Mourinho in the process</a>, and their injuries have now been deemed serious enough for them to miss out with the national team.</p> <p>That means Burnley\u2019s Michael Keane keeps his place in the squad while Southgate must have concerns that Kyle Walker might also miss out because of the injury that forced him off during the second half of Tottenham\u2019s 1-1 draw at Arsenal. Walker has been named in the squad and will report to Burton to be examined by England\u2019s medical staff, whereas the FA have adhered to the request of Mauricio Pochettino, the Spurs manager, that it is \u201ccommon sense\u201d not to include Alli after he twisted his knee in training on Saturday.</p> <h2>England squad to face Scotland and Spain</h2> <p><strong>Goalkeepers</strong> Forster (Southampton), Hart (Torino), Heaton (Burnley); <strong>Defenders</strong> Bertrand (Southampton), Cahill (Chelsea), Clyne (Liverpool), Jagielka (Everton), Keane (Burnley), Rose (Tottenham), Stones (Man City), Walker (Tottenham); <strong>Midfielders</strong> Dier (Tottenham), Drinkwater (Leicester), Henderson (Liverpool), Wilshere (Bournemouth), Lallana (Liverpool), Lingard (Man Utd), Rooney (Man Utd), Sterling (Man City), Townsend (Crystal Palace); <strong>Forwards</strong> Walcott (Arsenal), Kane (Tottenham), Rashford (Man Utd), Sturridge (Liverpool), Vardy (Leicester).</p>",

He makes you clap a LOT, my hands were red raw by bedtime. </li> <li>One of my favourite things to see is the off-camera relationship between Tess and Claudia.

  "<p>When I was a girl of 11 I had an argument with my father that left my psyche maimed. It was about whether a woman could be the president of the US.</p> <p>How did it even start? I was no <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/feminism\">feminist</a> prodigy, just a shy kid who preferred reading to talking; politics weren\u2019t my destiny. Probably, I was trying to work out what was possible for my category of person \u2013 legally, logistically \u2013 as one might ask which kinds of terrain are navigable for a newly purchased bicycle. Up until then, gender hadn\u2019t darkened my mental doorway as I followed my older brother into our daily adventures wearing hand-me-down jeans.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/06/fbi-director-hillary-clinton-email-investigation-criminal-james-comey\">James Comey: FBI has found no criminal wrongdoing in new Clinton emails</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But in adolescence it dawned on me I\u2019d be spending my future as a woman, and when I looked around, alarm bells rang. My mother was a capable, intelligent, deeply unhappy woman who aspired to fulfilment as a housewife but clearly disliked the job. I saw most of my friends\u2019 mothers packed into that same dreary boat. My father was a country physician, admired and rewarded for work he loved. In my primordial search for a life coach, he was the natural choice.</p> <p>I probably started by asking him if girls could go to college, have jobs, be doctors, tentatively working my way up the ladder. His answers grew more equivocal until finally we faced off, Dad saying, \u201cNo\u201d and me saying, \u201cBut why not?\u201d A female president would be dangerous. His reasons vaguely referenced menstruation and emotional instability, innate female attraction to maternity and aversion to power, and a general implied ickyness that was beneath polite conversation.</p> <p>I ended that evening curled in bed with my fingernails digging into my palms and a silent howl tearing through me that lasted hours and left me numb. The next day I saw life at a remove, as if my skull had been jarred. What changed for me was not a dashing of specific hopes, but an understanding of what my father \u2013 the person whose respect I craved \u2013 really saw when he looked at me. I was tainted. I would grow up to be a lesser person, confined to an obliquely shameful life.</p> <p>But I didn\u2019t stop asking what a woman gets to do, and so began a lifelong confrontation with that internal howl. The slap-downs were often unexpected. Play drums in the band? No. Sign up for the science team? Go camping with the guys? Go jogging in shorts and a tank top without fear of being assaulted? Experiment boldly, have a career, command a moral authority of my own? Walk home safely after dark? No, no, no.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/nov/06/why-do-we-love-a-trainwreck\">Why do successful women like Hillary Clinton get under so many people's skin?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Eventually, I wrestled my way to yes on most of these things, except of course the last one. And the same dread that stalks me in dark parking lots \u2013 the helpless fury of knowing I don\u2019t get to be just a person here, going about my business \u2013 has haunted all the other pursuits, from science team to career. It\u2019s a matter of getting up each day and pushing myself again into a place some people think I have no right to occupy.</p> <p>My father is very old now. Lately, I brought up our ancient argument about who may occupy the White House, but he didn\u2019t remember it.

It\u2019s even harder to imagine Clinton indulging in the boorish self-aggrandisement, intellectual laziness, racism and vulgar contempt for the opposite gender that characterise her opponent.

And the inclusion of non-state actors must go through a revision of conflict of interest. This is a standard request, a legal request and a moral request.

We are astonished that this issue was completely overturned in the conclusions.</p> </blockquote> <p>But the EU, Australia and the US rose to speak against any exclusion of fossil fuel lobbyists.</p> <p>The Australian delegation framed the issue as one where developing countries were trying to make the process less \u201copen\u201d, despite supporting measures in the tobacco control treaty to lock out the tobacco industry:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Parties are merely the custodians of this issue. Australia cannot and will not support an approach under the UNFCCC that will lead to us trying to block people from having access to what we do here. We operate under the basis \u2026 of openness and inclusiveness and transparency.</p> </blockquote> <p>Australia also argued the concept of \u201cconflict of interest\u201d itself was too hard to define, despite the issue being grappled with in many other forums:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There is no clear understanding of what a conflict of interest is and it means different things to different people.</p> </blockquote> <p>The US delegation also framed the issue as one where they were trying to be as inclusive as possible. \u201cWe oppose constraining NGO participation in the UNFCCC process,\u201d the US delegation said.</p> <p>Besides having access to meetings as observers, with no conflict of interest screening, the unprecedented level of corporate influence on the implementation of the Paris agreement <a href=\"http://newsroom.unfccc.int/media/408541/businessengagement_cop21_20150915_vf.pdf\">was formalised</a> in the global climate action agenda, through which corporations who make carbon-cutting pledges get high-level access to the meetings, can organise side events in the \u201ccivil society village\u201d, promote their products in a \u201cgallery\u201d and sponsor the conference.</p> <p>Kingsley Faulkner is the deputy president of the Australian Council of Smoking and Health as well as the national chair of Doctors for the Environment Australia.</p> <p>Faulkner says the exclusion of the smoking lobby from tobacco control forums was essential and that there are clear parallels to the fossil fuel lobby.</p> <p>\u201cBodies that make these decisions should be looking very seriously at who they allow into the policy-making groups and see in whose interests they are talking,\u201d Faulkner says. \u201cAnd if you do that, of course, you clamp down on the fossil fuel lobby.</p> <p>\u201cThere are a number of real examples where industries have huge influence on public policy, to the detriment of the health of the community.</p> <p>\u201cIf politicians are serious about saying their first priority is the security and the wellbeing of the community then they\u2019re going about it in a bad way if they allow the fossil fuel lobby to put that at risk.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>It is becoming harder to turn a blind eye to the suffering in Yemen, though plenty of people in London and Washington are trying. In the last month alone, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/08/saudi-led-coalition-airstrike-hit-yemen-funeral-officials-say\" title=\"\">bombing of a funeral</a>, killing at least 140 people, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/30/yemen-death-toll-from-saudi-led-airstrike-on-prisons-rises-to-58\" title=\"\">strike on a prison</a>, taking 58 more lives, and photographs of skeletal teenagers have all testified to the devastating impact of an overlooked war. Since it broke out in March last year at least 10,000 have died, including 4,000 civilians. The impoverished country struggled even in peacetime. Now more than 3 million have been displaced; <a href=\"http://www.wfp.org/news/news-release/wfp-alarmed-growing-rates-hunger-and-malnutrition-war-torn-yemen\" title=\"\">14 million are going hungry</a>. Four out of five Yemenis need aid.</p> <p>The Houthi rebels bear a good deal of blame for the devastation. They drove out the internationally recognised president Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi, allying with his predecessor, Ali Abdullah Saleh, who had been ousted in the Arab spring. But heavy bombing by the Saudi Arabian-led coalition has claimed an inordinate number of civilian lives \u2013 including in the funeral and prison attacks \u2013 and it is done with arms <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/03/us-military-members-war-crimes-yemen\" title=\"\">and military support</a> from the US, the UK and others.</p> <p>Some argue that this western involvement is <a href=\"http://labourlist.org/2016/10/john-woodcock-the-crisis-in-yemen-must-not-be-ignored/\" title=\"\">moderating Saudi behaviour</a>. That argument, never convincing, looks thinner by the day. The former business secretary Vince Cable has now <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/04/mod-seriously-misled-me-on-saudi-arms-sales-says-vince-cable\" title=\"\">told the Guardian</a> that he was misled when he signed export licences for British-made missiles on the proviso that the UK would have oversight of potential targets, since the Ministry of Defence has said it has no military personnel in the \u201ctargeting chain\u201d, and has denied ever offering Mr Cable such assurances. The inadequacy of any influence that Britain and the US have obtained in exchange for arms should be evident from the civilian death toll, repeated attacks on schools and hospitals, and growing evidence of the use of cluster bombs. Meanwhile, the conflict makes it easier for perpetrators of rights abuses elsewhere to brush aside criticism as sheer hypocrisy, and creates new opportunities for jihadists \u2013 surely not in British or American interests.</p> <p>Some in Saudi Arabia, too, question the wisdom of an expensive war as it drains coffers that are harder to fill thanks to lower oil prices. Riyadh fears Iran\u2019s growing power, and has no desire to see another country fall under its rival\u2019s sway; US officials <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/u-s-officials-iran-supplying-weapons-yemen-s-houthi-rebels-n674181\" title=\"\">say they have intercepted weapons shipments</a> to the rebels, which Iran denies, though some experts say that Tehran\u2019s support for the Houthis appears to be more rhetorical than substantial. In any case, Riyadh has now invested so much political credibility in this conflict that it cannot easily walk away. The international community needs to help it find a way out \u2013 and up the pressure to make sure it takes it. The UN peace deal presented to the various parties last month (but not disclosed publicly) offers some faint hope: it signals at least that there is an attempt to move beyond simple demands for a restoration of the government and look for a realistic solution. But resolution is a long way off, and Mr Hadi\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.dw.com/en/yemeni-president-turns-down-un-peace-deal/a-36197749\" title=\"\">rejection of the deal</a> is unsurprising, since it appears that it would have sidelined him.</p> <p>In the meantime, the absurdities mount. Half of the $115bn worth (\u00a392bn) of weapons sales <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/08/obama-administration-offered-115-billion-weapons-saudi-arabia-report\" title=\"\">agreed under the Obama administration</a> are still in the pipeline. Meanwhile, its ambassador to the UN, Samantha Power, has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/31/us-calls-for-end-to-saudi-airstrikes-in-yemen\" title=\"\">urged Riyadh to halt indiscriminate strikes</a>. The UK, which has <a href=\"https://www.caat.org.uk/resources/export-licences/licence?rating=Military&amp;region=Saudi+Arabia&amp;date_from=2015-04&amp;date_to=2016-03\" title=\"\">licensed \u00a33.3bn worth of sales</a> since the Yemen conflict began, boasts of increasing aid by \u00a337m. The pledge would be laughable if it was not so shameful. By August, the damage caused by war already stood at <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-yemen-security-damages-idUSKCN10R2B7\" title=\"\">an estimated $14bn</a>. The aid will go only a short way to repairing that \u2013 and no sum can restore lost limbs or revive the dead.</p> <p>Such contradictions are fuelling calls by both US and UK politicians for a halt to arms sales and support. Beside the overwhelming moral case is the legal one: arms cannot be sold where there is a clear risk that they will be used in breach of international humanitarian law. There can now be little doubt that that is the case. The US has warned that security cooperation with Saudi Arabia is <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2016/10/08/statement-nsc-spokesperson-ned-price-yemen\" title=\"\">not a blank cheque</a> and announced <a href=\"http://warontherocks.com/2016/10/what-a-real-review-of-u-s-military-assistance-to-saudi-arabia-would-say/\" title=\"\">a \u201cpolicy review\u201d</a> \u2013 likely to mean kicking the issue into the long grass.

That is due to be heard early next year. But each day of delay means more stunted children, more maimings, more homes destroyed, more lives torn apart, more deaths by starvation or bombardment. There is no time to lose. Britain and the US should halt arms sales now.</p>",

Shortly afterwards Sydney FC\u2019s right-back was deservedly named the man of the match. It was a topsy-turvy night.<br></p> <p>It was as much a battle of wills as it was football. A pair of strutting alpha clubs and their headstrong coaches refusing to take a backward step in an interstate pissing contest. But what at times may have seemed like posturing and hot air mattered nonetheless.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/nov/05/krishna-double-sparks-phoenix-a-league-win-over-newcastle\">David Carney double gets Sydney FC past Victory, Krishna fires Phoenix</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In the early weeks of the season the prevailing strategic battle has been between competing interpretations of proactive football. Almost all teams, whether at home or away, are now setting out to dominate possession and control tempo; it\u2019s the modern way. But the evenness of the A-League and the uniformity of approach can lead to stalemate. That arm-wrestle for control is vital.</p> <p>In seasons past Victory might have travelled north happy to sacrifice territory and possession early on to safeguard its defensive structure. Equally, once it became obvious that Sydney were vulnerable to sharp incursions down the flanks the Sky Blues might have instructed their wide attackers to double up on the visiting wingers and place a greater emphasis on avoiding mid-pitch turnovers. Not on Saturday. The Big Blue was a high-stakes face off with neither combatant daring to blink.</p> <p>The outcome was a collection of moments that combined to form a game, more than the methodical reveal of a cohesive narrative. Such was the power and controversy of those moments, the match soared to dramatic peaks. </p> <p>In the first half they belonged almost exclusively to Melbourne Victory. Marco Rojas should have scored from open play and Besart Berisha should have buried a spot kick. When he didn\u2019t, the posturing and hot air spilled into ugly goading of the penalty taker that reflected poorly on the Sydney players involved. </p> <p>After surviving two such gilt-edged chances, and arriving into the game without conceding a goal all season, there was disbelief when Sydney\u2019s defence was so collectively sloppy in allowing Mitch Austin to open the scoring. The well-timed finish capped Austin\u2019s best half for Victory in the A-League, but afforded greater licence there is surely more to come. He appears under instructions to cross early and often to exploit Berisha\u2019s movement on the shoulder of the last defender, but in preseason and at the Central Coast Mariners, Austin looked most dangerous powering his way to the byline or into the box. </p> <p>Kevin Muscat wasn\u2019t exaggerating when he remarked after the game that his side should have been \u201c2-0 or 3-0 up at half-time\u201d. But at just 1-0, history was still on his side. On 80 of 98 previous occasions that Victory had led at the break in the A-League they\u2019d gone on to win \u2013 and only once during the other 18 had they relinquished all three points. But this was a game played in its own bubble to its own rules.</p> <p>Things began to change after the break as Sydney asserted their will with greater authority. Possession was retained with more composure, denying Victory the forward momentum they rely on.</p> <p>Grant, Josh Brillante and Alex Brosque in particular displayed the character of a team that would not be cowed. It wasn\u2019t pretty, Brosque especially testing Chris Beath\u2019s patience with a string of indiscretions, but it was further evidence this season\u2019s Sky Blues relish a fight. Graham Arnold seized brilliantly on his team\u2019s growing authority with the introduction of David Carney in the 59th minute, the decisive moment of the game.</p> <p>\u201cI just thought young [Stefan] Nigro was getting tired,\u201d Arnold told Fox Sports after the game about his observations of Victory\u2019s left-back. \u201cCarns is very good one versus one and having a left-footer on the right side coming inside might cause some trouble\u201d. The veteran did indeed cause trouble, transforming the match with two superbly taken goals. Nigro was culpable for both. Plans won\u2019t always work as effectively as this but the Sydney boss deserves to bask in a few days of managerial glory. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/nov/06/ffa-to-review-pitchside-equipment-after-michael-zullos-table-collision\">FFA to review pitchside equipment after Michael Zullo's table collision</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Victory can feel aggrieved that the referee failed to spot Carney\u2019s clear handball in the buildup to his equaliser but the hapless Nigro not only had the misfortune to miss his clearing header but in so doing obscured Beath\u2019s view of a blatant foul.</p> <p>For Sydney, the Big Blue was always going to be the first major test of the campaign, and it\u2019s one they\u2019ve passed.

As a recently retired teacher of maths in prison, a job that I enjoyed immensely and where I came across a majority of motivated and diligent students with just a few resistant agitators, it seems to me that the general drift in offender education is the reverse of what is actually needed and has been given little thought in this radical new initiative, which is neither radical nor new.</p> <p>The main provider of prison education in England sees this as a&#xa0;business opportunity and not a true mission to improve people\u2019s life chances. Constant squeezing of the teachers\u2019 terms, conditions and pay has led to an increasingly demoralised, casual and less-qualified workforce mirroring the situation in teaching in general, but amplified to an even greater degree. Closure of classes in painting and decorating, bricklaying and plastering \u2013 which would give real skills and job opportunities \u2013 for ones that can deliver immediate financial returns but fewer jobs in the real community does not work in the prisoners\u2019 best interests. A&#xa0;constant drive to meet targets involving qualifications of doubtful benefit, notwithstanding the fact that the introduction of functional skills has been a good development, does not give prisoners the bits of paper that will really help them. I could carry on.</p> <p>Prison education is a fundamental component of any reform strategy and needs creativity, imagination and a motivated, competent, decently rewarded and dedicated and secure staff, but if it continues to be driven as a commercial venture based on marketing, intimidation, target culture and a casual and cowed workforce with poor leadership it will continue to fail the prisoners.<br><strong>Jan Wiczkowski</strong><br><em>Manchester</em></p> <p>\u2022 It isn\u2019t just bleeding-heart Guardian readers who want prisons to rehabilitate rather than punish those who are let down by the understaffing of prisons.

Indeed, to see that prison is \u201ca total institution\u201d, without any reference to the transition from prison to the community (commonly known as \u201cthrough the prison gate\u201d), is simply to reinforce the lack of strategic vision that characterises government\u2019s criminal justice policy.</p> <p>More offenders are going to prison for a variety of reasons (some acceptable, some less so); prison officer numbers are reducing; violence in both the male and female estate is escalating at an alarming rate. The government introduces a complete shake-up of the probation service in order to assist in short-term prisoner rehabilitation. Reports from the Inspectorate of Probation suggest this is failing badly. Where is the strategic vision? Where is the understanding and realisation that penology requires a whole-system approach, not an issue-by-issue kneejerk response?<br><strong>Andy Stelman</strong><br><em>Bishop\u2019s Castle, Shropshire</em></p> <p>\u2022 Your leader could have been written 40 years ago when I first joined the probation service. In essence, the debate is unchanged from that time. Perhaps there is a crisis in prisons because of the significant reduction in operational staff, but you are right to point out that fewer prison officers has nothing to do with the unacceptable size of the prison population and the consequent pressures therein.</p> <p>Clearly prisons need more staff, but what we are also now seeing is the deleterious effect of the ideological and systematic changes imposed on the probation service from the mid-1990s onwards. The fundamental shift from care and control (rooted in rehabilitation) to punishment and enforcement (rooted in \u201cprotection of the public\u201d), which began around that time, has meant that probation service interventions have tended to add to prison numbers rather than being significantly influential in their reduction. I\u2019m not saying that protection of the public isn\u2019t a necessary consideration for any criminal justice agency, or indeed that the probation service does not still undertake valuable rehabilitative work. But its position with courts, policymakers and the community at large, as a primary alternative to custody, somehow has got lost and it is hard to see things changing for the better with regard to sentencing and prison numbers until that important ground is regained.<br><strong>Michael J Miller</strong><br><em>Shipley, West Yorkshire</em></p> <p>\u2022 There has been no mention of the probation service in all the press coverage of the prisons crisis.</p> <p>I qualified as a probation officer at LSE in 1956.

  "<p>Sixty years ago, to echo Professor Colin Pritchard (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/nov/01/my-part-in-a-war-in-suez\" title=\"\">My part in a war crime in Suez</a>, Letters, 2 November), I was in the first term of my O-level year at a London grammar school, too young for national service though I had been eager to join the Royal Navy. Our form master required all boys to write a news diary to encourage us to think critically about current affairs. My then best friend and I set to, his family Daily Mirror readers, mine the Express, while my nonconformist history master encouraged us to read the Manchester Guardian. By the start of the autumn term, when we schoolboy diarists began our chronicle, British and French armed forces were deployed in the eastern Mediterranean to \u201ctake back control\u201d (in the vernacular) of the Suez canal from the Egyptians after its nationalisation. But it would be half-term before the Israelis launched their attack across the Sinai against Egypt and the Anglo-French forces played their part in the tripartite plot by bombing the canal zone. The duplicity of British and French governments in calling for the disengagement of the Egyptian-Israeli forces was patent, even to 15-year-olds in Marylebone \u2013 yet to learn of the centuries of efforts by western powers to control the Middle East. It would take perhaps a decade for one of the schoolboy chroniclers to realise the duplicity of the United States in its Suez policy, just one of the stages in the long history of American intervention in the Middle East \u2013 an area then officially defined as stretching from Morocco to Pakistan.<br><strong>Professor Michael Dunne</strong><br><em>Brighton</em></p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Join the debate \u2013 email </em></strong><a href=\"mailto:guardian.letters@theguardian.com\" title=\"\"><strong><em>guardian.letters@theguardian.com</em></strong></a></p>",

In September 2015 it had emerged that VW had installed software to deactivate pollution controls on more than 11m diesel vehicles sold worldwide.</p> <p>Following a complaint by financial watchdog BaFin, prosecutors are already investigating the former VW boss <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/sep/23/volkswagen-ceo-martin-winterkorn-quits-over-diesel-emissions-scandal\">Martin Winterkorn</a> and brand chief Herbert Diess.

  "<p>Two outstanding rides made all the difference for the European team at Santa Anita on Saturday night, as Frankie Dettori took his score at the Breeders\u2019 Cup to a round dozen aboard Queen\u2019s Trust in the Filly &amp; Mare Turf and Seamie Heffernan enjoyed his first win at the meeting <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/nov/06/highland-reel-aidan-obrien-breeders-cup-frankie-dettori-queens-trust-horse-racing\" title=\"\">on Highland Reel in the Turf.</a> Dettori, predictably, performed a flying dismount afterwards. Heffernan, just as predictably, did not.</p> <p>Heffernan will never be a household name like Dettori or move markets like Ryan Moore but his career record now includes 26 victories at Group One or Grade One level. In what is, by definition, a highly competitive business he has found a niche as a perennial No2 at Aidan O\u2019Brien\u2019s stable and, when it comes to making the best of one\u2019s opportunities, there is no one in the sport to match him.</p> <p>Moore, O\u2019Brien\u2019s principal jockey, was scarcely sighted on either day at Santa Anita. Found, the Arc winner, was the only one of his six rides to make the frame and she simply stayed on into third place in the Turf without ever threatening the winner.</p> <p>But then none of Highland Reel\u2019s opponents managed to threaten his lead either, as Heffernan seized his latest opportunity with a rare flourish. He was in control of the race from the opening strides and in effect secured victory almost half a mile out as he opened a lead that Highland Reel, a multiple winner at the highest level, was never going to surrender.</p> <p>Plenty of the spectators in the 70,000-strong crowd pointed fingers at Heffernan\u2019s opponents, with Javier Castellano a particular target for his ride on Flintshire, the second-favourite. Yet Heffernan executed his own plan so adroitly that there was very little the rest of them could do about it.</p> <p>Moore, of course, will be back aboard Highland Reel if he now runs in either Japan or Hong Kong at the tail-end of the season, but Heffernan is fine with that.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve been there a long time and I went there as a second jockey and work rider,\u201d he said on Saturday. \u201cI get very, very well looked after. More recently my name is coming out of the hat for the rides and I\u2019m happy with my position. There\u2019s no pressure. I\u2019m never really on the first string, though the first and third string can be equal, never mind the second string.\u201d</p> <p>O\u2019Brien himself always bends over backwards to stress that Ballydoyle\u2019s success is a team effort. Heffernan has now been part of that team for two decades \u2013 his first Group winner for O\u2019Brien was in August 1996 \u2013 and his Santa Anita victory was one of the most memorable moments of what was, even by the standards of the Breeders\u2019 Cup, an exceptional weekend.</p> <p>Dettori\u2019s win on Queen\u2019s Trust was another. The horsemanship, timing and confidence that have made him one of the all-time greats were all in evidence as he squeezed Sir Michael Stoute\u2019s filly past Lady Eli, the favourite, in the final stride, and then waggled his whip to celebrate victory a moment later. Dettori was seemingly the only person at Santa Anita who was absolutely confident that Queen\u2019s Trust had got up and, as so often, he was spot on.</p> <p>The memories that will live longest for the American fans, however, will be the contests which closed the cards on Friday and Saturday night. After one of the great stretch duels between Beholder and the previously unbeaten Songbird in Friday\u2019s Distaff, it seemed greedy to hope for something to match it in the Classic on Saturday night but the race between Arrogate and California Chrome which closed the meeting was every bit as good.</p> <p>As California Chrome, the darling of the Santa Anita crowd, led the field into the stretch, Arrogate, who made his racecourse debut only a few days after California Chrome\u2019s win in the Dubai World Cup in March, seemed to be struggling to close the gap. Yet Mike Smith, his jockey, kept asking for more and Arrogate kept finding it. With just under a furlong to run, there was a visible moment when the balance of power shifted towards Arrogate, like a shuddering punch in a boxing ring, and he landed his blow so late that the old champion had no time to respond.</p> <p>Arrogate, with only five starts on his record before Saturday, is the most lightly raced Classic winner in Breeders\u2019 Cup history and the best news of all is that he will stay in training next season, when the Classic at Del Mar, a few hundred miles down the coast near San Diego, will presumably be his big target.</p> <p>Before that it is possible that Arrogate will find a berth in the Pegasus Cup, a new event to be staged at Gulfstream Park in January and also the race that is likely to be the last of California Chrome\u2019s career. The Pegasus Cup\u2019s $12m purse, which will make it the world\u2019s richest race, is funded by selling a dozen places in the line-up to leading owners at $1m apiece and, while Prince Khalid Abdullah\u2019s Juddmonte Farms operation did not buy a berth originally, there seems little doubt that it will be able to acquire one if necessary.</p> <p>The Pegasus Cup\u2019s unusual format and sudden appearance in the racing programme has not met with universal approval in the States. First impressions are often the most important, however, and a rematch between Arrogate and California Chrome would be a very good way to announce its arrival.</p>",
  "<p>The trajectory of the spirit of Brexit has all the characteristics of a tantrum \u2013 they wanted to leave the EU, and the desire was indivisible from the rage that accompanied it.

A tantrum cannot be reasoned with. Meeting its demands only makes it worse. It isn\u2019t asking for satisfaction, it is asking for a boundary. This is the urgent task of the rest of the nation, whether regretful remainer or sane, puzzled leaver: to stop reacting to the outbursts and set some meaningful boundaries.</p> <p>It is no doubt possible, but I have so far found it extremely difficult, to engage with what a post-Brexit Britain should look like. Refusing to accept that Brexit is happening makes it very difficult, but the vote for Brexit has happened. Its particulars could range from the merely destructive to the outright disastrous, and depend on many more variables than the qualities and decisions of our own politicians (it is paradoxical that we have never been more reliant on the kindness of the continent than when we try to assert our independence from it).</p> <p>It is possible, as many have pointed out, that when the full consequences start to emerge, we will find parliamentary means to water them down. But nobody \u2013 not Tony Blair, not Nick Clegg, not John Major, not any of these once-vilified figures who periodically pop up as a voice of reason \u2013 is going to act the saviour here. No technicality will be found to stop Brexit, nobody will snap their fingers and wake us up.</p> <p>It\u2019s not enough to point to looming catastrophes and say what we don\u2019t want; it\u2019s not enough to concentrate on what we might lose. We need to consider what could be better, in a Brexited Britain. That is dauntingly open-ended until we establish whose and which interests we want to press: they needn\u2019t be exclusive.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>On workers\u2019 rights, we can tackle problems such as zero-hours contracts and Sports Direct-esque hyper-surveillance</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Last week the <a href=\"https://fabianwomen.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Fabian Women\u2019s Network</a> launched a charter to protect the rights whose loss would have most impact on women. There were five clusters: maintaining workplace rights; replacing European Social Fund (ESF) money; tackling hate crimes; protecting reproductive autonomy and freedom from violence; and pushing for better female representation at the highest levels of politics and business.</p> <p>Initially, I thought it was a mistake to set any limit \u2013 even the broad limit of one entire gender \u2013 when conceiving what \u201cbetter\u201d would look like, in the context of what will amount to a constitutional remodelling. In fact, each sectional interest, rather than being a limit, is more like a guy rope holding up the whole.</p> <p>Sticking with a feminist agenda, what could we push for beyond the language of \u201csafeguarding\u201d and \u201cprotection\u201d? Are there new ways of discussing old issues \u2013 the role of occupational segregation in pay inequality, for example \u2013 that would take us beyond simply upholding the law? At a practical level, all organisations whose income partly depends on the ESF have to come together and build a detailed picture of what they need from the Brexit negotiations, as well as a&#xa0;plain, unified argument explaining why they need it. This should be fruitful, as the pressure of the coming crisis forces a new articulation of shared aims and values.</p> <p>And what of workers\u2019 rights? If we\u2019re building a new framework for employee rights, we can do more than ensure that leaving the EU doesn\u2019t intensify inequality. We can tackle head-on the conditions that have made people\u2019s lives worse, from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/mar/09/uk-workers-on-zero-hours-contracts-rises-above-800000\" title=\"\">zero-hours contracts</a> to Uber-style non-contracts to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/09/sports-direct-warehouse-work-conditions\" title=\"\">Sports Direct-esque hyper-surveillance</a>. We can determine what decency means, in the relationship between employer and employee, and find a way to iterate it, rather than sliding into neo-serfdom, pausing only for some periodic outrage against Philip Green or Mike Ashley.</p> <p>Environmental legislation was always one of the strongest arguments in the EU\u2019s favour, the exemplification of all that was long-term, constructive and democratic in its activity, the place you could go to rebut the quite reasonable charge that union was technocratic and overloaded with bureaucracy. It was unwieldy, it was slow, but once it made legislation, it stayed made. Once it decided that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jun/09/what-has-the-eu-ever-done-for-my-beach\" title=\"\">beaches should be clean</a>, they stayed clean. We categorically do not need to take a vote to leave as a mandate to re-toxify everything, especially given that the Brexiters scarcely mentioned the environment. The pressing danger is that environmental matters simply slide off the agenda, on a slope of anti-science innuendo and deliberate avoidance. That is a risk we can only take on by establishing a green agenda that is not a bare minimum, but an audacious maximum.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/nov/05/lawyers-war-liz-truss-over-abuse-judges-brexit-barristers\">Brexit: lawyers confront Liz Truss over \u2018dangerous\u2019 abuse of judges</a> </p> </aside>  <p>What is extraordinary about the Brexit tantrum is that those having it often dismiss national prosperity \u2013 usually as a secondary concern, behind controlling borders, but occasionally even as an irrelevance, a detail that only pessimists and sore losers talk about. It is not an irrelevance, and the fears of businesses, the financial sector in particular, are real.</p> <p>Creating the blueprint for a workable Brexit that serves the national interest is more than a chance to unite complementary progressive agendas. It can reunite voices that should never have been separated: employers and employees, businesses, equality campaigners, greens. It has served the interests of far-right conservatives to claim that businesses and workers are implacably opposed: the first creating wealth, the second draining it. It was never true \u2013 profit is a thin motivator, most businesses think of themselves as working for the social good \u2013 and those extremists\u2019 interests have been indulged long enough.</p> <p>If one positive thing has come out of the past week, indeed, out of the entire referendum fiasco, it is clarity: the hard Brexiters can never be satiated, they know no restraint.

Michael Carrick, who was making his first Premier League start of the season, was excellent in the midfield holding role, Wayne Rooney thrived on the left and Ibrahimovic looked as if he was enjoying playing football again.</p> <p>It was, in short, just what United needed after that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/nov/03/fenerbahce-manchester-united-europa-league-match-report\" title=\"\">chastening defeat against Fenerbahce</a> in the Europa League on Thursday night and all the more satisfying for Mourinho given that he was forced to name such a makeshift defence. Phil Jones made his first appearance since January, Ashley Young was deployed at right-back, Marcos Rojo featured as an auxiliary centre-half and Matteo Darmian played out of position on the left.

Mike van der Hoorn\u2019s headed clearance was poor but Pogba, loitering about 22 yards from goal, showed wonderful technique to get over the top of a bouncing ball and send it arrowing into the top corner with his right boot.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/nov/05/swansea-city-premier-league-modou-barrow-gambia\">Swansea\u2019s Modou Barrow: \u2018People living near me in Gambia die on that route\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Swansea looked shellshocked, United were moving the ball around with ease and it was no surprise when the visitors added a second. After a long period of United possession Rooney laid the ball back and Ibrahimovic, in an abundance of space, sidestepped Ki Sung-yueng\u2019s half-hearted attempt to close him down before drilling a low shot from just outside the area that Lukasz Fabianski should have saved. Instead the ball slipped inside the Swansea goalkeeper\u2019s near post and Ibrahimovic celebrated ending a run of 609 minutes without scoring in the Premier League.</p> <p>The Swede soon had his second and United\u2019s third. Linking well with Rooney in the centre of the pitch after neatly controlling David de Gea\u2019s long ball upfield, Ibrahimovic traded passes with the United captain, shrugged off \u00c0ngel Rangel and lifted the ball beyond Fabianski. It was to all intents game over with almost an hour remaining.</p> <p>Van der Hoorn reduced the deficit in the second half when he headed in Gylfi Sigurdsson\u2019s free-kick and Modou Barrow was later denied by De Gea but there was never any prospect of a Swansea comeback and Juan Mata, expertly set up by Rooney, could easily have added a fourth.</p>",

  "<p>It is a question that is often put to Tottenham Hotspur\u2019s players in those slightly quirky interviews. Who is the best player at the club? They give the same answer every time: Mousa Demb\u00e9l\u00e9. When Vincent Janssen was asked it recently, he went for Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 and the summer signing added that it was also because he was the best player he had ever faced. It is worth noting that Janssen has come up against Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 only in training.</p> <p>Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 is not the highest-profile Tottenham player \u2013 perhaps because he is laid back to the point of being horizontal \u2013 and there was a brighter spotlight at the Emirates Stadium on Harry Kane, who returned after seven weeks out with ankle ligament damage. Kane, inevitably, commandeered attention after his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/nov/06/arsenal-tottenham-hotspur-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">equaliser from the penalty spot</a>, because scoring against Arsenal is part of what has defined his White Hart Lane legend.</p> <p>It was the fourth Premier League derby in succession in which he had found the back of the Arsenal net and Mauricio Pochettino acknowledged the emotional uplift that the striker had provided, even if this was not a vintage Kane performance. He will need a little longer to blow off the cobwebs.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/nov/06/arsenal-tottenham-hotspur-premier-league-match-report\">Harry Kane spot-on to claim draw for Tottenham at Arsenal on return</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It was Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 who was the star turn and his influence was summed up in the moment shortly after half-time when he got on the ball and drove at the Arsenal penalty area, using that combination of strength, technique and deceptive pace to glide away from Francis Coquelin and inside Nacho Monreal. When he was clipped by Laurent Koscielny, the referee, Mark Clattenburg, had no option but to point to the spot, despite what Ars\u00e8ne Wenger said afterwards about the decision being harsh.</p> <p>Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 had been a fitness doubt after he twisted his ankle in the first half of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/nov/02/tottenham-bayer-leverkusen-champions-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Tottenham\u2019s Champions League defeat by Bayer Leverkusen</a> on Wednesday night, but it was reassuring in the extreme for Pochettino to be able to select him because, if there is one thing that the midfielder brings, it is reassurance.</p> <p>Whenever Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 received the ball, he bought time for his team and found the angles and spaces for them to play. He was fiendishly difficult, as ever, to knock off the ball and his short passing carried its trademark fizz and incision. It has been a stop-start season for Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 because of the suspension that he carried over from the previous campaign for his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/06/tottenham-mousa-dembele-six-game-ban-diego-costa\" title=\"\">gouge on Chelsea\u2019s Diego Costa</a> and the niggling series of injuries that he has suffered.</p> <p>This seemed like a fresh start and Pochettino\u2019s response, when asked to comment on Demb\u00e9l\u00e9\u2019s performance, said it all. \u201cDemb\u00e9l\u00e9 is a genius,\u201d the manager said.</p> <p>Tottenham needed reassurance, particularly after the Leverkusen defeat, in which they had been almost implausibly bad. They came to the Emirates having not won in six matches in all competitions and having scored only three times during the run.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/nov/06/arsene-wenger-victor-wanyama-arsenal-tottenham-hotspur\">Victor Wanyama was lucky not to be sent off, says Ars\u00e8ne Wenger</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It had seemed as if the priority had been to restore a measure of stability and Pochettino\u2019s three-at-the-back approach was designed to give them the platform to play, especially out of defence. This is the basic tenet of his style and it had been a glaring problem in the Leverkusen game.</p> <p>It was impressive to see how Tottenham adapted to a system they had never played under Pochettino. At Watford last season he had used a 3-4-2-1 formation, with \u00c9rik Lamela and Dele Alli behind Kane, but here it was 3-3-2-2 at the outset, with Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 and Christian Eriksen in front of Victor Wanyama in midfield, and behind Kane and Son Heung-min.</p> <p>Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 was the central figure, pushed higher than might have been expected in the first half \u2013 with the instruction to unsettle Arsenal\u2019s screening midfielders and give free rein to his creative impulses. Tottenham were the better team in the first half of the first half, whereas Arsenal came to control the second part of it.</p> <p>Pochettino is sometimes criticised for having no Plan B, even though he has advanced the 4-1-4-1 formation that he has used of late as the example of one. Here it was Plan C and it was certainly a ballsy move to make the change in the derby and to give Kevin Wimmer his first minutes of the Premier League season in the middle of the back three. Wimmer was booked early on for a reckless lunge at Coquelin and, when he lost his bearings to head into his own net, it appeared as though he would be the villain of the piece.</p> <p>Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 helped to spare him that fate. He played a little deeper after the interval, in what was more like a 3-4-1-2, and what shone through in the second half was Tottenham\u2019s character. With their backs to the wall, they came out fighting. The draw was the fair result. Pochettino\u2019s team had been unrecognisable against Leverkusen. This was more like it.</p>",
  "<p>Someone threw a dildo on to the playing&#xa0;field. It happened last Sunday, during the third quarter of&#xa0;<a href=\"http://mashable.com/2016/10/30/dildo-buffalo-bills-patriots-nfl/\" title=\"\">a&#xa0;nationally televised NFL game between the Buffalo Bills and the New England Patriots</a>. Millions of Americans watched, rolled their eyes and thought to themselves: \u201cWell, that about sums it up.\u201d</p> <p>So, who threw it? A Hillary supporter, obviously. Someone fed up with all the degradation women have been subjected to in this election: infidelity, groping, sexting, the whole septic undertow of alpha-male sludge currently spewing into the Atlantic and Pacific. And, finally, one lone heroine stood up and hurled an allegorical Johnson on to a football field, where it got trampled by 22 pairs of male feet.</p> <p>Or \u2026 was it a Trumpster? A lifelong blue-collar Buffaloan who has watched his city\u2019s industrial prowess wane? Maybe his daddy made dildos and his granddaddy made dildos, and then Hillary became senator and all those dildo jobs moved overseas. And now these New England Patriots \u2013&#xa0;east coast intellectual elites \u2013 show up with their&#xa0;crooked, <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/us-sport/national-football-league/tom-brady-superstar-or-cheat-or-both-10255442.html\" title=\"\">ball-deflating quarterback, Tom Brady</a>, and humiliate Buffalo on their home field.&#xa0;So, in&#xa0;a&#xa0;desperate act of defiance, an angry&#xa0;man hurls&#xa0;an inferior Chinese-made dildo at&#xa0;the Patriots\u2019 offence. A way of saying: \u201cThe Revolution Has Begun.\u201d</p> <p>Make no mistake: it was a political event. Americans are frustrated and they are throwing dildos. They\u2019re fed up and they don\u2019t give a rat\u2019s ass if the rest of the world is laughing at them. The air of \u201cfresh start\u201d is no longer alive in most places in America. We are sleepwalking into oblivion and for those, like me, raised in the twilight of a world where being president was still&#xa0;a noble thing, it cuts pretty deep. History has&#xa0;always been able to extract some shred of sacrosanctity from the electoral process, no matter how awful it turned out. But it\u2019s looking as if that warranty has expired and our republic is now an ageing Maytag churning through its final rinse cycle. Whatever comes out is going to be damp, foetid and reeking of effluviant. And we\u2019re gonna have to wear it.</p> <p>If Trump wins, I\u2019m going to enjoy the spectacle of a man wrestling within himself. Driven by inherent narcissism, he would strive to be The Greatest President Ever, a trait we look for in our leaders. But if his itchy-finger temperament prevails, he might nuke Egypt simply because they lied about the cotton threadcount in his bedsheets.</p> <p>Hillary, on the other hand, is a dead-eyed cyborg, held together with rivets and WD-40. She has been encamped in our lives for so long that handing her the presidency somehow feels like a&#xa0;lifetime achievement award. But she\u2019s dirty and corrupt and contemptuous of national security. These are our choices, folks: a pair of assholes. What is an asshole? A person who thinks they\u2019re entitled to an advantage. A person who has immunised themselves against all criticism.</p> <p>They can\u2019t hear your complaints. They\u2019re too caught up in their own ambition. It\u2019s OK to be an asshole if you have talent. Pablo Picasso and Miles Davis were assholes, but we forgave them because they gave something back. And the reason they were assholes was because they couldn\u2019t abide anything that got in the way of their talent or vision. But Trump has no talent. And Hillary has no vision. No fresh vision, anyway. So the American voter has a dilemma. \u201cLet\u2019s see, should I go with <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2016/live-updates/general-election/real-time-fact-checking-and-analysis-of-the-first-presidential-debate/fact-check-has-trump-declared-bankruptcy-four-or-six-times/\" title=\"\">a six-times-bankrupt businessman</a> who once thought it was a genius idea to sell steaks at The Sharper Image?

America\u2019s greatest attribute has always been its ability to mythologise its stupid mistakes, to turn world-class blunders into cultural gold. We glorify our exceptionalism. We downplay our history of slavery, segregation, nativism and violence until we can find a way to&#xa0;turn it into a Hollywood blockbuster starring Chiwetel Ejiofor. Unlike Brits, we always forgive ourselves. But I don\u2019t know how we\u2019re ever going to illuminate Trump or Clinton with any kind of flattering historical rewrite.</p> <p>Besides, they have already been encapsulated perfectly in films: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/oct/23/back-to-the-future-writer-bad-guy-biff-was-based-on-donald-trump\" title=\"\">Biff in Back to the Future</a> and Mary Tyler Moore in Ordinary People.</p> <p>Who am I going to vote for? Hillary. Only because she lies 30% less than Trump. I\u2019m tempted to sit this whole thing out, but I can\u2019t. I still believe in the antiquated currency of the ballot. I am grateful, as an American, that two useful idiots have offered themselves up as scapegoats for everything wrong with my country. That\u2019s the beauty of having a president. When the world isn\u2019t treating us right, when the creepy kid at school goes out and shoots up the mall, when we\u2019re up to our asses in floodwater and raw sewage because the county commissioners didn\u2019t buy enough sandbags to shore up the levee, who has to show up and apologise? The president, that\u2019s who.</p> <p>Every night, the president crawls into bed and says: \u201cGuess what, honey? Half the people in the country today called me an asshole!\u201d</p> <p>God bless \u2019em.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Rich Hall\u2019s Presidential Grudge Match airs on 7 November at 9pm on BBC4.</em></p>",

Here\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/nov/04/premier-league-10-things-to-look-out-for-this-weekend\">what Simon Burnton wrote</a> in our big bumper bouncing weekend preview:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It took until mid-October for Watford to keep a clean sheet but having managed it for the first time at Middlesbrough three weeks ago they repeated the feat in their next two games, and, excluding stoppage time, Heurelho Gomes is but 120 seconds away from going 300minutes unbeaten. Away from home, only Arsenal and Tottenham have better defensive records. It is an impressive achievement, particularly given that of the four players who regularly contest the three central defensive positions in Walter Mazzarri\u2019s preferred formation only one \u2013 Youn\u00e8s Kaboul, a summer arrival from Sunderland for around \u00a33.5m \u2013 was signed for a fee, and Gomes was also a free transfer. But the mountainous Austrian centre-half Sebastian Pr\u00f6dl limped out of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/29/watford-hull-city-premier-league-match-report\">last week\u2019s victory over Hull</a>, apparently with a muscle injury, and with Craig Cathcart also injured it is likely only two of the four will be available for this, their sternest test of the season so far. </p> <p>Whether Mazzarri\u2019s response will be to bring in Christian Kabasele, the Belgium international who has played eight first-team minutes since August, or to move to a back four, a defence unchanged throughout their recent solid streak will be fundamentally altered. They face a team who have scored two or more goals in eight of their last nine games and have shown the ability to make even the most secure rearguards become bedraggled. There is, in short, plenty of encouragement for Liverpool, whose only obvious cause of concern would come if Nordin Amrabat, the Moroccan winger who made Hull\u2019s stand-in left-back Sam Clucas appear utterly wretched at Vicarage Road last week, manages to repeat the trick against James Milner, another player unaccustomed to that position, who is expected to return after missing the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/29/crystal-palace-liverpool-premier-league-match-report\">4-2 win at Crystal Palace</a>.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-581f31a6e4b07ceadb3a2f3f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-06T13:36:50.773Z\">1.36pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>This week Paul Wilson spoke to Emre Can,</strong> and via having the news broken to him that he wasn\u2019t in the German squad (bit awkward), <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/nov/05/emre-can-liverpool-steven-gerrard-jurgen-klopp\">the midfielder confirmed that he is not Steven Gerrard</a>.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It is very nice to be compared to Steven Gerrard but I know I am not at the same level,\u201d Can says with refreshing candour. \u201cThere is a long way to go there.

Modern football loves narrative.</strong> There\u2019s plenty of it around, stories around which the actual playing of the game must be framed. It\u2019s not enough simply to enjoy watching a match, but to understand the tales around it too. And to an extent that\u2019s understandable: without \u2018narrative\u2019, the North London derby from earlier would just be two teams who didn\u2019t have to travel very far on a Sunday lunchtime. But sometimes it does seem like it can get in the way of what we\u2019re all actually here for. </p> <p><strong>This game, though.</strong> This game seems to be absolutely free of narrative. The only mutual player is Jerome Sinclair, who played but 25 minutes of league football for Liverpool, in two dead games the season before last, and is yet to appear for Watford. The two managers have never faced each other. There have been no particularly controversial recent meetings between the two sides, unless you count Adam Bogdan flinging one into his own net as Liverpool\u2019s last goalkeeping resort last season. There was the time Tommy Mooney scored a winner for Watford at Anfield back in 1999, but only the dorkiest of narrative completists would place much significance on that. </p> <p><strong>What else have we got?</strong> Well, both sides can be delighted that the very epitome of footballing grace and delicacy John Barnes is a significant place in their respective histories, and perhaps we can all just take a moment to enjoy the great man, before we continue. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVkCILQTnpw\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/YVkCILQTnpw?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p><strong>Good god, that goal against QPR.</strong> It\u2019s worth reading <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2013/aug/22/on-second-thoughts-john-barnes\">Gregg Bakowski\u2019s paean to Barnes</a> from a few years ago, in which he discusses that strike.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Unshackled, his confidence and talent grew. His ability to beat players without appearing to change gear was a gift that only a select few players have ever been able to showcase. And for three years at Liverpool he did so effortlessly. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gQuqkuhG5s\">His second goal</a> in the 4-0 defeat of the league leaders QPR in October 1987 was a perfect example. After stealing the ball on the halfway line he picked up pace as he approached the penalty box, with Terry Fenwick and Paul Parker closing, he seamlessly shifted his hulking frame left and right to create a gap between them, before calmly emerging unscathed to slip the ball past David Seaman\u2019s outstretched left hand. \u201cWhenever would-be tacklers came sliding in, I tried to toe the ball past them, ride the challenge and regain balance and the ball on the other side. After I pushed the ball past Fenwick, I landed and brought the ball back with my left foot in one movement. It was difficult to see why I didn\u2019t fall over,\u201d explained Barnes in his autobiography, making the sublime seem simple. </p> </blockquote> <p><strong>What a player.</strong> But anyway. We\u2019ve got a bit distracted from the business at hand. Which is football, to enjoy without distractions. The point is that this is one of the few games - particularly one of the few involving Liverpool - that we can enjoy without bothering ourselves with peripherals. This is pure football.

  "<p>It is almost a year to the day since J\u00fcrgen Klopp stared in disbelief at Liverpool fans streaming out of Anfield before the end of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/nov/08/liverpool-crystal-palace-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">defeat by Crystal Palace</a>. No one quits early any more. With his side top of the Premier League and turning on the style on a weekly basis, these are the days for Liverpool to savour.</p> <p>Watford were not simply the fifth of six visitors beaten at Anfield this season but the latest team to feel and suffer the punishing effect of the formidable attack constructed by Klopp. Walter Mazzarri\u2019s side came with a proud defensive record to protect. It was obliterated inside 45 minutes as Liverpool swarmed to the Premier League summit for the first time since May 2014 with the kind of performance that suggests they might enjoy the view for a good while yet. Doubts may well surround Liverpool\u2019s defensive ability at set pieces but there was not a soul inside Anfield who would complain at getting first place and one intense attacking display after another in exchange.</p> <p>Once again, the incomparable front trident of Sadio Man\u00e9, Philippe Coutinho and Roberto Firmino punctured holes in the opposition backline. All three were on the scoresheet and Liverpool were three up before the break as Watford wilted under relentless pressure. The only surprise was that the visitors\u2019 record of not conceding a Premier League goal stretched to five hours and 25 minutes as Liverpool had eight presentable chances to score before Man\u00e9 commenced the onslaught with a cute header. The Senegal international scored the fifth, too, before being substituted to a standing ovation. \u201cIf we still had Su\u00e1rez,\u201d the Kop sang, \u201che\u2019d be on the bench.\u201d That may have been tongue in cheek but the tribute to Liverpool\u2019s collective power was merited. They have witnessed 13 different goalscorers in 14 matches this season and 10 in the Premier League alone.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2016/nov/06/liverpool-v-watford-premier-league-live\">Liverpool v Watford: Premier League \u2013 as it happened</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Watford also lost Heurelho Gomes to what appeared a serious injury to the goalkeeper\u2019s right knee on a galling afternoon for the men from Vicarage Road. They would have been behind early had Firmino, Lucas Leiva \u2013 deputising for the ill Dejan Lovren in central defence \u2013 or Coutinho not missed clear openings. Confirming Liverpool\u2019s threat is not confined to the front three, Emre Can and James Milner also had sight of Gomes\u2019s goal before the dam burst.</p> <p>Man\u00e9 was involved in almost every Liverpool break in the first half. He broke the deadlock when Daryl Janmaat switched off at a short corner between Milner and Coutinho, enabling the former Southampton forward to steal a yard on the defender and steer the Brazilian\u2019s cross home with his head.</p> <p>Three minutes later it was two as Nathaniel Clyne, Man\u00e9, Adam Lallana and Firmino combined to invite Coutinho to attack Watford\u2019s central defence. Liverpool\u2019s No10 duly obliged, cutting on to his right and driving a powerful low shot through the legs of Youn\u00e8s Kaboul and into the centre of the visitors\u2019 goal. Gomes was unsighted but also beaten easily as his knee gave way while attempting to correct his body shape. The keeper was helped off in clear distress by two members of Watford\u2019s medical staff. \u201cIt was a very bad knock but we won\u2019t know how bad it is until he has been checked in the next days,\u201d said the defeated manager.</p> <p>Can put the game beyond Mazzarri\u2019s team before half-time when he read Lallana\u2019s deep cross to perfection and headed the ball back across Gomes\u2019s replacement, Costel Pantilimon, at the far post. It could have been four in the first half but for Pantilimon tipping away a Milner free-kick that looked destined for the top corner.</p> <p>Number four did arrive from another flowing move, Lallana sweeping a low cross along the six-yard box for Firmino to convert at close range, before the Brazilian turned provider to set up Man\u00e9\u2019s second of the game. Jordan Henderson released Firmino clear on the right after winning a clearance from Pantilimon, he looked up, surveyed his options and rolled a perfect ball on to Man\u00e9\u2019s run for the striker to beat the keeper convincingly.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/nov/06/jurgen-klopp-liverpool-watford\">J\u00fcrgen Klopp says Liverpool can still improve after thrashing Watford</a> </p> </aside>  <p>To their credit, Watford did not take the hammering lying down and Loris Karius had to produce the first impressive saves of his Anfield career from \u00c9tienne Capoue and Miguel Britos before Janmaat, in acres of space inside the Liverpool area, steered a consolation into the far corner. But there was never any chance of Klopp\u2019s side easing off.</p> <p>Daniel Sturridge twice struck the crossbar after coming on for Lallana and it was his shot, parried by Pantilimon, that enabled his fellow substitute Georginio Wijnaldum to score his first Liverpool goal from the rebound.</p> <p>Six goals and at number one. Klopp surveys a new main stand when he turns around to check for any early leavers these days. There is also a different team in front of him and different belief around him.

  "<p>The investigative journalist Gavin MacFadyen, who has died aged 76, was founder-director of the Centre for Investigative Journalism in London. He set up the CIJ, which is funded through charitable foundations, in 2003 to address what he saw as a worsening media climate for serious, in-depth and critical reporting and, over the following 13 years, established its reputation as one of the pre-eminent investigative journalism training institutions in the world.</p> <p>Gavin intended the CIJ as a refuge for critically minded journalists who want to do adversarial, public interest journalism. He thought that journalists had become accessories to the powerful, rather than acting as a check upon them \u2013 in his view, journalism\u2019s role in a democratic society should be to comfort the afflicted and afflict the comfortable.</p> <p>It was not surprising that, in 2010, when WikiLeaks began publishing documents on the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, and then the US state department cables, Gavin became a close ally of the group and of its editor and founder, Julian Assange. While many of the institutions that profited from Assange\u2019s revelations later turned on him, Gavin was steadfastly loyal, seeing his role, as always, to stick up for those under fierce attack from powerful forces. Gavin and his wife Susan Benn were trustees of the Julian Assange Defence Fund, set up to help raise money for Assange\u2019s legal defence.</p> <p>Gavin\u2019s house in London was a salon and refuge for dissidents, journalists and revolutionaries from all over the world. People \u2013 often young, sometimes difficult \u2013 would stay for long periods and be fed and housed. \u201cI love it,\u201d Gavin once told me. \u201cI come down for breakfast and I don\u2019t know who is going to be there.\u201d He said the previous week \u201cthat brilliant Indian writer\u201d \u2013 Arundhati Roy \u2013 had been over with \u201cthat Hollywood actor with good politics\u201d \u2013 John Cusack. That was typical.</p> <p>The CIJ itself was wonderfully chaotic and breathed with creativity and energy. Gavin was an arch democrat, completely open to anyone and everyone. He wanted to stretch the definition of what an investigative journalist is, to include artists, historians and even architects who use society as their raw material and try to filter information to reveal truth. The CIJ was and remains an open shop.</p> <p>Born in Greeley, Colorado, to Marion Hall, a concert pianist, Gavin spent his formative years in Hyde Park, Chicago. He never knew his father, and in childhood took his stepfather\u2019s surname, MacFadyen. In the 1960s, he became an activist in the civil rights movement. In Chicago, he participated in the Rainbow Beach \u201cwade-ins\u201d of 1961 that challenged segregation on public beaches, and was arrested and jailed while protesting against discriminatory university housing, segregated restaurants and in defence of civil rights activists in the south.</p> <p>Gavin led a convoy of trucks filled with relief supplies to an embattled civil rights outpost in Tennessee. On arrival he discovered that police fire had pockmarked the truck with bullet holes, and on returning to Chicago he was informed that FBI agents had raided his house. In Chicago at this time, he met the young Bernie Sanders, then a student at Chicago University, and exposed him to the world of revolutionary leftist politics.</p> <p>By working subsequently as a longshoreman in New York, Gavin was able to pay for a trip to Britain, where he joined the International Socialists, living for a time in the home of one of its leading writers, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2003/mar/27/guardianobituaries.books1\" title=\"\">Michael Kidron</a>. He described this as a formative period in developing his political consciousness.</p> <p>Gavin attended the London School of Film Technique (the forerunner to the London Film School) in 1964, and shortly after graduation he formed an independent collective, Chicago Films. He filmed the 1968 Democratic Convention in Chicago, anti-war demonstrations and race riots in Detroit, Washington DC and Harlem for the BBC. As he became more interested in marrying his aesthetic commitment to film with his politics, he decided he wanted to make hard-hitting investigative documentaries.</p> <p>He produced and directed more than 50 documentaries, many for Granada Television\u2019s World in Action, in countries as diverse as Ecuador, Guyana, South Africa, Mexico, Hong Kong, Thailand, the USSR, the US, Sweden, India and Turkey. His investigations covered topics including industrial accidents, neo-Nazi violence in the UK, Chinese criminal societies, the history of the CIA, Watergate, election fraud in Guyana, the Iraq arms trade, child labour, nuclear proliferation, and Frank Sinatra\u2019s connection to organised crime.</p> <p>In 1980 Gavin left London to work in Hollywood. He became a close friend of the screenwriter, director and producer Michael Mann, and was involved in three of his films, as well as motion picture research projects in south-east Asia and a John Frankenheimer film project. He joined <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/dec/27/haskell-wexler\" title=\"\">Haskell Wexler</a> in Nicaragua to make the independent feature Latino in 1985. He also appeared as an actor in Latino, as well as two other movies, Thief (1981) and Ulterior Motives (1993).</p> <p>There was little time for small talk with Gavin; only the big ideas exercised him. He would throw his hands up when he got excited by a devious way of getting a story and shout \u201cyes, yes, YES!\u201d followed inevitably by \u201cLet\u2019s do it!\u201d Being around Gavin for any amount of time made you feel anything was possible and that, eventually, if Gavin was around to help, justice and the truth would prevail.</p> <p>One approach he favoured in the cause of linking social justice activism and investigative journalism was \u201cdirect action information gathering\u201d \u2013 for example, chaining yourself outside the offices of a multinational corporation or department of state and staying there until they gave you the information you needed for your story. He was unbreakable in his commitment to the oppressed, risked his own life and liberty to stand with them, and saw unspeakable acts of human brutality. Yet at the same time, none of it had broken down his ability to love and bring joy to those around him: his presence lit up any gathering.</p> <p>\u201cFor many journalists, work is simply a job,\u201d he once wrote. \u201cTheir interest is in lapdog confidences and dining with the powerful. Those who passionately want to provide a voice for those without one, and who fight hypocrisy and exploitation, are sadly rare.\u201d Gavin not only gave a voice to the voiceless. He handed them a megaphone.</p> <p>Gavin is survived by Susan, whom he married in 2010, his son Michael, from a previous marriage, to Virginia Daum, which ended in divorce, Susan\u2019s three daughters and six grandchildren.</p> <p><em> \u2022 </em>Gavin Hall MacFadyen, journalist, born 1 January 1940; died 22 October 2016</p>",

That\u2019s why we are putting in \u00a34bn more.\u201d</p> <p>But he added: \u201cIt isn\u2019t just about money \u2013 it\u2019s also about standards.\u201d</p> <p>Ensuring that lessons were learned from medical accidents could help save the NHS on legal bills, Hunt said. \u201cThere\u2019s lots of things we can do in terms of helping to ensure we are better at learning from mistakes, so that we don\u2019t have this huge legislation bill of \u00a31.5bn because of some of the mistakes we have made \u2013 that all helps on the money front.\u201d</p> <p>He added: \u201cThere are, of course, financial pressures, but I think it\u2019s a mistake to say this is only about money. It\u2019s also about getting the culture right.\u201d</p> <p>Winter is \u201cextremely tough\u201d for the health service, Hunt said: \u201cI can say I think we are better prepared this year than we have ever been.\u201d</p> <p>But he added: \u201cThere\u2019s always the unpredictable, the cold spells, the flu outbreaks and so on ... I think it would be wrong for any health secretary in the run-up to winter to say everything\u2019s tickety-boo.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>In July, <a href=\"http://www.unido.org/news/press/energy-central-to-so.html\">UN Secretary Ban Ki-Moon highlighted</a> the role of hydropower in boosting the use of renewable energy globally, when he visited a nonprofit institute in China that helps emerging nations develop and build hydropower plants. Many countries consider hydroelectricity a clean source of power because it doesn\u2019t involve burning dirty fossil fuels. But that\u2019s far from true. Hydropower is a significant source of greenhouse gas emissions: a new study shows that the world\u2019s hydroelectric dams are responsible for as much methane emissions as Canada.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://bioscience.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2016/10/02/biosci.biw117\">study</a> from Washington State University finds that methane, which is <a href=\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-bad-of-a-greenhouse-gas-is-methane/\">at least 34 times more potent</a> than another greenhouse gas, carbon dioxide, makes up 80% of the emissions from water storage reservoirs created by dams. What\u2019s more, none of these emissions are currently included in global greenhouse gas inventories. These are already revealing a worrisome future in which rising global temperatures will likely cause environmental changes such as rising sea levels and stronger hurricanes, which could uproot communities and intensify competition for food and other resources.</p> <p>\u201cI think this study shows that dams as a source of energy aren\u2019t without their greenhouse gas costs,\u201d says Bridget Deemer, a research ecologist at the US Geologic Survey, who led the study during her prior position as a research associate at Washington State. \u201cEven though it\u2019s a renewable source of energy, people should keep the greenhouse gas side of the picture in mind when making planning and policy decisions regarding dams.\u201d</p> <p>The research, which examines 100 recent studies on greenhouse gas emissions from 267 large reservoirs around the world, also calls into question the wisdom of building more hydroelectric dams as countries try to nix their dependence on coal, natural gas and oil. An estimated<a href=\"http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00027-014-0377-0\"> 3,700 new dams</a> are proposed or under construction around the globe, the study reports. It suggests the hydropower industry will need to control its emissions.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/oct/16/safer-small-nuclear-reactors-power-plant-technology\">This new technology could save the troubled nuclear power industry</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But industry officials in the US say the study misrepresents the benefit of hydropower in the fight to rein in global warming.</p> <p>\u201cSingling out hydropower is irresponsible and inaccurate, to say the least,\u201d says LeRoy Coleman, a spokesman for the<a href=\"http://www.hydro.org/\"> National Hydropower Association</a>, based in Washington DC. \u201cHydropower is needed to meet federal and state clean energy goals.\u201d</p> <p>Hydropower represents 6% of all energy generation in America, according to the<a href=\"https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.cfm?id=427&amp;t=3\"> US Energy Information Administration</a>. For newly built power plants, hydropower\u2019s<a href=\"https://www.eia.gov/forecasts/aeo/pdf/electricity_generation.pdf\"> total cost</a> of construction and operation runs about $68 per megawat-hour, which is comparable to solar, slightly more expensive than wind, and cheaper than coal and natural gas when those sources incorporate technology to capture carbon emissions.</p> <p>Hydropower is often considered a source of renewable electricity because its fuel, water, is constantly replenished by nature. By that standard, hydropower produces 52% of all renewable electricity in the US, according to the<a href=\"http://www.hydro.org/\"> National Hydropower Association</a>.</p> <p>Only 3% of reservoirs in the US are equipped to produce hydropower, Coleman says. Others are limited to water storage and flood protection duties, and some of them are good candidates for electricity generation, he adds.</p> <p>\u201cThe responsible and logical approach would be to capture the energy potential of these reservoirs and combat climate change by installing hydropower equipment,\u201d Coleman says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bd62943799f3d876ca8109c3c991d8612788095d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bd62943799f3d876ca8109c3c991d8612788095d/0_0_1453_830/1000.jpg\" alt=\"power plants\" width=\"1000\" height=\"571\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Top 10 power plants in the world/</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Ucilia Wang/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As recently as a decade ago, little was known about emissions from water storage reservoirs. But understanding has evolved rapidly. For instance, researchers initially thought shallow reservoirs in tropical regions were the largest emitters because their stored water was more prone to heating up, which could fuel greenhouse gas production.</p> <p>But analysis by Deemer and her colleagues shows that the latitude and depth of water are not leading factors. Instead, \u201cbiological activities\u201d in a reservoir \u2013 such as decaying vegetation and nutrient runoff from watersheds upstream \u2013 are more important indicators of greenhouse gas emissions. The nutrient runoff can be from natural processes or from farming, logging and land development.</p> <p>Using data from the 267 reservoirs, the authors estimate total emissions from all reservoirs worldwide and conclude that those water storage facilities account for 1.3% of all manmade greenhouse gas emissions.</p> <p>Another new<a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0161947\"> study</a> published by the journal PLOS One reaches similar conclusions, although it finds carbon dioxide to be a bigger share of emissions than methane. After examining data from more than 1,400 dams worldwide, it identifies the rate of soil erosion into a reservoir as a leading predictor of carbon dioxide emissions.</p> <p>Led by Laura Scherer, a research associate at the Swiss university ETH Zurich, that study concludes the \u201ccarbon footprint of hydropower is far higher than previously assumed\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThese are massive emissions, and we can\u2019t ignore that,\u201d says Kate Horner, executive director of the environmental group<a href=\"https://www.internationalrivers.org/\"> International Rivers</a>, based in Berkeley, California. \u201cThere are a massive number of dams that are currently proposed to be built. It would be a grave mistake to continue to finance those with the impression that they were part of the solution to the climate crisis.\u201d</p> <p>Coleman contends that it\u2019s premature to use data from these studies to criticize hydropower because the science remains uncertain.</p> <p>It is challenging to measure reservoir emissions because so many factors can play a role, Deemer acknowledges. The scientific community also doesn\u2019t follow a standard practice for counting emissions, even though the International Hydropower Association and the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (Unesco) published a set of<a href=\"https://www.hydropower.org/sites/default/files/publications-docs/GHG%20Measurement%20Guidelines%20for%20Freshwater%20Reservoirs.pdf\"> guidelines</a> in 2010.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/jul/31/california-wind-farm-energy-trident\">Can America's first floating wind farm shake off environmental concerns?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Emissions vary according to a wide variety of factors, including water and air temperatures, season and time of day, vegetation and soil types in both the reservoir and the upstream watershed, and watershed management practices.</p> <p>Hydropower dams constantly manipulate water levels to make electricity, a process that also affects the amount of emissions that make their way into the atmosphere from the reservoir. As water levels decline, the hydrostatic pressure on submerged soils also lowers and allows gas bubbles to escape. Sometimes the methane in these bubbles is absorbed by the water column and never reaches the surface. Other times it makes the great escape into the air.</p> <p>Deemer and her colleagues note that many studies don\u2019t sample emissions thoroughly enough both across reservoir surface area and over time. As a result, she says, the emissions estimates in her study are probably low.</p> <p>The challenge in measuring emissions also makes it difficult to figure out how to reduce them. Researchers speculate it may be possible to reduce emissions by managing water levels in a reservoir differently. This, however, could affect electricity generation, fishery and flood protection, and other operations.</p> <p>Protecting watersheds to reduce erosion into reservoirs could also reduce emissions as well as improve water quality, forest health and aquatic habitat.</p> <p>Global greenhouse gas inventories currently do not include emissions from reservoirs at all, but that is changing.</p> <p>At an October<a href=\"https://www.ipcc.ch/meetings/session44/l3_adopted_outline_methodology_report_guideline.pdf\"> meeting</a> in Bangkok, a committee of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change took a first step by agreeing to include reservoirs, which it categorizes as \u201cflooded lands\u201d, in an updated guidance document that instructs nations on accounting for their greenhouse gas emissions. But it may be several more years until that document is formally approved.</p> <p>The US government does not account for reservoir emissions in its own greenhouse gas inventory. The country is dotted with <a href=\"http://nationalmap.gov/small_scale/mld/dams00x.html\">roughly 79,000 dams</a>, including <a href=\"http://www.hydro.org/why-hydro/available/industrysnapshot/\">more than 2,200 </a>private and public hydropower plants. The<a href=\"http://www.usbr.gov/projects/dams.jsp\"> US Bureau of Reclamation</a>, for example, manages 337 reservoirs, and a science advisor to the agency, Dave Raff, says the bureau is taking on the emissions accounting task.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re engaged in trying to understand what the different mechanisms are for reservoirs as they generate these greenhouse gases,\u201d Raff says. \u201cAnd ultimately, what are the management levers we have to pull that could mitigate those. I do think we feel a sense of urgency to be on that path.\u201d</p> <ul> <li>The article was amended on 6 November 2016 to show that the cost of building and operating a hydropower plant is about $68 per megawtt-hour, not kilowatt-hour. </li> </ul>",

Among 10 rallies planned over the last two days were stops in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/29/minnesota-nice-clinton-sanders-deadlocked-super-tuesday\">Minnesota</a>, which has not supported a Republican presidential nominee since 1972, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/08/bernie-sanders-wins-michigan-primary-hillary-clinton\">Michigan</a>, which has not gone to the GOP since 1988. Clinton, however, lost both states to Bernie Sanders in the Democratic primary.</p> <p>Van Jones, a former adviser to Obama, told CNN\u2019s State of the Union: \u201cBeds are damp. There is a crack in the blue wall and it has to do with trade. This is the ghost of Bernie Sanders.\u201d</p> <p>The Trump campaign claimed \u201can enormous surge in momentum and enthusiasm\u201d in recent days, citing Minnesota, where the campaign said that in less than 24 hours it had 18,000 RSVPs for a event that could hold 5,000 people. It now sees \u201cat least six different paths\u201d to victory, aides said.</p> <p>Dave Bossie, deputy campaign manager, told reporters: \u201cWe have expanded the map. We are on offence. We are going to places no one thought we would. It\u2019s an incredibly exciting time for our campaign. Hillary Clinton is on defence and her map is shrinking. We feel we are peaking at the right time as a campaign.\u201d</p> <p>Clinton has led every poll in Michigan but she, Obama and Bill Clinton were all due to appear there before the vote. Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway said such major political figures were now playing \u201cfollow your leader\u201d in traditional Democratic states.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/08/state-factboxes/?id=MI\" data-alt=\"Michigan\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/08/state-factboxes/?id=MI\">Michigan</a> </figure>  <p>\u201cWe feel very good about the fact that we\u2019re actually setting the landscape here and they\u2019re chasing us around in these blue states,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cWe have seen our prospects improving in Michigan for quite a while now internally and we do see that now reflected in some of the public polling. We also like what we hear on the ground in Michigan ... and we trust the savviness and brilliance of the Clinton campaign.</p> <p>\u201cIf they thought Michigan was in the bag, Hillary Clinton, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama would not be returning there today or tomorrow.\u201d</p> <p>Democrats insisted that was because there is no early voting in the state, so they want to fire up the base. Clinton campaign chair John Podesta told NBC\u2019s Meet the Press: \u201cIf we hold on to Nevada, if we hold on to Michigan, then Hillary Clinton is going to be the next president of America.</p> <p>\u201cMost people vote on election day in Michigan, so our schedule has been oriented toward being in the early vote states in the earlier period of time. We feel like we\u2019ve got a lead in Michigan. We want to hold on to it, and we think we can do that.\u201d</p> <p>Trump has been widely condemned as a demagogue after calling for a temporary <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/dec/07/donald-trump-ban-all-muslims-entering-us-san-bernardino-shooting\">ban on Muslims entering the US</a> and promising to build a wall on the Mexican border, branding immigrants as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/30/trump-comments-mexico-rapists-planned-deposition-video\">rapists and criminals</a>.

  "<p>My colleague Wamidh Nadhmi, who has died at the age of 75, was an outstanding Iraqi academic and fighter for democracy and justice. A secular advocate of Arab nationalism during its heyday, he performed the rare feat of calling for reforms during the dictatorship of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/dec/30/iraq.guardianobituaries\" title=\"\">Saddam Hussein</a> and, because of his local and international reputation, going unpunished.</p> <p>Unlike many opponents of the Ba\u2019athist regime, he was a determined critic of the US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003. In that year he published the <a href=\"http://www.alfikralarabi.net/vb/showthread.php?t=2686\" title=\"\">Arab Banner</a>, the first newspaper to oppose the occupation, and rejected an invitation to join the Iraqi governing council, which was set up by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/06/iraq-war-aftermath-paul-bremer\" title=\"\">Paul Bremer</a>, the US head of the Coalition Provisional Authority. In 2004 Wamidh helped to establish and was elected vice-president of the Iraqi National Foundation Congress, the first coalition to include politicians and representatives from all walks of Iraqi life who opposed the occupation.</p> <p>Wamidh was born and educated in Baghdad. He studied at the American University of Beirut and Cairo University, but took his first degree in law at Baghdad University in 1964. After military service, he came to Britain to get his PhD from Durham University. Returning home in 1974, he joined Baghdad University\u2019s college of law and politics, where he taught subjects that were unfamiliar in a one-party state, lecturing on Marxism-Leninism and problems of under-development in the Arab world. His publications were always distinctive, meaningful and important. His main book, <a href=\"http://caus.org.lb/Home/index.php\" title=\"\">The Origins of the Nationalist Independence Movements in Iraq</a>, expanded on his PhD thesis.</p> <p>He was a prolific contributor to Arab journals, and in 1987 formed the Arab Association of Political Science, which gathered colleagues from across the Arab world.</p> <p>During the Iraq-Iran war, fearing it might produce sectarian divisions, he published a controversial article entitled The Role of the Iraqi Shiites in the Independence of Modern Iraq. After Saddam\u2019s invasion of Kuwait in 1990 and the war and sanctions that ensued, he formed a group of eight people who called for reforms in Iraq. The president responded positively by publishing their memorandum in a state-owned journal. This encouraged the group to write other memorandums. Although their wish to acquire an independent journal was rejected, Wamidh was content that Iraqis were at last hearing a different view. His other bold initiative was to establish a charity to provide medicines and other humanitarian aid to the increasing number of Iraqis suffering from sanctions.</p> <p>Teaching political science in a balanced way has never been easy in a country such as Iraq. Wamidh belonged to the \u201cgolden generation\u201d of professors, who carried on serving their students even when receiving the equivalent of \u00a313 a month, due to sanctions. He and his like refused to leave Iraq despite tempting offers from abroad. Until his last days he continued to believe in Iraqis\u2019 ability to overcome their difficulties and maintain their country\u2019s integrity.</p> <p>Wamidh is survived by his wife, Suboh Mudalal, two sons, Jamal and Salahuldin, and two daughters, Thura and Qudus.</p>",
  "<p>Douglas Stankewitz and Colleen Hicks are worried about the election.</p> <p> They are seated on mismatched blue plastic chairs in cage PB7, one of the padlocked wire mesh enclosures at San Quentin state prison where condemned men visit with friends and loved ones. They lean into each other, shoulders touching. He puts his arm around her. She strokes his neck.</p> <p> Stankewitz was sentenced to death 38 years ago for the kidnap and murder of Theresa Graybeal, aged 22. He has been on death row since, longer than any inmate in California and all but a few nationwide. His murder conviction was thrown out once. His death sentence, twice. His third sentencing hearing is scheduled for 16 October.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/09/california-death-penalty-propositions-62-66-election\">To kill or not to kill?

Proposition 66 would streamline \u2013 and, perhaps, speed up \u2013 capital punishment in the state with the country\u2019s biggest death row.</p> <p> Both possibilities make the unlikely couple nervous. Hicks, 69, is director of the Museum of the American Indian in the Bay area town of Novato. Stankewitz, 58, is a member of the Mono tribe, goes by the nickname \u201cChief\u201d and has been locked up \u2013 somewhere \u2013 most of his life.</p> <p> They fear that if the death penalty is abolished, Stankewitz\u2019s current legal case could be derailed. Even though the court proceeding scheduled for October 2017 will only address death or life without parole, Stankewitz holds out hope that his new lawyer can get him a new trial and prove that he is innocent.</p> <p> The tall, stocky condemned man, whose black hair cascades to his shoulder blades, is living proof that the death penalty process in California is broken. At age 20, he was the first person to land on San Quentin\u2019s infamous death row after the state put the modern death penalty in place in 1978. Nearly four decades and two reversals later, he is still there.</p> <p> What he wants, he said on a rainy Sunday morning nine days before the election, is \u201cfreedom. It sounds funny. People say, \u2018How do you know? You been locked up so long.\u2019</p> <p> \u201cI\u2019d love to go fishing, too,\u201d Stankewitz said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have to catch nothing. Just fish.\u201d</p> <p> \u201cAnd work in the garden,\u201d said Hicks, who wants him to live with her in Marin County, north of San Francisco, if he is ever freed.</p> <p> \u201cYeah,\u201d Stankewitz said, smiling, \u201clet those gophers know who\u2019s boss.\u201d</p> <p> California has executed 13 men since Stankewitz landed on death row. One hundred and four died of other causes, according to the state corrections and rehabilitation department: 71 of natural causes, 25 from suicide, and eight from what prison officials described as \u201cother\u201d.</p> <p> Today, 750 inmates await execution in San Quentin\u2019s death chamber with a pale green gurney on which inmates are strapped. The oldest is 86; the youngest, 24. California has not put anyone to death since 2006.</p> <p> In phone calls, letters, and an in-person visit, Stankewitz talked about the night Theresa Graybeal died, about the trials that were reversed, about the woman he loves, and about life as a condemned man in California\u2019s oldest prison.</p> <p> \u201cAll the days are the same here,\u201d Stankewitz said. \u201cI try not to think I\u2019m here. It\u2019s worse than an animal, I know that. An animal in a zoo or a dog pound has more space than us \u2026 You\u2019re on death row. You know you\u2019re in prison. You don\u2019t ponder it.\u201d</p> <p> He has lived in 3 E Block 62 for the past seven years. He does not share a cell; no one on death row does. He does not keep a calendar. There is no reason to. He has typed some 15,000 letters asking for help. He watches TV, reads, follows politics, works out.</p> <p>\u201cA lot of guys tell you that \u2018poor me\u2019 stuff,\u201d Stankewitz said. \u201cIt\u2019s unhealthy. They got to fight to get out of the system. Even if you\u2019re innocent, the system don\u2019t care.\u201d<br></p> <p>The few times that there have been executions, he said, the prison was locked down early, and the tense place became even more so. Some of the men who were put to death were his friends, inmates such as Stanley \u201cTookie\u201d Williams, founder of the Crips gang. Williams was convicted of the brutal shotgun murders of four men but became an anti-violence crusader while waiting to die.</p> <p>\u201cEvery day is the possibility to be executed, somehow, some way,\u201d Stankewitz said. The day of an execution \u201cmay be more intense, if you believe it\u2019s wrong to take a life. There\u2019s no more premeditation than this.\u201d</p> <p>Stankewitz has spent about a third of his life in solitary confinement, a place that he says drives a lot of people crazy, pushes them \u201cfrom the prison to a mental hospital\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cBack then, you had nothing in your cell except darkness and a hole in the floor that was your toilet,\u201d he said. \u201cAt 4pm they gave you a mattress and a pillow. Fifteen hundred calories diet a day.\u201d</p> <p> But it was in solitary confinement that Stankewitz met Father Jack O\u2019Neill, the prison chaplain who later became the parish priest at St Mary Magdalene, where Hicks is choir director and plays piano. In 2008, O\u2019Neill asked Hicks if she would consider corresponding with Stankewitz.</p> <p> She said yes. Stankewitz calls Hicks every morning. She visits him on Saturdays and every Sunday after mass.</p> <p> \u201cWe\u2019re a couple now,\u201d Hicks said. \u201cI did not see that coming.\u201d</p> <p> \u201cWe talk about the case a lot,\u201d she added. \u201cI tell him about the museum, just everything. He\u2019s just interested. He says, \u2018I just want to know what you\u2019re doing in that big free world of yours.\u2019\u201d</p> <p> On this Sunday in late October, the guards are late bringing Stankewitz down from his cell to the visiting area. Hicks is dressed in purple. The men, she says, are so color-deprived that she tries not to wear black.</p> <p> She has washed off a brown cafeteria tray and bought lunch from the vending machines. Orange juice for him, water for her. Cheez-Its. Cheesecake. Yoghurt. A pastrami and swiss cheese sandwich. A frozen burrito and a frozen egg sandwich on a muffin that she will microwave.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/oct/21/28-years-on-death-row\">I spent 28 years on death row</a> </p> </aside>  <p> Hicks paces, nervous as a teenager.

They embrace.</p> <p> On 8 February 1978, Stankewitz and three friends were stranded in Modesto. Unable to find a ride back to Fresno, they staked out a Kmart parking lot, followed Graybeal to her vehicle, shoved her in and headed south. In Fresno, they shot up with heroin at a seedy hotel and headed off to score some more in a nearby town called Calwa.</p> <p> \u201cMs. Greybeal was facing away from the car,\u201d court documents said. \u201cDefendant raised the gun in his left hand, braced it with his right hand, and shot her once in the head from a distance of about one foot.\u201d</p> <p> That version of events came from Billy Brown, then 14, who received immunity in exchange for his testimony, later recanted and has since died.

It may yet influence how governments are formed. Recent reports suggest that many of Donald Trump\u2019s most fervent online supporters are not themselves Americans, but Russians being paid by their government to help him win. <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/russian-online-troll-tells-samantha-bee-why-she-prefers-donald-trump_us_58184cafe4b0990edc3340d2\">One told Samantha Bee</a> that she pretends to be a housewife from Nebraska.

In an analysis of 43,800 pro-regime comments, the researchers concluded that 99.3% of them were made by civil servants from a wide variety of government departments. The postings tended to come in bursts at testing times, such as during protests or party meetings.</p> <p>Interestingly, few of the comments qualify as trolling, in the strict sense. Rather than attacking unbelievers, they focus on swamping the doubters with a flood of positive messages, or cleverly diverting the conversation. As with any job, some practitioners are laughably bad at it.

He described creating several identities in one forum, and structuring arguments between them so that the most authoritative voice could ultimately settle matters in the government\u2019s favour. Another tactic was to be deliberately provocative, and thus draw public anger on to himself and away from the authorities. \u201cSometimes I feel like I have a split personality,\u201d he said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say I like it or hate it.

In Hebrew it\u2019s called <a href=\"http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-1.541142\">\u201chasbara\u201d, literally meaning \u201cexplanation\u201d</a>, and it involves trying to improve the world\u2019s opinion of the country and its causes. Accordingly there are around 350 official Israeli online channels, covering the full range of social media. For instance, besides its well-known Twitter accounts in English, Hebrew and Arabic, the Israeli Defence Force <a href=\"https://www.pinterest.com/idfonline/\">even has its own Pinterest page</a>, featuring photo collections with themes such as \u201cSoldiers\u2019 Stories\u201d and \u201cIDF Style\u201d.</p> <p>In 2013, the Israeli government revealed that it would also recruit \u201ccovert units\u201d however. These would be staffed by a mixture of international supporters and domestic students, whose high intelligence, low income and familiarity with social media make them generally well suited to professional trolling. \u201cWe need a unified effort to explain why we have a legal right to be here in Israel,\u201d the <a href=\"http://www.jpost.com/Diplomacy-and-Politics/Government-to-use-citizens-as-army-in-social-media-war-322972\">Knesset member Dov Lipman told the Jerusalem Post</a>. \u201cThat is key to defeat the movements pushing to boycott, divest and sanction Israel.\u201d Those who signed up would get quick access to government information, and leaders of student groups would also be awarded scholarships.</p> <p>Sure enough, during the war in Gaza the following summer, a student group called <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/16/israel-hamas-clash-social-media\">Israel Under Fire</a> emerged as one of many voices promoting the Israeli side of the story. \u201cWe counter Palestinian propaganda and explain the Israeli perspective,\u201d the group\u2019s leader, Yarden Ben-Yosef, said. \u201cSocial media is another place where the war goes on. This is another way to tell our story.\u201d We do not know whether Israel Under Fire was itself one of these covert units, or whether Ben-Yosef got a scholarship.

The i-army.org site itself, where volunteers can join, is certainly <a href=\"https://meduza.io/\">not very appealing to outsiders</a>. It is a crazed and relentless jumble of unflattering stories about Russia \u2013 from details about the MH17 air crash, to doping by its athletes, to unsubstantiated allegations from the western media that Putin is a paedophile. \u201cDo not let yourself be deceived \u2013 spread the truth!\u201d the site says, rousingly.</p> <p>More obvious signs of life can be found on the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/i_army_org\">i-army\u2019s Twitter page</a>. This is very active, with 12,800 followers, which isn\u2019t bad, and retweets regularly runs into dozens or hundreds. Clearly some of its followers have been arguing Ukraine\u2019s case online, but the tweets themselves are not very persuasive, offering photographs of captured Russian military hardware, dry political statements and sudden comic memes about Russia\u2019s federal reserves, for example.</p> <p>The account\u2019s wallpaper perhaps tells you everything you need to know about the Information Policy Ministry \u2013 or the \u201cMinistry of Truth\u201d, as some Ukrainian wags prefer. It depicts a group of noble white knights carrying the ministry\u2019s logo into battle against, literally, an army of fantastical trolls (who rather incongruously carry the logos of RT television and Russia 24). No matter how sympathetic one might feel towards the Ukrainian cause, it is hard not to feel that this particular region of the conflict needs a lighter touch.</p> <p><strong>Estimated troops</strong> A few hundred.</p> <p><strong>Favourite subjects</strong> Russia, Russia, Russia, Russia, Russia.</p> <h2> UK</h2> <p>The so-called \u201cTwitter Troops\u201d of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/jan/31/british-army-facebook-warriors-77th-brigade\">the 77th Brigade</a> were somewhat misunderstood by the media when the new army unit was created last year. In fact social media was just one example of many non-military skills that the specialist soldiers were intended to bring to the army. And in any case, the MoD informs me, it would not be a soldier\u2019s job to launch a disinformation campaign on the battlefield, even if they had the time.</p> <p>You don\u2019t hear much about JTRIG in Britain, however, and they do just this kind of thing. Indeed the very existence of the Joint Threat Research Intelligence Group was a national secret until documents from Edward Snowden were published <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2015/06/22/controversial-gchq-unit-domestic-law-enforcement-propaganda\">by Glenn Greenwald and Andrew Fishman in 2014</a>. And they reveal a very busy group of people, whose work within GCHQ was intended to help everyone from the police and MI5 to the Department for Children, Schools and Families and the Bank of England.</p> <p><a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2014/02/24/jtrig-manipulation/\">Some of JTRIG\u2019s tactics</a>, such as hacking into websites and setting up sexual \u201choneypot\u201d stings, sound more or less like conventional spying. Others were carefully designed to manipulate and deceive. <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/document/2015/06/22/behavioural-science-support-jtrig/\">In the words of the leaked document</a>, these included \u201cUploading YouTube videos containing persuasive messages; establishing online aliases with Facebook and Twitter accounts, blogs and forum memberships \u2026 sending spoof emails and text messages as well as providing spoof online resources; and setting up spoof trade sites.\u201d</p> <p>Some of this sounds reasonable, and frankly welcome, such as disrupting the online activities of terrorists or child abusers. Indeed, if it still exists, JTRIG seems to target specific groups or individuals, rather than trying to influence public opinion. Which groups, however, and who chooses them, might be a legitimate concern. The document mentions the English Defence League, for example, whose members were no doubt not happy to be included.

Domestically, there is thus no online opinion for the regime to bother about controlling. (Unless they <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-36416970\">launch their own version of Facebook</a>, as some <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2013/03/13/a-rare-glimpse-of-north-koreas-version-of-facebook/\">believe they plan to</a>.) Across the border, however, just about all South Koreans have smartphones, KakaoTalk and the fastest internet in the world. They also have <a href=\"http://english.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2013/08/13/2013081300891.html\">about 200 North Korean trolls to contend with</a>, according to a report published by a South Korean think-tank, the Police Policy Institute, in 2013. In total the report estimated that North Korean agents had posted 41,373 pieces of propaganda in 2012. (That\u2019s about one every two days per agent, which is hardly Stakhanovite.)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"ae12b9bde9fa8009aed49a29c0a29076e02257e8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ae12b9bde9fa8009aed49a29c0a29076e02257e8/0_0_2362_3283/719.jpg\" alt=\"Illustration: Joe Magee\" width=\"719\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Illustration: Joe Magee</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Joe Magee</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Given the extreme strangeness of the regime in Pyongyang, it is easy to presume that they would not know how to talk to a sophisticated southern audience. In fact their approach, as revealed in the report, is rather clever. Instead of hammering people with outlandish and unconvincing Juche propaganda in the usual North Korean way, Pyongyang\u2019s trolls focus on areas that are still debated in the south \u2013 such as whether to give southerners access to sites (currently blocked) that praise the northern regime. Aware that recently started accounts with little background often arouse suspicion, northern agents also tend to work behind identities stolen from real southern users.</p> <p>Clearly the problem has been serious enough for South Korea to react, and indeed to overreact. For years the country\u2019s National Intelligence Service has been routinely posting messages of its own to attack those coming from the north, and at times these have allegedly <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/15/world/asia/south-korean-agents-accused-of-tarring-opposition-before-election.html?_r=0\">strayed into attacks on South Korea\u2019s own opposition parties</a>. Last year the country\u2019s former intelligence chief Won Sei-hoon was convicted of trying to influence the outcome of the 2012 presidential election in favour of the incumbent Park Geun-hye. A retrial has since been ordered, but in the original Won was alleged to be running a team of nine agents who used at least 658 Twitter identities to post many thousands of messages to discredit the north \u2013 and also, in the case of 274,800 messages, <a href=\"https://revolution-news.com/south-korea-50k-protest-national-intelligence-service-election-rigging\">to smear President Park\u2019s opponents</a>, who were described as, among other things, \u201cleftist followers of North Korea\u201d.</p> <p><strong>Estimated troops</strong> 200 (north) 9 (south).</p> <p><strong>Favourite subject</strong> Whether North Korea is a) paradise b) paranoid.</p> <h2> Turkey</h2> <p>President Erdo\u011fan was taught a lesson by the Gezi Park protests of 2013. Not, unfortunately, that Turks should be allowed to live more freely, but that he should take control of social media, with which they had organised themselves against him. By the end of the summer, the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) had begun recruiting <a href=\"http://www.dailysabah.com/elections/2015/05/11/ak-party-founded-new-turkey-digital-office-for-the-general-elections-on-june-7\">a team of 6,000 social media operatives</a>. \u201cWe aim at developing a positive political language which we are teaching to our volunteers,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887323527004579079151479634742\">a party official told the Wall Street Journal at the time</a>. \u201cAnd when the opposing camp spreads disinformation about the party, we correct them with valid information, always using positive language.\u201d But not always being open about it. When asked to name some of the people who would be correcting this misinformation, the official declined.</p> <p>Sadly for Erdo\u011fan and the AKP, <a href=\"http://www.dailydot.com/politics/turkey-twitter-trolls/\">their new army of volunteers proved overenthusiastic and, let\u2019s say, under-subtle</a>. In the months that followed it became common for those who even mildly criticised the government to be <a href=\"http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2015/09/turkey-elections-akp-mulls-dumping-social-media-trolls.html#\">showered with far from positive remarks</a>. Often the abuse arrived in bursts, from people with not very convincing profiles, making accusations that were not only bizarre but bizarrely similar. For instance when the journalist <a href=\"http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2013/11/akp-social-media-twitter-facebook.html\">Emre Kizilkaya criticised the government\u2019s handling of a hostage negotiation</a> in October, he found himself repeatedly accused of \u201cZionism\u201d.</p> <p>At times the \u201cAK Trolls\u201d, as they became known, spread false stories. In July 2014, it was reported that they started a fake Twitter account supposedly from the musician Erkan Ogur, used it to tweet controversial comments about the state intelligence services, then complained about \u201chis\u201d tweets to the AKP authorities in Sakarya, who promptly cancelled Ogur\u2019s forthcoming concert there. Later, Erdo\u011fan\u2019s own daughter Sumeyye was apparently recorded asking one of his advisers for help from \u201cour trolls\u201d. When recordings allegedly showing Erdo\u011fan\u2019s own corruption began to spread on Twitter in the spring of 2014, he simply (but not very effectively) shut Twitter down.</p> <p>Perhaps aware that this Putinesque farce wasn\u2019t making the AKP more popular, the party changed tack just before the general elections last spring, launching the <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/turkish-president-s-social-media-campaigners-deny-being-a-troll-army-10301599.html\">New Turkey Digital Office</a>, which would henceforth dish out more conventional online propaganda. \u201cAll of our accounts will be officially announced,\u201d spokesman Besir Atalay told the Turkish media. \u201cOur messages will be determined at the party headquarters.

The main event was around a backyard swimming pool under a fickle summer sky. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/gallery/2016/nov/02/a-z-of-trump-26-illustrators-picture-a-ghastly-future-in-pictures\">A-Z of Trump: 26 illustrators imagine a 'ghastly' future \u2013\u00a0in pictures</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The family hosting the presidential candidate had a 22-year-old son who was a Trump superfan. He had somehow coaxed the candidate to appear at the backyard event. Before the speech, there would be a reception for invited guests with hors d\u2019oeuvres stacked on the family\u2019s dining room table. But this was for invited guests only. Reporters, let alone more plebeian Trump supporters, were not permitted to partake. </p> <p>Otherwise, there were no press pens as reporters stood intermingled in the crowd with ardent Tea Partiers and curious onlookers there to see a television celebrity who had somehow ended up in Bedford, New Hampshire, for the evening.</p> <p>Trump delivered a long, winding monologue of the sort that would later become his trademark as he veered from dire warnings about illegal immigrants to praise for executives at Comcast and an extended and impassioned anecdote about how professional politicians couldn\u2019t recognize low-quality highway guardrails.</p> <p>The event, with more than 200 people was one of the rare times that Trump attempted anything approaching traditional retail politics. As he soared in the polls, Trump became a phenomenon who packed arenas and stadiums across much of the south. By September 2015, even the gesture of a retail stop at a tailgate outside an Iowa v Iowa State football game turned into a mob scene. The candidate was swarmed by people chanting his name and reaching out to somehow touch him as a pack of bodyguards protected Trump from getting too close to the masses outside the stadium.</p> <p>It was during this period that the Guardian interviewed Trump in a New Hampshire hotel conference room after he had addressed a non-partisan event designed to focus on \u201cproblem solving\u201d. He was gracious and soft-spoken if vague on policy detail. He broadly endorsed several progressive priorities like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2015/oct/13/donald-trump-police-body-cameras-video\">federal funding for police body cameras</a> and rail transit while striking his typical isolationist notes on foreign policy. The interview was filmed and it was noteworthy how keenly aware he was of the camera and how carefully he positioned himself for it. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2015/oct/13/donald-trump-putin-assad-humanitarian-foreign-policy-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/4d8yz\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2388066\"            data-video-name=\"Donald Trump talks to the Guardian about Syria and his worldview \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"The Guardian\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-561c4e15e4b0fed5dcd57348\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2015/10/13/20101012TRUMPFOREIGNPOLICY_FromGuAmRM-16x9.mp4\"/><source src=\"http://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=10872835&amp;format=video/3gp&amp;maxwidth=700\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2015/10/13/20101012TRUMPFOREIGNPOLICY_FromGuAmRM/20101012TRUMPFOREIGNPOLICY_FromGuAmRM.m3u8\"/><source src=\"http://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=10872835&amp;format=video/3gp&amp;minwidth=700\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2015/10/13/20101012TRUMPFOREIGNPOLICY_FromGuAmRM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2015/oct/13/donald-trump-putin-assad-humanitarian-foreign-policy-video\">Ben Jacobs interviews Donald Trump in October 2015</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Instead, Trump became a candidate of big venues and big speeches. Once or twice a day in high school gyms or a convention center in Iowa or New Hampshire, the Republican nominee would put on his show. By the autumn of 2015, Trump had acquired secret service protection and all the other accoutrements of a general election candidate, despite the fact that he was a political novice who had never appeared on a ballot. Reporters were caged in a press pen, unable to freely roam and mingle with voters once the nominee was in the vicinity. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4770e9233e6284dba23b775f979df83acbaace39\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4770e9233e6284dba23b775f979df83acbaace39/0_57_2500_1501/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Trump supporters jeer at protesters during a campaign rally in Burlington, Vermont, on 7 January.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Trump supporters jeer at protesters during a campaign rally in Burlington, Vermont, on 7 January.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Erin Siegal/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>His campaign stops became must-see events, especially in states where visits from presidential candidates were rarities. Trump rallies seemed to resemble rock concerts more than anything previously seen in presidential politics. In a January 2016 rally in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jan/08/donald-trump-burlington-vermont-bernie-sanders-home-turf\">Bernie Sanders heartland of Burlington, Vermont,</a> lines stretched for blocks in the bitter cold as thousands of people congregated to see Trump in a downtown theater. Many were taking their minds off the weather by drinking steadily as they waited and the street was soon littered with empty beer cans. </p> <p>The atmosphere was just as unusual inside the Trump rallies. The Republican candidate\u2019s events became ground zero for protests over a variety of issues, ranging from his vehement anti-immigrant rhetoric to his advocacy of a ban on Muslims entering the United States. In Burlington, a liberal college town, Trump staffers were eagle-eyed at the door, requiring attendees to take loyalty pledges to enter. That wasn\u2019t enough to stop the event from being repeatedly interrupted, with the candidate urging: \u201cTake him out. Get him out of here. Don\u2019t give him his coat!\u201d as one heckler was ejected. </p> <p>Repeated disruptions became routine, along with actual outbreaks of violence. The disturbing trend culminated in a cancelled rally in Chicago, which descended into chaos. The candidate didn\u2019t take the stage as the venue in the heart of deep Democratic blue, ethnically diverse Chicago was filled with protesters. When the announcement came that Trump was not taking the stage, fights quickly broke out throughout the arena. Such scenes of political violence had not been seen in decades in the United States.</p> <p>The next day, Trump\u2019s rally in Cleveland had about a dozen interruptions from protesters, something which would have been astonishing had it happened in any other year to any other candidate. Instead, there was no violence and no attempt by Trump to encourage violence and it just seemed like the new normal as he sneered at those who were escorted out, claiming that they were sent by \u201cour communist friend\u201d, Bernie Sanders.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"74deab6dfdee962f34212028ceb834ba8ec4863f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/74deab6dfdee962f34212028ceb834ba8ec4863f/0_233_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Donald Trump holds forth in Miami, Florida.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Donald Trump holds forth in Miami.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Carlo Allegri/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But it wasn\u2019t just the crowds at Trump\u2019s events, which were unusual. It was the candidate\u2019s rhetoric. On a daily basis, Trump made statements that were just astonishing by any traditional standard, comparing a rival to a child molester, or linking another\u2019s father to a plot to kill President Kennedy. In the course of a single day on the campaign trail in South Carolina, Trump both <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/18/donald-trump-pope-francis-christian-wall-mexico-border\">attacked the pope</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/19/trump-appears-to-endorse-executing-terrorists-citing-questionable-history\">accused</a> one of the most decorated American soldiers in history of committing war crimes. The statements had no effect on his standing in the polls and he won a commanding victory only a few days later in the South Carolina primary. </p> <p>Trump finally clinched the Republican nomination in early May when Ted Cruz dropped out after the Indiana primary. His next event was a raucous rally in a grim brutalist arena in Charleston, West Virginia. It had been scheduled in advance of the state\u2019s primary. Hours before it started, the crowd outside formed a disorderly horde in red and white Make America Great Again hats. Once Trump finally took the stage in the dank 60s-era construction in the dilapidated downtown, he strutted about the stage triumphantly, suggesting to attendees that they didn\u2019t need to bother to vote in the primary any more as he boasted about his abiding love and affection for coal and coalminers.</p> <p>In the weeks that followed, there was no pivot to a general election. Instead, Trump seemed nostalgic for the intra-Republican contest as he travelled the length of California in advance of the state\u2019s June primary, as well as taking a bizarre trip to Scotland to see his golf course in the aftermath of the Brexit referendum. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"38a80d8bb302532b77a4f7c25bdc0b5fb18b29cb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/38a80d8bb302532b77a4f7c25bdc0b5fb18b29cb/17_0_3884_2331/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Donald Trump at the Republican national convention in Cleveland\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Donald Trump at the Republican national convention in Cleveland: a grim, depressing slog.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Patrick Semansky/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When Trump officially became the nominee in July, it was at a convention in Cleveland that was more banal than anyone could have imagined. Although Trump had promised star-studded festivities and there were fears that protests in the surrounding streets would rival the dramatic scenes outside the 1968 Democratic convention in Chicago, it was instead a grim, depressing slog. </p> <p>In lieu of celebrities, there was former Happy Days actor Scott Baio and, instead of graceful concession speeches, former rival Ted Cruz urged Republicans to \u201cvote their conscience\u201d in what was widely viewed as a snub to Trump. Much of the effort seemed to be focused on stopping anti-Trump rebels from forcing any vote or coming close to any open display of dissatisfaction. No one had any illusions that Trump could somehow be thwarted. </p> <p>The nomination was secured after more than a week of grinding procedural warfare replete with the type of tactical chicanery that one would have expected from smoke- not iPhone-filled rooms. Anti-Trump petitions mysteriously disappeared, wavering delegates were subjected to intense pressure and every available scrap of procedure was put to good use. For a moment, he was just like any other candidate overseeing a political organization.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"1cade843148294df123422a9b0da647847a1ccf1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1cade843148294df123422a9b0da647847a1ccf1/0_0_2203_1322/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Steve Bannon, Trump\u2019s campaign CEO, attends a rally in Eau Claire, Wisconsin.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Steve Bannon, Trump\u2019s campaign CEO and Breitbart editor, attends a rally in Eau Claire, Wisconsin.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Paul Manafort, the shadowy veteran campaign aide who had finally elbowed out Trump\u2019s longtime campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, after an intense turf war, oversaw all of these efforts. For his reward, he was unceremoniously fired less than a month later after growing reports of his ties to Russia and acrimony within the highest ranks of the Trump campaign.</p> <p>At that point, the campaign came under the control of Steve Bannon, the editor of the rightwing site Breitbart. Working in concert with veteran GOP pollster Kellyanne Conway, Trump abandoned his unscripted rallies and began using a teleprompter exclusively. He also hunkered down, avoiding the media outside of deeply conservative talk radio and Fox News.</p> <p>In personal unguarded interactions, Trump was genial with the press. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/11/donald-trump-campaign-ohio-fair-plane-media\">When the Guardian accompanied him on his personal plane</a> in September as a pool reporter, he chatted freely with handful of journalists who accompanied him and went out of his way to be gracious. But these were few and far between as the Republican nominee became increasingly distant outside of his rallies and his omnipresent Twitter account. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"219f063f3342891f35dbf0b2ec5e8b0817e87e5e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/219f063f3342891f35dbf0b2ec5e8b0817e87e5e/0_132_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ben Jacobs (left) with Mike Pence and Donald Trump aboard Trump\u2019s plane as they travel between campaign stops in Ohio in September.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ben Jacobs (left) with Mike Pence and Donald Trump aboard Trump\u2019s plane as they travel between campaign stops in Ohio in September.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mike Segar/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The rallies began to take on darker tones. There was no more open violence or unruliness. Protesters had become rare. Instead, they became venues for Trump to share his rage over the \u201crigged system\u201d and stir up an angry crowd \u2013 against the media, against Hillary Clinton, against \u201cglobalists\u201d and a host of other villains.</p> <p>Attendees showed up in bitter T-shirts proclaiming that they were \u201cdeplorable\u201d and took up Trump\u2019s invitation to deride reporters.</p> <p>At one rally in Cincinnati in October, the traveling press was booed by a crowd of roughly 15,000 as it entered the arena. </p> <p>Trump had stopped trying to be a normal candidate but he was no longer being Trump. It was a dark hybrid. He had lost much of the freewheeling joie de vivre that had taken him to strange, albeit controversial places. Instead, he had become a relatively coherent figure, articulating a clear world view \u2013 but one that was deeply paranoid and out of the mainstream, where the press was no longer a stalking horse but simply the enemy.<br></p>",

  "<p>Last week, the US supreme court announced it will hear the transgender bathroom rights case, GG v Gloucester County School Board. Gavin Grimm, a trans senior at Gloucester high school in Virginia, is fighting for his right to use the boys\u2019 bathroom at school, and the school district is appealing to the highest court in the country to keep him out. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2016/oct/28/transgender-bathroom-virginia-supreme-court-gavin-grimm\">US supreme court to rule if transgender teen can use boys' bathroom</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A ruling is unlikely before Gavin\u2019s graduation, and he will continue to face crippling discrimination every day of what should be his celebratory senior year. </p> <p>But the impending ruling has effects beyond Gavin. Parents of transgender children across the nation are holding our collective breath, because our children\u2019s safety and dignity are at stake, too. </p> <p>The Scotus announcement lands amid continued outrage surrounding North Carolina\u2019s now infamous HB2 law, prohibiting transgender people from accessing the facilities appropriate to their gender identity all in the name of \u201cprotecting women and children\u201d. </p> <p>Let\u2019s talk about privacy, since those who oppose transgender bathroom rights are so fixated on its protection. As middle school girls, many of us were so insecure about our bodies that we were mortified by the idea of changing openly. Personally, I don\u2019t remember looking at anyone\u2019s bodies. Singling out our transgender daughters as a threat to the other girls\u2019 privacy simply based on their genitalia is sexualizing them, plain and simple.</p> <p>Every bathroom controversy is a direct hit to our children. In particular, the argument against transgender rights in the name of protecting female spaces is \u2013 as the mothers of transgender daughters \u2013 what threatens our hard-fought progress combating dangerous anti-trans legislation. It also undermines our even harder-fought progress teaching our girls, transgender and cisgender alike, that they are valued members of society, and legitimate shades of womanhood.</p> <p>We all want to safeguard our children, and some of us have cisgender (that is, not transgender) daughters and sons as well as transgender children. But when it comes to our daughters\u2019 safety, we, the mothers and co-signers of this piece, are far more wary of men emboldened by a generalized epidemic of misogyny and permissive rape culture than we are of the transgender women who are just trying to live an authentic life with dignity.</p> <p> Transgender women themselves \u2013 particularly trans women of color \u2013 are marginalized and singled out as victims of brutal violence at a staggering rate. In 2016 to date, 23 transgender women were <a href=\"http://www.advocate.com/transgender/2016/10/14/cleveland-trans-womans-death-ruled-homicide-23rd-us-year\">murdered</a> in the United States, nearly all women of color, most of them black. There is no question that transphobia coupled with racism is a lethal combination. </p> <p>Several of us have transgender daughters who are brown, black or biracial. The clear and present danger for these girls as they develop into young trans women is chilling. As long as we perpetuate the unsubstantiated threat of trans people in intimate spaces, our vulnerable trans youth will continue to be viewed as the monsters under the bed. </p> <p>My own daughters are young enough to bathe together. They are sisters. I imagine in the locker room, all of our trans girls will view their friends as most girls do: like sisters, genitalia aside. Some radical feminist groups would say that our trans daughters\u2019 membership to the sacred sisterhood is empirically denied, simply because of their anatomy. They are effectively reducing women to our genitalia. That sounds more like a Trumped-up brand of feminism than the real thing, if you ask me. </p> <p>Fringe groups may play the heavyweights, funding anti-LGBTQ legislation across the country, but their special breed of transphobic evangelism must not be representative of who we are as a nation. Transgender activist and actress Laverne Cox of Orange Is the New Black famously said that \u201cloving transgender people is a radical act\u201d. In America, countless thousands of families across religions, races and political views are engaging in that very radical act of loving and advocating for our transgender children every day.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Gavin Grimm is a young man, regardless of what is between his legs. Our daughters are girls, regardless of what is between theirs. Like Gavin \u2013 like all trans people \u2013 our children are merely fighting to use the bathroom they feel is the safest, and most appropriate, without fear or shame.</p> <p><em>The following parents of transgender girls,</em><em> aged 5-16, from 13 different states, c</em><em>o-sign this piece: Chelsa Morrison, Amy Adams, Karen Dolan, Michelle Honda-Phillips, Jeanette Jennings, Vanessa Ford, Nancy Dawson, Debi Jackson, Zoila Fajardo, DeShanna Neal, Rachel Gonzales, Sandra Collins, Ashley Nurkin, Jamie Bruesehoff and Hannah Edwards</em></p>",

From my days in the East German archives reading about documents about the <em>Volksfeind</em> (applied in the 1950s to pretty much anyone who disagreed with the dimwitted Stalinist leader Walter Ulbricht), it\u2019s awfully familiar.</p> <p>Germans already knew it from the Nazi lexicon. It was popularised by a Karl Astel, a National Socialist university rector who declared tobacco an \u201cenemy of the people\u201d, when not otherwise busy on the racialist eugenics programme and trying to set up an SS university. You cannot keep a good bad phrase down.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/nov/04/enemies-of-the-people-british-newspapers-react-judges-brexit-ruling\">British newspapers react to judges' Brexit ruling: 'Enemies of the people'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In a democratic culture, the way we communicate our political battles is heated when contentious subjects are in play. Yet language, in such circumstances, is not just the funnel of arguments. It has its own momentum and impact, deepening divides and replacing the instinct of moderation and compromise with the assumption that anyone who disagrees with the speaker must be an idiot or traitor.</p> <p>I say all this not as a Brexit wound-licker, hoping the lofty men in wigs will magically unravel the result of a referendum. Legal language often hides its own self-importance behind big words. Brexit, the ruling claims, is \u201cjusticiable\u201d, which is a fancy way of judges deciding that it is fine for them to rule on the triggering of a policy decision taken by the prime minister about the exit mechanism from the EU.</p> <p>Increasingly, from press freedom to the PM\u2019s day job, there is little judges don\u2019t feel is their duty to rule on. That presents a serious risk of the balance of power tipping too much to the courts, which do not, as their backers in this case claim, just \u201cuphold\u201d law, but re-interpret it with a view to challenge or changing a political decision.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"78fe1d3880847e05bdaa9a91e57f4db1a04fb845\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/78fe1d3880847e05bdaa9a91e57f4db1a04fb845/0_146_5111_3066/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Adam James (Hovstad) and Hugh Bonneville (Dr Tomas Stockmann) in Chichester Festival theatre\u2019s production of Ibsen\u2019s An Enemy of the People earlier this year.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Adam James (Hovstad) and Hugh Bonneville (Dr Tomas Stockmann) in Chichester Festival theatre\u2019s production of Ibsen\u2019s An Enemy of the People earlier this year.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Many progressives support this, in the high court\u2019s recent example, because the change happens to suit their own wishes. But when a democratic vote has taken place with high participation, there is a question mark over using the courts to throw sands in the wheels of what follows.</p> <p>So we should expect this to be hard fought on both sides. And that is exactly the time at which language needs to be tempered, namely, when we feel least like being temperate. Alas, a particularly fractious zeitgeist is our backdrop. Exhibit A, as we contemplate the US election, is Donald Trump\u2019s crass demagoguery and hokey claim to an \u201cauthentic\u201d people-speak, concealing a nihilistic prospectus for power.</p> <p>It is, however, glib to fault only the rhetoric of those we dislike. Look, too, to the kind of language used by those who would proudly disparage Trump and the Brexiters \u2013 and accord a too comfortable moral equivalence. It\u2019s so easy to arrive at a point where a set menu of phrases shows that we have stopped thinking about the alternative position at all. So as soon as someone starts a sneery conversation featuring air quotes around the \u201c\u00a3350m for the NHS\u201d claim in the referendum campaign, and around \u201cexperts\u201d and \u201ccontrol\u201d, I know that they have probably not given much thought as to what drove the Brexit vote and why these arguments prevailed over their own.</p> <p>Just as surely, we know that the words \u201cmigrants\u201d and \u201cbreaking point\u201d were intentioned to alarm voters and quell arguments about the balancing benefits of immigration.</p> <p>Whingeing or listening back to an echo chamber of the like-minded will not address this. Liberals have not done a good job. On both sides of the Atlantic, they slip into a reactive language of being \u201cterrified\u201d or declaring political events \u201ccatastrophic\u201d, when they mean that they are troublesome, difficult or just not to their taste.

A fair point. But the question of where to draw the line \u2013 and how to do so will decide whether we make things worse or better. Overdo it and liberals come across as pearl-clutching hysterics loath to be challenged. Without doubt, that was one of the traits and tonal inadequacies that let down the Remain camp\u2019s arguments. Do we go down the road suggested by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/01/alastair-campbell-new-labour-tony-blair-immigration-brexit\">Alastair Campbell, formerly New Labour bruiser</a>, last week suggesting that the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/campbellclaret?lang=en-gb\"><em>Mail</em>\u2019s editor</a> be arraigned for incitement to hatred? Old feuds, new battles.</p> <p>Yet more windy threats are unlikely to clear poison from the air and a lot more likely to stoke the next round of hostilities. We could easily run around for the next few years, trading aggressions and caging every unwelcome thought as an \u201cincitement\u201d to something or other. My right to speak out is your micro-aggression. Down the plughole, meanwhile, goes the culture of debate, a British asset better valued in the rest of the world than at home right now. So on Brexit and beyond, let\u2019s speak plainly but courteously across the lines.

  "<p>At Sky\u2019s sprawling campus near Heathrow, Sky News\u2019s energetic chief, John Ryley, is beaming as he proudly points to the channel\u2019s new \u201cglass box\u201d studio, which juts out into thin air a storey above the open-plan ground-floor atrium.</p> <p>\u201cWe are making the biggest investment since Sky News began in 1989,\u201d he says. \u201cAt a time when certain observers say the future of live rolling news is moribund and dead, the glass box is a very good illustration of Sky challenging the status quo. It is a manifestation of the future of non-stop journalism. A very good physical embodiment of what we are about\u201d. </p> <p>The custom-built studio also provides a symbol of the contrast in fortunes between Ryley\u2019s news empire, which he has run for 11 years, and his former employers at the BBC. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/oct/30/martin-baron-we-took-donald-trump-seriously-from-the-beginning\">Martin Baron: 'We took Donald Trump seriously from the beginning'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Until July, when director general Tony Hall guaranteed its future, speculation had been rife that the BBC News channel might be axed or merged with the BBC World News channel to help find the hundreds of millions in savings the BBC is being forced to make over the next few years.<br></p> <p>Does Ryley think his counterpart at the BBC, the head of news James Harding, should have axed the news channel to help find his division\u2019s \u00a380m share of the savings?<br></p> <p>\u201cI think competition is good so I\u2019m pleased we have a competitor,\u201d says Ryley, after a significant pause. \u201cDaily journalism can be a very tough business. I do feel if I\u2019m honest that over the last 18 months that the BBC News channel has lost a bit of its life and vitality. But they\u2019ve made a decision that they are putting their editorial focus into their jewels, the [BBC Radio 4] Today programme and the BBC Ten O\u2019Clock News.\u201d<br></p> <p>He can\u2019t help adding one more dig at Auntie, where he began his career as a graduate trainee in the late 1980s, saying he felt the Today programme was a \u201clittle slow on the uptake\u201d on the airport attack in Brussels this year.<br></p> <p>\u201cWe were lucky, we had our correspondent Alex Rossi at the airport at the time which gave us a distinct advantage,\u201d he concedes, before adding: \u201cThe BBC has fantastic journalists but they have to cut their costs accordingly.\u201d<br></p> <p>Sky has made its own job cuts, with a number of senior journalists and on-screen presenters leaving, including Sunrise\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/oct/13/eamonn-holmes-cut-off-mid-sentence-sky-news-sunrise-farewell\">Eamonn Holmes</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/jul/04/sky-news-anchors-leave-shipandrew-wilson-lorna-dunkley-samantha-simmond\">Andrew Wilson</a>, Lorna Dunkley, Samantha Simmonds and Jeremy Thompson, who retired saying it was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/sep/06/sky-newss-john-thompson-to-retire-to-make-space-for-young-talent\">time to make space for \u201cyoung talent\u201d</a>.</p> <p>Is there a hint of ageism creeping into a Sky which, like most media organisations, is looking at a younger, cheaper, digital future?<br></p> <p>\u201cWe have to sometimes as leaders of news organisations make tough choices [about] where we invest our money,\u201d Ryley says. \u201cThe quality of our journalism is really important and I\u2019ve decided to invest our money in specialist journalists. We are not at all ageist.\u201d<br></p> <p>He points to the likes of Dermot Murnaghan, Adam Boulton and Kay Burley who are \u201cabout\u201d his age (54) or older.<br></p> <p>So would he be interested in Mark Austin (58), who after 30 years is leaving ITV News, where Ryley worked prior to joining Sky in the mid-1990s? </p> <p>Avoiding any direct comment on Austin\u2019s departure, let alone the possibility of getting him on board, Ryley cagily keeps his options open: \u201cWe are always on the lookout for bright talent, young or old.\u201d<br></p> <p>He thinks recent changes at ITV News, which began a little over a year ago with Tom Bradby\u2019s elevation to News at Ten anchor, were needed given Sky has become what he believes is the \u201csecond biggest newsbrand in the UK\u201d over the past 10 years.<br></p> <p>\u201cI quite admired ITN and the News at Ten team at ITV for trying to do something different,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I think Tom Bradby and his people tried to do things differently and therefore I applaud it.\u201d<br></p> <p>A visit to see the glass box is an interesting experience. It puts you in the position of an observer of those working on floors above and below, yet also exposes those within to the outside world, much like a fish in an aquarium. <br></p> <p>During breaks, presenters and visitors need to be wary of the occasional low-orbit loops of the cameras that circle the set from above. One presenter jokes that the steel frames holding the cameras could do with rubber protectors.<br></p> <p>Ryley characterises the creation of the new studio as part of a wider \u201creinvention\u201d of Sky News which also includes \u201cgetting our act together with apps and our mobile approach\u201d.<br></p> <p>\u201cThe only way to achieve longevity is to go through renewal,\u201d he says. \u201cTen to 15 years ago people would have thought of Sky News as purely and only a breaking news service with big red straps across the bottom of the TV. Nowadays I feel you need to do much more than that. The TV news channel is the backbone, the production core, that generates content for all the different outlets, whether it be mobile, supply to commercial radio or Snapchat.\u201d<br></p> <p>Ryley says people were at first \u201csneery\u201d of Sky\u2019s push on to Snapchat, but it has become a \u201cserious place\u201d for news in terms of numbers \u2013 3 million people accessed Sky content on Snapchat Discover on the morning of the Brexit vote.<br></p> <p>He says that by the end of this year Sky will have achieved 1bn views on social media, and on mobile weekly viewing is 5.1m, up 18% year on year.<br></p> <p>When pressed, he admits that like most publishers a relationship with web giants such as Facebook can be a two-edged sword, an attractive distribution platform but with questionable revenue returns.<br></p> <p>For example, he says Sky supplies Facebook Live content three times a day but it is \u201cearly days\u201d on how much revenue will come of it.<br></p> <p>\u201cI think it has yet to play out,\u201d he says. \u201cWe along with other news organisations will need to take a hard think about it.\u201d<br></p> <p>He also comes armed with a bit of news. Sky News has found a new studio to service the City after it was forced out of London\u2019s Gherkin this year. <br></p> <p>The operation, home to the weekday evening business show Ian King Live, was moved to Sky\u2019s Westminster location at Millbank Studios, which some observed might make it trickier to attract some City guests.<br></p> <p>Sky has struck a deal with none other than News Corporation, controlled by Rupert Murdoch (who through Fox is Sky\u2019s biggest shareholder), to set up a full studio in the so-called \u201cBaby Shard\u201d.<br></p> <p>Ryley says that despite the landlord being family \u2013 the building is home to the Times, Sunday Times, the Sun and Dow Jones \u2013 Sky paid \u201cpretty good money to get in there\u201d.<br></p> <p>The proximity to the Murdoch-owned news organisations brings us to one of the big questions hanging over the long-term future of Sky News. Before Fox was forced to give up on its attempt to take full control in 2011, plans had been hatched to spin-off the loss-making channel to address concerns about media plurality</p> <p>Does Ryley worry about what happens if rumours of Fox mounting another takeover bid for Sky turn out to be true?</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m an optimist,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t worry about the future of Sky News. Sky and Fox have a very strong history of investing in news. Rupert Murdoch has invested in journalism at the Times for a very long time, and invested in journalism at Sky.

  "<p>The restaurant at the new <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/13/trump-international-hotel-washington-opening-protests\">Trump International Hotel</a> in Washington wasn\u2019t empty on Thursday night. But it wasn\u2019t full either. The handful of diners could look down on the marbled lobby and bar and see four TVs: two tuned to American football, one to basketball and a fourth to conservative Fox News \u2013 including election ads for the final days of Donald Trump\u2019s presidential campaign.</p> <p>\u201cThe style is jubilant,\u201d said <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dominicvorvlaw1\">Dominic Vorv</a>, 50, a lawyer with a cowboy hat who dined on ribeye steak as banal pop music wafted through the former post office. \u201cMy clients are impressed. My voice does not reverberate here because it\u2019s a large place. You can talk and no one listens to your business to find out: are you a Republican, are you a Democrat?\u201d</p> <p><a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/26/donald-trump-opens-international-hotel-campaign-trail-brand\">The glitzy hotel</a> on Pennsylvania Avenue stands 723 short steps from the White House. Vorv, a Latino from New Mexico who says his legal clients include strippers, hopes that Trump will add the Oval Office to his portfolio on Tuesday. \u201cThe city has been waiting for a leader,\u201d he said. \u201cAll we get is politicians.\u201d</p> <p>Washington has been home to every US president since <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/1600/presidents/johnadams\">John Adams</a>, the second president, in 1800. He and his successors have variously embraced the city or seldom ventured beyond the mansion grounds. George W Bush was rarely seen out at night, whereas Barack Obama has helped DC unbutton its collar. So how would Trump or Hillary Clinton fit in?</p> <p>Politically, at least, one would feel right at home while the other would be a square peg in a round hole. Nine in 10 residents of the District of Columbia <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/2012-election/results/president/district-of-columbia/\">vote Democratic</a>. \u201cTrump would be at war with the city and the population of the city,\u201d said one party stalwart, who did not wish to be named. \u201cThis would be an occupied capital. People in Washington would be regarded as Parisians under the Nazis, with fewer collaborators.\u201d</p> <p>Culturally, it is less certain how Washington would reflect the personality of either would-be commander-in-chief. The brash New York businessman\u2019s travelling circus of celebrity, braggadocio and vulgarity would not be likely to impress the capital\u2019s liberal intellectuals, and Trump\u2019s aesthetic taste clashes with the city\u2019s austere marble and concrete. Even his $212m hotel, with its share of chandeliers and gold leaf, is relatively toned down from the faux Versailles aspirations of his properties in Florida and New York.</p> <p>Nor would Trump find similarities between his voters and the city\u2019s demographics: almost half the population of Washington is African American, part of a group that has <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/07/13/new-polls-in-pennsylvania-and-ohio-show-donald-trump-with-0-percent-of-the-black-vote/\">for months</a> rejected him.

He likes the crowds. If he\u2019s in a restaurant, he\u2019d want to be the centre of attention. With Trump, not only would you have glitz but what put him on the map, as well as being a real estate developer, was being a TV star. He\u2019s an entertainer and there would be showmanship. With Ronald Reagan, it was like he was playing a film role; with Trump, it would be his biggest role yet.\u201d</p> <p>But the real stars, Kendall believes, would be Clinton\u2019s daughter Chelsea, 36, or Trump\u2019s daughter Ivanka, 35.

Most of that has to do with terrible decisions made pre-campaign, but a lot has to do with her instincts. She\u2019s nervous so prepping more and performing better. Got to do something to pump up excitement but not certain how to do that.\u201d</p> <p>Tanden assented: \u201cAlmost no one knows better [than] me that her instincts can be terrible.\u201d</p> <p>When the seemingly innocuous leftwing senator Bernie Sanders came out of nowhere to challenge Clinton in the Democratic primary, there were fears of a repeat of her shock defeat by Obama in 2008. Tanden warned Podesta against attacking Sanders too aggressively.</p> <p>\u201cJust game out what that does to Hillary,\u201d <a href=\"https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/3193\">she wrote in August last year.</a> \u201cWhen we went after Obama, she got killed for it. Reaffirmed all her negatives, strengthened him. We had no idea it was kryptonite for us to do that, but it was. I don\u2019t know if it was Obama or Hillary (I suspected Hillary), but it\u2019s really something to focus group beforehand.\u201d</p> <p>In December, when Tanden wrote in praise of the Paris climate deal, <a href=\"https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/35133\">Podesta responded:</a> \u201cCan you believe that doofus Bernie attacked it?\u201d</p> <p>Then, in March this year, Clinton strategist <a href=\"https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/33579\">Minyon Moore opined:</a> \u201cI think Sanders is a rule breaker and has no institutional loyalty to the Democratic Party; we should expect him to ignore the rules and persist in his quest to flip superdelegates despite overwhelming evidence that reflects his considerable weaknesses with the Democratic base and no doubt in the general.\u201d</p> <p>Tanden, meanwhile, pulled no punches when Clinton\u2019s campaign hesitated over whether to condemn Democratic activist David Brock for demanding Sanders\u2019 medical records. She wrote: \u201cHillary. God. Her instincts are suboptimal.\u201d</p> <p>A stout defender of Clinton in public, in private Tanden injects some bracing honesty that suggests the candidate is not surrounded by sycophants. After the former first lady described herself as a moderate, <a href=\"https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/41455\">Tanden asked of Podesta:</a> \u201cWhy did she call herself a moderate?\u201d</p> <p>He wrote back: \u201cI pushed her on this on Sunday night. She claims she didn\u2019t remember saying it. Not sure I believe her.\u201d</p> <p>Tanden replied: \u201cI mean it makes my life more difficult after telling every reporter I know she\u2019s actually progressive but that is really the smallest of issues. It worries me more that she doesn\u2019t seem to know what planet we are all living in at the moment.\u201d</p> <p>The daily dump of stolen emails has uncovered Clinton\u2019s lucrative Wall Street speeches, lists of <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/19/us/politics/clinton-vice-president-wikileaks.html\">39 potential vice-presidents</a> and 84 potential campaign slogans, fresh questions over a conflict of interest with the Clinton Foundation and alleged advance warnings of debate questions. But there have been few revelations likely to alter the course of the race for the White House.</p> <p>In fact, just as WikiLeaks\u2019 release of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/the-us-embassy-cables\">US embassy cables</a> often showed diplomats\u2019 judgment in a flattering light, so the Podesta emails have illuminated a micromanaged campaign operation with a laser-like focus and little by way of ill-discipline or even foul language. The nerve centre is, however, all too aware of its candidate\u2019s weaknesses and sensitive to media criticism, and as prone as any other office to personality clashes, terse exchanges and mutual exasperation.</p> <p>The email treasure trove also lifts the lid on the complications of celebrity endorsements. In August 2015, Betsy Jones, assistant to the hip-hop star Q-Tip, <a href=\"https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/39998\">wrote to Podesta</a> to propose a meeting with Clinton \u201cto discuss ways he can be used as bridge to the hip-hop generation during the 2016 presidential campaign\u201d. Q-Tip \u201ceven served as DJ for Chelsea Clinton\u2019s 25th birthday party in 2005\u201d, she noted.</p> <p>Podesta forwarded the email to colleagues, one of whom was Weiner\u2019s wife Huma Abedin. \u201cQ-Tip? Seriously?\u201d she wrote. \u201cI am so old.\u201d</p> <p>Another, Kristina Schake, weighed in: \u201cI\u2019ve actually seen Q-tip in concert and if this meeting happens I would like to staff her.\u201d She elaborated: \u201cWith both the Beastie Boys and the Chemical Brothers!\u201d</p> <p>But then the conversation took a darker turn when another member of Clinton staff, presumably responsible for background checks, raised concerns over Q-Tip: \u201cThere are a couple of altercations he pleaded guilty to, but they were from a while back. However, more recently shouted \u2018pigs\u2019 at NYPD officers while protesting the grand jury decision not to indict Darren Wilson.\u201d</p> <p>It took a while, but the meeting did go ahead.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/nov/05/beyonce-jay-z-back-clinton-ohio-cleveland-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/5azaz\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2871825\"            data-video-name=\"'Vote for someone who cares': Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay Z back Clinton as woman for job \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"AP\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-581d7fc2e4b0d073c27d1b2e\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/11/05/161105BeyonceClinton_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/11/05/161105BeyonceClinton_V3.webm\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/11/05/161105BeyonceClinton.m3u8\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/nov/05/beyonce-jay-z-back-clinton-ohio-cleveland-video\">\u2018Vote for someone who cares\u2019: Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay Z back Clinton as woman for job</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Then there are campaign surrogates who go rogue. Lanny Davis, a lawyer and former special counsel to Bill Clinton during his presidency, put his foot in it when talking about Clinton\u2019s email server on TV. Later that day Robby Mook, now the campaign manager, <a href=\"https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/41556\">emailed Podesta:</a> \u201cWe gotta zap Lanny out of our universe. Can\u2019t believe he committed her to a private review of her hard drive on TV.\u201d</p> <p>In May last year, <a href=\"https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/6370\">Podesta wrote</a> of longtime Clinton family friend Sidney Blumenthal: \u201cIt always amazes me that people like Sid either completely lack self awareness or self respect. Maybe both. Will you promise to shoot me if I ever end up like that?\u201d</p> <p>Podesta, 67, runs a tight ship and has an unenviable job. Countless people want to give him advice or meet him for dinner. In September last year, columnist Brent Budowsky wrote <a href=\"https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/40328\">a long, panicked email</a> about visiting a university campus where Sanders had a booth but Clinton did not. \u201cThis is happening at every major campus in America,\u201d he warned darkly.</p> <p>Referring to a <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2015/09/hillary-clinton-2016-proxies-attack-bernie-sanders-213359\">Politico story</a> about attacks on Sanders by Clinton surrogates, Budowsky went on: \u201cThe way NOT to handle Bernie is to telegraph how afraid the Clinton campaign is of him, and then dispense covert talking points that cannot be put in writing that embody the oldest politics that will only infuriate many liberal Democrats and give an already-biased media a legitimate story line to push.\u201d</p> <p>Podesta gave a characterically brisk response that ended: \u201cWhy do you think that story is not just a bunch of hyped up BS intended to have exactly the kind of reaction you are exhibiting?\u201d </p>",

  "<p>Sitting in a studio in Kensington, London, the designer Sebastian Conran walks me through a worst-case scenario. \u201cBasically, what it\u2019s looking for is a break in routine,\u201d he explains, pointing to a drawing of an elderly woman, collapsed on the floor of her home. \u201cThere\u2019s an event. The e-sensor in the room notices that you\u2019ve fallen over. MiRo goes to investigate.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"http://consequentialrobotics.com/\" title=\"\">MiRo</a> is a robotic dog. There is an early model close to where we are sitting. Its head sits above a torso without arms or legs, and its cartoonish eyes stare out below alert ears embedded with speakers. Conran\u2019s company describes it as a biomimetic companion robot, and says it will eventually work with facial recognition technology to make life easier for its owner \u2013 to prompt them to take medicine, or to remind them of visitors\u2019 names, or to question them if it thinks they\u2019re in trouble. Conran tells me to think of it as a cross between a pet and Radio 4\u2019s John Humphrys.</p> <p>\u201cIt tries talking to you,\u201d he continues, \u201cand then it will send a signal to the hub saying there seems to be a problem. The hub will then broadcast on the home speaker, asking again if you\u2019re all right, and telling you to slap your wrist.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The thing about human care is, unless you\u2019re particularly disabled you don\u2019t need someone there all the time</p> <footer> <cite>Sebastian Conran</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Conran points at the wristband the woman in the picture is wearing. It is another key part of his system, monitoring the vital signs of its wearer 24 hours a day. \u201cIf you slap your wrist the process will stop but will be logged,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you don\u2019t slap your wrist it will break through security, and go to a carer, who can see your heart rate and body temperature, and rewind your life using the cameras in the home to see what happened. So when the ambulance gets there, they\u2019ll know what they\u2019re working with.\u201d</p> <p>In this scenario all aspects of the house come together \u2013 the sensors in the room, the wristband, the biomimetic companion robot, the data hub, the cameras embedded in the ceiling\u2026 At other times, however, the system coalesces less firmly around the person living inside the home. Elsewhere in Conran\u2019s studio is a robot table being developed with Sheffield University. The table adjusts itself to suit the user\u2019s size and moves on four wheels across the floor directed by voice commands and tracking optics in the ceiling. The eventual aim is to attach a robotic arm to it, so that the table can move around the home, picking things up from shelves and bringing them to the user. Order a dinner from the apartment canteen, and the table will scoot through the building to deliver it.</p> <p>\u201cThe thing about human care is, unless you\u2019re particularly disabled you don\u2019t need someone there all the time,\u201d Conran says. \u201cBut you do need to deal with loneliness and fear. If a carer comes to see you twice a week for an hour, what\u2019s happening in between? What\u2019s happening to people when a carer isn\u2019t there?\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5be977f64fc4e0767e453eea4ec3ec374ca77bfd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5be977f64fc4e0767e453eea4ec3ec374ca77bfd/0_246_2500_1499/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Japan\u2019s Robear, which is capable of lifting patients.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Japan\u2019s Robear, which is capable of lifting patients.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jiji Press/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Conran is not the only one to ask these questions and look for answers in the use of robots and smart systems. In Japan, for example, where <a href=\"http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.65UP.TO.ZS?locations=JP\" title=\"\">26% of the population is aged 65 years or older</a>, Dr Toshiharu Mukai of Meijo University has been developing a robot capable of lifting patients out of beds and into wheelchairs. It\u2019s called <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/feb/27/robear-bear-shaped-nursing-care-robot\" title=\"\">Robear</a>, is designed to look like an approachable white bear, and could, if successful, do a job that would normally involve several care workers. Closer to home, in Grantham, a prototype care robot was recently introduced to a sheltered housing centre. Part of an <a href=\"http://www.enrichme.eu/wordpress/\" title=\"\">EU-funded project</a> dedicated to investigating the ways technology can improve the day-to-day lives of elderly people, the robot is designed in part to \u2013 much like Conran\u2019s MiRo \u2013 combat loneliness, and to offer reminders for tasks such as taking medicine.</p> <p>Many of these visions are nascent, but at a time of rising elderly populations and dwindling public resources, they raise important questions about where we are going with care. Can robots serve as a useful supplement to human contact, or do economic realities mean technology is pushing us towards a future where some of society\u2019s most vulnerable are passed into the loving arms of machines?</p> <p>Travel up the A1 from London to a leafy parish in the home counties, and you\u2019ll find a house owned by the University of Hertfordshire. The two-storey building looks from the outside just like any other suburban home in Hatfield. There is a doorbell beside the front door, there are sofas, chairs, beds. There is food in the kitchen, there are pictures in frames. It isn\u2019t until you glimpse a monolithic, 200kg care robot that you can tell this isn\u2019t exactly a normal household.</p> <p>\u201cWe first did studies on campus. As researchers, that\u2019s what you usually do \u2013 lab experiments,\u201d says Kerstin Dautenhahn, professor of artificial intelligence at the University of Hertfordshire. \u201cWhat we found is that participants in the experiment didn\u2019t really buy into the idea. What we realised is that we need to provide a more naturalistic environment. Something real.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/sep/20/automated-city-robots-run-public-services-councils\">The automated city: do we still need humans to run public services?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Like Conran\u2019s vision of robotic companions and autonomous tables, Dautenhahn\u2019s home is angled towards a future where machines play a large part in how we care for the elderly. She says her coterie of robots provide a number of functions, from physical and cognitive assistance to social help. Some of the technology in the home is designed to help users fetch objects, some is made to remind them to take their medicine, some of it is designed to remind a person exactly who is standing beside them.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s also equipped as a smart home,\u201d she says. \u201cWe have more than 60 sensors in that house, not only omnidirectional cameras that can identify and track people, but also various sensors, such as ones for temperature, attached to all the hot and cold water taps, so we know when someone is in the bathroom and using the taps or flushing the toilet.</p> <p>\u201cWe have sensors attached to all the electrical devices, such as the TV, the kettle, the toaster and the fridge, so again we can detect when someone opens the fridge door, or puts on the kettle,\u201d she adds. \u201cWe\u2019ve also developed some algorithms for activity recognition, so based on the patterns of \u2013 for example \u2013 when someone makes a typical dinner or breakfast.\u201d</p> <p>Dautenhahn explains that the home observes a person\u2019s activities, and then makes judgments based on those observations. If the house can tell that a person is making breakfast, it could send a robot to approach and offer help. The sensors, with their ability to track activities and log this in a central data hub, allow the system to make predictions about a person\u2019s routine, and to notice if the routine has changed \u2013 if they are eating or exercising less, for example, or sleeping more. Sit in front of the TV for too long, and a robot could come around to encourage you to move.</p> <p>The last thing the researchers want is for people to feel bossed around, though Dautenhahn admits it\u2019s a difficult balance to strike. If you have a system that is created to protect an elderly person, and it notices that the homeowner hasn\u2019t drunk a glass of water for six hours, should it say something? Should it tell a neighbour?</p> <p>\u201cAt the moment I have a PhD student who is specifically investigating our sense of control,\u201d says Dautenhahn. \u201cFor me, as a researcher, this issue has been part of our whole research agenda all the way. If you have a system in your house that is with you 24/7, monitoring everything that you do, then what you really don\u2019t want is to have the feeling that there\u2019s this super robot in the house \u2013 that you\u2019re no longer in control. If you have someone all the time criticising you, telling you that you haven\u2019t had anything to drink for five hours, you\u2019ll ask yourself: whose house is this?\u201d</p> <p>So whose house is it?</p> <p>When you consider the possibility of homes hosting a small army of integrated sensors and robots that may or may not be modelled on large white bears, you have to ask yourself whether these solutions conflict with the layout of, say, Edwardian terraced houses or postwar tower blocks. Dautenhahn bought a suburban home to test robots in a real-life living environment, but even she acknowledges that the clutter of everyday life isn\u2019t best suited to robots doing their job.</p> <p>\u201cFew people only have laminate flooring, no carpet or rugs, where everything is nice and clean and smooth,\u201d she says. \u201cThere\u2019s usually lots of things people have in their environment that make it more complex for robots. This is why some people argue that it might be better in the future for newly built homes to accommodate the requirements of technological solutions.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QoS-40Xe75Q\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/QoS-40Xe75Q?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QoS-40Xe75Q\">Toyota\u2019s human support robot.</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>With this comes a big question: should the homes of the future be designed around robots? A demo in 2015 for <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QoS-40Xe75Q\" title=\"\">Toyota\u2019s human support robot</a> \u2013 again designed to address the growing demand for long-term elderly care in Japan \u2013 shows the one-armed robot picking up objects in a bookcase lined with plastic boxes, each emblazoned with a label that the robot\u2019s vision algorithms were able to detect. Such systems will presumably become less clunky over time, but image living in a house where you have to put everything you own into plastic boxes with labels for a robot to recognise. What will that do to a person\u2019s sense of control, not to mention personal identity?</p> <p>There is clearly a balance to be struck, but if we\u2019re thinking about radical changes to the architecture of our homes, what other sorts of structures we should be looking at? One nursing home in the Netherlands, for example, offers rent-free apartments to students in exchange for 30 hours of work each month with their elderly neighbours. Elsewhere in the Netherlands, the <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/11/the-dutch-village-where-everyone-has-dementia/382195/\" title=\"\">village of Hogewey</a>, on the outskirts of Amsterdam, has been built from the ground up to accommodate dementia patients. The 23 buildings in Hogewey are designed to be exact replicas of homes from the 1950s and the 1970s, each built to fit a person\u2019s perception of reality.</p> <p>Both of these, in very different ways, show that there is scope for social architecture that reconfigures the position of the elderly in society without technology. Instead of designing the architecture of our future around smart systems, should we be looking at structures that encourage cross-generational interaction, or that shape themselves in response to diseases such as Alzheimer\u2019s? Perhaps, but there are, as always, economic issues.</p> <p>\u201cThere are fantastic examples of supportive, dignified care, and examples of carefully building community links between generations that function as a support system with benefits for both sides,\u201d says Lydia Nicholas, a digital anthropologist who has worked with the likes of Nesta, the Science Museum and the BBC. \u201cUnfortunately right now these are in conflict with enormous pressure to immediately cut costs.</p> <p>\u201cThese dementia villages employ a lot of people; they are expensive to run and have very long waiting lists. For a system under pressure it can be tempting instead to turn to technology solutions where potentially one nurse could look after many people because she has so much data on how all of them are moving and sleeping, whether they\u2019re eating on schedule, etc. In the short term sensors are cheap and people are expensive. But people can provide that essential human touch and connection that supports our health over the long term.\u201d</p> <p>Nicholas tells me that it is unwise to think about future care for the elderly in terms of mutually exclusive visions. The aged population is not a monolithic entity but a varied range of age groups with different needs, different levels of ability and independence. It\u2019s not a question about all-in with technology or all-in with new social architectures, but rather a discussion about how these things can work together. That said, there are concerns about how machines can work with the current human-based care system, especially when you\u2019re dealing with councils facing increasingly precarious balance sheets.</p> <p>\u201cAs costs rise we could end up with the system either spending more and more on getting the same level of human care, or ending up with a lot less, and having to work with that in different ways,\u201d says Nicholas. \u201cWe need to be ambitious, creative and careful in these new systems.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I\u2019d personally be afraid if systems are being used to replace human contact</p> <footer> <cite>Kerstin Dautenhahn, professor of AI</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The technologists are keen to impress that their creations are designed to work alongside human care, not to replace it. And yet they also admit that they don\u2019t have a great deal of say in how their technology will actually be implemented. There\u2019s a sense that, in spite of good intentions, these techno-utopian visions could find themselves undermined by economic obstacles, not to mention fissures in our social fabric.</p> <p>\u201cThere is a kind of crisis,\u201d says Nicholas. \u201cThe question is whether you can build systems that enable people to build their own support networks. Using technology and system change as much as possible, are there ways you can connect people up to their local community? Of course health and social care challenges don\u2019t exist in a vacuum; these issues must be addressed in the wider context of urgently needed work on community building and social cohesion in post-Brexit Britain.\u201d</p> <p>I ask Dautenhahn, as someone who designs robots that may one day be commonplace in care homes, whether there are concerns about how her machines may be used. \u201cI completely see that there is a danger for formal carers,\u201d she says. \u201cThe NHS for example could at some point decide the robots are doing a really good job, so maybe they can cut costs. Rather than having two visits a day, we could have just two visits a week, because, as you say, they have all the data.</p> <p>\u201cThis is certainly not something I\u2019d advocate,\u201d she adds. \u201cI\u2019d personally be afraid if systems are being used to replace human contact, because there is a lot of misunderstanding about what robots are \u2013 that robots could have human-like qualities and give emotional support. For me, this is absolutely out of the question.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/aug/30/rise-of-robots-evil-artificial-intelligence-uc-berkeley\">The rise of robots: forget evil AI \u2013 the real risk is far more insidious</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Dautenhahn says she is against the idea of robots that resemble humans precisely for this reason. She tells me that there are things humans are good at, and there are things machines are good at. Posing a robot as a human could dangerously confuse these lines, potentially misleading authorities facing a strong drive to cut costs and automate processes. \u201cI can see this danger,\u201d she says. \u201cTherefore it is very important that we have this public discussion.\u201d</p> <p>Back in Conran\u2019s studio, he runs me through his vision of a smart home for an independent elderly person. He shows me a sketch of a single-floor flat. Sensors are dotted throughout, an autonomous table tends to the kitchen and a pair of MiRos wait attentively, close to the home\u2019s occupants. If one of them should fall, the robot dog will be on hand to ask them if they are OK. The sensor on their wrist will confirm if they aren\u2019t.</p> <p>Putting aside the question of whether the potential success of such a system would inadvertently dissuade authorities from investing in human carers, is a home like this something a person would actually want? Conran mentions an interesting point. For the generations now growing up that are accustomed to digital culture, centred on their whims and aspirations, the idea of 24-hour attention may even be desired.</p> <p>\u201cThese people are going to have completely different expectations,\u201d he says. \u201cWe expect the state to provide for us in a way that previous generations maybe didn\u2019t. Life has constantly got better and better, and we\u2019re coming up against the fact that, instead of getting better and better, things are dropping off. Ageing is not to be recommended.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Germany fears Britain may pull out of a key intelligence-sharing programme in May next year, a move that it says would create a \u201cmoment of weakness\u201d in the fight against terrorism and jeopardise security across the EU.</p> <p>As the continent remains on alert for terrorist attacks, Berlin is understood to view intelligence as Britain\u2019s primary contribution to European collaboration, and fears it could use future cooperation as a bargaining chip in Brexit negotiations.</p> <p>According to documents seen by the Guardian, Germany is already lobbying the British government to renew its role in Europe\u2019s law enforcement agency, Europol, before its current collaboration runs out on 1 May 2017.</p> <p>In a response to a parliamentary question submitted by Germany\u2019s Left party, Angela Merkel\u2019s government confirmed that it believed the European commission should encourage the UK to remain in Europol.</p> <p>Doing so was in Britain\u2019s interest, the document produced by the German interior ministry said, because \u201ccollaborating and sharing information via Europol can help the UK prevent and fight terrorism and serious crime\u201d.</p> <p>After a series of attempted terrorist attacks over the summer and a politically charged debate about the risks of Merkel\u2019s stance during the refugee crisis, German politicians in particular are concerned that Britain could use its large intelligence capacities as a bargaining chip.</p> <p>\u201cRecent attacks and arrests of suspected terrorists have shown that a close collaboration between international security agencies is indispensable,\u201d said Stephan Mayer, the interior policy spokesperson of Merkel\u2019s CDU/CSU party group. \u201cEven after a possible Brexit, the fight against terrorism will remain an enormous challenge for European states; and this naturally applies to Europol\u2019s work too.</p> <p>\u201cAll those responsible have to guarantee that this cooperation continues successfully and without friction in spite of a Brexit. The international fight against Islamic extremism and terrorism cannot afford a moment of weakness.\u201d</p> <p>European governments and Brussels officials have been emphasising in public that there can be no pre-negotiations with Britain, <a href=\"http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-eu-commissioner-idUKKCN1021KY\">however informal</a>, until May officially informs the EU of its intention to leave by triggering article 50. Before October\u2019s European council meeting in Brussels, German government officials vehemently denied that security cooperation would form part of the discussions at the summit.</p> <p>But the EU\u2019s united front has been undermined by some inconvenient timetabling. On 1 May 2017, a month after the deadline May has given herself for triggering article 50, the European Union will adopt a regulation that expands the role of the European parliament and national EU legislatures in supervising Europol\u2019s operations.</p> <p>On Friday, May <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/nov/04/brexit-timetable-article-50-ruling-theresa-may-jean-claude-juncker-eu\">told EU officials</a> that she would stick to her deadline in spite of the high court\u2019s decision that her government must get parliamentary approval to trigger article 50. Some MPs have suggested the need to draft new legislation may further squeeze the planned timetable.</p> <p>The UK is not part of the border-free Schengen zone and has an opt-in into Europol, which will automatically expire as soon as the new rules come into effect. By dropping out of Europol, the UK would automatically be shut out of a number of other agencies and intelligence cooperation programmes, such as the Schengen-wide information system SIS II.</p> <p>A Home Office spokesman pointed to recent comments made by Brandon Lewis, the policing minister, who said no decision had yet been taken on Europol. \u201cThe decision on whether we opt into the further Europol regulations will be announced to parliament shortly. We will take that decision very soon; we are giving good consideration to where we are on that and will make an announcement to parliament in due course,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Last week Lewis <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/theresa-may-has-decided-to-opt-into-eu-crime-fighting-measures-risking-anger-of-brexit-tory-mps-a7391666.html\">confirmed in a letter</a> that the UK would press ahead with an opt-in to the Pr\u00fcm convention, an EU-wide system for sharing DNA samples, fingerprints and vehicle registration.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.andrej-hunko.de/start/download/doc_download/864-gutachten-des-wissenschaftlichen-dienstes-im-bundestag-zu-konsequenzen-des-brexit-fuer-den-bereich-inneres-justiz\">A report</a> (pdf) by the German parliament\u2019s academic service recently raised alarm over the hole that Brexit could leave in Europe\u2019s security network, and pointed out that the UK would no longer have direct access to Europol\u2019s databases.</p> <p>Europol, which is based in The Hague, started operations in 1999 and is funded through the EU budget. It has a British director, Rob Wainwright, and according to a spokesperson, 40% of its cases have a \u201cBritish dimension\u201d.</p> <p>German government officials told the Guardian that there was still hope in Berlin that as a former home secretary, May would appreciate the value of cooperating on counter-terrorism measures. In a private speech at Goldman Sachs before the EU referendum, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/25/exclusive-leaked-recording-shows-what-theresa-may-really-thinks-about-brexit?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other\">recently leaked to the Guardian</a>, May expressly argued that British security was best served by remaining in Europe.</p> <p>The German Left party MP Andrej Hunko, who submitted the query to the government, said that although the UK had been one of the main drivers behind Europol\u2019s engagement in covert intelligence networking, Britain opting out of the agency could potentially give rise to even more informal and less democratically accountable forms of information-sharing.</p> <p>\u201cAfter Brexit, the strengthening of informal structures such as the police working group on terrorism and the Club de Berne could become a major cause for concern\u201d, Hunko said. \u201cThese institutions don\u2019t form part of the European Union and are thus harder to control by either delegates in the European parliament or our national parliaments, with national governments remaining as secretive about such networks as they can.\u201d</p> <p>From the position of the German Left party, Hunko said, \u201cthe question of whether British police should remain part of Europol is therefore a choice between the devil and the deep blue sea\u201d.</p>",

Steven Bochco is a hugely successful American TV producer. He created <a href=\"http://variety.com/2016/tv/news/steven-bochco-l-a-law-reboot-1201827966/\"><em>LA Law</em></a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/sep/17/hill-street-blues-1981-emmy-awards\"><em>Hill Street Blues</em></a><em> \u2013</em> a groundbreaking show which had many story lines, several leading characters, and changed the dynamic of TV drama. It kicked off the modern golden age of television \u2013 he basically invented the modern hour-long TV drama. He has some great anecdotes in this book about actors and their behaviour \u2013 he wrote for the first season of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2012/jan/23/natalie-haynes-detectives-columbo\"><em>Columbo</em></a> and apparently Peter Falk wasn\u2019t well behaved. Bochco has a nice turn of phrase and a way of bringing the industry to life in a way that I very much recognise.</p> <h2>2 | Game</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.lockedcanada.com/\"><strong>Locked Canada</strong></a></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7306a8ef1dbbbd373457179306446f680c935c1b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7306a8ef1dbbbd373457179306446f680c935c1b/0_31_1296_778/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Locked canada, an escape room game.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018You work out clues from the things around you\u2019: Locked Canada.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lockedcanada.com</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A few weeks ago I went to an \u201cescape room\u201d with some other cast members [Harewood is filming <a href=\"http://supergirl.wikia.com/wiki/Season_2\"><em>Supergirl season 2</em></a> in Vancouver] and it was really good fun. You go to a warehouse, choose from different experiences, such as zombies, and you have to make your way out of a room. There are obscure questions and puzzles, and you work out the clues from the things around you \u2013 such as a calculator and paper, or things written on the wall in red, like blood. The room we chose was difficult, I think only 5% had ever got out of it.

The writing and acting are second to none. It\u2019s such a clever take on the original movie, trying to work out who\u2019s human and who\u2019s not. It\u2019s about an amusement park where visitors can enjoy the wild west, and there are robots that you can talk to, have sex with, shoot, kill, beat up \u2013 anything. But unbeknown to the park\u2019s creators, the robots are developing awareness and intelligence. There are shots of the robots with flies crawling over them; apparently they have a fly-wrangler on set, who freezes the flies and puts them on people\u2019s faces, where they slowly start to thaw. It\u2019s bizarre but looks incredible.</p> <h2>4 | Film</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/oct/29/moonlight-movie-barry-jenkins-black-gay\"><strong>Moonlight (2016)</strong></a></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a057c86f943f6f7c80f5983329152bed9fd403e5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a057c86f943f6f7c80f5983329152bed9fd403e5/0_133_2000_1200/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018MOONLIGHT\u2019 (2016) Directed By BARRY JENKINS 02 September 2016\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018This looks at the soft, sensitive side of black masculinity\u2019: Alex R Hibbert in Moonlight.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/A24</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I\u2019m looking forward to seeing this adaptation of a play called <em>In Moonlight Black Boys Look Blue</em>, by <a href=\"https://www.steppenwolf.org/\">Steppenwolf</a> [theatre company] writer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/oct/21/moonlight-film-tarell-alvin-mccraney-interview\">Tarell Alvin McCraney</a>.

  "<p>Before Astrid Lindgren became the JK Rowling of her day \u2013 her red-haired, freckled and fearless <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2015/sep/09/pippi-longstocking-a-feminist-an-optimist-and-a-free-thinker\" title=\"\">Pippi Longstocking</a> adored by children the world over \u2013 she was a 32-year-old secretary turned wife and mother going about her life in Stockholm when war broke out.

It would do the Germans good to see it\u201d \u2013 Lindgren recounts the commotions of the grand theatres of war alongside the domestic dramas playing out in her life. By and large, the former preoccupies her attention.</p> <p>She gleans her information from a variety of written sources: daily newspapers (her original diary was full of pasted-in press cuttings), the news of which she reports fastidiously, demonstrating a keen understanding of the complex global political machinations at play; and the private post sent to, and coming from, other countries. She worked as a censor at the postal control division, describing it before she starts as \u201csecret \u2018defence work\u2019\u201d, but by the time it finishes in 1945, \u201cmy \u2018sordid job\u2019\u201d.</p> <p>Rare personal distractions appear in the form of her daughter Karin\u2019s persistent ill health \u2013 it was she for whom Pippi was invented, to entertain the 10-year old while bedridden with measles \u2013 and a crisis in Lindgren\u2019s marriage in the summer of 1944: \u201cBlood is spilt, people are maimed, misery and despair are everywhere.

So there we have it, South Africa turning the screw on the hosts at lunch on day four, with Australia having had very little to shout about so far today. The question is now: when will Steve Smith and his team get a chance to chase down the Proteas\u2019 big total and enter the record books with the highest successful run chase in the history of Test cricket? The feeling is not quite yet, with no indication from Faf du Plessis that they\u2019re about to declare over a cucumber sandwich or two in the pavilion. </p> <p>Other questions to mull over while bellies are filling: should Maharaj and Philander re-emerge after the break, do the Proteas run the risk of leaving it too late to bowl out Australia with less than five sessions to go? The longer the South African innings goes on, might Australia be scared off going for victory? It may appear to be a one-way street to a South African victory, but some intrigue at least remains.</p> <p>Not sure if Adam mention this earlier, but in case he didn\u2019t, the highest successful run chase of all time came in 2003, when West Indies reached 418-7 to defeat Australia in St John\u2019s. Here are the next best:</p> <p>414-4 - South Africa beat Australia in Perth in 2008<br>406-4 - India beat West Indies in Port of Spain in 1976<br>404-3 - Australia beat England in Leeds in 1948<br>387-4 - India beat England in Chennai in 2008<br>382-3 - Pakistan beat Sri Lanka in Pallekele in 2015<br>369-6 - Australia beat Pakistan in Hobart in 1999</p> <p>Anyway, it\u2019d be great to get your thoughts on this match, and the second session in particular. Speak your brains on Twitter (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/mike_hytner\">@mike_hytner</a>) on via email (<a href=\"mailto:mike.hytner@theguardian.com\">mike.hytner@theguardian.com</a>).

Then bat some more if the opportunity allowed. But in order to achieve another day of grind, they had to get in again. If the tourists lost four wickets in a hurry, Australia would have remained vaguely in this game. </p> <p>In full knowledge of this, de Kock and Philander went about slowly building up their base to begin, happy enough to see of maidens and let the Australian attack leaders come and go before capitalising either side of the drinks break. de Kock\u2019s hefty hitting included a glorious pair of straight sixes down the ground to welcome Lyon to the attack, summing up the nature of the challenge for the Australian tweaker. </p> <p>The South African \u2018keeper/bat was given out twice by the on-field umpires - once caught down legside off Hazlewood and lbw off Lyon - but both were overturned. Between times, Philander was dropped on the boundary by Hazlewood; a chance he should have taken at fine leg. </p> <p>De Kock finally went for 64 when miscuing a drive off Marsh, taken nicely by Voges in the gully, their stand 119. But this didn\u2019t stop Philander who continued playing his shots in the final half hour, collecting his fifth career half century along the way and making it to lunch unbeaten. </p> <p>For Australia, it got scrappier as the morning went on, illustrated by the 41 extras they have conceded so far in the innings, principally through wides and byes. Simply put, they\u2019ve spent. With a deficit of 506 and three wickets till to take, the only way out of this for the home side is batting for a very long time. After the punishing weekend they\u2019ve had so far, that would be as good as a win. </p> <p>Enough already. Mike Hytner will be here to take guard after the lunch break. Enjoy his company, as I have yours. Provided we\u2019re still going, I\u2019ll see you tomorrow. </p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-11-06T04:44:37.173Z\">at 4.44am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-581eb209e4b029b92ca45f4d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-06T04:32:27.286Z\">4.32am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>157th over: South Africa 508-7 (Philander 63, Maharaj 19) </strong>Nondescript end to a nondescript session.

It rather neatly sums up Australia\u2019s collective disposition coming into this fourth day at Perth. With the South African tourists 388 ahead with four wickets in hand, the theoretically possible is the realistically highly improbable for the hosts.</p> <p>But you need not despair, because we\u2019re back with the live over by over coverage for this fourth day here at the Waca Ground in Perth. I\u2019m Adam Collins, I\u2019ll be here on the tools for the first session before Mike Hytner takes over for the afternoon, and JP Howcroft the evening. A good morning (or afternoon, or evening, wherever you are in the world) to you all.</p> <p>I can report that it is a bit sweaty outside, but in contrast to yesterday, it is not forecast to get any hotter than it is at the moment, floating around the low-to-mid 20s. A fact the depleted South African pace attack (read, duo) would have enjoyed when checking their phones this morning.</p> <p>It was Dean Elgar and JP Duminy who did all they could to bury Australian hopes in this opening rubber yesterday afternoon. Batting for two entire sessions, the left-handers seldom gave a chance. As Aussie coach Darren Lehmann has said this morning, he is \u201cvery happy with the effort\u201d of his bowlers, and believes with a bit of luck they could have taken all the required wickets yesterday. It wasn\u2019t their failings, it was the supreme concentration of the visiting batsmen, Elgar finishing with 127 (from 314 balls, if you don\u2019t mind) and Duminy a delicious 141.</p> <p>Where\u2019s that leave us? Well, this is the very ground that 414 was chased down in during this corresponding fixture in 2008. Albeit from the other mob. That\u2019s the second highest successful chase in the history of Test cricket and they\u2019ve been at this caper for 140 years.</p> <p>Duminy was part of that memorable chase, and Dale Steyn the XI as well. His absence in the fourth innings here (and possibly the third if he doesn\u2019t bat) is hugely significant. It leads Lehmann to believe that his side can \u201cchase down anything.\u201d Of course, after losing 10-for-86 on Friday, that\u2019s a bit bold. But what\u2019s the alternative?</p> <p>Okay, we\u2019re about 15 minutes until go time, so grab a bottle of fanta and a bag of chicken twisties and ready yourself.

  "<p>Like the heavy-framed C\u00e9line glasses that Amy Adams dons to read the story-within-a-story of this interlocking psychological drama, Tom Ford\u2019s second feature is a handsomely crafted affair, designed to within an inch of its life to combine crystal-clear vision with eye-catching style. Working from Austin Wright\u2019s 1993 novel, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/may/02/tony-and-susan-austin-wright\"><em>Tony and Susan</em></a>, writer-director Ford filters the central concerns of the source material (a cautionary tale about love, loyalty, guilt and false gods) through the precise prism of his own distinctively machined lens. Crisp editing by Joan Sobel ensures the film\u2019s joints are supple, with finely honed narrative hinges opening and closing in pleasingly swish fashion. That the finished product should appear just a little <em>too</em> transparent is perhaps the price one pays for this level of polish. Like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jul/01/nicolas-winding-refn-neon-demon-interview\">Nicolas Winding Refn</a>\u2019s oddly comparable <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jul/10/the-neon-demon-review-nicholas-winding-refn\"><em>The Neon Demon</em></a>, <em>Nocturnal Animals</em> may ultimately be an exercise in surface sheen. But what surface! And what sheen!</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/oct/23/tom-ford-suit-set-film-nocturnal-animals-director\">Tom Ford: \u2018I wore a suit on set. It's a uniform\u2026 I feel weak in trainers\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>After a notoriously jarring opening sequence (a slo-mo carnival of fleshy Americana), we meet Amy Adams\u2019s pinched Susan Morrow, a disillusioned art dealer living in a glass-cage modernist LA house with her handsome creep husband, Hutton (Armie Hammer). Financially, the couple are faltering; emotionally, they are falling apart. Out of the blue, Susan receives a package \u2013 a manuscript from her ex-husband Edward (Jake Gyllenhaal), which promptly gives her a paper cut, significantly drawing blood. A sensitive soul whom Susan apparently abandoned in \u201chorrible\u201d circumstances, Edward used to call his wife a \u201cnocturnal animal\u201d. Now that sobriquet has become the title of his as-yet-unpublished novel, which he has dedicated to her: a visceral, anguished tale (\u201cit\u2019s violent and it\u2019s sad\u201d) of brutal assault and ugly revenge in which a family are run off the road by rednecks in rural west Texas, with horrifying results.</p> <p>Having been captivated by Adams\u2019s mesmerising performance in Tim Burton\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/dec/28/big-eyes-review-tim-burton-amy-adams\"><em>Big Eyes</em></a>, Ford here makes the most of that extraordinarily expressive face, focusing tightly on her all-but-still visage as she reads Edward\u2019s increasingly harrowing work. And as Susan reads, Ford visualises \u2013 conjuring a dramatised version of the novel in which Gyllenhaal doubles as self-loathing husband and father, Tony Hastings, while Isla Fisher (whom audiences have long confused with Adams) is very smartly cast as Susan\u2019s barely disguised stand-in, Laura Hastings. Soon, this fictional world becomes more real than Susan\u2019s waking-dream existence, with Michael Shannon breathing tangible, rasping life into Detective Andes, an end-of-the-line chain-smoker with a hacking cough and little patience for the niceties of law enforcement. Meanwhile, flashbacks of Susan and Edward\u2019s former life (a third story strand) find Laura Linney nearly stealing the show as the conservative mother from hell who taunts Susan about how alike they are, and who prophetically insists that \u201cthe things you love about [Edward] now are the things you\u2019ll hate in a few years\u2026\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2016/nov/02/tom-ford-amy-adams-aaron-taylor-johnson-nocturnal-animals-video-interview\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/5afdy\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2865342\"            data-video-name=\"Tom Ford on Nocturnal Animals: 'I'm conflicted about what I do' \u2013 video interview\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-5819dfabe4b07ceadb3a19ba\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/11/02/161102NocturnalAnimalsJunket_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/11/02/161102NocturnalAnimalsJunket.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/11/02/161102NocturnalAnimalsJunket_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2016/nov/02/tom-ford-amy-adams-aaron-taylor-johnson-nocturnal-animals-video-interview\">Tom Ford on Nocturnal Animals: \u2018I\u2019m conflicted about what I do\u2019</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Expanding confidently from the chamber piece confines of 2009\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/feb/14/a-single-man-film-review\"><em>A Single Man</em></a>, Ford makes an impressive fist of mimicking the mood of Hitchcock, the skewed reality of Lynch, the grit of the Coen brothers, and the obsessive attention to detail of Kubrick. Seamus McGarvey\u2019s widescreen cinematography perfectly captures the contrasting environments of the film\u2019s sinewy, intertwined settings \u2013 from the reflective surfaces of Susan\u2019s LA life, to the more human hues of her past with Edward, and the cruel vistas of his own neo-noir narrative. Gradually, these disparate worlds seep into one another, whether through talismanic items (a red sofa, a green sports car, a crucifix pendant) that cross the boundaries of fact and fiction, or through carefully choreographed cuts that find bodies similarly arrayed in the lands of the living and the dead. Underpinning it all is <a href=\"http://www.abelkorzeniowski.com/\">Abel Korzeniowski\u2019</a>s gorgeous Herrmann-esque score, which harks back to the psychodramas of the 40s and 50s, a gripping blend of romance, mystery and discordant horror.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ffb7c36613141e478e4ed4973d89839b1a0d4380\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ffb7c36613141e478e4ed4973d89839b1a0d4380/0_49_1505_903/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jake Gyllenhaal in Nocturnal Animals.

Perhaps it is this studied air of perfection that occasionally robs <em>Nocturnal Animals</em> of a beating human heart, despite an extraordinarily physical performance by an unrecognisable Aaron Taylor-Johnson as the nightmarish Ray, the embodiment of the film\u2019s feral fears. On first viewing, I was knocked out. Second time around, the film seemed more cleverly complex but also more calculating. Perhaps a third viewing will solve its knotty problems? Somehow I doubt it. Yet the fact that I\u2019m contemplating seeing it again speaks volumes about its strangely seductive power, mechanical or otherwise.</p>",

Tobacco use remains one of the most vexing challenges we face in the global health arena.</p> <p>I urge global leaders convening in India to see this moment as an opportunity to bend the course of public health history and commit to returning home with a renewed dedication to fully implement the WHO framework convention. To make the event effective, it is vital that governments recognise the inherent conflict between public health and the interests of the tobacco industry. Representatives from the latter should be completely excluded from government delegations. </p> <p>Every death from tobacco is an avoidable tragedy. It is our task to reverse the tide, effecting an irreversible decline in the number of such deaths.</p> <p>We need history to show us that the turning point in the tobacco epidemic is now. We know what to do and we know how to do it. We now need to ensure that every country moves forward and no one is left behind. Future generations depend on us.</p>",
  "<p>Hillary Clinton has a unique talent to make people viscerally angry. Just look at the footage from Trump rallies: supporters carry \u201c<a href=\"https://lyinhillarydoll.com/\">Lyin Hillary\u201d</a> dolls hung from miniature nooses, cry \u201cLock her up\u201d and \u201cHang her in the streets\u201d, and wear Trump That Bitch T-shirts. You could chalk this up to Trump\u2019s toxicity, but some of it also haunted the Democratic primaries, in the over-the-top depictions of Clinton as a cold-blooded murderer or criminal mastermind promulgated by the most fanatical <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/bernie-sanders\">Bernie Sanders</a> supporters.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Hillary\u2019s critics insist there is something wrong with her sexually</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>So why is it, exactly, that Clinton gets under our skin? We could blame it on sexism \u2013 personally, sexism is one of my favourite things to blame stuff on; I recommend it highly \u2013 and that would be correct. Still, that diagnosis is a little too blunt to really get at the problem. Women and men, left-wingers and right-wingers alike, all dissolve into spasms of rabid conspiracy theorising and ranting when Clinton\u2019s name comes up.</p> <p>I would argue that Clinton irritates people not just because of her gender, but because we simply can\u2019t process her narrative. There are no stories that prepare us for her trajectory through life and, therefore, we react to her as if she\u2019s a disruption in our reality, rather than a person. We love public women best when they are losers, when they\u2019re humiliated, defeated, or (in some instances) just plain killed. Yet Clinton, despite the disapproval that rains down on her, continues to go out there and chalk up wins.</p> <p>Aversion to successful or ambitious women is nothing new. It\u2019s baked into our cultural DNA. Consider the myth of <a href=\"http://www.theoi.com/Heroine/Atalanta.html\">Atalanta</a>. She was the fastest runner in her kingdom, forced men to race her for her hand, and defeated every one of them. She would have gotten away with it, too, if some man hadn\u2019t booby-trapped the course with apples to slow her down, which is presented as a happy ending. By taking away her ability to excel, he also takes away her loneliness.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a922734a8da356101e21532d7d953d39f82ce38f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a922734a8da356101e21532d7d953d39f82ce38f/1_0_2559_1536/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pushed to the edge: (clockwise from top left) Diana Spencer; Britney Spears; Marilyn Monroe; and Amy Winehouse.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pushed to the edge: (clockwise from top left) Diana Spencer; Britney Spears; Marilyn Monroe; and Amy Winehouse.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Composite: Karen Robinson; Getty; Rex</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Then, there\u2019s the story of <a href=\"https://people.ucsc.edu/~rosewood/writing/tales/orion.htm\">Artemis and Orion</a>: He\u2019s the most handsome hunter in all Greece, and she\u2019s the Virgin Goddess of the Hunt, who\u2019s ready to get rid of the \u201cvirgin\u201d portion for him. Until, that is, her jealous brother Apollo tricks her into an archery contest \u2013 she\u2019s so proud of her aim that she lets Apollo taunt her into shooting at a barely visible speck on the horizon and, therefore, winds up shooting her lover in the head.</p> <p>The lesson is clear, and has been reiterated in countless hacky comedies about cold, loveless career women ever since. Success and love are incompatible for women. For a woman, taking pride in her own talents \u2013 especially talents seen as \u201cmasculine\u201d \u2013 is a sin that will perpetually cut her off from human relationships and social acceptance. She can be good, or liked, not both. The only answer is to let a man beat her, thereby accepting her proper feminine role.</p> <p>It\u2019s no coincidence that the people who insist there\u2019s \u201cjust something\u201d off about Hillary Clinton as a politician are so eager to buy the idea there is something sexually wrong with her: frigidity (Hillary Sucks, But Not Like Monica, as per one popular T-shirt); or top-secret lesbianism (why is she so often photographed with political staffer <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2016/10/07/a-rare-look-inside-huma-abedins-relationship-with-hillary-clinton/\">Huma Abedin</a>?); or simply an Artemis-esque tendency to slaughter her boyfriends, as with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vince_Foster\">deputy White House counsel Vince Foster</a>, who conspiracy theorists have long claimed she had an affair with, then had him killed to keep him from revealing her dark secrets.</p> <p>Yet, though Clinton activates the darkest parts of her critics\u2019 sexual imagination, our yearning for her downfall goes beyond even that. It\u2019s not just that her success makes her unattractive or \u201cunlikable\u201d, it\u2019s that, on some level, we cannot believe her success even exists.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2a8d3505d985e7f87bde336e6fa371b40c305556\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2a8d3505d985e7f87bde336e6fa371b40c305556/0_754_5291_3176/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018We loathe and mock addicted women until the day they die\u2019: Amy Winehouse.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018We loathe and mock addicted women until the day they die\u2019: Amy Winehouse.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Karen Robinson/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>You hear that disbelief in the frantic insistence of certain Sanders supporters that the primary was \u201crigged\u201d, simply because Clinton won it. You hear it when Trump sputters that Clinton \u201cshould never have been allowed to run\u201d, making her very presence in the race a violation of the accepted order. You can hear it when pundits such as <a href=\"http://pavementpieces.com/author/jwalczak/\">Jonathan Walczak</a> argue that even if Clinton is elected, she should voluntarily resign after one term \u201cfor her own good\u201d. (Also, presumably, good for George Clooney, whom Walczak offers up as a plausible replacement.) Even when we imagine her winning, we can\u2019t imagine her really winning. Unadulterated female success and power, on the level Clinton has experienced, is simply not in our shared playbook. So, even when a Clinton victory is right in front of our eyes, we react, not as if it\u2019s undesirable, but as if it is simply not real. And the thing is, it might not be. Or at least, it might only be temporary: the rise before the big, spectacular, sexism-affirming fall.</p> <p>When I wrote my book, <em>Trainwreck</em>, I was interested in how our culture treats failed women. The answer is that we rarely allow women to be anything else. From the moment a woman arrives in the public eye, we scrutinise her for signs of deviant sexuality, out-of-control emotions, or both. Not surprisingly, when put under constant surveillance and deprived of meaningful privacy, most people eventually reveal human flaws. Which we then broadcast and publicise \u2013 the nip slip, the up-skirt, the broken engagement, the drinking binge \u2013 until the flaws become more famous than the woman herself, until they come to define and contain her, and render her a trainwreck.</p> <p>We don\u2019t just want women to fail, we need it. Female failure is a live demonstration of all our stereotypes about female weakness, and a confirmation of all our old prejudices against women entering the public sphere. When I say old, I mean Paleolithic \u2013 injunctions against female self-expression or fame are everywhere in ancient history. The Christian New Testament \u201c[suffers] not a woman to teach, nor to usurp authority over the man;\u201d Pericles wrote that the greatest womanly virtue was \u201cnot to be talked of for good or evil among men\u201d. In the colonial United States and Britain, women who talked too much and started fights were labelled \u201ccommon scolds\u201d \u2013 recommended punishments included making them wear gags or repeatedly dunking them in water to simulate drowning.</p> <p>Nowadays, we can\u2019t literally outlaw the act of women becoming visible, successful or famous. But we still punish the women who do \u2013 by turning their very visibility against them, and making their time in the public eye a reputation destroying misery. The more successful a woman is, the more pleasure we take in demolishing her and turning her into a two-dimensional villain. Hillary Clinton\u2019s extraordinary success may only be tempting the God of Trainwrecks to make her our biggest and best catastrophe yet.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"58ea4532a37010207ec3b3c340ba11945891f581\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/58ea4532a37010207ec3b3c340ba11945891f581/414_538_2766_1659/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A supporter holds up a sign as Trump rallies in Tallahassee, Florida\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Playing dirty: a pro-Trump supporter holds up a sign in Florida.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jonathan Ernst/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>If elected, Clinton would not be the first or only female head of state in the world. As the existence of Germany\u2019s Angela Merkel shows, it is possible for female leaders to get along \u2014 with a practiced dullness that prevents them from attracting too much of the limelight and, therefore, too much public rage. But Clinton\u2019s presidency is not likely to follow those patterns. For a look at how her time in the Oval Office might go, and how it might go wrong, we\u2019d do best to look at the fate of Australian Prime Minister <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/julia-gillard\">Julia Gillard</a>.</p> <p>Gillard, too, was the first woman of her kind \u2013 at least as far as her home country was concerned. And Gillard, too, was greeted with a tremendous amount of resentment, even hatred, when she made it to the top. Most notoriously, conservatives held a fundraising dinner with \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jun/12/menu-quail-julia-gillard-liberal\">Julia Gillard Kentucky Fried Quail</a>\u201d on the menu. It featured \u201cSmall breasts, huge thighs and a big red box.\u201d (The same joke has been repurposed at Trump rallies: the \u201cKFC Hillary Special\u201d contains \u201cTwo fat thighs, two small breasts\u2026 left wing.\u201d Look, no one ever said sexists were a laugh riot.)</p> <p>Gillard\u2019s response, initially, was to ignore all this, and attempt to rise above it: \u201cMy essential view was that it was because I\u2019m the first woman, I\u2019m unusual, and it will wash itself out of the system,\u201d she said. This attempt at nobility was her fatal flaw. Without resistance, the sexism escalated to epic proportions. \u201cDitch the Witch\u201d signs were distributed, pornographic cartoons of her circulated online, and her childless status became a national topic, with some commentators alleging she\u2019d rendered herself \u201cdeliberately barren\u201d. Meanwhile, her political rivals whipped up false charges of corruption \u2013 widely regarded now as sheer political calculation \u2013 and began calling her \u201cJu-Liar Gillard\u201d. She responded to some of this in a speech about her experience with sexism that went viral, but it wasn\u2019t enough \u2013 by that time, the trainwreck narrative had firmly taken hold and the speech only made things worse, with rivals declaring she had \u201cdemeaned every woman in [the] parliament\u201d by \u201cplaying the gender card\u201d. Within three years, her own party had ousted her from office, and Gillard not only resigned as prime minister, but left politics for good.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Gillard failed and provided us with the spectacular flameout we all wanted</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2cb244e1e8a8432a778960f2cd74d5406f5e831f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2cb244e1e8a8432a778960f2cd74d5406f5e831f/0_139_4256_2554/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tony Abbott speaking at a rally with a banner behind him saying \"JuLiar Bob Browns BITCH'\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gender gains: Australian opposition leader Tony Abbott campaigning against Julia Gillard.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alan Porritt/AAP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Gillard, in other words, provided us with the spectacular flameout we were looking for. She failed publicly and therefore affirmed that female success and ambition would always rebound on the woman in question, and ruin her life. Of course, these kinds of humiliation aren\u2019t inevitable. They\u2019re consciously inflicted by sexist people on female targets. But the illusion of inevitability comforts us. Witness: as soon as Gillard had been publicly demolished to the point she could not recover, people started liking her.</p> <p>It\u2019s this, the tendency to hate women when they\u2019re up and love them when they\u2019re down, which is the most perverse feature of trainwreck culture and our aversion to female success. Often, with the true centrepieces of trainwreck media \u2013 mentally ill or addicted women, like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/amywinehouse\">Amy Winehouse</a> or Marilyn Monroe \u2013 we loathe and mock them until the very day they die, then transform them into beloved angels and martyrs after their deaths. Alive, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/diana\">Diana, Princess of Wales</a> was a tabloid fixture, a madwoman who featured in stories about throwing up all her food and driving through Paris in only her underpants. Dead, she was England\u2019s Rose.</p> <p>Clinton may not have to go quite that far to win us over. But she fits the pattern. Over and over, we embrace her once we think she\u2019s down for the count. When Bill Clinton\u2019s affair with Monica Lewinsky was revealed \u2013 making Hillary appear before the nation as the betrayed and humiliated \u201clittle woman\u201d she\u2019d infamously sworn never to be \u2013 her approval ratings soared, from 42 to 64%. When she ran against Barack Obama in the 2008 Democratic primary, people hated her even more feverishly than they do now, yet when he beat her, and she accepted a subordinate position in his administration, she became one of the US\u2019s most popular politicians.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"545b029b839cdba81ca5e0806f80a2b5846bcba4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/545b029b839cdba81ca5e0806f80a2b5846bcba4/0_34_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Julia Gillard in a public forum, smiling and with her hand raised\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018As soon as Julia Gillard had been publicly demolished to the point she could not recover, people started liking her.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Spencer Platt/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>So why does Hillary still get up and apply for the big jobs? Why, when she could so easily garner our love by accepting humiliation and a role in the background, does she persist in stepping forward and aiming for what she wants? All she has to do is let a man beat her \u2013 any man; her husband, a political opponent, anyone \u2013 and she can be loved again. Why does she insist on winning?</p> <p>It\u2019s a feverish gender-politics Catch-22. If Clinton gives up and lets herself be beaten, she\u2019ll experience less sexism which will, in and of itself, be proof of sexism. If she continues being openly, visibly successful, she\u2019ll experience more sexism, but the very fact of her success will demonstrate that sexism is less powerful than we thought.</p> <p>Given the option, Clinton has apparently chosen the harder road \u2013 to keep warping the narrative, keep challenging the idea that disreputable women always end in ruin and wreck and flame. She still may, of course \u2013 there are many, many people rooting for her to fall. But there is something profoundly admirable to how she keeps plugging ahead, looking to provide the world with a new kind of story.</p> <p>Trainwreck<em> by Sady Doyle is published by Melville House at \u00a318.99.

  "<p>The fans in the Matthew Harding Stand spent the second half bellowing Antonio Conte\u2019s name, making it perfectly clear that they have a new hero at Stamford Bridge, and Chelsea were so dominant they could even afford to give one of their reserve centre-backs a brief cameo towards the end of this ruthless evisceration of Everton. John Terry enjoyed a suitably warm reception from the locals as he ran on and the club captain\u2019s reduced role was a reminder that Chelsea are quickly building a new identity under the manager who has breathed fresh life into a side that improbably flirted with a relegation battle a year ago.</p> <p>They never quite got over Jos\u00e9 Mourinho when his first spell in charge came to a bitter end nine years ago. This time, however, nobody at Chelsea is pining for Mourinho.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2016/nov/05/chelsea-v-everton-premier-league-live\">Chelsea 5-0 Everton: Premier League \u2013\u00a0as it happened</a> </p> </aside>  <p>For all that these remain early days, they will challenge for the title if they continue to hit these heights. While Ronald Koeman was critical of Everton\u2019s failure to match their opponents\u2019 aggression in those crucial early stages when the game slipped from their grasp, he spoke admiringly of the winning mentality that Chelsea are developing under Conte.</p> <p>Nothing epitomises their resurgence more than the way that Diego Costa and Eden Hazard have rediscovered their zip and poise after drifting aimlessly through last season. Costa took revenge for a dangerous early tackle from S\u00e9amus Coleman that left him with a bloody right ankle and an even bigger scowl than usual by pulverising Everton\u2019s ragged defence, while Hazard had a hand in all five of Chelsea\u2019s goals and scored twice, taking his tally to seven from his first 11 league matches.</p> <p>Conte insisted that it is not important that Chelsea\u2019s victory lifted them to the Premier League\u2019s summit, pointing out that Arsenal and Liverpool have opportunities to overtake them on Sunday. Yet any side that puts together a run of five consecutive wins and clean sheets should not be underestimated. \u201cFantastica,\u201d Conte said when he was asked to sum up Chelsea\u2019s performance with an Italian word.</p> <p>Chelsea have certainly come a long way since their thrashing by Arsenal at the end of September, when the talk was of crisis and a side that would struggle to qualify for the Champions League. Conte had seen enough after that humiliation in north London, switching to a 3-4-3 system, and it has not taken long for Chelsea to feel the benefits of the Italian\u2019s proactive repair job.</p> <p>\u201cI have never seen a team so strong playing this system,\u201d Koeman said. \u201cThe movements of Hazard and Costa, it is difficult.\u201d</p> <p>Everton\u2019s manager flattered Conte with an imitation of his system, Phil Jagielka\u2019s return to the side allowing the visitors to line up with three centre-backs, but his ploy had no effect. Nine minutes before half-time, Koeman ditched Plan A and brought on Kevin Mirallas for Bryan Oviedo. Six minutes later, Costa scored Chelsea\u2019s third, finishing confidently after Nemanja Matic flicked on Hazard\u2019s corner.</p> <p>Chelsea have made a habit of blowing their opponents away with blistering starts in recent weeks and they took control of the game inside the first 20 minutes thanks to two moments of brilliance from Hazard. Everton had started with intent, the fireworks that lit up the darkening sky in west London before kick-off matched by the sparks that flew on the pitch when Coleman\u2019s studs raked Costa\u2019s right ankle. Blood seeped through Costa\u2019s sock and the Everton defender somehow got away with it, although he might have preferred an early bath given how the match unfolded.</p> <p>The punishment began in the 19th minute. Missing the calming touches of the suspended Idrissa Gueye, Everton\u2019s midfield was overwhelmed by Matic and N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9. Gareth Barry lost possession in the middle, Hazard broke down the left, beat Ashley Williams and aimed for the far corner, the unsighted Maarten Stekelenburg allowing the Belgian\u2019s crisp drive to beat his dive.</p> <p>There was barely time for Everton to gather their thoughts before Hazard was bursting clear again. Pedro rolled the ball across the area for Marcos Alonso, who slipped a low finish through Stekelenburg\u2019s legs for his first Chelsea goal. \u201cIf they get the space, they will kill that,\u201d Koeman said.</p> <p>A win would have lifted Everton into fifth place but they never troubled Thibaut Courtois. Romelu Lukaku fed off scraps against his former club and the Everton forward could only watch as Hazard ran riot at the other end, a slick exchange with Pedro creating the space for him to dart inside from the right and fire inside the near post.</p> <p>\u201cHe is playing great football,\u201d Conte said. \u201cThe most important thing is Eden is fantastic with the ball and without the ball.\u201d</p> <p>Chelsea refused to stop. Costa instigated another attack, turning superbly before finding Hazard. Stekelenburg saved his curling effort this time but Pedro scored on the rebound from close range.</p> <p>Celebrating wildly, Conte did not realise that the fans were singing his name until one of his assistants told him. He looked at the crowd, beamed and clenched his fist.</p>",
  "<p>In the unlikely event that Alan Bennett, playwright and national treasure, and Chris Ware, comic artist extraordinaire, were to collaborate \u2013 I suppose there\u2019s still time \u2013 the result might turn out a bit like the winner of the 2016 <em>Observer</em>/Jonathan Cape/Comica graphic short story prize. <em>Colin&#xa0;Turnbull: A Tall Story</em>, the charming and rather plangent tale of a man who longs only to win Lancashire\u2019s Tallest Milkman competition, took its creator, Matthew Dooley, only two weeks to draw. But you\u2019d never know it. Look beyond its slightly surreal humour \u2013 it pokes fun at the silly, overblown language of sport \u2013 and you\u2019ll see that it also pays quiet tribute to the now rapidly diminishing army of men (and women) who continue, against the financial odds, to deliver a daily pint to doorsteps everywhere. Even as it makes the reader laugh, then, it has the quality of an elegy, which is perhaps why it won this year in spite of some exceptionally tough competition.</p> <p>Dooley, who works for the parliamentary education service at the Palace of Westminster, doesn\u2019t have a background in art: he studied classics at university, and laughs that it might be \u201cpushing it\u201d to suggest the friezes on classical Greek buildings can be seen as an early form of cartoon strip. Nevertheless, he has been trying to win the <em>Observer</em>/Cape/Comica competition for a while. This is, in fact, his fifth attempt. \u201cI drew incessantly as a child,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I read Asterix, Tintin and <em>2000AD</em>. But when I was about 15 or 16, I stopped. I didn\u2019t come back to comics or to drawing until my 20s when \u2013 I don\u2019t suppose this is an unusual story \u2013 I discovered <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2004/aug/28/comics.politics\" title=\"\">Art Spiegelman</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/ng-interactive/2014/sep/13/-sp-chris-ware-the-last-saturday-graphic-novel\" title=\"\">Chris Ware</a>. After that, I started dabbling again, which was difficult at first because I was so out of practice. The first proper comic I ever drew was the first one I put in for in the <em>Observer</em> competition, which I\u2019ve entered four times before. But that worked for me: I need some kind of external pressure to get going.\u201d</p> <p>Is he thrilled to have won at last? \u201cOh, yes. I\u2019m pleased. But I\u2019m also very&#xa0;surprised.\u201d</p> <p>His idea wasn\u2019t a new one. \u201cYears ago, me and my friend, Chris, were knocking about ideas for sketches, and I had one for a milkman who was obsessed with being tall. I found it in an old notebook, and revived it: the combination of the mundane and the obsessive seemed like it would be just right for a comic. I set it in Lancashire, in a place like the one I grew up in: Ormskirk, which was quite bland and suburban\u2026 extraordinarily normal, I suppose you\u2019d say. I\u2019m a sports obsessive. I tend to live vicariously through the achievements of various sports people. But I do see that sport is inherently ridiculous, too.\u201d</p> <p>What about his drawings? The influence of Chris Ware seems obvious. \u201cOh, I wouldn\u2019t dispute that, except my hands must be a lot more wiggly than his. I really like Chris Ware, but I\u2019m not deliberately trying to be like him. I think I\u2019m still looking for my own style. Finding one that\u2019s completely my own is a work in progress.\u201d Dooley hopes that winning the competition will open doors for him, though he has already begun contributing to small-press anthologies. \u201cI\u2019d love to have a go at something longer, and I\u2019m very aware of past winners like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/nov/06/observer-graphic-short-story-prize-greenberg\" title=\"\">Isabel Greenberg</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/nov/07/observer-graphic-prize-stephen-collins\" title=\"\">Stephen Collins</a> [both bagged publishing deals with Jonathan Cape after winning], who are truly, truly brilliant.\u201d He also, of course, takes home \u00a31,000.</p> <p>This is the ninth year of the prize and the standard was as high as ever; among the stories\u2019 themes were the housing crisis and mass tourism on Mount Everest. The judges \u2013 our regular panel was joined this time by the cartoonist Steve Bell, and the novelist Sebastian Faulks \u2013 felt that half a dozen entries could ultimately have gone on to win, and certainly to be a runner-up. In the end, though, we gave the second prize to <em>Of Ice and Men</em>, a multilayered tale of global warming that comes with a ghastly (and topical) twist \u2013 the work of \u201cDoulos Nezblanc\u201d, better known as David Ross, a Zimbabwean-born former lawyer who now works in a London cinema. Exquisitely beautiful and thought-provoking, too, its final frame provoked explosive guffaws all around the judging table.</p> <p><em>An exhibition of the stories shortlisted for this year\u2019s competition can be seen at </em><a href=\"http://www.orbitalcomics.com/graphic-short-story-prize-competition-exhibition-and-winner-announcement/\" title=\"\"><em>Orbital Comics</em></a><em>, 8 Great Newport Street, London WC2, until 17 November </em></p>",

Man-ny! from the crowd. Another knockdown near the end of the round but again it\u2019s ruled a slip. A one-sided beating of a champion a decade his junior. Pacquiao, at 37, just may be the best active fighter in the welterweight division.<br></p> <p><strong>Guardian\u2019s unofficial score: Vargas 9-10 Pacquiao (Vargas 109-118 Pacquiao)</strong></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-581eb943e4b029b92ca45f5f\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-06T05:02:19.148Z\">5.02am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Round 11</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Pacquiao looking incredibly energized here. More in-and-out movement keeps Vargas off balance then a huge overhand right from Pacquiao. Vargas has slowed down a lot here. Pacquiao caught flush by Vargas while rushing in but he takes it well. Still, a scary moment. Pacquiao lands with a right near the end of the round and goes down, but the referee rules it a slip. It looks as if their feet were tangled but that easily could have been ruled a knockdown. Easy round for Pacquiao.<br></p> <p><strong>Guardian\u2019s unofficial score: Vargas 9-10 Pacquiao (Vargas 100-108 Pacquiao)</strong></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-11-06T05:04:42.445Z\">at 5.04am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-581eb84be4b0d073c27d1e98\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-06T04:58:33.804Z\">4.58am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Round 10</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Pacquiao looking comfortable now, countering at will, landing punches from all sorts of angles. A double hook, a straight left, an uppercut. He seems to have figured Vargas out completely. He\u2019s outlanding and outthrowing him. Vargas to his credit has shown no quit, it\u2019s just a different class of fighter before him.<br></p> <p><strong>Guardian\u2019s unofficial score: Vargas 9-10 Pacquiao (Vargas 91-98 Pacquiao)</strong></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-581eb75ee4b07ceadb3a2e21\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-06T04:53:59.206Z\">4.53am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Round 9</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Two hard overhand lefts by Pacquiao but Vargas is unbowed. He\u2019s still trying to win this fight, not simply exit the ring upright like so many previous Pacquiao opponents at this stage. Yet Pacquiao continues to frustrate Vargas and make him miss and he wins another round. Crucially, the Nevada State Athletic Commission has ruled the cut over Vargas\u2019 eye was caused by a punch. That means if the fight is stopped as a result of the cut, Pacquiao will be awarded the victory without going to the scorecards.<br></p> <p><strong>Guardian\u2019s unofficial score: Vargas 9-10 Pacquiao (Vargas 82-88 Pacquiao)</strong></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-581eb661e4b029b92ca45f56\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-06T04:49:51.988Z\">4.49am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Round 8</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Vargas connects with a massive straight right but Pacquiao fires back with a flurry of punches. A clash of heads but it appears to be accidental. Pacquaio really punishing Vargas here with blinding speed and now he\u2019s opened a cut above the champion\u2019s right eye. Clearly a Pacquiao round.<br></p> <p><strong>Guardian\u2019s unofficial score: Vargas 9-10 Pacquiao (Vargas 73-78 Pacquiao)</strong></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-581eb56de4b07ceadb3a2e1e\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-06T04:45:45.722Z\">4.45am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Round 7</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Better work from Pacquiao right out of the gate: a jab, a hook. An array of straight lefts. He\u2019s picking up the pace and scoring with accuracy. A clear round for Pacquiao. When he\u2019s active, he\u2019s clearly the better fighter. When he sits back, he allows Vargas to control the pace and the action.<br></p> <p><strong>Guardian\u2019s unofficial score: Vargas 9-10 Pacquiao (Vargas 64-68 Pacquiao)</strong></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-581eb495e4b029b92ca45f53\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-06T04:42:18.594Z\">4.42am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Round 6</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Pacquiao connects with a left hand and Vargas is showing a lot of swelling on the right side of his face, but he responds with a hard right that catches Pacquiao flush! Now another right by Vargas! It\u2019s only taken him half the fight but he\u2019s finally found range with it. He\u2019s controlling distance a bit better and on our card he\u2019s won his second round in a row.<br></p> <p><strong>Guardian\u2019s unofficial score: Vargas 10-9 Pacquiao (Vargas 55-58 Pacquiao)</strong></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-581eb3ade4b07ceadb3a2e1a\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-06T04:38:39.251Z\">4.38am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Round 5</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Good straight left by Pacquiao but it doesn\u2019t seem to affect Vargas, who now is ramping up the aggression. He barrels forward and throws a series of punches. None seem to connect with substance but it\u2019s better than waiting for Pacquiao to bring the action. Pacquiao landing punches here and there but Vargas looking more confidence and returning when he can. The closest round yet and Vargas has really managed to keep it on even terms, just enough to nick it.<br></p> <p><strong>Guardian\u2019s unofficial score: Vargas 10-9 Pacquiao (Vargas 45-49 Pacquiao)</strong></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-581eb1fbe4b029b92ca45f4c\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-06T04:34:06.588Z\">4.34am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Round 4</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Vargas just looks slower and he\u2019s expended a lot of energy simply keeping Pacquiao at bay, so it\u2019s a problem that won\u2019t resolve itself. He lands a nice right early on but continues to miss wildly with the left hook. The constant in-and-out, herky-jerky movement of the challenger is just too much to keep up with. Another good right by Vargas near the bell. That was his best round but I\u2019ve still got to tip it to Pacquiao.<br></p> <p><strong>Guardian\u2019s unofficial score: Vargas 9-10 Pacquiao (Vargas 35-40 Pacquiao)</strong></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-581eb19ae4b07ceadb3a2e16\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-06T04:29:39.524Z\">4.29am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Round 3</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Vargas rattled here and Pacquiao starts to open with combinations. A flurry of punches moves Vargas back but he stays on his feet. Oh and Manny is really letting his hands go now: punches in bunches from all angles. Now the crowd is chanting: Man-ny! Man-ny! Pacquiao warned for a low blow. Vargas connects with a stinging shot near the end of the round, perhaps his best shot of the fight, but it\u2019s not enough to take the third. Pacquiao sure doesn\u2019t look like the fighter who is 10 years older.<br></p> <p><strong>Guardian\u2019s unofficial score: Vargas 9-10 Pacquiao (Vargas 26-30 Pacquiao)</strong></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-581eb07ce4b0d073c27d1e86\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-06T04:24:39.390Z\">4.24am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Round 2</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Vargas opening up more here with a few tenatative combinations but failing to connect with anything substantive.

But he looked in fine form against the outstanding Bradley, scoring two knockdowns, and is widely expected to prevail here tonight.

  "<p>Ivo van Hove is everywhere: his production of <em>Lazarus</em> \u2013 David Bowie\u2019s swansong musical, which in New York sold out within hours of tickets being available at the box office, has arrived in London. Van Hove\u2019s production of <a href=\"https://www.nationaltheatre.org.uk/shows/hedda-gabler\"><em>Hedda Gabler</em>, starring Ruth Wilson</a>, is to be a highlight of the National Theatre\u2019s new season. He is bringing several pieces to the Barbican with his theatre company, <a href=\"http://blog.barbican.org.uk/2016/05/the-toneelgroep-amsterdam-2017-residency/\">Toneelgroep Amsterdam</a>, including a double bill based on Ingmar Bergman films, a reprise of his <a href=\"https://www.barbican.org.uk/theatre/event-detail.asp?ID=19668\"><em>Roman Tragedies</em></a> and an adaptation of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/may/10/jude-law-returns-london-stage-barbican-ivo-van-hove-obsession-play-theatre\">Visconti\u2019s film <em>Obsession</em> which will star Jude Law</a>. Multitasking must be second nature, I think, as I catch sight of him, striding into London\u2019s Jerwood Space, in perfect time for our meeting.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Bowie was a very quiet man. A real English gentleman, a serious artist\u2026 He never used his power, he was collaborative</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Dressed in a navy, double-breasted overcoat, Van Hove is, at 58, tall, lean and clean-shaven with a non-experimental look. Ask the unenlightened to imagine what his career might be and no one would guess avant-garde theatre director. He could pass as the lawyer he once intended to become. Born in Heist-op-den-Berg, in rural Belgium, he now lives in Amsterdam. His company travels the world and his productions excite rave notices, occasional dissenters, strong opinions. All his shows \u2013 including Juliet Binoche\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/mar/08/antigone-review-juliette-binoche-is-more-hysteric-than-heroine\"><em>Antigone</em></a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2013/dec/24/best-theatre-of-2013-no-6-scenes-from-a-marriage\"><em>Scenes from a Marriage</em></a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/apr/13/a-view-from-the-bridge-review-miller-mark-strong\"><em>A View from the Bridge</em></a><em> </em>(for which he won an Olivier for best director) \u2013 are designed by his partner (in life and work) of more than 30 years, Jan Versweyveld. They share a daring, immaculate, less-is-more style: subtraction is their way of laying drama bare. Sometimes literally \u2013 their legendary 1998 <em>Streetcar</em> involved full-frontal nudity and was organised around a claw-footed bathtub.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/oct/21/david-bowie-lazarus-video-michael-c-hall\">Michael C Hall performs David Bowie's Lazarus \u2013 video</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Van Hove\u2019s decision about where we are to sit in the empty cafe is swift. An unimportant decision yet there is no mistaking the reflexes of an autocrat \u2013 he is every inch a director. Accompanying this impression, I have a suspicion that he expects, at any moment, to be irritated. When answering questions, he has a long-suffering air, as if one were about to throw dust in his eyes or otherwise impede the progress of his day. He is at his most likable when he hesitates, seeming to dig deeper, as if waiting for a truth to be revealed.</p> <p><strong>How much was David Bowie involved in your production of <em>Lazarus</em>?</strong><br>He was very involved: it was his life-long dream to put on what he called \u201ca play with my music\u201d. He got in touch with the producer Robert Fox \u2013 who was an old friend of his \u2013 and then the writer Enda Walsh spent a few days with him in New York talking about the story [a sequel to Walter Tevis\u2019s novel <em>The Man Who Fell to Earth</em>]. David made a selection of 60-70 songs. Then they told Robert: \u201cNow we need a director.\u201d They did not want a conventional director or a big Broadway musical, they wanted something innovative and Robert Fox said: \u201cI have Ivo here.\u201d</p> <p><strong>What was Bowie like to work with? One thinks of him as a theatre in himself\u2026</strong><br>Not at all \u2013 he was a very quiet man. A real English gentleman, a serious artist. I\u2019ve always been a fan [Van Hove used Bowie\u2019s song The Motel for his<em> Angels in America</em>]. After Bowie became sick, we had a camera installed during workshops, so he could follow. Every day, he\u2019d call me to say: \u201cWow, this is great\u201d, or: \u201cI think you should think about this\u201d. And what was a happy surprise was that he never used his power, he was collaborative. He had strong but constructive opinions.</p> <p><strong>Perhaps it was good for him in his last months to be working on such a project?</strong><br>It is clear from his album <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jan/10/david-bowie-blackstar-review-jazz-group\"><em>Blackstar</em></a><em> </em>that it was a creative period. He wanted these things [play and album] to happen, they were very important to him.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video element--supporting\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/video/2016/jan/11/lazarus-david-bowie-blackstar-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/4fy6c\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2436492\"            data-video-name=\"Lazarus, from David Bowie's last album, Blackstar \u2013\u00a0video\"            data-video-provider=\"ISO Records, Columbia Records and Sony Music Entertainment\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-56938c65e4b0f2d1f22c6e0c\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/01/11/160111bowie_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/01/11/160111bowie_synd_768k_vp8.webm\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2016/01/11/160111bowie_small.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/01/11/160111bowie.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2016/01/11/160111bowie_large.3gp\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/video/2016/jan/11/lazarus-david-bowie-blackstar-video\">Watch the video for Lazarus, from David Bowie\u2019s last album, Blackstar.</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p><strong>You must miss him. Does the musical now feel like a homage?</strong><br>I do miss him. It is clear. But listen, I don\u2019t want to pretend we were friends. I never was at his home. And the show has not become a homage, that was never my intention. But I do think the show will make even more sense now than it ever has.</p> <p><strong>That is interesting because <em>Lazarus</em> was described in the <em>Guardian</em> as \u201cthrilling\u201d but \u201cincomprehensible\u201d? Is there anything you don\u2019t understand about it yourself?</strong><br>There is nothing I don\u2019t understand. I immediately got the sense of it as an existentialist play about a man who is living dead, in eternal mourning for the love of his life, wondering how to make sense of it all. It was not so distant from Bergman who, although totally different from Bowie, is also asking about existence.</p> <p><strong>The last line of Bowie\u2019s album <em>Blackstar </em>is: \u201cI can\u2019t give everything away.\u201d Do you worry about giving your all and about giving too much away?</strong><br>I give it all as Bowie gave it all \u2013 in a masked way. I have called my productions masked autobiographies. They say something about how I feel, what I am afraid of, what I am hoping for \u2013 utopia, lost paradises \u2013 that is what my productions are about. So this is a very personal production but I cannot give it all away.</p> <p><strong>You are known for your extremely physical, challenging, hands-on direction. Yet you seem aloof \u2013 reserved. Do you change when you go into the rehearsal room?</strong><br>I\u2019m the same person. Listen, how to say this? I\u2019ve just come from a Skype meeting, planning next season, and was behaving differently from the way I\u2019m behaving with you now. And when I go into a rehearsal room, my philosophy is that once you close the door, everything is allowed because you are living in an imaginary world. You are playing \u2013 yet it is serious. A play needs to entertain but also do more, it must go deeper. In that room, every fantasy is allowed. Exploration is what good actors are interested in, they don\u2019t want to spend their lives in their comfort zone.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d09e8abe1b0d42551126eeb20155d6460195404b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d09e8abe1b0d42551126eeb20155d6460195404b/0_0_1500_901/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Michael C Hall and Sophia Anne Caruso in Lazarus\" width=\"1000\" height=\"601\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Michael C Hall and Sophia Anne Caruso in Lazarus.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Johan Persson</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>You trained as a lawyer. What made you jump tracks?</strong><br>The seed was planted when I was young. When I was 11, I was sent to an old-fashioned Belgian boarding school of 800 boys. On Wednesday afternoons, there were no lessons. There were beautiful football fields but I didn\u2019t choose to play in them. You were allowed to go into the small town for the girls, which I also did not do. Impulsively, I joined a theatre group. There was no reason to choose theatre in that I did not come from an artistic background \u2013 my father was a pharmacist, my mother a housewife. I made a choice, I don\u2019t know why \u2013 that is the miracle of life. And I very quickly discovered the warmth of theatre. At boarding school, it was all walls \u2013 you couldn\u2019t get out. Boarding school was a world within a world and this theatre group was a world within that world, within the big world outside. I discovered the warmth of creating something together that no one else knew about. And then, at the end of the school term, we put on our production and got applause for it. But it was not the applause that interested me so much as the secrecy and warmth.</p> <p><strong>Does your working marriage with your set designer, Jan Versweyveld, ever get too close for comfort?</strong><br>No \u2013 although we have our ups and downs. I can illustrate this with a story. Dora van der Groen, the most famous of Belgian actresses \u2013 our equivalent to Sarah Bernhardt \u2013 was in love with one of my first productions, <em>Agatha</em>, by Marguerite Duras. We became friends. She said: \u201cIvo, between you and theatre it is a very good marriage.\u201d The bad times should not destroy the good. He and I are good at enjoying the good times and not allowing ourselves to be crushed by the bad. We are together in stress but also in joy.</p> <p><strong>You have been called by the <em>New York Times </em>critic Ben Brantley a \u201cmaximalist minimalist\u201d \u2013 does he have that right?</strong><br>I can\u2019t improve on that.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"b9fa768db61aa1c165690ab5f4bb4eead75b0159\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b9fa768db61aa1c165690ab5f4bb4eead75b0159/0_120_1240_1549/801.jpg\" alt=\"Ruth Wilson, who is playing the title role in Ivo van Hove\u2019s new production of Hedda Gabler at the National theatre next month.\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ruth Wilson, who is playing the title role in Ivo van Hove\u2019s new production of Hedda Gabler at the National theatre next month.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lea Nielsen</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Is being faithful to a text important?</strong><br>I don\u2019t know what \u201cbeing faithful to a text\u201d means. There\u2019s not one truth. As a director or actor, you have to give an interpretation of a line. I get 10 different people to say \u201cI love you\u201d \u2013 three words, an objective truth \u2013 and yet each time it is spoken it is different. I\u2019m known for my preparation. For actors, this is not a threat, it is freedom. I like to create the world in which the text will blossom best.</p> <p><strong>You directed <em>Hedda Gabler</em> in 2004 and won an Obie. Why return to it?</strong><br>I like sometimes to revisit. This National Theatre production will be conceptually the same but have a London flavour. Ruth [Wilson] and I have been talking about Hedda. What is brilliant is that Ibsen, writing over a century ago, saw so clearly. Hedda is a frustrated housewife but different from Nora in <em>A Doll\u2019s House</em>. Nora becomes clear in her choices, Hedda remains enigmatic. Ruth and I have to answer the \u201cwhy\u201d but not reveal it. And we have found something which I could show you from the text but will not do so\u2026</p> <p><strong>What are the advantages of being artistic director of your own theatre company? How do you cope with crazy overload?</strong><br>I sleep seven hours a night. I call the group, which regularly visits the Barbican, my laboratory on a large scale. I have 21 fully employed actors and we play all over the world in Dutch \u2013 often four hours with subtitles, and people stay. We can make a difference in the world, actors are still celebrated.</p> <p><strong>Your range of work seems eclectic: Shakespeare, Sophocles, Arthur Miller, Tony Kushner, E Annie Proulx\u2026</strong><br>I\u2019m not eclectic. I\u2019m interested in two basic things. Our existence, as in <em>Lazarus</em>. Why are we here? Can we make sense of it? We could commit suicide. Why don\u2019t we? And then I am interested in politics but only in the Greek way \u2013 <em>polis</em> meaning society. After 9/11, it became more important to deal with huge texts. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/may/01/kings-of-war-shakespeare-toneelgroep-barbican\"><em>Kings of War</em></a> involved thinking about leadership, the issue of this and the next decades.

We\u2019re used to plays being turned into film, what are the challenges of going in the opposite direction?</strong><br>It is two different languages. I made movies [<em>Thuisfront</em> for Dutch TV and <em>Amsterdam</em> in 2009]. With movies, every day is the premiere. In a movie, you are god of creation and, at the end, make the edit. I still remember an off day after which I assumed the work would be unusable. It turned into the best scene in the film. That could never happen in the theatre. Turning film into theatre is a huge challenge \u2013 it is like being the first ever director of <em>Hamlet</em>. I have to establish a theatrical world, a world premiere. I do it because movies have an extremity I\u2019ve rarely found in theatre. I\u2019m doing <em>Obsession</em> with three English and three English-speaking Dutch actors. I wanted Jude Law, who was shooting in Rome. When we met, I impulsively thought of <em>Obsession</em>. And it was immediately clear he wanted to work with me. He read <em>Obsession</em> and really liked it \u2013 it is visceral...</p> <p><strong>You\u2019ve had audiences at the edges of the stage and even mingling with actors. Is the relationship with audiences something you think a lot about?</strong><br>Some people say theatre will not survive the 21st century, I say it will be <em>the</em> art form. Why? Because it is live. It is a world of magic, so-called. Theatre is a venue and we can do whatever we want in it. If you don\u2019t want to take risks, don\u2019t be in the theatre. The same, perhaps, is true of life.</p> <p><a href=\"https://lazarusmusical.com/\"><em>Lazarus is at King\u2019s Cross Theatre South</em></a><em>, London N1, until 22 January; </em><a href=\"https://www.nationaltheatre.org.uk/shows/hedda-gabler?gclid=CPvO-t_AjNACFawp0wod2ScCkw\"><em>Hedda Gabler is at the National theatre</em></a><em>, London SE1, from 5 December</em></p>",

The first chapter introduces us to Dong-ho, a 15-year-old schoolboy around whom later episodes orbit. He\u2019s searching anxiously for his friend Jeong-dae among the savagely mutilated dead bodies that are piling up in a gymnasium being used by demonstrators as a makeshift mortuary. Han describes minutely (and overwhelmingly) the grim sights and smells as Dong-ho joins the volunteers tending to the dead.</p> <p>Later chapters unfold over subsequent decades and follow the uprising\u2019s traumatised survivors, including a book editor hassled by censors for publishing the text of a topical play and a jailed protester recalling his experience of starvation. Han writes in the first person, the second and the third; one segment is narrated by a dead boy\u2019s soul, floating over his own body, describing the exercise regime he won\u2019t be able to follow and the girls he\u2019ll never meet. Some particularly horrific passages describe the torture that a woman finds herself unable to recount when she\u2019s interviewed by an academic about her memory of the protests.</p> <p>The final section follows \u201cthe writer\u201d, who, as a child, overheard grownups whispering about the violence. In adulthood, she\u2019s compelled to research the massacres and pay tribute to the victims. How best to do that is the problem this challenging novel confronts. If Han\u2019s in-your-face description of maimed and wounded bodies is partly a way to militate against forgetting or covering-up of the kind \u201cthe writer\u201d discovers on a visit to Gwangju in 2013, it also has surprising local effects. When, late in the novel, long after Dong-ho\u2019s death, his mother recalls his sour-smelling puke and the \u201cstrangely sweetish scent\u201d of his nappies as a baby, the contrast is poignant.</p> <p><em>Human Acts is published by Portobello (\u00a38.99). </em><a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/human-acts-451135.html\" title=\"\"><em>Click here to buy it for \u00a37.37</em></a></p>",
  "<p>When Sidhant Pai visited a local rubbish dump in his home city of Pune, India, he was struck by the size and intensity of the operation. Large black crows swooping overhead, roaming pigs, overwhelming odours and groups of waste pickers collecting plastic bottles in large white sacks. </p> <p>There are an estimated <a href=\"http://www.innovationseeds.eu/Network-Library/Core-Articles/Global-Alliance-Of-Waste-Pickers.kl\">15 million people</a> globally who currently make their living from waste picking and many earn less than a dollar a day. A key problem, says environmental engineer Pai, is that workers only capture a tiny proportion of the value of the waste they collect, separate and transport to scrap dealers.</p> <p>Together with his parents, Suchismita and Jayant Pai, he founded social enterprise Protoprint in 2012, one of a number of organisations trying to address the twin issues of poor conditions for waste pickers and plastic waste pollution. More than<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jan/24/plastic-new-epoch-human-damage\"> </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jan/24/plastic-new-epoch-human-damage\">300m tonnes of plastic</a> are produced globally every year, with much ending up in the ocean (one <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/19/more-plastic-than-fish-in-the-sea-by-2050-warns-ellen-macarthur\">refuse truck\u2019s worth every minute</a>), in landfill, or on city streets.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QE1uHxIzU5E\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/QE1uHxIzU5E?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>ProtoPrint video</figcaption> </figure>   <p>\u201cOur focus was on looking into different ways to add value to the waste, we were agnostic about the specific product,\u201d Pai says. After experimenting with making a few different products, Protoprint settled on making the plastic filament \u2013 the \u201cink\u201d \u2013\u00ad for 3D printers. \u201cIt added a tremendous amount of value to the waste plastic while still being relatively simple to manufacture at the dump.\u201d</p> <p>Protoprint partnered with SWaCH, a Pune-based cooperative wholly owned by waste pickers. Together they have set up a low-cost filament production facility at a local rubbish dump in Pune operated by SWaCH waste pickers to convert plastic waste \u2013 specifically high-density polyethylene (HPDE) mostly used for plastic bottles \u2013 into 3D printing filament to eventually be sold to Indian or international 3D printing companies.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"1cc6fd79b3eac1c0ebe5a574f23fed3c85b8c5f9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1cc6fd79b3eac1c0ebe5a574f23fed3c85b8c5f9/0_0_1328_720/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Protoprint waste pickers\" width=\"1000\" height=\"542\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Protoprint waste pickers.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Protoprint</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Protoprint buys filament from SwaCH for 300 rupees (\u00a33.50) per kg \u2013 if waste pickers sold the plastic waste directly to scrap merchants the pickers would receive around 19 rupees (23p) per kg, says Pai. \u201cAfter factoring in the costs of production and the various other expenses, there is still a six to eight times multiplier per kilogram of filament,\u201d he says.</p> <p>The market for filament, the majority of which is made from virgin plastic, is growing rapidly. A <a href=\"http://www.marketsandmarkets.com/PressReleases/3d-printing-materials.asp\">report</a> by a leading markets analyst predicted the 3D printing materials market would grow by nearly 266% over the next five years, to be worth \u00a31.07bn by 2021. </p> <p>However, most of it is expensive because of production and export costs, says William Hoyle, CEO of <a href=\"http://www.techfortrade.org/\">TechforTrade</a>. The British charity is working to promote and standardise an ethical way for filament to be made from the plastic collected by waste collectors. <br></p> <p>Ethical filament will be cheaper to buy than commercial filament, Hoyle says, because waste plastic is free resource and production costs are lower in developing countries.<br></p> <p>\u201cThe ethical filament standard is an open standard,\u201d says Hoyle. \u201cWe see the certification process happening in two ways. First, the social, environmental and economic assessment would be done by the waste collection organisation ... Second, the technical quality standard will be assessed by an independent third party and we are in discussion with a specialist assessor that will undertake this task.\u201d</p> <p>Amsterdam-based ReFlow, a social enterprise based in the Netherlands, works with one of TechforTrade\u2019s printing partners in Tanzania, STICLab, on a pilot project in Dar es Salaam.</p> <p>Co-founder Jasper Middendorp compares the potential of 3D printing to the development of mobile banking or solar in Africa, both of which flourished because infrastructure was broken. </p> <p>\u201cTanzania is highly import dependent and has very little of its own production infrastructure,\u201d he says, and 3D printing decentralises production without a huge capital expense or a great deal of specialised knowledge. This, he says, helps \u201cmake countries more self-sufficient instead of importing products from abroad that may not be suited to the local context\u201d.</p> <p>Previously supported by seed funding and the founders\u2019 own money, ReFlow has just closed off a Kickstarter campaign, raising \u20ac26,000 (\u00a323,000) and plans to launch the product in Amsterdam in February 2017. However, it is still working on quality control. \u201cWe haven\u2019t produced market quality filament yet,\u201d says Middendorp, \u201cbut we are hoping to do so within a month.\u201d </p> <p>The quality of the filament made from recycled waste plastic is a challenge for the whole 3D printing industry, says Pai.

Much of the recycled filament is destined for \u201cthe open source market for low-end products,\u201d he says, \u201cthey may not look glamorous but they are still functional products that can be used in development contexts\u201d.</p> <p>The greatest potential 3D printing offers the developing world is not for the products made, but for \u201cputting the means of production into the hands of the local people\u201d, says Jeremy Faludi, a sustainable design strategy consultant and teacher at the Minneapolis College of Art and Design. The market for ethical filament is a small one, he adds, but \u201cif the quality can match virgin filament at a similar price point, then it can be a large market.

  "<p>The placebo effect remains one of the most baffling mysteries in medicine. The idea that a useless sugar pill or harmless saline injection could result in a measurable improvement in a patient\u2019s symptoms, sometimes as good as taking an active drug, has been so hard to explain that some have even doubted whether it can be real.</p> <p>However, there is now evidence showing some people, known as \u201cplacebo responders\u201d, do feel or get better after unwittingly, or even wittingly, taking a placebo \u2013 and it\u2019s not just psychosomatic. Several studies are pointing to a biological basis for the placebo effect, with the latest research focused on a region of the brain known as the mid-frontal gyrus, which runs along the frontal lobes just above the eyes.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002570#sec003\">study</a>, carried out by Marwan Baliki and Vania Apkarian at Northwestern University in Chicago, involved a small number of chronic-pain patients with osteoarthritis of the knee. It is a rare example of a placebo study based on real patients rather than healthy volunteers who are just exposed to pain-inducing experiments to see how they feel when given a placebo.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We pinpointed a brain region, a hotspot or seat, that can predict the propensity of a patient\u2019s response to a placebo</p> <footer> <cite>Marwan Baliki, Northwestern University, Chicago</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Baliki used an MRI scanner to observe in real time how the brain of patients responded to a placebo \u2013 in this case a sugar pill instead of a painkiller. In short, he found that an area within the mid-frontal gyrus lit up or, in his own words, \u201cshowed a higher functional connectivity\u201d in patients who responded to the placebo, compared with non-responders.</p> <p>He concluded that this brain region seemed to be quite separate from another region of the brain known to be involved in responding to the effects of real painkilling drugs. In other words, Baliki appeared to have found the \u201cseat\u201d of the placebo effect within the brain.</p> <p>\u201cIn simple terms, we pinpointed a brain region, a hotspot or seat, that can predict the propensity of a patient\u2019s response to a placebo within the wider patient population suffering from chronic pain,\u201d Baliki says. \u201cWe also examined the specificity of our results by testing whether this hotspot can predict pain analgesia to an active drug. We found that it does not, suggesting that this brain region is specific for placebo analgesia.\u201d</p> <p>The findings suggest a biological basis for the placebo effect and raise the prospect of tests to see if individuals are going to be good placebo responders or not. For those who are responders, it could mean targeting them with placebo pain treatments that might work specifically for them. Or it could result in identifying placebo responders so that they don\u2019t get included in clinical trials, which have long been thought to be compromised by them.<br></p> <p>It is not, however, the first time that scientists have identified a brain region involved in the placebo effect. In 2007 for instance Jon-Kar Zubieta, now at the University of Utah, <a href=\"http://www.cell.com/neuron/abstract/S0896-6273%2807%2900462-X?_returnURL=http%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS089662730700462X%3Fshowall%3Dtrue&amp;cc=y=\">suggested that</a> the nucleus accumbens, which lies at the top of the brain stem, plays a role in moderating pain after injections of a placebo composed of harmless saline solution \u2013 at least in healthy volunteers.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/audio/2012/sep/17/science-weekly-podcast-quantum-biology\">Science Weekly podcast: Jim Al-Khalili on the wonders of quantum biology</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Other researchers, meanwhile, have focused on identifying the genetic basis of the placebo effect. This is based on the idea that certain signalling pathways in the brain, especially those involved in the \u201creward\u201d network, help to mediate the placebo effect. The idea is that these signalling pathways are under genetic control and that some people may be blessed with certain combinations of genes that make them more or less responsive to a placebo effect.</p> <p>Certainly, the more that scientists investigate the placebo, the weirder the effect seems to be. One <a href=\"http://www.cell.com/trends/molecular-medicine/abstract/S1471-4914%2815%2900043-X\">study</a> earlier this year found that taking a placebo for chronic lower back pain can work effectively for some people even when they are told that the treatment is just a \u201cpowerful placebo\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cOur data suggests that harnessing placebo effects without deception is possible in the context of a plausible rationale,\u201d explained Claudia Carvalho of the ISPA-Instituto Universitario in Lisbon. She found that this kind of \u201copen\u201d placebo reduced initial pain and disability by about 30%.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/07/110713182215.htm\">Another study</a> in 2011 on asthma patients found that placebo inhalers had no effect on increasing lung function. But asthma patients nevertheless reported that they felt significantly better after using a \u201cuseless\u201d inhaler \u2013 a baffling result to say the least.</p> <p>But if this is difficult to explain, then what about the \u201cnoncebo\u201d, the evil twin of the placebo, where a sugar pill actually makes people feel worse because they expect to suffer the side effects they have heard about? If the placebo effect has a genuine biological basis, with a seat in the brain and its own set of genes, then it\u2019s plausible the same is true for the noncebo. If that is found to be the case, things could get really interesting.</p>",
  "<p>The chairman of the Independent Press Standards Organisation was in full lamentation mode the other day. He didn\u2019t like \u201cthe tone and the really nasty edge\u201d to so much Brexit reporting.

Santi said he would worry about M5S\u2019s response to economic challenges if they came into power, particularly since they seem to oppose any public intervention when it comes to saving troubled banks, and that their anti-austerity policies would put Italy on a collision course with the European commission.</p> <p>\u201cI think the Five Star movement didn\u2019t come out of nowhere.

  "<p>Alicia Keys has taken over Times Square, bringing five blocks of one of the busiest areas of the western world to its knees. Her \u201csecret\u201d gig tonight is not so secret. She\u2019ll commandeer the epic digital billboards and her face \u2013 lightly freckled and without makeup, as is her way these days \u2013 will flash all over American Eagle Outfitters.</p> <p>Times Square is Keys\u2019s back yard. She was born in Hell\u2019s Kitchen in 1981 and grew up in a one-bedroom apartment on 43rd Street between 9th and 10th Avenue. Her teenage years coincided with the tenure of Mayor Rudy Giuliani: the street is now quietly gentrified, and features the Manhattan Plaza Health Club.</p> <p>She has booked the entire 57th floor of the W hotel to dress for the gig, rest, and do this interview in promotion of <a href=\"http://www.aliciakeys.com/alicia-announces-new-album-and-debuts-new-single/\"><em>Here</em></a>, her first album in four years. Her complicated management system functions like an onion. There is an outer layer of nervy young people glued to Samsungs, a middle layer of big characters in bomber jackets who emerge before show time and hand out laminates, and an inner layer \u2013 Key\u2019s confidants and partners in her company, AK Worldwide: longtime manager and co-writer Erika Rose (headscarf and curly haired child in sling), and DJ Walton \u2013 who is, among many things, a vocal coach and boxing coach with two full sleeves of tattoos.</p> <p>The machinery around the star exists as a shock absorber, and Alicia\u2019s suite is almost temple-like in its serenity. Four shadowy figures sit on high-backed chairs, like guests at a strange, gloomy dinner party. Two cameramen swoop around the room, filming the proceedings \u2013 everyone from Beyonc\u00e9 to Janelle Mon\u00e1e has their own personal film team these days, capturing your interview for their \u201cpersonal archive\u201d, or their legal department.</p> <p>In the corner is a girl in a headscarf and jeans who looks so unassuming I think it\u2019s another assistant. Alicia Keys moves to the sofa in her socks, pulls her knees up, and begins talking in her soft, low, boyish voice.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>New York wasn\u2019t like a\u00a0beauty pageant, it was a hard, grimy place, and you had to dress accordingly</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cTimes Square was dark \u2013 gee, it was dismal,\u201d she says. \u201cIn the 80s, when I was a little girl, this whole Midtown area was a different world. These are the streets that I walked, and learned my lessons on, and heard the music, and witnessed disenfranchised people, and people who just had dreams and hopes. Every pimp, every prostitute, every drug dealer, every Broadway dreamer wishing they could be a writer, or a musician, or an actor.\u201d</p> <p>Her white, Italian-Irish mother, Terria Augello (now Joseph), raised her alone, working as a legal assistant at the Chadbourne and Parke law firm at the Rockefeller Center from the year before she was born until 2001, when her daughter\u2019s debut album, <em>Songs in A Minor</em>, was released (it went on to sell 12m copies). Mum had attended NYU\u2019s School of the Arts and worked on and off as an actor. She started her daughter young: at four, Alicia got a part in <em>The Cosby Show</em>, as one of Rudy Huxtable\u2019s sleepover guests, and can be seen, small and giggling, riding Bill\u2019s leg like a bucking bronco.</p> <p>At 12, in 1993, she attended the newly created, publicly funded Professional Performing Arts School, 10 minutes walk from home and just off Broadway. Claire Danes and Britney Spears were pupils at one time. She was tutored by \u201cMiss Aziza\u2026\u201d she says wistfully. <a href=\"http://www.azizamiller.com/\">Aziza Miller</a> \u2013 \u201cOne of the most phenomenal women jazz instructors ever to be born. She was a pianist, an arranger, a producer, a composer, and she had so much vocal prowess. She was badass. And I know for a fact that she influenced a large part of what I became.\u201d</p> <p>The school kept her off the streets. \u201cYou walked out the door, you had to be ready to protect yourself,\u201d she says. \u201cBe covered up, just get to where you were going. I couldn\u2019t wear skirts, I couldn\u2019t wear heels. On the other hand, it was kind of the area where whoever didn\u2019t belong anywhere else could come, and belong.\u201d</p> <p>From mean streets to stage school to the big time, all by the age of 20, it was the American dream. When Keys released her first single, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Urdlvw0SSEc\">Fallin\u2019</a>, in 2001 she already had a certain kind of pedigree. She\u2019d been taken on by Clive Davis, who\u2019d signed Janis Joplin and mentored Whitney Houston. Her songs, filled with jazz chords and tinkling Moonlight Sonata-style intros, appealed to a mature audience as well as a young one; another big hit, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ju8Hr50Ckwk\">If I Ain\u2019t Got You</a>, sounds like a thumping Motown classic now.

Even her new album <em>Here</em> \u2013 full of ice-cool songs celebrating life\u2019s confusions and compromises \u2013 bears a closer relationship to neo-soul than the songwriting teams of Beyonc\u00e9 or Rihanna.</p> <p>She\u2019s already had one comeback \u2013 2010\u2019s <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/track/3xkxcbnc7G3XYuZt6eUnI5\"><em>Empire State of Mind</em></a>, with her friend Jay Z, is the biggest New York song since Sinatra\u2019s. And she has remained, quietly, part of the hip-hop elite: she\u2019s known Beyonc\u00e9 since they were 16, and was one of the first artists to sign to Tidal; she\u2019s struck up sponsorship deals with everyone from BlackBerry to American Express, and has a formidable philanthropy career. Then there\u2019s the politics: she performed between Bill and Hillary Clinton at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2016/jul/26/democratic-convention-day-two-clinton-nominee-sanders\">Philadelphia\u2019s Democratic National Convention in July</a>. Which was a difficult day all round, apparently.</p> <p>\u201cReally, it was pretty emotional,\u201d she says. \u201cBernie was coming up to support Hillary at that time, and there was this real disappointed energy \u2013 because Bernie is so beloved, and he has such powerful thoughts and ideas that really resonate with people. There was this energy to make sure that there wasn\u2019t a huge divide within the party, because that would have been devastating. I remember just wanting to relay that.\u201d</p> <p>She says she sees in Clinton the possibility for \u201chow powerful women can be\u201d, then adds, \u201cIt\u2019s emotional for me as a black woman, wanting to make sure that all the issues are addressed in America when it comes to race, when it comes to black people \u2013 wanting to make sure that message isn\u2019t lost. And that it is continuously on all our agendas \u2013 particularly Hillary\u2019s.\u201d</p> <p>Is she confident (we are talking four weeks ahead of the election) about the outcome?</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There\u2019s no end to what the family dynamic can look like, as long as it is filled with love</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cI just refuse to believe that anything else is going to happen,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I also know it\u2019s only going to happen if we\u2019re getting out and registering to vote. We have hope, we have potential; that I do believe in.\u201d</p> <p>In 2008, Keys <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/apr/15/aliciakeys.urban\">told <em>Blender</em> magazine</a> she thought the Black Panther movement would have gone global if they\u2019d had the platform musicians have today. She might have to start something herself, she mused at the time \u2013 then Black Lives Matter came along and she didn\u2019t have to. Tidal donated $1.5m this year, on what would have been Trayvon Martin\u2019s 21st birthday. In July, Keys\u2019s charitable foundation, <a href=\"http://weareheremovement.com/\">We Are Here,</a> put together a protest film \u2013<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_VaNhI4CLo\"> \u201c23 Ways You Could Be Killed If You Are Black in America\u201d</a> \u2013 which featured Rihanna and Pharrell Williams.

Artists reach people at their heart; it\u2019s the only time we meet in one place and put our differences aside. When you\u2019re in a forum listening to music, all you feel in that moment is love and the understanding.\u201d</p> <p>Keys has known her husband, the producer <a href=\"http://www.swizzworld.com/\">Swizz Beatz</a> (Kasseem Dean), since she was about 16, though they took years to get together. Kanye West once called Dean, 38, the best rap producer of all time. His more unusual accolades include global ambassador for New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation, and a place at Harvard Business School. Dean already had three children when he married Keys in 2010. His first son, Prince Nasir, with Nicole Levy, is 16. There\u2019s another, Kasseem, with Harlem songwriter Mashonda Tifrere, singer of the song <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/30612707\">No Panties</a>. And a girl, Nicole, by Jahna Sebastian, whose website claims she helped bring grime to Russia.</p> <p>Keys faced her share of scandal with the relationship, and covers it in the new single B<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWACsH1f2So\">lended Family (What You Do for Love)</a>, which includes a direct address to her stepchildren: \u201cI know it started with a little drama/ I hate you had to read it in the paper/ But everything\u2019s alright with me and your momma\u2026\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s about my personal journey with my family, and creating a family that\u2019s built on compassion and understanding,\u201d she says, in her broad, new age-y way. \u201cThat\u2019s not an easy road. A lot of the modern family is children from different relationships. That\u2019s what family is today, and there\u2019s never been a song about how beautiful it is. There\u2019s no end to what the family dynamic can look like, as long as it is filled with love for the kids. \u201d</p> <p>Her stepchildren, she says, call her Umi, which is Arabic for mother. Kasseem Dean is Muslim: \u201c4 years of greatness and cheers to 100 plus more inshallah\u201d he Instagrammed, on their anniversary. I ask her if she has converted to Islam. There is a pause, then she says:</p> <p>\u201cI love learning about different religions, and discovering the different ways to worship, and to love the greatness and the higher being that surrounds us all. I definitely believe in a bigger presence, and I really respect all religions; at their core they all teach the same message \u2013 community and kindness and looking out for each other.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HazJhPnrB8\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4HazJhPnrB8?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HazJhPnrB8\">Watch the video for Alicia Keys\u2019s In Common.</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Growing up, she rarely saw her own father, Craig Cook \u2013 an air steward of Jamaican background, who became a masseur \u2013 but she maintained a close relationship with his parents (though her father\u2019s absence was not, she points out, \u201cexactly a topic for the dinner table\u201d).</p> <p>\u201cI did have a deeper relationship with my nana than I did with my father, and again, that\u2019s how life goes.

And her makeup artist recently revealed that the no-makeup look <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/shortcuts/2016/oct/10/alicia-keys-no-makeup-look-not-quite-real\">actually requires quite a bit of makeup</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ce1f12c57424c740f2ecb41bd645da78ba974fc8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ce1f12c57424c740f2ecb41bd645da78ba974fc8/0_0_6208_6934/895.jpg\" alt=\"Alicia Keys\" width=\"895\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alicia Keys: \u2018Mary J Blige really resonated with me because she was from New York.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paola Kudacki</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But the campaign certainly suits Keys\u2019s muted, delicately retro R&amp;B persona. Like an American Neneh Cherry, what she was doing 15 years ago feels significant now. Compared with the modern-day vogue for ironic sluttiness, and the subsequent nail-biting over what it means to be feminist in pop, Keys and many of her contemporaries around the millennium offered something comparatively nuanced. Like TLC, her style was boyish \u2013 trousers, boots and braids \u2013 but her lyrics examined love and its vulnerability. One of her signature songs, You Don\u2019t Know My Name, feels almost quaint now, as she poses as a waitress and rings the guy in the \u201cfly blue suit\u201d to ask him out: \u201cI know girls don\u2019t usually do this\u2026\u201d</p> <p>It was a relaxed kind of self-possession, girl power without a soapbox. When I ask her what was going on, she lights up.</p> <p>\u201cIt was good, it was so good,\u201d she says. \u201cIn the 1990s, with Mariah Carey, Whitney Houston, those really big female artists were very glamorous, it was all about the glamour at that time. And so there was a big switch, the desire to be more who you were, not so beholden to this whole standard of beauty. It was a liberation. You see Mary J Blige \u2013 she did the same, wearing the combat boots.\u201d</p> <p>So it was an attitude, as much as a fashion?</p> <p>\u201cYeah, definitely. Mary really resonated with me because she was from New York, and that\u2019s what New York looked like: it wasn\u2019t like a beauty pageant, it was a hard, grimy place, and you had to dress accordingly. That represented the type of girl that I was, so that worked for me.\u201d</p> <p>Does she think there\u2019s been a change, in the way female R&amp;B looks now?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/sep/21/alicia-keys-review-roundhouse-london\">Alicia Keys review \u2013 soul singer opens door to blistering basement bash</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cYes. To me, it just seems like there\u2019s a lot less variety,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen you talk about the TLCs, or the Marys, you had a chance to see women in different orbits. [TLC\u2019s] Chilli was one way, T-Boz had a whole other style. Now, I think we see almost only one thing when it comes to female performers. Obviously they\u2019re beautiful, so you want to emulate that. But I think there\u2019s some confusion as to what beauty looks like \u2013 it can only be oversexualised. What\u2019s refreshing is when you see people who know how to express themselves in a multitude of ways.</p> <p>\u201cWe think \u2013 or maybe we\u2019re shown \u2013 that the only way to express ourselves is through that very sexy energy. I think there\u2019s more than that which shows our power. For me, I sometimes feel the most sexy when I\u2019m totally covered head to toe.\u201d</p> <p>We meet in the week that it was revealed that Donald Trump <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/donald-trump-howard-stern-tapes-women-35_uk_57fa46e1e4b01fa2b904368b\">acknowledged that his daughter is a piece of ass \u2013 and that 35 is the age he tends to check out on a woman</a>.</p> <p>She cracks her knuckles unnervingly loudly. \u201cI don\u2019t listen to anything that he says.

  "<p>Picture a world where no one ever posts anything on social media about nights out or evenings slobbing in front of the TV; instead they share details about work meetings, or recommendations for accounting apps. Why? Because exhibiting exactly this sort of \u201cconscientious\u201d behaviour on social media could potentially shave hundreds of pounds off your insurance premiums, it emerged this week.</p> <p>Motor insurer Admiral announced it was going to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/nov/02/admiral-to-price-car-insurance-based-on-facebook-posts\" title=\"\">use social media to analyse the personalities of first-time drivers</a>. If their Facebook posts indicated they had personality traits Admiral could link to safer driving habits and fewer claims, annual discounts of up to \u00a3350 would be offered via the insurer\u2019s new firstcarquote product.</p> <p>But just before launch the insurer was forced into a U-turn. Facebook said the product would break its terms and conditions, which prohibits the use of data obtained from its service to make decisions about eligibility. \u201cFollowing discussions with Facebook, the product is launching with reduced functionality,\u201d an Admiral spokesperson announced. It will still, however, ask for access to drivers\u2019 public Facebook profiles before it provides them with a quotation, so customers can \u201cshare some information to secure a faster, simpler and discounted quote\u201d.</p> <p>This is the new world of big data and insurance, where social media websites are vast sources of valuable information just waiting to be plundered. \u201cInsurers have been recruiting data scientists, and I think it is very likely they are already using information from social media websites to set premiums,\u201d says Gary Frost, managing director of 51zero, a software consultancy specialising in data gathering and analysis for financial services firms. \u201cIf they\u2019re not, they\u2019re missing a trick. It provides extra detail and information which can help improve their risk scoring.\u201d</p> <p>Insurers can access all the data that is posted publicly on Twitter and Facebook, Frost says. \u201cYou can\u2019t buy access to a private social media profile, but insurers can potentially find out all the public information these sites store about you, such as who you are friends with, your public updates, public pages you have liked and posts you have publicly recommended or shared.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I think it is very likely insurers are already using information from social media to set premiums</p> <footer> <cite>Gary Frost, data analyst</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cSo if you buy a cherry-bomb sport exhaust to soup up your Vauxhall Corsa and talk about it on social media, classification and clustering technology is likely to place your profile with a community of higher-risk consumers.\u201d</p> <p>Any lifestyle information the insurer can glean about you from any source \u2013 for example, your sexual orientation, race, religion, predilections, estimated consumption of alcohol, cigarettes and even saturated fat when out socialising \u2013 could potentially be used to reassess your application and increase or decrease the cost of your premiums.</p> <h2><strong>Mining other information</strong></h2> <p>It\u2019s not just your social media data that insurers are using, however. \u201cInsurers are always looking for new ways of creating an advantage for themselves, so they can win more customers and be more efficient,\u201d says Simon McCulloch, director of insurance for Comparethemarket. \u201cThey will use all the information they can gather about you to offer more accurate pricing and personalise your quotes.\u201d</p> <p>Even seemingly innocuous information can potentially be linked to a higher or lower claims ratio, and therefore affect your premium. This includes the web browser you use to buy your policy, the time of day and month of the year you do so, and whether you use a comparison site.</p> <p>Each time you apply for insurance, regardless of how you pay for your policy, your insurer is likely to soft-search your credit record. \u201cThere are very significant correlations between likely claims and credit scores,\u201d says Kevin Roberts, director at Legal &amp; General. \u201cBetter credit scores generally result in fewer claims \u2013 we don\u2019t know why.\u201d</p> <p>Consumers shouldn\u2019t assume they can control the data they share. Insurers will look for any previous contact and use that to make a judgment about a new application. For example, if you visit two comparison websites in quick succession to request quotes, all the insurers which offered you quotes the first time will be able to match your profile when you visit the second site \u2013 and because they know they\u2019ve quoted for you previously, they may take a dim view of any changes to what you disclose, such as your annual mileage. \u201cI\u2019d expect that to have a negative impact on your premium. It may be seen as indicative of dishonest behaviour,\u201d says McCulloch.</p> <p>Similarly, if you already hold a policy with an insurer, the answers you gave when you first applied may be analysed in relation to the new application. For example, any disclosures about high value ticket items or burglaries on your home policy may be considered in relation to a motor policy.</p> <p>Insurers have also found a correlation between callouts on motor breakdown and home emergency policies and claims on motor and home insurance products, says Roberts. So if you are loyal to a breakdown service and make few callouts, you may be offered a cheaper insurance policy by any provider with access to that data. \u201cAA members tend to be a better risk for us,\u201d says Ian Crowder, spokesperson for the AA\u2019s insurance arm. \u201cWe know them so can offer discounts. They tend on the whole to care for their vehicles and thus are more likely to recognise risks when it comes to motoring.\u201d</p> <p>The AA is running a 10,000-driver trial of \u201cconnected cars\u201d (vehicles connected to the internet) to, it says, identify faults before a breakdown. This will involve installing a dongle, which will allow it to track drivers\u2019 behaviour, including speeding, cornering, acceleration, braking and high-rev incidents, and to map what happens where. \u201cThis could inform insurers of potential risk, not just about behaviours but the type of roads that are driven on and when,\u201d Crowder says.</p> <p>When you apply for insurance, firms will already attempt to analyse your whereabouts and the places you travel to. \u201cCompanies can obtain lots of information about postcodes from third-party sources,\u201d says Toni Vitale, director at law firm Addleshaw Goddard. For example, he says, if you provide your car insurer with details of your home and work postcodes, it may map out the most likely route between the two, and then take into account the crime rates of the postcodes you will be passing through each day.</p> <p>Like the AA, supermarkets also factor in the information they\u2019ve gathered about you when deciding your premiums. When you apply for a car, home or pet insurance quote from Tesco Bank, it looks for a Clubcard number linked to your household. Its privacy policy tells customers that \u201cTesco Stores Limited make this Clubcard information (including information about purchases \u2026) available to us to enable us to generate a risk score for your household, which is used to calculate the level of Clubcard discount Tesco Bank and its insurers may offer you.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>AA motorists tend to care for their vehicles and thus are more likely to recognise risks when it comes to motoring</p> <footer> <cite>Ian Crowder, AA Insurance</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Tesco Bank says the most important factors it considers are not your individual transactions, but the length of time you have been shopping at Tesco and the amounts you spend. Some Clubcard holders will pay 25% less than other people, although Tesco says most are typically offered discounts of 10%-15%. \u201cWe only use Clubcard data to reduce the cost of our policies for customers,\u201d a spokesperson says.</p> <p>Similarly, if you\u2019re a Nectar card holder Sainsbury\u2019s says it will look at the size of your spend and how frequently you shop at its stores, and offer you up to 15% off its home and car insurance premiums. \u201cInformation about your individual purchases is available, but we don\u2019t use it to make any decisions,\u201d a spokesperson says.</p> <h2><strong>Data discrimination</strong></h2> <p>Jim Killock of the Open Rights Group is sceptical about the rewards on offer in return for this data. \u201cI think insurers are tempting people to share their data by saying they might get a discount, but in fact they\u2019ve just priced everybody else up,\u201d he says. \u201cAn insurer\u2019s goal is to maximise its profits, after all, and now they are using unrelated information to make judgments about people. We are not aware precisely how far these judgments might go. For example, a machine might decide there\u2019s a correlation between someone\u2019s ethnic background and the claims data, and start pricing people out of insurance. In this way, using unrelated data may introduce racial biases and discriminate against people without good reason.\u201d</p> <p>In September, the Financial Conduct Authority identified that the use of big data had the potential to leave some consumers worse off, and said it was concerned that it could enhance an insurer\u2019s ability to identify ways to charge certain customers more.</p> <p>\u201cThe increasing amounts of data from a wider range of sources, alongside sophisticated analytical tools, might lead to the use of reasons other than risk and cost in pricing becoming more prevalent,\u201d said Christopher Woolard, the FCA\u2019s director of strategy and competition.</p> <p>\u201cTo assess how different pricing factors are used, we will \u2026 look at pricing practices in a limited number of firms in the retail general insurance sector this year.\u201d</p> <h2>MANAGE YOUR PROFILES</h2> <p>\u25a0 \u201cCheck a site\u2019s terms and conditions,\u201d says Toni Vitale from Addleshaw Goddard. \u201cKnow what you are signing up to and how they are going to share your information with other companies.\u201d</p> <p>\u25a0 \u201cDon\u2019t fill your Facebook page with fast cars or show that you\u2019re an adrenalin junkie.

  "<p>In a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/nov/03/article-50-high-court-ruling-high-court-set-to-rule-on-whether-mps-should-vote-on-triggering-article-50-politics-live\" title=\"\">landmark legal decision last Thursday</a>, the high court upheld a legal challenge brought against the government by Gina Miller and others, and ruled the government cannot use the royal prerogative to trigger article 50 of the Lisbon treaty, and so formally commence the process to leave the EU, without parliamentary approval.</p> <p>The court\u2019s judgment means that the process must be subject to parliamentary control and oversight. Importantly (especially in the light of some recent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/nov/04/enemies-of-the-people-british-newspapers-react-judges-brexit-ruling\" title=\"\">media comments</a>), the court stressed that this is purely a question of law and that the court is not concerned with, and does not express any view about, the merits of leaving the EU. That is a political consideration.</p> <p>In brief, the case arose because article 50 allows the UK to withdraw from the EU \u201cin accordance with its own constitutional requirements\u201d \u2013 but there was disagreement as to what the UK constitution actually requires.</p> <p>The government argued that it could use royal prerogative powers (namely, that residue of monarchical authority now exercised by ministers) to authorise the UK\u2019s withdrawal. While it is clear that prerogative powers cover international relations and the conclusion of treaties, it is settled UK constitutional law that an act of parliament \u2013 in this case the European Communities Act (ECA) 1972 \u2013 cannot be supplanted by the exercise of a prerogative power.</p> <p>The court accepted the claimants\u2019 arguments that, once notice is given under article 50, some rights under EU law (as incorporated into domestic law by the ECA) would inevitably be lost on completion of the article 50 process. Therefore, the government cannot give notice under article 50 without reference to parliament. This judgment can be seen as a victory for parliament. During the EU referendum, voters were constantly urged to \u201ctake back control\u201d and regain parliamentary sovereignty from the EU.</p> <p>Yet in what sense is parliament taking back control, if the government is able, using its ancient prerogative powers, to manage the whole EU withdrawal process without any significant parliamentary involvement? That would be extremely undemocratic \u2013 and democracy is what we are told the EU referendum was about.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Every UK national has been endowed with rights under EU law. Some of these will vanish on triggering article 50</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Furthermore, the court\u2019s judgment makes clear that the exclusion of parliament in the process is not only undemocratic, it is illegal. There is a wealth of case law supporting the claimants\u2019 case, some of it dating back to the 17th century and the English civil wars. Those wars, and the ejection of two kings during that century, established that parliament is sovereign and that the executive cannot ignore it, where it has no legal authority to do so.</p> <p>This judgment makes clear that the government does not have any such legal authority in the context of triggering article 50. However, it must be stressed that the judgment also makes clear the importance of rights in the Brexit process. Much of the judgment concerns legal arguments over the ECA, which can seem arcane. Yet they are of vital importance to every citizen.</p> <p>The EU has been described as a \u201cnew legal order\u201d and it is in many important aspects different from ordinary international law. One such aspect has been the extent to which it confers rights on individuals. Through the ECA, every UK national has been endowed with rights under EU law \u2013 rights of free movement and residence in other EU countries, but also many other types of rights, such as employment rights, consumer rights, or rights to information. Some of these will vanish as a result of triggering article 50 and the withdrawal process.</p> <p>The government has said it will transfer some EU law into UK law through a \u201cgreat repeal bill\u201d, and then decide in future whether or not to retain it. Thursday\u2019s judgment makes clear that decisions that inevitably remove rights may not be taken by the executive alone. Parliament must be consulted.</p> <p>What are the practical consequences of this judgment? First, a government spokesperson has said the government will appeal, in which case it will be fast-tracked and heard very quickly by the UK supreme court. The government might try to change its position, and argue that a notification under article&#xa0;50 could be revoked \u2013 this would be the opposite of its high court concession that triggering article 50 would inevitably result in the withdrawal of the UK from the EU (and so lead to loss of individual rights). At present both government and claimants are treating the triggering of article 50 as the inevitable point when it becomes clear that the ECA will be repealed.</p> <p>But if it were acknowledged that such a move is reversible, the point would be that, in triggering article 50 by&#xa0;executive act, the government would not be subverting statute at that point, it would not be rendering the ECA a dead letter, inevitably leading to a loss of rights.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2016/nov/05/barristers-urge-liz-truss-to-condemn-attacks-on-brexit-ruling-judges\">Liz Truss defends judiciary after Brexit ruling criticism</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Some believe a notification under article&#xa0;50 is revocable. But this would involve a question of EU law, and the final answer could only be given by the&#xa0;European court of justice. Moreover, such a reversal of the government\u2019s arguments would be politically risky, as it would amount to acknowledging that the UK might decide not to leave the EU, and that Brexit does not mean Brexit after all, perhaps not a very likely position for the government to take.</p> <p>Thursday\u2019s ruling is a strong judgment, by a powerful trio of judges including the lord chief justice, and its reasoning looks hard to overturn. If the ruling stands, it will be necessary for a bill to be introduced in parliament. Although it is highly unlikely parliament will vote against triggering article&#xa0;50, parliament may well seek to impose certain conditions on the government.</p> <p>The June referendum resulted in a vote for the UK to leave the EU. However, it did not determine the way in which the UK leaves the EU. The court\u2019s judgment means that the elected parliament will have a role in debating and deciding many matters, rather than their being determined in private by the executive.</p> <p>Finally, the judgment raises a question of the role of the devolved nations. If Westminster is to be involved, what about the devolved parliaments? By constitutional convention, devolved parliaments are asked for their consent when Westminster either legislates with regard to devolved matters (see section 28(8) of the Scotland Act) or where it legislates to increase or reduce their powers. If a bill is introduced allowing article&#xa0;50 to be triggered, would this require legislative consent motions, and, if so, would the devolved nations give their consent? Conflicting answers have been given on this point, and the issue is highly politically charged.</p> <p>One thing is clear \u2013 Brexit is constitutionally fascinating, as well as constitutionally problematic. It also raises as many difficult questions for our understanding of the British constitution as it does of the UK\u2019s relationship with the European Union.</p> <p><em>Professor Sionaidh Douglas-Scott is anniversary chair in law and co-director at the Centre for Law and Society in a Global Context, Queen Mary School of Law, University of London</em></p>",

It got me marked down \u2013 but it was a wake-up call to follow what I was really interested in.\u201d</p> <p>When a vacant shop premises came up, Catalano and his brother Franco borrowed \u00a35,000 from their mother and set up a vintage design shop called <a href=\"http://www.15collingwood.com/\">15 Collingwood</a>.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I get first dibs on everything we buy for the shop, which is fatal</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>As is the case with many furniture dealers, there is a fair bit of to-ing and fro-ing of items between home and work. \u201cI get first dibs on everything we buy for the shop, which is fatal,\u201d says Catalano.

Outside, early autumn winds tease the sea into peaks the colour of tarnished silver and the road along the front is slicked from the showers just passed. Inside, all is spades over hearts, winning tricks and the ballad of minor suits. They come here every year, these bridge players, and fill their days with rubber after rubber. The hotel smells of furniture polish and this morning\u2019s breakfast buffet and, most of all, certainty. It is not just the building which is solid and redoubtable.

Or is it to be pockmarked by dinners accessorised by white oval side dishes of over-boiled cauliflower that no one ever eats? I am trying to travel hopefully, but I have travelled so far and wide and hope is fragile in the face of bitter experience.</p> <p>As my mother always used to do in such circumstances, I reach for the <a href=\"http://www.thegoodfoodguide.co.uk/\"><em>Good Food Guide</em></a>. It\u2019s barely worth pointing out how crowded the restaurant guide market has become, both online and off. I am tolerant of a few. I am suspicious of some and utterly dismissive of others.

Where others have a modicum of good taste you have a \u201crevenue generation model\u201d, and desperation.</p> <p>But the <em>Good Food Guide</em>? The fat, dog-eared copy that sat on the windowsill of my mother\u2019s office, its spine broken, was a greedy person\u2019s journal of hope. It may have changed ownership a few times since it was first launched in 1951 by Raymond Postgate in a mission to bring pleasure to a postwar Britain that had mislaid the habit, but it still does the thing.

On the downside my fears were confirmed by the fact that there was just one entry for the entire town.

At the heart of its kitchen is a series of freshly roasted spice mixes, which lift the food a long way from the overly familiar batch cooking that rules too many so-called Indians in Britain (in reality, mostly Bengali).</p> <p>The setting is thoroughly domestic: a white stucco villa on a residential street set back from the seafront which, inside, has been given a gentle makeover. These rooms have chairs and shiny tables, like a proper restaurant, but could quite easily become someone\u2019s living room all over again. A group of us rampage through the menu. From the specials there are lamb chops, marinated in their own lime pickle, which is all fire and acidity. The heat of the oven has mellowed the punch a little but turned it into something deeper and more savoury. The chops are pink at the middle, the fat crisp and running. I make a note to start marinating all my meat in lime pickle.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>From the specials there are lamb chops, marinated in their own lime pickle, which is all brilliant fire and acidity</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>There is baby squid in a light sauce full of cracked black pepper, and jeera chicken, pieces of breast cooked off in a rough-hewn roasted spice mix \u2013 half way between a grind and a sauce \u2013 which turns the meat into a vehicle for aromatics. Pili pili boga brings pieces of aubergine, cauliflower, bell peppers and mushrooms tossed in a masala and cornflour and deep fried, to produce a kind of Indian tempura.

I can\u2019t quite claim that Jaya manages that. There were indeed a bunch of dun-coloured stews, both of lamb and chicken, and they did have their similarities. But all of them boasted an uncommon depth; of sauces built up (as against reduced down in the French style) starting with freshly roasted spices and then layering punch and heat and power. Two stood out. One was a brilliant fish masala, which was sweet and earthy and full of hunks of salmon which, remarkably, still had enough in the tank to taste of themselves. The other was a non-meat curry of boiled eggs and potatoes which, curiously, was the meatiest of the lot \u2013 it took the soothing eggs to calm everything down.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"33b38d076ffa46e4c41106801070c022b11216ab\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/33b38d076ffa46e4c41106801070c022b11216ab/1590_706_2792_2526/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Curiously, the meatiest of the lot\u2019: the non-meat alu anday curry.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"905\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Curiously, the meatiest of the lot\u2019: the non-meat alu anday curry.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Colin McPherson</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>We mopped at the sauces with freshly baked naans, their edges blistered from the heat, the insides soft and steaming.

The judgment had been \u201ca wakeup call\u201d to those who had been \u201cwalking around with smiles on their faces\u201d since the referendum, he said. It had become clear during the Conservative party conference that the government was intent on a \u201chard Brexit\u201d, involving the removal of the UK from the customs union and the single market, and that it believed the referendum gave it a mandate, if not a democratic duty, to deliver.</p> <p>There had been a period of sniping from the Remainers, but it had been judged of little consequence, Flynn suggested. But now the phoney war was over. Or, as one senior Brexiter, a former government minister not at the event, told the <em>Observer</em>: \u201cThe Remainers have won this first battle. Now we have to win the war\u201d.</p> <p>It was shortly after 10am on Thursday that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/nov/03/article-50-high-court-ruling-high-court-set-to-rule-on-whether-mps-should-vote-on-triggering-article-50-politics-live\">high court\u2019s ruling was delivered</a>. Its impact proved to be all the greater due to the assumption that the challenge was a lost cause, a last futile attempt to turn the Brexit tide. There had also been an unusual level of secrecy around the verdict. None of the lawyers involved had been given the normal advance drafts of the judgment to check for mistakes and to prepare their submissions.</p> <p>The government had argued during a three-day hearing that nothing in the <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1972/68/introduction\">European Communities Act of 1972</a> restricted the crown\u2019s power to withdraw from EU treaties using the royal prerogative without recourse to parliament.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d984fc6b149c6d2c2df4291ee86fb6e151de31b4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d984fc6b149c6d2c2df4291ee86fb6e151de31b4/0_0_660_1042/633.jpg\" alt=\"The Daily Telegraph with headline 'The judges versus the people'\" width=\"633\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Daily Telegraph makes its feelings known on the matter of the high court ruling.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But the lord chief justice was having none of it.

A No 10 spokesman said May had explained to European commission president Jean-Claude Juncker and German chancellor Angela Merkel that \u201cwhile the government is disappointed by the judgment, we remain of the firm belief that we have strong legal arguments ahead of the case which will be moving to the supreme court next month\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe prime minister also confirmed that the planned timetable for notification of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/nov/03/ruling-on-brexit-opens-way-to-mps-revolt\">article 50</a> remains the same,\u201d the spokesman added. Whether that proves to be the case \u2013 May has promised to trigger article 50 by the end of March \u2013 is very much open to question.</p> <p>The Brexit secretary, David Davis, has confirmed that a parliamentary bill will most likely be necessary if the high court\u2019s ruling is upheld, and such a bill could be amended with stipulations over everything from a second referendum on the terms of the final deal to mere reassurances on general goals. The proposed legislation may bounce between the Commons and the Lords over weeks and months. \u201cWe will make sure that we build into that bill a referendum that will take place before the UK leaves the EU to give us the opportunity to endorse or reject that deal,\u201d Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6d3248d4a96ec690cebe272b9d2daff67cf5deb7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6d3248d4a96ec690cebe272b9d2daff67cf5deb7/0_65_4000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Theresa May, the prime minister\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Theresa May, the prime minister, has told European commission president Jean-Claude Juncker and German chancellor Angela Merkel that she believes the government has strong legal arguments to take to the supreme court next month.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Daniel Leal-Olivas/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>In a sign of the import</strong> of the moment, for the first time since the court was established in 2009, all 11 justices of the supreme court will now sit to hear the government\u2019s appeal over four days in early December.</p> <p>On which way the judges will fall, every politician has a view. Ken Clarke, the former chancellor and justice secretary, said he felt that the verdict was \u201cin line with modern constitutional law\u201d. \u201cNobody starts a war nowadays without getting parliamentary approval, and nobody should completely break economic and trade links with our closest allies without parliamentary approval\u201d, he told the <em>Observer</em>. \u201cThe referendum was always supposed to be advisory.\u201d</p> <p>The former cabinet minister, John Redwood, one of John Major\u2019s famous Maastricht \u201cbastards\u201d, who made the then prime minister\u2019s attempts to sign that EU treaty such a torture, insisted that the decision would be swiftly seen as a piece of \u201cshoddy work\u201d and rejected. \u201cI assume the government is right and they will reverse the lower court\u2019s decision, because it is such a bad decision,\u201d he said. \u201cThe passage on the referendum is just laughable. They just assert that it is advisory when every household was sent a letter making it very clear that we [the people] are making the decision and parliament will implement it for you. It was in the Hansard record and the prime minister repeated it. The supreme court has every reason to say \u2018You haven\u2019t understood referenda\u2019.\u201d</p> <p><strong>On Monday the government</strong> will make a statement in parliament on the matter, and a cross-party meeting of MPs who had campaigned for Remain concluded that they would wait until the new ruling to take any decisions on the way forward. But already even those who say they will not block article 50 out of respect to their constituents are citing an array of reassurances that they will require in any upcoming bill. Parliament has been jolted back to life. \u201cCentral government is dominated by the London perspective and the London economy,\u201d said Andy Burnham, the MP for Leigh who is standing to be the mayor of Manchester. \u201cWe can\u2019t have trade deals that protect the City of London but sacrifice other sectors.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4176f00b2eb62e77540e25da5bccf14b3bb9ec9d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4176f00b2eb62e77540e25da5bccf14b3bb9ec9d/0_199_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Former shadow home secretary Andy Burnham\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018We can\u2019t have trade deals that protect the City of London but sacrifice other sectors,\u2019 says former shadow home secretary Andy Burnham.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nick Ansell/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Clarke added: \u201cI will vote against article 50.

The key thing is where we move on from that. To start holding the government to account.</p> <p>\u201cThe referendum decided we would leave but no two ministers are agreed on what steps are and what alternative we are putting in place. Once the government has agreed on a policy on our economic and trading relations with the wider world, it seems to be plain that it is accountable to parliament for that policy.\u201d</p> <p>The Conservative MP Stephen Phillips, who campaigned to leave the EU, quit his seat on Friday in protest at the government\u2019s attempt to sideline parliament\u2019s role in shaping Brexit.</p> <p><strong>But as parliament stirs</strong>, so have many of the people who voted for leaving the EU but who came to believe last week, with encouragement from some in the media and political classes, that something undemocratic is afoot. It is even believed by some that those who are celebrating last week\u2019s victory may come to reap a whirlwind, especially if the prime minister feels that she needs a general election to change the nature of parliament in favour of her goals. \u201cThe Lib Dems think defying the referendum result is an electoral ticket back to the big time,\u201d said former justice minister Dominic Raab. \u201cTheir antics just look like irresponsible opportunism, precisely when the country needs to see some unity of purpose behind the government\u2019s Brexit negotiations.\u201d</p> <p>In the country at large, the mood has become newly toxic. Waiting for his wife outside Gloucester\u2019s historic New Inn on Friday, Ray Marchmont said he was fed up with politicians, politics, the judiciary and probably the media. Gloucester voted Leave by 58.5% to Remain\u2019s 41.5% in June, and Marchmont supported the winning side. \u201cMy vote\u2019s gone out of the window,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ve taken it away from us. I didn\u2019t know anything about this court case. It was a shock when I heard about it, I couldn\u2019t get my head around it. They\u2019ve just said, stuff it, we\u2019re going to do what we want.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"67fbbd655c624f336dd047f7b31535de1ee27084\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/67fbbd655c624f336dd047f7b31535de1ee27084/806_0_2419_3024/800.jpg\" alt=\"MP Stephen Phillips\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Former Conservative MP Stephen Phillips quit his seat in protest at the government\u2019s attempt to sideline parliament\u2019s role in shaping Brexit.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stephen Phillips</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The 66-year-old Ukip supporter, added: \u201cI think a lot of it is sour grapes. They\u2019ve said \u2018you have your vote, now we\u2019re going to decide\u2019. If they do vote to turn it over, then I think there could be repercussions.\u201d</p> <p>Jacqui Robins, who like Marchmont lives in the city and was one of the 37,776 people to vote Leave in Gloucester, also expressed bewilderment. \u201cIf it\u2019s the people\u2019s choice, then the politicians shouldn\u2019t go against it,\u201d she said. \u201cWhy ask the people if that\u2019s what they\u2019re going to do? It seems like a waste of money and time.\u201d</p> <p>Robins had been intending to vote Remain but had changed her mind during the campaign. \u201cI was going to vote to stay, but then I thought change is good. But if we\u2019re going to go out, then out means out,\u201d she declared, echoing the prime minister\u2019s Brexit utterance.</p> <p>Back in Green Park, O\u2019Flynn, who since leaving Farage\u2019s side has become a Ukip MEP for the East of England, said there was no need for the newspapers to apologise for their attacks on the judiciary \u2013 in fact, he wants more of it. \u201cJudges have this particular conceit of themselves that they\u2019re so lofty that they\u2019re immune to the vulgarity of public opinion. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s true\u201d, he said, \u201cand that\u2019s why I was delighted by the newspaper coverage. We need to harness the public outrage. What can Ukip do? I\u2019ve come to the rather happy conclusion that it is our solemn duty to be shamelessly populist.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>From the day that she stepped into Number 10, it has been a no-brainer to some of her colleagues that Theresa May ought to call an early general election. As it has also been to many MPs on the other side of the Commons. Her majority in parliament is slender and just became slimmer with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/nov/04/stephen-phillips-resigns-over-undemocratic-brexit-process\" title=\"\">resignation of the Tory MP Stephen Phillips</a>, a disillusioned Outer. The Conservatives are favourites to retake his seat, but they won\u2019t be so fortunate with other byelections. John Major started with a larger majority in the parliament that began in 1992 and had lost it by the time he was done. Another reason for her to go to the country early is that the Tory majority doesn\u2019t really belong to Mrs May. It was won by Whatshisname, that bloke who used to live at Number 10. She lacks the personal mandate that flows to a prime minister who has won an election in her own right.</p> <p>The way she has behaved towards senior members of the old regime has created a big club of enemies on her backbenches. Asked recently what he was up to, one very senior figure in the Cameron cabinet smiled: \u201cBiding my time.\u201d Then there is Brexit. At some point in this parliament, probably at several points, there will be torrid political and constitutional crises over Britain\u2019s departure from the European Union. There will be resignations by ministers. There will be deadlocks and breakdowns in the negotiations. It is highly likely that there will be serious economic convulsions as well. Better, so goes an argument popular with Tory MPs, for Mrs May to armour herself with the much larger majority that the opinion polls indicate can be hers for the asking. That would give her five clear years to get through Brexit and all its havocs.</p> <p>Mrs May has heard those arguments \u2013 and used to dismiss them. She said the voters weren\u2019t clamouring for an election. She thought that what the country most wanted was stability. It didn\u2019t fit with her image of herself to do something that would look opportunistic. Nor did it suit her risk-averse temperament. Her team calculated that Labour was in such a dreadful state that the Tories didn\u2019t need to rush for a quick kill.</p> <p>Has that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/nov/03/ruling-on-brexit-opens-way-to-mps-revolt\" title=\"\">calculus been changed</a> by the high court ruling that the government must secure parliamentary approval before it can formally trigger divorce proceedings with the European Union? It has. The court ruling was not, as the more hysterical Brextremists have been frothing, an example of elitist judges frustrating the will of the people. The court was reasserting the fundamental principle that the executive cannot rule by monarchical decree, but must seek the consent of parliament if it wants to change the law. There is an alternative to the rule of law \u2013 it is called dictatorship. Those who campaigned to leave the EU in the name of restoring parliamentary sovereignty ought to be able to grasp this.</p> <p>The government might overturn the ruling with a successful appeal to the supreme court, but that looks unlikely. If the supremes agree that the government has to ask parliament before it can activate Article 50, it is as yet unclear how Mrs May intends to conform to the instruction. Some in government seem to think that they might get away with tabling a crude take-it-or-leave-it motion demanding that parliament simply rubber-stamps her decision. That would be defiant of the spirit of the court ruling and perhaps also of its letter. Which is why some ministers think they will have to bring forward legislation.</p> <p>Parliament would not take that as an opportunity to block Brexit. Most MPs were Remainers and so were the majority of peers, but they are not going to flatly defy the referendum result. Parliament might have something to say about the timing of the departure. March is a lousy choice of month to start the countdown to withdrawal. There is a presidential election in France next spring and German elections are due in the early autumn. Nothing meaningful will be negotiated until these are over, which means Mrs May\u2019s current plan simply diminishes the time available to try to make a success of it. MPs and peers could be doing both her and Britain a favour if they slowed her down by a few months.</p> <p>What parliament will definitely do is demand to know more about the government\u2019s exit strategy, if I am not being naive in imagining that such a thing exists. For more than a hundred days, Mrs May has sheltered behind the meaningless mantra \u201cBrexit means Brexit\u201d. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/17/theresa-may-brexit-early-general-election\" title=\"\">As one of the first to mock</a> the vacuity of that tautology, I have to confess that it has proved a more durable blocking mechanism than I anticipated, a testimony to the potency of stubborn repetition. One explanation for this long silence could be that the government has an exit plan of such elegance that it is being kept concealed to build up the suspense and increase our collective awe when it is revealed in all its brilliance. No, me neither.</p> <p>I was at the <em>Spectator</em> parliamentary awards dinner when Boris Johnson had the audience in involuntary spasms by declaring that the government would make <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/nov/03/brexit-will-be-titanic-success-says-boris-johnson\" title=\"\">a \u201ctitanic success\u201d of Brexit.</a> There are some deckchairs over there that need rearranging, foreign secretary. The prime minister responded with a threat that was no less vicious for coming in the guise of a joke. Mr Johnson had unwisely compared himself with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/nov/01/michael-heseltine-confesses-strangling-mothers-dog-to-death-kim-alsatian\" title=\"\">alsatian throttled by Michael Heseltine.</a> Mrs May said: <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-37863003\" title=\"\">\u201cBoris, the dog was put down when its master decided it wasn\u2019t needed any more.\u201d</a> Yes. She really did. In a room crowded with senior politicians and journalists, the prime minister told her foreign secretary that she would kill him when it pleased her.</p> <p>The government is concealing its intentions not to keep the EU guessing but to try to hide its internal confusions and divisions.</p> <p>When the negotiations begin, and that will be in less than six months\u2019 time if Mrs May preserves her timetable, a lot of it will become very public anyway. She will have to tell all the key actors in the EU, including the commission and the heads of government, what sort of deal she is looking for. It will not stay secret for five minutes. The big trade-off at the heart of the negotiation will be between immigration and trade. That is already known, as are the various permutations of a deal. One of the arguments for not calling an election was that it would force an early reveal of precisely what Mrs May wants from the negotiation and that would inflame Tory divisions. If the consequence of the court ruling is that she has to show more of her hand anyway, that reason for avoiding an early election falls away. The Fixed Term Parliament Act is often cited as an obstacle. Written into the statute book during the coalition years to stop the Tories doing the dirty on the Lib Dems or vice-versa, the legislation does make it more laborious to trigger an election. In the old days, the prime minister could just pop down to Buck House to ask for a dissolution and her majesty would oblige. To get an early election, the government would have to engineer a confidence vote and deliberately lose it. That would look strange. It might try to repeal the Act, but that could run into trouble in the Lords. Alternatively, an election can be triggered if two-thirds of MPs vote to have one. That would be hard for the opposition parties to frustrate. As one senior Labour figure puts it: \u201cOppositions don\u2019t vote against elections.\u201d</p> <p>Labour and the Lib Dems, having both called for an election when Mrs May became prime minister, would find it difficult to explain why they didn\u2019t want one. You might think that Labour would nevertheless try to prevent an election when its poll rating is so dire and the Tories <a href=\"https://www.icmunlimited.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/2016_oct2_guardian.pdf\" title=\"\">have a robust lead</a> often in double figures. Mrs May is <a href=\"https://www.the guardian.com/politics/2016/oct/22/twice-voters-theresa-may-jeremy-corbyn-economy-brexit%E2%80%94opinium-observer-poll\" title=\"\">trusted by more than twice as many voters</a> as Jeremy Corbyn to run the economy successfully and handle Brexit effectively.</p> <p>That suggests an election would see the obliteration of a substantial chunk of Labour MPs. Yet such is the state of the party that a surprisingly large number of its MPs ache for an election, if only to be put out of their misery. \u201cI guess about half of my colleagues secretly want an early election,\u201d says one Labour MP. \u201cThey think, \u2018What the hell, let\u2019s roll the dice, things couldn\u2019t be any worse.\u2019\u201d Though they could, you know. An election in the first half of next year is not yet a certainty, but it has become quite a lot likelier. And, unusually, although for very different reasons, it would be welcome to many MPs on both sides of the Commons.</p> <p>I also detect a subtle, but significant, change in the language coming out of Downing Street when it is asked the question. On Friday, a Number 10 spokesperson declared: \u201cWe have been very clear: there is no requirement for a general election before 2020.\u201d That\u2019s not really clear at all. That\u2019s not the same as saying that there definitely won\u2019t be one. There\u2019s no requirement for me to have steak and chips for my dinner, but I might choose to do so all the same.</p>",

Were you to draw a Venn diagram of the three groups whose interaction defines the modern-day Democratic party \u2013 liberals, meritocrats and plutocrats \u2013 the space where they intersect would be an island seven miles off the coast of Massachusetts called Martha\u2019s Vineyard.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1e3b7c69db4a0986f05d80fe34954ce503ea3305\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1e3b7c69db4a0986f05d80fe34954ce503ea3305/0_0_3008_2000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A patriotic house in Martha's Vineyard\" width=\"1000\" height=\"665\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Flying the flag in Martha\u2019s Vineyard \u2013 a place of yachts, celebrities and closed-off beaches.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A little bit smaller in area than Staten Island but many times greater in magnitude of wealth, Martha\u2019s Vineyard is a resort whose population swells each summer as the wealthy return to their vacation villas. It is a place of yachts and celebrities and fussy shrubbery; of waterfront mansions and Ivy League professors and closed-off beaches. The markers of lifestyle enlightenment are all around you: foods that are organic. Clothing that is tasteful. A conspicuous absence of cigarette butts. Sometimes, the perversity of the place is capable of slapping you right in the face. I was reminded of this as I strolled through one of the polished, stately towns on Martha\u2019s Vineyard and came across a shop selling reproductions of old T-shirts, sports memorabilia and the like. On the outside wall of the shop hung a poem by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/mar/24/charles-bukowski-on-cats-book-published\">Charles Bukowski</a>, because, of course, nothing goes better with tasteful clothing than transgressive poetry. It\u2019s about the horror of blue-collar life, about \u201cmen I\u2019ve known\u201d who work in factories and who do the kind of dehumanising labour that no one who passes by here ever does any more.</p> <p>When I think of the men I\u2019ve known who work in factories, I often think of a group of locked-out workers I met in Decatur, Illinois, in 1994, during the early days of the Bill Clinton administration. Their quintessentially average town was embroiled in three industrial actions: in addition to a lockout at Tate &amp; Lyle\u2019s Staley plant, there were strikes at Caterpillar and at Firestone. The contests grew bitter; the police grew violent; the workers made common cause with one another; people started referring to Decatur as the \u201cwar zone\u201d.</p> <p>What they meant by this phrase was not merely that cops could be mean, but that capitalism had declared war on blue-collar prosperity itself. As a locked-out worker told me in 1994, after reflecting on industrial struggles of the past: \u201cNow it\u2019s our turn. And if we don\u2019t do it, then the middle class as we know it in this country will die. There will be two classes and it will be the very very poor and the very very rich.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7a34db05701005f475596d6ec45d1bfdbfa591d4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7a34db05701005f475596d6ec45d1bfdbfa591d4/0_173_3043_1826/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Striking UAW members picket the Caterpillar factory in Decatur, Illinois in November 1991.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Striking UAW members picket the Caterpillar factory in Decatur, Illinois in November 1991.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Seth Perlman/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Was he ever right about that. In a scholarly paper about social class published in 1946, the sociologist <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/22115\">C Wright Mills</a> found that \u201cbig business and executives\u201d in Decatur earned a little more than two times as much as the town\u2019s \u201cwage workers\u201d. In 2014, by contrast, the CEO of Archer Daniels Midland, a company that dominates Decatur today, earned an estimated 261 times as much as average-wage workers. The CEO of Caterpillar, the focus of one of the \u201cwar-zone\u201d strikes, made 486 times as much. Caterpillar\u2019s share price, meanwhile, is roughly 10 times what it was at the time of the strike.</p> <p>Other changes to sweep that town since the war-zone days of the 90s are just as familiar, just as awful. For one thing, Decatur\u2019s population has shrunk by about 12% since then. Despite this outflow of people, in early 2015, the place still had the highest unemployment rate in Illinois.</p> <p>In 2015, I went back to Decatur to catch up with veterans of the war zone such as Larry Solomon, who had been the leader of the local <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/sep/13/new-generation-of-united-auto-workers-push-to-end-second-tier-union-status\">United Automobile Workers</a> union at the Caterpillar plant. He went back in after the strike ended but retired in 1998. When I met Solomon in his tidy suburban home, he talked in detail about the many times he got crossways with management in days long past, about all the grievances he filed for his co-workers over the years and all the puffed-up company officials he recalls facing down.</p> <p>Think about that for a moment: a blue-collar worker who has retired fairly comfortably, despite having spent years confronting his employer on picket lines and in grievance hearings. How is such a thing possible? I know we\u2019re all supposed to show nothing but love for the job creators nowadays, but listening to Solomon, it occurred to me that maybe his attitude worked better. Maybe it was that attitude, repeated in workplace after workplace across the country, which made possible the middle-class prosperity that once marked America as a nation.</p> <p>\u201cWe were promised, all during the time we worked at Caterpillar, that when you retire, you\u2019re going to have a pension and full benefits at no cost to you,\u201d Solomon recalled. He told about a round of contract negotiations he and his colleagues attended in the 1960s during which a management official complained: \u201cWe already take care of you from the cradle to the grave. What more could you want?\u201d</p> <p>Today, that old social contract is gone or, at least, the part of it that ensured healthcare and retirement for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/10/zero-hours-contracts-worse-jobs-for-life-work-unions\">blue-collar workers</a>. Now, as Solomon sees it, companies can say: \u201cWe want your life, and when your work life is over, then goodbye. We thank you for your life, but we\u2019re not responsible for you after we turn you out.\u201d</p> <p>Mike Griffin had been another outspoken union activist, in his case during the lockout at Tate &amp; Lyle. When we met up last year, we talked about the situation that faces the younger generation in Decatur, people for whom the basic components of middle-class life are growing further and further out of reach. Though they might not always get it politically, Griffin said, those workers can most definitely see how screwed they are. \u201cOne of the things that they do understand is that they got shit jobs with shit wages and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/apr/09/federal-contract-workers-complaint-new-minimum-wage-standard\">no benefits and no health insurance</a>,\u201d he told me.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cafe92c586e5ca8b6142e085c542644eb273e2b4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cafe92c586e5ca8b6142e085c542644eb273e2b4/0_353_4268_2760/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Supporters of a $15 minimum wage for fast food workers rally in front of a McDonald\u2019s in Albany, New York State.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"647\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Supporters of a $15 minimum wage for fast food workers rally in front of a McDonald\u2019s in Albany, New York State.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mike Groll/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cAnd they understand,\u201d he continued, \u201cthat they\u2019re working two and three jobs just to get by, a lot of them can\u2019t own anything and they understand seeing Mom and Dad forced into retirement or forced out of their job, now they\u2019re working at <a href=\"http://www.hardees.com/\">Hardee\u2019s</a> or McDonald\u2019s to make ends meet so they can retire in poverty. People understand that. They see that.\u201d</p> <p>Those awful words are a fairly accurate account of the situation faced by a vast part of the population in America, a population that was brought up expecting to enjoy life in what it is often told is the richest country in the world. It is not really the fault of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/04/obama-support-minimum-wage-inequality-speech\">Barack Obama</a> or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/07/clinton-era-welfare-reforms-american-poor-bernie-sanders\">Bill Clinton</a> that things have unfolded in such a lousy way for these people. As everyone knows, it is the Republicans that ushered the world into the neoliberal age; that cut the taxes of the rich with a kind of religious conviction; that did so much to unleash Wall Street and deregulate everything else; that declared eternal war on the welfare state.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/04/obama-support-minimum-wage-inequality-speech\">Obama throws support to minimum wage movement in economy speech</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But history works in strange ways. Another thing the Republicans did, beginning in the late 60s, was to present themselves as the party of ordinary, unaffected people, of what Richard Nixon (and now Donald Trump) called the \u201csilent majority\u201d. They cast the war between right and left as a kind of inverted class struggle, in which humble, hard-working, God-fearing citizens would choose to align themselves with the party of Herbert Hoover.</p> <p>And so Republicans smashed unions and cut the taxes of the rich even as they praised blue-collar citizens for their patriotism and their \u201cfamily values\u201d. Working-class \u201cReagan Democrats\u201d left their party to back a man who performed enormous favours for the wealthy and who did more than anyone to usher the world into its modern course of accelerating inequality.</p> <p>Everything in those decades seemed to be a class issue, everything, that is, except matters of economics and distribution, where free-market orthodoxy prevailed. In 2004, I went back to my home state of Kansas to ask why it had moved so far to the right since the days of Dwight Eisenhower; the answer, I discovered, was the culture wars \u2013 abortion, gun control, obscenity, education and so on.</p> <p>And beneath every one of these culture war issues lay the burning insult of snobbery. A \u201cliberal elite\u201d, it seemed, was forever conspiring against the values of ordinary people, telling them what to do and how to do it without any concern for what they actually believed. The best thing about the culture wars was that they required the Republicans to deliver very little to their growing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/mar/07/donald-trump-why-americans-support\">blue-collar base</a>; the wars were unwinnable almost by definition, a matter of entertainment rather than politics in the traditional sense. The ones who got tangible gains out of this form of populism were the party\u2019s clients among the business elite.</p> <p>In the decades I am describing, Republicans also perfected the ugly art of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/21/trump-clinton-gun-control-policies-race-policing\">concealed racist appeal</a>, which helped them to win many of the southern states and plenty of white votes in other places and whose echoes we hear so distinctly in the Trump campaign. Between that nasty strategy and the working-class outreach I am describing, Republicans enjoyed years of electoral success. At the top of the party structure stood the interests it served \u2013 big business, the very rich \u2013 and at the bottom was its mass constituency, which seemed to grow more proletarian and more frustrated as the years passed.</p> <p>This mixture of cultural populism and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/04/donald-trump-bernie-sanders-brexit-anti-establishment-politics\">free-market orthodoxy</a> was not a stable one. Doing favours for the rich while encouraging fruitless, culture-based class grievances among working people was a contradiction difficult to sustain, a delicate balancing act that could only be pulled off as long as the economy stayed reasonably good and the price tag of inequality remained bearable.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/dec/28/markets-credit-crunch-banking-2008\">financial crisis of 2008</a> and the lingering recession shattered the whole thing. By 2016, as blue-collar wages continued to stagnate and inequality to worsen, the base of the Republican party had lost its appetite for pointless culture crusades: they demanded something real. And of the 17 Republican candidates for president this year, Donald Trump offered exactly that.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/04/donald-trump-bernie-sanders-brexit-anti-establishment-politics\">Trump, Brexit and demand for change: the year of the political outsider</a> </p> </aside>  <p>He railed against a rotten political establishment that did nothing for working people; he promised to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/21/guardian-view-on-us-presidency-time-is-right-for-female-leader-hillary-clinton\">defend social security</a> and to renegotiate the trade deals that are widely blamed for the deindustrialisation of the midwest. He also scapegoated <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/oct/31/peter-thiel-defends-donald-trump-muslim-ban-mexico-wall\">Muslims and illegal immigrants</a>, blaming them falsely for all manner of offences. And he did it all in the bluntest terms, with a self-absorbed way of speaking that somehow captured the imagination of this unhappy era. Even his grotesque, bombastic style seemed to confirm his appeal; at the Republican convention in July, I heard him described as a \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/22/republican-reaction-donald-trump-speech-convention\">blue-collar billionaire</a>\u201d.</p> <p>From one perspective, Trump\u2019s rise has merely marked the evolution of Republican populism. It has always been a form of entertainment, and Trump is a captivating entertainer. Traditional Republican leaders, however, regard Trump as a pariah, thanks to his market-offending stands on trade, social security and bank regulation. These leaders have abandoned him in droves, while he has promised to remake the Republicans into a \u201cworkers\u2019 party.\u201d</p> <p>But what has also made Trumpism possible is the simultaneous evolution of the Democrats, the traditional workers\u2019 party, over the period I have been describing. They went from being the party of Decatur to the party of Martha\u2019s Vineyard and they did so at roughly the same time that the Republicans were sharpening their deadly image of the \u201cliberal elite\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b70e18ca01d3a772107cfc0f3709611da7670155\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b70e18ca01d3a772107cfc0f3709611da7670155/0_16_3921_2353/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton at a CNN Democratic presidential debate\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton at a TV debate: the Democratic party has \u2018mounted notable efforts to cajole or shame\u2019 young former Sanders supporters to vote for Clinton.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Locher/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And so the reversal is complete and the worst choice ever is upon us.

  "<p>Barring a huge upset against England in London next weekend, Australia have booked their place in the Four Nations final with a 14-8 victory over New Zealand.</p> <p>Who can stop this Australia side? Since Mal Meninga has come on board the<br>Kangaroos have romped to four straight wins, three over the Kiwis and one over<br>minnows Scotland. They have racked up 110 points and conceded just 26 in a<br>number of dominant performances in both hemispheres.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/nov/05/new-zealand-australia-four-nations-rugby-league-report\">Australia defy New Zealand grandstand finish for Four Nations triumph</a> </p> </aside>  <p>At a cold Ricoh Arena they looked imperious for 40 minutes, Michael Morgan and<br>Jonathan Thurston running rings around the opposition, Blake Ferguson and<br>Valentine Holmes terrorising the flanks and big boppers David Klemmer, Matt<br>Scott and Shannon Boyd causing mayhem in the middle.</p> <p>At 10-0 at the break in Coventry the Kangaroos were flying. The second half was<br>a different story, and it should have been a comfortable victory if not for the<br>magical wand of Shaun Johnson. The Warriors playmaker set up one brilliant try<br>and almost scored one on the hooter, which would have snatched the unlikeliest<br>of draws. But it would have been an underserved result as Australia dominated<br>most of the match and went into cruise control in the final quarter.</p> <p>The contrast between this Four Nations and two years ago could not be greater.<br>In that tournament the green and gold were knocked off twice by New Zealand,<br>in the first match of the competition and again <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/nov/15/four-nations-final-new-zealand-australia-report\">in the final</a>. They came into it<br>missing a host of players but were still confident, arrogant even, they could get the job done with a second-string side. They had smashed the Kiwis at the World Cup at Old Trafford \u2013 Sonny Bill-Williams, Johnson, Kieran Foran, the lot in 2013. One year later, how much could change?</p> <p>How wrong they could be. In both matches two years ago they were outplayed<br>and out-enthused by the Kiwis. The bigger Kiwi pack beat up the Aussie<br>forwards. Johnson dazzled. The loss of the Four Nations title spelled the end of<br>Tim Sheens\u2019 reign as coach and started some soul-searching in Australia rugby<br>league. Were the Kangaroos no longer the best team on the planet? Was their<br>divine right to the mantle as the world\u2019s best no longer warranted?</p> <p>Defeat in the Anzac Test at Suncorp in 2015 launched even more questions. The Kiwis had beaten Australia three times in a row, the first time in a whopping 62 years. Phil Gould opined that New Zealand were now the preeminent force in international footy and would be for years to come. He called for a speedy rejuvenation of the ageing Aussie lineup, a time for the veterans to be cleaned out and new blood to be thrown in.</p> <p>Out went Sheens and in came Meninga, fresh from his stint as State of Origin\u2019s most successful coach. The man who went on more Kangaroo tours than anyone else promised to bring the passion and pride back into the national team. Origin had stolen the focus, the spotlight, the prestige, hell even the money from the international game. No longer, said Big Mal.</p> <p>Less than a year after his appointment and four games in, Meninga\u2019s methods are<br>clearly working. The Origin tensions, supposed divisions between those players<br>from NSW and Queensland who try to rip each other\u2019s heads off in an intense<br>three-game series every year, seems to be gone. The team is united, content and<br>together. The rookies have stepped up from NRL to Test level seamlessly. The<br>Kangaroos\u2019 tremendous depth in every position is causing the opposition<br>nightmares.</p> <p>James Maloney had to wait to the age of 30 to get his first cap for Australia, but<br>the five-eighth has never played better footy in his life than right now. Valentine<br>Holmes might only be 21 be he looks like he\u2019s been playing international rugby<br>league for years. In Coventry Ferguson went up another level, claiming the man<br>of the match award, while Morgan was outstanding as Thurston\u2019s halves partner.<br>The absent Cooper Cronk, the joint winner of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/29/cronk-taumalolo-share-nrl-dally-m-medal\">the 2016 Dally M award</a>, was not missed.</p> <p>Confident, committed, ruthless and ridiculously talented, this Australian side will<br>take some stopping. They can play in second gear against the team currently<br>ranked number one in the world, an outfit than can boast stars like Johnson,<br>Jason Taumalolo and a brutal forward pack, and still win. Worryingly for the rest<br>of the world, they also remained grounded and humble. After the game, both Meninga and captain Cameron Smith were quick to remind the media that the Kangaroos weren\u2019t at the best, and of the danger of their trans-Tasman neighbours. Smith reckons his side was at \u201c75% to 80%\u201d of its capabilities.<br></p> <p>That begs the question \u2013 how good can they be? How much improvement do they have left in them? This is a squad that left out Andrew Fifita, Corey Parker, Paul Gallen, Semi Radradra and overlooked a number of others \u2013 Jarryd Hayne, Anthony Milford and more. It\u2019s one that possesses at least three future Immortals and others who have already achieved everything possible in the game. Comparisons with the Invincibles from 1982 might be folly, a stretch or just plain wrong. That Aussie team of Wally Lewis, Peter Sterling, Brett Kenny, Wayne Pearce, Meninga and the rest changed the way rugby league was played, it revolutionised the sport. There will probably never be another Kangaroo squad like them in the years to cone.</p> <p>But this 2016 edition is fearsome, freakish and downright fantastic. At their best<br>they are a sight to behold. All signs point to a comfortable win over in England in<br>seven days time and then a final victory over New Zealand at Anfield. Big Mal is<br>emboldening this team with that awesome spirit of their forbearers. Only to what lofty heights the 56-year old will take them remains to be seen.</p>",
  "<p>\u201cWe don\u2019t say the A-word here anymore,\u201d a social worker once told me when I dared to ask why there are hardly any adoptions in Australia.</p> <p>But, with our <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/22/labor-criticises-85m-reform-plans-for-foster-care-homes-after-girl-x-failures\">foster care system in crisis</a>, it\u2019s time to talk about an alternative option for the increasing number of children removed from their home due to abuse or neglect.</p> <p>Adoption is so tainted by its dark history in Australia that it remains a taboo. To many, it conjures images of rich white couples sauntering into orphanages, picking out the cutest brown babies and whisking them away before the impoverished birth mothers know what\u2019s happened.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/06/queensland-proposes-new-laws-for-same-sex-couples-to-adopt-children\">Queensland proposes new laws for same-sex couples to adopt children</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In reality, many ordinary Australians spend years fighting bureaucracy and making sacrifices to earn the right to take care of traumatised children nobody else wants.</p> <p>It is appropriate that National Adoption Awareness Week<em> </em>in Australia coincides with Hillary Clinton\u2019s likely election as president. </p> <p>Clinton helped transform the US child protection system to favour (permanent) adoption of children in preference to (temporary) foster care.</p> <p>In her 1996 book, It Takes a Village, she expressed concern at the number of kids yo-yoing between different homes. She highlighted the need to \u201cmake decisions about terminating parental rights of abusive parents more quickly, rather than removing and returning abused children time and again\u201d.</p> <p>Her work underpinned the Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997, signed by the then president, Bill Clinton. The new law provided for fast-tracking of decisions on permanency for children. Importantly, the reforms included provisions for financial assistance for both birth families (to help them keep their kids) and adoptive families (for post-care support).</p> <p>The Washington Post hailed the act as \u201c<a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/daily/april99/fosterlaw011898.htm\">the most significant change in federal child protection policy in almost two decades</a>\u201d because it turned an adult-focused system into one that made child safety a \u201cparamount concern\u201d. The new law led to a big drop in the number of children in foster care and a corresponding rise in those adopted.</p> <p>Australia has moved in the opposite direction. The number of children in foster care has skyrocketed \u2013 there are now 43,000 kids living without a permanent home. Many spend their entire childhood being handballed from one placement to another before transiting <a href=\"http://vcoss.org.au/documents/2013/06/Insight.CheStockley.Final_.pdf\">into juvenile justice</a>. Yet there were fewer than 100 foster care adoptions last year and just seven outside NSW.</p> <p>Adoption is not viable for all foster kids. Some have been so damaged by constant moves and <a href=\"https://www.childabuseroyalcommission.gov.au/case-study/cde18d1b-fade-43f4-83f4-46e9af48b543/case-study-24,-march-2015,-sydney\">re-abuse in care</a>, they\u2019re now unable to settle in a family home. Others remain emotionally attached to birth families and could be returned if it weren\u2019t for our woeful underfunding of social support services. </p> <p>But there\u2019s a third subset of children whose parents are deceased, remorsefully abusive or simply unwilling to care for them. In most states, adoption is not pursued even for them.</p> <p>This is typified by the case of the former AFL player Brad Murphy, who grew up in state care because his dad was in jail and his mum didn\u2019t want him. He desperately wanted to be adopted by his loving foster parents but the Victorian government wouldn\u2019t allow it because his birth father wouldn\u2019t provide consent.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/dec/17/adoption-at-all-time-low-in-australia-because-of-focus-on-family-reunion\">Adoption at all-time low in Australia 'because of focus on family reunion'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Murphy remained in the oxymoronic state of \u201cpermanent care\u201d, where care rights are granted to one family for 18 years. Such rights can be challenged in court. He was in constant fear of hearing a knock on the door from someone who might take him away. He felt he never truly belonged to anyone. His athletic prowess and determination allowed him to become a rare foster care success story but he\u2019s aware of four others who transited through his home that have since taken their own life. </p> <p>Australia\u2019s pre-1980s history of forced adoptions \u2013 where Aboriginal and single women were coerced into handing over their babies and denied future contact \u2013 helps explain today\u2019s status quo. NSW has been the only state to pursue pro-adoption reforms and this led to cries <a href=\"http://www.wlsnsw.org.au/wp-content/uploads/Child-protection-Open-letter-to-Minister-Gowardf.pdf\">that government is once again trying to steal children</a>.</p> <p>But adoption as practised today is different from the past. Laws mandate transparency and contact with birth families is maintained wherever possible. Indeed, there is so much rigour and paperwork that an adoption takes, on average, four years to process, according to the lobby group Adopt Change. This deters many prospective adoptive parents. If state bureaucrats are trying to steal children, they ought to appear on an episode of World\u2019s Dumbest Criminals.</p> <p>Four years is a long, uncertain time in the life of child. There is an urgent need for laws, practices and attitudes to change to put children\u2019s interests first and enable timely processing of adoption for those who want it. On this issue, we are 20 years behind Clinton. Our most vulnerable children should wait no longer.</p> <p><em>National Adoption Awareness Week is between 6 and 12 November.</em></p>",

Taylor said that in previous interviews for his book, republished in paperback in January, Hedren said the director had taught her all she knew about films, even allowing her into script meetings for <em>The Birds</em>.</p> <p>Taylor and a fellow Hitchcock expert, Tony Lee Moral, author of <em>Hitchcock and the Making of Marnie</em> and <em>The Making of Hitchcock\u2019s The Birds</em>, both argue that Hedren\u2019s claims are not supported by others who worked on the films, or by the shooting schedules and other documents in Hitchcock\u2019s archive at the <a href=\"https://www.oscars.org/library\" title=\"\">Margaret Herrick Library</a> in Los Angeles.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBnhC8Eer8M\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/oBnhC8Eer8M?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>The Birds trailer</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Hedren, mother of 1980s film star Melanie Griffith and grandmother to Dakota Johnson, the star of last year\u2019s <em>Fifty Shades of Grey</em>, claims that during location filming of <em>The Birds</em>, Hitchcock gave her a ride to her motel in his limousine and tried to kiss her while others&#xa0;watched.</p> <p>She repelled his advances, she writes, and alleges he took his revenge the next day when they filmed the famous telephone booth scene in which birds break in to attack the star. The glass booth\u2019s supposedly shatterproof panes splintered, cutting her cheek, and Hedren suggests the sequence was part punishment for her rejection of him.</p> <p>The allegation about Hitchcock\u2019s attempted kiss came to light in 2008 in Donald Spoto\u2019s book, <em>Spellbound by Beauty</em>, which inspired the 2012 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/jan/11/hitchcock-the-girl-truth-master-suspense\" title=\"\">television film <em>The Girl</em></a>, starring Sienna Miller as Hedren and Toby Jones as Hitchcock.</p> <p>The film provoked protests from those who worked with Hitchcock when it was broadcast and these <a href=\"https://savehitchcock.com/\" title=\"\">objections have intensified</a> in response to Hedren\u2019s new memoir. The reputation of Britain\u2019s greatest film director, fear Taylor and Lee Moral, is being tarnished by allegations that do not stand up. After speaking to surviving members of the film crew on <em>The Birds</em>, Lee Moral believes the record should be set straight. \u201cShooting documents show there was months of studio filming between the time when she was staying in that motel and the phone booth filming,\u201d he told the <em>Observer</em>. \u201cIt also happened a few days after Hedren was offered the part of <em>Marnie,</em> which makes even less sense.\u201d</p> <p>Taylor adds that onlookers, such as assistant director Jim Brown and Hitchcock\u2019s assistant, Peggy Robertson, have never mentioned the limo incident when offering other criticisms of the director. He also questions why Hitchcock would have risked disfiguring his new star during an expensive shoot.</p> <p>Gerry Gero, assistant to Ray Berwick the bird trainer, has backed this view, while Hedren\u2019s hairdresser, Virginia Darcy, is on record agreeing that the crew \u201cwere all looking out for her\u201d.</p> <p>Only two chapters in the new memoir are about Hitchcock, who died in 1980, as most of the book chronicles Hedren\u2019s passion for filming with lions and other big cats and the creation of her wildlife reserve near the Mohave desert.</p> <p>The biggest row between director and his star, all parties agree, was over Hedren\u2019s plan to attend an awards event in New York held by <em>Photoplay Magazine</em> in February 1964, during the filming of <em>Marnie</em>, an intense pyschological thriller about abuse co-starring Sean Connery. Hedren\u2019s memoir maintains she requested a long weekend away, but Lee Moral claims the records in the Los Angeles library show the awards evening was held in the middle of a week of scheduled filming.</p> <p>A memo from Universal publicity manager David Golding sent in January advised Hitchcock that it was impractical for Hedren to fly to New York. Connery was scheduled to begin filming as Bond in <em>Goldfinger</em> in March and there was no room for postponements. Hitchcock also did not want Hedren to break the taut atmosphere on the <em>Marnie</em> set.</p> <p>Louise Latham, who played Marnie\u2019s mother, told Lee Moral she had sympathy for Hitchcock. \u201cI find some of the allegations hard to believe. She\u2019s a lovely woman, but I don\u2019t think Tippi should have said those things about Hitch \u2026 I wasn\u2019t aware of her being hassled on the set. For Hitchcock to go down as this monstrous thing, to the degree that [Tippi] was vulnerable is not accurate.\u201d</p> <p>Taylor told the <em>Observer</em> he once asked Hitchcock about the row and was told that Hedren had said something no one was permitted to say: \u201cWell, she, ahem, referred to my weight.\u201d Robertson later told him Hedren had shouted: \u201cYou fat pig. Who are you to tell me what I can and can\u2019t do!\u201d</p>",
  "<p>If Bono, being a man, is not everyone\u2019s ideal <a href=\"http://www.glamour.com/story/women-of-the-year-bono\" title=\"\">Woman of the Year</a>, the publishers of <em>Glamour</em> magazine, Cond\u00e9 Nast, should be congratulated on stimulating a sudden surge of interest in a title that, contending with a generally declining sector, amid a welter of competing awards, definitely needed the attention. Take a bow, Cond\u00e9 Nast executives Charles, Robert, Anna (Wintour), David and Fred. Like Bono, you guys (and Anna) remind us, in the words of <em>Glamour</em>\u2019s editor, of the \u201cmany men who really are doing wonderful things for women these days\u201d.</p> <p>The only difficulty will come next year, when <em>Glamour</em> must outdo itself to get noticed or appear to go backwards. Maybe it could make the whole Women of the Year list male, or feature a few brave pets or children in the line-up, assuming that has not already been attempted, given the acute talented woman shortage, by its rivals.</p> <p>Anyway, thousands must have rushed to the <em>Glamour</em> website, the better to comprehend how Bono, the singer, humanitarian and pious tax-avoider, had beaten all contenders, male and female to this honour, and then stayed, as I did, to read its <a href=\"http://www.glamour.com/story/heres-your-love-horoscope-for-november-2016\" title=\"\">Love Horoscopes</a>. It was like going back to 1980. \u201cNovember starts off with Venus travelling through your ambition angle, increasing the appeal of powerful or older men.\u201d Not, you gather, that the current editors of <em>Glamour</em> appear to need any encouragement in that respect.</p> <p>Explaining the Bono award, Cindi Leive, the magazine\u2019s editor, pointed out that this powerful older man, unlike <em>Glamour</em>\u2019s female winners, \u201ccould select any cause in the world to call his own\u201d. Name a noble cause \u2013 peace, the climate, saving honey bees \u2013 and Bono might have chosen it. Yet, like a Mills and Boon surgeon or mighty sheikh, entitled to date only the beautiful, Bono, the tireless philanthropist, a man as revered by world leaders as he is by top accountants, has actively chosen to spend time with the poorest, mousiest, most bespectacled of all causes: women.</p> <p>Can it be true? Yes, writes Cindi: \u201cWhen a major male rock star who could do anything at all with his life decides to focus on the rights of women and girls worldwide \u2013 well, all that\u2019s worth celebrating.\u201d</p> <p><em>Glamour</em> contributor Christiane Amanpour underlined to readers the true significance of this compliment. \u201cBono is making clear that powerful men can, and should, take on these deep-rooted issues.\u201d If his message catches on, maybe the whole feminist business could ultimately be outsourced to powerful men, at least until women get better at doing it themselves?</p> <p>The prizewinner sounded willing enough. \u201cI\u2019m grateful for this award as a chance to say the battle for gender equality can\u2019t be won unless men lead it as well as women,\u201d Bono said. Perhaps aware that this might not sound ideally he-for-she, or even plausible, given the history of, say, the male-dominated, gender-equalising Labour party, he explained: \u201cWe\u2019re largely responsible for the problem, so we have to be involved in the solutions.\u201d Maybe he\u2019s not up to speed with Liam Fox, post-Brexit.</p> <p>So what does gender-equality leadership mean to Bono? By way of a clue, he recently, as an ally of the pope, urged us to \u201c<a href=\"http://aleteia.org/2015/06/04/bono-listen-to-pope-francis-and-it-will-end-corruption-and-hunger/\" title=\"\">listen to Papa Francisco</a>\u201d. Specifically, on eradicating poverty and ending corruption.</p> <p>Though the contrast between Bono\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/may/15/bono-defends-u2-corporation-tax-arrangements\" title=\"\">fascinating taxation arrangements</a> and his objections to those of, say, Exxon Mobil will not disqualify him, in all women\u2019s eyes, from being their gender-equality leader, <em>Glamour</em> might have looked more closely at Papa Francisco\u2019s latest statements on women priests. With a notable unwillingness, unlike <em>Glamour</em>\u2019s Women of the Year judges, to challenge tradition, the pope has just reaffirmed that since Jesus\u2019s apostles were men, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/01/pope-francis-women-never-roman-catholic-priests-church\" title=\"\">women must forever be second-class </a>believers.</p> <p>Then again, with <em>Glamour</em>\u2019s new interest in paternalism, we can\u2019t rule out the possibility that the pope is bang on trend. The idea that men enjoy too much power, and thus have no place on all-women shortlists, is, Cindi Leive explained, \u201can outdated way of looking at things\u201d. Actually, <em>Glamour</em>\u2019s excitement about getting its hands on Bono was more redolent than anything of <em>Cosmo</em>, in the magazine era when Helen Gurley Brown was writing articles such as \u201cHow to Get Men to Give You Presents\u201d. \u201cHe talks, you listen,\u201d she once said, on pleasing men. \u201cYou can talk to your girlfriends, your boss, your secretary. But you may not do all the talking you would like to do with him.\u201d It was a process she called \u201csinking in\u201d. For all Gurley Brown\u2019s boosterish words on female independence, her biographer, Gerri Hirshey, has written: \u201cShe was a realist, not a revolutionary.\u201d</p> <p>To be fair to <em>Glamour</em>\u2019s judges, though no previous woman\u2019s award panel has done as much to reach out to the rich, entitled, white men routinely excluded from all-women awards, they were not the first to suggest that the women\u2019s movement could benefit from alpha \u2013 even beta \u2013 male approval.</p> <p>Had they sounded more like Emma Watson, or picked Obama, rather than Papa Francisco\u2019s co-worker, as their first-ever male woman of the year, the magazine might have enjoyed the sort of delirious reception that recently greeted the president\u2019s identification of himself as <a href=\"http://www.glamour.com/story/glamour-exclusive-president-barack-obama-says-this-is-what-a-feminist-looks-like\" title=\"\">a male feminist</a>. It would be difficult for any feminist to resist that quality of leadership alliance, not that Obama would have been so tone deaf as to propose one. Maybe it does not need saying, outside <em>Glamour</em>, that any male feminist who volunteers to represent feminists, as opposed to join them, either does not get feminism or is having a laugh.</p> <p>As with <em>Glamour</em> snagging Bono, and campaigners who believed Russell Brand to be an anti-Page 3 asset, <em>Elle</em> and the Fawcett Society were well pleased, a couple of years ago, when they got Ed Miliband, Nick Clegg, and assorted successful men, to model <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/oct/27/david-cameron-this-is-not-what-a-feminist-looks-like\" title=\"\">This is What a Feminist Looks Like</a> T-shirts.</p> <p>Even then, there was an obvious issue of quality control, not to speak of the contradictions. If a man owed his prominence to discrimination against women, why seek his blessing? And whether or not you liked, or respected them, how was the support of two doomed losers \u2013 Miliband being already among the most unpopular Labour leaders in history \u2013 not more advantageous to them than to feminism? How comically mediocre did men have to be before it outweighed the great prize of their maleness? Miliband, whose traceless ascent came courtesy of all-male Blair and Brown elites, went on to demonstrate his feminist commitment by relying on almost exclusively male advice in his tragic \u201cEd Stone\u201d election campaign. The legacy of his fellow feminist, Clegg, would be a party of eight men and another discarded T-shirt.</p> <p>As for the more sought-after male feminists, notably Benedict Cumberbatch, the very exultation over their recruitment only added to an impression of girlish longing for male approval: see, an important man likes us! Bono likes us! There\u2019s glamour for you.</p>",
  "<p>Once upon a time, a long, long, long time ago, small children might get told off for being loud or unruly or, as we called it then, \u201cdisruptive\u201d. Now? Not so much. In 2016, it\u2019s cool to be disruptive. It\u2019s what every startup in Silicon Valley is straining to do.</p> <p>It\u2019s what Airbnb has done \u2013 disrupting the hotel industry as Uber has disrupted taxis and Amazon has disrupted bookshops and almost everything else. Two years ago I went to a conference in San Francisco, TechCrunch Disrupt, and met many people claiming to disrupt many things, including, in one case, socks.</p> <p>But what no one anticipated was that, though it may be convenient to summon a motor vehicle to one\u2019s home with a tap of a button or to buy things online while wearing pyjamas and possibly drunk, it might also lead to where we are now: 6 November 2016. Two days, potentially, before the world changes forever.</p> <p>Because Donald Trump is not just an over-tanned reality-TV star gone rogue. He is not a weaponised version of Lord Sugar. He is what happens when technology changes everything. \u201cDisruption,\u201d wrote Clayton Christensen, the professor at Harvard Business School who coined the idea, is the \u201ctechnology mudslide hypothesis\u201d. It\u2019s how some scrappy little upstart like Microsoft overthrew the colossus that once was IBM. It\u2019s how some small new technological breakthrough can have huge, unexpected, world-changing consequences.</p> <p>It\u2019s Donald Trump. The living, breathing version of the scrappy little upstart that overturns an entire industry. Only this time it\u2019s not an industry, it\u2019s democracy.</p> <p>We have fetishised \u201cdisruption\u201d. Governments have stood by and watched it take down all industries in its path \u2013 the market must do what the market must do. Only now, the wave is breaking on its shore.</p> <p>Because what the last week of this presidential campaign has shown us is that technology has disrupted, is disrupting, is threatening to upturn the democratic process itself \u2013 the best, most stable, most equitable form of governance the world has yet come up with.</p> <p>In many crucial ways, it doesn\u2019t even matter who wins on Tuesday because perhaps the best thing you can say about Trump is that if it hadn\u2019t been him it would have been someone else. It\u2019s the opposite of the Great Man theory of history: a misogynistic ex-reality TV star is not the game-changer here, it\u2019s technology.</p> <p>Two days ago, the same hackers who took down Twitter and Netflix and the <em>Guardian</em> and Reddit and CNN last week in the biggest attack of its kind that the world has ever seen, started practising on a country. Computer malware had been used to infect inanimate objects in our homes \u2013 the connected devices that comprise the so-called internet of things and that, it\u2019s been discovered, a bit late, are hopelessly insecure.</p> <p>It has harnessed these to create a gigantic internet-destroying machine, the so-called Mirai botnet, and it\u2019s honing its power. Last week it took aim at an entire country \u2013 Liberia. A huge attack was launched against the two companies that own the only fibre going into the west African country \u2014 bringing its entire internet infrastructure to a halt.</p> <p>The worst case scenario? That the hackers behind it are \u201cpractising\u201d for Tuesday, when they\u2019ll aim their massed computing power against America.</p> <p>This is everyday objects in our own homes, \u201csmart\u201d objects, intenet-enabled toasters and refrigerators. Because this is where we are: our toasters and refrigerators may be about to be used to subvert the democratic process of the greatest democracy on Earth.</p> <p>And if that reads like the most lunatic sentence you\u2019ve ever read, you maybe haven\u2019t been paying close enough attention to 2016.</p> <p>Because this is possibly, finally, the year when it hits home that technology is not just some cool titanium-coloured gadget in our pockets. It\u2019s the facilitator of the degraded news space that treats facts and lies the same. That has enabled thousands of Twitterbots \u2013 algorithms \u2013 to scrape the internet for stories about Trump and then retweet them.</p> <p>It was robot accounts that caused \u201c#TrumpWon\u201d to trend after each TV debate and allowed Trump to claim \u201cvictory\u201d.</p> <p>It\u2019s how a man who hasn\u2019t set foot on the street for four years, can, with just his laptop, create havoc in the critical last week of the campaign. By leaking emails that potentially implicate Hillary Clinton, Julian Assange has inserted himself \u2013 like computer malware \u2014 into the heart of the American democratic process. He\u2019s infected it. He is, like Donald Trump, the law of unintended consequences writ large, in human form.</p> <p>In 2010, we didn\u2019t mind the fact that the data he leaked was stolen. Here in the liberal press, we championed it. Because it was stolen data that served to underscore our liberal sensibilities. Or, at least mine. And now? Not so much.</p> <p>But then technology is neutral. There is no left or right. There is only hackers and Twitterbots and 16-year-olds in Macedonia who, Buzzfeed reported last week, earn money via Google AdSense for writing made-up stories about Trump and making them go viral on Facebook.</p> <p>In a single Macedonian town \u2014 Veles \u2013 there are at least 140 websites about American politics run by Macedonian kids who make money from fabricated stories. Teenagers can earn up to $5,000 a month by making up things about Trump. They don\u2019t care about Trump or Clinton or anyone else. They\u2019ve just worked out what the US public wants to read and have found a way of serving it up to them whether it\u2019s true or not.</p> <p>The best way of making money via Google is to write clickbait, and the best clickbait they\u2019ve discovered, the stories that are spread widest and furthest in Facebook and Twitter, are stories about Trump. More specifically, false stories about Trump.</p> <p>Because in 2016 we read the news we want to read. The so-called \u201cfilter bubble\u201d, the means by which Google and Facebook give us more of what we want, or what we already know \u2013 our searches and our newsfeeds are programmed to reflect our previous searches and newsfeeds \u2014 is becoming not so much a bubble as a ghetto. Walled in, closed off, airless.</p> <p>It\u2019s not just that search engines have been shown to influence election results \u2013 the higher up a candidate\u2019s name is listed in any search, the more likely they are to win. It\u2019s also that the less we know about how other people think, the less we know.</p> <p>We\u2019re increasingly living in an echo chamber, exposed only to views which chime with our own. The impression this gives is that everyone is like us, thinks like us, wants to be like us.</p> <p>Yet most people are not like us. Maybe that\u2019s what 2016 has come to teach us. That and the idea that Google and Facebook are out to make the world a better place is both absurd and irrelevant.</p> <p>It doesn\u2019t matter what Mark Zuckerberg wants or what Sergey Brin intends. The people who donated to WikiLeaks didn\u2019t intend to get the first potential female US president investigated by the FBI. Nobody wanted their fridge to bring down CNN.</p> <p>Google didn\u2019t intend to drive all newspapers out of business. It\u2019s just something that is happening along the way.</p> <p>And this time, it\u2019s the big one. The Great Disruption. With Trump the Great Disruptor.</p> <p>Will democracy survive? Will Nato? Is a free and fair election possible in a post-truth world when every word any candidate has ever written can be stolen and exposed and distorted? Who knows?</p> <p>It\u2019s a crapshoot from here on in. Go tell that to your filter bubble. Because that\u2019s all you can do. No one else is listening.</p>",
  "<p>Last Thursday, the chief medical officer, Sally Davies, launched a strident <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/nov/03/chief-medical-officer-obesity-school-warning-letters-parents\" title=\"\">defence</a> of one of the NHS\u2019s controversial anti-childhood obesity policies. From the outrage it inspired in some quarters, you might think that the government was sending thousands of Jamie Oliver robots into the nation\u2019s homes to chuck out the Turkey Twizzlers and stand over parents while they cook 30-minute dinners that actually take two hours.</p> <p>But no, what some parents are up in arms about are local authority letters informing them if their child is overweight or obese. Cue angry media interviews and social media threads where parents tell each other to throw them away.</p> <p>It can\u2019t feel particularly pleasant to have that letter drop on your doormat, but the NHS has issued templates to local authorities, stressing that they should be \u201cnon-judgmental\u201d and \u201cpositively phrased\u201d. The potential to perceive judgment can never be entirely eliminated, though; some parents clearly feel that their parenting choices are being inappropriately questioned by the state.</p> <p>But it seems ridiculous to suggest that we refrain from giving parents critical information about their child\u2019s health for fear of upsetting them. One in five children leaves primary school obese. That\u2019s one in five who faces a lifetime of increased risk of serious health issues and premature death due to dietary and lifestyle choices they had little control over in their childhood. That\u2019s cruel.</p> <p>Some parents have written off the warnings, chalking it up to puppy fat or their child\u2019s \u201csolid frame\u201d. Yes, the BMI measure the government uses isn\u2019t perfect; someone very muscular and carrying little fat can show up as obese. But that\u2019s far more likely to be a problem for the Olympic cycling team than a four-year-old.</p> <p>As chubby has become the new normal, we seem to have lost the ability to judge when children are overweight. A healthy 10-year-old\u2019s ribs should be <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-12226744\" title=\"\">clearly visible\u2019,</a> but many parents would perceive this as being underweight. Studies show that parents are rarely able to <a href=\"http://www.nhs.uk/news/2015/03March/Pages/Parents-fail-to-spot-that-their-kids-are-obese.aspx\" title=\"\">spot obesity</a> in their own children and even health professionals tend to mischaracterise obese children as being of healthy weight based only on photographs.</p> <p>It\u2019s not just the responsibility of parents \u2013 the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/aug/18/childhood-obesity-strategy-wasted-opportunity-campaigners\" title=\"\">government has shamefully backed away</a> from effective measures such as bans on junk-food advertising and forcing manufacturers to reduce fat and sugar levels in foods. But parents must play a role and misperceptions are common. One mum, upset that her child was classified as overweight, said: \u201cTo me, fat kids sit on the couch eating fried food\u2026 she doesn\u2019t even like fried food.\u201d</p> <p>This is perhaps an intuitive view if you\u2019re not a nutritional expert. But <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/oct/21/soft-drinks-industry-lobbies-government-dilute-scrap-sugar-tax\" title=\"\">excess sugar</a> is just as much an obesity risk as fat. The idea that childhood obesity is restricted only to pre-pubescent couch potatoes indulging their love of fried chicken is dangerous to our children\u2019s health and it should be challenged. If governments can\u2019t warn parents that their children are at risk, how are we supposed to do this?</p> <p>There are other areas where the state should be more muscular. Parents have the right to home-school their children. They are not obliged to register with a local authority or enter their child for any sort of qualification and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/sep/16/councils-seek-new-powers-to-check-on-home-schooled-children\" title=\"\">local authorities have very limited rights</a> to check up on families to ensure these children are getting an adequate education. No one monitors their progress.</p> <p>We don\u2019t even know how many there are: the number of children registered as being home-schooled has increased by 65% over the last six years to almost <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-35133119\" title=\"\">37,000</a>, but one 2009 government review suggested numbers could be as high as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2009/jun/11/home-education-parents-face-tighter-regulation\" title=\"\">80,000</a>.</p> <p>Some may be getting an adequate education \u2013 we just don\u2019t know. But it is clear that some parents are subjecting their children to ideological nonsense that they term \u201cnon-schooling\u201d or \u201cdelight-based learning\u201d, in which there is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/oct/11/unschool-children-monitor-home-schooling-education\" title=\"\">no curriculum, structured learning or testing; </a>instead, children are encouraged to \u201clearn through living\u201d. This is an outrageous state of affairs. We rightly argue that children worldwide have the right to attend school, so why not here? Home-schooling should be banned in all but the most exceptional of circumstances.</p> <p>Government should also be braver when it comes to vaccination. Immunity through vaccination is one of the greatest medical advances of the last two centuries: should parents really have the right to deny their children the health benefits, with knock-on impacts for other people\u2019s children? Yet in some parts of the country, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/sep/22/mmr-jab-under-twos-vaccination-falls\" title=\"\">MMR vaccination rates </a>remain too low to prevent breakouts of these diseases and the HPV vaccination remains controversial among many parents, despite the fact that it dramatically reduces the risk of girls developing cervical cancer. In many countries, including the US, Australia and Spain, it is compulsory for children to be vaccinated before they <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/8078500.stm\" title=\"\">start school.</a> Why not here?</p> <p>The Igbo proverb <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It_takes_a_village\" title=\"\">\u201cit takes a village to raise a child\u201d</a> contains a fundamental wisdom. Children are not mini-fiefdoms for individual parents to subject to their every whim, no matter how dearly they are loved.</p> <p>Of course, the idea of a state characterised by ideological, nosy do-gooders peering into every corner of family life is dreadful.

  "<h2><strong>Could the ruling lead to no Brexit?</strong><br></h2> <p>In itself no, because this is a ruling about how Brexit is achieved \u2013 the process \u2013 not the desirability or otherwise of it. The decision to leave has been taken and would require another referendum to reverse. What the judges decided was how the process of leaving had to be carried out. They determined that parliament should be the body that decides on matters to do with UK law, in this case the triggering of article 50, which sets the UK on a two-year path to exit and will mean EU laws no longer apply here. The government had argued this could be done by royal prerogative, effectively side-stepping parliament. The judges disagreed.</p> <p>There is no doubt, however, that the judgment gives the Remain side, which has a majority in the Commons and Lords, new opportunities to try to ensure Brexit is not too hard, that we remain tied into as many of the EU\u2019s projects \u2013 the single market, police cooperation, and research \u2013 as possible, while leaving full membership of the club. Longer term, some Remainers believe there is a chance that the public will turn against Brexit if and when people see that the rosy future they were promised outside the EU is not quite so easy to achieve after all. If the judgment means the dangers of leaving come more into the public mind, it is possible it could mark a turning point.</p> <h2><strong>What does the ruling mean the government now has to do?</strong></h2> <p>Theresa May made clear last week that she will appeal against the decision in the supreme court. The case will be heard next month, and a ruling made quite swiftly. If, as most people assume, that appeal fails, ministers will have to prepare legislation so that parliament can play the role the judges said it must, in setting in motion article 50.</p> <p>The nightmare for the prime minister, however, is that she will no longer be able to hide behind her stock, stalling phrases, \u201cBrexit means Brexit\u201d and \u201cwe won\u2019t give a running commentary\u201d \u2013 that have covered the fact that ministers are unclear how to proceed as they never expected the public to vote to leave.</p> <p>If May does not reveal quickly what kind of Brexit she wants (single market membership or not?), MPs will use the parliamentary process which the courts have insisted on to force decisions and clarity on her. They can seek to amend the bill which will have to be presented to them, to shape Brexit as they want to see it. A majority of MPs across all parties could then force her hand. If the Commons does not amend the bill, the House of Lords certainly will seek to do so.</p> <p>Ministers have to try to find a position on Brexit that will win the backing of MPs and peers. How they do it, no one knows.</p> <h2><strong>Will it be a free vote?</strong></h2> <p>This will be the subject of great debate in both the Tory and Labour parties. Cabinet ministers were allowed to campaign as they wished before the referendum vote so it is difficult to see how Conservative MPs can be forced to vote against their wishes at this stage, particularly if amendments are submitted on issues such as single market membership. The Tory manifesto committed the party to safeguard the UK\u2019s position in the single market, whether we left or stayed in the EU. So to force MPs to vote to leave it would not be popular with many. The danger of imposing a whip on MPs is that many will rebel. Informal cross-party alliances will be more important than the strictures of the whips.</p> <h2><strong>Does the ruling mean an early election?</strong></h2> <p>It makes it more likely because the ruling has undermined the government (it lost in the courts) and highlighted May\u2019s lack of a personal mandate and weakness in parliament. Her tiny Commons majority, shrunk further by the resignation of the Tory MP Stephen Phillips, leaves her in a perilous position in any contentious vote.</p> <p>As she has insisted she does not intend to go to the country before 2020, doing so would be seen as a sign of her being buffeted around by events. An election \u2013 while likely to deliver a larger Tory majority \u2013 would be no easy fix, however. It would highlight profound splits in the Conservative party in parliament and between its MPs and supporters in the country.</p> <p>Brexit would be put on hold for three months of national debate and squabbling and the economy could be harmed by more uncertainty. Labour would have to back an early election which most of its MPs would dread. It would be an election that nobody wanted. Rather than healing the divide over Brexit it could well deepen it.</p> <h2><strong>Could the row do lasting constitutional damage and further erode faith in the institutions that run the country?</strong></h2> <p> The irony behind the arguments over the judges\u2019 ruling is that Leave campaigners insist that \u2013 above all else \u2013 they want to \u201ctake back control\u201d from European institutions and vest it again in British ones. But now that the UK\u2019s own courts have made a ruling that complicates the passage towards a hard Brexit and argues for the very thing that Leave campaigners wanted most (parliament to be given back control) they complain that the judges\u2019 assessment is a betrayal of the people. The danger now is that it will not just be faith in politicians that is harmed, but faith in the UK legal system as well.</p> <p>The country\u2019s unwritten constitution operates a delicate set of checks and balances, determined through precedent, involving the Crown, parliament, the executive and the judiciary. The call by the Bar Council for justice secretary Liz Truss to condemn attacks on the judges was the opening salvo in what could become a toxic and hugely destabilising inter-institutional war between key components of the system. The Brexit debate has asked fundamental questions about where power lies in the UK. It was simpler when parliamentary democracy operated on well trodden paths. But on 23 June the people spoke and the system is uncertain as to how to deliver their will.</p> <p>Sensing that it could stir the Brexit-backing part of the population into a mass revolt against the judges, the <em>Daily Mail</em> labelled them \u201cenemies of the people\u201d on Friday and pointed out that one, Sir Terence Etherton, was \u201copenly gay\u201d.</p> <p>What began as a question about the EU\u2019s power has become a potentially very dangerous one about the power of the people and how far it can trump that of parliament and the courts.</p>",
  "<p>Medical and addiction experts, charities and parents are becoming increasingly concerned about the amount of time children are spending playing online games as figures show that UK spending on titles such as <em>League of Legends</em>, <em>World of Warcraft</em> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/grand-theft-auto\" title=\"\"><em>Grand Theft Auto </em></a>will top \u00a33bn this year.</p> <p>Dr Aric Sigman, a freelance lecturer in child health, said he had heard from a number of doctor\u2019s surgeries that parents were asking for sleeping pills for their children. \u201cWhether you call it an addiction or not, this is an enormous and growing problem,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The charity Action for Children says that a quarter of parents rank their children\u2019s screen time, and how to control it, as their greatest challenge \u2013 bigger than the traditional issues of homework or healthy eating.</p> <p>\u201cWe were surprised it came top. We hadn\u2019t picked up that it was such a big issue,\u201d says the charity\u2019s managing director, Carol Iddon. \u201cWith gaming, children get a lot of satisfaction and positive reinforcement, it can build their confidence. But that can make it become addictive.\u201d</p> <p>Ben Jones (not his real name) a gamer known by his online persona of Onibobo, is part of the growing sub-culture of young people, particularly male, who appear to have become hooked on internet gaming. \u201c<em>League of Legends</em> is my poison. I play it until pretty late,\u201d he said.</p> <p>His gaming sessions normally last about nine hours and typically run right through the night. Aged 27, he\u2019s been a heavy usage player since he was 15, and it has taken its toll. At college he spent more time gaming than studying, and since leaving he has found it tough to hold down a job. \u201cWhen I\u2019m playing I know every hour I could be doing something else with my life, but it gives you a weird sense of fulfilment, like you\u2019re achieving something,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Jones worries he is probably addicted \u2013 his gaming in part led to the break-up of a relationship this year \u2013 but he thinks he could stop if he really wanted to. \u201cIt\u2019s like smoking or drinking,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a very bad habit.\u201d</p> <p>The gaming industry is a reluctant to acknowledge any social responsibility, but brands are cashing in on growing demand. Data group Euromonitor calculates that UK spending on games will top \u00a33bn this year, 10 times more than households spend on traditional board games such as Monopoly or Scrabble.</p> <p>\u201cThe games are designed to keep you playing,\u201d said Peter Smith, a director at Broadway Lodge, an addiction treatment centre in Weston-super-Mare.</p> <p>Broadway has been helping people with drug and alcohol-related problems since 1974, and for the past three years has opened its doors to people struggling with gaming dependency. Smith says that parents have few places to turn to if they are worried about their children\u2019s gaming. There is no telephone helpline, and GPs and schools, while increasingly aware of the problem, have limited expertise in dealing with it.</p> <p>\u201cIf you\u2019re a parent with a 15-year-old who\u2019s playing endlessly, staying up late, not eating properly and then missing school because of it, where would you go for help? There isn\u2019t anywhere,\u201d &nbsp;he said.</p> <p>Most experts agree that the escapism and socialisation aspects of online gaming are a big part of the appeal. In <em>League of Legends</em>, for example, there is a clan system whereby players can invite others on to their list of friends, and then play as a group against other teams.</p> <p>But it is not necessarily a friendly environment. \u201cIf you\u2019re playing and make a mistake, you can have four people on your own team screaming at you, wishing you had cancer or your mother and father were dead,\u201d said Jones. \u201cPeople take it so seriously, they lose touch.\u201d</p> <p>Children losing touch with reality is the biggest concern for parents, perhaps. But gaming dependency \u2013 unlike gambling dependency, for example \u2013 is yet to be recognised with a formal diagnosis, and there is limited funding for research.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re under-aware of it, and we\u2019re therefore minimising what the potential problems are,\u201d said Smith.</p> <p>When pressed, Jones said he felt bad for his parents, who were concerned about the amount of time he spent in his room online. \u201cYou can lose a lot of cash, let alone time,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not really a transferable skill. It\u2019s a strange world to be in.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>We made history in Ukraine last week. For the first time ever, more than 100,000 top officials, including the president, members of the cabinet, MPs, judges, prosecutors and civil servants, declared their assets under our new e-declaration system. In a statement endorsed by all of Ukraine\u2019s leading civil society organisations, none of whom has been shy to criticise the authorities, they&#xa0;hailed the system as \u201ca truly revolutionary step towards eradicating corruption\u201d.</p> <p>Activists and journalists are already investigating the origins of cash and assets that have been declared by officials. This has shone a light on the highest levels of power and things will never be the same again. Achieving this was not easy and on our path to greater transparency we encountered many obstacles.</p> <p>The media, civil society and the public were sceptical until the last moment. The guardians of the old system were doing everything possible to prevent this and other changes that we have made to stamp out corruption.</p> <p>I well remember the difficulties that we had pushing this law through parliament, as I was the speaker of parliament at the time.</p> <p>Last summer, the e-declaration system was delayed and for a moment it looked as though it would fail, but the government stayed firm. I was one of the first top-level officials to declare his assets on the system. I will also be the first to say that I am ready for my declaration to be scrutinised. I believe that all Ukrainian public servants should have to explain the origin of their assets and, in cases where violations are uncovered, they should be punished under the law.</p> <p>The e-declaration system allows us to draw a line between politicians of the past, who have never explained the origins of their assets, and politicians of the future of Ukraine, who from now on will be accountable to the people and who must explain where they got their money.</p> <p>The new system is an important step in the process of stamping out corruption in Ukraine, but it is far from the final step. My cabinet will provide absolute support to the National Anti-Corruption Bureau, which our government created.</p> <p>As my declaration has shown, I am not the poorest man in Ukraine, though I am far from the richest. I entered politics in 2006 as a successful businessman, since which time I have declared my income. However, I am well aware that many people in my country still have very few economic opportunities and some live below the poverty line. The gap between rich and poor is a large part of what has made the declarations shocking for many Ukrainians.</p> <p>Improving this situation is my government\u2019s top priority. There is still much work to be done, but we are making real progress in implementing our reform agenda, with the ultimate goal of improving economic prospects for all Ukrainians.</p> <p>In addition to the reforms we have made to combat corruption, Ukraine has also taken steps to modernise our judiciary, transform the national police force and cut red tape to improve the environment for business and foreign investment.</p> <p>We have liberalised our energy markets, an important reform also intended to combat corruption and one that faced considerable opposition from vested interests. This year, the economy will grow by 1.5%, with 3% growth predicted for 2017. Inflation has fallen dramatically, from 43% in 2015 to 12% this year and 8% forecast for next year. The Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area between Ukraine and the European Union came into force on 1&#xa0;January, creating substantial economic benefits for both sides, and last summer we signed the Canada-Ukraine free trade agreement.</p> <p>As prime minister, my top priority is stabilising the country and growing the economy so that all Ukrainians can have the chance to succeed and improve their standard of living. To achieve this, we must lay down strong foundations on which we can build a modern European state. The e-declaration system is a milestone in this process.</p> <p>\u2022 Comments will be opened later</p>",
  "<p>Melania Trump appears to have spent the entire US election as a sort of anti-Michelle Obama \u2013 whatever she does, however hard she tries. Not that she\u2019s been that visible \u2013 her husband has mainly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/21/ivanka-trump-speech-republican-convention-women-gender-pay-mothers\" title=\"\">put his daughter, Ivanka,</a> in the first lady spot on his campaigning chain-gang. When Melania has been thrust into the spotlight, it\u2019s been to do a manifestly sub-par nerve-racked turn, before scurrying back into the shadows, amid <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/19/melania-trump-republican-convention-plagiarism-michelle-obama\" title=\"\">accusations (at the mildest) of speech-plagiarism.</a></p> <p>Now Melania has made another so-so speech (keeping to the relatively safe topic of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/03/melania-trump-cyberbullying-campaign-speech\" title=\"\">childhood bullying</a>). There have also been further allegations about Melania <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/05/melania-trump-was-paid-modeling-before-work-visa-records-show#img-1\" title=\"\">working as a model</a> before officially obtaining her US work visa. Does it matter? Of course it does (it makes a mockery of her husband\u2019s relentless anti-immigrant rhetoric). Another question could be: does Melania matter? After all this time, does she even exist as a legitimate separate entity outside of her husband\u2019s swirling toxic orbit?</p> <p>Throughout the Trump campaign, Melania has been simultaneously defined and eclipsed by her husband, which, considering his well-documented views on women, probably suits him just fine. With a man like Trump (an ego driven by a sonic blast of narcissistic personality disorder), it makes a weird kind of sense that his daughter (his issue, his blood) is given pole female position, validating his genetic grandiloquence (subtext: everything that is of Trump is magnificent!), while his third wife (with her \u201cchequered\u201d past) is given tasks and duties almost as an afterthought.</p> <p>Melania has been bounced down the Republican campaigning ranks from player to mere decorative human accessory, given as much significance and influence as Trump\u2019s choice of tie at a rally. At the same time, in every negative, dehumanising way possible, Melania has been completely defined by her husband. Of course, something similar also happened to Hillary Clinton \u2013 an actual candidate \u2013 who\u2019s spent her entire campaign being pelted by rocks for the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/27/wikileaks-bill-clinton-foundation-emails\" title=\"\">\u201csins of Bill\u201d.</a></p> <p>The difference is that Hillary has at least (small mercies) also been attacked for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/18/hillary-clinton-why-hate-unlikeable-us-election\" title=\"\">who she is</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/31/hillary-clinton-latest-emails-explained\" title=\"\">what she\u2019s done.</a> Then there\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/video/2016/sep/29/michelle-obama-we-need-an-adult-in-the-white-house-video\" title=\"\">Michelle Obama,</a> whose charisma seems at once amplified by her husband, while also robustly being independent of him. By contrast, from start to finish, the pressure has been on Melania to atone publicly for all her husband is and everything he represents, her every word and deed viewed and judged entirely via the omnipresent prism of the Donald.</p> <p>So what? you might ask. As the saying goes, if you lie down with dogs, you get up with fleas. But although associations are important, ultimately, only Donald Trump should be attacked for being Donald Trump.</p> <p>Certainly, it seems too easy and dangerous to assess women solely via the medium of their men. You can already see it happening with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/shortcuts/2016/nov/02/when-harry-met-meghan-markle-and-dragged-the-royals-into-the-21st-century\" title=\"\">Prince Harry and his new partner, Meghan Markel</a>, a successful, attractive biracial actress being systematically reduced to how she, her heritage and achievements fit in with The Almighty Him. As a feminist, it makes me feel uneasy watching Markel being defined via her \u201csuitability\u201d for Harry, as if this were her only pertinent characteristic, all other nuance and agency of a living, breathing, thirtysomething individual cheapened or obliterated.</p> <p>If this makes a soul uneasy, then perhaps the same courtesy should be extended to Melania Trump. Melania probably wouldn\u2019t make a great first lady. (Not so much the anti-Michelle, as simply inadequate). However, the fact remains that during a wild, dirty election, Hillary Clinton emerged hurt by Bill, but not felled by him, Michelle gloriously stepped out of Barack\u2019s shadow and even Ivanka is relatively unscathed. Only Melania wafts around like an election phantom whose only function is to be viewed and judged entirely via the medium of her husband. While it\u2019s not surprising that this happened, it\u2019s telling that nobody seems to mind a bit.</p> <h2>Salute Sting for relaunching the Bataclan</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"057f0fd5dccf794c5647963dcc624af1ac7fb29c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/057f0fd5dccf794c5647963dcc624af1ac7fb29c/0_134_4770_2862/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sting\u2019s appearance will be a boost for the Bataclan.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sting\u2019s appearance will be a boost for the Bataclan.<br></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tatan Syuflana/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Sting will be the first musician to perform at the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/20/bataclan-witnesses-recount-horror-paris-attacks\" title=\"\">Bataclan theatre</a> in Paris since the terrorist attacks last November that killed 130 people, 89 of them at the venue.</p> <p>A separate event has been planned, according to ed reports, to mark the anniversary of the attacks, attended by survivors and the band that performed on the night of the attack, the American group Eagles of Death Metal, whose roadie Nick Alexander died.

  "<p>One of the curiosities of the long rise of Ukip is that the party that wraps itself in the union flag, and invokes a cartoonish version of Britishness, seems to have such&#xa0;a limited understanding of Britain and its institutions.<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/nov/03/article-50-high-court-ruling-high-court-set-to-rule-on-whether-mps-should-vote-on-triggering-article-50-politics-live\" title=\"\"> A ruling last week</a> by three judges that parliament is sovereign and must scrutinise and authorise the triggering of article 50 to begin the process of the UK leaving the European Union should have been a cause for Eurosceptic celebration. The judges listened to legal arguments and, citing precedent, explained very clearly and carefully why parliament is sovereign in these matters and must pass an act to begin Brexit.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/nov/03/ruling-on-brexit-opens-way-to-mps-revolt\" title=\"\">Nigel Farage was furious</a> at this supposed incursion. He said that he had a \u201cfeeling\u201d (ah, one of his feelings) that \u201cbetrayal is near\u201d. Farage in full flow talks in almost mystical terms, as if he has some form of extrasensory perception that provides him with a unique insight into the course of national affairs and the tide of opinion. Having had such an enormous influence on shaping recent history, perhaps the trainee demagogue has started to fall for his own hype?</p> <p>The establishment, Farage said, is plotting to overturn the result of the referendum and betray the nation. There are certainly a few people trying \u2013 mistakenly and pointlessly \u2013 to reverse Brexit, but they are not running the government and do not have the numbers in the House of Commons or the country. Brexit will happen, as sensible pro-Remain MPs acknowledge. The question is in what form exactly.</p> <p>In that context, Farage\u2019s rabblerousing is deeply dangerous, because it creates the false impression that Britain will be blocked from leaving the EU, locked in by dastardly, dark forces.His betrayal narrative has echoes of November 1918 in Germany. Immediately after the country had lost the First World War fair and square, the nationalistic right said that the army had been betrayed by the wicked politicians of the establishment who had sued for peace. In that vein, it cannot be long before a leading figure from Ukip warns of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stab-in-the-back_myth\" title=\"\">\u201cthe stab in the back\u201d</a>, a phrase heavy with Germanic historical import from the same era.</p> <p>Farage\u2019s dangerous reaction demonstrates again that the party he built has more in common with continental populist parties and the wilder fringe movements on the right and left than it does with the British tradition of parliamentary democracy and respect for institutions. Farage is a Poujadiste, in the mould of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2003/aug/28/guardianobituaries1\" title=\"\">the infamous French politician</a> who channelled the anger of small-town France.</p> <p>But it is not just Ukip that has lost touch with the constitutional fundamentals. Other parts of the broad Brexit movement \u2013 some Tory MPs and the Eurosceptic press \u2013 have also reacted as if the article 50 decision constitutes a judicial coup against the Brexit vote. A full-blown constitutional crisis is underway, apparently, with parliament supposedly pitched against the people. Some of the more vocal Brexiters in the Tory parliamentary party have indulged this idea, illustrating what happens when campaigners become too hooked on runaway populism. Fresh from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/01/mark-carney-critics-let-him-do-his-job-brexit-virgin-money-jayne-anne-gadhia\" title=\"\">undermining the governor</a> of the Bank of England, they are now on to the judiciary. Is there any part of the British system, which theoretically they are dedicated to defending, they won\u2019t attack in lurid terms? Is even the Queen safe?</p> <p>Everyone needs to calm down. The anger against the judges would be justified if they had declared the EU referendum invalid and banned Brexit. They did no such thing. They simply confirmed that parliament should have its proper place in the Brexit process. Of course it should.</p> <p>It is not even as if the judges in this case have been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/nov/04/enemies-of-the-people-british-newspapers-react-judges-brexit-ruling\" title=\"\">particularly \u201cactivist\u201d</a>, which has been a problem in recent decades, with some judges pushing the interpretation of the law in a direction in tune with their thinking or trends in European law. Here \u2013 in the article 50 case \u2013 they took a thoroughly traditional and praiseworthy pro-parliament approach.</p> <p>For this, they were branded \u201cunelected\u201d, which is unintentionally revealing. The charge that judges being unelected equates to illegitimacy is yet more crazy populist talk. We do not elect judges and for good reason. Centuries of constitutional development and experimentation produced a system, compromised and weakened by EU membership, in which the judiciary is independent. Parliament makes the laws and the courts interpret the law and make judgments. Of course, we could try electing judges, or ordering judges to disregard and ignore the rule of law on the order of politicians, but the international historical precedents do not suggest it ever ends well.</p> <p>As someone who voted to leave the European Union, I simply cannot see the problem with the courts and parliament doing their respective jobs properly. Indeed, nothing could be more in tune with the vote to leave the European Union than three judges applying the law and declaring that parliament must give the go-ahead for article 50.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"68bbba02ad558069070559b5baac8cd805a2c61e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/68bbba02ad558069070559b5baac8cd805a2c61e/145_83_3105_1862/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nigel Farage said he had a \u201cfeeling\u201d that \u201cbetrayal is near\u201d.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nigel Farage said he had a \u201cfeeling\u201d that \u201cbetrayal is near\u201d.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Vincent Kessler/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But it is important to understand the limits of what the court decided and what parliament can reasonably do next. It is not a mandate to stop the UK leaving the EU. Those who think it is are the mirror image of the hardline Brexiters. Those equally hardline Remainers who refuse to accept that they lost the referendum and want it set aside mount attacks that are almost as frenzied as those of the Faragists.</p> <p>If the Remainiacs \u2013 and some are behaving like Jacobites \u2013 are not calling Leave voters stupid, they are the next moment branding them gullible, which is just a nicer way of saying stupid. But neither set of extremists is representative of, nor has a majority in, parliament or the country. What becomes ever more apparent over Brexit is that there is a need for an alliance between moderate (of which there are many) Leavers and moderate Remainers, those who regret the result on 23 June but accept it. If \u2013 <em>if</em> \u2013 a deal can be done after two years of talks with the EU, it will involve a degree of compromise, which again is supposed to be a British trait.</p> <p>If there is no bespoke British deal to be done, because the EU refuses, it will be hardish Brexit time. The chances of the former rather than the latter outcome being the result are greatly enhanced by moderate Leavers and Remainers co-operating. If you voted Remain and want to avoid a hard Brexit, organise for compromise.</p> <p>In terms of immediate next steps and article 50, the Commons wants assurances that the government has reasonable, achievable aims in its negotiations. There is not an appetite for blocking the process. The situation is more complicated in the House of Lords, but even there peers must know that an early election (achievable by the government voting itself out of office) would see Theresa May returned with a landslide majority for triggering article 50 and a mandate to get on with it.</p> <p>It may not come to that, although the government has not helped calm the situation by rushing to appeal to the supreme court. Theresa May would have done better by calmly accepting the outcome and saying that it illustrated the soundness of a British system that rests on the independence of the judiciary, government accountability to parliament and representative parliamentary democracy. That is what leaving the EU was at root supposed to be about, surely.</p>",

There is a lack of public awareness of this issue. Individual patients become aware of the drug that could help them. In my husband\u2019s case, that is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/oct/09/immunotherapy-drug-a-gamechanger-for-head-and-neck-cancer\" title=\"\">nivolumab</a>, which Nice has to date not approved for the treatment of advanced lung cancer despite its use elsewhere, including Scotland.</p> <p>Oncologists know immunotherapy and gene therapy are the future for cancer treatment. However, it seems to be the case that Nice, without either public debate about or awareness of the issue, is denying access through the NHS to a whole range of new drugs on costs grounds. That means this country will fall even further behind the rest of the first world in cancer survival rates than it already is. It also means access to what science can now offer to cancer patients is effectively already rationed, as only those like Steve Hewlett and my husband who can (just about) pay for the drugs, or those with health insurance, are able to receive treatment.</p> <p>There should be a full itemised statement from Nice of all such treatments that are not approved. I also believe that, in the face of the rapid advances in expensive treatments coupled with all the other pressures on the NHS, there needs to be a public debate on the question that politicians avoid: the need to look at alternative models of funding the NHS. Otherwise, we will end up with the current model offering increasingly developing world treatment to the majority, with only those who can afford them having access to modern effective drugs.<br><strong>Anne Braithwaite</strong><br>Leeds</p> <h2><strong>Proper support for industry</strong></h2> <p>You are right to highlight the importance of Britain\u2019s motor industry to our economic future (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/29/nissan-uk-car-industry-brexit-lifeline-gm-hit-the-road\" title=\"\">\u201cNissan throws UK a Brexit lifeline\u201d</a>, News) but you miss the key point: what matters most is our capacity to design world-beating products and dominate major markets.

  "<p>There is a scene in the BBC\u2019s adaptation of Zadie Smith\u2019s acclaimed novel <em>NW</em> in which a character listens as her old school friend holds court in her tastefully decorated north-west London home. The talk is of children and schools and house prices, and in that moment the gulf between the two is seemingly laid bare, one listening in disbelief at how far the other has travelled from the council estate they once called home.</p> <p>Yet behind that confident facade, the other woman is no less unsure about her place in the world, about the increasingly white and upper-middle-class world she moves in, about the part of London she still calls home that is inexorably changing day by day. It\u2019s both a painfully acute dissection of how the bonds of old friendship bind us and a sharp commentary on race, class and modern London life. It could only have been imagined by Smith.</p> <p>Ever since she burst on to the literary scene in 2000 at the age of only 24 with her first novel, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2000/jan/26/fiction.zadiesmith\"><em>White Teeth</em></a>, an exuberant coming-of-age tale set in the north-west London community of Willesden, Smith has carved out a reputation as modern London\u2019s finest chronicler. Her fourth novel, <em>NW</em>, a smart, spiky look at whether you can ever truly escape the past that defines you, cemented that reputation. Now this week sees the publication of her eagerly awaited fifth novel, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/nov/04/swing-time-by-zadie-smith-review\"><em>Swing Time</em></a>, a beautifully written, deeply melancholy meditation on fame and failure.</p> <p>All three books depict a world that\u2019s recognisably 21st-century London: diverse, vivid, at times cacophonous, stuffed full of dreams and aspirations, of fear and friction, where the houses of the wealthy abut the estates of the poor and tension simmers beneath the humour.</p> <p>\u201cLondon feels so real in her books \u2013 the characters feel like people I\u2019ve met and know or talked to or sat next to on the bus,\u201d says Nikesh Shukla, novelist and editor of much-praised essay collection, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/oct/02/the-good-immigrant-edited-nikesh-shukla-essays-race-colour-society-riz-ahmed-kieran-yates-selena-bim\"><em>The Good Immigrant</em></a>. \u201c<em>White Teeth</em> felt like the city I grew up in and <em>NW</em> and <em>Swing Time</em> feel like the city I live in now. They\u2019re very contemporary visions of London that don\u2019t ignore the city\u2019s tensions.\u201d</p> <p>They also depict a part of London too often ignored in favour of Soho\u2019s seedy glamour, the fine houses of Kensington, Mayfair and Hampstead, or the raffish charm of period Islington and Notting Hill. Smith\u2019s books sing of the suburbs that dot the north circular \u2013 Harlesden, Neasden, Wembley and, in particular, Willesden, that link between the inner city of Kilburn High Road and <a href=\"\">John Betjeman\u2019s Metro-Land</a>.</p> <p>Smith has described London as \u201ca state of mind\u201d and her work stands out for the ease with which she pins the capital city to the page. \u201cHer books present a working-class view of immigrants and ethnic identity,\u201d says Ben Judah, author of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jan/24/this-is-london-ben-judah-review-life-and-death-in-the-world-city\"><em>This Is London: Life and Death in the World City</em></a>. \u201cOther writers have written about London well, but they do so from an upper-middle and middle-class background. When I read <em>White Teeth</em> I was blown away \u2013 it was the first time I\u2019d read a book that spoke to the London I lived in.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bab13a5df622dffc37cea0c6800dd9dc53eef7a2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bab13a5df622dffc37cea0c6800dd9dc53eef7a2/0_196_4285_2570/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The adaptation of Smith\u2019s fourth novel \u2018NW\u2019 features Cyril Guel and Pheobe Fox.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The adaptation of Smith\u2019s fourth novel \u2018NW\u2019 features Cyril Guel and Pheobe Fox.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Steffan Hill/BBC/Mammoth Screen</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Shukla agrees. \u201cZadie\u2019s London is the London I grew up in. It\u2019s not just that I recognise the places, it\u2019s that she writes about a London that\u2019s both flawed and vibrant. She\u2019s writing about the city as a person of colour and nothing is at arm\u2019s length. Everything is real and visceral. You can touch and smell it.\u201d</p> <p>Where writers from Martin Amis to John Lanchester have covered the capital with a level of remove, as though circling the city from above to record its foibles, Smith writes from the bustling high streets of her youth, moving through the crowds purposefully like the native Londoner she is. \u201cIn <em>Swing Time</em> the city, the jobs I did, the pubs and places I know so well are all covered with deft accuracy,\u201d says author and poet Salena Godden, whose memoir <em>Springfield Road</em> covers similar territory. \u201cIt resonated because I enjoyed visiting the psycho-geography of this time in my life.\u201d</p> <p>On one hand there is little new in this. Since Charles Dickens, writers have sought to burrow down into London\u2019s core and expose the city\u2019s teeming soul. In the 30s and 40s, Patrick Hamilton, Norman Collins and Gerald Kersh eagerly strode down its hidden back streets. In the 50s and 60s, Colin MacInnes\u2019s London trilogy turned a journalist\u2019s eye on the dreamers and schemers of Notting Hill and North Kensington, Derek Raymond probed Soho\u2019s seamier edges and Sam Selvon wrote <em>The Lonely Londoners</em>, which remains probably the greatest exploration of London and the immigrant dream. In the 80s and early 90s, Alan Hollinghurst and Oscar Moore chronicled gay life in the capital, and Hanif Kureishi made his name with the 70s-set coming-of-age tale <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/oct/04/the-buddha-of-suburbia\"><em>The Buddha of Suburbia</em></a>. More recently, writers from Diran Adebayo, Courttia Newland and Patrick Neate to Linda Grant, Amanda Craig and Cathi Unsworth have adeptly captured the city\u2019s chaotic rhythms in books as diverse and fascinating as London itself.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>She\u2019s very good at illuminating the things we don\u2019t quite see and capturing a very, very mixed world</p> <footer> <cite>Rachel Bennette</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Yet Smith\u2019s novels stand apart for their ability to convince the reader that they\u2019re there, standing on those crowded streets alongside <em>White Teeth</em>\u2019s self-conscious Irie or <em>NW</em>\u2019s focused Natalie, or trudging into ballet class in a rundown church hall with <em>Swing Time</em>\u2019s unnamed narrator.</p> <p>\u201cEven though I live in south-east London, I can see my London in the London she writes about,\u201d says Rachel Bennette, who adapted <em>NW</em> for the BBC. \u201cThere\u2019s a very strong flavour of the city that comes through her work and makes it incredibly exciting and cinematic. She\u2019s very good at illuminating the things we don\u2019t quite see and capturing a very, very mixed world. <em>NW</em> is an amazing book about social exclusion that is itself highly inclusive. It\u2019s heavily populated and diverse and huge, like London itself.\u201d</p> <p>Interestingly, Smith\u2019s eye has become only more acute the further she has moved from the neighbourhood of her birth. \u201cShe is now a semi-outsider spending half her time living in the States and half in London,\u201d says Alex Clark, artistic director of the Bath Literature Festival. \u201cBut there\u2019s no element of tourism in her writing; instead she retains an enormous affinity with the place she grew up in.\u201d</p> <p>It helps, perhaps, that just as London is both the consummate insider\u2019s city and still a place where outsiders can flourish (just about), so Smith, now 41, is an elegant literary insider who retains an outsider\u2019s eye. She has talked before of having once had two voices \u2013 the voice of her childhood and the voice she assumed on going to Cambridge \u2013 and how she \u201cshould have kept both alive in my mouth\u201d.

  "<h2>Latin America<br></h2> <p>Governments have often preferred Republican presidential candidates because they historically put an emphasis on free trade, but this time, politicians and commentators are lining up to express doubts about Donald Trump, who has alarmed many with his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/16/donald-trump-mexico-presidential-speech-latino-hispanic\">dismissive comments about Latinos</a>, plans to build a wall on the Mexican border, and his unpredictable behaviour.</p> <p>Dem\u00e9trio Magnoli, a sociologist and prominent voice of Brazil\u2019s \u201cnew right\u201d, said a Trump victory would be a geopolitical earthquake. \u201cTrump is the closest the US has gotten to fascism. You would have an American president that is nationalist and nativist and we would see mass deportations, and a wall being built, which is likely since he will most likely not deport 11 million people.\u201d</p> <p>He predicted this would force Mexico to turn more towards Latin America and could upset free trade agreements and hurt economic growth.</p> <p>\u201cTrump is so unpredictable and politically inexperienced. We have no idea what he will do, but he seems authoritarian, sexist and contemptuous about Latinos,\u201d said Violeta Granera, of the opposition alliance in Nicaragua.</p> <p>By comparison, Hillary Clinton is seen as a safe pair of hands who is likely to continue the relatively benign policies of the Obama administration.</p> <p>Carlos Lins da Silva, a senior consultant for the S\u00e3o Paulo Research Foundation, said US regional policies were unlikely to see a major change, but added: \u201cThe election of Trump would \u2013 at least in the short term \u2013 cause dramatic impacts on the international system \u2026 if he puts into practice some of the programmes he is advocating. Brazil won\u2019t come away unscathed. For example, if he makes the entrance of Muslim people more difficult, builds a wall between Mexico and the US, has Nato members pay for US defence, encourages Japan to have a nuclear bomb, gets tougher on Nafta and other free trade deals. All of these ideas would have negative consequences for many countries.</p> <p>Diplomats said they did not expect a major shift in Washington\u2019s Latin American policy regardless of the outcome.</p> <p>\u201cHillary Clinton knows Brazil better than Trump, as she has been here before and knows people here, but there will not be any substantial change in relations either way because external relations with South America are a low priority for the US,\u201d said Rubens Barbosa, former Brazilian ambassador to Washington.</p> <p>The country with most at stake may be Cuba, which has enjoyed a reconciliation with the US under Barack Obama. Former Cuban president Fidel Castro weighed in with an article last month in the <em>Granma</em> newspaper in which he awarded Trump \u201cthe medal of mud\u201d, but the old revolutionary also had nothing good to say about the Democrats.</p> <h2>Middle East<br></h2> <p>Trump outraged the Arab world with his comments on Muslim immigration \u2013 and regional public opinion certainly reflects this. A survey of 3,017 people in the Middle East and North Africa found that \u2013 if they had a vote \u2013 half would snub both Trump and Clinton.</p> <p>On the fight against Islamic State, Clinton has pledged to never send troops back to Iraq, and ruled out boots on the ground in Syria. Trump has been less specific about his plan to fight Isis, but said in March that the US has \u201cno choice\u201d but to send 20,000 to 30,000 combat troops to the region.</p> <p>In the survey, from the Jeddah-based daily <em>Arab News</em> and pollsters YouGov, 46% said the US should send troops to fight Isis and collaborate closely with Russia on Syria. The rest did not want a US presence on the ground but did feel that Washington should be more involved in the humanitarian efforts for Syrian refugees, arm moderate groups and increase air strikes on Isis. Clinton was most popular, with 78% saying she would be the best for the Arab world.</p> <p>On the candidates\u2019 policies, Arab opinion is much more balanced. Clinton\u2019s stance on climate change and US Israel policy found strong support in the poll. But Arabs overwhelmingly back Trump\u2019s stance on abortion and, ironically perhaps, border controls.</p> <h2>Russia</h2> <p>Vladimir Putin <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/08/trump-putin-senate-republicans-marco-rubio-john-mccain\">was thrust into an unexpected starring role in this election,</a> and whatever the result, it will please the Kremlin that it has been able to cause so much mischief. How much of this was down to direct Kremlin meddling, we will perhaps never know, although the state media\u2019s bias towards Trump has been fairly clear.</p> <p>Most Russian analysts believe the US is systemically set up to oppose Russia, and while there is an understanding that Trump is an unusual candidate, many believe a Trump presidency would not change things much. Other more sober heads are well aware that for all Trump\u2019s friendly rhetoric, as president he would be a much more unpredictable quantity than Clinton, the devil they know.</p> <p>To go on the public rhetoric alone, the casual observer would think the Russian establishment is banking on Trump. Russian television has been giving airtime to many of Trump\u2019s claims that the election could be rigged, but this is as much to help discredit the US system in the eyes of viewers as it is sincere backing for Trump. He has been backed not because of his politics, but because he is the chaos candidate; in the same way Russia was also keen on Brexit. Even if Clinton wins, Russia knows that after this divisive campaign, US democracy is in for a period of soul-searching which will leave less energy and focus for meeting external threats.</p> <h2>Africa</h2> <p>If Africa has barely featured in the campaign, then the continent has, in part, returned the compliment. But though many experts believe the result may not imply any drastic change in US policies in Africa, there is still widespread anxiety and Trump has already alienated many, particularly with his apparently racist rhetoric.</p> <p>\u201cFew Africans are putting any store on Trump if he wins the election, that is if he remembers we exist once he\u2019s done with Mexicans and illegal immigrants,\u201d wrote Gitau Warigi, in Kenya\u2019s <em>Daily Nation</em>.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s call for a ban on Muslims entering the US received widespread coverage and provoked outrage. The Somalia-based Islamic militant group, al-Shabaab, included a clip of Trump proposing the temporary ban in one of its recruiting videos.</p> <p>The tycoon does have supporters. <a href=\"http://www.wingia.com/web/files/richeditor/filemanager/WINGIA_Global_Poll_on_US_Election_-_FINALIZED_Revised_Global_Press_Release.pdf\">Although a poll </a>in Nigeria found that 77% would vote Clinton and only 19% Trump, while in South Africa the proportion was 59% to 15%, some African commentators see Trump as an anti-establishment candidate of a sort they would welcome: one who could disrupt an unjust status quo.</p> <p>\u201cThe world and nations don\u2019t reform when they are comfortable. They only do so when they are afraid or have been severely injured \u2026 <a href=\"http://www.africareview.com/opinion/Bring-on-Donald-Trump-he-will-change-our-rotten-ways-/979188-3184656-rs3h5n/index.html\">bring on Trump</a>,\u201d wrote Charles Onyango-Obbo, a Kenyan publisher and columnist.</p> <p>However, neither candidate has given any real clues to their attitude on Africa. On trade, there is speculation that Trump\u2019s support for greater protection of US industries could mean higher tariffs that would <a href=\"http://www.nation.co.ke/news/world/Africa-unsure-how-a-post-Obama-regime-will-treat-Agoa/1068-3434786-x65cxy/index.html\">damage some African economies</a>, local analysts say. Nearly 40 countries in sub-Saharan Africa can export goods to the US duty-free under legislation from 2000. In some, the regime has served as a catalyst for industrial production.</p> <p>On aid, there are fears for the funding of projects to prevent and treat HIV and Aids which have helped millions. Clinton is seen as backing continued, or enhanced, public health assistance.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s allegations of vote rigging in the US have prompted strong reactions in a continent where manipulation of electoral process is widespread.</p> <p>\u201cDonald Trump is a gift to all tin-pot dictators on the African continent. He is giving currency and legitimacy to rigging because if it can exist in America, it can exist anywhere,\u201d Zimbabwean opposition leader Tendai Biti told Reuters news agency last week. However, it is a fake quote which has caused the biggest stir. Trump has been widely reported to have pledged to \u201clock up\u201d both Robert Mugabe, the veteran president of Zimbabwe, and Museveni. The false comment was not questioned and prompted anger, hope, ridicule, excitement and hilarity \u2013 as well as a small demonstration of support in Uganda where five protesters waved placards outside the US embassy.</p> <h2>Germany</h2> <p>A new video by German comedian Jan B\u00f6hmermann was released last week, entitled Grab US by the Pussy. It waxes lyrical about the foreign policy that Washington might pursue if Trump were in the White House.</p> <p>\u201cWe like the new spirit of your nation / Let\u2019s walk hand in hand into isolation\u201d goes one of the lines.</p> <p>In reality, the majority of Germans view the prospect of a Republican victory on Tuesday with fear. Some 65% of respondents in a YouGov survey released last week said that they were afraid of such an outcome. If Germans could vote, a poll by the magazine <em>Stern</em> found that only 5% would cast their vote for Trump.</p> <p>In political circles, Germany\u2019s biggest concerns relate to how much damage a Trump presidency would do to the transatlantic alliance. The US is the key contributor to the UN budget and has the highest military budget within Nato, yet during his campaign Trump has described Nato as \u201cobsolete\u201d and indicated that he would, at the very least, seek to renegotiate its framework.</p> <p>If the Republican wins and lives up to his own words, Germany and France would, after Brexit, be the two countries expected to try to fill the geopolitical vacuum in Europe. Hope remains that Trump\u2019s rhetoric would prove more dramatic than his actions.</p> <p>\u201cIn Berlin government circles,\u201d <em>Der Spiegel</em> recently wrote, \u201cofficials are more concerned about Trump\u2019s character than the radical political about-face he might introduce.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>A lot has happened since Nicholas Stern, then a permanent secretary at the Treasury, produced his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2006/oct/30/economy.uk\" title=\"\">landmark review</a> of the impact of climate change 10 years ago. His work was quickly recognised as the definitive account of the economic dangers posed to the planet by global warming.</p> <p>Since then, global temperatures have risen to record levels. Arctic summer sea ice has continued to shrink, as have many major land-based ice sheets. Carbon dioxide is being pumped into the atmosphere in ever-increasing amounts. At the same time, low-lying coastal areas, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/11/miami-drowning-climate-change-deniers-sea-levels-rising\" title=\"\">such as south Florida </a>and parts of Bangladesh, are experiencing more and more flooding as sea levels have risen. Scientists have begun to link extreme weather events to the planet\u2019s changing climate, while animal and plant species are gradualling moving towards the poles. So, a decade on, is Stern plunged in despair over our prospects? Not quite. While the picture is certainly grim, the world\u2019s top climate economist still believes there are grounds for modest optimism.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2006/oct/30/economy.uk\">Stern report: the key points</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cWe have been too slow in acting on climate change,\u201d he told the <em>Observer</em>. \u201cIn particular, we have delayed the curbing of greenhouse gas emissions for far too long. When we published our review, emissions were equivalent to the pumping of 40-41bn tonnes of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere a year. Today there are around 50bn tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent. At the same time, science is telling us that impacts of global warming \u2013 like ice sheet and glacier melting \u2013 are now happening much more quickly than we anticipated.\u201d</p> <p>In his report, published in October 2006, Stern warned that the cost of inaction would be far greater for future generations than the costs of actions taken today. \u201cWith hindsight, I now realise that I underestimated the risks. I should have been much stronger in what I said in the report about the costs of inaction. I underplayed the dangers.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/11/miami-drowning-climate-change-deniers-sea-levels-rising\">Miami, the great world city, is drowning while the powers that be look away</a> </p> </aside>  <p>These are stark remarks. Yet the dramatic success of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jun/02/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-paris-climate-summit-and-un-talks\" title=\"\">Paris climate talks</a> last year, and their subsequent rapid ratification by more than 90 countries, has provided the 70-year-old economist with a sense of hope: \u201cIt has taken only 11 months to get the Paris agreement ratified. It took eight years to get its predecessor, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/mar/11/kyoto-protocol\" title=\"\">Kyoto protocol</a>, into force. So in a sense, the last 12 months have been encouraging.\u201d</p> <p>In his review, Stern made a cogent case for the need to make drastic reductions in fossil fuel burning to curb emissions of carbon dioxide, which are heating our atmosphere dangerously. The costs involved \u2013 in investing in the development of alternative energy sources, for example \u2013 would be far outweighed by the costs of coping with an overheated world afflicted by flooding, soaring temperatures, ruined crops and farmland, lack of food and displaced people, he argued. Most experts responded positively to the review.</p> <p>Yet the world is still burning more and more fossil fuel and pumping more and more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. This has both long- and short-term consequences. \u201cApart from raising carbon levels and temperatures, burning fossil fuels causes air pollution, as we have learned over the past five years,\u201d says Stern. \u201cThe consequences are terrible. Air pollution kills more than 30,000 people a year in Britain. That is about one in 2,000 of the population. It has become one of the very big killers around the world. In China, it causes about 4,000 deaths a day.</p> <p>\u201cWe are killing millions every year from air pollution produced by burning fossil fuels. Yes, there are other sources of air pollution but burning fossil fuels is a large part of the story. That understanding is new and very important.\u201d</p> <p>As a counterbalance, Stern points to the fact that in recent years there has been an encouraging increase in the use of sustainable technologies that should help us to wean us of our fossil fuel dependency. Cities like Barcelona and Bogot\u00e1 have made themselves cleaner and healthier. Coal burning has peaked in China. Hybrid cars and electric vehicles are being sold in increasing numbers and the cost of making solar panels has been reduced by a factor of 20. \u201cWe have reached the point where we can now see that the alternative route is not really something that should be regarded as a cost. It is actually a much better way of doing things, even if you had never heard of climate change,\u201d says Stern.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"30bd22c4c7167d0e62590bf46332af0d6b3eda51\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/30bd22c4c7167d0e62590bf46332af0d6b3eda51/81_0_1263_758/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Heathrow\u2019s third runway could be incompatible with the Paris climate targets\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Heathrow\u2019s third runway could be incompatible with the Paris climate targets, says Stern.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But the message has taken too long to sink in, and as result we are approaching a crunch point, he argues. In the next 20 years, as economies across the globe expand, the planet is likely to build infrastructure \u2013 roads, buildings, ports and airports \u2013 that will more than double what already exists.</p> <p>The crucial issue is the nature of that infrastructure. \u201cIf it is dirty and high carbon, it will lock us into that technology for a long time. We will be sentenced to live in cities where we cannot breath or move or be productive. If we do it using sustainable technology, however, we could have an extremely attractive future where you have strong growth, poverty is reduced, cities are cleaner and forests are saved. People have not sufficiently understood the importance of the next 20 years. They are going to be the most decisive two decades in human history.\u201d</p> <p>Last year\u2019s Paris climate deal suggests there is a will to avoid the worst and there is a prospect of further strong agreements being reached at this month\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/nov/02/indigenous-rights-forests-climate-change-study\" title=\"\">talks in Marrakech</a>. India, China and the US have all made positive noises. Hillary Clinton is a firm supporter of climate change initiatives \u2013 but what if Donald Trump is elected president? This is a man who has claimed the concept of global warming was created \u201cby and for the Chinese in order to make US manufacturing noncompetitive\u201d and who has pledged to tear up the Paris agreement. Stern\u2019s response is diplomatic: \u201cIt would make things very much more difficult,\u201d he says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4449f4300daebd53d35c82d6cdf10fea8f195771\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4449f4300daebd53d35c82d6cdf10fea8f195771/0_241_3404_2043/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Plane takes off\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The UK could still cut its carbon emissions from aircraft by 80% by 2050 \u2013 if there is a major improvement in aviation technology.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Steve Parsons/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Closer to home, Stern says he is confident the government understands the importance of adhering to its commitments to reduce UK carbon emissions by at least 80% by 2050 \u2013 despite the \u201cpolicy wobbles\u201d of the previous administration. David Cameron pledged his would be the greenest government ever but ended up cutting support for solar panels on homes, killing the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/green-deal\" title=\"\">Green Deal</a> to help people insulate old homes, scrapping green building standards for new homes and cutting support for industrial solar projects. \u201cTo behave in an unpredictable way, as the government did last year, is to be really damaging to investment,\u201d says Stern. \u201cThat is why it was worrying. But I am hopeful, though I cannot be sure, that the new administration will take a more balanced and predictable approach. It should certainly be at the core of the new government\u2019s industrial strategy and I will be looking for hints of that in the chancellor\u2019s autumn statement.\u201d</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/25/heathrow-third-runway-davies-commission\" title=\"\">proposed new runway for Heathrow</a> is a more complex issue, however. Analysis suggests the country could just about deal with the extra emissions produced by the additional planes, and still cut its carbon emissions by 80% by 2050 \u2013 if there is a major improvement in aviation technology. This would involve developing more efficient engines, better biofuels and lighter planes. \u201cHowever, that commitment to reduce emissions by 80% was made in order to hold global temperature rises to 2C. The Paris climate deal suggested we should be more ambitious and go for a 1.5C limit. That means that if the UK\u2019s targets are altered \u2013 as I believe they should be \u2013 to reflect the Paris agreement, there is now a question about whether we can have that extra runway and the extra carbon emissions it will generate. We need to check again if it is manageable,\u201d adds Stern.</p> <p>The Paris agreement remains central to Stern\u2019s sense of cautious optimism. \u201cIt was the honesty of the delegates\u2019 awareness of the nature of the problem and the speed of the agreement\u2019s ratification that has given me most hope. We have a lot to do to limit carbon emissions to an effective level. I am confident that it is possible to achieve that, though I cannot say that I am confident it will happen.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>As the markets tremble, the polls tighten, the bookies scramble to adjust the odds, and the US presidential race enters its final, frantic days, the rhetoric \u2013 from the president down \u2013 grows more hysterical by the hour.

It too was held on 8 November.</p> <p>Trump may have plumbed the depths of vulgarity, sleaze and pig-ignorance, but he is anticipated by the politics of the 1850s, in the decade before Abraham Lincoln\u2019s presidency. Not many now remember <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/aug/18/donald-trump-immigration-know-nothing-dangerous-republicans\" title=\"\">Millard Fillmore</a> or his supporters, the self-styled \u201cKnow Nothings\u201d, but these wild patriots, the forefathers of the angry white males who chant \u201clock her up\u201d, prefigure many aspects of the Trump campaign, promising to \u201cpurify\u201d American politics.</p> <p>The Know Nothings exploited popular fears that the country was being overwhelmed by immigrants, who were seen as enemies of the republic and, more sinister still, controlled by the pope.

Burr, who was Thomas Jefferson\u2019s vice-president at the time, mortally wounded Alexander Hamilton, and charged with murder had to flee to safety in the south.</p> <p>Rhetorically, the mudslinging inspired by Jefferson\u2019s two successful campaigns for the presidency was often as ugly as anything heard on the stump with Trump and \u201ccrooked Hillary\u201d. In the 1800 presidential election, Jefferson fought John Adams, whose supporters charged that Jefferson was a godless libertine in thrall to the French. This election was said to have been \u201cone of the most acrimonious in the annals of American history\u201d.</p> <p>More than 200 years later, many commentators believe that the US system is broken. But it has seemed broken before and somehow staggers on. From some points of view, the ferocity of Trump v Clinton is evidence of vigour not breakdown. However, some observers are wondering if the shock that would reform the system might destroy it.</p>",
  "<p>It has become painfully clear since June\u2019s vote to leave the European Union that Theresa May\u2019s government and its supporters have little or no idea where the country is heading. Lacking a plan or a shared philosophy, they are united by an arbitrary and destructive rush to the exit. Their hysterical reaction to last week\u2019s unanimous high court ruling that Britain cannot quit the EU without parliament\u2019s consent also reveals extraordinary ignorance about where we, as a country, have come from. It is dismaying that those who campaigned so passionately to reclaim British sovereignty appear not to have the first idea about their country\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/nov/03/ruling-on-brexit-opens-way-to-mps-revolt\" title=\"\">long-established constitutional arrangements</a>.</p> <p>It is a fundamental principle of British democracy that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/11/we-voted-brexit-keep-parliament-sovereign-wont-be-gagged\" title=\"\">parliament is sovereign</a>. Not the government. Not the executive or a self-selecting clique within it. Certainly not this prime minister, who lacks a personal mandate. Sovereign power resides with our elected, representative parliament. This state of affairs did not come about by chance. A power struggle between the crown and its subjects raged almost unceasingly in the centuries following <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jan/02/magna-carta-800th-anniversary-relevance-david-carpenter\" title=\"\">Magna Carta</a>. The proposition that the monarch cannot rule without parliament\u2019s consent lay at the heart of England\u2019s serial 17th-century civil wars. The question was settled by the parliamentarians\u2019 victory at the battle of Worcester in 1651. Parliament\u2019s ascendancy was legally established in the Glorious Revolution of 1688, which spawned the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/civil_war_revolution/glorious_revolution_01.shtml\" title=\"\">landmark Bill of Rights</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"56dbbd362bff8a1f5bb814465fa4fda69312df70\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/56dbbd362bff8a1f5bb814465fa4fda69312df70/0_0_4810_3433/1000.jpg\" alt=\"George Jeffreys, the infamous lord chief justice of England is caught and beaten by a London mob during the Glorious Revolution, December 1688.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"714\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">George Jeffreys, the infamous lord chief justice of England is caught and beaten by a London mob during the Glorious Revolution, December 1688.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Edward Gooch/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It is also a long-established fact of British constitutional life that the country\u2019s senior judges do not make domestic law. Their independent role is to interpret laws agreed by parliament, say what they mean and how and if they may be legally implemented. When Britain joined what was then the EEC, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/02/theresa-may-great-repeal-bill-eu-british-law\" title=\"\">European Communities Act</a>, passed by parliament in 1972, incorporated many European laws into domestic law. Thus it is both illogical and ignorant to castigate the high court for doing its job and stating the constitutionally obvious: that having passed the act, only parliament can override it by consenting <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/25/article-50-brexit-debate-britain-eu\" title=\"\">to activate article 50 of the Lisbon treaty</a>.</p> <p>Yet castigating the judges and by extension, anybody who has the effrontery to agree with them, is exactly what the hard Tory Brexiters and their accomplices in the lie factories of Fleet Street have resorted to with a venom, vindictiveness and vituperation remarkable even by their standards. The will of the people has been thwarted by an \u201cactivist\u201d judiciary. These bewigged, closet Remainers, members of the fabled \u201cwell-heeled liberal metropolitan elite\u201d, are \u201cenemies of the people\u201d, they shriek. Some of these sleaze-peddlers even dipped into homophobia, <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3903436/Enemies-people-Fury-touch-judges-defied-17-4m-Brexit-voters-trigger-constitutional-crisis.html\" title=\"\">highlighting the sexual orientation of one of the judges.

It wilfully misunderstands the relationship between parliament, government and the judiciary. Partisanship is understandable, but this level of stupidity is unforgivable. It misleads and distorts \u2013 either deliberately or out of ignorance. As Hilary Benn pointed out yesterday, the high court judgment has nothing to do with defying the \u201cwill of the people\u201d. As he explained, \u201cthe judgment is not to do with the fact that we will be leaving the European Union. It was a ruling on who starts the process, who fires the starting gun and in upholding the principle of parliamentary sovereignty\u2026 the judges said that since it was legislation that took us in, it should be parliament that takes the decision to start that process and not the government.\u201d</p> <p>Or here is Conservative MP and ex-attorney general Dominic Grieve speaking on <em>Newsnight </em>on Friday: \u201cI was horrified at the newspaper coverage, which reminded me of Robert Mugabe\u2019s Zimbabwe. The judges did exactly what was asked of them \u2013 they highlighted that our constitution does not allow you to overturn statute law by decree.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/nov/03/ruling-on-brexit-opens-way-to-mps-revolt\">Article 50 ruling leaves Theresa May facing potential MP revolt</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The judiciary are at the heart of our commitment to the rule of law and those who question their legitimacy (because they disagree with their view) threaten to undermine a critical institution vital to our democracy. Yesterday, the Bar Council took the extraordinary step of asking the lord chancellor, Liz Truss, to condemn the \u201cserious and unjustified\u201d attacks on senior judges over the Brexit court ruling. Senior judges having to appeal to the lord chancellor to defend them from unjustified attacks, in Britain, in 2016?</p> <p>Since 23 June, the country has loosed itself from tolerant, civil discourse - on both sides. The world has often looked to Britain as an example of a pluralist, inclusive democracy and a cultured, ordered and civil society. But that is changing. As the world looked at the response of politicians and the popular press to last week\u2019s court judgment, many will have concluded that it had more in common with Sisi\u2019s Egypt or Erdo\u011fan\u2019s Turkey than the Britain they thought they knew. A&#xa0;country that hounds, demonises and implicitly threatens its independent judiciary is one that toys menacingly with the very tenets of democracy.</p> <p>We noted in these columns some weeks ago that Theresa May, who coined the phrase the \u201cnasty party\u201d to describe the Conservatives some years ago, was threatening to turn Britain into the nasty country. That is increasingly the message being sent across the world. It is also the message being sent to foreigners living here, including long-resident EU nationals now afraid to speak openly for fear of rebuke or worse.</p> <p>Many more reasonable Brexit supporters have rightly distanced themselves from campaign to demonise the judges responsible for last week\u2019s ruling. But the government\u2019s ill-advised decision to appeal to the supreme court means judges sitting on England\u2019s highest bench, who will consider the matter next month, may now also be subject to overt political pressure and similarly contemptuous, intimidatory invective. In Turkey or Burundi, such tactics by the state and its surrogates <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/nov/04/labour-condemns-newspaper-attacks-on-judges-after-brexit-ruling\" title=\"\">might not be considered surprising</a>. But here?</p> <p>What sort of country is Britain becoming that this sort of menacing behaviour is not only tolerated but implicitly encouraged by senior government ministers who fear, correctly, they are losing the argument? As has been repeated ad nauseam, the issue is not about reversing or somehow sabotaging the referendum result. It is about ensuring proper democratic scrutiny of the government\u2019s negotiating positions, about ascertaining whether its approach advances the national interest rather than sectional, business and City interests. It is about getting the best deal for Britain.</p> <p>The concerted assault on the judiciary comes in the context of wider institutional vandalism indulged by the hard Tory Brexiters and their international sympathisers and emulators. They would recklessly tear up nearly 45 years of carefully navigated British relationships with our European neighbours. The resulting damage to the economy and living standards is mounting fast.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"947bbe3f971f2bd3c44479d312582db829155d59\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/947bbe3f971f2bd3c44479d312582db829155d59/0_0_4919_3264/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gina Miller, the businesswoman at the centre of the high court case, speaks after the judgment on Thursday.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"664\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gina Miller, the businesswoman at the centre of the high court case, speaks after the judgment on Thursday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Johnny Armstead/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Much worse is to come. In America, Donald Trump runs a presidential campaign based on fear, prejudice, ignorance and xenophobia, which he claims represents change, not abject regression, and threatens to reject the election outcome if it goes against him. The dire cost of Trumpism to America\u2019s national unity and cohesion is already plain.</p> <p>Across Europe, iconoclastic extremist and nationalist parties compete to demonstrate who is most intolerant, most hateful and best at scaring people. In France, their vile message may be working as presidential elections approach and the Front National gains ground. But hard Tory Brexiters do not see the link, deny any crossover, cannot understand how their institutional dumpster fire stokes nihilism and chauvinism. They dwell in their Little England bubble, detached from the real world or, as the high court said of their article 50 arguments, \u201cdivorced from reality\u201d. Anybody who disturbs their narrative, such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/nov/04/stephen-phillips-resigns-over-undemocratic-brexit-process\" title=\"\">Stephen Phillips, who resigned as a Conservative MP on Friday</a>, is shunned as a blood foe. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/nov/01/legally-protected-uk-food-products-brexit-threat-nick-clegg\" title=\"\">Nick Clegg</a>, for daring to add his voice to the democratic debate over Brexit, is ridiculed. Will these people who hound reasonable public figures ever understand what a mature democracy involves? Formidable, robust, intelligent and reasoned debate.</p> <p>As <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/nov/04/theresa-may-told-to-act-to-calm-brexit-mob-anger\" title=\"\">Dominic Grieve</a> said: \u201cDebate helps outcomes, suppressing it destroys it.\u201d Would they rather our public discourse \u2013 and hence, public life \u2013 be characterised by childish slurs, homophobia, distortions and vicious rhetoric? That is where Britain is being driven by a new hard Brexit elite.</p> <p>It behoves any sensible, reasonable public figure to recognise that a 52-48 referendum result is one where national cohesiveness matters. And while it delivered a mandate to exit the European Union, it did not give sweeping powers to brush aside challenges on the nature, timing and texture of that exit. There is a lack of reason on both sides of this debate and there is a danger that the public fissures that have opened up since June 23rd become wider still. We all have a responsibility to ensure that does not happen. As Iain Martin says elsewhere on these pages, \u201cNeither set of extremists is representative of, nor has a majority in, parliament or the country. What becomes ever more apparent over Brexit is that there is a need for an alliance between moderate (of which there are many) Leavers and moderate Remainers, those who regret the result on 23 June but accept it.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ce9dde605695bbc948a496efe99c9e03952ec483\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ce9dde605695bbc948a496efe99c9e03952ec483/0_93_2944_1767/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The prime minister, Theresa May\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The prime minister, Theresa May: \u2018She has already shown a talent for wrong-headedness, an unerring instinct for the bad call.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kirsty Wigglesworth/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The truth is, hard Tory Brexiters are fearful of losing the argument. The truth is there is little confidence that May can keep her head and rein in the irresponsible fantasies of her more wild-eyed colleagues. The truth is, May has already shown a talent for wrong-headedness, an instinct for the bad call, as seen with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/15/hinkley-point-c-nuclear-power-station-gets-go-ahead\" title=\"\">Hinkley Point</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/sep/09/theresa-may-to-end-ban-on-new-grammar-schools\" title=\"\">grammar schools</a>, child obesity and Nissan subsidies. She appears unable to grasp the EU\u2019s blunt insistence that access to the single market cannot be divorced from freedom of movement.</p> <p>The disdain, scepticism and bewilderment of Britain\u2019s EU partners is wounding. At last month\u2019s Brussels summit, her first, May was kept waiting until the early morning before being allowed to deliver a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/21/theresa-may-awkward-eu-meeting-sees-little-progress-on-brexit\" title=\"\">short statement on Brexit</a>. She was listened to in silence. Nobody deigned to respond. On Friday, her calls to Germany\u2019s Angela Merkel and the commission president, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/13/jean-claude-juncker-eu-is-facing-existential-crisis\" title=\"\">Jean-Claude Juncker</a>, when she tried to persuade them, implausibly, that her March deadline for article 50 still stood, were embarrassingly brief. Few in Europe now believe Britain\u2019s government has a roadmap.</p> <p>In such circumstances, it is imperative that parliament, now given its chance \u2013 and reminded of its duty \u2013 to shape Britain\u2019s future course by the high court, steps up to the mark. For too long, too many MPs who support continued EU membership (a majority overall) have been cowering in silence, fearful that any expression of unease over the Brexit process will be misrepresented as a bid to overturn the referendum result. No one disputes the result of the referendum, or the social, cultural and political tensions that delivered it, but it is right that the manner of our exit are properly scrutinised. That has yet to be decided. And parliament, rightly, has a role to play.</p> <p>To be worthy of its sovereign status, both Houses of Parliament should now inject themselves into the Brexit process. This means cross-examining ministers and demanding a green paper on the government\u2019s plans. It means proposing alternative strategies. It means amending and, if need be, discarding wrong-headed approaches. And it means the holding of binding votes not only on when article 50 should be triggered but also on the final terms of any eventual exit agreement.</p> <p>In short, parliament must be ready to exercise veto power over any Brexit deal that does not ultimately serve the national interest \u2013 because this government simply cannot be trusted not to deliver serious economic self-harm on the altar of blind ideology. It is a tall order. The growing prospect of an early general election, should May continue to trip, fumble and flop, presents many MPs with an existential dilemma: whether to vote with their conscience and uphold the democratic rights of parliament and their constituents or be pushed and pulled along by a populist tide, propelled by lies. Most Labour MPs, for example, represent constituencies where a majority voted Leave. It is still likely that last week\u2019s ruling proves a pyrrhic victory, by provoking an early election that, with the current dire state of the Labour party, will give May an enhanced majority. Thus, we will have a parliament with fewer teeth and providing less scrutiny or push-back than is required.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/nov/03/nicola-sturgeon-scotland-mps-joining-article-50-legal-battle-brexit-high-court\">Nicola Sturgeon deciding whether to join article 50 legal battle</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Perhaps prodded by the shadow Brexit minister, Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, could be stirred from his lethargic ambivalence over Europe.
