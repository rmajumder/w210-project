  "<p>The man likely to be the Britain\u2019s last European commissioner has vowed he will act in the EU\u2019s interest, rather than be London\u2019s voice in Brussels.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/25/uk-european-commissioner-jonathan-hill-quits-brexit\">UK's European commissioner quits in wake of Brexit vote</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Sir Julian King, nominee to become Britain\u2019s next and probably final European commissioner, said he would act in the common interest if confirmed in the post. \u201cI know the high levels of integrity and impartiality as well as European commitment that you will rightly expect of me,\u201d he told MEPs at a hearing designed to test his suitability for the job. \u201cI am genuinely not here to speak for Her Majesty\u2019s government.\u201d</p> <p>European commissioners are meant to act in the EU\u2019s interest rather than represent their countries. But as a career diplomat, who is likely to face greater scrutiny because of Brexit, King is expected to strive even more for impartiality than a politician commissioner might.</p> <p>King will play no formal role in Brexit negotiations. Instead he has been offered the portfolio of \u201csecurity union\u201d but had to convince MEPs of his suitability for the role during a three-hour hearing in Strasbourg on Monday night. The European parliament, which votes on his appointment on Thursday, does not have a veto but it would be difficult for King to take up the job without MEPs\u2019 support.</p> <p>Security has shot up the EU\u2019s agenda since terrorist attacks in Paris, Brussels and Nice, with recriminations about repeated national failures to share information, allowing terrorists to slip through the net.<br></p> <p>The EU\u2019s executive has vowed to create a security union \u2013 a host of measures to deepen co-operation on counter-terrorism \u2013 as a complement to economic union.<br></p> <p>Efforts to develop a common defence policy are also picking up speed, as it emerged that France and Germany are intensifying efforts for great military co-operation. According to a policy paper seen by Reuters, the EU\u2019s two largest founding members want to create a permanent joint EU command headquarters for civilian and military EU missions, although the plans fall short of an EU army.<br></p> <p>Security and common defence are expected to be themes advanced by the European commission\u2019s president, Jean-Claude Juncker, in his annual \u201cstate of the union\u201d speech on Wednesday. EU leaders are also likely to touch on these subjects on Friday when they meet for a summit without the UK.<br></p> <p>The decision to offer King a security portfolio is seen as a shrewd move. King stressed the UK would need to continue to work with the EU, regardless of Brexit. \u201cJihadi terrorists don\u2019t make any distinction between Brussels, Paris and London and don\u2019t make any distinction [on the basis of] the relationship a country has with the European Union.\u201d</p> <p>A former director-general of the Northern Ireland office, King referred several times to his experience countering radicalism in the aftermath of the troubles. He stressed repeatedly that \u201cthe most successful counter-radicalisation work is not done by the state, it is done by civil society actors\u201d.</p> <p>Currently serving as ambassador to France, King opened the hearing by making the first half of his speech in French, although he mostly spoke in English. Unsurprisingly for a top British civil servant, he said he had supported the government\u2019s remain position. But the EU had to respect the leave vote, he said, adding that he would not be \u201cgiving a running commentary\u201d on negotiations. </p> <p>The vacancy arose after Lord Jonathan Hill <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/25/uk-european-commissioner-jonathan-hill-quits-brexit\">quit his position as EU financial services chief following the Brexit vote</a>. David Cameron appointed King in one of his final acts as prime minister, as the UK is entitled to have a commissioner at the table in Brussels for as long as it remains an EU member.<br></p> <p>Several MEPs previously questioned whether the British commissioner should get any portfolio. But some may be assuaged by the fact that King would arrive at the commission, already steeped in the workings of the EU.<br></p> <p>Whereas his predecessor was an ex Conservative minister, King is a seasoned diplomat who knows Brussels well. He has served as chief of staff to two former British commissioners, Peter Mandelson and Catherine Ashton. Between 2004-08 he was the UK\u2019s representative on the EU\u2019s political and security committee. He is married to Lotte Knudsen, a high-flying civil servant in the EU\u2019s diplomatic service.</p> <p>In a sure-footed performance, the diplomat dismissed suggestions that his appointment signalled an attempt by Britain to depoliticise the commission or downgrade the job. \u201cI am not a politician but I have spent the past 25 years swimming in a political sea,\u201d he said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t look to me like a dossier that is part time or second class.\u201d</p> <p>The tone of the meeting was polite, ranging over numerous technical policies, from EU data retention to wildlife trafficking.</p> <p>But the hearing showed that King could be caught in the crossfire of delicate questions. If confirmed as a European commissioner, he would become an architect of an EU entry-exit system that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/09/britons-may-have-to-apply-to-visit-europe-under-eu-visa-scheme\">could result in Britons paying to visit the continent</a>. The British diplomat also made clear he saw \u201ca problem\u201d if the British government failed to opt into Europol, the EU policy agency. The UK will be excluded from Europol\u2019s crime-fighting work unless it adopts a new law by May 2017, posing an awkward political problem for Theresa May\u2019s Brexit government. King said he would do everything in his power, without fear or favour to ensure EU member states engage with Europol.</p> <p>Claude Moraes, the British Labour MEP who chairs the civil liberties committee, praised this answer for showing \u201cstrong political judgment\u201d, arguing that a lesser candidate would have dodged the question. \u201cI was very impressed, he showed a deep-seated understanding\u201d of the dossier, the MEP said after the hearing.</p> <p>The strongest criticism came from British eurosceptics sitting in the Ukip-led and far-right group, who questioned King\u2019s commitment to Brexit. \u201cYou work for the 65m [British citizens] said Janice Atkinson, the former U kip MEP <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/16/ex-ukip-janice-atkinson-joins-le-pen-led-eu-group\">who sits with Marine Le Pen\u2019s far-right group</a>. \u201cYou don\u2019t owe any allegiance to this place.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>A black man who was shot dead by police officers called to a domestic altercation at his Florida home was \u201cexecuted\u201d as he sat eating chicken wings in his backyard, relatives claimed on Monday.</p> <p>Deputies from Broward sheriff\u2019s office shot Gregory Frazier, 55, multiple times outside the house in Pompano Beach on Friday night after a 911 call from his sister, who said he was threatening her and her daughter with a knife and \u201cbreaking up the house\u201d after a day of drinking.</p> <p>In the call, Deborah Frazier warned the dispatcher that her brother was wielding a Swiss army-style pocket knife.</p> <p>But Frazier\u2019s relatives insist he had regained his composure by the time the two officers arrived and was sitting calmly in the backyard eating chicken and fries when they approached him. </p> <p>Quartaze Woodard, Frazier\u2019s nephew, <a href=\"http://www.browardpalmbeach.com/news/bso-deputies-fatally-shoot-pompano-beach-man-who-was-eating-chicken-wings-updated-8072862\">told the Broward New Times</a> that the officers opened fire after his uncle twice refused an order to lie on the ground. </p> <p>Woodard said that the officers handcuffed Frazier after shooting him, then released the handcuffs and attempted to perform CPR once they realized he was unresponsive. </p> <p>Deborah Frazier, meanwhile, told the New Times that she regretted calling 911. \u201cI would never have called the cops if I\u2019d known this would happen. They just came in and started shooting right away,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Scott Israel, the Broward County sheriff, announced on Monday that he had asked the Florida Department of Law Enforcement to investigate Frazier\u2019s death, along with another deputy-involved shooting in Pompano Beach earlier in the day that saw a motorist and traffic officer taken to hospital.</p> <p>In that incident, Israel said, a \u201croutine traffic stop\u201d turned violent when a driver reversed his car into a deputy and another officer fired his weapon at the motorist, striking him in the shoulder. Neither injury was life threatening. Israel said he planned to attend Monday night\u2019s community gathering to speak about both incidents.</p> <p>Earlier on Monday, Frazier\u2019s family had released a statement through the law firm of civil rights attorneys Daryl Parks and Benjamin Crump demanding answers.</p> <p>\u201cWe are working diligently with our legal team to determine exactly why police felt the need to execute him as he ate his supper in the backyard of his house rather than use negotiation tactics,\u201d the statement said.</p> <p>\u201cWe will never forget Greg and we will fight so that his death will not be covered up.\u201d</p> <p>Crump, an attorney who rose to prominence when he represented the family of Trayvon Martin, the unarmed black teenager shot dead by neighbourhood watch leader George Zimmerman in Sanford, Florida, in 2012, echoed the relatives\u2019 calls for information.</p> <p>\u201cThe family hopes that there is police body camera video or eyewitness evidence that can demonstrate whether this type of force, which they believe was excessive, was actually required,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cThe reason communities of color around America are so enraged is because it seems to be a \u2018shoot first, ask question later\u2019 scenario when it comes to police interactions with people from our neighbourhood.\u201d</p> <p>Friends and relatives were due to attend a community rally at the Greater Bethel Baptist church in Pompano Beach later on Monday to pay their respects to Frazier, a landscaper, with family members and religious leaders planning to address the crowd.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/apr/27/corey-jones-police-fatal-shooting-florida-grand-jury\">Police officer to face grand jury in killing of black man on Florida highway</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Veda Coleman-Wright, a spokeswoman for the BSO, said the two unnamed deputies had been placed on administrative leave while detectives continued to investigate the case.</p> <p>\u201cWhen deputies arrived, someone in the house directed them to the backyard where they encountered the subject who produced a knife.

While Zuckerberg continues to insist that his corporation is a \u201cplatform\u201d and \u201ctech company\u201d \u2013 and not a media site or publisher \u2013 the reality is that Facebook has <a href=\"http://www.journalism.org/2016/05/26/news-use-across-social-media-platforms-2016/\">become</a> a primary news source for many users and a vital tool for reporters.</p> <p>Facebook\u2019s expanding power in the media business has created anxiety for news publishers, who have lost ad revenue as a result and have lamented how Facebook\u2019s algorithms can drive or <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2014-02-11/facebook-puts-a-downer-on-upworthy\">kill traffic to news sites</a>.</p> <p>The temporary ban against King offers a reminder of how much control Facebook has \u2013 and how the site doesn\u2019t always get it right when choosing what content to allow or reject.</p> <p>\u201cI love Facebook.

He was not at all happy with the sloppy, snoozeful first half, but pretty chuffed at the end:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Only the second half. I was really disappointed about our first 45 minutes. From the start it was not the Everton I like to see. We lost a lot of easy balls. Too many players not on the level in our ball possession. We had difficulties. The second half, that was what I like to see. Good football, good pressing, and we had opportunities to score more goals.</p> <p>I told the players I was really angry about our team. I think we had good defending, that was not the problem. The problem is when we had ball possession in midfield, in front, we lost the ball too many times. You need a good reaction and that reaction came in the second half. I know the players, I know the level they can achieve, and that is the level we saw in the second half, not the first half.</p> <p>I did not have doubts about Lukaku. I think the two goals Romelu scored with Belgium gave him a real boost, and it\u2019s unbelievable how good he can be. I told him the best answer is always on the pitch, and he showed the goals tonight. A great performance.</p> <p>[On Gueye\u2019s performance] Fantastic. Maybe he was the key tonight. He\u2019s that player with a lot of energy, and on the ball he\u2019s quiet and he takes good possession. He\u2019s a key player that you need in midfield and I think it\u2019s a great signing for us.</p> <p>I think we will be one of the teams who fight for European football. That\u2019s a realistic target, and we showed that in the second half.

We didn\u2019t keep the ball, we didn\u2019t create enough, except one clear chance which I missed. But the second half we played a lot better. My fitness levels weren\u2019t as good as I wanted them to be. I could have had five tonight. I have to be more of a serial killer if I want to help the team achieve its objective. We have to keep going as a team.</p> </blockquote> <p>And then, Leighton Baines:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I\u2019m delighted for Rom and for us. We know he\u2019s got goals in him, his goalscoring record is phenomenal. We all know the goals are going to come. He\u2019s shown tonight what he\u2019s all about. I think we started from scratch. You\u2019ve got to be crystal clear on the fundamentals, what our principals are, what we want to achieve. That\u2019s what we started from. I think the team spirit is fantastic at the moment.

Today the managerial spotlight falls upon David Moyes, erstwhile long-term occupant of the Everton hotseat and now patrolling Sunderland\u2019s technical area. He\u2019s had little luck so far, with the Black Cats\u2019 first three games bringing just a single point, won at Southampton a couple of weeks back. Everton meanwhile are unbeaten, having economically converted four league goals into seven league points.</p> <p>There could be more scoring tonight. After all, this tends to be an entertaining fixture, having produced seven goalless draws \u2013 the last in 1983 \u2013 in precisely 180 previous meetings, while there are 10 occasions on which the home team has scored either six or seven goals, and a further five on which one of the two sides scored five. And both teams have happy recent memories of their meetings: Everton won 6-2 at home last November, while Sunderland secured their top-flight status with a 3-0 victory here in May.

Before the acid attack he had stalked her for 10 months, repeating his proposals and often becoming violent toward her when she rejected him. </p> <p>The acid burned the skin on her face and arms and she spent the two and a half months after the attack in hospital. Over the years she has had seven operations, costing a total of 20,000,000 rupees, or roughly \u00a322,000, all of which had to be paid for by her family and friends. Her attacker was eventually jailed in 2009 for 10 years.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"0643c6e3e9c679516d0c6655e40faf0c25e9fc26\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0643c6e3e9c679516d0c6655e40faf0c25e9fc26/0_113_2133_2664/801.jpg\" alt=\"Laxmi on the catwalk at the British Asian Trust charity fashion show on Monday.\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Laxmi on the catwalk at the British Asian Trust charity fashion show on Monday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Stillwell/PA Wire</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Laxmi, now 28, has gone on to become one of India\u2019s most prominent campaigners against acid attacks. She is in London to walk the catwalk at the Hilton Waldorf hotel in a fashion show to raise awareness about violence against women.</p> <p>The event, organised by the British Asian Trust and women\u2019s rights charity GMSP, also features British woman Adele Bellis who is also the survivor of an acid attack, orchestrated by her former partner in August 2014.</p> <p>Laxmi said she was shocked to learn that the number of acid attacks in the UK has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/sep/30/acid-attack-hospital-admissions-have-almost-doubled-in-last-10-years\">almost doubled in the past 10 years</a>.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I found out that this is happening in the UK I was really surprised because I thought of course crimes would exist in a country like [India], but I never thought that something like this would exist. I was really shocked.\u201d</p> <p>Laxmi said the attack had a profound effect on her and her entire family. Her brother and father died in the same year, shortly after her attack \u2013 her brother from tuberculosis, which she believes didn\u2019t get adequate treatment because the family was so focused on her, and her father from a heart attack she believes resulted from the strain of her attack.</p> <p>Despite this, her advice to those who have suffered acid attacks, and other forms of violence like rape and domestic abuse, was to resist despondency.</p> <p>\u201cThe world will automatically turn you into a victim and victimise you. I would say instead of having a mentality that makes you feel like a victim, become a fighter and become a voice for the people who are going through these things. So you can strengthen those who are going through violence.\u201d</p> <p>In 2013, and after lobbying from Laxmi\u2019s organisation <a href=\"http://www.stopacidattacks.org/\">Stop Acid Attacks</a>, legislation was introduced in India that means all medical treatment for acid attack victims is paid for by the government. She has also been instrumental in getting legislation passed that regulates the sale of acid and gets compensation for the victims. She says that while these laws are good, there is a long way to go with enforcement and it is still very easy for people to buy acid in India and very difficult for victims to get access to the specialised medical treatment they need.</p> <p>Laxmi has travelled to London with her partner and fellow anti-acid attack campaigner, Alok Dixit, and their 17-month-old daughter, She. Laxmi says having a family like this is something she thought would be impossible </p> <p>\u201c[After the attack] each person who came to our home would say, \u2018The perpetrator could have cut your hand, he could have pulled your hair, he could have thrown acid elsewhere. Why did he choose to throw acid on your face because now you can never get married,\u2019\u201d said Laxmi. </p> <p>\u201cAt the time I couldn\u2019t even look or think past this episode, it was too overwhelming. Forget thinking about marriage at the time, I couldn\u2019t even think about life beyond this. But who would\u2019ve known I would find love in the end.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>The battle over UK arms sales to Saudi Arabia is likely to intensify because the chairman of the foreign affairs select committee, Crispin Blunt, is preparing to propose a completely new report into the sales and says the parliamentary system of monitoring arms sales needs to be recast.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/23/uk-in-denial-over-saudi-arms-sales-being-used-in-yemen-claims-oxfam\">UK in denial over Saudi arms sales being used in Yemen, claims Oxfam</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A previous draft report prepared by the arms export controls select committee was set to call for a suspension of UK arms sales to Saudi pending an independent investigation into the way the Saudi-led coalition was conducting a bombing campaign in Yemen. There have been accusations of repeated indiscriminate air raids on civilians by the Saudis that amount to a breach of international humanitarian law.</p> <p>Such a call for suspension of arms sales would represent a huge change to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/09/boris-johnson-urged-call-release-bahraini-campaigner-nabeel-rajab-new-york-times\">UK foreign policy in the Middle East</a> and cause deep unease in the defence industry.</p> <p>At a private meeting of the arms export controls committee Blunt led criticism of what he described as a one-sided draft report and was reported to have walked out to prevent some committee members from voting on the draft. His walkout reportedly meant his fellow foreign affairs select committee members could not vote since they lacked a quorum.</p> <p>In an effort to resolve the impasse, Blunt has drafted his own report and is expected to ask fellow members of the foreign affairs committee to endorse his findings at a meeting on Tuesday. The draft is likely to defer any suggestion of a ban on arms sales at least until a court case on whether the arms sales are in breach of UK law.</p> <p>The UK government is supposed to withhold arms export licences if there is a serious risk that the arms will be used in breach of international humanitarian law.</p> <p>The foreign affairs committee alternative draft, if endorsed, would then be sent to the arms controls export committee for consideration. </p> <p>The arms exports committee is a rare hybrid, which includes members of the select committees on foreign affairs, international development, business and defence. </p> <p>Blunt also appears to be suggesting that the arms export control committee, partly due to its structure, is too unwieldy and should be abandoned. It is argued it would be better if responsibility for monitoring arms sales were handed to a new select committee responsible for overseeing the work of the new department for international trade.</p> <p>Blunt has already called for the privileges committee to investigate leaks \u2013 to the BBC\u2019s Newsnight and the Guardian \u2013 of the draft report on Saudi arms sales. He has suggested private investigators be commissioned to do so. </p>",

Machar reportedly has a home in the same neighbourhood.</p> <p>The document says: \u201cThe key catalyst of South Sudan\u2019s civil war has been competition for the grand prize, control over state assets and the country\u2019s abundant natural resources between rival kleptocratic networks led by President Kiir and (former) Vice-President Machar.</p> <p>\u201cThe leaders of South Sudan\u2019s warring parties manipulate and exploit ethnic divisions in order to drum up support for a conflict that serves the interests only of the top leaders of these two kleptocratic networks and, ultimately, the international facilitators whose services the networks utilize and on which they rely.\u201d</p> <p>Kiir\u2019s 12-year-old son held a 25% stake in a holding company formed in February this year. Overall, there was evidence that at least seven of Kiir\u2019s children, as well as his wife, have held stakes in various business ventures, the report said. Journalists were shown several passports for individuals who gave their occupation as \u201cpresident\u2019s son\u201d.</p> <p>Clooney\u2019s fellow actor and campaigner Don Cheadle said: \u201cThe Sentry has found evidence that these top officials responsible for mass atrocities in South Sudan have managed to accumulate fortunes and have been involved in illegal transactions, insider deals and outright fraud.</p> <p>\u201cImmediate family members of President Kiir and his wife have held interests in almost two dozen companies operating in oil, mining, construction, gambling, banking, telecommunications, aviation and government and military procurement.\u201d</p> <p>The Sentry said its undercover investigators pored over thousands of pages of legal records, corporate filings, financial statements and other official correspondence, tracked suspects on social media and used satellite imagery to gather and analyse data. The researchers travelled to locations including Melbourne, Adelaide, Kampala, Juba, Cairo and Nairobi to gather evidence and interview hundreds of experts and eyewitnesses.</p> <p>The investigation focused on top officials with command authority over those responsible for mass atrocities, he added. They have accumulated personal fortunes despite modest salaries. Gen Paul Malong, the chief of military staff, owns two villas in Uganda in addition to a $2m mansion in a gated community in Nairobi, according to the report, which cites his annual salary as roughly $45,000.</p> <p>Among Kiir\u2019s associates, Lawrence Lual Malong Jr, 28, describes himself as \u201cYoung Tycoon\u201d and \u201cSmart Boy for Life\u201d, according to the report, which includes social media photos of him wearing gaudy blue, purple and yellow suits in the first class section of various planes.</p> <p>Veteran activist John Prendergast said: \u201cThis is not a study of a few corrupt officials in Africa \u2026 What it is is an attempt to get at the nexus of what drives violent conflict and mass atrocities in South Sudan: the connection between endemic corruption and deadly violence and about how these networks benefit from a system that\u2019s built on corruption and uses extreme violence to keep in place.\u201d</p> <p>The report claimed individuals and major firms outside South Sudan had facilitated the deadly corruption. It said there was hard evidence of foreign companies making direct payments to the bank accounts of high-ranking South Sudanese generals. The banks that process the transactions also play a role, it said. Cheadle added: \u201cThese companies and banks can no longer say they didn\u2019t know.\u201d</p> <p>Clooney and his colleagues said they would present the findings to Obama and urge the international community, including South Sudan\u2019s neighbours, to crack down on banks that fail to stop dubious transactions, and impose asset freezes on those responsible for human rights violations.</p> <p>Contacted by the Guardian, Ateny Wek Ateny, a spokesperson for Kiir, said he was reading the report. \u201cWe will be able to respond tomorrow.

He was quoted at 66-1 to win the title as recently as late July but is now a 2-7 chance to win his first championship.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a landmark and it\u2019s a bit harder to get to the 100 now that they\u2019ve shortened the season so it\u2019s nice to get there,\u201d Crowley said after his victory on Upstaging.</p> <p>\u201cYou become obsessed by it but it\u2019s a good thing. It\u2019s very important to me and I\u2019m just going to do my best, which is all I can do really. We\u2019ve still got a long way to go yet [until the Flat championship ends at Ascot on 15 October]; we\u2019ve seen in the last couple of weeks how things can flip-flop.\u201d</p> <p>The excitement of being in the thick of a title race for the first time in his career also means that Crowley is thriving on the hard graft required to maintain his challenge. \u201cI\u2019m buzzing off it at the moment. I don\u2019t feel tired at all and there\u2019s plenty of time for a rest [once the title race is over],\u201d he said. \u201cAll you can do is put the horse in the right position in the race and, if it\u2019s good enough, it will win. If it doesn\u2019t, there\u2019s always another day, so that\u2019s all you can do really.\u201d</p> <p>Crowley lives 25 miles from Brighton and he would have been home after his double with plenty of time to keep up with De Sousa\u2019s progress at Wolverhampton. His obsession with the title race has its limits, however. \u201cI think I\u2019ll probably watch something else on the telly,\u201d he said, \u201cand then check the results tomorrow.\u201d</p> <p>Jockey Club Racecourses will dangle the incentive of a \u00a31m bonus once again during this year\u2019s National Hunt season, for the connections of a chaser that can complete its \u201cChasing Triple Crown\u201d in the Betfair Chase at Haydock, the King George VI Chase at Kempton and the Cheltenham Gold Cup in March.</p> <p>Last season, Cue Card took the first two legs before falling on the final circuit in the Gold Cup when still travelling well. JCR has, in effect, insured the bonus with a relatively small \u201cbet\u201d from its marketing budget and bookmakers believe that a successful completion of the Triple Crown is long odds-against.</p> <p>Several offer prices about individual horses, including Cue Card and Coneygree, the 2015 Gold Cup winner, winning all three races but many punters may gravitate towards BetVictor, who offer 33-1 about any horse picking up the bonus.</p> <p>Meanwhile, John Hunt, who had been widely tipped to be the principal commentator for ITV Racing when terrestrial racing coverage moves to its new home from Channel 4 in January, said on Monday night that he will instead remain with the BBC, where he will be able to work on a range of sports in addition to his commentary commitments for Radio Five Live.</p> <p>Hunt recently worked on the swimming events at the Rio Olympics, an experience that may have been crucial in persuading him to stay with his current employer, on a new deal that will run until the Tokyo Olympics in 2020 and may also include wider opportunities for Hunt to commentate on football.</p> <p>Hunt told the Racing Post on Monday evening that the BBC offered \u201cexciting opportunities\u2026 off the back of one of the best experiences of my life in Rio\u201d. His decision will be seen as a setback for ITV Racing, which has signed a contract to broadcast at least 34 fixtures each year on its main channel, and 60 more on ITV4.</p>",
  "<p>\u201cWho, at the internet\u2019s inception, would have foreseen the rise and rise of radio, or the renaissance of that archaic word, \u2018wireless\u2019?\u201d So muses the narrator of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/aug/27/nutshell-by-ian-mcewan-review\" title=\"\">Ian McEwan\u2019s new novel Nutshell</a>, a foetus who is also a Hamlet-figure \u201cbounded in a nutshell\u201d. It is an observation magnificently borne out by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/sep/11/the-archers-verdict-on-helen-tichener-aired\" title=\"\">the hour-long Archers special</a> broadcast on Sunday evening. It would be an exaggeration to claim the entire nation was gripped by the culmination of Helen Titchener\u2019s trial for the attempted murder of her husband, the dastardly Rob. But a healthy chunk of it was.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/sep/11/the-archers-verdict-on-helen-titchener-lights-up-social-media\" title=\"\">Social media was bristling</a> with comment on the jury\u2019s deliberations. The Guardian was not alone in running a front-page <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/sep/11/the-archers-verdict-on-helen-tichener-aired\" title=\"\">story on the verdict</a>. Around the UK, life stopped as people listened. It was an echo of older, more attentive forms of hearing than we are used to&#xa0;today, when wireless listeners tuned in to the evening\u2019s programme for several hours.</p> <p>For all that the jury-room arguments of Sunday\u2019s episode were a little overwritten, with a host of state-of-the-nation issues from Brexit to Islamophobia crammed into the discussions, the show gained its power from the sheer brilliance of the build-up: a storyline that had been painstakingly constructed over the past two and a half years. The tale of Helen, abused, manipulated and bullied until she stabbed her controlling husband, had a distinct flavour of Hardy\u2019s Tess of the D\u2019Urbervilles, with a dash of Patrick Hamilton\u2019s Gaslight. Audio is glowing in the midst of an unexpected golden age: the patient, slow, detailed reporting of the two seasons of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/serial\" title=\"\">Serial</a>, the US podcast from WBEZ Chicago, had a similar grip on its listeners.</p> <p>It was not just the way the story was told, though, but the story itself. Of course many people knew about domestic abuse and coercive control \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/dec/29/domestic-abuse-law-controlling-coercive-behaviour\" title=\"\">which this year became a crime punishable by up to five years in prison</a> \u2013 without The Archers. But the show demonstrated the power of drama, and of brilliant writing, to animate the darkest corners of human life and to shift them from&#xa0;the realm of abstract argument to that&#xa0;of&#xa0;emotion and empathy.</p> <p>In a soap opera that, at times, is a little cosy (with its cake-making, village cricket and harvest suppers), Helen\u2019s story did not flinch from addressing the deep and real misogyny that is rife in British society. It&#xa0;is a misogyny exemplified by a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/sep/12/girls-quality-of-life-shows-huge-variation-around-the-country-report\" title=\"\">report this week showing the disparities in life chances</a> for girls growing&#xa0;up in different parts of the country. It is a misogyny that, meanwhile, is&#xa0;becoming less and less acceptable \u2013 witness, for example, Nottingham police\u2019s recent foray into investigating <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/sep/10/misogyny-hate-crime-nottingham-police-crackdown\" title=\"\">sexist abuse as&#xa0;a hate crime</a>. Perhaps it is time The Archers&#xa0;tackled more big stories with similar gusto. (Though&#xa0;it has been excellent on issues from&#xa0;flooding to GM crops, housing and racism, the characters never discuss party&#xa0;politics.)</p> <p>Above all, The Archers has shown the power of stories told in sound, and has proved that they are capable of being much more than aural background. Audio is a medium that floods the imagination with possibilities. It is at once universal and entirely personal, a friendly and yet expansive voice in the ear. \u201cOne has never talked to so few people, or so many; it\u2019s very queer,\u201d remarked Vita Sackville-West after her first broadcast in 1928. With the radio, one indeed can be bounded in a nutshell, and&#xa0;king of infinite space.</p>",
  "<p>Justine Greening, the education secretary, has outlined the government\u2019s proposals for driving up standards in English schools, but she received a sceptical reaction from some Conservatives about the most controversial part of the plan \u2013 expanding grammar schools. </p> <p>Given the Conservatives\u2019 working Commons majority of 17, the fact that more than a dozen Tory backbenchers expressed concern as they questioned Greening highlighted the battle Theresa May\u2019s government faces over the grammar schools proposals.</p> <p>After the debate, Nicky Morgan, Greening\u2019s predecessor as education secretary, told ITV News that it would be \u201cdifficult to support the proposals\u201d as they stood on grammar schools, and predicted a tough Commons battle. \u201cI think the government has a real challenge on getting this through,\u201d she said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"c0d074df1cd8679251cd109b4e02d130ac2b9edd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c0d074df1cd8679251cd109b4e02d130ac2b9edd/0_99_2385_1431/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Justine Greening\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Justine Greening has said government plans were aimed at boosting social mobility.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joe Giddens/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Another apparent critic was Michael Gove, also a former education secretary and onetime Tory leadership hopeful, who lavished high praise on Greening while offering a coded attack on the plans outlined in a government consultation paper.<br></p> <p>Hailing his successor\u2019s \u201cclear moral purpose\u201d in seeking to raise school standards, Gove praised plans to encourage private schools and universities to offer more help to state schools.</p> <p>However, he was notably silent on grammars and ended his address by urging Greening to \u201cbe driven entirely by data and what works\u201d, a pointed appeal given the majority of studies on grammar schools suggest they do not help social mobility \u2013 a finding reiterated on Tuesday in a <a href=\"https://www.ifs.org.uk/publications/8469\">report by the Institute for Fiscal Studies</a>.</p> <p>While much of the debate has been about the return of selection, this is just one of four elements in <a href=\"https://consult.education.gov.uk/school-frameworks/schools-that-work-for-everyone/supporting_documents/SCHOOLS%20THAT%20WORK%20FOR%20EVERYONE%20%20FINAL.pdf\">the green paper</a>, which is seeking consultation responses until mid-December.</p> <p>On grammars, it suggests repealing the <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1998/31/contents\">1998 law</a> that stopped the creation of new grammar schools in England.

  "<p>Denial is textbook Oscar bait: an autumn release recounting an inspiring real story about fighting prejudice, led by a showy performance from an Oscar winner, written by an award-winning playwright, and buffeted by a swelling, emotional score.

Students say hello as she passes them by in the corridor, as if on Sesame Street. Weisz, usually a nuanced talent, sells her character too forcefully from the get-go; a scene where she gives an impassioned lecture at Emory university in Atlanta, where she teaches Jewish studies, is like a monologue for drama school.</p> <p>Her speech is interrupted by a man who identifies himself as David Irving (Timothy Spall), a known Holocaust denier she explicitly labelled as such in her 1993 book Denying the Holocaust. He challenges her, absurdly, to debate whether the Holocaust ever happened, but she refuses. \u201cI won\u2019t debate fact,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Fast-forward two years: Irving sues her for libel all the way from England, on the grounds that her recent book has ruined the once well-regarded military historian\u2019s career.

There\u2019s a provocative scene where Lipstadt is pressured at a dinner in London to settle with Irving to avoid giving him a platform to spout his hate-filled nonsense. \u201cHe does these things for his glory,\u201d she\u2019s told. Hare makes the parallels to the media\u2019s treatment of Donald Trump during this US election cycle ring loud and clear. Another scene that sees Lipstadt and her lawyers visit the concentration camp at Auschwitz is sensitively handled and undeniably affecting.</p> <p>Much of the rest, however, is presented as a standard issue legal drama with broad stakes and zero nuance. Lipstadt is written as an impassioned mouthpiece with no internal life, and Weisz does little to humanise her, relying on a broad Queens accent to somehow define the character. It doesn\u2019t help she\u2019s forced to sport a red mop of a wig that\u2019s wholly unconvincing.</p> <p>The rest of the cast fares better, notably Tom Wilkinson as Lipstadt\u2019s Scottish lawyer who makes Irving squirm in the stand. But, under the workmanlike direction of Mick Jackson (The Bodyguard), what should have been a rousing and ragingly topical crowdpleaser, instead feels more like a Lifetime movie.</p>",
  "<p>Once we had forests and children, like my dad, John, roamed them freely. One day in the 1950s, he encountered a forester (now an extinct species, like the free-roaming child) in a nearby wood. The old woodman showed him how to use a billhook; John slung his hook and gashed his&#xa0;knee.</p> <p>I only learned this story when reading A Tale of Trees, a new book by Guardian country diarist <a href=\"http://www.whispersfromthewild.co.uk/books-by-derek-niemann/a-tale-of-trees/\" title=\"\">Derek Niemann</a>, who recounts a very human story of vanishing forests.

He had drilled holes and banged nails into this lump without any maiming because he was under close supervision, as I saw from photos \u2013 which hard-pressed nursery teachers now spend their weekends sending to parents.</p> <p>A free-roaming childhood is gone forever, more because of the volume of traffic than the loss of open woodland, but this need not be a source of despair.</p> <p>Forest schools represent the best of the present and are a sign that we are belatedly recognising woodland as a supreme setting for the learning that comes from free play outdoors.

Helena Smith reports from Athens:</p> <blockquote> <p>It\u2019s September. The summer is over and the auditors are back. There is, and has always been, a cyclical quality to Greece\u2019s long-running debt crisis but six years on it is a sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu that comes against a background of poverty and immiseration made worse by the passage of time. Talks resumed today with inspectors focusing on accelerating the government\u2019s long-delayed privatisation program and rooting out corruption \u2013 endemic and, as such, a major curse for the economy. </p> <p>Once again Athens has been told in no uncertain terms that the heat is on: failure to implement 15 major prior actions, or reforms, will result in non-disbursement of the next tranche of aid, at \u20ac2.8bn vital for the debt-stricken economy. Publicly, the leftist-led government is keen to complete what will amount to a second review of the economy in the 13 months since it signed up to a third, \u20ac86bn bailout as soon as possible. Finance ministry sources speak of September 29, when the next Euro working group is held, as a deadline.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c7d7bb839be19359b56966624f131465e79a0312\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c7d7bb839be19359b56966624f131465e79a0312/0_117_2554_1533/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alexis Tsipras.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alexis Tsipras.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alexandros Avramidis/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <blockquote> <p>Creditors have also made clear that debt relief negotiations \u2013 central for real economic recovery to even begin \u2013 can only be countenanced once further austerity is enforced. Such policies would include abolishment of protection laws against mass lay-offs \u2013 a huge red line for the ruling Syriza party.</p> <p>And prime minister Alexis Tsipras, once the pin-up for anti-austerians Europe-wide, is feeling the heat. Latest polls have repeatedly shown the leftists to be trailing the main opposition centre right New Democracy party with approval ratings for Tsipras himself plummeting. One recent survey showed only 19% of Greeks viewed the leader favorably with a massive 85% dissatisfied with a government they had initially voted in to dismantle policies blamed for run-away unemployment and soaring impoverishment. The leftists\u2019 penchant for replacing cuts with taxes has exacerbated the disgruntlement. All of which is why few believe this latest chapter will end anytime soon - with ever growing numbers believing that Greece will only regain competitiveness when it eventually leaves the eurozone. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57d6cf10e4b013613fffc863\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-12T16:01:43.283Z\">5.01pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The final scores in Europe showed:</p> <ul> <li><strong>The FTSE 100 finished down 76.05 points or 1.12% at 6700.90, its lowest level since the start of August</strong></li> <li><strong>Germany\u2019s Dax was down 1.34% at 10,431.77</strong></li> <li><strong>France\u2019s Cac closed 1.15% lower at 4439.80</strong></li> <li><strong>Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 1.84% to 16,840.28</strong></li> <li><strong>Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 1.76% lower at 8866.6</strong></li> <li><strong>In Greece, the Athens market lost 1.68% to 557.25</strong></li> </ul> <p>On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 63 points or 0.36%.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-09-12T16:02:01.448Z\">at 5.02pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57d6cb33e4b013613fffc852\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-12T15:40:11.973Z\">4.40pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Markets recover from post-Brexit lows</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>After early plunges this morning, European markets have recovered from their worst levels.</p> <p>For much of the day the FTSE 100 was suffering its worst day since the immediate aftermath of the Brexit vote in June, with a similar story on the Dax.</p> <p>Much of the falls came after Friday\u2019s comments from Federal Reserve members suggesting a US rate rise was possible next week, with the news of Hillary Clinton\u2019s illness adding to the uncertainty.</p> <p>But Wall Street regained its poise and in turn gave a lift to European markets.

This afternoon\u2019s speech from Fed\u2019s Brainard represents the final appearance before the pre-meeting blackout period.

Loyalty, to the party and its leader, counts a great deal for him, more perhaps than it does for some of his predecessors. (Sir John Major has been broadly loyal to his successors, but Major\u2019s two Tory PM predecessors, Margaret Thatcher and Edward Heath, were notorious for their unwelcome backseat driving.) And today Cameron has been quite explicit about why he is leaving the Commons; while stressing that he generally supported Theresa May, he also said that he had his \u201cown views about different issues\u201d and that he did not want to be a \u201cdistraction\u201d.</p> <p>By distraction he meant \u201crebel\u201d. He is not going to be able to honestly support May on everything, and so he would rather leave the Commons than stay on and turn into Ted Heath. (As a former prime minister it will still be interesting to know what he thinks about government policy, but his views will be less relevant if he is no longer an MP and, crucially, he will not be expected to vote for measures he does not back.)</p> <p>Cameron insisted that this was not just about grammar schools and that his decision had nothing to do with \u201cany one individual issue\u201d. (See<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/sep/12/tuc-leader-says-labour-must-start-focusing-on-what-voters-want-politics-live?page=with:block-57d6c532e4b08465d44ffe08#block-57d6c532e4b08465d44ffe08\"> 4.25pm.) </a>This is almost certainly true. Here are five issues that probably helped Cameron come to the view that he was best off no longer serving as an MP with May as prime minister.<br></p> <p><strong>1 - Grammar schools.</strong> Cameron says there are \u201cvery many good things\u201d in May\u2019s grammar school policy, but his comments (see <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/sep/12/tuc-leader-says-labour-must-start-focusing-on-what-voters-want-politics-live?page=with:block-57d6c532e4b08465d44ffe08#block-57d6c532e4b08465d44ffe08\">4.25pm)</a> also make it clear that he has strong reservations too. That\u2019s not surprising. \u201cIn 18 years of Conservative government, we didn\u2019t create a whole big number of grammar schools because parents fundamentally don\u2019t want their children divided into sheep and goats at the age of 11,\u201d <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/6658613.stm\">he said in 2007.</a> There is nothing to suggest he has changed his mind.</p> <p><strong>2 - Faith school expansion.</strong> The grammar school aspect of May\u2019s policy is the one that has received the most attention, but the faith school proposals are very contentious too. Today\u2019s Times carries an article by Clare Foges, a former Cameron speechwriter, saying that allowing faith schools to expand without having to mix their intake would produce \u201cmore mono-cultural, mono-faith, mono-racial schools. More bubbles. More parallel lives\u201d. (See<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/sep/12/tuc-leader-says-labour-must-start-focusing-on-what-voters-want-politics-live?page=with:block-57d67696e4b07ac3d446b52c#block-57d67696e4b07ac3d446b52c\"> 10.39am.)</a> Foges was publishing her own views, not Cameron\u2019s, but he resisted the proposal that May is adopting when he was prime minister and so he may well agree with his former aide.</p> <p><strong>3 - Europe. </strong>After Britain voted for Brexit Cameron told MPs that it would be up to his successor to decide what relationship the UK formed with the EU but that he thought \u201cit is in all our interests, whatever the eventual decision, to make sure we are as close as possible economically to our friends and partners in the European Union\u201d. <a href=\"https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2016-06-27/debates/1606275000001/OutcomeOfTheEUReferendum#contribution-16062713000091\">Put more bluntly, \u201cthe closer, the better\u201d, he said. </a>With David Davis, the Brexit minister, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/sep/05/david-davis-brexit-commons-statement-leaving-uk-since-brexit-vote-poll-suggests-politics-live?page=with:block-57cda570e4b0c2a396c06e89#block-57cda570e4b0c2a396c06e89\">virtually saying the UK will have to leave the single market</a>, and Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/11/boris-johnson-backs-brexit-pressure-campaign-change-britain\">backing what is seen as a \u201chard\u201d Brexit campaign</a>, Cameron may have already concluded his advice will be ignored.</p> <p><strong>4 - China. </strong>Cameron\u2019s government made forging a strong partnership with China a key priority. May\u2019s decision to postpone the decision to give the new Hinkley Point power station project the go-ahead shows she takes a very different view.</p> <p><strong>5 - Reshuffle. </strong>May was always going to appoint her own cabinet and ministerial team, but the extent to which she was willing to purge the Notting Hill Cameroons took many MPs by surprise. It would be surprising if Cameron was not at least a little disappointed about the way figures like George Osborne and Oliver Letwin were treated.</p> <p>One other point: not for the first time, Cameron is living up to his \u201cheir to Blair\u201d reputation. Former prime ministers always used to stay on in the Commons at least until the subsequent election because triggering a byelection just to avoid the fate of having to be a backbencher seemed indulgent. But Tony Blair set a new trend when he decided to resign from the Commons on the day he left Downing Street.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-09-12T16:18:42.499Z\">at 5.18pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57d6c532e4b08465d44ffe08\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-12T15:25:21.350Z\">4.25pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Cameron hints he does not fully support May's plans for new grammar schools</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here is a lightly edited account of the rest of Chris Ship\u2019s interview with <strong>David Cameron. </strong>I posted a transcript of the first half of it a<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/sep/12/tuc-leader-says-labour-must-start-focusing-on-what-voters-want-politics-live?page=with:block-57d6be05e4b013613fffc7f9#block-57d6be05e4b013613fffc7f9\">t 3.50pm.</a></p> <p>(I have paraphrased some of the questions, but not the answers, obviously.)</p> <p><em>Q: You were opposed to a return to grammar schools. Resigning so soon after Theresa May\u2019s speech suggests you could not support that policy.</em></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><em><strong>DC:</strong></em> This decision has got nothing to do with any one individual issue and the timing in that way is, I promise, is coincidental. But it goes to a bigger picture, really, which is whatever the issue, as a former prime minister being a backbench MP, I think, it is difficult just not to be a distraction, a diversion and therefore build a sort of reputation for yourself in politics that I don\u2019t really want to have. I wish her well, I wish the government well.</p> <p>In a way there\u2019s a link to the decision to resign as prime minister. The country made a decision, a decision I advised against but nonetheless the decision has been made. I want the government to successfully pursue that decision and to get it right. And as a result I think not being a backbencher but leaving parliament is the right thing to do.</p> </blockquote> <p><em>Q: Do you or do you not support the expansion of grammar schools?</em></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><strong>DC:</strong> There\u2019s very many good things in the policy. We actually when I was prime minister agreed to the expansion of grammar schools in areas where they already where. We set up sixth forms that were selective in our big cities as free schools, so lots of merit in the policy. But frankly I don\u2019t want to get into the whys and wherefores of this individual policy ...</p> </blockquote> <p><em>Q: This suggests you simply do not support the expansion of grammar schools. </em></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><strong>DC:</strong> I think there\u2019s some merit in the policy that is being put forward. My announcement today is not about grammar schools. There\u2019s no connection with grammar schools, it\u2019s purely one of timing. My view is, as I\u2019ve said, I don\u2019t want to be the distraction and diversion that the former prime minister inevitably is on the backbenches.</p> <p>So it\u2019s with a heavy heart because I love this part of the world, I\u2019ve loved being an MP, I\u2019m going to go on living here. Being a constituency MP is a great and fulfilling job but I\u2019ve come to the conclusion that the best thing is to stand down.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>Cameron hints he does not fully support Theresa May\u2019s plans to open new grammar schools.</strong></li> </ul> <p><em><strong>Q</strong>: You will be remembered mostly for taking this country out of the EU, won\u2019t you?</em></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><strong>DC</strong>: I\u2019m sure I will be remembered for keeping that pledge to hold areferendum when many people thought that promise would never be kept but I hope that people will look back at the 11 years I was leader of the Conservative party and six years as prime minister of our country as a time when we did create a stronger economy \u2013 1,000 people found work for every day I was prime minister \u2013 and we did make some important social reforms ... and the Conservative party went from being in the doldrums and getting beaten to being a modernising winning force in British politics. But the historians will have to work all that out. I obviously now am going to be looking at a new life, but I\u2019m only 49 \u2013 I hope I can still contribute in terms of public service and contribute to our country.</p> </blockquote> <p><em>Q: What will your new life outside the Commons involve? </em></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><strong>DC</strong>: I haven\u2019t made firm decisions, I need to look at all of that. The only firm decision I\u2019ve made is to leave the House of Commons and stop being an MP \u2013 as I say, with a heavy heart because I\u2019ve loved the jobs but I don\u2019t think it works for a former prime minister who resigned in my circumstances and with all the new government needs to do.</p> <p>Issues for the future.

Asked if May welcomed this, the spokeswoman said: </li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The government is absolutely committed to delivering on the decision of the British people to leave the EU ... The government and the cabinet are already getting on with it.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>Number 10 brushed aside the TUC general secretary Frances O\u2019Grady\u2019s claim that not guaranteeing EU citizens resident in the UK the right to stay after Brexit was \u201cimmoral\u201d</strong>. Asked about this, the spokeswoman said that May hoped to be in a position to let them stay and that the only circumstances in which they would not be allowed to stay would be \u201cif European countries were not able to make commitments with regard to the position of British nationals\u201d.</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>The spokeswoman claimed the government was \u201cmaking progress\u201d in terms of its commitment to take in Syrian refugees, including vulnerable children.</strong> More than 120 unaccompanied child refugees have come to the UK since the start of the year, she said, and more than 30 children have been admitted since the Immigration Act became law in May under the provisions of that legislation. The UK had already committed to resettle 20,000 vulnerable refugees from camps near to Syria over a five-year period and to take 3,000 children and their families from the region under the Children at Risk scheme. The Immigration Act set out measures to take in unaccompanied refugee children who were already in Europe before March 20 this year, \u201cwhere it is in their best interests\u201d, but set no figure on the numbers who might be allowed into the UK. </li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>Downing Street said the Ministry of Justice was now investigating <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3784457/Huge-rise-debt-judgements-against-families.html\">today\u2019s Daily Mail allegations about thousands of country court judgments being issued against people without their knowledge and without full court hearings.</a> </strong>\u201cWe have a strong legal system in this country and it\u2019s important that it cannot be abused,\u201d the spokeswoman said. \u201cThe Ministry of Justice is now taking forward work looking into this specific issue.\u201d</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>Aung San Suu Kyi, the Myanmar leader, is in London for talks and is meeting Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary, this afternoon.</strong></li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>Philip Hammond, the chancellor, is meeting British exporters this afternoon as part of a series of meetings he is holding ahead of the autumn statement.</strong></li> </ul>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"407681f80a1bae10bf6169f8a4e0275981435300\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/407681f80a1bae10bf6169f8a4e0275981435300/0_146_2556_1532/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Number 10.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Number 10.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Steve Back / Barcroft Images</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-09-12T11:23:01.475Z\">at 12.23pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57d67bbde4b08465d44ffc5d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-12T09:57:50.196Z\">10.57am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here is <a href=\"https://www.tuc.org.uk/about-tuc/congress/congress-2016/tuc-general-secretary-frances-o%E2%80%99grady%E2%80%99s-address-congress-2016\">the full text of Frances O\u2019Grady\u2019s speech to the TUC conference. </a>I will post a summary in due course, but first I\u2019m off to the Number 10 lobby briefing.

Previously, over-subscribed new schools could only select 50 per cent of pupils on the basis of religion. Now it is to be 100 per cent. More mono-cultural, mono-faith, mono-racial schools. More bubbles. More parallel lives.</p> <p>It would seem the government has been backed into a corner on this. The Conservative manifesto promise is to create 500 new free schools. The hope was that a significant chunk would come from Catholic schools, but the church resisted. It takes issue with the 50 per cent cap on religious selection. Apparently, it is against canon law \u201cfor a Catholic bishop not to prioritise the admission of Catholic pupils\u201d. The chief rabbi also resisted the 50 per cent cap.</p> <p>I find secularist harrumphing about the pernicious influence of religion pretty ridiculous on the whole, but isn\u2019t there something rather ugly about this demand that \u201cwe take care of our own\u201d to the exclusion of others? Doesn\u2019t it stick in the craw that the state will pay for this discrimination? Government guidance says it is unacceptable for schools to \u201cpromote discrimination against people or groups on the basis of their belief\u201d. So, not OK to promote it, OK to practise it.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong><a href=\"http://www.conservativehome.com/platform/2016/09/tim-farron-a-plea-to-conservative-mps-its-neither-in-britains-interest-nor-yours-to-back-mays-grammar-school-plan.html\">Tim Farron, the Lib Dem leader, uses an article for ConservativeHome to urge Tory MPs to block the proposals.</a></strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Here is the killer stat: the Sutton Trust found that less than three per cent of grammar kids were on free lunches, compared with 20 per cent across the country.</p> <p>Theresa May addresses this by talking of \u201cinclusive grammar schools\u201d. But this is a contradiction: grammars exclude. Some complicated two-tier entry taking into account socio-economic background will have MPs post-bags brimming with constituents complaining that their child was denied a place despite gaining a higher mark than another child.</p> <p>And however \u201cfairly\u201d you try to select, you won\u2019t escape the fundamental unfairness of deciding ability at the age of 11. Streaming within schools works because it allows flexibility as children flourish at different stages and in different subjects. Grammars stream people for entire school careers, and beyond.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57d66fd2e4b07ac3d446b50a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-12T09:06:10.631Z\">10.06am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Frances O\u2019Grady,</strong> the TUC general secretary, is addressing the TUC conference now.</p> <p>You can watch a live feed <a href=\"https://www.tuc.org.uk/about-tuc/congress/congress-2016/congress-2016-watch-live\">here.</a></p> <p>I will post a summary of the speech when I\u2019ve seen the text.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57d66d28e4b07ac3d446b501\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-12T09:02:01.779Z\">10.02am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>It is one year to the day since Jeremy Corbyn was elected Labour leader.</p> <p>Obviously the fact that 75% of Labour MPs backed a motion expressing no confidence in him suggests that Corbyn\u2019s first year as leader has not been an unalloyed triumph.

Or are those suggesting it labouring under the mentality of a past era, as opposed to the more touchy-feely mind-set of the current generation of millennial cricketers?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/12/jos-buttler-eoin-morgan-bangladesh-odi-captain\">Jos Buttler: criticism of Eoin Morgan unfair, he\u2019s still our captain</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This England team \u2013 specifically the one-day side \u2013 is a talented collection of young cricketers high on confidence but is one that so far appears largely ego-free. For all the personal drive that fires their performances, the main pillars beneath Morgan \u2013 Ben Stokes, Joe Root and Jos Buttler \u2013 are not currently the types to make internal capital from the situation.</p> <p>Where those three go the rest tend to follow and it was Stokes \u2013 the very heartbeat of the side, irrespective of Buttler being handed the stripes temporarily \u2013 who was quick to react on Twitter shortly after Morgan and Hales officially withdrew. He cited the need for their decisions to be respected and reasserted his support for the captain in particular. If the talisman is going out of his way to say this, as opposed to trotting it out at a press conference, you fancy it is probably on trend behind the scenes.</p> <p>As Stokes pointed out, neither player will have taken the decision lightly. Morgan scarcely appears to care how he is perceived by the public, but he will know he has exposed his place to the burgeoning talents of Sam Billings and Ben Duckett, not to mention the glowing form of the previously squeezed out Jonny Bairstow. Runs flowing for one of these thrusters in Dhaka and Chittagong would lead to awkward questions if Morgan\u2019s return to lead the side in India came at their expense.</p> <p>While Hales should be more assured of his one-day place as the second-highest run-scorer in the format since the last World Cup, his career is heading for white-ball specialism. He perhaps beat the Test selectors to the punch in this regard but even so he has still theoretically shouldered arms to a format where he craves success. Given Nottinghamshire\u2019s relegation to Division Two, he faces a long road back.</p> <p>This situation is certainly a first major bump in the road for a 50-over side that, under Morgan, has risen from the ashes of the harrowing 2015 World Cup but none of the above is to rule out the team dynamic being affected as a result. All one can hope for is that when the question of his return for India in January arises, the decision is reached from a cricketing perspective, rather than any grudge held or feeling that his leadership has been diminished as a result.</p> <p>Morgan is known to have shared with his team-mates his intention not to travel early in the recent series with Pakistan and England still crushed their opponents 4-1, hitting a world record 444 for three at Trent Bridge on the way, suggesting his leadership was not a problem then.</p> <p>Morgan and Hales may well regret their decision in years to come. They may not. But ultimately they were granted the option by the England management in the first place and so, unlike the locked-in fate of Tom Stoppard\u2019s two confused courtiers, none of the outcomes from this tangled affair should already have been written.</p>",

  "<p>Contrary to his assertion, it is Dr Austen Ivereigh (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/07/the-pope-population-and-ecological-sins\">Letters</a>, 8 September), rather than Professor Colin Green (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/06/pope-should-know-that-resisting-birth-control-is-bad-for-the-environment\">Letters</a>, 7 September), who is hindered by \u201cfirst world myopia\u201d in his attitude to the world population issue.</p> <p>Those who live or work in developing countries encounter innumerable, especially poor, women who are denied the means to control their fertility \u2013 a right the rest of us take for granted. Their ability to enhance their families\u2019 and their own welfare by spacing and limiting the number of their children is often thwarted by opposition to birth control on the part of organised religious bodies such as the Catholic church.</p> <p>Advocating family planning is not \u201celiminating the poor\u201d. It is simply a matter of enabling poor people in developing countries to exercise the choices available to rich people everywhere, including Catholics. Had this problem been addressed decades ago, a great deal of suffering could have been averted. Moreover, the human population and concomitant environmental crisis would not have reached anything like current levels.<br><strong>Jeanne Openshaw</strong><br><em>Brighton</em></p> <p>\u2022 Of course the developed countries consume too much, but that does not negate the fact that there are too many people to survive even at a lowered consumption level. We are using up the world\u2019s resources at an astounding rate. Even if everyone in the world limited their fish consumption to once a week (I don\u2019t eat other kinds of meat), the oceans would still be hovering on depletion. To say that population is not a problem on a finite planet is ridiculous.<br><strong>Katherine DelaNoy</strong><br><em>Eagle, Colorado, USA</em></p> <p>\u2022 The pope\u2019s new views on the environment are indeed welcome. Any debate on the environment that focuses solely on overconsumption by rich countries is still missing out the role played by rapid population growth in creating inequality and environmental degradation. Very poor countries such as Niger could develop faster if population growth were halted. Gains are transitory when any improvement they win, such as more children in school, is followed by a rapid rise in the number of children needing schooling. Similarly, when better farming practices bring more food, they still do not bring more land for everyone to live on. No debate on the environment should ignore either of the twin factors of population growth and overconsumption, however inconvenient this may seem to those who wish to prevent other people from using contraception.<br><strong>Helen Haran</strong><br><em>St Albans, Hertfordshire</em></p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Join the debate \u2013 email </em></strong><strong><em><a href=\"mailto:guardian.letters@theguardian.com\">guardian.letters@theguardian.com</a></em></strong></p> <p>\u2022 The first letter above was amended on 16 September 2016.

  "<p>Earlier this summer, I found myself in the middle of a lively debate because of my work on climate change and the ethics of having children.</p> <p>NPR correspondent Jennifer Ludden profiled some of my work in procreative ethics with an article entitled, \u201c<a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2016/08/18/479349760/should-we-be-having-kids-in-the-age-of-climate-change\">Should we be having kids in the age of climate change?</a>,\u201d which summarized my published views that we ought to consider adopting a \u201c<a href=\"http://www.springer.com/us/book/9783319338699\">small family ethic</a>\u201d and even pursuing <a href=\"https://www.academia.edu/19933914/Population_Engineering_and_the_Fight_against_Climate_Change\">fertility reduction efforts</a> in response to the threat from climate change. Although environmentalists for decades have worried about overpopulation for many good reasons, I suggest the fast-upcoming thresholds in climate change provide uniquely powerful reasons to consider taking real action to slow population growth.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/apr/02/does-climate-change-make-it-immoral-to-have-kids\">Does climate change make it immoral to have kids? | Dave Bry</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Clearly, this idea struck a nerve: I was overwhelmed by the response in my personal email inbox as well as op-eds in other media outlets and over 70,000 shares on Facebook. I am gratified that so many people took the time to read and reflect on the piece.</p> <p>Having read and digested that discussion, I want to continue it by responding to some of the most vocal criticisms of my own work, which includes research on \u201c<a href=\"http://philpapers.org/rec/HICPEA\">population engineering</a>\u201d \u2013 the intentional manipulation of human population size and structure \u2013 I\u2019ve done with my colleagues, Jake Earl and Colin Hickey.</p> <p>In short, the varied arguments against my views \u2013 that I\u2019m overreacting, that the economy will tank and others \u2013 haven\u2019t changed my conviction that we need to discuss the ethics of having children in this era of climate change.</p> <p>Some comments \u2013 those claiming climate change is a hoax, devised by those who wish to control the world\u2019s resources \u2013 are not worth responding to. Since <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/consensus-confirmed-over-90-of-climate-scientists-believe-were-causing-global-warming-57654\">97% of all relevant experts</a> cannot convince climate change skeptics of the basic scientific facts, then nothing I say will change their minds.</p> <p>Other concerns, however, do require a response. Many people reacted to my work on procreation ethics by saying climate change will not be so bad, and so curbing individual desires, such as having children, in its name is unnecessary fear-mongering.</p> <p>In my work, I suggest that 1.5-2 degrees Celsius warming over preindustrial levels will be \u201cdangerous\u201d and \u201cvery bad\u201d, while 4 degrees C will be \u201ccatastrophic\u201d and will leave large segments of the Earth \u201clargely uninhabitable by humans\u201d. Here is a very brief survey of the evidence for those claims based on what I consider reputable sources.</p> <p>At <a href=\"http://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/climatechange/publication/turn-down-the-heat\">1.5-2 degrees C</a>, a World Bank report predicts an increase in extreme weather events, deadly heat waves and severe water stress. Food production will decrease, and changing disease vectors will create unpredictable infectious disease outbreaks. Sea levels will rise, combining with increased storm severity to place coastal cities at risk. The World Health Organization (WHO) <a href=\"http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs266/en/\">estimates</a> that from the years 2030-2050 \u2013 as we reach this level of warming \u2013 at least 250,000 people will die every year from just some of the climate-related harms.</p> <p>Perhaps many of us in rich countries (the \u201cus\u201d who might be reading this) will be largely protected from these early harms; but that doesn\u2019t make them less real to the vulnerable citizens of, say, <a href=\"https://maplecroft.com/portfolio/new-analysis/2013/10/30/31-global-economic-output-forecast-face-high-or-extreme-climate-change-risks-2025-maplecroft-risk-atlas/\">Bangladesh</a>, <a href=\"http://www.ipcc.ch/ipccreports/tar/wg2/index.php?idp=671\">Kiribati or the Maldives</a>. In fact, it <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/the-ethics-of-climate-change-what-we-owe-people-and-the-rest-of-the-planet-51785\">escalates the injustice</a>, as the global wealthy have benefited from and contributed to climate change the most, while the global poor will be hurt first and worst.</p> <p>At <a href=\"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/865571468149107611/pdf/NonAsciiFileName0.pdf\">4 degrees C warming</a>, the World Bank predicts that every summer month will be hotter than any current record heat wave, making the Middle East, North Africa and the Mediterranean deadly during the summer months. Many coastal cities will be completely under water, and all low-lying island nations will likely have to be abandoned. Hundreds of millions, if not billions of people could become <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/how-should-we-compensate-poor-countries-for-loss-and-damage-from-climate-change-55612\">climate refugees</a>, as their homelands become uninhabitable.</p> <p>Based on these descriptions, I stand by my predictions.</p> <p>Other critics have argued that advocating for a lower birth rate equals <a href=\"http://thefederalist.com/2016/08/24/baby-haters-use-global-warming-to-justify-their-selfishness/\">hating babies</a> or being \u201c<a href=\"http://illinoisreview.typepad.com/illinoisreview/2016/08/horwitz-make-babies-and-dont-let-the-greens-guilt-trip-you-about-it.html\">anti-life</a>\u201d.</p> <p>Obviously I don\u2019t hate babies! I\u2019m pretty wild about my own kid, and small humans in general.</p> <p>This anti-life charge is more interesting, but equally wrong. The premise seems to be that those who wish to lower fertility rates must be misanthropic, or fail to see the value of humans. But that gets things exactly backward: a radical concern for climate change is precisely motivated by a concern for human life \u2013 in particular, the human lives that will be affected by climate disruptions.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/07/oceans-heating-big-problem-blue-planet-iucn-report\">The oceans are heating up. That's a big problem on a blue planet | Bill McKibben</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A valuable philosophical contribution here is <a href=\"https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/13064981/Frick_gsas.harvard.inactive_0084L_11842.pdf?sequence=1\">the distinction between \u201cmaking people happy\u201d and \u201cmaking happy people\u201d</a>. When I feed a hungry person, or prevent a harm from befalling someone, I improve a person\u2019s well-being. But when I create a person whom I will then feed and prevent from harm, I make a person who will predictably be well off. In the first case, I added happiness to the world by helping an existing person; whereas in the second case, I added happiness by creating a person who will be happy. See the difference?</p> <p>I, like many philosophers, believe that it\u2019s morally better to make people happy than to make happy people. Those who exist already have needs and wants, and protecting and providing for them is motivated by respect for human life. It is not a harm to someone not to be created.</p> <p>In fact, I would argue that it is more \u201canti-life\u201d to prioritize creating new life over caring for, or even not harming, those who already exist.</p> <p>Another opposing argument: people are not only consumers \u2013 they are also <a href=\"https://www.bostonglobe.com/opinion/2016/08/23/rising-population-makes-world-better-not-worse/d7TvIfu8L9F1LTv2yxYhfI/story.html\">producers</a>, and so will make the world better.</p> <p>Yes, humans are producers, and many wonderful things have come from human genius. But each person, whatever else they are (genius or dunce, producer or drag on the economy) is also a consumer. And this is the only claim needed in order to be worried about climate change.</p> <p>The problem here is that we have a finite resource \u2013 the ability of the Earth\u2019s atmosphere to absorb greenhouse gases without violently disrupting the climate \u2013 and each additional person contributes to the total amount of greenhouse gas in the atmosphere. So although humans will hopefully save us (we do, in fact, desperately need brilliant people to develop scaleable technology to remove carbon from the air, for instance), the solution to this cannot be to have as many babies as possible, with the hope that this raises our probability of solving the problem. Because each baby is also an emitter, whether a genius or not.</p> <p>Lastly, there\u2019s the view that lowering fertility rates <a href=\"http://thefederalist.com/2016/08/23/have-lots-of-children-its-good-for-the-planet/\">will kill the economy</a>.</p> <p>Several commenters point to low-fertility countries such as Japan, Italy and Germany, and argue that problems experienced by such countries are proof that the \u201creal\u201d population crisis is our dropping fertility rate. We need more babies to grow into healthy young producers to keep our economic engine humming.</p> <p>The truth in this objection is the following: an economy that requires infinite growth to be healthy will be harmed in a world of finite resources. But if it\u2019s true that our economies can\u2019t survive slowing or even reversing population growth, then we\u2019re in some trouble no matter what.</p> <p>Why? It\u2019s simple logic that we cannot grow our population forever. We can either reflect now on how to protect our economy while working toward a sustainable population, or we can ignore the problem until nature forces it on us, perhaps violently and unexpectedly.</p> <p>I\u2019ll conclude with one, final thought: I don\u2019t enjoy arguing for a small family ethic, or a population engineering scheme. Despite snide accusations to the contrary, I get no research funds or any other incentive for making this case. I\u2019m arguing these points because I\u2019m genuinely worried about the future of our planet, and the people who will inherit it, and I believe difficult yet civil discussion is the crucial first step to making that future one we won\u2019t be condemned for creating.</p> <p><em>This piece was originally published in The Conversation.</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"img tag\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://counter.theconversation.edu.au/content/65014/count.gif&quot; alt=&quot;The Conversation&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>",
  "<p>Almost three years ago I was asked by Durham constabulary to advise on detention centre regimes as background to an investigation of allegations of abuse at HM detention centre Medomsley. Its work was later taken over by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/12/child-sex-abuse-inquiry-uk-scale-catastrophe\" title=\"\">independent inquiry into child sexual abuse</a>. Now we learn (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/sep/08/hundreds-of-alleged-abuse-victims-threaten-to-boycott-jay-inquiry\" title=\"\">Victims threatening boycott of child abuse inquiry</a>, 9 September) that the inquiry\u2019s terms of reference preclude them from hearing evidence from those who were 18 or over at the time, though it will consider behaviour commencing before the age of 18.</p> <p>Until 1970 the age of majority in the UK was set at 21. Medomsley was classified as a senior detention centre and thus held those between the ages of 17 and 21, all of them children as the law then stood. Medomsley opened in 1961, so the inquiry\u2019s terms of reference will preclude about nine years\u2019 worth of serious allegations, except for those made by a few former trainees at the very lowest end of the age scale.</p> <p>A Durham team was sensitively handling very many serious allegations and had worked hard to gain the confidence of former trainees. Now, three years on, the latter are to be given a metaphorical slap in the face. The inquiry\u2019s terms of reference should be amended so as to avoid inflicting another form of abuse upon those traumatised individuals who seemingly misplaced their trust in the system by coming forward in the first place.<br><strong>Peter Quinn</strong><br><em>(Former prison governor)</em><br><em>Helperby, North Yorkshire</em></p> <p>\u2022 Lowell Goddard makes a plea for the independent inquiry into sex abuse to focus on the future protection of children vulnerable to abuse, while Eric Allison and Simon Hattenstone argue passionately for those previously abused while in the care of the state to be heard. While it may be that such unchecked, terrible abuse in a state institution is a thing of the past, the attitude to the \u201cbad\u201d boys and girls in our custodial institutions has changed little over the years.</p> <p>Where was the public outrage following the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b06ymzly\" title=\"\">Panorama programme</a> earlier this year about the treatment of children in a secure training centre? And why, despite a change in management and reassurances from government, did the recent inspection report on the same centre still express grave concerns? Children in custody, whatever crime they have committed, are in the care of the state, and the state has a duty to treat them with respect; it is only a small step from lack of care and respect to actual abuse. The lack of concern for and interest in these children may create a climate where such abuse is not only a thing of history.<br><strong>Pam Hibbert</strong><br><em>Llangammarch Wells, Powys</em></p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Join the debate \u2013 email </em></strong><a href=\"mailto:guardian.letters@theguardian.com\" title=\"\"><strong><em>guardian.letters@theguardian.com</em></strong></a></p>",
  "<p>Government minister Liam Fox sparked derision over the weekend by saying British businesses were too \u201clazy and fat\u201d to export. The secretary of state for international trade also suggested that the lure of \u201cgolf on a Friday afternoon\u201d was preventing more deals from happening. Fox, a keen advocate of Britain\u2019s decision to leave the EU, also questioned whether business leaders <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/09/fat-and-lazy-britain-is-ill-prepared-to-secure-future-outside-eu-says-fox\">would be able to take advantage of the trade deals</a> his department were planning.<br></p> <p>Exporting entrepreneurs were uniformly unimpressed by Fox\u2019s comments and many contacted the Guardian to express their outrage. Among them was Steve Magnall, CEO of St Peter\u2019s Brewery in Suffolk, which exports to over 40 countries with 50% of its sales being made overseas. \u201cWhen I heard the quote from Liam Fox I was so angry. None of our export success has come from government support, it\u2019s all been achieved through hard work and perseverance,\u201d Magnall said. \u201cPerhaps Dr Fox should spend a day with us as we cold call, chase importers, organise samples, send over presentations, Skype call and much more. I wish I had time to play golf on a Friday afternoon, but unfortunately I am too busy chasing sales.\u201d</p> <p>Joy Parkinson, managing director of beauty products company Faith in Nature which exports to 38 countries, also dismissed Fox\u2019s comments. \u201cDr Fox\u2019s comments are not at all helpful. To say that the UK\u2019s entrepreneurs aren\u2019t doing everything they can to make Brexit a success is insulting to the country\u2019s SMEs,\u201d she said. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Perhaps Dr Fox should spend a day with us</p> <footer> <cite>Steve Magnall, CEO of St Peter\u2019s Brewery</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>She also pointed to the sacrifices made by her own staff in pursuit of overseas trade and says she and her team regularly spend time away from their families as a result. \u201cTwo weeks ago our sales director returned from his honeymoon, dropped his cases and new wife at home and within 24 hours was on a flight to Orlando for a 30 minute meeting with one of the largest supermarket chains in the US,\u201d she said.<br></p> <p>But Fox\u2019s comments reflect government anxiety over a lack of international trade, which has been put under the spotlight following the vote to leave the EU. The UK\u2019s trade deficit, the gap between the value of the country\u2019s imports compared to our exports, is substantial \u2013 <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/feb/09/uk-trade-deficit-widens-further-imports-exports\">hitting a record high of \u00a3125bn in 2015</a>. Indeed, the UK has run a trade deficit since the late 1990s although economists tend to point to factors such as increased consumer spending, a decline in manufacturing, the strength of sterling and a fall in oil and gas production, rather than the waistlines of business leaders. </p> <p>The UK economy is heavily dependent on services, which are harder to export than manufactured goods. Also, the vast majority of its 5.4m businesses are SMEs and most of those are micro-businesses, which are less likely to be able export than bigger businesses. But ambitious entrepreneurs are not short of ideas on how more growth and exports could be achieved. Although being castigated by government ministers is not one of them. </p> <p>Christopher Greenough, a director of Shropshire-based metal press and assembly supplier Salop Design and Engineering Ltd, says his company has successfully grown its exports across Europe and the US over the past few years and now account for 15% of turnover. He says his company has benefited from the help of the UK trade &amp; investment department (UKTI), the government foreign trade arm, but feels its efforts could be more streamlined. <br tabindex=\"-1\"><br tabindex=\"-1\">\u201cThe government could make it easier for SMEs to start exporting, or indeed increase exports, by making the route to information easier. There is good information within the UKTI, but this information needs to have a clear route to business leaders. Dr Fox may think that business leaders do nothing but play golf and socialise, but what we actually do is work very hard and we do not have as much time as is sometimes necessary to find information and services,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Greenough also took issue with the idea that business leaders aren\u2019t serious about business growth and driving exports. \u201cWe work tirelessly, to promote UK manufacturing and engage with the next generation to show that there are great opportunities within the sector for long term careers.\u201d </p> <p>There is concern that government cuts may also be undermining growth and exports. Earlier this year the government <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/small-business-network/2015/nov/30/entrepreneurs-furious-as-chancellor-abolishes-business-growth-service\">shut down the Business Growth Service</a>, which included the much respected Manufacturing Advisory Service. UKTI has seen its funding cut and the government is keen for the private sector to run more trade missions. The government also wants Innovate UK <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/small-business-network/2016/feb/15/are-conservatives-losing-small-business-vote\">to provide fewer grants</a> and more loans to businesses. HMRC also has less resources to promote information about complex tax rules and changes that often hamper exporting entrepreneurs. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/12/golf-businessman-liam-fox-lazy-brexit\">I\u2019m a golf-playing businessman, Liam Fox. We\u2019re definitely not lazy | John Merriam</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But some entrepreneurs say the government has failed to ensure that EU VAT rules are fair and practical. Businesses that sell digital products such as ebooks, online courses and MP3s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/small-business-network/2015/sep/14/eu-propose-vat-exemption-small-businesses-protests\">have been hit by EU rules</a> that mean VAT is now charged in the country where the products are bought, rather than the country where the seller is located. Clare Josa, co-founder of EU VAT Action, says that only businesses that can afford expensive software can cope with such regulations and she and 10,000 micro businesses are calling for urgent reform. \u201cWe\u2019re not fat or lazy and we were doing a brilliant job of exporting, until the EU Digital VAT changes, which were passed into law by the British parliament,\u201d Josa says. </p> <p>Josa says the government \u201crefused to ask the EU for an interim threshold\u201d, which would have precluded small businesses from the changes. Josa also says reform of the law could take years and business is on hold until then. \u201cLegislation is due to be proposed by the European commission in December, to allow for a small business threshold, but it could still take four or more years to debate. And, no, Brexit doesn\u2019t change it. These rules apply whether or not we\u2019re in the EU,\u201d Josa says.</p> <p>But there is some hope that fresh trade deals could give manufacturers and exporters a boost. Mike Cherry, chair of the Federation of Small Businesses, says that small businesses are delivering export-driven growth. \u201cOur latest data shows that UK small exporters grew in the last quarter.

  "<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/sep/12/can-you-solve-it-four-bookish-brainteasers\">Earlier today I set you these four questions</a>:</p> <p>1) <em>Volumes I, II and III of a dictionary are stacked vertically side by side on a shelf, in that order and with spines visible in the normal way. The thickness of the pages in each volume is 6cm, and the thickness of the cover of each volume is 5mm.</em></p> <p><em>What is the horizontal distance from the first page of Volume I to the final page of Volume III?</em></p> <p><strong>Solution:</strong> 8cm</p> <p>Now this is embarrassing - only 25.06 per cent of you got this one right! More than half \u2013 54.68 per cent \u2013 said 20cm. And you may have worked out why you made the mistake as soon as you saw the answer.</p> <p>When books are stacked in volumes, the first page of each volume ends up on the right side (as you face the shelf) and the last page is on the left side. So to get from the first page of Vol 1 to the last page of Vol 3, you need to count only the thickness of the (front) cover of Vol 1, the (back) cover of Vol 2, the pages of Vol 2, the (front) cover of Vol 2 and the (back) cover of Vol 3. Which is 5mm + 5mm + 6cm + 5mm + 5mm = 8cm</p> <p>2) <em>Count upwards from ZERO thinking about the letters used in the names of numbers. The letter F appears for the first time in <strong>F</strong>OUR. The letter A first appears in ONE HUNDRED <strong>A</strong>ND ONE.</em></p> <p><em>Keep on counting, noting the first appearance of each letter in the names of numbers. What is the final letter that you will note down? In other words, when counting upwards, what is the final letter to appear in the name of a number?</em></p> <p><strong>Solution</strong>: C</p> <p>By the time we get to 101, we have used 19 letters of the alphabet - leaving B, C, J, K, M, P and Q. Lets tick them off:</p> <p><strong>M</strong>ILLION, <strong>B</strong>ILLION, <strong>Q</strong>UADRILLION, SE<strong>P</strong>TILLION, O<strong>C</strong>TILLION</p> <p>So C is the last one to appear. J and K never appear in the name of any number. (Kazillion doesn\u2019t count).</p> <p>Again, most people got this one wrong. Your favourite choice was Q, with 22.74 per cent, then C (19.72), B (19.44), J (11.95), P (7.65), Y (6.76), M (5.23), K (4.23), and D (2.29).</p> <p>3) The following statement is correct</p> <blockquote> <p><em>&lt; F is the first and the seventh letter of this sentence.&gt;</em></p> </blockquote> <p>Using the sentence above as a model, fill in the gap in the following sentence to make it correct:</p> <blockquote> <p><em>&lt;C is the first and the [...] letter of this sentence.&gt;</em></p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Solution: </strong></p> <p>C is the first and the <strong>forty-sixth</strong> letter of this sentence.</p> <p>4) Reorganise the letters of READING SLOW to form a single word.</p> <p><strong>Solution:</strong></p> <p>A SINGLE WORD</p> <p>Not really a trick question, but required some lateral thought...

(Hasanbegovic has since emphasised that his current party is anti-fascist.)</p> <p>On Sunday, Croats went to the polls in a snap election, returning the ruling nationalist party HDZ as the biggest party, but changing nothing. Just 53% of all Croats voted: the likely outcome is a coalition of the same old \u201ccentrist\u201d parties \u2013 nationalists and social democrats. On the face of it, the country faces the same old problems. Unemployment at 16%, rising to 40% among the young; debt at 90% of GDP; the coast dependent on tourism, the interior sending migrant workers to Germany and Austria by the coachload.</p> <p>What\u2019s new is the return of nationalism. By 2013, Croatia\u2019s conservative nationalist politicians had made enough liberal noises to convince Brussels they could meet the basic criteria for EU membership. Since then, they\u2019ve been sucked into the surge of nationalist rivalry that\u2019s gripped the Balkans. Just across the mountains lies Republika Srpska \u2013 the Serb enclave created in the country of Bosnia and Herzegovina by the Dayton Agreement in 1995, after a bitter civil war. Republika Srpska\u2019s leaders are threatening to hold a referendum on independence, which would blow up the deal that has brought peace to the region for 20 years.</p> <p>In response, Croatia\u2019s politicians have upped the rhetoric, with the leader of its centre-left party secretly recorded threatening to \u201cact to protect Croats\u201d if the referendum goes ahead, labelling Bosnia a \u201cfailed state\u201d and calling the government of Serbia \u201cmiserable people\u201d.</p> <p>If this were just a recrudescence of the Balkan ethnic conflict of the 1990s, it would be bad enough. But it comes on top of years of economic failure, amid growing geopolitical tension, and rising xenophobia in the face of the refugee crisis.</p> <p>Russian money has poured not just into Serbia but into Republika Srpska, too, together with increased diplomatic influence. Meanwhile, Croatia has joined the EU. As a result, the Balkans today have become a more clearly diplomatic and systemic frontline than they were in 1995, when the wars ended. The assumption that globalisation, economic growth and time would heal the region is looking more uncertain than at any point since the peace deal.</p> <p>If the Serbs of Bosnia were to go for their independence referendum, and Putin were to back them, the Kremlin would have a new pawn in the same game it is playing with the west in Syria, Ukraine and the Baltic States.</p> <p>Amid this, the intellectual life of the Balkans has retreated to a set of parallel compartments. There is the globalist left, applauding the partisan veterans in the squares, but insignificant in mainstream politics. There is the far right, whose main achievement in Croatia this year was to erect a statue to a convicted ethnic terrorist from the 1970s.</p> <p>Many people in their 40s and 50s live a post-traumatic lifestyle: getting on with business, family or early retirement, rarely speaking about what they did, or suffered, but gripped by an innate concern that the conflict might come back.</p> <p>Meanwhile, young people across the region try to live in a cannabis-softened, networked dreamworld \u2013 where electronic dance music or Pok\u00e9mon Go replace the national and political identities formed 20 years ago.</p> <p>If Europe wants to make the Balkans work, it needs to understand the limits of its current approach. It has lowered accession standards for countries in east and southeast Europe, in order to bring them into its enlargement project.</p> <p>Albania got candidate status in 2014. Bosnia submitted its application in February this year. Macedonia, which gained brownie points in Brussels for erecting a fence on the Greek border last year, is so mired in ethnic violence and rampant corruption that EU membership is impossible. Yet there are loud voices calling for its admission.</p> <p>The region\u2019s politicians, be they corrupt, chauvinist or simply incompetent, know that by ticking a few boxes on an EU checklist they can advance the process of accession with only paper reforms. The fact that many of the region\u2019s progressives, above all the young, yearn for EU membership is one more incentive for Brussels to look the other way.</p> <p>If the EU is to live up to the hope and trust placed in it by young people in the Balkans, it needs to start by being firm with the incoming Croatian government. All cultural nods and winks towards the fascist regime in the second world war must go. Ultimately, the EU must be prepared \u2013 as it has threatened with Poland and Hungary but not done \u2013 to trigger the Article 7 processes that can see member countries warned over inadequate rule of law, and ultimately be suspended from membership, or see their voting rights curtailed.</p> <p>The EU\u2019s leaders lost no time after Brexit in reigniting the common defence and security policy process \u2013 what the Daily Mail calls the \u201cEuropean Army\u201d. They are right to do so \u2013 for if the Balkans goes wrong again, Croatia as an EU member would have the right to call for support under the mutual defence clause of the Lisbon treaty, and all EU members would have the obligation to support it. But in the short term, what is vital is for western European democracies to engage with the Balkans and promote democratic culture and institutions. It was, ultimately, US diplomacy that imposed the peace of 1995. Today it is squarely the EU\u2019s task to maintain it.</p>",

  "<p>My colleague and friend Kay Everett, who has died of cancer aged 43, was a gifted lawyer whose campaigning work in immigration and human rights issues made her a powerful voice for the voiceless.

Brian\u2019s work meant the family lived abroad for periods, and Kay took an international baccalaureate at the United World College of South East Asia in Singapore before reading law and Chinese at the University of Leeds.</p> <p>Following graduation in 1995, Kay trained at the City firm Lovells, where she met her partner, Anand Doobay, then joined the magic circle firm <a href=\"http://www.freshfields.com/en/global/\" title=\"\">Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer</a>, working in project finance, in 2000.</p> <p>It was at a meeting at the Ministry of Defence that Kay realised the City was not for her.

Thereafter she volunteered at <a href=\"http://www.hclc.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Hackney Law Centre</a> and became active in supporting destitute asylum seekers and migrants, reshaping her career as an immigration and legal aid specialist.</p> <p>Kay joined Wilson Solicitors in 2008, where I first worked with her. She had a wonderful sense of humour and her optimistic catchphrase \u201cwhat can possibly go wrong?\u201d punctuated the most tense legal dramas involving emergency removals and complex detention cases. She was a passionate fighter for the most vulnerable of clients, winning their trust, and giving them a place of safety.</p> <p>She helped to establish the public law department at Wilsons, and we were proud to appoint her a partner. Her kindness and intellectual rigour underpinned outstanding legal work. Kay was a wise mentor, helping numerous trainee solicitors with their careers.</p> <p>Over the years Kay campaigned on immigration and human rights issues. She gave moving evidence about the inordinate immigration detention in the UK to the <a href=\"http://www.appgmigration.org.uk/\" title=\"\">all-party parliamentary group on migration</a>.

Earlier this month, when the unwritten dress codes of the City of London <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/sep/01/top-graduates-missing-out-on-banking-jobs-for-lacking-polish\">were revealed </a>(no brown shoes or ill-fitting suits and ties), they felt as if they existed in a different era. Indeed, the concept of the dress code has never felt more archaic and strange. </p> <p>Partly, this is because both athleisure and, to a lesser extent, the utilitarian trend have absolutely altered the way we look at clothes. The idea of what is considered high fashion or \u201cappropriate dressing\u201d has been collapsed by the incorporation of elements such as the hoodie, the slider, the work shirt and the tracksuit jogger into <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/mar/25/take-the-money-and-run-the-rise-of-the-1000-tracksuit\">catwalk collections</a>.

  "<p>The safe house address of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/sep/04/mary-shipstone-seven-shot-dead-by-father-doorstep-northiam-inquest-hears\">seven-year-old girl murdered by her estranged father </a>was accidentally sent to him by her mother\u2019s solicitor, a serious case review has revealed. </p> <p>Mary Shipstone was returning to the house from school with her mother when Yasser Alromisse shot her in the head on the doorstep before fatally shooting himself.<br></p> <p>The review revealed that five months earlier <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/sep/15/mother-girl-father-police-northiam-shipstone\">Lyndsey Shipstone</a>, who had fled with her daughter to escape domestic abuse and violence, reported to police that her solicitor had inadvertently disclosed their new address to Alromisse in legal papers.</p> <p>There was also evidence or strong suspicion that details of their previous addresses or identities were inadvertently given to 46-year-old Alromisse by other bodies, including a bank and the Child Support Agency.<br></p> <p>However, the serious case review concluded that no one could have predicted or prevented the killing, which took place in Northiam, near Rye, East Sussex, on 11 September 2014. <br></p> <p>It said there was no evidence Alromisse located his daughter and estranged wife through the disclosures.<br></p> <p>It was not certain whether he had received the information about the new address as he had moved house, or whether he noticed it in the correspondence, the review said. For some time after this incident he tried a variety of clandestine methods to find out his daughter\u2019s exact address and establish her routine.<br></p> <p>The criminal investigation into the girl\u2019s shooting found that Alromisse had used \u201ca variety of covert and illicit means\u201d to try to trace Mary, referred to as Child P in the report.<br></p> <p>The review identified that \u201cgiven the existence of social media and very powerful internet search engines, it is increasingly difficult for families fleeing violence to rely on their whereabouts remaining secret\u201d. It called for assurances from agencies that systems were in place surrounding information about vulnerable people that should not be revealed.<br></p> <p>\u201cIt has not been possible to establish exactly when and how he [Alromisse] found out where Child P was living,\u201d the 73-page report noted. \u201cThere is no evidence that any professional was aware of this activity, nor did he make any threat to harm Child P or give any indication that he might do so.</p> <p>\u201cThe review has concluded that no professional working with the family could have prevented him acting as he did.\u201d</p> <p>The report also said Mary\u2019s death was a \u201cspite killing\u201d that \u201cwas calculated to deprive the mother of her child while at the same time leaving her with a permanent memory of her death\u201d.<br></p> <p>Shipstone believed Alromisse killed their daughter because he feared the outcome of a new round of court hearings would end in him being denied contact, it added.<br></p> <p>At an inquest last year, the East Sussex coroner Alan Craze said the \u201cthoroughly despicable act of violence\u201d had been \u201cpremeditated over a long period of time\u201d. It heard Mary\u2019s mother had carried her to neighbour\u2019s house where they tried to revive the girl while waiting for emergency services. She was taken to King\u2019s College hospital, London, but later died of her injuries.<br></p> <p>A spokesman for East Sussex local safeguarding children board (LSCB) said it was a \u201ctragic case\u201d .<br></p> <p>\u201cAfter a thorough independent review, the LSCB concluded, as did the investigating police officers, that the father planned and carried out the killing in a secretive way, using the internet and a range of covert methods to trace the family and obtain the means to carry out the murder,\u201d the spokesman said. </p> <p>\u201cThere is no evidence that any professional involved with the family prior to these tragic events was aware of this activity. Based on the review, the LSCB concludes that no professional could have prevented him doing what he did.\u201d<br></p> <p>He added: \u201cIt is certainly true that on a couple of occasions information was inadvertently given to the father by a few organisations which might have revealed the whereabouts of the mother and the child.<br></p> <p> \u201cHowever, as we have detailed in the report, there is no evidence this information did actually allow him to track them down. In fact, it was a period of some six months after details had been disclosed to him before the mother raised concern, and in that time there is evidence the father had still been using the internet to try to trace them.</p> <p> \u201cWhat this has highlighted, however, and what we want all agencies to be mindful of, is that social media and powerful internet search engines make it increasingly difficult for families fleeing violence to rely on their whereabouts remaining secret. This needs to be considered as part of safety planning and guidance given to those at risk.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Asthma and allergies in children could be prevented by altering the type of microbes inside their gut as babies, researchers have suggested.</p> <p>The team found that a particular pattern of gut microbes in babies just a month old was linked to an increased risk of them developing asthma and allergic reactions as they grew up.</p> <p>\u201cEarly-life intervention may be a strategy by which we can offset allergic asthma in perhaps a portion of the population,\u201d said Susan Lynch, co-author of the research from the University of California, San Francisco, adding that such interventions could include supplementing young babies with a cocktail of bacteria and other microbes lacking in their gut.</p> <p>According to Asthma UK, the UK has one of the highest rates of asthma symptoms in children in the world, with one in 11 currently receiving treatment for the condition. While the disease can be managed, there is currently no cure.</p> <p>Writing in the journal <a href=\"http://nature.com/articles/doi:10.1038/nm.4176\">Nature Medicine</a>, Lynch and colleagues describe how they analysed the gut microbes of 130 babies aged around one month old by examining their stool samples. They then followed up on the health of the children at two and four years of age.</p> <p>Microbes such as bacteria and fungi are passed from mothers to babies during birth, while breastfeeding, the surrounding environment and the use of antibiotics are also thought to influence the mix.</p> <p>The researchers found that the babies fell broadly into one of three groups, based on the mix of microbes living in their gut. </p> <p>One of the groups, composed of 11 babies, were three times more likely to have allergic reactions at two years and asthma at four years old compared to the other groups.</p> <p>The stools of these babies, Lynch added, had low levels of bacteria including <em>Faecalibacterium</em> and <em>Bifidobacterium</em> and high levels of fungi such as <em>Candida </em>and <em>Rhodotorula</em>. That raises the possibility of manipulating the mix of gut microbes early in development to reduce the risk.</p> <p>To unpick how the microbes could affect the likelihood of developing allergies and asthma, Lynch and colleagues exposed immune cells from healthy adults to sterilised stool samples from the lowest and highest-risk babies. The upshot was that samples from the high-risk babies triggered an immune response and suppressed cells involved in keeping allergic responses in check.</p> <p>That, says Lynch, \u201c[suggests] that the microbes in the gut and their products in these highest-risk children drives an allergic response from very early infancy\u201d.</p> <p>The researchers also delved into possible explanations for why some babies had the problematic set of gut microbes, finding that those children were more likely to be boys and to grow up in a household without a dog.</p> <p>Benjamin Marsland, an expert on the impact of microbes on the immune system from the University hospital of Lausanne in Switzerland, described the new research as \u201cimportant\u201d. </p> <p>\u201cThere is a growing awareness that events very early in life can shape how our immune system matures, and as a consequence, our susceptibility to, or protection against, allergies,\u201d he said. </p> <p>The new research, he adds, is a stepping stone towards new ways of tackling asthma and allergies. \u201cIf we can ensure that a baby is exposed to the right microbes early in life, we might be able to reduce the global burden of allergic diseases, such as asthma,\u201d he said.</p> <p>But William Cookson, professor of genomic medicine at Imperial College London, urged caution, noting the small number of children considered to have asthma or allergy in the study and that an increase in allergic reactions at two years of age was not found using conventional definitions.</p> <p>\u201cAsthma is a disease of the airways, it is not a disease of the bowel, and the airways have their own microbiota \u2013 fungi and bacteria \u2013 which are very, very plainly abnormal in asthmatics,\u201d he added. \u201cSo the more logical thing to do, to me, is to look at the lungs, rather than to look at the bowels.\u201d</p> <p>Dr Erika Kennington, head of research at Asthma UK, said: \u201cWe know that gut bacteria can influence our health in many different ways, including determining our risk of developing asthma, but we don\u2019t yet know exactly how this process works.</p> <p>\u201cThis new research helps us better understand the link between gut bacteria and asthma in young children and, in the future, could potentially help us to identify youngsters at higher risk of developing asthma and develop treatments to help them manage it.\u201d</p> <p>Lynch adds that early life gut bacteria are not likely to be the whole story. \u201cMy personal view is that there are many ways to develop the disease,\u201d she said.</p>",

Either way I'm glad Wetherspoons has generously taken the risk of trialing this and making this amazing discovery never known by any business before.</p></div> </div> </div>  </figure>  <h2>\u2018For people like my grandson, the flexibility is ideal\u2019<br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-comment\" data-canonical-url=\"https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/83080853\">  <div class=\"d2-comment-embedded\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Comment\"> <div class=\"d2-left-col\"> <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/2328382\" title=\"View silverthread\u2019s profile\"> <img class=\"d2-avatar\" src=\"https://avatar.guim.co.uk/user/2328382\" height=\"40\" width=\"40\" alt=\"User avatar for silverthread\"> </a> </div> <div class=\"d2-right-col\"> <div itemscope itemprop=\"author\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"> <a class=\"d2-username\" href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/2328382\" title=\"View silverthread\u2019s profile\" itemprop=\"url\"> <span itemprop=\"givenName\">silverthread</span> </a> </div> <div class=\"d2-permalink\"> <a class=\"d2-datetime\" href=\"https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/83080853\" title=\"Link to this comment\" itemprop=\"datePublished\">12 September 2016 11:28am</a> </div> <div class=\"d2-body\" itemprop=\"text\"><p>My grandson works at 'Spoons, pot washing and helping out in the kitchen with food preparation and loves it.He was unemployed for quite a few years after leaving school.

How can you walk out on a job that has no hours?

  "<p>One of Bravo\u2019s mis-controls forced the Chilean to lunge at Rooney to clear the ball. Jos\u00e9 Mourinho, United\u2019s manager, later claimed the challenge should have led to a penalty but Guardiola would not be drawn on the incident. \u201cNormally in my career \u2013 or maybe only once or twice in seven years \u2013 I don\u2019t speak about the decisions of referees,\u201d said the Catalan. \u201cSometimes you are lucky. Sometimes you are unlucky but I am not going to talk about the decision of referees.</p> <p>Pep Guardiola has claimed Manchester City cannot win the Premier League or the Champions League unless they improve, despite his side starting the season with six consecutive wins.</p> <p>City won the Manchester derby on Saturday to remain the only side in the league with a 100% record and coasted through their Champions League knockout round, defeating Steaua Bucharest 6-0 on aggregate.</p> <p>In all Guardiola\u2019s side have scored 17 goals and, if Sergio Ag\u00fcero had not been suspended on Saturday, victory in the derby may have been more emphatic.</p> <p>Yet, as City were preparing to take on Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach in their opening Champions League group game at the Etihad Stadium on Tuesday night, Guardiola said: \u201cTo take it to the next level we have to improve a lot of things. Now, after four games in the Premier League, I would like to tell our fans that the way we have played up until now, it will not be good enough to win the title. So we have to improve to win the Premier League. Of course, we are so happy with the results and the way we are playing after two months.</p> <p>\u201cBut it is not enough to win the Premier League or the bigger target of the Champions League. We have to improve. But it\u2019s normal. All the teams have to improve, especially for the managers who are new, like United, like us, like Chelsea. When you see Liverpool or Tottenham with [Mauricio] Pochettino, they are clear what they do in 90 minutes.\u201d</p> <p>Guardiola, meanwhile, has admitted that Claudio Bravo is likely to make further mistakes that will allow opponents to score after the new City goalkeeper endured an error-strewn debut in Saturday\u2019s victory over Manchester United.</p> <p>Bravo is expected to retain his place against M\u00f6nchengladbach with Willy Caballero on the bench after Joe Hart was loaned out to the Serie A club Torino for the rest of the season.</p> <p>The Chilean\u2019s biggest mistake against United led to Zlatan Ibrahimovic\u2019s first-half goal at Old Trafford as the 33-year-old dropped a Wayne Rooney free-kick, allowing the Swede to score. City hung on to win 2-1 despite Bravo continuing to be shaky and, at times, suspect when using his feet to control and pass the ball.</p> <p>Yet Guardiola is accepting that the mistake against City will not be Bravo\u2019s last. \u201cWhether it is Claudio Bravo, Caballero or Angus [Gunn, City\u2019s young third-choice keeper], they are going to make mistakes in the future. They are not going to save all the goals from going in,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are going to make mistakes, the opponents are going to score goals.

I was convinced by him before the game and it was the same after.

  "<p>Ameen Jogee, whose retrial at Nottingham crown court became a test of revised \u201cjoint enterprise\u201d laws, has been sentenced to 12 years in prison for the manslaughter of a former police officer.<br></p> <p>His conviction and sentence replace his previous term of 20 years for murder, which the supreme court quashed this year after ruling that judges had repeatedly misinterpreted the law.</p> <p>Jogee was 22 when Paul Fyfe was stabbed to death at the home of his girlfriend in Leicester in June 2011. The prosecution claimed Jogee \u201cegged on\u201d another man, Mohammed Hirsi, to strike the fatal blow against Fyfe, a father of three.<br></p> <p>Jailing him, the judge Gregory Dickinson said: \u201cPaul Fyfe was attacked in his own home. It was unprovoked and totally without justification. The consequences for his family were and remain devastating. <br></p> <p>\u201cThis was not a spur of the moment event. You and Hirsi went to the home \u2026 late at night intending to attack Paul Fyfe and to cause him some harm. You intended to encourage Hirsi to attack Mr Fyfe.\u201d <br></p> <p>Jogee, now 27, has served more than five years in custody, which will count towards his sentence. So-called joint enterprise laws allowed the accomplice to be treated the same as the person who committed the deadly act.</p> <p>In February, however, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2016/feb/18/joint-enterprise-law-wrongly-interpreted-for-30-years-court-rules\">the supreme court ruled</a> that for the past 30 years judges had been misinterpreting a key justification for obtaining convictions, confusing the fact that an outcome might be foreseeable with criminal intent.</p> <p>The supreme court judges ordered Jogee to be retried on murder and manslaughter charges. He denied both charges and was cleared of murder after 13 hours of deliberation, but a jury unanimously convicted him of manslaughter last Monday. </p> <p>During the retrial, the jury heard that Fyfe, 47, was stabbed in the early hours of 10 June 2011 while Jogee stood on the doorstep. William Harbage QC, prosecuting, said Jogee encouraged Hirsi to stab Fyfe. <br></p> <p>The jury heard Jogee and Hirsi were frustrated when they arrived at the home of Naomi Reid, the girlfriend of the victim, after being refused entry into another friend\u2019s house in the early hours of the morning. <br></p> <p>Reid asked the pair to leave before Fyfe returned. They did and she sent a text message to Jogee asking him not to bring Hirsi back to her home, the jury heard. <br></p> <p>The pair later returned to the property, by which time Fyfe had arrived back from work. Hirsi took a knife from the kitchen and grabbed Reid, Fyfe stood between the pair and asked Hirsi: \u201cWhat are you going to do, stab me?\u201d <br></p> <p>Defending Jogee, Felicity Gerry QC said her client was not a murderer and that Fyfe\u2019s death was a \u201csurprise\u201d. She added: \u201cHe was just in the wrong place at the wrong time. He had no idea what was going on in the house.\u201d</p> <p>Gloria Morrison, one of the leading activists in Joint Enterprise: Not Guilty By Association, which campaigned to reform the law, welcomed the the jury\u2019s rejection of the murder conviction. </p> <p>The court of appeal has begun considering a number of test challenges that could have implications for hundreds of prisoners convicted under joint enterprise rules.</p>",

The Observer felt the same way: \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/10/observer-view-on-grammar-schools\">Selection is bad for children, bad for society</a>\u201d.</p> <p>The Times was also unconvinced by May\u2019s plans. It argued that \u201c<a href=\"http://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/selective-memory-j7c7wlbd8\">recreating a top tier of selective grammar schools would be retrograde</a>... divisive and bad for overall standards\u201d.</p> <p>The paper approvingly quoted the one-word response by Sir Michael Wilshaw, the outgoing Ofsted chief, to the argument that a wave of new grammar schools would help working-class children: \u201ctosh\u201d. </p> <p>\u201cShe is an ex-grammar school girl,\u201d said the Times, \u201cbut autobiography in this case would be a poor guide to good policy.\u201d</p> <p>Just so. Consider also the ambivalent views of Sun columnist, and product of a grammar school, Trevor Kavanagh. He recalled the gross unfairness of the education system under which he, and I, grew up:</p> <blockquote> <p>\u201c<a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/1766221/theresa-may-must-pass-this-tough-school-test-in-order-to-give-working-class-children-the-chance-to-shine/\">Many 11-year-olds were scarred for life by a dubious IQ test</a> which sorted us into sheep or goats, successes or failures, stupid or clever...</p> <p>We now realise it is absurd to set a child\u2019s educational trajectory at 11. We develop at different speeds and the classroom door must stay open right up to age 16.\u201d </p> </blockquote> <p>Despite his concern about \u201cschool leavers in England and Scotland lag[ging] behind children from other countries\u201d, he was very cautious about returning to selective education.</p> <p>Acknowledging that \u201cthe issue divides voters as bitterly as Brexit\u201d, he thought May had \u201cto show this revolution, which has taken many in her party by surprise, has been carefully thought through.\u201d</p> <p>Indeed, she does. She needs to take to heart that Times remark about autobiography being \u201ca poor guide to good policy.\u201d I know what that means because I\u2019ve been there.</p> <p>As a former grammar school pupil, my views about its benefits have see-sawed down the years. Initially, in a book I wrote some 10 years after leaving school, I was very critical of the education I received. (I was a convinced enthusiast for the comprehensive system).<br></p> <p>Later, I often found myself revelling in the benefits of going to a grammar, regarding it as an invaluable social mobility mechanism that had helped to propel me up the ladder.</p> <p>I\u2019ve heard any number of grammar school pupils from that era, the late 1950s and early 60s, say the same. And they still say it. </p> <p>It is necessary, however, to put what happened to all of us in perspective because the Britain of that time was very different from the country today, most especially in terms of the economy.</p> <p>We moved into so-called white-collar jobs that were so different from the those of our parents (meaning, incidentally, in most cases, our fathers) because of two key factors: the economy was expanding and, in parallel, manufacturing industry was already beginning to decline.<br></p> <p>Our schooling enabled us to take up a range of occupations crying out for our educational skills. Some went to universities (also growing in number) and then into even better jobs - the law, banking, administration and, of course, teaching.</p> <p>We were, to be frank, lucky. We baby-boomers were in the right place at the right time. Our grammar school was part of the reason for our success, but not even the major part.</p> <p>It did not strike us like that at the time, of course. Nor, going on conversations at past school reunions, does it appear to have struck my contemporaries. </p> <p>We did not simply look back on our schooldays and think them the best days of our lives. We look back and think they are the reason for the lives we have lived since. </p> <p>We have therefore perpetuated a myth about it being the motor behind the insistent call for their return by those who misguidedly believe that the ground-breaking social mobility upheaval of the 1960s can be reproduced a half century later. </p> <p>Part of the grammar school ethos drummed into us was that we were enjoying a privilege because we were part of a relatively small proportion of the population (I recall a teacher saying we were part of a fortunate 11%).</p> <p>What then of the not-so-fortunates? Consigned to secondary moderns, their struggle to find jobs and move up that ladder was made infinitely more difficult. Some did succeed against the odds, just as some grammar school children fell by the wayside.</p> <p>But the overwhelming unfairness, a splitting of the old working class into an educational us-and-them, was evident then and, should Theresa May get her way, will occur all over again.</p> <p>I agree with the prime minister that Britain has developed a form of educational selection by wealth. That is unjust. Creating grammar schools will add to the injustice rather than cure it, and plenty of Conservative MPs know that too.</p> <p>As Tim Ross <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/09/10/cabinet-split-on-grammar-schools-as-theresa-mays-supporters-accu/\">wrote in the Sunday Telegraph</a>, this issue has the capacity to split the Tory party apart. Note the split between the the Times and Sunday Times. Note also the difference between the Sun and Kavanagh. Grammar schools are Brexit part 2.</p>",

Thirteen years ago self-publishing was still called 'vanity publishing' and was pretty much the province of retired sergeant-majors who wanted to write about their saucy escapades in the Far East back in the 50s. That has completely changed now and writers have the possibility of self-publishing into an engaged and receptive audience. </p> <p>I think it's still a trickier solution for literary fiction than genre fiction, certainly for any kind of experimental work and I firmly believe that if I had self-published Girl it would have disappeared without a trace. No one knows better than I how lucky I was or how easily I could still be sitting at home with that book in a drawer and no prospect of that situation ever changing. But I knew it needed a publisher to stand behind it and say they believed in it. I was fortunate enough to find Galley Beggar and, happily for unpublished authors, there are now many indie presses out there who are anxious to turn readers attention to more complex work.

I think Irish writers have engaged with that legacy in lots of different ways over the years. It's true that social realism has been the public face of Irish writing for the last few decades, and 'high' modernism was somewhat prematurely relegated to history by critics who did not know what it could do next, but within that have been other things going on. Dorothy Nelson's In Night's City, written in the 1980s, is a prime example of an incredibly innovative novel that fell foul of fashion and disappeared as a result. A Girl... was just very direct about that influence, even as it was seeking to use those tools to different ends, in a time when no one was looking in that direction, and appeared more surprising as a result.</p></div> </div> </div>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57d69fbfe4b013613fffc745\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-12T12:30:15.977Z\">1.30pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/4094497\">Fourpaws</a> asks:</p> <p><em>Hello Eimear, I\u2019ve just finished reading your latest novel and thought it was brilliant.

Everything happens all at once for me. It took a long time to understand what I was writing about and who I was writing about. What was clear from early on though was that the reader was going to experience the two voices in different ways. They are embedded in the voice and experience of the young girl. They know everything about her and there are no boundaries between the reader and the character. With the older actor, the reader only experiences him through her eyes. They see what she sees and hear what she hears. Their knowledge of him and his internal workings are the same as how we all experience other people in life. Our understanding of him is totally reliant on what he says, how he says it and the way he behaves. For me it was also a game of welding a modernist internal monologue together with the 19th century external monologue and seeing how they influence each other. The dialogue and exposition were all written at the same time though. They are inextricable and complete each other.</p></div> </div> </div>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57d69ec8e4b013613fffc73d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-12T12:26:20.734Z\">1.26pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/3095564\">dumbwit</a> asks:</p> <p><em>What happens when you disagree with an editor\u2019s suggestions?

With TLB, music was hugely important. Not only did it help me key back into the climate of London in the 1990s, it was also listening to a lot of male singer-songwriters which provided inspiration for writing in a male voice. You encounter such a different approach to maleness in song-writing and that was invaluable. For instance the Tindersticks (II) album was the basis for the long male monologue both in terms of ideas and atmosphere. Thanks too to Nick Cave, Brett Anderson, Jarvis Cocker and a host of others. </p> <p>The films of Tarkovsky are a source of inspiration too. His ability to force the viewer's concentration in any direction he wants was very important. I also studied an awful lot of photographs. Wolfgang Tillmans particularly. His earlier work for its human vulnerability and his later work for its challenges to form.</p></div> </div> </div>  </figure>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZnYR8gc6bU\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/nZnYR8gc6bU?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-09-12T12:18:16.056Z\">at 1.18pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57d69b97e4b08465d44ffcfe\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-12T12:12:48.114Z\">1.12pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/4541396\">Porlockhere</a> asks:</p> <p><em>What question(s) are you most hoping people might ask you?</em></p> <p><em>What do you think Freud meant when he said that the Irish are not psychoanalyzible?</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-comment\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/live/2016/sep/08/eimear-mcbride-webchat-the-lesser-bohemians#comment-83089197\">  <div class=\"d2-comment-embedded\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Comment\"> <div class=\"d2-left-col\"> <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/16702896\" title=\"View EimearMcBride\u2019s profile\"> <img class=\"d2-avatar\" src=\"https://avatar.guim.co.uk/user/16702896\" height=\"40\" width=\"40\" alt=\"User avatar for EimearMcBride\"> </a> <span class=\"d2-badge d2-badge-contributor d2-hidetext\" title=\"Guardian contributor\" itemprop=\"jobTitle\">Guardian contributor</span> </div> <div class=\"d2-right-col\"> <div itemscope itemprop=\"author\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"> <a class=\"d2-username\" href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/16702896\" title=\"View EimearMcBride\u2019s profile\" itemprop=\"url\"> <span itemprop=\"givenName\">EimearMcBride</span> </a> </div> <div class=\"d2-permalink\"> <a class=\"d2-datetime\" href=\"https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/83089197\" title=\"Link to this comment\" itemprop=\"datePublished\">12 September 2016 1:12pm</a> </div> <div class=\"d2-body\" itemprop=\"text\"><p>Perhaps: &quot;Do you think the pressure to meet the requirements of the creative writing industry is having a deleterious effect upon our ability to appreciate fiction that is not symmetrical and to speak about literature in an imperfect, non-synthesized way?&quot;</p> <p>As far as I am aware Freud never actually said that but the fact that it is so widely accepted says to me we recognise a grain of truth in it.

Sex itself is, with a few variations, a pretty standard activity: something goes in somewhere until at least one person is happy, so what can be understood from any description of the physical is pretty limited. Where it gets interesting is exploring the who and why of what's going on. Then you're back into the realm of character and that's everything for me.</p> <p>Regarding the transition to female adulthood, it's the great moment of change. The moment when a person stops being reactive and begins to really make the decisions that will shape who they'll become. It's a vulnerable period yet people often don't understand how vulnerable they were until a long time afterwards, which is sort-of captivating. Additionally, girls on the cusp of becoming women are so weighed down with fraudulent \u2013 and frequently damaging \u2013 images and ideas of what a woman should be that they have a whole other layer to cut through before they can get to the truth of themselves and what they want from life.</p></div> </div> </div>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57d6988ae4b013613fffc721\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-12T12:03:00.032Z\">1.03pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Eimear is with us now</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Eimear McBride has started taking on your questions, beginning with this trio from <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/13054981\">Ciaran Quinn</a>:</p> <p><em>How do you manage to write and stop the mundane aspects of life from getting in the way?

  "<p>Dance like nobody is watching, sing like nobody is listening and email like it will be read out in court. Or so Nadine Moawad of the Association for Progressive Communications (APC) joked. Feminist activists from around the world were in a conference room in Brazil, discussing what a feminist internet might look like. How did we get here?</p> <p>The number of prosecutions for violence against women and girls in England and Wales is at record levels. According to a report <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/sep/05/violent-crimes-against-women-in-england-and-wales-reach-record-high\" title=\"\">published by the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) last week</a>, 2015-16 saw a 10% increase on the year before. A rising trend is the use of the internet, social media and other forms of technology to harass, intimidate, humiliate and control women and girls.</p> <p>And this is not just a UK phenomenon. These findings match the results of a study <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/may/25/yvette-cooper-leads-cross-party-campaign-against-online-abuse\" title=\"\">released in May this year</a> that found more than 6,500 individuals had been subjected to 10,000 aggressive and misogynistic tweets over a three-week period in the UK, and 80,000 people had been targeted by 200,000 such tweets internationally.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/sep/05/violent-crimes-against-women-in-england-and-wales-reach-record-high\">Violent crimes against women in England and Wales reach record high</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Although the violence women and girls experience online has received growing attention from the media, politicians and technology companies, what is often missing from conversations is the fact that some women are fighting back. Activists are taking action against online abuse and working towards a feminist internet. When discussing women and the internet, we need to also talk about how feminists are working to reclaim the space.</p> <p>Last week, I attended the 13th international forum organised by the Association for Women\u2019s Rights in Development in Bahia. The <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=AWIDforum&amp;src=typd\" title=\"\">AWIDForum</a> brought together feminist activists from across the world to imagine feminist futures. We spent an entire day working to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/ImagineaFeministInternet?src=hash\" title=\"\">#ImagineAFeministInternet</a> \u2013 and preventing and responding to violence against women and girls was just one part of what this looks like.</p> <p>Sessions were led by the APC. In 2014, the APC brought together activists to develop the <a href=\"http://feministinternet.net/sites/default/files/FeministPrinciplesoftheInternetv2.0_0.pdf\" title=\"\">feminist principles of the internet</a>. They were revised and published in August this year and cover themes of access, movements and public participation, economy, expression and agency. They state that a feminist internet is one where women and LGBT people have affordable and equal access and are able to create, design and use technologies to challenge sexism and discrimination. It is one where feminists\u2019 use of the internet is linked to resistance in other spaces and where the internet allows us to connect and demand accountability.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>A feminist internet is one where online violence against women is taken seriously and addressed</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In this future, there are more feminists and LGBT people in internet governance, making decisions and creating technologies, in contrast to the current male domination of this space. According to Facebook\u2019s <a href=\"http://newsroom.fb.com/news/2015/06/driving-diversity-at-facebook/\" title=\"\">own figures released in 2015</a>, men made up 68% of all employees, 77% of those in senior leadership and 85% of those working in technology. Twitter\u2019s <a href=\"https://blog.twitter.com/2015/we-re-committing-to-a-more-diverse-twitter\" title=\"\">2015 figures</a> reveal that men make up 66% of the company, 87% of those in tech jobs and 78% of those in leadership. <a href=\"https://googleblog.blogspot.com.br/2016/06/focusing-on-diversity30.html\" title=\"\">Google is no better</a> \u2013 men make up 69% of all employees, 76% of those in leadership and 81% of those in technical jobs.</p> <p>These three companies are indicative of the sector as a whole. There is a problem with ethnicity as well as gender, particularly when it comes to who runs companies. At Google for example, even though white people make up 57% of those in tech positions and 59% of the company overall, they hold 70% of leadership positions. This is despite women spending more time on social media than men globally \u2013 5.88 hours compared to 4.75 hours \u2013 and the history of women in computing and technology. It was women like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/ada-lovelace\" title=\"\">Ada Loveleace</a> after all who were the pioneers of computer programming and women made up over two-thirds of those working at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jan/29/the-bletchley-girls-tessa-dunlop-the-debs-of-bletchley-park-michael-smith-review\" title=\"\">Bletchley Park</a> during the second world war.</p> <p>A feminist internet also enables us to challenge the ways capitalism plays out in technological spaces and underlies the drive towards profit, privatisation and control. What does it mean when the primary spaces for so many public and private interactions, including activism, are owned by corporations from one part of the world, run by mainly white men? We need to create alternative forms of economic power around technologies. Using and sharing information about free and open-source software, tools and platforms is key to this.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/26/women-misogynist-trolls-feminist-internet\">When women can be misogynist trolls, we need a feminist internet | Polly Toynbee</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A feminist internet also allows us to harness the power of the internet to convey the realities of women\u2019s lives to the world and to ensure freedom of sexual and gender expression. It takes agency and consent seriously, designing them into thinking, planning and technology. Women need to be able to make informed decisions of what information about themselves will and will not be online, to realise their rights to privacy, digital security and full control over their data. The Snowden revelations about the extent of surveillance are a feminist issue. Surveillance has been used to police black communities for centuries and to restrict women and their movement, speech and activism. It is a real threat to women who defend human rights. This needs to change</p> <p>And yes, a feminist internet is one where online violence against women is taken seriously and addressed. This year marks 10 years of the groundbreaking <a href=\"https://www.takebackthetech.net/\" title=\"\">Take Back the Tech campaign</a>, during which thousands of activists have come together in creative ways, online and offline, to prevent violence against women and girls.

  "<p>I\u2019m a little bit afraid to write about my teacher, David Foster Wallace, because he was important to me, and I don\u2019t want to mess it up. I was afraid to take his class at Pomona College too, for basically the same reason. To get in, you had to audition: students submitted short stories to nab one of 15 spots. I figured if I was rejected, I\u2019d never be a writer. So I cooked up a plan: show up for his office hours, ingratiate myself, and edge out other kids trying to get in the class.</p> <p> The plan didn\u2019t go brilliantly. I was too nervous to make a good impression. I\u2019d bought Brief Interviews With Hideous Men with a gift certificate I\u2019d gotten for high school graduation because I thought the title was funny (much later I\u2019d tell Wallace this and, in one of his occasional lapses of midwestern modesty, he grinned and said: \u201cThat was a really great title.\u201d).</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>He\u2019d pass around a handout titled Your Liberal Arts $s at Work, which collected students' solecisms from the week</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Brief Interviews was my first real encounter with experimental fiction. It freaked me out. At 18, I was a cocky lit kid who hadn\u2019t had my head kicked in by a story since I was a child. But when I figured out these stories wanted me to do real work \u2013 hard work and lots of it \u2013 but that I would be rewarded for it, I\u2019d started thinking about fiction in new ways. Or really in old ways \u2013 when I was a child, my favourite stories were the ones that were strange and exciting and tough to figure out, which felt right, because the world was often like that, too. Children are ideal readers of experimental fiction because childhood itself is experimental, whereas teenage smart alecks are terrible readers of experimental fiction, because they\u2019ve deluded themselves into thinking they\u2019ve figured everything out (adults are even worse). But Wallace\u2019s stories made me feel like I was reading as a kid again. I kept buying his books. </p> <p> And now there I was in his office. I asked him whether there was anything I should know about submitting the writing sample. He said he thought the instructions in the course catalogue were clear. (They were. Everything he wrote was \u2013 Wallace spoke, emailed, and composed course descriptions in the same precise style as his famous prose.) I wasn\u2019t ready to leave after 90 seconds, so I asked him how he\u2019d be evaluating the submissions. He softened. I think he\u2019d figured out my whole pathetic enterprise. He told me that judging the merits of these short pieces was about as exact as throwing them down the stairs and seeing which ones made it the farthest, then tacked on a warning: \u201cMake sure you check it over for typos and errors.\u201d And he then tacked on another: \u201cMore than once.\u201d</p> <p> Wallace was famously obsessed with English usage, and it showed in his teaching. Each week he\u2019d pass around a handout titled Your Liberal Arts $s at Work, which collected solecisms perpetrated by students in the previous week\u2019s writing. We\u2019d quickly scan the sheets for proper nouns \u2014 when you recognised one of your characters\u2019 names on the page, you knew you were in for a public scolding. \u201cYou do not make grammatical errors when you\u2019re swinging for the fences,\u201d Wallace said during the first class, only instead of \u201cerrors\u201d, he used a word I\u2019m assuming is unprintable in British newspapers. I wrote this admonishment down in a notebook where I collected things Wallace said that I never wanted to forget. I think most of the other kids kept one of these going too.</p> <p> Wallace had his reasons for grammatical zealotry in the classroom, but it wasn\u2019t about being Gradgrindian or prescriptive. I think Wallace is rightly understood as a moral writer \u2013 so much of his work explores what it means not just to be human, but to be a good human \u2013 but he was also an ethical one. He was always talking about a writer\u2019s responsibilities: the responsibility to be clear, the responsibility to be interesting. Because Wallace\u2019s work could be difficult, because he asked the reader to work, he wanted to be sure he was doing his work too, saying exactly what he intended, in a way that was compelling. Another entry from my notebook: \u201cIf you\u2019re more interested in what you\u2019re saying than the person listening to you is, you\u2019re the definition of a boring person.\u201d I remember feeling like I\u2019d been slapped with a stick. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2016/sep/12/books-to-give-you-hope-this-is-water-by-david-foster-wallace\">Books to give you hope: This is Water by David Foster Wallace</a> </p> </aside>  <p> The first thing Wallace asked me that first day, when I showed up in his office angling for a place in his workshop, was why I wanted to take his class. When I told him I wanted to write children\u2019s books, he winced and said he didn\u2019t know anything about writing for kids. I told him that I didn\u2019t want to learn how to write for kids, I just wanted to learn how to write. He did teach me how to write, or at least how to go about writing, and it\u2019s a lot tougher than putting together a clean and well-wrought sentence. It\u2019s as tough as having a real conversation.

  "<p>A pioneer monument and a lot of state troopers with batons and riot helmets stood between the mostly young native activists and the North Dakota state capitol on Friday afternoon. Many of the activists arriving at the capitol\u2019s vast green lawn hadn\u2019t heard that the Washington DC judge had decided against the Standing Rock reservation Sioux lawsuit. That was the lawsuit asserting that the Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL) had gone forward without adequate tribal consultation. There was a sign of anguish when the news was delivered by megaphone, and then, a few minutes later, shouts of joy as a young woman with a long black braid standing in the pouring rain announced the victory chasing the heels of that defeat. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/18/north-dakota-pipeline-activists-bakken-oil-fields\">'We are protectors, not protesters': why I'm fighting the North Dakota pipeline</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In a joint statement on Friday by the US army, the Department of Justice, and the Department of the Interior (which oversees Native American affairs), two major decisions were announced. One was a decision by the US army corps of engineers, the permitting body for the pipeline, to hold off on issuing permits to dig on federal land near or under the Missouri river above the Standing Rock reservation. The other was a landmark announcement that this fall, the government would discuss with tribes how \u201cto better ensure meaningful tribal input into infrastructure-related reviews and decisions and the protection of tribal lands, resources, and treaty rights\u201d and whether new legislation should be put in place to pursue those goals. It\u2019s at least an implicit and maybe an explicit acknowledgment that the permitting process for the DAPL fell short of meeting the Standing Rock Sioux\u2019s rights. It may become a landmark decision for all native rights in the United States, and it appears to be the result of tremendous international public pressure that probably changed the outcome of what could have been another quiet defeat. </p> <p>What\u2019s happening at Standing Rock is extraordinary and possibly transformative for native rights, Sioux history, and the intersection of the climate movement with indigenous communities. I spent two days in the Red Warrior camp, the big camp with dozens of teepees, hundreds of tents, and at least 1,000 people. It\u2019s across the small Cannonball river from the Sacred Stone camp founded this spring to catalyze resistance against the DAPL intended to bring dirty crude from the Bakken oil shale in the northwest of North Dakota to Illinois, then down to refineries in the Gulf of Mexico for export. Resistance has been catalyzed, and the world electrified by the gathering of participants from tribes across North America and non-native supporters.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2791475badbb9e79ce6b4a0b27a8f617eabc91c5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2791475badbb9e79ce6b4a0b27a8f617eabc91c5/0_0_4256_2832/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dakota protesters\" width=\"1000\" height=\"665\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Protesters near the Standing Rock Sioux reservation in Cannon Ball, North Dakota, on Friday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Cullen/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Friday morning in the camp, I asked Dallas Goldtooth of the Indigenous Environmental Network what were the precedents for this. Sitting in the back of his minivan, as his small children milled about and the boy across the road came to shake his hand, he told me: \u201cThere\u2019s nothing, honestly. There\u2019s nothing that can compare. One-hundred and eighty different tribal nations have sent letters of solidarity.\u201d Goldtooth, who is Dakota and Dene, went on to describe the unprecedented support of tribes from all over the United States and Canada for this resistance, along with climate and environmental groups \u2013 a coalition with tremendous possibility for the future of both indigenous rights and the climate movement. </p> <p>The joy is widespread. The first person I met was a young Hoopa/Yurok woman from far-northern California, who told me this is the most amazing thing she\u2019s ever been part of. The next morning, a small man came up and greeted me, introduced himself as Frank, \u201cfrom right here\u201d, a member of the Standing Rock Sioux. Somewhere in the conversation he said : \u201cI wake up happy every day about this.\u201d I asked him how this changed the past, thinking of the losses the Lakota/Sioux faced over the past 150 years, but he heard the question differently. He mentioned that their old enemies the Crow and the Cheyenne came to stand with them, and that the old divisions are over. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/gallery/2016/aug/25/north-dakota-pipeline-protest-pictures\">Faces of the North Dakota pipeline protest: 'Sacred land is who we are'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>When I asked that question, I was thinking about what I heard from climate activist and environmental lawyer Carolyn Raffensperger, who had spent time at the camp earlier and has a long history in the area. \u201cThere are moments in history that can heal the past and the future,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is a healing moment. It\u2019s extraordinary. I\u2019m hoping that it heals the river, which has suffered assaults that are unspeakable.\u201d Though climate activists oppose the pipeline, because it\u2019s part of the machinery to keep fossil fuel flowing and temperatures rising, the Standing Rock oppose it because it would tunnel underneath the Missouri river and threaten their water supply if it ever ruptures.</p> <p>The river is their only source of water. And as Raffensberger mentioned, it has been violated in many ways, including by the Oahe Dam in South Dakota, which turned a free-flowing river into a long unnatural lake. The Cannonball river used to meet the Missouri in such a way that their their turbulent waters turned out big round stones \u2013 which white people saw as cannonballs, thus the name \u2013 but now the smaller river sinks quietly into the lake, and the stones are gone and so are the forces that made them. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There are moments in history that can heal the past and the future</p> <footer> <cite>Carolyn Raffensperger</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>As Standing Rock tribal chairman David Archambault said in an editorial last month: \u201cWhen the Army Corps of Engineers dammed the Missouri River in 1958, it took our riverfront forests, fruit orchards and most fertile farmland to create Lake Oahe. Now the Corps is taking our clean water and sacred places by approving this river crossing. Whether it\u2019s gold from the Black Hills or hydropower from the Missouri or oil pipelines that threaten our ancestral inheritance, the tribes have always paid the price for America\u2019s prosperity.\u201d It will again, if the corporations and banks behind the DAPL have their way, but this may be a turning point in history; they could lose. </p> <p>That\u2019s what members of Native American nations from the California Yurok to the Michigan Chippewa and the other activists and supporters are hoping, and it\u2019s a tremendous hope against the odds or at least against the record of the past. Victors like to forget how they got their spoils, but the despoiled have long memories. In the central circle of the camp, some words and ideas recurred: that peace and prayer were the means here, that being humble mattered, that ancestors mattered, that this was nonviolent. </p> <p>I met an older woman from the Pine Ridge reservation, one of the poorest places in the United States and the site of some of the fiercest Native American resistance in the 1970s. She told me she had come when the camp was just beginning, when she saw seven teepees there. The next morning there were hundreds of people, and the occupation had stepped up a level. It kept growing, and there are plans to continue, though a Dakota winter may winnow out all but the toughest. When I arrived, the camp spread in all directions from the main entrance on the road. A long avenue of flagpoles lined the main road down what had been grasslands before, with nearly 200 flags from native nations around the country. Near the entrance was a sprawling camp kitchen, with mountains of supplies, indoor and outdoor facilities and open fires on which some of the cooking was done, and all of the gigantic vats of coffee seemed to be boiled. The grass was flattened and dried in some places, worn through in others, and after Wednesday\u2019s rain some of the bare places became mud wallows. People made camp on both sides, some in tall white or painted teepees, most in tents, a few in recreational vehicles.<br></p> <p>Horses were staked in the grass or kept in small corrals. People flew flags, covered their car in graffiti \u2013 \u201cWater is life\u201d or its equivalent in Lakota, \u201cMni wiconi\u201d, and \u201cNo DAPL\u201d were the most common slogans. There was a remarkable absence of brochures, leaflets and petitions, along with meetings and perceptible organizational structure. There was a classroom, a table where volunteers lawyers were available (they were also there to witness and represent anyone who might be arrested), sweatlodges. It was a village, though one without commerce of any kind or alcohol, drugs, or weapons. People chopped wood, fed horses, made coffee, visited with their neighbors, told their stories, came to ceremonies and talks, and waited to see how they could make history. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5942af12749a4a43b6b484e1b392d2c3c8542a14\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5942af12749a4a43b6b484e1b392d2c3c8542a14/0_27_3351_2011/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pipeline protest encampment\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A protest encampment near Cannon Ball, where members of some 200 Native American tribes from across the US and Canada have gathered to lend their support to the Standing Rock Sioux tribe\u2019s opposition to the pipeline.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Robyn Beck/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Which left time on some days for cultural celebration by a thousand people from dozens of cultures. Thursday, the people of the Pacific north-west paddled down the Missouri river in magnificent boats they had brought with them. They were scheduled to come up the Cannonball about 3pm, and people were beginning to line the shore when runners came to call people to the central circle where ceremonies were held and information distributed. There, Archambault spoke about the governor\u2019s calling out the national guard, seeking to calm fears by saying they would be used for traffic management and would never be allowed to come to the camp.</p> <p>In fact, men in uniform from the sheriff\u2019s department and state troopers were already being used to turn people back on Highway 1806, which goes south from the Bismarck area to the reservation. I ran into them Wednesday afternoon, looking like they were combat-ready for Afghanistan, and they appeared to be turning all cars back not far down the highway from Bismarck. I took a huge detour through the rolling green countryside and got back without a mishap, but the goal seemed to be discouragement. On Friday, I saw more uniformed men turning people back about a dozen miles above the camp and then, again, further north, another blockade sending people back. There seems to be a concerted effort to prevent people from reaching the camp or to at least inconvenience them. </p> <p>Meanwhile, Archambault spoke, and then everyone wandered back to shore where the huge Tlingit boat and other crafts were arriving. Goldtooth had noted that the river tribes had who responded most strongly, groups who had fought or were fighting their own battles over water. The ceremonies were unhurried, with the boats passing by and then pointing their prows to shore and asking, with speeches of gratitude, songs in native languages, and jokes, permission to land.</p> <p>The fight is about water and rights. The Missouri is the longest river in the United States, joining the Mississippi at St Louis; any pollution caused by a spill from the DAPL on its current route would impact the reservation first but would continue downstream all the way to the Gulf of Mexico. It would impact a huge swathe of the agriculture and residents at the center of the continent. You could also note that the Missouri and Mississippi meet close to where a police officer killed Michael Brown in Ferguson, a suburb of St Louis, the event that prompted the formation of Black Lives Matter (members of which were also at the camp showing solidarity). The river goes onward to flow past New Orleans, where the natural disaster of Hurricane Katrina turned into the unnatural disaster of a city blockaded and its citizens shot down and stranded by the authorities. Histories flow together. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"346955435e382557b2489e05f1308feb23441c20\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/346955435e382557b2489e05f1308feb23441c20/0_0_4928_2957/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Native American protesters\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Women and girls from the Colorado River Indian tribes dance after arriving at a protest encampment near Cannon Ball, North Dakota.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Robyn Beck/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>What\u2019s happening at Standing Rock feels like a new civil rights movement that takes place at the confluence of environmental and human rights and grows from the last 60 years of lived experience in popular power and changing the world. This is already a movement with national solidarity \u2013 there were support demonstrations in San Francisco and Tulsa, Oklahoma, among other places \u2013 and a national day of action is scheduled for Tuesday. </p> <p>Many involved in the climate movement see it as a human rights movement or a movement inseparable from human rights. Indigenous people have played a huge role, as the people in many of the places where extracting and transporting fossil fuel take place, as protectors of particular places and ecosystems from rivers to forests, from the Amazon to the Arctic, as people with a strong sense of the past and the future, of the deep time in which short-term profit turns into longterm damage, and of the rights of the collective over individual profit. All these forces are antithetical to capitalism, and it to them. </p> <p>There is nothing guaranteed about the outcome for the DAPL, the larger movement that the uprising at Standing Rock has begun, and the connections it strengthens. It\u2019s only a beginning but it\u2019s a spectacular beginning and a reminder that sometimes the future is made by dreamers and warriors who come together unexpectedly. </p>",

In Damascus, still a stronghold of the Syrian president, there was little faith on Saturday that rebel groups would honour elements of the deal to disavow extremism. A lawyer from the Mezze neighbourhood of the Syrian capital, who called himself Abu Kareem, said: \u201cThey have been in our midst for the past three years. They are on our doorsteps, sending mortars and bombers at us. These are the so-called moderates.\u201d</p> <p>Even among the major powers themselves, there was a palpable sense that the ceasefire would be difficult to implement. Much of it hinges on Moscow\u2019s ability to rein in the Assad regime, and particularly to convince officials to allow aid to get to besieged areas. Syrian leaders have consistently used starvation sieges as weapons of war throughout the conflict, despite protests from the UN and western governments.</p> <p>The methods have proved effective, with remaining opposition fighters and communities from the Damascus enclave of Darraya surrendering in late August, with many agreeing to be moved to Idlib.

It will also be used to prevent Syrian jets from attacking areas that are part of the agreed truce.</p> <p>By changing its name in July and severing overt links to al-Qaida, al-Nusra tried to reposition itself as a Syrian nationalist group that might be accepted as a legitimate entity within the opposition. Those plans were quickly dashed when Washington added the renamed group to its list of proscribed terror organisations. US officials continue to believe that some elements of it are using the chaos of Syria to plan attacks in Europe and beyond.</p> <p>The staunch position against the jihadis is lost on some senior rebels. \u201cSo, assuming [the truce] does hold over the festival, how can anyone take them on their word to allow supplies into Aleppo?\u201d asked Mahmudi. \u201cWe are blocked from both ends.

  "<p>The last time I returned to Washington DC, I arrived as I usually do, by train into Union Station. It was the end of March, the day before Easter Sunday, and the platforms teemed with travellers coming into town to see the city\u2019s cherry blossoms, gifted to the city more than a hundred years ago by the mayor of Tokyo.</p> <p>The colonnade of delicately blossomed trees along the Tidal Basin walkway to the Jefferson Memorial is a historical and aesthetic delight for visitors; but for me, as a child, they were a harbinger of Washington\u2019s aggressive hay fever season. When I was in high school, I would do my best to run speed workouts on the track while inhaling my own snot and wheezing through pollen-aggravated wind pipes. As an adult, I discovered Claritin and my whole world changed.</p> <p>When I return by train, weather permitting, I often walk the mile-and-a-half from Union Station to the White House along Constitution Avenue before catching an Uber home, just to reacquaint myself with some of the structures and institutions that make my city so unique.</p> <p>Here are the Smithsonian Museum buildings, many of which I entered as a child on school field trips. This is the majestic, David Adjaye-designed African American History Museum, so long overdue. There is the Washington monument in marble of two shades because the civil war disrupted its construction. Here is the White House, where the most powerful man in the world resides \u2013 for a few months longer, a black man like me. This is the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/federal-reserve\">Federal Reserve</a>, which for conspiracy theorists is the ultimate arbiter of all our fates. And here are the paths one million people marched along to hear Dr Martin Luther King preach for an end to America\u2019s love affair with structured hate.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d251da667fadf3bc24c88ad6018321d8150dd16e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d251da667fadf3bc24c88ad6018321d8150dd16e/0_171_2525_1515/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cherry blossom in front of Jefferson Memorial, Washington DC, March 2011\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cherry blossom in front of the Jefferson Memorial \u2013 \u2018a harbinger of Washington\u2019s aggressive hay fever season.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Beau Finley</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Washington DC is not a subtle city. Unlike the capitals of other once-great powers which, many hundreds of years old, present a more seamless meshing of monumental memory and daily life, DC is constructed to shout \u201cHere I am!

But I\u2019m in love with a city that cannot fully love me back</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But walking among the tourists earlier this year, I was filled with both smugness and sadness. Unlike these interlopers, I was born on this soil, within the 70 sq miles divided into four large quadrants that constitute our nation\u2019s capital. I consider this city and these public spaces my own, yet I am cowed by the vastness of its outsized influence.</p> <p>I rep Washington DC \u2013 hard \u2013 despite not having really lived here since I graduated from high school, and despite spending the past few years working in Lagos. DC is in my blood, my diction, my sensibility and style. I am, though, in love with a city that cannot fully love me back.</p> <p> **** </p> <p>My DC starts in 1982 at the Washington Hospital Center. I was born in a city that was nearly 70% black. They called it \u201cChocolate City\u201d: birthplace of Duke Ellington and Marvin Gaye, home of Chuck Brown and the city\u2019s idiosyncratic Go-Go music.</p> <p>Ronald Reagan was not quite two years into his presidency, and Marion Barry was still a mayor celebrated for having made the jump from civil rights activist to consummate city politician. Pennsylvania Avenue in front of the White House was still an active thoroughfare, not yet closed to traffic for fear of assassination attempts or terrorist attacks.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"3b2c951deaed2f9a38d2c61074cb053fec2e119e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3b2c951deaed2f9a38d2c61074cb053fec2e119e/0_410_3264_1958/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Uzodinma and his father.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Uzodinma with his father at his high school graduation</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Uzodinma Iweala</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There was also trouble. Drug usage and crime rates had steadily escalated through the 1970s, creating a vicious cycle of white flight and depressed municipal revenue, which in turn led to decreased services, increased poverty, worsening crime and further white flight to the Maryland and Virginia suburbs.</p> <p>The DC I entered was a divided city, populated by a minority white elite in the upper north-west section of the city that buzzed around the corridors of power; and a majority mixture of black wealthy, middle and working class \u2013 with the poorest residents confined to pockets of debilitating poverty, and largely ignored in the city\u2019s outward projection of itself.</p> <p>Yet this great divide did not manifest in the way you might have noticed in other cities.<br></p> <p> For as long as I can remember, the majority of Washington DC\u2019s police force has been black. For that reason, perhaps, the city has been spared some of the worst excesses of police brutality, exacerbated by racial misunderstanding. But young as we were, my siblings and I still felt the racial tensions in assumptions our friends and their parents made about where we should live (read: not in the affluent suburb of Potomac); in the joking remarks white classmates made about majority black sections of the city (automatically the ghetto) to which they had most likely never been; in the skin colour of the people riding the metro buses compared to those on the subway or driving their cars; and in white people\u2019s presumption of incompetence on the part of the mostly black city officials.</p> <p> Even more troubling to me was the fact that growing up white in Northwest DC or the surrounding suburbs meant one could get away with not noticing these complex racial dynamics. I\u2019m pretty certain that for many of my classmates at the elite private school I attended, my black classmates and I formed the majority of their substantive interactions with people of colour. </p> <p>But Washington DC has always been a divided city, most obviously between the officialdom of the United States federal government headquartered here, and the informal lives of the people who inhabit the city and its surrounding suburbs. It is a city fractured by its infatuation with official remembrance (as seen in its monuments and museums), and its seeming indifference to the personal memories of the permanent residents whose lives have truly shaped it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"21fe071b5dfe90a8352222b035fc957b9d597f6e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/21fe071b5dfe90a8352222b035fc957b9d597f6e/0_76_2820_1692/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The National Mall in Washington DC.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The National Mall in Washington DC.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Beau Finley</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>***</p> <p>People often speak of DC as if it has always existed in its pure state; as if brought to us by virgin birth. In fact, its territory was carved from two slave-holding states. Within its original borders were two slave trading ports: the first in what is now the trendy north-west neighbourhood of Georgetown, and the second in the modern city of Alexandria, Virginia.<br></p> <p>Upon its founding, nearly a quarter of DC\u2019s population was black, and just under 10% of that population was free. The city\u2019s grand avenues and whitewashed structures were built by black slaves and freemen for the powerful white men who met inside to pass laws and uphold social norms that severely compromised the fundamental rights of black Americans.<br></p> <p>Slavery is the reason DC looks like a half-eaten sandwich on a map. Slave holders in Virginia feared a growing abolitionist block in the United States congress might eventually push to outlaw slavery in the federal capital, so they petitioned to have the portion of the capital donated by Virginia returned to the state in 1846.<br></p> <p>Four years later, congress outlawed the slave trade in the nation\u2019s capital. Soon after, during the nation\u2019s catastrophic civil war, the 13th amendment abolished slavery in all states, triggering an influx of ex-slaves from the south who sought safety and opportunity in this relatively progressive enclave.<br></p> <p>DC has since seen the rise of a flourishing black community that, despite both legalised and de facto segregation, managed to found the nation\u2019s most prominent historically black university (shout out to Howard \u2013 I see you), produce a strong class of black professionals and artists, and amass black wealth in a way few other black communities have done in the United States. This was in part due to the benefits of proximity to an ever-expanding federal government \u2013 which was generally more progressive than the southern state governments that did everything in their power to limit the freedoms and economic progress of black citizens. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4de77062aad270cb181f01a93424061df9194d3a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4de77062aad270cb181f01a93424061df9194d3a/0_278_4463_2678/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Buskers in DC\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Washington DC has seen the rise of a flourishing black community despite its history of segregation.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Beau Finley</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>***</p> <p>When my mother came to Washington DC in the early 1980s, she had three things on her mind: her new job at the World Bank, the one-year-old baby girl she gave birth to just before earning her PhD, and me \u2013 as yet unborn but already demanding a larger living space than she and my father had originally intended for their \u201ctemporary\u201d sojourn in America.</p> <p>My mother found a three-bedroom apartment at 4600 Connecticut Avenue just a few blocks from the Van Ness metro station, and half a mile from the Wesley United Methodist Church where I was baptised, attended pre-school, and where we still attend Christmas Eve service when assembled as a family during the holidays.</p> <p>For my mother, the decision to live in Northwest DC was practical. She didn\u2019t have a car and needed to be close to her demanding job; and she needed something affordable (which much of the city was at that time). When she interned at the World Bank as a young graduate student, her African and black colleagues advised her to avoid Virginia because, despite cheaper accommodation, its political and cultural history made it more hostile to minorities.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"eb1ddcfc56adda83b6ab75a0875f586af6038096\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eb1ddcfc56adda83b6ab75a0875f586af6038096/0_376_3264_1958/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Uzodinma Iweala family photo, Washington DC\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Iweala family at Uzodinma\u2019s high school graduation</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Uzodinma Iweala</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI almost took a place in Adams Morgan, but the apartment was too dark,\u201d my mother told me the last time I was home, as she drove me to Union Station to catch my train back to New York. Adams Morgan is now an overly trendy area to the north-east of Dupont Circle, but 30 years ago, it was more immigrant, more black and Hispanic: the kind of place your mother dragged you after church on Sunday so she could buy oxtail, crayfish and dried cod from the Latin American and African grocers selling the ingredients of the Nigerian food we regularly ate.</p> <p>Later, after adding two more children, my family moved to Potomac, Maryland in large part because my father, a man who values his quiet and privacy, wanted enough space that he didn\u2019t have to see his neighbours unless absolutely necessary.</p> <p>My mother built her career in downtown Washington DC at the World Bank headquarters, close to the White House. She worked with the international and domestic policy makers and practitioners who often move to Washington in waves as presidential administrations, congressional terms and ambassadorial appointments turn over. <br></p> <p>Most of the kids I went to school with were white. They lived in neighbourhoods of white people, shopped in grocery stores with other white people, attended church or synagogue with other white people. For them, and in large part for me and my siblings, DC was wealthy and white \u2013 even if this wealthy whiteness was hardly representative of the city. Perhaps I\u2019m unkind, but I\u2019d wager that many of my classmates were unaware, except for the odd cross-cultural or cross-class interaction, that the city they lived in actually looked more like me than them.<br></p> <p>I knew this because my father worked in a Washington DC just a few miles from my mother\u2019s office, but worlds away culturally, economically and psychologically.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I\u2019d wager that many of my classmates were unaware that the city they lived in actually looked more like me than them</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>If my mother worked in official DC, then my father, when he finally moved over from the United Kingdom and began work at Providence Hospital in Northeast DC, built his career in unofficial Washington. Located on Varnum Street Northeast, Providence sat in a working-class black neighbourhood not far from the Shrine of the Immaculate Conception.</p> <p>On the drive there, I would notice how the houses shrank in size and grew closer together. Some had fake green turf lining their front steps. There were fewer trees and the grass in the beds separating the curb and street was patchy and brown. The streets also had more cracks and potholes than in other areas of the city. Though it was perfectly safe and pleasant, it was evident, even to a child\u2019s eye, that this place received less attention than parts of Northwest DC.<br></p> <p>When my father first started at Providence in 1993, his patients worked unglamorous jobs as teachers and support staff for government offices, as bus drivers, police officers and firemen. They carried with them stories of a vibrant and diverse majority subculture that, largely unbeknown to greater America and the world, built and shaped DC.</p> <p>I remember working in Providence\u2019s stuffy medical library, which occasionally would fill with black doctors and nurses taking a quick break away from the hectic wards. I also remember walking around and hearing an entirely different kind of English spoken: a slow, almost southern drawl that was instantly inviting and comforting. Washington DC\u2019s indigenous (for want of a better term) black folk were kind and open. They asked strangers, \u201cHow is your day?\u201d and smiled, because that was good manners.<br></p> <p>\u201cI liked it,\u201d my father told me when I asked what it was like to move from Manchester, England and Edinburgh, Scotland to black America. \u201cI was finally able to practise; to use my skills to take care of people and make money to support my family; and to work in a community that appreciates your work even more because you look like them.\u201d<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"91c4e81904091b867b0d133336e858d2e6244684\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/91c4e81904091b867b0d133336e858d2e6244684/0_123_5322_3193/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ben\u2019s Chili Bowl, U Street, Washington DC, December 2015\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Two decades ago U Street was a predominately black neighbourhood, but has since been gentrified.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Beau Finley</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>***</p> <p>All that changed with the city\u2019s budget crisis of the mid-1990s. These were the nascent years of the extreme partisanship and Republican intransigence during the (hopefully) first Clinton presidency, that managed to shut down the federal government \u2013 twice \u2013 including right after the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/capital-weather-gang/wp/2016/01/06/remembering-the-blizzard-of-1996-that-paralyzed-washington-d-c/\">blizzard of 96</a> (which meant DC schools were closed for almost two weeks).<br></p> <p>As usually happens during spats between the branches of the federal government, DC got tossed around in the middle, and ended up being stripped of its little sovereignty when President Clinton and the Republicans agreed to appoint a \u201ccontrol board\u201d to oversee city finances.</p> <p>As with many American urban centres that have seen financial hardship, this meant corporate executives making hardnosed decisions to cut services and save money. One of the casualties was DC General, the city\u2019s public hospital, which served lower-income communities across the district. After DC General\u2019s closure, hospitals such as Providence saw an increase in patients from some of the city\u2019s more neglected areas, and it wasn\u2019t pretty. \u201cWe saw a lot more gunshot wounds. We saw much more in terms of drug addiction and alcoholism,\u201d my father told me.<br></p> <p>The worst was that hospitals in Northwest such as George Washington University Hospital \u2013 where President Reagan was treated after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/27/john-hinckley-jr-release-ronald-reagan-assassination-attempt\">John Hinckley\u2019s attempt to assassinate him</a>, and where my youngest brother now works as a resident orthopaedic surgeon \u2013 would illegally turn these patients away by telling them they could not treat their problems. \u201cHow can you do that? It\u2019s not right! It\u2019s reprehensible,\u201d my father told me, his voice still brimming with anger many years later.<br></p> <p>They could do it because of a dissonance at the core of Washington DC\u2019s existence. The people turned away didn\u2019t fit the whitewashed image of the marketable city, even though they were the majority of the population. It was the same reason my siblings and I were able to attend posh schools that could \u201cachieve\u201d a black student enrolment of 10% in a city more than 60% African American, and find those figures cause for celebration.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2484fc912aecd96e05524b286ca53ca528ec3b60\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2484fc912aecd96e05524b286ca53ca528ec3b60/0_284_4830_2898/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The NY Avenue area was burnt during 1968 riots in DC.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The NY Avenue area was burnt during 1968 riots in DC.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Beau Finley</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Two of my closest friends in school, Aaron and Ismael, were black (we comprised 33% of the black population of our high school class) and lived in what were then majority black areas. They were always aware of, but hardly surprised by, how different the city looked after a journey of a few miles.</p> <p>\u201cI have to remind myself that it\u2019s not required that your parents give you a car when you turn 16,\u201d Ismael said once, as we sat in the large, blue Volvo station wagon that my parents had bequeathed to my sister when she started driving, and that I inherited when I turned 16. I took comfort in the fact that, compared to some classmates who drove Audis, BMWs and Range Rovers, my Volvo was \u201cslumming it\u201d. <br></p> <p>Ismael lived in the U street area of Northwest on Riggs Street, between 13th and 14th streets. Today the area is full of chic restaurants, multimillion-dollar row houses and condos and white yuppies (and their strollers). Twenty years ago, it was a predominantly black neighbourhood with more liquor stores than trendy restaurants, and more African immigrants from countries like Ethiopia than American immigrants from Idaho and Montana.</p> <p> This is the neighbourhood where my father asked me to drop the car off with a Ghanaian man who owned a vacant lot full of problematic Mercedes Benzes and Volvos that he fixed for much less than the dealership a few miles away on Wisconsin Avenue. Young black children played in the streets because backyards were small. The pavements cracked over prying tree roots and there were some businesses with boarded windows; a testament to the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonian.com/2008/04/01/people-were-out-of-control-remembering-the-1968-riots/\">1968 riots that decimated a neighbourhood</a> which had been an incubator for the black artistic renaissance of the early 20th century.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>More and more sections of DC are beginning to look the way city has always thought it looked</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>At the time, property values were much lower. Ismael\u2019s parents bought their row house in the 1980s for less than $100,000 (\u00a375,000). His mother was recently offered over a million in cash for that same property.</p> <p>What\u2019s changed? Quite simply, more and more sections of DC are beginning to look the way city has always <em>thought</em> it looked. I remember one visit to Ismael\u2019s neighbourhood where he pointed to a house at the end of the block with a rainbow flag flying from its porch. \u201cThere are some gay guys living there now,\u201d he said.</p> <p> This was the mid-1990s so being gay was still a big deal. It was also a harbinger of change; an almost textbook sign that gentrification was on its way. First wealthy but socially unacceptable white people who nobody wants to live next to find acceptance among black people who nobody has ever wanted to live next to. Then, years later, I\u2019m more likely to run into a white college classmate on the way back from grocery shopping \u2013 tote bag slung over her shoulder, kale leaves peaking over the edge \u2013 than I am to see one of Ismael\u2019s old neighbours who can speak to the rise and fall and rise of a community that has always been integral to the city\u2019s life.</p> <p>As Ismael put it one afternoon a couple of years ago when he, Aaron and I sat at Hooters in Chinatown salivating over the chicken wings: \u201cWhen we were in high school, our white classmates used to come here with fake IDs to buy alcohol for their parties, and I didn\u2019t like that. Now they live here and they don\u2019t like that my mum does too.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"1cacc2b782cc1d9fdf4d2071a98e3a3f2fa22802\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1cacc2b782cc1d9fdf4d2071a98e3a3f2fa22802/577_0_3288_1973/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Metro station, Washington DC, May 2016\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Has gentrification really benefited Washingtonians?</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Beau Finley</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Gentrification is a tough topic to consider, especially given that my education, income and love for kale means I am demographically a gentrifier myself. For the gentrifiers and those in neighbourhoods being gentrified, there are contradictory emotions caused by the interplay of race, class and ambition in the winner-takes-all pursuit of constant growth that we have termed urban renewal.<br></p> <p> Like many major cities built around a humming economic engine (LA has entertainment, New York has finance, my city has the ever-growing, ever-giving federal government), DC is an epicentre for urban renewal \u2013 and thus a locus of intense debate and discomfort around how this change impacts the \u201csoul\u201d of the city.</p> <p>DC\u2019s economic transformation began when Anthony Williams, the control board-backed chief financial officer of the city was elected mayor in 1999. In his two terms, Williams brought over $40bn of investment to the city. Coupled with an expanding federal government during the presidencies of George W Bush and Barack Obama, this led to an unprecedented increase in population, increased pressure on existing housing stock, and a demographic transformation that has seen Washington\u2019s African American population decrease by <a href=\"https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=HolwxdMeTwYC&amp;pg=PA1887&amp;dq=Washington%E2%80%99s+African+American+population+decreased+by+7.3%25&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjoub7EyP_OAhXFCsAKHaZLAr0Q6AEIHjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Washington%E2%80%99s%20African%20American%20population%20decreased%20by%207.3%25&amp;f=false\">7.3% while the white population has increased by 17.8%</a> over the last 15 years.<br></p> <p> Washington\u2019s new younger, often whiter money meets its older darker residents in a process that has accelerated under two subsequent mayors, and resulted in the conundrums facing places like the H Street Northeast corridor, where my friend and original New Yorker Mary lived during her time at Georgetown Law School \u2013 and where an influx of students, hipsters and Hill staffers has brought new economic life, but also the possibility of cultural erasure, to another historically black subsection of the city.</p> <p>***</p> <p>One morning in late 2015 when visiting Mary to attend her law school graduation ceremony, plagued by jet lag, I slipped out of her house early to take a walk around her neighbourhood. As the sun rose, I steered clear of the new hipster pubs and draft beer houses on H Street, and instead followed side streets where aged row houses stooped towards the sidewalk.</p> <p>I nodded to a dreadlocked man waxing a large SUV. I felt myself being watched, followed. From across the road, a man and a woman cat-called me. I pretended not to hear and continued my stroll, but they crossed the street to stand on the sidewalk in front of me.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"c2adee4681255a54c3158c9d1e71c0e387b47205\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c2adee4681255a54c3158c9d1e71c0e387b47205/0_330_4944_2966/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Fire station in upper Northwest at night, Washington DC, February 2014\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The fire station in upper Northwest.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Beau Finley</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The man was rail thin, and wore cut-off jean shorts with frayed hems and a blue form-fitting tank top that exposed his sinewy arms. He waved his skeletal fingers at me. His companion, a shorter, rounder woman with close-cropped platinum hair and a pot belly, stepped forward.<br></p> <p> \u201cYou new to the neighbourhood?\u201d the man asked.</p> <p> \u201cJust visiting,\u201d I said.</p> <p> \u201cWhere from?\u201d the woman asked, stepping closer. I stood my ground. \u201cYou thinking of coming here and buying one of our houses, aren\u2019t you?\u201d she asked.</p> <p> \u201cNo, no,\u201d I said with a nervous laugh, \u201cI\u2019m from Nigeria\u201d \u2013 thinking that distance would ease the tension.</p> <p> \u201cBut you want one of our houses,\u201d she insisted. \u201cPeople keep coming up in here buying our houses and shit, changing the neighbourhood and shit. Must be because we got that good stuff.\u201d </p> <p>Then she reached forward and grabbed my crotch. \u201cYou want that good stuff?\u201d Her companion squealed with delight as she cackled: \u201cYou come with us. We can show you that good stuff.\u201d</p> <p> \u201cUm. No, thank you,\u201d I said, and quickly stepped on to the grassy patch next to the sidewalk and hurried off. As I quickened my pace, I could hear them cackling to each other. The man in the tank top finger-waved good bye.</p> <p> I was shocked, mostly by the unwanted sexual contact, but also by the realness of demographic and community change across the city. According to the architecture critic Robert Bevan: \u201cIn part, we recognise our place in the world by an interaction with the built environment and remembering these experiences, and by being informed of the experiences of others: the creation of a social identity located in time and place.\u201d</p> <p>So what happens when the built environment changes directly beneath your feet; when new money brings new structures, or the reconfiguration of old structures, that define a physical-mental-emotional space?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0fcc4d109a44926db260255d216cc24e8de49781\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0fcc4d109a44926db260255d216cc24e8de49781/0_27_3264_1958/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Iweala as a child.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Iweala as a child.

Suddenly, the face of a neighbourhood in real-estate brochures and tourism posters becomes an appropriately bearded 30-something white man or his smiling, blue-eyed girlfriend, their ethnically ambiguous interracial couple friends, and occasionally someone who looks like me.

I just wonder why it\u2019s only when white people move to a place that people suddenly pay attention.\u201d<br></p> <p>As the city\u2019s demographic shift results in better services for once-black areas that now have increased white populations; as newcomers without concern for the city\u2019s rich history and implicit biases become more populous, and unconsciously use the city\u2019s security apparatus to neutralise difference that makes them uncomfortable; and as the city\u2019s police department itself becomes less black, less integrated with the communities it serves, and more aggressive, people lose faith that the city they once knew still wants to know them.</p> <p>***</p> <p>Like all things, cities must change \u2013 even a city as enamoured of the past and memory as DC.

  "<p>The entire education system should be reshaped to better assist social mobility rather than a narrow focus on academic selection, the Conservative former minister David Willetts has warned ahead of the government\u2019s publication of its plans for new grammar schools.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/12/social-mobility-education-working-class-aspiration\">If we\u2019re serious about social mobility, the education system must change | David Willetts</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The education secretary, Justine Greening, is to introduce a green paper in the Commons on Monday afternoon which is expected to unveil a new generation of grammar schools, as well as other measures including more community outreach by private schools.</p> <p>But Lord Willetts, the former universities minister and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/sep/07/former-tory-minister-grammar-schools-fail-disadvantaged-children\">a vocal critic </a>of the plan to remove a ban on new grammars in England, argues that social mobility is a much more complex issue, and needs a properly coherent response when it comes to education.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u201cWe need a social mobility strategy that includes all the stages of education, throughout our lives,\u201d he writes in an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/12/social-mobility-education-working-class-aspiration\">article for the Guardian</a>. \u201cIt has to include competitive pressures on schools to improve their performance \u2013 and not simply by selecting the kids who are going to do best.\u201d</p> <p>Greening\u2019s announcement is expected to set out more details of educational changes outlined last week in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/sep/09/grammar-schools-face-radical-expansion-says-theresa-may\">a speech by Theresa May</a>. The prime minister said a move to create more grammar schools heralded \u201ca future in which Britain\u2019s education system shifts decisively to support ordinary working-class families\u201d.</p> <p>In his article Willetts notes research showing that much of the social mobility seen during the era of mass school selection in the 1950s and 1960s was due to an increase in white-collar jobs, rather than grammar schools.</p> <p>\u201cBut when these trends slowed down the underlying problem was revealed more starkly,\u201d Willetts argues. In the modern era, he says, the interaction of the education system with changes in the job market \u201chas not been good for social mobility\u201d.</p> <p>He writes: \u201cThe decline of steady jobs in industry for school leavers and the expansion of higher education as the pre-eminent route to well-paid jobs has meant that the academic performance of your secondary school matters more than ever. </p> <p>\u201cThe shocking gap in school standards may not have widened but it certainly makes more of a difference to your life chances once the school\u2019s role becomes to provide a route to university. </p> <p>\u201cIt is the urgent need to get your child into the schools that get them into the prestigious universities that has led to the parental arms race which eventually feeds through into higher house prices around the primary schools that feed the secondary schools that feed the universities.\u201d</p> <p>Adding to the problem, Willetts argues, is the way the education system obliges children to specialise from 16, with little in the way of cohesive careers advice, while good apprenticeships are scarce.</p> <p>Some good examples exist, he argues, noting the rapid recent improvement in schools in London. \u201cThis has been achieved by putting schools under relentless pressure and not just allowing some to appear to do better by academic or social selection,\u201d he writes.</p> <p>While the government is expected to announce measures to avoid new grammar schools being disproportionately colonised by children from better-off backgrounds, as tends to happen with existing examples, May faces significant opposition to the plans.</p> <p>As well as Willetts, critics of the idea <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/sep/09/mays-grammar-school-plans-put-six-years-of-educational-progress-at-risk\">include Nicky Morgan</a>, the former education secretary, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/sep/05/michael-wilshaw-ofsted-chief-grammar-schools-theresa-may-poorer-children\">chief inspector of schools, Sir Michael Wilshaw</a>, and the government\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/sep/07/grammar-schools-expansion-disaster-social-mobility-tsar-alan-milburn\">social mobility tsar, Alan Milburn</a>. </p> <p>The plans are also opposed by Labour, the Liberal Democrats and the SNP, meaning May\u2019s working Commons <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/sep/09/tory-rebels-quash-theresa-mays-grammar-school-plans\">majority of 17 could be tested</a> if more Conservative MPs rebel.

  "<p>After treading a gilded path to his seventh US Open final, Novak Djokovic stumbled, literally, in sight of the prize as Stan Wawrinka found the strength and conviction to beat the world No1 in four pulsating sets \u2013 the last of them wreathed in controversy \u2013 on a warm September night.</p> <p>Patrick McEnroe, commentating in the ESPN box, shared the cynical displeasure of most onlookers when the defending champion, who appeared to be cramping, was granted a dubious medical timeout to have his toes tended to midway through the fourth set, shortly after being broken.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/10/novak-djokovic-trainer-use-stan-wawrinka-us-open-final\">Novak Djokovic pushes use of trainer to limit before US Open final</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It appeared to be a risible manipulation of the regulations, which say timeouts can only be taken for an \u201cacute medical condition that requires immediate attention\u201d. Wawrinka did not seem impressed, seeking assurance from the tournament referee, Brian Earley, that all was above board \u2013 and shooting his opponent a knowing glance.</p> <p>\u201cSorry, man,\u201d Djokovic said to Wawrinka. For what, one wondered? They had been playing for three hours and 23 minutes, by a distance Djokovic\u2019s longest match of the tournament.</p> <p>\u201cThat was another example of a complete abuse of the rules,\u201d said McEnroe. \u201cIt\u2019s up to the officials <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/10/novak-djokovic-trainer-use-stan-wawrinka-us-open-final\">to do something about it</a>, and they just don\u2019t have the guts to do it.\u201d</p> <p>Otherwise, the final was a minor classic. Wawrinka won his third major 6-7, 6-4, 7-5, 6-3 in just under four hours, with several passages of glorious tennis from both players.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening right now. Novak, you\u2019re a great champion,\u201d Wawrinka said after the match. \u201cWe know each other since many, many years. I had the chance to practise with him and play him in big matches. This is amazing. I came here not expecting to win it, but I was trying to win every match. I am completely empty. I had to bring everything today.\u201d</p> <p>Djokovic paid tribute to his opponent after the match. \u201cI cannot tell you that [about their exchange at the net]. It was a friendly chat. Congratulations Stan. You were the more courageous player in the decisive moment and you deserved to win this title. He was the better player, tougher mentally. It was a fantastic couple of weeks for me. I didn\u2019t know if I should come a few weeks before because I suffered physically.\u201d</p> <p>In the last 50 men\u2019s slams, only the Argentinian Juan Mart\u00edn del Potro here in the 2009 final, has broken the hegemony of the old world, as George Bush Jr used to call it \u2013 and, in another all-European final, Switzerland prevailed over Serbia. It was Wawrinka\u2019s first US Open, to go with titles in Melbourne and Paris, and his fifth victory in 23 matches against the world No1. Under the circumstances, it might have been the most satisfying.</p> <p>When Wawrinka beat Djokovic to win the French Open last year, he trusted his strong right arm, the one tattooed with Beckett\u2019s famous \u201cfail better\u201d quote. It did not click immediately there or here \u2013 but nor did it fail him when it mattered. After dropping the first set, he not only avoided embarrassment, he crushed the Serb to win. It was an extraordinary fightback.</p> <p>The heatwave finally broke, the lightest of zephyrs soothing the finalists\u2019 brows in ideal conditions, with the roof open and the court playing a little more quickly than in the humid conditions that had prevailed for much of the tournament.</p> <p>As at Roland Garros, Wawrinka started nervously, spraying shots everywhere, and Djokovic hit an ominous rhythm to go 3-0 up in under 10 minutes. But Wawrinka kept faith in his ground strokes, almost disregarding the circumstances. Where Ga\u00ebl Monfils had tried to rope-a-dope Djokovic in the semi-finals, Wawrinka was still going for the knockout.</p> <p>The champion inexplicably dropped his guard. A 134mph serve earned Wawrinka a tie-break after he had played much of the set on his heels, but Djokovic played some sublime shots to take the set in his ninth shootout win over Wawrinka in 10 such contests, this time giving up just a single point.</p> <p>He moved to the second set comfortable in the knowledge that he was 51-0 at this tournament after winning the first set. Yet there was something in the still, early evening air to suggest drama.</p> <p>As he did in Paris, Wawrinka drew that single-handed backhand from its scabbard and painted the deuce corner on his way to saving three break points for 3-1 up just under the hour. Djokovic prowled the baseline, breathing hard and looking as if he was enduring some sort of private hell. Perhaps he was. Tennis at this level is no picnic.</p> <p>The Swiss, whose serve has been such a weapon here, hit his fourth double fault, and was hanging on at 4-1.</p> <p>Djokovic broke back but gestured angrily towards Boris Becker and his team as Wawrinka held to love for 5-4. A blistering forehand down the line earned Wawrinka two set points in the 10<sup>th</sup> game. Djokovic saved one of them to win a tense rally with a deft volley, but he shoved a forehand wide and they were a set apiece.</p> <p>The world No1 smashed his racket to smithereens during the break. Who could blame him?</p> <p>Wawrinka saved three break points to hold at the start of the third after nearly two hours of tennis.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2d8c112bf1c9105408f07cb86ad59b98532006f9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2d8c112bf1c9105408f07cb86ad59b98532006f9/0_124_5184_3110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Stan Wawrinka and Novak Djokovic embrace at the end of their match at Flushing Meadows\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Stan Wawrinka and Novak Djokovic embrace at the end of their match at Flushing Meadows.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris Trotman/Getty Images for USTA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At about this point in his semi-final against Monfils, Djokovic was almost out on his feet in the oppressive heat and humidity. Still, he had played only eight hours and 58 minutes getting to the final, through 13 completed sets, because three of his six matches were incomplete due to a walkover and two retirements; Wawrinka endured nearly twice that: 17 hours and 54 minutes through 23 sets.</p> <p>Yet there was little between them in stamina and strength as each sought to win another two sets, preferably in a row. When the world No3 broke in the second game of the third set, the odds swung sharply in his favour. Djokovic knew he was in trouble. Bundled out early at Wimbledon when ambitions of a calendar slam were still alive, and hobbled since with injuries to wrist, elbow and both shoulders, the proudest of champions would not lie down, though. He broke back and after two-and-a-half hours, they were level again, a set each and 3-3.</p> <p>A quarter of an hour later, Djokovic held to love for the sixth time, to stay in the set, but his level dropped at 6-5 and a loose backhand gave Wawrinka set point. Djokovic sliced a backhand wide \u2013 and the noise level in the arena went rock-concert crazy.</p> <p>All tournament, Djokovic has had to receive treatment for some complaint or other. At 30-30 on his serve in the second game of the fourth set, he doubled up in pain after belting a forehand from deep, clutching at his groin. Two points later, Wawrinka broke him for 2-0.</p> <p>Wawrinka broke to love, but Djokovic did not immediately seek medical assistance before the fourth game, perhaps suspecting it was cramp that had cut him down \u2013 and that is not treatable, as it is considered a failure in condition. He was desperate and somehow fought through three deuce points to hold.</p> <p>Then the trainer emerged, Djokovic took off his shoes and asked for a callus to be clipped from under the big toe of his left foot, as well as a quick manicure of the toes on his right foot.</p> <p>Refreshed, Djokovic returned to the court, and was not moving like someone with tender feet. He grabbed his 16<sup>th</sup> and 17<sup>th</sup> break points \u2013 but could not reap a dividend. And there weren\u2019t too many people in the arena who had much sympathy with him. At the 2-5 changeover, the trainer re-emerged to treat Djokovic\u2019s feet again.</p> <p>He held, somehow, again moving with freedom, and went up two points as Wawrinka served for the title and his girlfriend, Donna Veki\u0107, could barely watch as he struggled to deuce. The Swiss won an epic rally to get to match point with a gentle dab, Djokovic sprawled on hands and knees at the back of the court \u2013 and Wawrinka raised his arms in triumph as his opponent\u2019s final shot drifted long.</p> <p>Djokovic was defensive later in explaining the timeouts. \u201cJust the toenails were off and bleeding. Yeah, it was quite painful to move around. You know, I tried.\u201d He added: \u201cThe toe just happened today. Some other injury that was, you know, very serious at the time. I really didn\u2019t know whether or not I\u2019m going to come, to be honest. Decided like eight, nine days before the start of the Open, just to try. To play finals, it\u2019s quite amazing.\u201d</p> <p>Asked if he were cramping in the final set, he replied. \u201cNo.\u201d</p> <p>Did he think it was fair to take it before Wawrinka\u2019s next serve? \u201cI was allowed, so I took it.\u201d Was he surprised? \u201cWhy would I be surprised if I was allowed?\u201d Because, it was pointed out, the rules stipulate a timeout was reserved for \u201can acute medical condition\u201d. He replied, \u201cIt was. I don\u2019t want to talk about this and you guys think I\u2019m finding excuses. It\u2019s just not necessary. I was allowed, so I took it.\u201d</p> <p>Asked if the rules should be looked at, given the suspicion that some players are abusing them, he said, \u201cWe\u2019ll talk about it, sure. If players bring that up to the table, you know. You know, I didn\u2019t have any I guess major complaints about that against me or me against any other player. If there are ... if this is a debate and players think there should be something changed in the rules, of course we are there to discuss. Will bring this up to the council soon I guess if this is a big deal.\u201d</p> <p>What a fortnight it has been. It began with Phil Collins, of Chiswick and Miami, singing In the Air Tonight (rather well), an apt choice to mark the opening of the new roof, and culminated before play on Sunday with Norm Lewis\u2019s rich baritone embracing the national anthem, after a moment of silence to mark the 15<sup>th</sup> anniversary of 9/11, as members of the <a href=\"http://www.marforres.marines.mil/Major-Subordinate-Commands/Force-Headquarters-Group/6th-Communication-Battalion/\">US Marine 6<sup>th</sup> Communications Battalion</a>, Brooklyn, drew the Stars and Stripes across the court.</p> <p>They do have a sense of occasion in this noisy old town, and they were rewarded with a final that had pretty much everything.</p>",

At times it almost seemed like Helen was guilty unless proved innocent. The best thing about the whole story line is that it's brought the whole issue of mental abuse and manipulation to the fore, and I hope people start to treat it more seriously in future.</p> <p>Just one niggling doubt remains in my mind, and that is that if the roles had been reversed and Helen had been the abuser and Rob the abused, and if he, in a fit of desperation had stabbed her, would he now be free or serving a prison sentence? Mental abuse (as opposed to physical abuse where there is a clear gender bias towards men being the main offenders by far) is an area where I think we have to be very careful to treat the sexes equally in every way.</p></div> </div> </div>  </figure>  <h2>\u2018I have found the storyline interesting and involving\u2019<br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-comment\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/sep/11/the-archers-verdict-on-helen-tichener-aired#comment-83067453\">  <div class=\"d2-comment-embedded\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Comment\"> <div class=\"d2-left-col\"> <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/12751436\" title=\"View Pam Crane\u2019s profile\"> <img class=\"d2-avatar\" src=\"https://avatar.guim.co.uk/user/12751436\" height=\"40\" width=\"40\" alt=\"User avatar for Pam Crane\"> </a> </div> <div class=\"d2-right-col\"> <div itemscope itemprop=\"author\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"> <a class=\"d2-username\" href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/12751436\" title=\"View Pam Crane\u2019s profile\" itemprop=\"url\"> <span itemprop=\"givenName\">Pam Crane</span> </a> </div> <div class=\"d2-permalink\"> <a class=\"d2-datetime\" href=\"https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/83067453\" title=\"Link to this comment\" itemprop=\"datePublished\">12 September 2016 8:19am</a> </div> <div class=\"d2-body\" itemprop=\"text\"><p>Good grief! How negative a lot of these comments are! I have found the story-line interesting and involving - and utterly unsurprised at the determination of the manipulative Rob to continue persecuting Helen. <br />I too would have like to hear how the jury turned the verdict around - presumably the penny dropped when the foreman 'came out' as a Rob clone! <br />I kept thinking of people I have known over the past 73 years, and how very close some have come to similar behaviour ... I'm glad so many women are being helped as a result of this drama. <br />Sad that there will always be a small proportion of men (and women - I have personally known one) who have to have total control over others while pretending to love them, and make their lives a misery.

However, I spend quite a bit of the time in the car and have been drawn into this plot by neglectfully not switching channels at the opening bars of that ridiculous theme music. Some of the details of this story lack credibility, such as Helen's non-defence, stretching over months and smack of faux dramatic tension; the crucible that was last nights jury room was laughable. Nevertheless, I think on balance it's been exciting, engaging and has shone a light on a significant social issue. I think the team let themselves down with their presentation of the trial (not just last nights episode). Those who think that the Archers has become to Eastenders are mistaken. I can't stand soaps but recognise that TV people do this sort of thing much more effectively. In fact I'd like to see Radio 4 import some TV talent, not to sex it up but because they can tell a better story. I might even keep listening.</p></div> </div> </div>  </figure>  <h2>\u2018Perhaps this issue will now get the attention it deserves\u2019<br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-comment\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/sep/11/the-archers-verdict-on-helen-tichener-aired#comment-83072335\">  <div class=\"d2-comment-embedded\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Comment\"> <div class=\"d2-left-col\"> <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/12177269\" title=\"View PDT1952\u2019s profile\"> <img class=\"d2-avatar\" src=\"https://avatar.guim.co.uk/user/12177269\" height=\"40\" width=\"40\" alt=\"User avatar for PDT1952\"> </a> </div> <div class=\"d2-right-col\"> <div itemscope itemprop=\"author\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"> <a class=\"d2-username\" href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/12177269\" title=\"View PDT1952\u2019s profile\" itemprop=\"url\"> <span itemprop=\"givenName\">PDT1952</span> </a> </div> <div class=\"d2-permalink\"> <a class=\"d2-datetime\" href=\"https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/83072335\" title=\"Link to this comment\" itemprop=\"datePublished\">12 September 2016 9:35am</a> </div> <div class=\"d2-body\" itemprop=\"text\"><p>I have a close personal friend who was the victim of domestic abuse who went on to run a refuge for abused women for many years. Although she could not discuss individual cases, what I did learn is how common this type of abuse is, how terrified the women who escaped their abusers were that they would be found.</p> <p>My friend who is not really an Archers fan was quite concerned that this storyline could set the cause of abused women back a long way if the verdict was &quot;Guilty&quot;</p> <p>There are complaints here about how far up the programme schedule of the Today programme this story was, well done Today! This is an issue that has long been avoided and like the whole Saville affair now it is more in the light, perhaps it will get the attention it deserves.<br />I would think that Women's Aid are grateful for any media coverage of this issue.</p> <p>If their contention about the number of abused women out there is true, it is a sobering thought that there almost certainly will be both victims and perpetrators of abuse on this comment page.</p> <p>So yes it's not an Archer's story in a very narrow view of things, but if the programme had remained unchanged for the last 65 years, there would be people here saying that the Archers is an irrelevance and should be cancelled.</p> <p>As a final point I have male acquaintances who have been abused by women and that is an issue that receives absolutely no coverage, after all how many men would admit to that to their friends?</p></div> </div> </div>  </figure>",
  "<h2>What is the aim of the deal?</h2> <p>To bring a sustainable peace to war that has raged insatiably for five years and shows little sign of slowing. Syria\u2019s war has become especially complex and destructive and could stay that way for many years yet. The effect outside Syria\u2019s borders, of refugees and the creep of global terror, continues to raise the stakes.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/12/life-saving-un-aid-regularly-fails-reach-besieged-syrians\">Lifesaving UN aid regularly fails to reach besieged Syrians</a> </p> </aside>  <p>One concern for everyone involved has been the gradual blending of extremist groups among the mainstream anti-Assad rebels. The deal aims to disentangle this, isolating the extremists and providing aid to other groups. Russia and the US say this will ensure the mainstream groups are not bombed. For the first 48 hours, fighting was meant to stop in areas held by non-extremists and aid was supposed to be delivered to cities under siege.</p> <h2>Has the ceasefire worked so far?</h2> <p>Violence has dropped markedly across the country. Air strikes in particular have stopped, and the streets of Idlib, Damascus and Aleppo are now busier than for many months. However, aid deliveries, which were a key component of the plan, have not been allowed into opposition-held east Aleppo. Syrian troops have blocked UN trucks from entering the only access road. Syrian officials say all aid runs should be co-ordinated through Damascus. This is in contravention to the Russian/US deal. By Friday, Russia said that Syrian troops had moved back from the only access route, the Castello Road. The US said it could not confirm this. A continued hold-up in aid will put serious stress on the deal.</p> <h2>Why did it take so long to broker?</h2> <p>Trust has been impossible to build. Every previous multilateral attempt at a ceasefire has failed. Neither side has been willing to share power. The Syrian regime has preferred starvation sieges and widespread bombing of civilian areas to negotiations. The opposition has been unable to put forward a credible political alternative to rule Syria and failed to press home its early battlefield gains. Meanwhile, the goals of the foreign stakeholders in the conflict \u2013 Turkey, Russia, Iran, Saudi Arabia and the US \u2013 are mostly in competition with each other.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/09/syria-zip/giv-22601SFKP0dIYo8d3/\" data-alt=\"Syria control\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/09/syria-zip/giv-22601SFKP0dIYo8d3/\">Syria control</a> </figure>  <h2>Has it proven difficult to implement?</h2> <p>Russia and the US have had next to no common ground since Vladimir Putin sent his air force to prop up Assad in September 2015. The year since has seen Russia largely aim its firepower at opposition units, including US-vetted groups. It has at times also attacked Jabhat al-Nusra (which renamed itself Jabhat Fatah al-Sham after it announced a split from al-Qaida) and Isis.</p> <p>Russia\u2019s aim has been to ensure that Assad cannot lose and to give the Syrian leader an advantage in subsequent negotiations. The US, meanwhile, has eschewed a lead role in the war, confining its involvement to defeating Isis in north-eastern Syria, using Kurdish forces as a proxy infantry supported by its air force.</p> <p>Opposition groups are deeply sceptical of the deal. They say that neither superpower has acted in good faith. And they believe it favours Assad. Ousting the jihadis among them means giving up a layer of security that they don\u2019t believe will be filled by either side.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/11/syrian-people-of-aleppo-prepare-for-eid-under-siege\">People of Aleppo prepare for Eid festival under siege</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>What does each side want?</h2> <p>The US has been pushing for far greater humanitarian aid into areas besieged by the Syrian regime, as well as a stop to the bombing. Aleppo and parts of Damascus are central to this. Russia says it is willing to spare non-extremist opposition groups, but wants to know where they are. A joint US/Russian operation is central to determining future targets and Russia has said it will rein in the Syrian air force. If calm persists, Moscow says moves could be made to a political transition, the form of which is not yet clear.</p> <p>The opposition insists that civilian areas, which have been systematically targeted across much of the country, be spared, and that sieges of up to 18 rebel areas be lifted.</p> <h2>Is the ceasefire a path to a viable solution?</h2> <p>No political path is yet apparent, and this is another criticism of the deal. However, the ceasefire is being pitched as a trust-building measure, a necessary step before ways to put an end to the crisis can be meaningfully discussed. Previous summits in Geneva, where the Kerry/Lavrov pact was announced, have ended in spectacular failure. If the protagonists start to believe that outright victory is impossible, then there may be breathing space for negotiations. If the ceasefire holds, it could force that realisation. Therein lies its purpose.</p> <p><br></p> <p><br></p> <p><br></p> <p><br></p> <p><br></p> <p><br></p> <p><br></p> <p><br tabindex=\"-1\"></p>",

  "<p>In many American cities, finding elevated lead levels in drinking water is enough to spark serious concern. But in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, where many residents are delivered expensive, rust-colored and corrosive water, it\u2019s just one of many of complaints. </p> <p>On just one street, a pregnant 19-year-old and a Vietnam veteran said they no longer drink the tap water.

In 20 years, the organization lost 13 executive directors, three financial officers, and five engineering directors, according to a copy of the report obtained by the Guardian.</p> <p>In 2008, PWSA borrowed more than $400m in variable rate bonds just as the market collapsed. This year, debt payments alone accounted for 44% of the authority\u2019s operating budget.</p> <p>By 2010, the water agency was struggling with what seemed like an invasion of cancer-causing chemicals called trihalomethanes, formed when salty fracking wastewater came into contact with treated drinking water.</p> <p>In an effort to reduce brominated trihalomethanes, the PWSA dropped chlorine levels, one of several factors Stanley States, the director of water quality at PWSA until 2014, believes led to increased lead levels.</p> <p>In 2012, the struggling agency brought in <a href=\"http://www.post-gazette.com/business/businessnews/2013/07/05/Veolia-produces-savings-cultural-shift-at-Pittsburgh-water-authority/stories/201307050130\">Veolia North America</a>, a French corporation, to manage the city\u2019s water supply. The same company <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/22/michigan-flint-water-crisis-lockwood-andrews-newnam-veolia\">is being sued in Michigan</a> for allegedly failing to warn officials about lead risks to <a href=\"http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3100434-JG-Veolia-Flint-Bid-2015.html\">Flint\u2019s water</a>.</p> <p>After <a href=\"http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3100433-JG-Veolia-Bid-PWSA-July-2012.html\">Veolia took over</a> management of the city\u2019s water, the chemical used to control corrosion of metals, such as lead, was changed. Typically, it takes months for a water department to change corrosion control methods, because <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3100425-JG-PWSA-Emails-John-Quigly.html\">changes can cause lead spikes</a>. Feasibility studies must be conducted, rounds of testing completed, state agencies notified and their approval sought.</p> <p>Instead, PWSA changed the corrosion control to save money in <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3100421-JG-Notice-of-Violation-PWSA.html\">violation of state law</a>, <a href=\"http://files.dep.state.pa.us/PublicParticipation/Public%20Participation%20Center/PubPartCenterPortalFiles/DEPWebinars/Water/DEP%20Webinar%20on%20Pittsburgh%20Water-20160425%201800-1.mp4\">state authorities said</a> (pdf).

Veolia denies responsibility.</p> <p>\u201cVeolia did not and would not prioritize cost savings ahead of effective corrosion control methods,\u201d said Karole Colangelo, a spokeswoman for the company. Veolia had left Pittsburgh by April 2016.</p> <p>At the same time, rates for water in the city rose precipitously. In 2013, the board approved a 20% hike <a href=\"http://www.pgh2o.com/rates\">over four years</a>, putting the <a href=\"http://www.post-gazette.com/local/city/2013/10/12/Pittsburgh-water-authority-sets-4-year-rate-hikes/stories/201310120025\">average residential water bill of 4,000 gallons at $50.32 a month</a> by 2017, according to the Post-Gazette. That would make Pittsburgh\u2019s water more than triple the average midwest cost, based on figures from 2015 provided by the American Water Works Association.</p> <p>By 2015, much of Veolia\u2019s tenure in the city had been marred by persistent billing issues related to new water meters. Up to <a href=\"http://triblive.com/news/allegheny/10142854-74/pwsa-billing-donahoe\">50,000 erroneous bills</a> were issued as a result of Veolia\u2019s attempted updates to 77,000 water meters.</p> <p>A <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3100427-JG-PWSA-Lawsuit-Complaint.html\">class action lawsuit</a> cited a <a href=\"http://www.post-gazette.com/local/city/2015/05/26/Millvale-resident-files-suit-against-Pittsburgh-Water-and-Sewer-Authority-over-meter-problems/stories/201505260132\">$2,300 bill for a vacant property</a> which already had water off, while University of Pittsburgh Medical Center allegedly <a href=\"http://www.wtae.com/investigations/big-water-customers-owe-millions-in-delinquent-bills/36282202\">owed more than $436,000</a>.

He earned <a href=\"http://https//www.documentcloud.org/documents/3100418-JG-James-Good-Employment-Agreement-PWSA.html\">$240,000 a year</a> with generous benefits.</p> <p>The announcement about the corrosion control change apparently caught even Good by surprise, who said in a public meeting that \u201cI guess we were further along than I thought,\u201d according to the <a href=\"http://triblive.com/news/allegheny/9844246-74/lead-pwsa-soda\">Tribune-Review</a>.</p> <h2>Legal violations emerge</h2> <p>Unlike in Flint, Michigan, where sudden changes in water chemistry caused a spike, lead levels in Pittsburgh\u2019s tap water rose steadily for 12 years, alongside cancer-causing chemicals from fracking waste. </p> <p>By 2013, 14.8 parts per billion of lead were found in tap water, teetering on the edge of the federal limit of 15 parts per billion.That level is meant to warn water authorities that methods to control pipe corrosion are not working. Pittsburgh blew past 15 parts per billion in its most recent tests. </p> <p>There is no safe level of lead. In childhood, exposure diminishes IQ and can lead to behavioral and developmental problems. Federal limits for lead in drinking water are based only on water chemistry. </p> <p>In fact, some of the most pioneering lead research in the country was conducted in Pittsburgh, where Dr Herbert Needleman x-rayed the bones of 212 boys, and found that those with higher lead measurements, \u201cexhibited more delinquent, aggressive, internalizing, and externalizing behavior than otherwise similar boys\u201d, according to a <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=7&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj4yYL4-v3OAhXFkx4KHXgIDVoQFghSMAY&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fscholar.harvard.edu%2Ffiles%2Fjfeigenbaum%2Ffiles%2Ffeigenbaum_muller_lead_crime.pdf&amp;usg=AFQjCNHDBHU55GvWK_WxUF3JldxQsj7lsA&amp;sig2=ykrXZ8uuGzX1eBzG3K04dA&amp;bvm=bv.131783435,d.dmo\">recent paper by Harvard economist James Feigenbaum</a> (pdf).</p> <p>Allegheny County, of which Pittsburgh is the seat, still has some of the highest reported rates of elevated lead levels in Pennsylvania.

The remainder were lower-risk homes. In 2012, local news station <a href=\"http://www.wtae.com/investigations/Is-your-water-being-properly-tested-for-lead/12543822\">WTAE</a> found that 40 out of 50 test sites belonged to water department employees, and were concentrated in two neighborhoods. </p> <p>States, the former water quality director at PWSA, said despite lackluster testing in Pittsburgh, his department was not trying to flout regulations.</p> <p>\u201cI would have liked 30 years ago to take all the lead service lines out,\u201d said States, adding that he believed water departments should stop \u201cMickey mousing around\u201d with trying to control lead with chemicals. </p> <p>But under his leadership, Pittsburgh also failed to test the required number of high-risk homes for lead, and said he felt \u201cI\u2019d have been fired\u201d if Pittsburgh exceeded federal limits for lead. </p> <p>Now that lead levels exceeded federal limits in Pittsburgh, the PWSA is required to <a href=\"http://publicsource.org/investigations/pittsburgh-has-replace-some-lead-water-lines-authorities-have-find-them-first#.V8neAJMYii4\">replace lead service lines</a>.</p> <p>Problematically, the piecemeal approach undertaken by the water department can cause lead spikes too. The city began replacing parts of lead service lines, known as a partial replacement. Some experts believe the practice should be banned, and similar line replacements are now the subject of class action lawsuits in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jun/03/water-lead-testing-cheats-philadelphia-flint-crisis\">Chicago and Philadelphia</a>. Pittsburgh has already performed 99 such replacements.</p> <p>\u201cThey are over the lead action level now, even after re-implementing corrosion control \u2013 and it is anyone\u2019s guess how bad lead levels were before switching back,\u201d said Virginia Tech professor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/apr/27/michigan-employees-manipulate-water-samples-lead-testing\">Marc Edwards, who helped uncover the lead crisis in Flint</a>. </p> <p>\u201cOver the last year, the Pennsylvania DEP has repeatedly understated lead-in-water risks, and they have also defended test methods throughout the state that can hide high lead in water levels,\u201d he said, referring to how the state allowed use of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jun/03/water-lead-testing-cheats-philadelphia-flint-crisis\">discredited testing methods</a>. \u201cIt appears Pennsylvania residents will have to look elsewhere for honest answers \u2013 just like residents in Flint last year.\u201d</p> <p>State regulators told the Guardian: \u201cDEP continues to work with PWSA to determine the effects of the switch to pipeline infrastructure.\u201d </p> <p>\u201cResidents, especially those in older homes, are strongly encouraged to take simple steps to reduce possible lead in their drinking water: run the tap and use cold water for cooking/baby formula prep,\u201d regulators said. </p> <h2>Brown water persists</h2> <p>For some residents, warnings of elevated lead levels came alongside a new phenomenon: brown water. </p> <p>\u201cEverything we do filtered, even brushing my teeth I do with bottled water,\u201d said a resident who did not want to be named, because she works in public service. \u201cI\u2019m using bottled water to brush my teeth.\u201d She has lived in the neighborhood 26 years.

And that may be all they know. Binyon wrote a number of war poems: these, and much of his other work, have been a casualty of one poem\u2019s massive public success, and faded into occasionally anthologised obscurity. I\u2019d read and admired The Burning of the Leaves, and little else. <a href=\"http://themargins.net/anth/1930-1939/binyonmiyajima.html\">So I was pleased to find a trail leading east</a> and to discover an interesting little cache of \u201cJapanese\u201d poems by Binyon, Matsushima among them.</p> <p> The Japanese poems are included in a late work, the 1941 collection<em> </em>The North Star and Other Poems. Binyon wasn\u2019t an Orientalist in the derogatory current sense of the term. His interest in Japan was grounded in professionalism, travel and study. He had a long, distinguished career at the British Museum, specialising in Japanese and Chinese art, and his 1908 monograph, <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/paintinginthefar001804mbp\">Painting in the Far East</a>, was the first on the subject to have been written in a European language. His studies facilitated the discoveries of younger poets, including Ezra Pound. </p> <p> Matsushima is an exuberant celebration of place, 16 flowing hexameter lines inspired by the 280 or so pine-clad islands that constitute one of the famous \u201c<a href=\"http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2250.html\">three views of Japan.</a>\u201d The poem puts the romantic Binyon at the helm, and leaves the sober scholar on the shore. </p> <p> The first quatrain\u2019s itinerary begins with a stunningly contrasted visual first impression (\u201cDark pines on scarps that flame white in a mirrored sky\u201d). As the apostrophe to the \u201cparadise of waters and of isles that gleam\u201d develops over the third and fourth lines, the syntax becomes a bit wayward. \u201cFor them that with the wind glide by\u201d is a subordinate clause better said than read. It sounds fine, and the impersonality of \u201cthem\u201d widens the impressionistic ripples. Their view of the islands may be from the vantage point of travellers on a leisurely boat-trip, or of birds or clouds. Float along with the gaze of the poem, and don\u2019t worry \u2013 the syntax here is nowhere as complicated as it is to become.</p> <p> The next 12 lines bring the poem to its climax and conclusion in a single magnificent sentence. Binyon\u2019s speaker wants simply to tell us that the isles of Matsushima are his idea of absolute paradise. No palaces or gardens imagined by \u201cother\u2019s men\u2019s hearts\u201d as reconstructions of \u201clost happiness\u201d can compete. This is the romantic view in a nutshell: the rugged and natural bring us nearer to sublimity than the man-made, although \u201csublimity\u201d is perhaps too big a word. Binyon is not pursuing intimations of the divine in nature. Yet he still seems to be gently arguing with the conventions of paradise as established by the major religions (<a href=\"http://www.swedenborg.org.uk/emanuel_swedenborg\">Swedenborg</a>\u2019s sometimes urban heavens might be implicated, too). Here is a poet in old age, celebrating the Earth and its gorgeousness, strangeness and energy. The sea is especially significant. These waters offer \u201cno languid lake\u2019s caress\u201d. It\u2019s the live, salt tides that thrill him, suggesting a sensibility in common with John Masefield. Above all, this is Binyon\u2019s personal ideal of paradise: it\u2019s how he imagines eternity, (\u201cTo sail and ever sail\u201d).</p> <p> So the reader sets off on the leisurely, winding cruise of an island-dappled sentence, its qualifiers and inversions enough to induce mild seasickness. Hexameters benefit from long, involved sentences, though: such syntax minimises the effect of that distracting jolt, the mid-line caesura. Synaesthetic mismatch adds a sense of delirious abandon: there are those hearts that have imaginations, the \u201cgardens of scented song\u201d, the sounds that may be felt, and a silence almost made visual when described as \u201cvivid\u201d. </p> <p> Binyon rocks the grammatical boat in his excitement but keeps afloat and finally completes what at first sounds like a round trip, back to the first line. It\u2019s not quite the same, though, and there\u2019s a complication. The last line\u2019s \u201cparadise of isles\u201d may be Matsushima itself, a paradise consisting of islands. It\u2019s also possible that Binyon\u2019s boat is now moored on a specific paradise island, the most paradisaical. Either way, the recapitulation works well. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2016/aug/22/poem-of-the-week-my-mothers-language-by-abdellatif-laabi\">Poem of the week: My Mother\u2019s Language by Abdellatif La\u00e2bi</a> </p> </aside>  <p> Critical writing about Binyon\u2019s poetry sometimes has a superior ring. Binyon is no Hopkins, true, but he\u2019s more than a conservative Edwardian versifier. He can be odd and striking. The poems may be fluidly structured within formal limits, unusually sensuous, evocative in sound. Like the waters around the Matsushima islands, they are laced with currents of \u201clive sea\u201d. </p>",

On the other hand, she had just tried to sound authoritative by volunteering her plans to visit her French counterpart, and you might imagine that in the process of agreeing such a plan his identity (Jean-Marc Ayrault, but you knew that already) might have arisen.</p> <p>It\u2019s certainly fairer game than the other style of political gotcha query, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/shortcuts/2012/jul/11/how-much-pint-milk-ask-wife\" title=\"\">pint-of-milk test</a> (no idea because I hate hot drinks and cereal, but a Diet Coke is 60p at the corner shop, if that\u2019s any use to you), which supposedly has all ministers swotting up furiously on briefing documents of \u201cordinary person\u201d information any time they\u2019re going on the air. They plainly aren\u2019t ordinary people, and anyone who manages to be one when wrestling with a ministerial red box probably isn\u2019t doing their job properly.

The problem with Thornberry\u2019s response was not her ignorance but the way in which she dealt with it; by accusing Murnaghan of sexism instead of good-humouredly batting the question away with a joke about having misplaced her cheat sheet, or something, she made it significantly more interesting, and instantly multiplied its shelf life as a story on a quiet Sunday morning.

If you can\u2019t survive this nonsense, how well can we possibly expect you to handle the important stuff?</p> <p>Even so. Cock-up though it was, I feel extremely sorry for Thornberry, and all politicians, this morning. Imagine it: walking down the street, on your way to buy a pint of the proverbial, in the certain knowledge that at any moment some twerp with a smartphone could stick his camera in your face and demand to know the name of your favourite Adele song, or the capital of Slovakia.

  "<p>The riveting plot in The Archers got plenty of coverage in newspapers on Sunday and today. Editors were aware that the drama of Helen Titchener\u2019s trial for stabbing her abusive husband, Rob, had caught the public imagination.</p> <p>Well, that segment of the public that listens to BBC Radio 4 and also reads the quality and middle-market press. </p> <p>So the outcome of the unprecedented hour-long episode of the show - the jury\u2019s decision to acquit Helen of attempting to murder Rob - got plenty of headlines.</p> <p>Both the Guardian and the Daily Telegraph gave it front page slots, \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/sep/11/the-archers-verdict-on-helen-tichener-aired\">Helen not guilty in in Archers drama that gripped listeners</a>\u201d and \u201c<a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/09/11/the-nation-breathes-a-sigh-of-relief-as-the-archers-helen-titche/\">Nation breathes sigh of relief as Helen Archer is found not guilty</a>\u201d respectively. </p> <p>The Times featured it <a href=\"http://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/news/helen-not-guilty-in-archers-trial-that-gripped-nation-7djmxbqtx\">on page 3</a>, as did the Daily Mail, with a triumphant \u201c<a href=\"http://www.nla-clipshare.com/#/browse/article/print/wordcount/DML/20160912/01/null/null/3/0\">Not guilty!</a>\u201d headline. And the Daily Express realised its significance too with a page 5 lead, \u201c<a href=\"http://www.express.co.uk/showbiz/tv-radio/709570/The-Archers-trial-Helen-Titchener-not-guilty-Rob-Titchener\">5m hear jury of stars clear Archers\u2019 Helen</a>\u201d.</p> <p>Newspapers caught on to the plot some time ago and there have been occasional articles plus the odd spin-off feature about domineering husbands.</p> <p>But, as the Archers\u2019 editor, Sean O\u2019Connor, pointed out in a Today programme interview, newspapers have been playing catch-up ever since the plot began.</p> <p>Concern about the way Rob was treating Helen was initially expressed on social media and then, as the twists and turns unfolded, more and more people took to Twitter and Facebook to register their views, or simply to record what had happened.</p> <p>Asked whether he had any sense that it would take off, O\u2019Connor said: \u201cWe knew it would be quite big. What we didn\u2019t realise was that social media was so powerful.\u201d</p> <p>In other words, it was the audience that made it into a success with their online chatter about the issues raised by the way in which Rob gradually sought to control his wife. Result: record-breaking listening figures over the past week during the trial and the verdict.</p> <p>Here was a radio soap opera, a fiction, willing to spend the best part of three years dealing with a serious subject, drawn from real life, and discovering that it had hit a nerve. </p> <p>Moreover, it was the immediacy of social media that stimuated interest in the output of a traditional medium, radio. That\u2019s 21st century media synergy for you.</p> <p>And it continues. As the Today interviewer said excitedly, \u201cHelen is still trending on Twitter.\u201d It had produced an amazing response, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/sep/11/the-archers-verdict-on-helen-titchener-lights-up-social-media\">as the Guardian also reported</a>.</p> <p>O\u2019Connor told of a transformational moment in the relationship between old and new media. A relatively tiny scene, in which Rob persuaded Helen to change her dress (because he thought her own choice too provocative), caught listeners\u2019 imagination.</p> <p>They took to social media and the Archers\u2019 team realised, as O\u2019Connor put it, that the audience had not only caught on, but were \u201cquite far ahead of us.\u201d </p> <p>Awareness of the public conversation, undoubtedly affected the writing of the plot and the amount of time O\u2019Connor was prepared to devote to it.</p> <p>The Archers, originally billed as \u201can everyday story of country folk\u201d, had lived up to its millennial change of description: \u201ca contemporary drama in a rural setting\u201d.</p> <p>Two newspaper commentators registered their appreciation. Allison Pearson, in the Telegraph, recalled the way in which the jailing of Coronation Street\u2019s Deirdre Barlow in 1998 also fascinated the public and blurred the boundary between fiction and real life.</p> <p>She wrote: \u201cThose of us who had listened for months as Rob stole Helen\u2019s sense of self, who had come to understand the insidious crime of coercive control (not introduced till 2015) knew that she was innocent, but would the jury?\u201d</p> <p>And when they did, observed Pearson, \u201cthere was such a sigh of relief across the land that trees swayed and hearts leapt with gladness.\u201d</p> <p>In the Mail, Brian Viner noted that \u201c<a href=\"http://www.nla-clipshare.com/#/browse/article/print/wordcount/DML/20160912/01/null/null/3/1\">his wife didn\u2019t regain her equilibrium until halfway through Poldark\u201d</a> following the Archers almost two hours before. </p> <p>He thought some of the social media stuff that abused the actor playing Rob, Timothy Watson, had been silly, and other material had been divisive. But, he concluded, \u201cHelen is free, that\u2019s the main thing\u201d.</p> <p>If you want a left-field - in fact, far-right field - take on the Archers, then try this Express nonsense, \u201c<a href=\"http://www.express.co.uk/showbiz/tv-radio/709596/The-Archers-trial-Brexit-Helen-Titchener-Rob-Titchener\">Fans slam \u2018constant Brexit analogies\u2019 as Helen Titchener walks free</a>\u201d. </p>",

For despite struggling to paw or claw meekly at his opponent, he somehow retained enough rugged bloody-mindedness to stay upright as howitzers rattled into his skin and shattered bone.</p> <p>His defiance brought to mind the American essayist AJ Liebling\u2019s description of the final moments of Randolph Turpin\u2019s defeat by Sugar Ray Robinson, in their world middleweight title rematch exactly 65 years ago today. As Turpin took a \u201csuccession of smashing hits such as I had never seen a fighter take without falling down\u201d, Liebling gazed into his \u201csad face \u2026 a face of a schoolboy who has long trained himself not to cry under punishment, and who has had endless chances to practise\u201d. His words retain a universal truth, even generations on.</p> <p>I have been thinking about Turpin recently and not only because of the anniversary of his rematch with Robinson.

Dick, the older of his two elder brothers, became the first black fighter to win a title under British Board of Control rules but Randolph was even better, blasting his way through domestic and European opposition before dominating Robinson over 15 rounds to become world champion at 23. At the time the US radio commentator Stan Lomax hailed it as boxing\u2019s biggest upset since Jack Dempsey lost his heavyweight title to Gene Tunney 25 years earlier.</p> <p>At a civic reception afterwards a jet fighter performed loops over the town hall and 20,000 turned up to sing \u201cFor he\u2019s a jolly good fellow\u201d. Yet a series of familiar vices, including Casanova-scale womanising and increasing ill-discipline, ensured Turpin never hit those heights again. And while he was still good enough to add the British and Empire light-heavyweight title to his r\u00e9sum\u00e9, another world title was to elude him after he barely trained for a fight with Bobo Olson and lost a winnable fight on points. As the New York Post writer Jimmy Cannon put it: \u201cIt was as though Turpin thought the ropes were a perpendicular hammock where he might loll in brief tranquility. Consequently he would rest against them, his aching head straining backwards on the cords of his neck as though he were trying to locate an invisible pillow.\u201d Outside the ring Turpin\u2019s life became more turbulent. He admitted slapping his first wife \u201cthree or four times\u201d because she had shouted at him. He faced trial for rape and assault in Harlem \u2013 a settlement was reached \u2013 and despite winning \u00a3300,000 during his career he ended up broke and owing the taxman thousands. He ended up committing suicide at 37, having written a parting note in front of his wife and kids that morning. His doctor suspected he had brain damage from fighting.</p> <p>But make no mistake, he could fight. My grandfather, Jimmy Ingle, had first-hand experience of Turpin\u2019s power. He was good enough to be the first Irishman to become European amateur champion at the age of 17, after which he sparred with the three-weight world champion Henry Armstrong and was approached by Tunney to manage him in America. He was good enough, too, to hold the British welterweight and middleweight champion Ernie Roderick to a draw.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/11/kell-brook-eye-socket-surgery-gennady-golovkin-defeat-dominic-ingle-towel\">Kell Brook to undergo surgery on broken eye socket after defeat by Golovkin</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Facing Turpin, in front of 10,000 people in Coventry, was a different matter. \u201cThe fight lasted three rounds,\u201d he later wrote. \u201cAfterwards I could only recall the first minute. A right-hand punch exploded on my chin and for the remainder of the bout I boxed only from instinct. Later my trainer told me I was down for three counts of nine in every round and that the referee had stopped it at the end of round three. He was a ghost with a hammer.\u201d</p> <p>Something else struck me re-reading Liebling\u2019s classic work, The Sweet Science: the description of Turpin\u2019s power punches, fired in \u201calways at some curious angle\u201d. As he put it: \u201cOne punch for the body looked like a man releasing a bowling ball; another a right-hand for the head, was like a granny boxing a boy\u2019s ears. He might be one of the hardest hitters in history. Turpin was so strong that his unconventional blows shook Robinson when they landed, although Robinson knew that, according to the book, they shouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>He was referring to the fighter once known as the Leamington Licker but his words eerily describe Golovkin\u2019s stun-gun fists, spraying punches from all angles, sending his opponents \u2013 and everyone watching \u2013 dizzy.</p>",

  "<p>Anyone buying a secondhand car privately is in danger of having it repossessed without warning by finance companies under \u201carchaic\u201d Victorian legislation, the Law Commission has warned.</p> <p>The number of so-called logbook loans, which allow owners to borrow money using their car as collateral, has soared over the past decade.</p> <p>Consumers should be protected from the risk of losing vehicles by a new goods mortgages act to replace the outdated laws, according to the legal reform body.</p> <p>The loans are regulated by the 1878 Bills of Sale Act and the 1882 Bills of Sale Act (1878) Amendment Act.</p> <p>Logbook loans have to be registered at the high court, but those buying cars privately are unlikely to be able to check whether the vehicle is subject to such an order. If the original owner ceases payments, the car can be repossessed by the lender.</p> <p>The use of bills of sale, which allow people to use goods that they own as security, increased from less than 3,000 in 2001 to more than 37,000 in 2015, the Law Commission said. They are now mostly utilised for logbook loans.</p> <p>Stephen Lewis, the law commissioner for commercial and common law, said: \u201cBorrowers are increasingly turning to logbook loans to raise cash, but many who default rapidly find themselves out of pocket and their vehicle repossessed. People buying secondhand vehicles understandably expect the law to protect them, but it is out of date and out of step with other consumer legislation.</p> <p>\u201cIt is high time the law was reformed to bring protections to logbook loan borrowers and the unwitting purchasers who, in all good faith, buy secondhand vehicles that are still subject to these widely used and unfair loans.\u201d</p> <p>In one case highlighted by Citizens Advice, a customer bought a van advertised on Auto Trader that went missing shortly afterwards. It was reported as stolen, but police informed the purchaser that the vehicle had been repossessed because it had a logbook loan taken out by the previous owner. The client lost their money.</p> <p>The Law Commission recommended that borrowers and buyers should be given similar protections to those offered by hire purchase law. That would involve borrowers being given more time to pay.</p> <p>Any person temporarily unable to pay, who has repaid more than one-third of the loan, should be able to stop lenders repossessing the vehicle without a court order, the commission has proposed. Those who cannot make any more payments should have the right to hand the car back to the lender, ending their liability for the remainder of the loan.</p> <p>Under the recommendations, secondhand vehicle buyers who act in good faith, without knowing that their purchases are subject to a logbook loan, would not be liable for the repayments.</p>",

  "<p>Sixteen years ago, British researcher Ewan Birney launched an unusual sweepstake. At the time, scientists were completing the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/human-genome-project\" title=\"\">Human Genome Project</a>, the international effort to unravel the genetic makeup of human beings. But how many individual human genes would be revealed when the project was completed, Birney wondered? So he asked the world\u2019s top geneticists to each bet a dollar on the outcome.</p> <p>This might have seemed a rather tardy question, given that the project had already consumed \u201cthe best part of a decade, the invention of brand new technologies, unprecedented computing power and $3bn\u201d, as Adam Rutherford notes. Late or not, Birney\u2019s query nevertheless produced a striking answer.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/mar/19/do-your-genes-determine-your-entire-life\">Do your genes determine your entire life? | Julian Baggini</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A total of 460 geneticists \u2013 including several Nobel winners \u2013 stepped up to make their predictions. Some believed the project would show humans have up to 250,000 genes. After all, we are extraordinarily complex creatures, it was argued. Surely we must have a huge number of genes to control the manufacture of the proteins from which our densely connected neural circuits are made. Other researchers stuck at around 150,000 while most plumped for a figure above 70,000. Birney chose 48,000. The lowest guess, by US geneticist Lee Rowen, was 25,947.</p> <p>Then, in 2003, the Human Genome Project revealed the true figure. We have about 20,000 genes. \u201cThe best experts in the world were all mistaken,\u201d writes Rutherford. \u201cAnd they were not just a little bit out.\u201d Our much-vaunted understanding of how DNA rules our bodies, minds and lives, gleaned in the latter half of the 20th century, was shown to rest on rather shaky intellectual ground.</p> <p>Humans turn out to have fewer genes than a roundworm. Or a banana. Or a grain of rice. Yet scientists had no inkling our complement of genes was so meagre. As Rutherford notes: \u201cThe greatest achievement of the Human Genome Project was working out exactly how little we knew.\u201d</p> <p>It is a neat phrase and typical of this elegant, informed account of the lessons we are still learning from the project. This is no bombastic view of a world transformed by modern genetics or a health service revolutionised by gene-based therapies. More than anything, this is a book that highlights the limits of what genes can tell about us or do for us. Yes, they have helped us understand the causes of diseases. \u201cBut the number of diseases that have been eradicated as a result of our knowing our genome? Zero,\u201d states Rutherford. \u201cAnd the number of diseases that have been cured as a result of gene therapy? Zero.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"d41e70d71d4d1a96c8f4689c962298d1b43a1b96\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d41e70d71d4d1a96c8f4689c962298d1b43a1b96/0_340_4966_2980/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Biology researcher Ewan Birney\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Biology researcher Ewan Birney challenged the world\u2019s top geneticists to predict the outcome of the Human Genome Project.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Antonio Olmos</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Such advances will doubtless occur in the long term. However, it is Rutherford\u2019s aim to bring some realism to the subject without losing a sense of wonder about the new biological visions being opened up. We have discovered that modern humans once interbred, albeit briefly, with our Neanderthal predecessors; conclusively pinpointed the corpse of Richard III; and demonstrated that the idea of race is an illusion. Indeed, on this last point, Rutherford is unequivocal. \u201cGenetics has shown that people are different and these differences cluster according to geography and culture but never in a way that aligns with the traditional concepts of human races.\u201d</p> <p>Nor is Rutherford happy with some of those who seek to commercialise modern genomics, and in particular derides ancestry companies that have claimed their DNA tests reveal the identity of Jack the Ripper; that Prince William harbours Indian blood; and that it is possible to trace living descendants of the Queen of Sheba. This is \u201cPR dressed up as research\u201d, we are told.</p> <p>For Rutherford, modern genetics has far less to say about us as individuals than we have been led to believe. On the other hand, he is confident it sheds a great deal of light on us as a species. Demonstrating these divergent concepts is not easy. Happily, Rutherford is up to the task. He has produced a polished, thoroughly entertaining history of <em>Homo sapiens</em> and its DNA in a manner that displays popular science writing at its best.</p> <p><em>A Brief History of Everyone Who Ever Lived is published by W&amp;N (\u00a320). </em><a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/brief-history-of-everyone-who-ever-lived.html\" title=\"\"><em>Click here to buy it for \u00a316</em></a></p>",
  "<h2><strong>1) Wenger pleads for patience over </strong>P\u00e9rez and Mustafi<strong> </strong></h2> <p>Gone are the days when Ars\u00e8ne Wenger could take a new signing and integrate him slowly to afford a gentler introduction into a new world. The story of Robert Pir\u00e8s starting with a watching brief as Arsenal met Sunderland in the kind of attritional battle that looked to the new man like a horror show remains an instructive one. Against Southampton the striker Lucas P\u00e9rez and the defender Shkodran Mustafi were plonked straight into a tense Premier League encounter and looked \u2013 perhaps understandably \u2013 a little offbeat. Wenger reflected that both had some nerves and were short of match fitness, as well as the obvious sense that partnerships have had no time to gel yet. Wenger is pleading for patience as they settle in. Mustafi looked small for a centre-back and hesitant at times. Lucas was eager, got an assist but was not sharp enough to make a significant impact. \u201cLet\u2019s not judge too quickly,\u201d Wenger said. \u201cLet\u2019s give them time.\u201d It was interesting, with that in mind, to see the third member of Arsenal\u2019s major summer newcomers\u2019 band on the bench. Granit Xhaka had been praised for his impressive show <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/27/watford-arsenal-premier-league-match-report\">at Watford last time out</a> but was left out against Southampton as the old partnership of Santi Cazorla and Francis Coquelin excelled. The balance between the two, blending Cazorla\u2019s trickery with Coquelin\u2019s tackles, seemed natural as the pair played increasingly important roles as the game went on. Wenger will probably feel compelled to play Mustafi regularly, with the Germany international having to adapt through game time given the centre-back injury situation. But with more options in midfield and up front, Xhaka and Lucas can expect to be rotated in and out as the Arsenal manager looks for his strongest team. <strong>Amy Lawrence</strong></p> <blockquote> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/10/arsenal-southampton-premier-league-match-report\">Match report: Arsenal 2-1 Southampton</a><br>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/11/arsenal-laurent-koscielny-doubt-champions-league-psg\">Laurent Koscielny battles to overcome eye injury in time to face PSG</a></p> </blockquote>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2016/sep/10/wenger-relieved-with-arsenal-late-win-over-southampton-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/52ecb\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2707112\"            data-video-name=\"Wenger relieved with Arsenal's late win over Southampton \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"PLP\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57d45047e4b07ac3d446ae25\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/09/10/160910arsenal_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/09/10/160910arsenal.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/09/10/160910arsenal_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2016/sep/10/wenger-relieved-with-arsenal-late-win-over-southampton-video\">Wenger relieved with Arsenal\u2019s late win over Southampton</a></figcaption> </figure>   <h2><strong>2) Pulis faces further Berahino frustration </strong></h2> <p>Saido Berahino had two golden chances at Bournemouth and the West Bromwich Albion striker could not take them.

When Hull City were last in the Premier League, Snodgrass was 40 minutes into his debut after moving from Norwich City when a knee injury put him out for a little over 15 months. Returning in time to help them back into the top flight, Snodgrass was one of Hull\u2019s few fit players for the season opener against Leicester City, in which he scored before helping himself to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/04/malta-scotland-world-cup-2018-qualifier\">a hat\u2011trick for Scotland against Malta</a>, then at the weekend whipped home a free-kick to grab a late, late point against Burnley. Mike Phelan said after the game that Snodgrass had considered retirement during his long spell on the sidelines \u2013 but now he is playing like a man just glad to be back on a football pitch. Despite their good start, Hull still have an uphill task to survive this season and they will need Snodgrass to keep at something close to this level to manage it. <strong>Nick Miller</strong></p> <blockquote> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/10/burnley-hull-city-premier-league-match-report\">Match report: Burnley 1-1 Hull City</a></p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-table\" data-canonical-url=\"https://frontend.gutools.co.uk/admin/football/player/card/competition/attack/283379/26/100\"> <div data-embed-type=\"table\" class=\"player-card player-card--football\" itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"> <div class=\"player-card__image-container\"> <img class=\"player-card__image\" itemprop=\"image\" src=\"https://sport.guim.co.uk/football/player-images/100/283379.jpg\" alt=\"Photo of Robert Snodgrass\"> </div> <div class=\"player-card__player\"> <div class=\"player-card__position\" itemprop=\"jobTitle\">Midfielder</div> <div class=\"player-card__name\" itemprop=\"name\">Robert Snodgrass</div> </div> <dl class=\"player-card__stats\"> <dt class=\"player-card__stat-name\">Appearances</dt> <dd class=\"player-card__stat-value\">4</dd>  <dt class=\"player-card__stat-name\">Goals</dt> <dd class=\"player-card__stat-value\">2</dd>  <dt class=\"player-card__stat-name\">Shots</dt> <dd class=\"player-card__stat-value\">10</dd>  <dt class=\"player-card__stat-name\">Shots on target</dt> <dd class=\"player-card__stat-value\">40%</dd>  <dt class=\"player-card__stat-name\">Offsides</dt> <dd class=\"player-card__stat-value\">1</dd> </dl> </div> </figure> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/sep/11/liverpool-leicester-sadio-mane-roberto-firmino-anfield\">Grandstanding Liverpool leave Leicester chasing shadows on Anfield\u2019s big day | Paul Wilson</a> </p> </aside>  <h2><strong>4) Are Liverpool so fragile their fans\u2019 chants could put them off?</strong><br></h2> <p>A 4-1 win against the league champions and, ultimately, a win that was as comfortable as that scoreline suggested, theoretically should be good news all round for Liverpool but J\u00fcrgen Klopp was irked by one development. \u201cPlease don\u2019t sing my name before the game is decided,\u201d he said after imploring the home crowd to pipe down in the second half. \u201cImmediately when the Kop started singing my name they [Leicester] were alone in front of Simon Mignolet. It\u2019s a little like celebrating a penalty before you have scored.\u201d He might well have a point; this is a theme for Klopp, having chastised himself for prematurely over-celebrating during the first game of the season against Arsenal, but one does wonder slightly about a team whose manager seemingly thinks they are so fragile that they can be distracted by fans singing the manager\u2019s name. He\u2019s probably just being overcautious but if they are so put off it also might explain why Liverpool are so infuriatingly inconsistent.

I think our mental energy will return much quicker because everyone wants to play in the Champions League. I don\u2019t think we can blame the Champions League for defeat at Liverpool, we were very well prepared for the match but we lost control. I am an honest man and Liverpool played better than us with great spirit.

Nobody likes a smart arse. As working titles go for a three-volume history of English football\u2019s self-immolating distrust of fancy dans, risk taking, big ideas and all the rest, you could do much worse. Talent will out, though, and at Old Trafford on Saturday Stones confirmed his progress under Pep Guardiola from colt to junior thoroughbred. It is a brilliant fit, a manager whose notion of team building has been based around ball-playing defenders, who is so passionate about taking risks in possession he could even defend with absolute conviction Claudio Bravo\u2019s debut caperings; with a genuinely fine young English defender at just the right point in his career. Against Manchester United, Guardiola continually leapt up on to his touchline to talk to Stones, who had a game of two halves: unruffled, kit immaculate, disturbed only by his own goalkeeper in the first half; and just about convincing as a last line against the aerial assault in the second. Quite where the next three seasons under the eyes of the high consul of anti-hoof might take him remains to be seen. But more, not less, of the most Stonesy bits of Stones can only be a good thing. <strong>Barney Ronay</strong></p> <blockquote> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/10/manchester-united-manchester-city-premier-league-match-report\">Match report: Manchester United 1-2 Manchester City</a><br>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/10/jose-mourinho-claudio-bravo-red-rooney-tackle-penalty\">Jos\u00e9 Mourinho criticises players and Mark Clattenburg</a></p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-table\" data-canonical-url=\"https://frontend.gutools.co.uk/admin/football/player/card/competition/defence/466552/11/100\"> <div data-embed-type=\"table\" class=\"player-card player-card--football\" itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"> <div class=\"player-card__image-container\"> <img class=\"player-card__image\" itemprop=\"image\" src=\"https://sport.guim.co.uk/football/player-images/100/466552.jpg\" alt=\"Photo of John Stones\"> </div> <div class=\"player-card__player\"> <div class=\"player-card__position\" itemprop=\"jobTitle\">Defender</div> <div class=\"player-card__name\" itemprop=\"name\">John Stones</div> </div> <dl class=\"player-card__stats\"> <dt class=\"player-card__stat-name\">Appearances</dt> <dd class=\"player-card__stat-value\">4</dd>  <dt class=\"player-card__stat-name\">Shots blocked</dt> <dd class=\"player-card__stat-value\">4</dd>  <dt class=\"player-card__stat-name\">Clearances</dt> <dd class=\"player-card__stat-value\">23</dd> </dl> </div> </figure>  <h2><strong>7) Benteke seems key to Pardew\u2019s Carroll-esque creation</strong></h2> <p>When Alan Pardew relived Christian Benteke\u2019s first goal for Crystal Palace, as he recalled the cleverly angled Wilfried Zaha cross that preceded the \u00a327m striker\u2019s header, one comparison proved irresistible. \u201cI knew Christian would score,\u201d said Palace\u2019s manager. \u201cI used to get the same feeling with Andy Carroll.\u201d As Newcastle United manager, Pardew never quite got over Carroll\u2019s \u00a335m departure for Liverpool but now Benteke\u2019s arrival from Anfield \u2013 and a somewhat Carroll-esque experience \u2013 promises to transform Palace\u2019s landscape. \u201cI know my strengths and weaknesses and I feel like I can score a lot of goals in this team,\u201d Benteke said after Saturday\u2019s 2-1 win at Middlesbrough. \u201cWe can play long balls, we can play short passes and our wingers can get behind defenders.\u201d Zaha, Andros Townsend and, when fit, Yohan Cabaye will be integral to such varied gameplans but Benteke seems key to Pardew\u2019s creation of the type of three-dimensional team he once envisaged constructing around Carroll. <strong>Louise Taylor</strong></p> <blockquote> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/10/middlesbrough-crystal-palace-premier-league-match-report\">Match report: Middlesbrough 1-2 Crystal Palace</a></p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"77946354893123fb1ea983cf48194cc98bbe7a98\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/77946354893123fb1ea983cf48194cc98bbe7a98/0_161_3069_1841/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Christian Benteke celebrates after opening the scoring at the Riverside.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Christian Benteke celebrates after opening the scoring at the Riverside.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Runnacles/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>8) Imbula still short of proving his worth for Stoke</strong></h2> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/sep/11/sick-stoke-mark-hughes-cure-defensive-woes\">Sick Stoke and Mark Hughes need to find cure for defensive woes | Paul Doyle</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Porto are one of European football\u2019s most canny recruiters. So when they forked out a club record fee to sign Giannelli Imbula from Marseille in 2015, it was a loud endorsement of the French midfielder\u2019s potential. The eagerness with which they <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/feb/01/stoke-giannelli-imbula-porto-record-fee-18m\">moved him on to Stoke City</a> in January also spoke volumes \u2013 and not only about the Portuguese club\u2019s ability to turn a quick profit. Imbula, 23, needs to prove his worth in the Premier League. He excelled in patches last season and the hope was that he would do so more consistently this term on the back of a good pre-season with Stoke. However, the campaign has not begun like that and on Saturday, when Tottenham Hotspur\u2019s midfielders constantly breezed past him with ease, he was the worst performer in a Stoke display that began brightly but ended up an ominous shambles. <strong>Paul Doyle</strong></p> <blockquote> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/10/stoke-city-tottenham-hotspur-premier-league-match-report\">Match report: Stoke City 0-4 Tottenham Hotspur</a></p> </blockquote> <h2><strong>9) The curious case of brilliant goals versus dangerous play </strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8f6da59077cca54c2a1676858664bc18a9ff9e0f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8f6da59077cca54c2a1676858664bc18a9ff9e0f/0_139_3400_2041/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Chelsea\u2019s Diego Costa scores with a bicycle kick against Swansea City.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chelsea\u2019s Diego Costa scores with a bicycle kick against Swansea City.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Athena Pictures/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/sep/11/swansea-back-up-chairman-words-draw-with-chelsea\">Swansea back up chairman\u2019s words in draw with Chelsea | Stuart James</a> </p> </aside>  <p>At the weekend two exceptional pieces of athleticism were seen as first Laurent Koscielny then Diego Costa scored bicycle kicks in crowded penalty areas, both crucial in earning their teams points and both moments to make you gasp and applaud. There was a third in the Championship, too, as Rudy Gestede performed similar aerobics to help Aston Villa to a point against Nottingham Forest. The odd thing about all three is that in each instance the scorers could well have taken a defender\u2019s head clean off and, indeed, Costa did seem to catch Kyle Naughton with a following-through boot. Of course, neutral spectators appreciate and applaud the skill required to perform such feats, and things such as this are at least part of the reason we love this sport that, like few others, combines physicality with technique in moments such as this. However, it is strange that, seemingly because they are scoring brilliant goals, they are let off what would be an instant free-kick for dangerous play in basically any other circumstance. It is doubly weird in a season when referees are clamping down on the heinous sin of pushing and shirt-tugging in the area that a boot travelling at great speed should not be similarly penalised. This is not to say any of these three should have been disallowed, and that the referees involved were wrong, but it does represent a curious inconsistency. <strong tabindex=\"-1\">Nick Miller</strong></p> <blockquote> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/11/swansea-city-chelsea-premier-league-match-report\">Match report: Swansea City 2-2 Chelsea</a></p> </blockquote> <h2><strong>10) Pereyra has added real poise to Watford\u2019s team</strong></h2> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/sep/11/west-ham-london-stadium-upton-park\">West Ham feeling far from home after London Stadium teething problems | Paul MacInnes</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Walter Mazzarri\u2019s Watford showed they can do more than just battle in their 4-2 win over West Ham United.

  "<p>Brainstorming is a waste of time and nearly always fails to result in good ideas. It is also outdated and ineffective.</p> <p>The term was introduced more than 50 years ago in <a href=\"http://www.campaignlive.co.uk/article/history-advertising-no-145-alex-osborns-brainstormers/1362408\" rel=\"nofollow\">Applied Imagination</a>, a book by Alex Osborn (an advertising executive), which was published in 1953. It was a cutting-edge idea at the time. It thrived in offices where to-do lists were chalked on the blackboard in the director\u2019s office.<br></p> <p>The world of work has changed, and the office chalkboard is long gone \u2013 but, staggeringly, we\u2019re still stuck with brainstorming as the go-to process to help us identify new ideas for our business.<br></p> <p>Just five years after the process was developed, investigations proved the ineffectiveness of brainstorming. In 1958 Yale University ran a study to test brainstorming. Male undergraduates were divided into groups and given a number of creative puzzles. They were told that to solve the problems they must follow Osborn\u2019s guidelines for brainstorming.<br></p> <p>To provide a control group, the same number of male students were given the same puzzles and told to work alone. The students working on their own came up with around twice the number of ideas and their ideas were found to be more \u201cfeasible\u201d and \u201ceffective\u201d by the judges.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Fewer ideas of better quality will always be of more value than a lot of useless ideas</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In 2012, <a href=\"http://soe.unc.edu/fac_research/faculty/sawyer.php\" rel=\"nofollow\">Keith Sawyer</a>, a psychologist from Washington University, summarised the findings on brainstorming: \u201cDecades of research have consistently shown that brainstorming groups think of far fewer ideas than the same number of people who work alone and later pool their ideas.\u201d<br></p> <p>Let\u2019s take a look at some of the brainstorming rules that have developed over time:<br></p> <h2>There are no dumb ideas, so encourage wild and exaggerated thinking</h2> <p>There are plenty of dumb ideas. When you encourage this type of thinking you end up with outcomes that are impractical and irrelevant.</p> <h2>Quantity counts at this stage, not quality</h2> <p>No it doesn\u2019t. Quality is always important. Fewer ideas of better quality will always be of more value than a lot of useless ideas.</p> <h2>Build on other people\u2019s ideas</h2> <p>Sometimes useful, but often it can lead you to bulk up a bad idea instead of coming up with something better.</p> <h2>Every person and every idea has equal worth</h2> <p>No, everyone has an equal opportunity to contribute something useful, and should be given the same amount of time to do so. But not all ideas will be of the same quality.</p> <h2>Only one person talking at a time</h2> <p>When you\u2019re trying to come up with ideas yourself, do you find it useful to be listening to someone else\u2019s at the same time? Brainstorming rules stipulate that there should only be one person talking at a time, but also that there\u2019s always someone talking. Your best ideas frequently come when you have moments of silence. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/small-business-network/2016/aug/01/how-to-handle-critics-negative-feedback-entrepreneur\">How to handle your critics: 'It felt like a slap in the face'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>If you leave these rules behind, here\u2019s an alternative approach:<br></p> <h2>First, work out the question you\u2019re trying to answer</h2> <p>It should be one that when answered well could deliver significant benefit, and a clear plan, for your business. The scope of the question should be at a realistic level for the size of your business. Initially, don\u2019t try to think how it can be answered \u2013 just if it can be practically answered.<br></p> <h2>Be proactive</h2> <p>Don\u2019t gaze into space hoping for a serendipitous thought to pop into your head \u2013 it rarely happens. There are many <a href=\"http://creatingminds.org/tools/tools_all.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">creative thinking tools</a> online, so try several and find the ones that work best for you. Some people find that jotting down ideas on pen and paper is the easiest and most effective route for creative thinking. </p> <h2>Give yourself thinking time</h2> <p>You know when you come up with the best ideas; when you feel most energised and creative \u2013 so create a ritual around this. A local coffee shop is a good place to allocate blocks of 20-30 minutes for quality thinking. During these times, focus solely on the question and push all the other issues to one side.<br></p> <h2>Keep revisiting your question</h2> <p>Ever had an idea pop into your head from nowhere? That was because you had the question percolating in your mind and your subconscious was working on it in the background. A great killer question places an issue deep within your mind, and because you repeatedly return to it over several days or weeks this keeps your subconscious mind active on the subject.<br></p> <p>Brainstorming assumes thinking is a team sport, but it isn\u2019t. Because teams don\u2019t think \u2013 individuals do. Dedicate time for solo thinking in an environment, and at a time, that\u2019s most effective for you \u2013 and encourage your team to do the same.<br></p> <p><em>Chris Thomason is managing director of Sprint for Growth.

  "<p>\u2018Can science get us to a point where there\u2019s a formula to drive a specific emotion?\u201d asks Tinie Tempah as he puts on an EEG (electroencephalogram) hat, which looks like a weird swimming cap with wires sticking out of it.</p> <p>For Professor Slawomir Nasuto and Dr Ian Daly, this is the \u201choly grail\u201d at the heart of a five-year project. They\u2019re hoping to harness the emotional power of music for therapeutic uses \u2013 \u201cto create a system which eventually will be able to help people with depression and different forms of emotional disorders associated with neurological disorders.\u201d<br></p> <p>\u201cMusic evokes emotion,\u201d says Tinie. \u201cMusic can bring a crowd of 100,000 people from all different races, religions, sexualities all together \u2013 there\u2019s not many mediums that can do that.\u201d<br></p> <p>Nasuto is the director of Reading University\u2019s <a href=\"http://bel.reading.ac.uk/\">Brain Embodiment Laboratory</a>, within the Biomedical Engineering Section of the School of Biological Sciences, who use everything from robotics to tissue culture labs to research the relationships between body, mind and environment. With Daly he\u2019s been working on the Brain Computer Music Interface for Monitoring and Inducing Affective States (<a href=\"http://cmr.soc.plymouth.ac.uk/bcmi-midas/index.html\">BCMI-MIdAS</a>), a joint project with a team at the University of Plymouth lead by Professor Eduardo Miranda. Normally the participants they work with are undergraduate students. But today their subject is Brit and Mobo award-winning rapper <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/tinie-tempah\">Tinie Tempah</a>, a musician who\u2019s more used to scanning lyric sheets than having his brain scanned in a university lab.</p> <p>For the experiment, they get subjects like Tinie to listen to music under laboratory conditions: hooked up to an EEG while having their brains scanned from the inside of an fMRI (functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging) machine \u2013 which bears some resemblance to a giant sci-fi donut.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"91d376146770fc416127c41fbc15a436761855be\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/91d376146770fc416127c41fbc15a436761855be/0_0_2560_1440/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tinnie listens to music while having an fMRI scan of his brain.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"563\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tinnie listens to music while having an fMRI scan of his brain.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There\u2019s always been a strong connection between music and emotion. We listen to sad songs when we\u2019re down, put upbeat music on to dance to when we\u2019re happy. It amplifies our emotions, punctuates the big moments in life, makes the everyday a bit more fun: we sing at weddings, we play music at funerals, commute with headphones on, lose ourselves in festival gigs.<br></p> <p>From their different perspectives, the scientists and musician both agree on music\u2019s emotional power.<br></p> <p>Nasuto argues that music has always had \u201ca very strong emotional affect on humans. There is a very primeval link between us and music \u2013 it has been with us for a very long time, probably the beginning of human culture.\u201d<br></p> <p>In scientific terms, Nasuto describes music as \u201ca very powerful type of stimulation which can evoke emotional responses\u201d, and it\u2019s this effect that has lead them to study how it works on the brain. If you can see what\u2019s happening inside someone\u2019s brain when they are listening to a happy or a sad song, then it\u2019s a starting point to understanding how music affects human beings.<br></p> <p>Of course, then you have to find a way to define everyday terms like \u201chappy\u201d or \u201csad\u201d in a way that makes sense in a laboratory; in other words, to find a way to quantify and measure emotions.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9396115a2224bb7526329f9107df87fd8e568844\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9396115a2224bb7526329f9107df87fd8e568844/0_0_2400_1440/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tinie Tempah puts on an EEG hat, which looks like a weird swimming cap with wires sticking out of it.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tinie Tempah puts on an EEG hat, which looks like a weird swimming cap with wires sticking out of it.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For their study, the team at Reading use a \u201cvalence arousal circumplex model\u201d \u2013 a graph which \u201cmaps all of the complexity of human emotions onto two axes.\u201d The valence axis, Daly explains, shows \u201chow pleasant or unpleasant an experience is\u201d, while the arousal axis measures \u201chow exciting or boring an experience is.\u201d In this way it\u2019s possible to plot an emotional response between the two. For example, \u201cfear is an emotion which is highly arousing and very low valence, both exciting and unpleasant\u201d says Daly, whereas \u201ccalm\u201d would be unarousing and low valence \u2013 a pleasant but not very exciting experience.<br></p> <p>By combining data sets, a fuller picture of what\u2019s happening when we experience emotions emerges; we can see what areas of the brain are being stimulated when our brains are listening to music, and how much activity there is. In other words, what your brain looks like \u201con music\u201d.<br></p> <p>In their studies, the scientists play their subjects a combination of classical and \u201csynthetic music\u201d \u2013 not electroclash or EDM, but music generated by a computer algorithm developed by Professor Eduardo Miranda, Dr Alexis Kirke and Dr Duncan Williams at Plymouth University that helps to create a controlled test (it\u2019s the abstract music you can hear playing in the interactive here).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--immersive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/2016/seat/music/interactive/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/2016/seat/music/interactive/boot.js\" data-alt=\"interactive\"> </figure>  <p>The idea, says Nasuto, is to create music that\u2019s as near as possible to laboratory conditions; Plymouth\u2019s algorithmic music generation \u201cenables us to provide as simple as possible stimulus by reducing the complexity, but it also gives us a much stronger control on manipulating individual features.\u201d</p> <p>Dr Daly explains: \u201ctechnically the synthetic music is music, but it\u2019s not really the most exciting stuff to listen to, so we play classical music to all our participants to get a bit more of an in-depth look at how people respond to different types of music.<br></p> <p>\u201cYour emotional response to music changes for the second or third hearing \u2013 the first time you hear a piece of music you react differently. So if we can use generated music you can guarantee that they\u2019ve never heard that piece of music before. Whereas if we use real music, whether it\u2019s pop music or classical music, it\u2019s quite likely that the participant may have heard that piece of music before.\u201d<br></p> <p>Nasuto continues, \u201cmusic itself is a very complex acoustic signal or stimulus \u2013 it interacts with us on many different dimensions. It is an acoustic stimulus like anything you hear, but also it interacts with us on a cognitive level because we can appreciate the structure of the music, the patterning of the melody and so on.\u201d If they used normal music for the whole study it would be \u201cvery difficult to isolate and pinpoint the causes of particular emotional changes in the subject,\u201d he says.<br></p> <p>According to Daly, the test shows that \u201cwe\u2019re able to identify which regions of Tinie\u2019s brain are responding to music-induced emotion.\u201d As for bringing the worlds of science and music together to share their experience of emotion, perhaps the scientists have learned as much from Tinie as he has from the experiment.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/ng-interactive/2016/sep/12/the-science-of-sound-tinie-tempahs-brain-on-music\">The science of sound: Tinie Tempah\u2019s brain on music</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cIt was interesting to listen to Tinie\u2019s explanation that when he comes to compose music it has to feel right for him \u2013 there is an element of a very intuitive, qualitative assessment which he seems to be using which refers to his personal feelings about how the music feels to him, a kind of body resonance with the music,\u201d says Nasuto. \u201cIt\u2019s not an assessment that is very explicitly cognitive \u2013 although perhaps there are some cognitive processes going on when he actually decides how to develop the piece of music. But whether he\u2019s satisfied with it or not goes back to this basic emotional response.\u201d<br></p> <p>For Tinie, his takeaway from the experience is more straightforward. \u201cWhether you\u2019re in a festival or at your house, music can make you come out of yourself, be like an ultimate version of yourself. It\u2019s interesting to know what affects my mood, what makes me happy. At the end of the day music is always going to be an emotional thing for me, it\u2019s a feeling.\u201d</p>",
  "<p><strong>Hometown: </strong>South-east London. </p> <p><strong>The lineup:</strong> Amy Love (vocals, guitar), Georgia South (bass, backing vocals).</p> <p><strong>The background: </strong>Nova Twins are all about that bass: the lurching, grinding, seismically distorted, FX-mangled sound that propels the music of this young London duo: Georgia South, 19, and Amy Love, who is in her early 20s (Tim Nugent, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jan/06/ted-nugent-obama-is-a-psychopathic-america-hating-liar-republican-gun-control\">no relation to Ted</a>, adds drums). They call it urban punk but elsewhere their bass-heavy racket with irascible, sharply insinuating vocals has been variously titled hip hop-grime, grime-pop/\u201cgrop\u201d, even \u201cgrunk\u201d, such is their furious collision of grime and punk. \u201cWe are females of colour playing heavy music,\u201d declares Love, who alternately sings (term used advisedly) and raps, with backing squeals from South. \u201cSometimes we have to shout a little bit louder. We don\u2019t want to be pigeonholed.\u201d Their heroes range from MC5 to Missy Elliott, Skunk Anansie to Skepta, and they get a broad demographic at their increasingly populous gigs, although to date they have attracted more punks and rockers than grime kids.</p> <p>\u201cBecause our sound and delivery is so intense, and because we do it all live, without laptops or any programming, some grime people are put off,\u201d explains Love. \u201cBut we want it to be more open \u2013 we want diversity in our audience \u2019cos that\u2019s what we are,\u201d she says of their mixed parentage. \u201cWe want guys in snapbacks next to guys with mohawks and nose rings.

Don\u2019t they have a Year Zero mentality like their spiky-bonced forebears? Aren\u2019t they defined by who they hate? \u201cNo,\u201d argues South, who was minus-20 in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2012/jul/16/archive-1977-punk-music-sex-pistols\">The Year Punk Broke</a>. \u201cWe\u2019re defined by music we love. We don\u2019t want to focus on other people. Grime is the modern-day punk. They don\u2019t give a shit, they create their own scene. It\u2019s very DIY,\u201d she adds, pointing out that their video to Bassline Bitch was shot in 10 minutes, using a cheap Canon, by South\u2019s mum.</p> <p>Nova Twins are \u201cmentored\u201d by their parents, whose respective backgrounds are as jazz musicians and music teachers. They drive them on tour and get stuck in at gigs \u2013 \u201cthe dirtier the better,\u201d laughs Love. What do they make of the colourful language and angry attitude? They\u2019re all for it, apparently, especially Bassline Bitch\u2019s underdog anthemia. \u201cWe\u2019re saying, \u2018Fuck [money], do what you like, make your own movement, shout until you\u2019re heard,\u201d says South. The video for Hitlist \u2013 another EP highlight that, like much of Nova Twins\u2019 output, sounds like a warning \u2013 captured their spirit of frenzied gratification. \u201cWe only had a small budget, and we spent most of it on alcohol for our friends to dance to, to loosen them up \u2013 there were a lot of girls standing and screaming. Everyone had a really good time.\u201d </p> <p>One of punk\u2019s dictums was \u201cI\u2019m bored\u201d. Those very words open Nova Twins\u2019 track Wave. How can anyone be bored in 2016? \u201cThe internet? That\u2019s boring,\u201d accuses Love. \u201cIt\u2019s just looking at a screen!\u201d Actually, Wave is about sex, famously described by Johnny Rotten as \u201ctwo minutes and 52 seconds of squelching\u201d. Are Nova Twins even bored by sex? \u201cSometimes,\u201d they cackle, \u201csometimes not.\u201d</p> <p>They rarely if ever \u201ctalk about heartbreak \u2013 it\u2019s more about anger\u201d and are unlikely to pen a love song any time soon. They\u2019re recording with Pat Collier (X-Ray Spex, Jakwob) and Adrian Hall (Goldfrapp, Anna Calvi) has been mixing their music. They\u2019ve managed to maintain their position even faced with record companies eager to control what they do and how they sound. </p> <p>\u201cWhen we were younger and slightly more vulnerable, someone pissed us off, trying to make us sound less live, reduce the power of the bass and make us sound American,\u201d recalls Love. \u201cHe was expecting us to be more pop, thinking, \u2018That\u2019s a bit heavy.\u2019 So we walked out, and he walked out.

  "<p>To the smartphone-addled among us, advising the use of apps to fix mental health problems might seem like telling someone who needs to get fit to live on jam and fags. But it\u2019s happening all the same. While <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/aug/22/third-teenage-girls-depression-anxiety-survey-trend-truant\" title=\"\">gadget and social media addiction are lampooned for increasing teenage depression</a>, and complaints abound that the constant compulsion to check apps and message conduits leaves us frazzled and scatterbrained, purveyors of wearable tech, app designers and even the NHS really want us to use our phones for soul-soothing.</p> <p>The idea of treating mental health digitally is not new. A PC-based online cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) treatment for depression has been in clinical use for seven years now \u2013 rolling out newer such services via smartphone apps will make this kind of treatment even more accessible. Meanwhile, there are more than 500 mindfulness apps, offering meditation soundtracks, relaxation techniques and pearls of wisdom, not to mention the many fitness/self-optimisation apps making forays into mood tracking. Everyone\u2019s at it, from Apple Watch\u2019s Breathe, to the guy who invented the online monster adoption game, Moshi Monsters, Michael Acton Smith. Scrolling through <a href=\"https://www.calm.com/\" title=\"\">his mindfulness app, Calm\u2019s</a>, sensory front page options \u2013 rain falling on foliage, a mountain lake \u2013 is blissful, but can increasing reliance on phones really help us find peace?</p> <p>There is evidence that mental health apps can work. This summer, it was announced that <a href=\"https://www.sleepio.com/\" title=\"\">Sleepio, a digital CBT programme for tackling insomnia</a>, has had a successful NHS \u201creal-world\u201d trial, after being offered via the Manchester service, Self Help (this follows a <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/profile/June_Brown/publication/225086520_A_randomized_placebo-controlled_trial_of_online_cognitive_behavioral_therapy_for_chronic_insomnia_disorder_delivered_via_an_automated_media-rich_web_application/links/0fcfd5072ad0c44aa5000000.pdf\" title=\"\">placebo-group randomised control trial</a> . The app assesses users\u2019 worries, sleep schedules, lifestyle and bedrooms, before teaching them CBT techniques. Through improving their sleep, the 98 participants saw a 68% recovery rate from anxiety and depression symptoms, compared with an NHS average of 45%.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media-network/2016/sep/07/shaping-mental-health-support-open-data\">Can data shape the future of mental health support?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The app was co-created by <a href=\"https://www.sleepio.com/blog/2012/02/14/the-sleepio-story-so-far-by-peter-hames-co-founder/\" title=\"\">Peter Hames</a>, an NHS Innovation Fellow, and <a href=\"https://www.sleepio.com/sleep-expert/\" title=\"\">Colin Espie</a>, who is professor of sleep medicine at Oxford University. It has already been privately administered to <a href=\"http://mobihealthnews.com/content/big-health-raises-12-million-sleep-focused-employee-wellness-app-sleepio\" title=\"\">more than 750,000 staff members at US companies</a> such as Comcast, LinkedIn, Boston Medical Center and the Henry Ford Health System. And Sleepio\u2019s parent company, <a href=\"https://www.bighealth.com/\" title=\"\">Big Health</a>, recently secured $12m funding, to further scale up delivery of drug-free, mental-health treatments.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the wearable-tech industry is extending its offer into the realm of stress relief. The idea being that devices can track personal biometrics, and then that data can be used to positively influence changes in our behaviour. Fitness brands such as the <a href=\"https://misfit.com/go/ray\" title=\"\">Misfit Ray</a> and <a href=\"https://jawbone.com/fitness-tracker/up3\" title=\"\">Jawbone Up3</a> offer rudimentary sleep tracking, and the opportunity to recognise causes for soaring resting heart rates. The upcoming <a href=\"http://www.myfeel.co/\" title=\"\">Feel</a> (another wristband) claims to detect mood via electrodermal activity, blood volume pulse and skin temperature. And clip-on devices <a href=\"https://webshop.bellabeat.com/\" title=\"\">Bellabeat Leaf</a>, <a href=\"http://prana.co/\" title=\"\">Prana</a> and <a href=\"https://www.spire.io/uk\" title=\"\">Spire</a> track breathing.</p> <p>When <a href=\"http://moraveji.org/\" title=\"\">Neema Moraveji</a>, chief scientist and co-founder at Spire, and director of the <a href=\"http://calmingtechnology.org/\" title=\"\">Stanford University Calm Lab</a>, researched the physiological changes that manifest the body according to mood, he says they \u201cfound respiration to be a unique and interesting signal because you have direct control over it\u201d. This was followed up by lab studies that, he says, \u201cshowed that if you give people feedback about their breathing, they can change it so easily that they don\u2019t even need to stop what they\u2019re doing\u201d.</p> <p>I started road-testing Spire while coincidentally doing a meditation course. It was encouraging to see all my calm streaks (as Spire calls them) on screen. And realising that a three-minute stress streak coincided with my computer inexplicably not allowing me to copy text from one email to another gave me a calm detachment about inevitable technical issues.</p> <p>I liked that I could view my breath on screen as a wavy line. One of the app\u2019s guided \u201cboosts\u201d involves following a pace-slowing dot along said line. Another \u201cboost\u201d talked me through alternate nostril breathing, which has a surprisingly settling effect (although I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d do it on the bus).</p> <p>But my chill honeymoon didn\u2019t last long. First I learned that my dad had had a mild-but-debilitating stroke, and then I accidentally reversed into a parked car while distracted by a screaming child. When I checked Spire to wallow in my dramatic breathing data, the app had detected zero stress.</p> <p>I ask Moraveji whether this could be because I unknowingly breathe deeply to get through turmoil. \u201cPeople do learn naturally to slow their breathing when they\u2019re stressed,\u201d he says, \u201cand it might have been that you were so tense that you were holding your breath. That\u2019s something we\u2019re updating in the app.\u201d My relationship with Spire isn\u2019t over, but it no longer takes precedence over Instagram.</p> <p>Claire Burge is a productivity specialist, brought in by companies (Virgin and Siemens, among others) to liberate staff from mental-energy draining, email-based cultures. She has thought about this question of phones as mental health tools a lot. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a conducive environment,\u201d she says. \u201cPhones create neural loops that mindfulness should counter, but that means a break away from the object that creates the neural loop in the first place.\u201d</p> <p>Even the creator of bestselling mindfulness app <a href=\"http://buddhify.com/\" title=\"\">Buddhify</a>, is having doubts about his industry. In a <a href=\"https://medium.com/@rohan_21awake/the-future-of-mindfulness-apps-and-how-to-stop-it-part-1-1ddc4288ca4f#.kf30iixgw\" title=\"\">recent, widely circulated blog post</a>, Rohan Gunatillake describes the app world as \u201cwarring fiefdoms\u201d, battling for market domination, whereas, \u201ccommunity has historically always been part of the mindfulness tradition. Whether it is people practising together or teachers supporting each other with shared codes of ethics, engaging with peers is a central part of the culture\u201d.</p> <p>He also fears that the way digital mindfulness is monetised, by dangling limited free content up front, with subscriptions then offered if you want all the whistles and bells, risks financially excluding people. \u201cThe demographic is English-speaking, middle-class and financially stable,\u201d he writes.</p> <p>Moreover, mindfulness apps are largely peddling guided meditations, rather than providing the learning and insight you get from experienced teachers. Gunatillake wants to build a bridge between the two strands of mindfulness \u2013 traditional and digital \u2013 with teachers more involved in app design.</p> <p>With apps reaching more people than face-to-face teaching can, he says, \u201cnothing will influence how mindfulness is perceived and practised in our culture more in the next 20 years\u201d.</p>",

  "<p>Theresa May, clearly mindful of powerful opposition to her plan to bring back more grammar schools, has claimed the new wave should be \u201cinclusive\u201d and immune to colonisation by sharp-elbowed middle-class parents and admit far more children from poor backgrounds. But is that possible?</p> <p>The outgoing chief inspector of schools, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/sep/05/michael-wilshaw-ofsted-chief-grammar-schools-theresa-may-poorer-children\">Sir Michael Wilshaw</a>, recently suggested that more grammars will inevitably benefit certain groups of children. At the heart of this debate lies the vexed question of whether ability, and thus academic potential, is fixed; whether it can be can be reliably tested at any single point in a child\u2019s life; and whether it is affected by coaching, parental support and social class background.</p> <p>One group of campaigners, which has been <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/0B66iZZlhOR6PeDBreGZYSHVWY0E\">scrutinising</a> the results of 11-plus tests in its fully selective area for the past three years (the 11-plus is still in use in 25% of education authorities) believes the evidence is now clear.</p> <p>While the prime minister, whose education consultation document is published this week, claims a \u201csmarter\u201d test and new wave of non-binary selective schools are possible, the campaigners argue the test is intrinsically unfair and will always benefit children from certain homes, undermining the entire rationale for a change in policy.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/LocalEqualExcellent/\">Local Equal Excellent</a> began investigating the impact of the 11-plus in Buckinghamshire after grammar schools there said they were introducing a new test that was \u201cresistant to coaching\u201d.

It showed that children from local state primary schools had been less successful than in previous years, while a higher proportion of privately educated pupils had passed.</p> <p>With two more years of test data and further evidence from CEM released under the Freedom of Information Act, the group claims the evidence against the test is stronger than ever. It shows a continuing strong bias against children from the most deprived postcodes (measured by the government\u2019s <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income_deprivation_affecting_children_index_%28UK%29\">income deprivation affecting children</a> \u2013 IDACI).</p> <p>Only weeks after the prime minister announced she would be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/aug/27/theresa-may-announces-audit-to-tackle-public-sector-racial-disparities\">scrutinising public services</a> for their promotion of racial equality, it also suggests the test is biased against children from certain minority ethnic backgrounds. Results from 2014 and 2015 show that, after white British children, the largest ethnic group of grammar school applicants in Buckinghamshire was Pakistani children, who made up 11% of the cohort. In 2015 only 10% of grammar school applicants from Pakistani heritage backgrounds passed the 11-plus, compared with 21% of children from white British backgrounds. According to the campaign group, disadvantage for some minority ethnic groups exists even when families aren\u2019t on low incomes.</p> <p>\u201cBME [black and minority ethic] disadvantage is very pronounced among those not eligible for free school meals, so it is not the case that some BME pupils have lower scores simply because more of them are eligible for free school meals,\u201d says Rebecca Hickman, founder member of the group.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/aug/23/argument-for-grammar-schools-selective-education-theresa-may\">Got a good argument for\u00a0the return of grammar schools?

It suggested test outcomes might be related to either primary schooling, culture or the applicant\u2019s local community.</p> <p>Even with identical test results at the end of primary school, higher-attaining children from the poorer postcodes scored, on average, 20 marks less in the new Bucks test (the pass mark is 121 marks) than their better-off peers. The data suggests a similar bias against children from some BME groups, including Pakistani.</p> <p>In 2014 there were 276 Buckinghamshire children eligible for free school meals who took the 11-plus. Just 10 passed it.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.swbgs.com/\">Sir William Borlase\u2019s</a> grammar school, whose plans to expand into May\u2019s Maidenhead constituency are being supported by the PM, has only three children eligible for free school meals.</p> <p>\u201cBuckinghamshire is a particularly good area in which to analyse how the 11-plus test works in practice,\u201d says Hickman. \u201cUnlike other selective areas in England, all the children at Buckinghamshire state primary schools are entered into the 11-plus exam unless their parents opt out.</p> <p>\u201cSo if the test was resistant to coaching we should by now be seeing substantial narrowing of results between children from different backgrounds. The fact that the evidence shows the reverse raises uncomfortable questions about why a test that consistently selects on the basis of prior opportunity and social background is still allowed.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"4cc33513a46add77f842324e74870cf9e313439d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4cc33513a46add77f842324e74870cf9e313439d/134_7_354_354/354.jpg\" alt=\"Rafiq Raja, Muslim Parents Association in High Wycombe\" width=\"354\" height=\"354\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rafiq Raja of the Muslim Parents Association: \u2018The 11-plus is a legalised form of discrimination\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>CEM has quietly withdrawn its brochure claiming that the test, which is believed to be worth <a href=\"http://schoolsweek.co.uk/campaigners-question-1m-tutor-proof-11-plus-tests/\">\u00a31m a year</a> to the university, can assess \u201cnatural\u201d ability. And <a href=\"https://www.dur.ac.uk/education/staff/profile/?id=614\">Prof Robert Coe</a>, director of CEM, says his researchers are still looking at why certain groups are not doing well in the test.</p> <p>\u201cThe concept of ability is very problematic and comes with a lot of other baggage. I wouldn\u2019t use the term \u2018natural ability\u2019 and we did remove it from our online material,\u201d he says. \u201cWhatever system you use it is imprecise, there are false positives and negatives and probably more of those than people realise.</p> <p>\u201cIf I was designing a system from scratch I wouldn\u2019t suggest creating grammar schools and I wouldn\u2019t support the expansion of grammars on the grounds of social mobility. But given that we still have them for political reasons, we are interested in trying to make the system fairer. Even though it is a murky world there are lots of things we can do to make the system better.\u201d</p> <p>However, the findings come as no surprise to Rafiq Raja, of the Muslim Parents Association in High Wycombe, which contains the three wards with the highest concentration of Pakistani heritage families in Buckinghamshire.</p> <p>\u201cGrammar schools do a good job for the pupils who gain admittance,\u201d he says. \u201cBut selection is having a negative impact on the majority of children, especially those from BME backgrounds where parents are aspirant but often see a glass ceiling, linked to their own experience, which limits their ambitions for their children. They may not know how to help their children, or be able to afford the extra coaching.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/04/school-divided-society-eu-referendum-segregating-children\">Much of Britain's bitter division began in school</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Raja believes the selection process can never be completely \u201cblind\u201d as the tests are inevitably culturally biased, and weighted towards English language skills in a community where families often still speak Punjabi or Urdu at home and children may get fewer extracurricular experiences. \u201cAs things stand, the 11-plus is a legalised form of discriminatory practice,\u201d says Raja.</p> <p>So will it ever be possible to overcome the impact of family background and environment on this type of selection process? According to <a href=\"https://iris.ucl.ac.uk/iris/browse/profile?upi=TISAA27\">Tina Isaacs</a>, senior lecturer in educational assessment at the UCL Institute of Education, the idea that ability is fixed is now discredited. And testing for \u201cfuture potential\u201d is fraught with difficulties.</p> <p>\u201cIn the 1940s and 50s most people believed that IQ was fixed,\u201d she says. \u201cMost reputable opinion now believes that there is a mix of heritability and environment in intelligence. Scientists differ about how much is genetic and how much is environmental but no one disputes that it is a mix of the two.\u201d</p> <p>Isaacs believes most 11-plus test providers have tried to ensure that individual tests questions are unbiased and culturally neutral though, like Coe, she admits there is inevitably some \u201cmeasurement error\u201d that is impossible to get rid of. This could be to do with a range of personal or local circumstances on the day.</p> <p>\u201cSo any reliable assessment of future potential would have to consist of much more than a single test,\u201d she says. \u201cI would defy anyone to come up with an 11-plus test that isn\u2019t in some way related to prior learning and practice \u2013 that is just common sense. The more you practise something, the more chance of success you have.\u201d</p> <p>Local Equal Excellent has now asked the Buckinghamshire grammar schools to withdraw what it calls a \u201cdiscredited\u201d test. \u201cEither the grammar schools and the test providers are suggesting that children from certain backgrounds have inherently less academic potential, or they must concede that the 11-plus exam is failing to do what they claim it does,\u201d says Hickman.</p> <p>\u201cIf the government is truly concerned with helping all children to fulfil their potential, far from toying with expanding selection, they should instead be working out the best way to get rid of it altogether.\u201d</p>",

They have been so numerous, and so offensive, they have almost lost their power to shock. </p> <p>But with Hillary Clinton\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/10/hillary-clinton-basket-of-deplorables-donald-trump\">off-the-cuff remarks about the bigotry of Trump\u2019s supporters</a>, we have officially reached the point of no return. This deplorable election, featuring a deplorable candidate, is now circling the drain because the only respectable candidate expressed her disdain for racist voters.</p> <p>Voters hold an unusual amount of respect in any election. We may have lost our respect for politicians, sports stars, religious leaders and just about every profession, but voters remain sacrosanct. So Clinton\u2019s comments have crossed a line: an unforced error that reveals how flawed a campaigner she is.</p> <p>\u201cYou know, to just be grossly generalistic,\u201d she told a Manhattan fundraiser, \u201cyou could put half of Trump\u2019s supporters into what I call the basket of deplorables. Right? The racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamophobic \u2013 you name it. And unfortunately there are people like that. And he has lifted them up.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video element--supporting\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/sep/10/hillary-clinton-half-of-trumps-supporters-go-into-the-basket-of-deplorables-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/52dnz\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2706693\"            data-video-name=\"Hillary Clinton: 'half of Trump's supporters go into the basket of deplorables' - video\"            data-video-provider=\"AP\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57d41f39e4b08465d44ff4a7\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/09/10/160910ClintonTrumpFans2_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/09/10/160910ClintonTrumpFans2.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/09/10/160910ClintonTrumpFans2_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/sep/10/hillary-clinton-half-of-trumps-supporters-go-into-the-basket-of-deplorables-video\">Hillary Clinton: \u2018half of Trump\u2019s supporters go into the basket of deplorables\u2019</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>And so the \u201cbasket of deplorables\u201d has found its place alongside other debris in the gaffe sewer of recent elections, including this stinker from a fundraiser in San Francisco in 2008: \u201cYou go into these small towns in Pennsylvania and, like a lot of small towns in the midwest, the jobs have been gone now for 25 years and nothing\u2019s replaced them. And they fell through the Clinton administration, and the Bush administration, and each successive administration has said that somehow these communities are going to regenerate and they have not.</p> <p>\u201cAnd it\u2019s not surprising then they get bitter, they cling to guns or religion or antipathy toward people who aren\u2019t like them, or anti-immigrant sentiment or anti-trade sentiment, as a way to explain their frustrations.\u201d</p> <p>The speaker of these grossly generalistic insults of the pro-gun, pro-God culture of Middle America? Barack Obama, of course.</p> <p>Those comments came to light in April 2008, as Obama was fighting one Hillary Clinton for votes in the Pennsylvania primary. \u201cI was taken aback by the demeaning remarks Senator Obama made about people in small-town America,\u201d Clinton said at the time. \u201cHis remarks are elitist and out of touch.\u201d</p> <p>Clinton\u2019s staffers started handing out stickers saying \u201cI\u2019m not bitter\u201d and she went on to win the primary by nine points. She ultimately lost the nomination by a convincing margin.</p> <p>What of the lasting damage to candidate Obama from this revealing insight into this elitist character? In the general election, Obama won Pennsylvania by 10 points. He took God-fearing Virginia by 6 points, and gun-loving Indiana by 1 point.</p> <p>Ah, yes. But what about Mitt Romney\u2019s unforgettable gaffe \u2013 also at a fundraiser among the super-wealthy \u2013 when he condemned not just half of his opponent\u2019s supporters, but half of the population of the United States?</p> <p>\u201cThere are 47% of the people who will vote for the president no matter what,\u201d he said, \u201cwho are dependent upon government, who believe that they are victims. These are people who pay no income tax \u2026 and so my job is not to worry about those people. I\u2019ll never convince them that they should take personal responsibility and care for their lives.\u201d</p> <p>Why did the Romney gaffe stick? Because it played into months of multi-million-dollar advertising and messaging from the Obama campaign about Romney\u2019s lack of compassion for the middle class. After all those attacks, the gaffe seemed like Romney\u2019s confession of the truth.</p> <p>So where is the comparable anti-Clinton narrative, bolstered by huge ad spends and a consistent communications strategy? (And no, tweets don\u2019t count.) The Trump campaign, such as it is, has no major ad spending, and nothing that resembles a strategy in communications, policy or politics. It is singularly ill equipped to profit from this gift of a gaffe.</p> <p>If any candidate plays into this gaffe-fest, it\u2019s Trump himself. Because the real power of a gaffe is that it exposes some unspeakable truth. And the truth is that many Trump supporters are indeed attracted by the \u201cracist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamophobic\u201d eruptions of the candidate himself.</p> <p>Trump built his candidacy on questioning the birthplace of the country\u2019s first black president. He went on to suggest that the same president harbored sympathies for Isis. <a href=\"http://www.publicpolicypolling.com/main/2016/05/gop-quickly-unifies-around-trump-clinton-still-has-modest-lead.html\">Sure enough</a>, two-thirds of Trump supporters believe Obama is Muslim and 59% think he wasn\u2019t born in the United States. It\u2019s unlikely they hold these views in an adorable way.</p> <p>Deplorable, on the other hand, might be a great word to describe a candidate who suggests that gun owners should shoot Hillary Clinton to stop her proposals on gun safety? That would be the <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/08/trump-violent-rhetoric-history-226873\">same candidate</a> whose butler posted that someone should shoot Obama, and whose supporters regularly chant \u201ckill the bitch\u201d when Clinton\u2019s name is mentioned. </p> <p>Clinton isn\u2019t missing the other appeal of Donald Trump: the aspirational side of his policy agenda that his supporters are yearning for. There is no other appeal of Trump and no aspirational agenda. That\u2019s why the Clinton campaign is digging in for a long fight about Trump\u2019s deplorable nature.</p> <p>Was the comment elitist, tone-deaf and self-defeating? Could it \u2013 along with the health scare stories \u2013 narrow the Clinton poll lead by a point or two? As Sarah Palin would say, you betcha.</p> <p>But please spare us the false equivalency. There are worse political crimes than such gaffes. And there are older, unhealthier candidates running for president.</p>",

After her bout with illness became known, Clinton\u2019s health became a case study in how she and her team have struggled to communicate with the public, a struggle that is nothing short of Clintonesque.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/11/hillary-clinton-leaves-911-ceremony-after-feeling-overheated\">Hillary Clinton has pneumonia, says doctor, after exit from 9/11 ceremony</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Clintons\u2019 reluctance to readily release information was again on display as her campaign complicated what could have been a simple explanation and turned it into an all-day drip of information.</p> <p>\u201cIs there a story, real or imagined, that the Clinton campaign can\u2019t make worse?\u201d asked Nevada-based political analyst Jon Ralston.</p> <p>By turns, while reporters tried to piece together what had happened, her team stonewalled, abandoned the reporters assigned to follow her in public and eventually disclosed \u2013 after declaring her \u201cmuch better\u201d for TV crews \u2013 that the candidate had been diagnosed with pneumonia two days earlier. </p> <p>The scrambled timeline and delay in keeping reporters in the loop is a standard of practice that has become expected, and even synonymous, with the Clintons.</p> <p>On Sunday morning, Clinton arrived at a memorial service for the 15th anniversary of the September 11 attacks in downtown New York. Roughly an hour and half after Clinton arrived, reporters noticed she had gone. For 90 minutes, the campaign refused to give any details to the press designated to follow Clinton in public, refusing to confirm if she had indeed left the ceremony. </p> <p>Fox News reported that Clinton stumbled as she was helped into a van. After weeks of frenzied speculation about the Democratic nominee\u2019s health, mostly by Republicans and conspiracy theorists, the lack of facts fuelled theories online. <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Yair_Rosenberg/status/775109381302157312\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Nothing to see here, just <a href=\"https://twitter.com/wikileaks\">@Wikileaks</a> actively stoking insane conspiracy theories about Hillary&#39;s pneumonia <a href=\"https://t.co/M18r8KnEcE\">pic.twitter.com/M18r8KnEcE</a></p>&mdash; (((Yair Rosenberg))) (@Yair_Rosenberg) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Yair_Rosenberg/status/775109381302157312\">September 11, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>At about 11am, the press covering Clinton were told she had gone to her daughter Chelsea\u2019s apartment nearby, after feeling \u201coverheated\u201d. Near the same time, the campaign suddenly told reporters that there was a \u201ctypo\u201d in its original statement. </p> <p>An aide had originally said Clinton attended the ceremony for \u201cjust an hour and 30 minutes\u201d when she felt \u201coverheated\u201d and left to go to her daughter\u2019s apartment. The statement was quickly amended \u2013 to remove the word \u201cjust\u201d.<br></p> <p>The press, who had been kept in a pen at the ceremony and did not leave with Clinton\u2019s motorcade, was brought to Chelsea\u2019s apartment in time to see the candidate emerge. Wearing dark sunglasses, Clinton waved and smiled, even pausing to greet a young girl who ran up to her.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m feeling great,\u201d Clinton told the reporters gathered at the apartment. \u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful day in New York.\u201d</p> <p>As the morning wore on, a video surfaced of Clinton appearing to stumble and lose her balance as secret service agents lifted her into a van. Such footage was unlikely to quell questions about her health and stamina. Her campaign would not then confirm whether Clinton had seen, or was planning to see, a doctor. </p> <p>Hours later, at 5.15pm, the campaign reported that Clinton had been examined by her longtime doctor after returning to her home in Chappaqua. A statement from Clinton\u2019s doctor, Lisa Bardack, revealed that the candidate had been diagnosed with pneumonia during follow-up evaluation of a prolonged cough. </p> <p>In the intervening hours, partisans had taken to their battlefield lines and tried to make sense of how a simple story \u2013 a candidate fell ill over the course of an exhausting, 18-month election \u2013 could spiral so out of control.</p> <p>John Weaver, a Republican strategist and top adviser to the Ohio governor John Kasich, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JWGOP/status/775113869282807808\">wrote on Twitter</a> that it was the Clintons\u2019 controlling tendencies that had created the controversy. The \u201cClinton habit of dissembling on items [is] keeping her from putting this away\u201d, he wrote. \u201cBut media [is] giving Trump a pass on lies, tax [and] health details.\u201d</p> <p>Another conservative strategist, Rick Wilson, commented that the Clintons \u201c<a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheRickWilson/status/775087834667552768\">can\u2019t help it</a>\u201d when reporters wondered aloud why the campaign would not have simply notified the public that the candidate had fallen ill. </p> <p>A former adviser to Barack Obama, Dan Pfeiffer, wrote that such illnesses were mundane affairs during long campaigns. \u201cEvery candidate I have ever worked for has gotten sick on the trail and worked through it because you can\u2019t take days off in a close race,\u201d he <a href=\"https://twitter.com/danpfeiffer/status/775088444112416768\">wrote</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/NickMerrill/status/773003053905612800\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Dear <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AndrewNBCNews\">@AndrewNBCNews</a>-<br><br>Get a life.<br><br>Thanks.<br><br>Nick<br> <a href=\"https://t.co/Qbj6OI6Ypf\">https://t.co/Qbj6OI6Ypf</a></p>&mdash; Nick Merrill (@NickMerrill) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NickMerrill/status/773003053905612800\">September 6, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Last week, the Clinton campaign pushed back hard against rumors about her health.

  "<p>Hello guzzlers,</p> <p>I\u2019ve now been writing this puzzle blog for more than a year, and it\u2019s been great fun. Today I have news! I have compiled a book of my favourite puzzles. <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/can-you-solve-my-problems.html/?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\">Can You Solve My Problems? A Casebook of Ingenious, Perplexing and Totally Satisfying Puzzles </a>will be out in November. It contains 125 puzzles along with historical and mathematical background. I\u2019ve unearthed some hidden gems for you, I promise, and almost none of them has been featured on this blog before.</p> <p>So, I thought that today I\u2019d set some puzzles on a bookish theme. The first is about actual books. The second and third link words and numbers. And if you can solve the final one, you may win a copy of my book when it comes out. Here we go:</p> <blockquote> <p>1) Volumes I, II and III of a dictionary are stacked vertically side by side on a shelf, in that order and with spines visible in the normal way. The thickness of the pages in each volume is 6cm, and the thickness of the cover of each volume is 5mm. </p> <p>What is the horizontal distance from the first page of Volume I to the final page of Volume III?</p> <p>Clarification: by horizontal distance I mean what you would expect me to mean, which is the distance along the shelf, in other words the distance parallel to the edge of the shelf</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>2) Count upwards from ZERO thinking about the letters used in the names of numbers. The letter F appears for the first time in <strong>F</strong>OUR. The letter A first appears in ONE HUNDRED <strong>A</strong>ND ONE. </p> <p>Keep on counting, noting the first appearance of each letter in the names of numbers. What is the final letter that you will note down? In other words, when counting upwards, what is the final letter to appear in the name of a number?</p> </blockquote> <p>I thought it would be fun to see how many people get the answers right. So submit your answers here, and I\u2019ll have the results later at 5pm BST.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"puzzle\">  <iframe src= \"https://guardiannewsampampmedia.formstack.com/forms/puzzle\" width=100% height=400px></iframe> </figure>  <p>Here\u2019s the third question.</p> <blockquote> <p>3) The following statement is correct</p> <p><em>&lt; F is the first and the seventh letter of this sentence.&gt;</em></p> <p>Using the sentence above as a model, fill in the gap in the following sentence to make it correct:</p> <p><em>&lt;C is the first and the [...] letter of this sentence.&gt;</em></p> </blockquote> <p>I\u2019ll be back at 5pm with the answer.

  "<p>\u201cAny other star,\u201d says Guido Harari, \u201cwould have gone crazy. They\u2019d have probably thrown me out.\u201d It was 1am one night in 1989 and the Italian had been photographing Kate Bush non-stop for 15 hours. \u201cWe hadn\u2019t eaten. We weren\u2019t really talking. Just shoot, costume change, more makeup, shoot, costume change, more makeup, shoot.\u201d You worked in silence? \u201cYes. It was like we had telepathic communication.\u201d</p> <p>Bush had asked Harari to do the official photo shoot for her new album The Sensual World. And then, in the early hours, Harari had a bright idea. \u201cI thought she looked like the figurehead of a ship. So I would make her look as though she was swimming towards the camera underwater.\u201d </p> <p>Harari decided to create this image by shooting Bush in a Romeo Gigli dress in front of a rented painted backdrop that looked like a Pollock painting. Then he would ask her to step out of the shot, rewind the film on his Hasselblad camera and shoot the backdrop again, making it look like she was a swimming through a submarine world of drips and blobs. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"ae851b7213225873b1bd78edc834a41f8200e071\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ae851b7213225873b1bd78edc834a41f8200e071/0_0_3223_4724/682.jpg\" alt=\"Kate Bush on a trampoline in 1993.\" width=\"682\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kate Bush on a trampoline in 1993.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Guido Harari</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And then he had another idea. Why not have two images of Kate Bush on the same frame? \u201cAnd then I thought: why only two Kates? Why not three Kates \u2013 all swimming in the water? She had to stand really still so she wouldn\u2019t go out of focus because I was using a wide aperture, so there was no depth of field. She had to walk out of the shot, then back in, stand very still, and do the same again. I knew it was going to be great but it was going to take time and patience \u2013 and you don\u2019t get either often from famous people when you\u2019re photographing them.\u201d</p> <p>Isn\u2019t that when her PR minder should have intervened and said: Guido, enough already? \u201cWell yes! But there was no minder. She was never part of what she called the machine.\u201d As we chat, Harari shows me shots from his new book The Kate Inside, which documents his 10 years photographing the British pop star. It shows her wearing a T-shirt that says: I am a prima donna. \u201cMy God,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve worked with some real prima donnas, not to mention any names. She wasn\u2019t one of them.\u201d Indeed, there is a copy of her handwritten thank you note which says: \u201cYou\u2019ve made me look great.\u201d</p> <p>Harari has made his name over the years with disarmingly odd images of musicians. <a href=\"http://www.wallofsoundgallery.com/en/leonard-cohen-by-guido-harari-leonard-cohen-C-milan-C-.-i2841\">Leonard Cohen asleep</a> on a little table before a huge painting; <a href=\"http://www.snapgalleries.com/news/tom-waits-by-guido-harari/\">Tom Waits</a> strutting in an improbably voluminous cape; <a href=\"http://www.snapgalleries.com/shop/product.asp?P_ID=3053\">Laurie Anderson and Lou Reed</a> in a moment of tenderness, her nuzzling nose disappearing into his open shirt. Harari was a Kate Bush fan from the first time he heard her first single, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1pMMIe4hb4\">Wuthering Heights</a>, on the radio in 1978. \u201cShe was a pioneer, especially in Britain where no solo female artist had had a number one-selling album until she came along.

The choreographer had trained the teenage Kate Bush in the mid-1970s, becoming a mentor to her, as he had been for David Bowie. \u201cSo my book was like a calling card \u2013 showing her that I understood where she was coming from artistically.\u201d </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"30395784de373e9de53befe77e4e066b191d79c3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/30395784de373e9de53befe77e4e066b191d79c3/58_53_3075_4655/661.jpg\" alt=\"Choreographer Lindsay Kemp, with Kate Bush in curlers, during the filming of The Line, The Cross and the Curve.\" width=\"661\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Choreographer Lindsay Kemp, with Kate Bush in curlers, during the filming of The Line, The Cross and the Curve.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Guido Harari</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Three years later, Bush called, asking if he would do the official shoot for her album Hounds of Love. \u201cI went to meet her at her parents\u2019 farmhouse in Kent. She had built a 48-track studio. One thing that really struck me was that there was no glass between the control room and where the musicians recorded. It was a place of silence and retreat from the rock\u2019n\u2019roll world. She had no desire to go to parties or be famous. Instead, she had her family around her. Her father was her manager and her brother had taken photos for her previous albums.\u201d</p> <p>For the Hounds of Love shoot, Bush told Harari that she would bring clothes that would be brown, blue and gold. \u201cNothing else! No other clues! So I got some backdrops I thought would go with those colours, and at 8am she turned up at the studio with her makeup woman and a few outfits and we went to work.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2016/sep/12/behind-the-scenes-with-kate-bush-guido-harari\">Trampolines and tees: behind the scenes with Kate Bush \u2013\u00a0in pictures</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Most of the photographs in Harari\u2019s book have never been seen before. \u201cThere are lots of outtakes.

The way she\u2019s goofy one minute and then posing the next.\u201d</p> <p>After doing the photography for Hounds of Love and The Sensual World, in 1993 Harari was asked to be the stills photographer for her 50-minute film The Line, The Cross and the Curve starring Miranda Richardson, Lindsay Kemp and Bush, and showcasing songs from Bush\u2019s album The Red Shoes. \u201cIt was a great invitation because I could be a fly on the wall. No fancy set ups, just me recording what was happening.\u201d He\u2019s particularly proud of his shot of Bush asleep on set in her curlers with Kemp posing behind her head. \u201cI know she was disappointed in the film, she maybe thought it was a flop - not commercially but for her. So the photos were never published.\u201d</p> <p>That shoot marked the end of their collaboration, but there could have been another chapter. In 1998, Bush phoned Harari and asked if he would photograph her with guitarist Danny McIntosh and their newborn son, Bertie. \u201cI said, \u2018No. This is a private moment, keep it as it is.\u2019\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fbbb9104dd238a74249063bec4ac57980e1f03b8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fbbb9104dd238a74249063bec4ac57980e1f03b8/0_0_4724_4671/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kabuki Kate Bush, from the Hounds of Love shoot, 1985.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"989\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kabuki Kate, from the Hounds of Love shoot, 1985.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Guido Harari</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Harari goes back to that Hounds of Love shoot, recalling Bush\u2019s rapid transformations.

And then she disappeared again and I wondered where she was, so I went to the dressing room. And there she was sitting in a chair in this thick white Kabuki make up.

  "<p>Trying to hate the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/bridget-jones-s-baby\" title=\"\">third Bridget Jones film</a> is like trying to sulk while a toddler is tickling you: if it\u2019s hard to take against Ren\u00e9e Zellweger in any guise, it\u2019s simply not viable when she\u2019s lip-syncing to House of Pain. As she paces round her yard of failures, and ends \u201cat least I\u2019m finally thin,\u201d it\u2019s hard to take against that too. Comic talent leaps from the screen like frogs out of a box. Why was I even trying to hate it? Because it was Bridget Jones, and in the 1990s, that\u2019s what we did.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/mar/27/bridget-jones-no-longer-everywoman\">Bridget Jones was just like us. Not any more\u2026 | Barbara Ellen</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Before the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/bridget-jones-diary\" title=\"\">first film</a> we complained about the column, then the book, on feminist grounds. Finally, a character had arrived who didn\u2019t embody a prissy femininity of self-control, but in its place was a constant hum of trivia and calories and incompetence. She couldn\u2019t do anything. She couldn\u2019t make soup, she couldn\u2019t stay upright, she had all the agency and independence of a gosling, she was always at her most loveable when she was showing her knickers. It was as though there was so much fear in rejecting the classic female ideal of decorum that we had to crawl on our hands and knees to be accepted some other way. Inconveniently, she was often very funny. But funny could wait until we\u2019d smashed the patriarchy. That was wrong. No, let me try that again. I was wrong. The self-abasement and the humour were inextricable, and contained a subtle liberation that it was a big mistake to undervalue. Big mistake, to quote another politically problematic but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/pretty-woman\" title=\"\">deceptively important film</a>: huge.</p> <p>The first Bridget Jones film came out in 2001, by which time there was a kind of meta-disapproval for Zellweger, as the envoy of US body fascism trying to ape British slatternliness. How can you tear down the cultural constraint of female perfectionism with a heroine who battles constantly with her thighs and drinks wine in pints, and not at least check first whether or not Kate Winslet is available? The distinction between herself as an actor and herself qua casting decision seemed lost on Zellweger, <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/renee-zellweger/we-can-do-better_b_11355000.html\" title=\"\">who was extremely vexed at the column inches devoted to her appearance, and has remained so</a>. In retrospect, I can see why. It\u2019s hard not to take things personally when they\u2019re literally all about your person.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"d4b79e19c9201f1b358134786b2361abeabcd07f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d4b79e19c9201f1b358134786b2361abeabcd07f/0_0_1978_3000/659.jpg\" alt=\"Ren\u00e9e Zellweger in Bridget Jones\u2019s Diary\" width=\"659\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bridget Jones\u2019s Diary.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Working Title/Sportsphoto Ltd</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But seeing the third film makes me realise how much there is to miss about the 1990s politically. Bridget is now 43, and gets accidentally pregnant after two one-night stands, too close together to figure out whose child it is. I probably just about have it in me not to say who the father is, between Colin Firth\u2019s Mark and Patrick Dempsey\u2019s Jack, but otherwise take it as read that this piece will be riddled with spoilers.</p> <p>Immediately, the film made me miss sex-positive feminism. There was a time, towards the end of the last century, when we rejected the word \u201cslut\u201d not because it was victim-blaming but because there was no victim. The charge of sluttishness simply made no sense. A woman might choose to get drunk and have sex with a stranger, and it might not be a cry for help or a violation, it might not have meaning, she might not have low self-esteem, she might just feel like it.</p> <p>She might be charting the exhilarating waters of her own sexual destiny or she might just be passing the time. She couldn\u2019t be made to feel ashamed, not because the Daily Mail didn\u2019t try, but because shame is a two-way street and she didn\u2019t have it in her. Sex didn\u2019t have to be a transaction, with a winner and a loser (or two losers), as it is in Girls; it didn\u2019t even have to be an idealised transaction resulting in mutually satisfied participants, in the manner of Sex and the City. It could exist entirely outside the framework of investment and return, use and exploitation, in the space we used to call life.</p> <p>I miss the jokes. At one point in Bridget Jones\u2019s Baby, Bridget\u2019s gay friend announces he\u2019s adopting, and says: \u201cWe\u2019re having a baby. A gayby\u201d. That joke could only be made because it was seeded in a more ludic time. You wouldn\u2019t write that in a story first conceived today, because someone would think it infantilised same sex relationships, and someone else would think it implied that gay parents tried to preach homosexuality to their children, and some other someone would think it sexualised babies.</p> <p>Which may not sound like a huge loss, because it\u2019s just a piece of silly wordplay, but it is a loss: the ability to take a joke is a fundamental, perhaps defining, component of social legitimacy and confidence. When we all have to be as sensitive as our most sensitive ally, we cram into an ever tighter cultural corner, pearl-clutching, offence-taking, acting out the humourlessness of which liberals were always mischievously accused.</p> <p>And I miss <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/emma-thompson\" title=\"\">Emma Thompson</a>; or rather, I miss the kinds of roles for which only Emma Thompson will do, caustic, intelligent, sceptical, warm. Try to imagine Theresa May explaining to Emma Thompson why she needed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/sep/09/theresa-may-to-end-ban-on-new-grammar-schools\" title=\"\">grammar schools</a>, or a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/oct/31/go-home-vans-11-leave-britain\" title=\"\">van telling immigrants to go home</a> or face arrest; it\u2019s really enjoyable.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The ability to take a joke is a fundamental, perhaps defining, component of social legitimacy and confidence</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>More than any of that, I miss fecklessness, the ability to accept error as part of the human condition, without trying to stratify it by class or gender and write it off as the kind of thing only undesirable people are capable of. What contemporary political narrative would Bridget Jones fit into, in her current situation? She\u2019s not a scrounger; she\u2019s not a troubled family; she\u2019s not a benefits cheat. (She probably is, for a time, a drain on the NHS.)</p> <p>But nor is she a hard-working family, or a striver. She\u2019s not having a baby because she planned it, or can afford it, or has a brilliant maternity package, or lives near an outstanding primary school. She couldn\u2019t begin to justify her decision, couldn\u2019t even dignify it with the word, it\u2019s more of a happenstance. She doesn\u2019t match any of the criteria of a decent citizen in our current politics; but that\u2019s a fault in the politics, which is kept afloat by a po-faced self-righteousness that can\u2019t brook a joke in case empathy and fellowship come rushing in alongside it.</p> <p>The real work of building a \u201ccountry that works for all\u201d consists not of standing greyly by and intoning it, but of being able to see a person in wildly inauspicious circumstances, entirely of their own making, and feeling for them; knowing it could be you; wanting to help. That was the subversive element of Bridget Jones \u2013 her every pratfall built a deeper collective bond and made a narrow, judgmental, me-first worldview more absurd, more laughable, more impossible to maintain. She returns, like Batman, just when we need her most.</p>",
  "<p>Lukla, a strip of tarmac that sheers off the edge of a narrow valley in Nepal\u2019s Himalayas, is widely considered the world\u2019s most dangerous airport. But for bush pilot Matt Dearden, who flies the rugged and often uncharted terrain of Indonesian New Guinea, landing on muddy ridgelines and vertiginous, hand-dug slopes, Lukla holds no fear.</p> <p>\u201cLukla\u2019s a piece of cake,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a big tarmac runway. It\u2019s pretty long.

On a Sunday, out of the blue, he received an email asking him to start in 10 days.<br></p> <p>The boss of his small company, which had just seven staff, was remarkably understanding. So Dearden worked one last week, booked flights to Jakarta, packed what he could into a bag and began navigating Indonesia\u2019s storm-swept, tropical skies.</p> <p>Many of Indonesia\u2019s 17,000-odd islands are home to tiny communities isolated from the rest of the nation by distance or terrain, making access to schools, markets, government offices and even medical care almost impossible. So the government runs heavily subsidised pioneer flights to connect some of these remote outposts to the wider world. Dearden began flying these routes and, while working in New Guinea, fell in love with a plane: the nine-seater, three-wheeled Pilatus Porter.<br></p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a proper pilot\u2019s aircraft. You\u2019ve only got one pilot on board so you\u2019re your own commander,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s known among pilots as this beast of an aircraft that can land on anything you want to call an airstrip and descend through the smallest gap in the clouds.

So if you get a plane that hops over the valley or even over the peak and to the next valley it can save a lot of time and effort.\u201d<br></p> <p>Airstrip building in Indonesian New Guinea\u2019s interior, where people lived without the wheel or metal and had minimal contact with outsiders until around 70 years ago, is a communal effort. Villagers, many of whom will never have seen a plane, work together to clear and sculpt landing strips, a process that can take many years: the first flight into a village is a spectacular event for locals.<br></p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ll land and everyone will dance and chant and run around the aeroplane, shaking your hands,\u201d Dearden said. \u201cThere\u2019ll be a presentation where they all sit down \u2013 you\u2019ll usually fly in some kind of official to make an official opening \u2013 and they\u2019ll give gifts varying from net bags to live chickens. The chickens are quite a big honour.\u201d<br></p> <p>Taking off with such brand new fliers, many of whom have never travelled in any kind of vehicle, can present its challenges.

For the portrait, she adds the finishing touches, first pulling on a navy Team GB hoodie and then, after digging around in the side pocket of a Louis Vuitton rucksack, her latest gold medal, which she pulls out of a thick black sock. \u201cStops it getting scratched,\u201d she says, flashing me that Tinker Bell smile and looping it around her neck.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b704ba6998c50af6d0ee2cc8c22e5630a0ae9e3b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b704ba6998c50af6d0ee2cc8c22e5630a0ae9e3b/0_0_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Adams v Sarah Ourahmoune in the women\u2019s flyweight final at Rio.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Adams v Sarah Ourahmoune in the women\u2019s flyweight final at Rio.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Owen Humphreys/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Boxing is big on mythology, and the boxing club on a King\u2019s Cross backstreet that we are borrowing as a portrait studio has gritty glamour in spades.

It is not at any point made explicit in what capacity Esparza is here, but it\u2019s hard not to notice her, with her Texan drawl, bright splashy leggings, supersized eyelash extensions. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9bcb12fd0ed2c54f657f2636561e75f99e47ac9f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9bcb12fd0ed2c54f657f2636561e75f99e47ac9f/0_56_6115_3670/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Adams and Esparza at premiere of Bridget Jones\u2019s Baby in London.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Adams and Esparza at premiere of Bridget Jones\u2019s Baby in London.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dave J Hogan/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Adams has talked about having a girlfriend who wasn\u2019t able to be with her in Rio, but hasn\u2019t named her. Towards the end of our interview, I ask her why her partner couldn\u2019t join her, and she tells me: \u201cShe\u2019s an athlete as well, so she had her own commitments, and I understand that.\u201d Which sport, I ask, and she just says, \u201cboxing\u201d. Then she fixes me with that level stare, daring me to look over her shoulder to Esparza, sitting a few feet away doing emails on her laptop. The penny drops. Later, I look up their social media: there are regular photos of the two together, including selfies on both accounts from the red carpet of the Bridget Jones\u2019s Baby premiere, complete with lipstick and hearts-for-eyes emoji.</p> <p>The electric energy of Adams in the ring is belied by her laidback, non-confrontational persona outside. She and Esparza arrived late to our shoot, because their taxi driver had a scrape with a lorry that necessitated a fraught and lengthy exchange of insurance details; then he got lost looking for the gym, but refused to accept navigational help until Esparza insisted. Had she not intervened, the American says, Adams would have let the taxi drive around in circles endlessly rather than make a scene.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"0c2d5b82e72eb3577d02ed3f1bacf8b2eef94406\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0c2d5b82e72eb3577d02ed3f1bacf8b2eef94406/117_0_2717_1631/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Adams celebrates after winning gold at the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Adams celebrates after winning gold at the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Russell Cheyne/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Esparza arrives a bit rattled by this start to the day. But Adams poses serenely for her portrait, submits gracefully to a protracted selfie session with the gym regulars, and does not stop smiling during the hour that we are talking. Her smile is something of a trademark. Does she do it to unsettle the competition? \u201cWell, I guess when I\u2019m smiling, waving to the crowd, looking really happy, an opponent is going to look at me and think \u2013 wow, is she even nervous? But really, I\u2019m just enjoying myself.\u201d Much of her persona \u2013 the smile, the Frosties she refuses to give up for breakfast \u2013 has this upbeat, almost childlike tone.</p> <p>Right now, she is on her post-Olympic holiday. For two months, she can rest, see friends, relax her diet, cut training right down to four hour-long sessions a week. What is the part about this that she relishes the most \u2013 lie-ins? Eating cake? Going out at night? \u201cAll of that! Definitely the lie-ins. And the cake. And going out clubbing. But mostly it\u2019s just nice to see friends and family, and catch up with what is going on in their lives, before I\u2019m back in training lockdown.\u201d</p> <p>Taking gold at a home Olympics in 2012, with women\u2019s boxing included for the first time, was hard to beat. But her Rio medal was just as sweet, Adams says, because after overcoming a serious shoulder injury, \u201cthis four years taught me a lot about my mental strength\u201d. She didn\u2019t get to see much of Rio on this trip, because she was competing in the last week and was \u201cliving and breathing boxing training\u201d, but she got to go to Christ the Redeemer when she visited Rio with David Cameron after the 2012 Olympics. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"809eaebc722c61510169c9206843a5095a04e628\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/809eaebc722c61510169c9206843a5095a04e628/0_117_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"With her gold medal in Rio.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With her gold medal in Rio.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Owen Humphreys/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>She always thought Team GB would do well in Rio, she says, \u201cbecause we have the funding and facilities now.

I\u2019m only happy with gold</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Adams was in San Diego this summer when she heard Muhammad Ali had died. \u201cI was really upset that I\u2019d never got to meet him, to say to him: you are the reason I wanted to win an Olympic gold medal.\u201d Her first memory of boxing is watching a video of the Rumble in the Jungle with her dad. \u201cI remember how he performed in the ring, but how he was in interviews as well. His charisma, his charm, his cheekiness, his poetry. I just loved all that. He was an entertainer, and I\u2019ve taken a lot of that into my boxing. I like to see the crowd enjoying themselves. If they\u2019re happy, I\u2019m happy.\u201d A few years later, aged 12, she went to the boxing gym for the first time when her mum Dee, by then a single parent, needed somewhere she could leave Nicola while she went to aerobics. \u201cThere were kids doing pads, some shadow-boxing, some in the ring. It was really cool, I loved it.\u201d Was it not a bit intimidating, for a 12-year-old girl? She looks a bit nonplussed. \u201cUm, no. Not at all. It was exciting.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e652b5475b425f41be0718f59543a69276a2118a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e652b5475b425f41be0718f59543a69276a2118a/297_0_1578_948/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The flyweight final at London 2012.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The flyweight final at London 2012.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murad Sezer/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Her first competition was a year later \u2013 \u201cI won\u201d \u2013 but the first opponent she remembers vividly was Sofya Ochigava, who she boxed in the 2007 European Championships. \u201cIn the last 30 seconds I was one point up, and I was just about to be European champion. I got excited, I lost my focus, and I switched off for half a second. She scored two points, and I ended up with a silver.\u201d That silver was the first medal won by an English woman at a major international championship, but Adams doesn\u2019t remember it as an achievement. \u201cI was devastated. I never go to a tournament thinking, I\u2019ll be happy just to win a medal. I\u2019m only happy with gold.\u201d</p> <p>Adams came through the ranks with no female role models. She dealt with this by adopting the philosophy of her coach, who on her first day in the gym told her: \u201cIn this gym, there\u2019s no male or female. You\u2019re just a boxer.\u201d In other gyms, though, sexism was the norm in the early part of Adams\u2019s career. \u201cJust stuff like, you\u2019d go to a gym and the guys would do eight three-minute stints on the bags, and then the women would just do five. Like, because we\u2019re women we can\u2019t do the full eight! Ha.\u201d The Olympics have had a huge impact on attitudes to female boxing, she says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"29d1027a3e2c145cced25b2b541d9c07d4d342a0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/29d1027a3e2c145cced25b2b541d9c07d4d342a0/0_51_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ringside at the Times ABC.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ringside at the Times ABC.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Saker/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As has Adams herself. Boxing has always had a strong aesthetic iconography, but strictly a male one. There hasn\u2019t been a beautiful, glamorous female boxer before now. <a href=\"http://www.vogue.co.uk/article/nicola-adams-british-vogue-interview-quotes\">Adams has been profiled in Vogue</a>, and starred in <a href=\"http://www.nicola-adams.com/10-press/20-m-s-launches-campaign-celebrating-britain-s-leading-ladies\">a Marks &amp; Spencer fashion campaign</a>. (That was fun, apparently, because Helen Mirren turned out to be a huge boxing fan.) Recently, Adams upgraded the braided hairstyle she wore in 2012 for a more stylised look, with a high quiff offset by intricately patterned shaved sides. It requires a visit to the hairdresser once a week. (\u201cI like it to look sharp.\u201d) </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/jun/19/nicola-adams-gold-mcdonalds-for-the-hell-of-it-olympic-boxing\">Nicola Adams: \u2018After I won gold, I went to McDonald\u2019s for the hell of it\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The success of women\u2019s boxing has popularised the sport as fitness \u2013 the Instagram feed of any ambitious young model will feature the obligatory gloved-up gym selfie \u2013 but Adams is more interested in seeing women\u2019s pro boxing televised. \u201cThat would change the game. I\u2019d love to help make that happen,\u201d she says.</p> <p>She waves away the notion that she might worry about the impact of boxing on her brain. But then, her worst injury \u2013 one that kept her in bed for three months, and out of the ring for a year, and very nearly prevented her taking part in trials for London 2012 \u2013 came from falling down the stairs. Getting back to fitness was \u201calmost like learning to walk again\u201d, she says. \u201cI went from doing 300 sit-ups a day to not being able to lift my shoulders off the floor.\u201d </p> <p>Crucially, though, she never lost her self-belief. \u201cBoxing is 50/50, mental and physical. You can be the strongest, fastest, most technical boxer out there, but if you\u2019re not there mentally, you won\u2019t win. You see boxers who look unbelievable in the gym, and then they get into the ring and they fall to pieces. The mental aspect is about how to stay in control, to get your opponent to make mistakes and then to capitalise on them. It\u2019s a bit like chess, really.\u201d She has played chess since she was 10 years old.</p> <p>After 2012, she says, the decision to pursue further Olympic success over a professional career was simple. \u201cI knew straight away I wanted the double gold. I wanted to make history.\u201d Now \u2013 four years older, with fewer years ahead \u2013 she faces the same decision again, and she\u2019s not giving anything away. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot to think about,\u201d is her deliberately oblique answer. \u201cI\u2019ll make a decision by the end of the year about what the next chapter will be.\u201d </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"e0011f0a064539f64c2013d2a70629e52470de5d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e0011f0a064539f64c2013d2a70629e52470de5d/47_0_1407_844/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nicola Adams appearing in Waterloo Road.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Appearing in Waterloo Road.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"http://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/nicola-adams-reveals-turn-acting-8544311\">Acting will play a bit part</a>, at least.

  "<p>Teenagers in America are resorting to sex work because they cannot afford food, according to <a href=\"http://www.urban.org/research/publication/impossible-choices-teens-and-food-insecurity-america\">a study</a> that suggests widespread hunger in the world\u2019s wealthiest country.</p> <p>Focus groups in all 10 communities analysed by the <a href=\"http://www.urban.org/\">Urban Institute</a>, a Washington-based thinktank, described girls \u201cselling their body\u201d or \u201csex for money\u201d as a strategy to make ends meet. Boys desperate for food were said to go to extremes such as shoplifting and selling drugs.</p> <p>The findings raise questions over the legacy of Bill Clinton\u2019s landmark <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/08/22/the-enduring-legacy-of-welfare-reform-20-years-later/\">welfare-reform legislation</a> 20 years ago as well as the spending priorities of Congress and the impact of slow wage growth. Evidence of teenage girls turning to \u201ctransactional dating\u201d with older men is likely to cause particular alarm.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve been doing research in low-income communities for a long time, and I\u2019ve written extensively about the experiences of women in high poverty communities and the risk of sexual exploitation, but this was new,\u201d said <a href=\"http://www.urban.org/author/susan-j-popkin\">Susan Popkin</a>, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute and lead author of the report, Impossible Choices.</p> <p>\u201cEven for me, who has been paying attention to this and has heard women tell their stories for a long time, the extent to which we were hearing about food being related to this vulnerability was new and shocking to me, and the level of desperation that it implies was really shocking to me. It\u2019s a situation I think is just getting worse over time.\u201d<br></p> <p>The qualitative study, carried out in partnership with the food banks network <a href=\"http://www.feedingamerica.org/\">Feeding America</a>, created two focus groups \u2013 one male, one female \u2013 in each of 10 poor communities across the US. The locations included big cities such as Chicago, Los Angeles and Washington and rural North Carolina and eastern Oregon. A total of 193 participants aged 13 to 18 took part and were allowed to remain anonymous.</p> <p>Their testimony paints a picture of teenagers \u2013 often overlooked by policymakers focused on children aged zero to five \u2013 missing meals, making sacrifices and going hungry, with worrying long-term consequences.</p> <p>Popkin said: \u201cWe heard the same story everywhere, a really disturbing picture about hunger and food insecurity affecting the wellbeing of some of the most vulnerable young people. The fact that we heard it everywhere from kids in the same way tells us there\u2019s a problem out there that we should be paying attention to.\u201d</p> <p>The consistency of the findings across gender, race and geography was a surprise. </p> <p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t sure we would see it,\u201d Popkin said. \u201cKids knew about all these strategies: hanging around your friend\u2019s house and see if they\u2019ll feed you, going hungry so that their younger brothers and sisters could eat, saving their school lunch so they could eat it at night so they could sleep at night. </p> <p>\u201cEverybody knew where you get the cheapest food and how you keep some emergency stuff in your house. It was just very matter-of-fact and very common, in the richest country in the world.\u201d</p> <p>In every community, and in 13 of the 20 focus groups, there were accounts of sexual exploitation, often related with distaste. A girl in Portland, Oregon told researchers: \u201cIt\u2019s really like selling yourself. Like you\u2019ll do whatever you need to do to get money or eat.\u201d</p> <p>Another comment from Portland: \u201cYou\u2019re not even dating \u2026 they\u2019ll be like \u2026 \u2018I don\u2019t really love him, but I\u2019m going to do what I have to do.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Many prefer to rationalise what they are doing as dating of sorts. A boy in rural North Carolina said: \u201cWhen you\u2019re selling your body, it\u2019s more in disguise. Like if I had sex with you, you have to buy me dinner tonight \u2026 that\u2019s how girls deal with the struggle \u2026 That\u2019s better than taking money because if they take money, they will be labeled a prostitute.\u201d</p> <p>In seven of the 10 communities, teenagers told stories of girls exchanging sexual favours with strangers or stripping for money in abandoned houses, at flea markets and on the street. A girl in San Diego, California, said: \u201cSomeone I knew dropped out of high school to make money for the family. She felt the need to step up. She started selling herself.\u201d</p> <p>Another girl in Chicago told researchers of an 11-year-old girl who dropped out of sixth grade to work in the sex trade, while boys in Los Angeles described how middle school girls put up flyers in public places to advertise their services.</p> <p>In the communities with the highest poverty rates, both girls and boys steal food and other basics from local stores for themselves or their families. A male teenager in Chicago said: \u201cI ain\u2019t talking about robbing nobody. I\u2019m just talking like going there and get what you need, just hurry up and walk out, which I do \u2026 They didn\u2019t even know. If you need to do that, that\u2019s what you got to do, that\u2019s what you got to do.\u201d</p> <p>Some children begin stealing at the age of seven or eight, according to the focus groups. Boys mainly take items such as phones, shoes, jewelry and bikes. Selling drugs is also common. One in Los Angeles said: \u201cA lot of kids at a young age will sell drugs to get money for their families. People think it\u2019s good but it messes you up.\u201d</p> <p>Popkin, who has been researching distressed public housing communities for more than 25 years, explained: \u201cWith the boys there was a lot of hustling and shoplifting or maybe stealing a car stereo or something small they could sell. Getting pushed into drug dealing, sometimes getting pulled into gangs.</p> <p>\u201cI find it particularly disturbing that all the kids in almost every focus group were aware about what was happening to the girls \u2013 they knew the story about girls dating older guys or being exploited. The stories we heard were mostly about girls dating older men in order to get them to provide money for them for rent, for food, for clothes. They\u2019re just very vulnerable.\u201d</p> <p>She added: \u201cIt\u2019s a sexual exploitation. You hear about homeless teenagers engaging in transactional sex, you hear it about refugees. To hear it from stably housed kids in the United States is shocking and even if it\u2019s only a handful of kids, it should be something that we\u2019re paying attention to, that there are kids that desperate.\u201d</p> <p>Other key findings in the report include:</p> <ul> <li>Teens feel a sense of shame around hunger and hide it. Many refuse to accept food or assistance in public settings or from people outside a trusted circle of friends and family. </li> <li>Food-insecure teens think about how to mitigate their hunger and make food last longer for the whole family. They go to friends\u2019 or relatives\u2019 houses to eat and save their school lunch for the weekend.</li> <li>Parents try to protect teens from hunger and from bearing responsibility for providing for themselves or others. However, teens routinely take on this role, going hungry so younger siblings can eat or finding ways to bring in food and money.</li> <li>Teens would overwhelmingly prefer to earn money through a formal job but prospects for youth employment are extremely limited.</li> <li>In a few communities, teens talked about going to jail or failing school as strategies for ensuring regular meals.</li> </ul> <p>The report is not an attempt to provide national statistics but does cite research that estimates 6.8 million individuals aged 10 to 17 are in food-insecure households, including 2.9 million with very low food security.</p> <p>The Urban Institute\u2019s recommendations include improving the federal <a href=\"http://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/supplemental-nutrition-assistance-program-snap\">Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program</a>; expanding access to school-based meals for teens in summer months and after classes; creating more and better youth job opportunities; establishing community projects, such as one that has <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/180914463\">proved successful in Portland</a>; and helping rather than punishing girls who are sexually exploited.</p> <p>Popkin said: \u201cI think one of the things we see, particularly around girls, is that if they get caught up in the criminal justice system, they get treated as status offenders, so they get arrested and they get put in the system instead of receiving the help and support they should be having for being exploited. </p> <p>\u201cOne of the policy changes we advocate for in the report is a real shift in the perspective and getting kids help and support instead of a criminal record.\u201d</p>",

One only needs to log on to social media, stick a microphone in front of Melbourne club president or check the opinion pages of Victorian newspapers to know that. The charge the Giants often answer to is that they are, to use a growingly popular term of derision in these expansionist times, \u201cplastic\u201d \u2013 a contrived franchise. Handed the best players. Gifted their path to this moment.</p> <p>Well, not on Saturday they weren\u2019t. On their finals debut the Giants were earthy and spontaneous, callous and calculating. They literally drew blood from a more respected opponent and beat them on the scoreboard too. They were, to put it simply, a hell of a lot better at playing football than Sydney were. They ran in numbers, spread the ball around with skill and cunning, and were ruthless in every department a football side can be bar kicking at goal, which spared Sydney the blushes of outright humiliation.</p> <p>Johnson was central to this, playing perhaps the best no-goal, five-behind finals game a specialist forward has turned in given such heightened circumstances; a greenhorn club on its finals debut, in unfamiliar surrounds on an unstable surface, against one of the most famously disciplined and professional clubs in the competition. We often speak in wonder of the impact Cyril Rioli has on games outside what can be processed by statistics, but Johnson is comparable \u2013 a salt of the earth character with skills from outer space who can turn a game with a mere shake of his hips. Or the point of his shoulder, as was the case here.</p> <p>On Saturday Johnson ensured that nobody will ever again refer to the Giants as \u201cthe kids from GWS\u201d or \u201cupstarts\u201d. When he sized up Sydney ball-magnet Kennedy and crudely ironed him out he gave that game of football its tonal structure. It was a dirty act, it took out a respected \u201cball player\u201d and it might cost Johnson dearly from a personal standpoint, but it also said that he and his team stood for something, and that if anybody was going to be pushed around, it wasn\u2019t the newcomers.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/12/the-dawn-of-a-new-era-the-weekend-that-shook-the-afls-existing-order\">The dawn of a new era? The weekend that shook the AFL's existing order | Craig Little</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This GWS move was meant to be a career coda for Johnson \u2013 the point at which he aged gracefully and bowed out pragmatically as a quasi-coach before moving upstairs full-time with a clipboard in hand. Yet here, with a preliminary final spot on the line and undaunted by the passing of time and wearying of his legs, he was suddenly Vossian, Hodgian and Lethalsesque \u2013 singlehandedly affirming the kind of ruthless qualities premiership sides need. </p> <p>The Kennedy incident could in the end cost the Giants one of their best players, but what price the Giants\u2019 development of outlaw attitude and team identity in the hours that followed? By the end of the first quarter Johnson was like a one-man army as he ploughed into Franklin. The Giants veteran has a keen sense of the momentum and flow of games because so often, like here, he\u2019s been able to provide it all on his own.</p> <p>And this was really just the logical extension of what Johnson has done all season for his younger Giants team-mates; shown them and the rest of the competition that talent takes you only so far. In 2016 he\u2019s made the Giants more physically imposing, surer of themselves and perhaps a little arrogant, as opposed to merely precocious. He\u2019s brought talent, sure, but also what Martin Pike added to Brisbane\u2019s golden era sides: the sinking feeling for opponents that they\u2019re up against a gang.</p> <p>On Saturday it also can\u2019t have escaped Johnson that his opposition featured seven finals debutants who might be rocked watching one of their most experienced and reliable team-mates receiving a pre-meditated shirtfront and being helped from the ground. They\u2019d only be human if they thought twice about whether they themselves were the next in line for punishment. That sense of physical dominance only grew when Shane Mumford slung Swans star Kurt Tippett into the ground, giving him what looked like concussion to go with the broken jaw he\u2019d suffer in another contest.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/11/swans-lose-kurt-tippett-and-callum-mills-for-afl-semi-final-against-adelaide\">Swans lose Kurt Tippett and Callum Mills for AFL semi-final against Adelaide</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Of course the common thread between Mumford and Johnson is Geelong, who believed in them both as individuals when nobody else did. Mumford\u2019s contribution to the development of this Giants side is equally monumental as Johnson\u2019s, probably more so. In 2014 and 2015, during times when GWS really struggled, the ruckman was almost all that stood between total annihilation for the Giants. Without him they were a husk, perhaps more reliant on a single player than any club in the league bar Gold Coast with Gary Ablett.</p> <p>None of this is to say GWS couldn\u2019t have reached this point without the pair. Prior to 2016 they actually weren\u2019t low on spiky characters. Toby Greene, Devon Smith and Dylan Shiel all play like school bullies. But they needed a ringleader \u2013 which, as good as Callan Ward and Phil Davis have been, is often not a role that a captain can play and probably not one he should if he\u2019s forcing it. </p> <p>Johnson has been that catalyst. He\u2019s brought this side out of its shell. He\u2019s been the symbolic stiff-arm to the chest of so many opponents and now, come finals, he\u2019s given Greater Western Sydney the kind of fear factor and momentum that will trouble any opponent they face.</p> <p>On the weekend a tough, talented and battle-hardened Sydney side were dealt a psychic blow. Premiership sides have lost finals before \u2013 the Eagles famously stumbled on the way to the 2006 flag \u2013 but they haven\u2019t lost them like this. Sydney were bullied. \u201cThe Bloods\u201d, if they can still carry the flame of that mid-2000s sides, were made to bleed.</p> <p>The question now is whether the Giants, having hoped they\u2019d go all the way with Stevie J, can trust that something close to his potent mix of supreme talent and chutzpah has now spread through an entire football side. The way they\u2019re playing right now, Johnson\u2019s well-timed bump could be the moment that heralded a new dynasty.</p>",

They were transferred to a train and taken away to the missions.</p> <p>In the third scene, Purcell sang a song, <a href=\"http://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/mp/9460447.0004.202/--singing-trauma-trails-songs-of-the-stolen-generations?rgn=main;view=fulltext\">Run Daisy Run</a>, composed in English and her grandmother\u2019s tongue: \u201c<em>Wondah yarrmun taia nunni kurra mulli kai ngun ngun tulla yani yani.\u201d </em>(\u201cWhite man on horseback come and took my baby, where all I can do is cry.\u201d)</p> <p>Purcell found her calling at Murgon high school during a three-month musical theatre course.

The children\u2019s father was a white man, a butcher and leather and rope worker who lived on the other side of town. Married to a white woman, with whom he had two other children, her father had two families at once. Purcell would go into his butcher\u2019s shop and he would give her a wink and a chicken leg, but she wasn\u2019t allowed to call him \u201cDad\u201d.</p> <p>She remembers writing and directing an episode of TV series Redfern Now which first aired in 2013. Titled Consequences, it was based on her own life. In the story, an Indigenous woman and cultural anthropologist Mattie, played by Tammy Clarkson Jones, races to share news of her PhD with her estranged white father, a butcher named Jack, played by Craig McLachlan. Mattie asks Jack: \u201cWhy did you leave my mother?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFor a split second,\u201d recalls Purcell. \u201cThe sun came out, a ray hit Craig and his face sort of changed. I went, \u2018Is that my old man, standing there?\u2019 Craig almost lost it. Afterwards we walked up and held one another.

  "<p>Sydney lord mayor Clover Moore has downplayed the seemingly toxic relationship between Town Hall and the NSW state government as new projections show the population ballooning.</p> <p>Mike Baird\u2019s state government gave businesses two votes in the recent election, a move seen as likely to help Moore\u2019s opponents in Saturday\u2019s election. Previously, the state government passed legislation \u2013 labelled the \u201cget Clover laws\u201d \u2013 banning state MPs from sitting on local councils, forcing Moore to give up her seat in the NSW parliament.</p> <p>Both moves seemed to backfire, with Moore <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/11/clover-moore-re-elected-as-sydney-lord-mayor-after-apparent-backlash-against-baird\">winning the council election in a landslide</a> on Saturday.

But the new figures indicate it will have 292,350 people in 2031, and will balloon to 315,200 by 2036.</p> <p>By 2031, the Sydney metropolitan region will have more than 100,000 extra people, compared with the 2014 projections. That would mean a population of 6 million by 2031 and 6.4 million by 2036.</p> <p>By far the biggest growth would be in the outer south-western suburb of Camden, where the population was expected to almost triple by 2036, compared with 2011. Parramatta and the Hills district were the next biggest growers, each expected to roughly double in that period.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/31/nightlife-is-still-alive-and-well-do-critics-have-it-wrong-on-sydneys-lockout-laws\">'Nightlife is still alive and well': do critics have it wrong on Sydney's lockout laws?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>They were followed by Strathfield and Liverpool, each expected to grow by about 75%.</p> <p>The fashionable areas of Mosman on the north shore and Woollahra in the eastern suburbs were projected to grow the least in that period, expanding by 9.9% and 6.3% respectively.</p> <p>Planning minister Rob Stokes <a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/sydney-population-booms-and-the-only-way-is-up-and-in-20160911-grdv4b.html\">told Fairfax Media</a> the surprising figures were the \u201cgrowing pains of a great global city\u201d. </p> <p>He called for a \u201cBarcelona model\u201d of development, with a growth in medium density small houses, rather than the \u201cShanghai model\u201d, meaning a surge in huge apartment blocks.</p> <p>\u201cThere are going to be areas of towers [in] central parts, but we don\u2019t want that across the urban fabric,\u201d Stokes said.</p> <p>He said he would make it easier for developers to build terrace houses and small developments in established suburbs and the fringes of the city.</p>",
  "<p>My father was never much given to sentiment, nostalgia, spiritualism or superstition.</p> <p>He was practical and prosaic in belief and taste.

He used to scoff at what he regarded the oddness of nuns, especially at the traffic lights if they were behind the wheel of the next car. He certainly never believed in ghosts.</p> <p>Which is why I was flummoxed when he told me he\u2019d once seen his mother wandering around his old family home.

Perhaps he\u2019d just dreamt his mother. I don\u2019t know. But I do know that I dream of my parents often. I know they are dead. But in my dreams they are always alive and inside or around my home. My subconscious wants to keep them here, in my home.</p> <p>It\u2019s almost time to go now from this house that\u2019s been my cocoon for almost two decades. An archive of elation and celebration, of sorrow and disappointment, too, it\u2019s the place where I\u2019ve written six books and a million other words, many of them terrible but all of them from the heart of home.</p> <p>It\u2019s where we brought our newborns. And it\u2019s where we still, at certain times of the year, mourn one who never made it.</p> <p>Our dead parents are here, too, and in more than just our dreams. Yes, their images are on the walls, just as they will be wherever we go next. But their time lived in this house, the days and weeks and months when they marvelled at the children mostly just for their plain ordinariness (everyone, especially on Facebook, boasts that their kids are exceptional, right?) can only remain here.</p> <p>In some ways it\u2019s my mother-in-law whose presence I still feel \u2013 and miss \u2013 most acutely around this place. She always managed to fill the joint, such was her capacity to simultaneously solve any maths problem, recite the words to an obscure hymn, oversee piano practice, sew a button, iron a shirt, change a nappy and feed the dogs, all while nuking my favourite Le Creuset, before settling in at the kitchen bench while we talked about anything and drank wine as I cooked for the adults and chiselled the charcoal from the pot.</p> <p>The dead parents are fixed in my memories, in my experiences, only here, within these walls. Those who live here next, perhaps having abandoned their own ghosts, won\u2019t know any of that of course.</p> <p>And, so, I wonder: what happens to all of that life lived, ours and that of the departed, all of that human time expended here, when we move?</p> <p>One of my Indigenous mates reckons you should have a modest smoking ceremony when you leave a house and another at the other end when you settle into a new place. That makes sense to me: a smoking ceremony (by which I mean some smouldering gum leaves and jasmine in a dish, with no deliberate inhalation) to signal to ancestors that you\u2019re leaving and to please follow, and another in the new place to assure incumbent spirits you mean no harm.</p> <p>We haven\u2019t moved yet. But already I feel like I\u2019m cheating with all of this eyeing off of pretty places by the water where I might squeeze my (by necessity new, smaller) writing desk, stow our books and hang our art, where the dogs (and kids; not quite a secondary consideration) might romp happily. A place in which to live new experiences, accrue more memories, raise people and dogs, grow vegetables and flowers and books.</p> <p>There\u2019s so much stuff we can\u2019t take.</p> <p>Like the majestic golden ash out the back, the possum ladder to our roof, whose leaves clog our gutters each autumn.</p> <p>We carved our initials, the three of us, in the trunk when we moved in back in 1997: our older daughter, \u201c<em>EM</em>\u201d, and us adults leaner, darker-haired, less battered by life\u2019s vagaries and disappointments: \u201c<em>PD 4</em> <em>LT</em>\u201d.</p> <p>Soon came the \u201c<em>JD\u201d</em> of the boy, now almost 18. We didn\u2019t \u2013 couldn\u2019t \u2013 inscribe the initials of the baby who didn\u2019t make it, into the golden ash. It was, perhaps, a year later when we noticed the boy had taken it upon himself to write of our loss by carving grief into the trunk for all of us: \u201c<em>4 JD 4 ED</em> ...\u201d. Years later another living little girl, finally, at last, made the tree: \u201c... <em>4 CJ</em>.\u201d</p> <p>When our son was born we embarked on what we called \u201cthe 21-year project\u201d. The idea was that, like Michael Apted\u2019s Up series, we would chronicle on film, through interviews and footage, his life to age 21. Life \u2013 constant travel, juggling similar, though often uncomplementary, careers, supporting ailing parents and other kids \u2013 got in the way. We gave up when he was about three. But we did mark his growth with lines of pen and dates on the side of a bookcase that is fixed to one of the walls. Over the years all sorts of random visitors \u2013 friends, rellos, tradies \u2013 were marked off on the side of that bookcase.</p> <p>It was our visitor\u2019s book. It has to stay, I suppose.</p> <p>I\u2019m not at all handy. But I wonder if a hammer and chisel would do the trick. </p> <p>I\u2019m not much of a gardener, either. Our front is often the unruliest in what is, even by Canberra\u2019s standards, a rather ruly street. But our magnolia, which briefly blooms in a flourish of aubergine and white annually, is the most magnificent in the suburb. Every year the kids \u2013 from when they first appeared as bumps in their mother\u2019s belly \u2013 have been photographed beneath that blooming tree with their mum.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/08/ive-moved-house-more-than-60-times-here-are-six-things-ive-learned\">I've moved house more than 60 times.

But it\u2019s enough for the annual photograph.</p> <p>And as fate or life or circumstance or something would have it, the woman from the Australian Bureau of Statistics who\u2019s been leaving little notes for me for weeks, urging me to complete the ill-fated census, just knocked on the door again to ask if I\u2019d done it yet.

They\u2019ve met six times previously in grand slam play with four of those matches extending the five-set distance, none more memorable than their five-hour quarter-final epic at the 2013 Australian Open, which Djokovic won 12-10 in the fifth.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pleqYnR2JPo\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/pleqYnR2JPo?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Djokovic and Wawrinka went toe to toe in Melbourne three straight years including this 2013 epic.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Now they meet again in Queens with Djokovic trying for a 13th grand slam title and Wawrinka going for his third major title in many years.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57d5a0d7e4b013613fffc386\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-11T18:27:05.132Z\">7.27pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Bryan will be here shortly, in the meantime here\u2019s how the women\u2019s final unfolded on Saturday. </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Angelique Kerber was on the ropes in the third and deciding set of Saturday\u2019s US Open final, having fallen behind a break against the big-serving Czech Karolina Pliskova.</p> <p>But the second-seeded German fought back, showing the finishing kick of a champion in winning 24 of the last 34 points, and breaking Pliskova twice to seal a 6-3, 4-6, 6-4 victory for her first US Open championship and second grand slam title of the year.</p> <p>After Pliskova pounded a forehand long on championship point, Kerber collapsed in a heap on the baseline. Then she climbed into the players\u2019 box to embrace her coach Torben Beltz as the roars cascaded down from the promenade at the world\u2019s largest tennis stadium.</p> <p>The 28-year-old German, who was already due to supplant Serena Williams as the world No1 when \u2019s rankings are released, backed up that mantle by outlasting Pliskova over 2hr 7min at Arthur Ashe Stadium. She will become the oldest player to make her debut atop the rankings, besting a mark previously held by Jennifer Capriati by three years.</p> </blockquote> <p>You can read the full story below:</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/10/angelique-kerber-karolina-pliskova-us-open-final\">Angelique Kerber beats Karolina Pliskova in thrilling US Open final</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div>"
