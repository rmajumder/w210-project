  "<p>Some believe the duckbill \u2013 the sandstone rock formation at Cape Kiwanda state natural area on the Oregon coast \u2013 has existed since at least the early 1900s, withstanding sand storms, torrential downpours and countless yoga-posing tourists standing on it for an Instagram shot.</p> <p>But last week, the 7ft-by-10ft rock, which overlooked the ocean, crumbled when a group of vandals pushed the rock until it toppled. </p> <p>\u201cWe know the park erodes and its features don\u2019t last forever,\u201d said Chris Havel, with the Oregon state parks and recreation department. \u201cThe point of the park is we get to witness it change and enjoy it \u2013 but the human\u2019s role doesn\u2019t involve forcing the change.\u201d </p> <p>The rock formations can take thousands of years to develop naturally, Havel said, and thousands of years to naturally fall apart. Initially, the parks department assumed that\u2019s what happened. </p> <p>Until a video surfaced. </p> <p>David Kalas <a href=\"http://www.oregonlive.com/pacific-northwest-news/index.ssf/2016/09/video_shows_group_toppling_cap.html\">told the Oregonian</a> newspaper that he began filming when he noticed a group pushing the rock, causing it to sway. His video shows the group pushing the rock; once it topples, one of them yells, \u201cGot him.\u201d </p> <p>After the destruction, Kalas said, he approached the group, who told him that a friend had injured himself on the rock and called it a \u201csafety hazard\u201d. </p> <p>The beach below the landmark rock is a popular spot on the Oregon coast. There are tide pools, surfers and dory beach fisherman who use the area as a launching pad. </p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s one of those places that symbolizes everything that is wonderful about the Oregon coast,\u201d Havel said. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-instagram\"> <blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-version=\"7\" style=\" background:#FFF; border:0; border-radius:3px; box-shadow:0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width:658px; padding:0; width:99.375%; width:-webkit-calc(100% - 2px); width:calc(100% - 2px);\"><div style=\"padding:8px;\"> <div style=\" background:#F8F8F8; line-height:0; margin-top:40px; padding:33.3333333333% 0; text-align:center; width:100%;\"> <div style=\" background:url(data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAACwAAAAsCAMAAAApWqozAAAABGdBTUEAALGPC/xhBQAAAAFzUkdCAK7OHOkAAAAMUExURczMzPf399fX1+bm5mzY9AMAAADiSURBVDjLvZXbEsMgCES5/P8/t9FuRVCRmU73JWlzosgSIIZURCjo/ad+EQJJB4Hv8BFt+IDpQoCx1wjOSBFhh2XssxEIYn3ulI/6MNReE07UIWJEv8UEOWDS88LY97kqyTliJKKtuYBbruAyVh5wOHiXmpi5we58Ek028czwyuQdLKPG1Bkb4NnM+VeAnfHqn1k4+GPT6uGQcvu2h2OVuIf/gWUFyy8OWEpdyZSa3aVCqpVoVvzZZ2VTnn2wU8qzVjDDetO90GSy9mVLqtgYSy231MxrY6I2gGqjrTY0L8fxCxfCBbhWrsYYAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC); display:block; height:44px; margin:0 auto -44px; position:relative; top:-22px; width:44px;\"></div></div> <p style=\" margin:8px 0 0 0; padding:0 4px;\"> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BJ_PMRVAcmz/\" style=\" color:#000; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px; text-decoration:none; word-wrap:break-word;\" target=\"_blank\">I&#39;m so sad that this rock has been destroyed. \ud83d\ude2d #ripthepnwrock  and all the great memories made there.</a></p> <p style=\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;\">A photo posted by Arielle\u2600\ufe0f (@barefootarielle) on <time style=\" font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;\" datetime=\"2016-09-05T20:43:42+00:00\">Sep 5, 2016 at 1:43pm PDT</time></p></div></blockquote> <script async defer src=\"//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js\"></script> </figure>  <p>Andrew Reasor, who works at the local brewery on the beach, said locals\u2019 heartbreak at the news turned to outrage when they discovered the destruction was intentional. </p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s been a beautiful part of our area and for out-of-towners to destroy that, something that has been here a while \u2026 it makes me sad,\u201d he said, adding that the locals sponsor beach cleanups regularly and take pride in the region. </p> <p>The police have not identified the alleged vandals. </p> <p>The cliff edges near the rock are considered unstable and there\u2019s been a sign prohibiting people from getting near the popular rock for years, Havel said.

In the previous two eras, by comparison, the gaps were only about three points in 1980-1999 (196.1 vs 199.4) and less than half a point in 1960-1979 (175.3 vs 175.6).</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jul/25/matter-of-stats-simulating-the-likely-afl-finalists-and-their-september-fate\">Matter of stats: simulating the likely AFL finalists and their September fate | Tony Corke</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Some of that larger difference for the most recent era can be attributed to the smaller number of scoring shots that have been generated in finals (48.7 v 50.9), but some of it also comes down to the fact that teams have been generally less accurate in converting those scoring shots into goals in finals than they have been in home and away games (51.9% v 53.6%).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"23b2553a15b5d752cabc608520c5d5a05f3044a5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/23b2553a15b5d752cabc608520c5d5a05f3044a5/0_0_1000_900/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 5 - Accuracy - Home and Away vs Finals\" width=\"1000\" height=\"900\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"339d976fd5d5d3c88e0479ecca342aafabf2a60e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/339d976fd5d5d3c88e0479ecca342aafabf2a60e/0_0_1000_900/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 6 - Average Scoring Shots - Home and Away vs Finals\" width=\"1000\" height=\"900\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>This reduction in accuracy could plausibly be the result of the pressure of finals football affecting teams\u2019 accuracy for even relatively simple set-shots, but it might also stem from an increase in the average difficulty of shots created in finals compared to those created in home and away games. Put simply, you\u2019re probably less likely to have a shot from 25m out straight in front in a preliminary final in September than you are in a round one game in March.</p> <p>Previous analyses have shown that teams with strong offences facing teams with weak defences will tend to generate better quality scoring opportunities and hence will be more accurate. The fact that we\u2019ll see more games with these sorts of mismatched offensive and defensive strengths during the home and away season than we will during the finals might be what ramps up the average difficulty of shots in this latter part of the season, and drags down accuracy.</p> <p>One way of attempting to control for the overall greater variability in opposing teams\u2019 abilities in the home and away season is to look only at home and away season games played between teams that subsequently made the finals.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0f3f3f8ac90215e01dc14b5445c447aed9d4e2ad\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0f3f3f8ac90215e01dc14b5445c447aed9d4e2ad/0_0_1000_900/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 7 - Accuracy - Home and Away vs Finals - Finalist v Finalist Only\" width=\"1000\" height=\"900\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>If we do that we find that there is only a fractional reduction in the size of the gap between accuracy in finals and accuracy in the home and away season in the modern era. In games pitting finalist v finalist in the home and away seasons of 2000 to 2015, the average accuracy was 53.4%, which is only 0.1% lower than the accuracy for all home and away games during that period.</p> <p>So, we\u2019re still left with about a 1.6% difference in the accuracy of finalists when they meet in the finals compared to when they met in the home and away season.</p> <p>Some of that difference might be explained by differences in where or when the games were played \u2013 teams, for example, are much more accurate at Docklands than at the MCG, and slightly more accurate in day games than in afternoon and night games \u2013 but pressure remains a plausible explanation for at least some of this difference. It might also be the case that teams play a more defensive style in finals so that even when the same two teams meet, the average quality of scoring opportunity reduces in finals.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"05369ab1caa3a5cf085cfe181b3da2571fc256f3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/05369ab1caa3a5cf085cfe181b3da2571fc256f3/0_0_1000_900/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 8 - Accuracy - Home and Away vs Finals - Team by Team - Modern Era\" width=\"1000\" height=\"900\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Before we move on let\u2019s briefly review the team-by-team data on accuracy in home and away games compared to accuracy in finals for the modern era, bearing in mind that a number of teams have played relatively few finals during this period, which makes their overall accuracy subject to large sample variation (The numbers appearing above each bar represent the number of games played by that team of that type).</p> <p>We see that every team except Melbourne, North Melbourne and Richmond have exhibited the general pattern of being more accurate in the home and away season than in the finals, though for most teams the differences are quite small \u2013 less than the all-team 1.6% figure.</p> <p>For five teams, however the differences are larger:</p> <ul> <li>Western Bulldogs: 7.0% (47.8% vs 54.8%) \u2013 13 finals </li> <li>West Coast: 4.3% (49.5% vs 53.8%) \u2013 20 finals </li> <li>Geelong: 3.0% (50.9% vs 53.9%) \u2013 27 finals </li> <li>Fremantle: 2.9% (50.4% vs 53.3%) \u2013 15 finals </li> <li>St Kilda: 2.3% (52.2% vs 54.5%) \u2013 17 finals </li> </ul> <p>One notable feature of four of these five teams is that their home and away season accuracy is above the all-team average of 53.6%, and their finals accuracy is below the all-team average of 51.9%. St Kilda is the only exception.</p> <h2>Upsets and form</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"992327751e70300399706d8eec5c6ac4c0b0fafe\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/992327751e70300399706d8eec5c6ac4c0b0fafe/0_0_1000_900/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 9 - Upsets - Home and Away vs Finals\" width=\"1000\" height=\"900\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Since, as we\u2019ve noted a few times now, finals tend to pit teams of more equal ability against one another, it seems plausible that we might see more upsets in finals than in home and away games (where we\u2019ll define an \u201cupset\u201d as a win by the team assessed, pre-game, as being less likely to win according to a fairly simple team rating system).</p> <p>That has, indeed, been the case in every era except the most recent one where favourites have lost about equal proportions of home and away games and of finals (viz 30%).</p> <p>That proportion has remained fairly constant for home and away games across the last few eras, but has fallen dramatically in finals from a figure of over 40% in 1960-1979, to about 35% in 1980-1999 before reaching its current level of 30%.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0e06ffec736b7beecea651773309d5c46bd09e79\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0e06ffec736b7beecea651773309d5c46bd09e79/0_0_1000_900/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 10 - Upsets - Home and Away vs Finals - Finalist v Finalist Only\" width=\"1000\" height=\"900\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>What\u2019s especially interesting about the modern era, however, is how much more likely it is that there will have been upset results in games involving the subsequent finalists when they met earlier in the season.</p> <p>In excess of 40% of these games resulted in the less-highly rated team emerging victorious.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"5c62e44241fcd08292c47b836c9da9d71e0de007\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5c62e44241fcd08292c47b836c9da9d71e0de007/0_0_542_625/434.png\" alt=\"Figure 11 - Using Home and Away Form in QFEF\" width=\"434\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Clearly, the motivation of finals and the style of football that is played in them is enough to materially enhance the prospects of the stronger team, however small might be its superiority.</p> <p>What this implies, of course, is that home and away season results in games played between finalists might not necessarily be a good guide to finals.</p> <p>To explore this issue let\u2019s look just at qualifying and elimination finals and use the following simple rule:</p> <ul> <li>In the final, select the team who won the corresponding encounter in the home and away season </li> <li>If the teams met twice in the home and away season and won one each, use the aggregate score across the two games to make the prediction </li> </ul> <p>Employing that approach for the 64 Finals across the 2000 to 2015 period would have yielded a paltry 57% record, in some seasons getting as many as three of the four results incorrect. Only once, in 2011, would it have resulted in a four from four performance.</p> <h2><strong>Summary</strong></h2> <p>If we look just at the modern era of football from 2000 to 2015, we find that, compared to a typical home and away game, a final will typically:</p> <ul> <li>have a smaller victory margin and be less likely to be a blowout </li> <li>produce fewer scoring shots </li> <li>see lower accuracy in terms of goals as a proportion of scoring shots </li> <li>be less likely to produce an upset (compared to games played between finalists during the home and away season) </li> </ul>",

Earlier this year the then education secretary <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/nicky-morgan\">Nicky Morgan</a> had to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/may/06/government-backs-down-over-plan-to-make-all-schools-academies\">abandon government ambitions</a> to force all schools to become academies \u2013 or have plans to do so \u2013 by 2022, in the face of fierce opposition from Tory rebels.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/apr/25/local-authority-schools-outperform-academies-research-suggests\">Local authority schools outperform academies, research suggests</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Nevertheless the number of schools being issued with academy orders is likely to rise with increased government powers to intervene in not just inadequate schools but those described as <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/hundreds-of-coasting-schools-to-be-transformed\">\u201ccoasting\u201d</a>.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>The LSE/EPI study focused on 205 secondary academies approved for academy sponsorship after the 2010 election and opened by December 2014. These were then compared to a control group of 49 sponsored academies that opened after this period.</p> <p>The report first identifies a jump in results \u2013 equivalent to 1.2 GCSE grades in one subject \u2013 in the year before converting to academy status. In the year of conversion, results rise again equivalent to 1.7 grades in one subject. But after that results start to drop off.</p> <p>Researchers suggest the spike in results before the school has even converted may be down to targeted focus on key stage 4 pupils about to sit their GCSEs by school leaders trying to avoid becoming an academy, or possibly trying to appeal to a successful academy chain. Another explanation might be that after years of poor performance, schools under pressure from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/ofsted\">Ofsted</a> take action to raise standards, perhaps appointing a new headteacher or adopting new teaching policies.</p> <p>\u201cIn conclusion, while we find an initial (and significant) improvement in the year prior to and after becoming a sponsored academy, we cannot attribute that trend to anything that may have been implemented by the academy sponsor,\u201d the study says. \u201cIt may however be a result of the incentives generated by the academisation policy, which the government may well argue is a success in itself. Or, it could be that these schools were improving in any case (perhaps as a result of competition pressures or other interventions), and the fact that they became academies is not relevant. Neither can we say, yet, that the improvements are sustained over a period of longer than three years.\u201d</p> <p>The report says it is is difficult to discern how much of the drop in attainment post-conversion is due to a real decline in improvement and how much is a result of the control group improving its own results in the year before it becomes an academy. \u201cEssentially, we find that the control group starts to behave differently as it prepares for academy conversion,\u201d it says.</p> <p>Earlier this year, analysis by the <a href=\"http://www.local.gov.uk/\">Local Government Association</a> found 86% of local authority schools were rated good or outstanding by Ofsted, compared with 82% of academies and 79% of free schools.</p>",

  "<h2>Priya Elan: \u2018My role models were babymen who dressed as if they hated the system\u2019</h2> <p>Recently, when I went to see the reunited 90s dreampop band Belly, I looked around to see possible future versions of myself. Grey-haired men wearing shapeless jeans, plaid shirts over worn T-shirts and busted-in Converse, clutching their pints of beer as if they were hot water bottles. Was this the future me? Grown-up Asos refuseniks whose mirror image version of themselves had not moved past \u201cit fits, it looks vaguely anonymous \u2013 so it works!\u201d? </p> <p>For most of my teens and 20s I worked as a music journalist \u2013 a job that was so pro-male-arrested-development that you got sent band T-shirts in the post. My role models for style were babymen who dressed as if they hated the system so much that they were ripping convention to shreds one garment at a time (Kurt Cobain, Johnny Rotten). That, or they just wore the type of elaborate performance costume that was hard to navigate through the barriers of the tube (Prince, David Byrne).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"51243bba1475e0b81b71ce3f40e47a5b5f0734e0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/51243bba1475e0b81b71ce3f40e47a5b5f0734e0/0_0_408_640/319.png\" alt=\"Priya Elan, \u2018how to reflect getting older in clothes form?\u2019\" width=\"319\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Priya Elan, \u2018how to reflect getting older in clothes form?\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ali Elan</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Most of pop music is about the elixir of youth, and getting older is associated with some sort of soul death. Peter-Panning it in clothes was the only way to be; so how to reflect getting older in clothes form? It\u2019s hard for men. To paraphrase Simon Amstell, one way to dress in a more mature way is to end up looking like an obscure French poet (dark jumpers, possibly a poloneck, smart trousers, even smarter shoes). </p> <p>My look currently flits between a more mature sensibility and an innate immaturity: smart shirts worn with trousers that look clownishly wide, nautical stripes worn with pleated shorts two sizes too big (my friend calls them \u201cballoon shorts\u201d). It still doesn\u2019t feel very grown-up but it feels different than it was before. And perhaps that\u2019s the point.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"26ab8745953bc6552cd835ae291ca62f328743f7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/26ab8745953bc6552cd835ae291ca62f328743f7/9_67_1141_1715/665.jpg\" alt=\"Leah Harper, \u201cmy taste in clothes became specific, despite the skittish nature of my overall style.\u201d\" width=\"665\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Leah Harper, \u201cmy taste in clothes became specific, despite the skittish nature of my overall style.\u201d</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: HANDOUT</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Leah Harper: \u2018Style-wise, I was all over the place\u2019</h2> <p>If what you wear is a reflection of how you feel, never was this more true than when I was a teenager: style-wise, I was all over the place. I switched from low-rise baggy jeans and Vans to \u201cgypsy skirts\u201d and gladiator belts; from gaudy Tiffany\u2019s necklaces to stripy arm socks, \u00e0 la Avril. </p> <p>So while the early noughties were not obviously formative for me in terms of fashion, they were a time when I developed long-lasting style habits. Spending much of my teenage years in a school uniform meant I learned to customise it to within an inch of its life. The tendency to tweak hems, let out darts, and unpick stitching is one which has stayed. It was also when I first began to scour charity shops, boot sales and eBay \u2013 largely out of determination not to show up to the lower-school disco wearing the same outfit as someone else.</p> <p>Rarely, in fact, did I follow the more fleeting trends of my adolescence: my wardrobe was not full of Von Dutch hats, or sequined butterfly tops. My taste in clothes became specific, despite the skittish nature of my overall style. I often shopped with a stylish friend who insisted there was nothing one \u201ccouldn\u2019t\u201d wear \u2013 a rule I still think of now. </p> <p>As 90s styles roll back around, I find that I now more closely resemble my pre-teen self, in button-up denim skirts, lettuce-edge T-shirts and chokers. If I ever made a conscious effort to cultivate a more mature appearance, the last of it was probably stamped out the summer we all decided to wear jelly shoes. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1355c280dbd62335bf84058a5e90c53f1844e535\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1355c280dbd62335bf84058a5e90c53f1844e535/0_0_604_453/500.jpg\" alt=\"Morwenna Ferrier (right) as a teenager. \u201cI feel like I definitely broke the law at some point.\u201d\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Morwenna Ferrier (right) as a teenager. \u201cI feel like I definitely broke the law at some point.\u201d</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Morwenna Ferrier</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Morwenna Ferrier: \u2018We were \u201cartists\u201d \u2013 we wore army coats, cut-off leggings and big boots\u2019</h2> <p>This was a well-documented phase that took place in my early 20s, when I lived in Italy. The mood then (the early 00s) was anarchic, and I was probably searching for some sort of community, so I decided to dress, well, in what I would now reductively and problematically describe as communist mod-kitsch. If you want to discuss the degeneration of the left then I was a good place to start. </p> <p>This was Turin, 10-odd years ago; the age of Berlusconi. It was his political apotheosis in one way, and everyone was reacting. I didn\u2019t have the vocab but I had big, black boots. The cool kids (we didn\u2019t use the word \u201chipsters\u201d but they were certainly countercultural) had a specific look and a specific lifestyle. We were \u201cartists\u201d. We wore big army coats, black cut-off leggings and big boots. We dyed our hair or shaved it off (I went for the former) and went out to drink major alcohol brands in squats and listen to dubstep. The mood was very protesty \u2013 I feel like I definitely broke the law at some point, possibly occupying something, although often it felt like a phase rather than anything more serious.</p> <p>Looking back, it was more than a gateway look. Before I went there, my style was very haphazard and, well, typically West Country, working on the premise that all we did was sit in fields and pretend to surf and skate. Shortys\u2019 hoodies, baggy skate trousers, Quiksilver vests, ringer T-shirts. I went goth for about eight months and pierced various parts of my face. At university, I brought that with me and by dint of where I went to school (Glastonbury), I also wore a bit of dip-dye and shearling. That\u2019s not to make sweeping generalisations about the West Country but these are tics we have yet to exorcise as a region. </p> <p>The look is actually bang on-trend now. That whole Eastern-bloc look by way of Gosha Rubchinskiy is in the air. It also probably set the tone for how I dress now. Athleisure is the natural successor to this monotone, oversized, over-baggy, pan-gender style. This photo is me in the aftermath, struggling to acclimatise to England. Toned down but, looking at the cords, the sentiment is still there.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"28a22280c5992fb8d446e7ef5e9686c5a04391aa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/28a22280c5992fb8d446e7ef5e9686c5a04391aa/0_55_2082_1829/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Will Dean as a stylish teen\" width=\"1000\" height=\"878\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Will Dean as a stylish teen</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Will Dean</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Will Dean: \u2018This is basically how I dress now at the weekend\u2019 </h2> <p>I don\u2019t think I transitioned, style-wise, from a teenager to an adult until I was about 24 and had (a) had enough money to buy some proper shirts and (b) something of an awareness of how clothes are supposed to fit. </p> <p>A university-era photo submitted for this feature by the writer\u2019s mother but declined by the writer on shame grounds saw me wearing \u2013 quite seriously, as far as I remember \u2013 an oversized shirt and tie belonging to my stepfather. It was for a \u201cdress code: smart, \u00a310 entry\u201d new year\u2019s eve party at the Church Inn in Oldham. It made me look like an eight-year-old wearing a Toys R US \u201cOffice Worker\u201d costume.</p> <p>Somehow, I think I managed to have better personal style before I went to university. As a 16- or 17-year-old, whose shifts as Pizza Hut on Manchester\u2019s Deansgate were beginning to pay off, I developed the idea that nothing was smarter than slim-fitting Ted Baker T-shirts (bought in the sale) and an unlikely obsession with shirts and jumpers made by Italian denim brand Gas. The latter were bought in the \u201cedgy\u201d boutique bit in the bottom of House of Fraser. Neither looked particularly good. A long-sleeved Gas T-shirt still gives me chills, but there was at least a bit of uniformity. </p> <p>The saddest fact about the picture of me here, drinking warm Heineken in terrible specs at what I presume is 2001\u2019s Leeds festival, is that the look: baggy jumper, what look like football shorts and presumably some knackered trainers, is pretty much my current weekend attire. It\u2019s what I wear in the garden, having moved out of London, had a kid and pretty much given up. Except now the beer is cold, and my glasses are better.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ed96064a520b977a070389e8ae8581dc3c0c861b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ed96064a520b977a070389e8ae8581dc3c0c861b/0_0_1450_1027/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nosheen Iqbal (right) as a teenager, \u201cneeding to look original always trumped needing to look pretty.\u201d\" width=\"1000\" height=\"708\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nosheen Iqbal (right) as a teenager, \u201cneeding to look original always trumped needing to look pretty.\u201d</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nosheen Iqbal</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Nosheen Iqbal: \u2018I\u2019ve spent a small fortune buying a wardrobe in the style of what I wore half a lifetime ago\u2019</h2> <p>Two words you don\u2019t want to hear, it turns out, after you have spent a summer casually cultivating your back-to-school September wardrobe: \u201cMidlife crisis?\u201d So brutal, so concise, but then family Whatsapp groups are unforgiving places, and I have spent a small fortune recently buying up \u2013 unwittingly \u2013 a stock of T-shirts and sweatshirts in the style of stuff I probably last wore half a lifetime ago.

Big, complicated life changes being what they are means I\u2019m OK with this simple, pared-down aesthetic. I\u2019m considering it one part off-duty Spike Lee (white sneakers are essential) to two parts adolescent regression. To be fair, considering the wardrobe crimes I committed in my 20s (because needing to look original always trumped needing to look pretty), my teenage years were relatively alright-looking: obscure slogan tees, track tops, Carhartt, Adidas Superstars. Very athleisure, very accommodating of neurotic wardrobe rules I maintain even now: no tits, no shoulder, no thigh, no blue denim jeans since 1997.</p>",

They were all on bikes and in front of them were there guys in the black Golf goading them on. They were out hunting for victims. The men in the car were shouting and yelling, \u2018Kill the faggot\u2019.\u201d<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u201cWhen they started to follow me I tried to outrun them on my bike, but eventually by the time I got to the cricket club they had caught up and I got knocked off my bike by a tree. Some of the boys ran to the car boot and pulled out metal bars, and then I knew I had to fight for my life.\u201d<br></p> <p>He says he managed to fight off a number of them but was eventually overwhelmed by his attackers. \u201cI remember looking down and being covered in blood as they beat me beside the tree. I would have been dead only for a man who was passing by in the park and ran over to help me. At the sight of him these thugs scattered, getting on their bikes and following the car in the direction of Parkgate Street into town.\u201d</p> <p>The Polish immigrant sustained cuts and bruises all over his body, while his face was badly swollen from the beating. \u201cBut for that brave man confronting those thugs I could have been killed. I was spitting up blood all over the ambulance when it was eventually called, trying to call the Garda on my mobile phone but couldn\u2019t get through.\u201d<br></p> <p>Malinowski says the trauma of the attack, both physical and psychological, was compounded by the way the Garda treated his case. \u201cNo one came to interview me in the hospital for 24 hours, at at time when I might have remembered in vivid details things like the registration of the car. It took until 4 August before I finally got to speak to Garda officers and be interviewed about the attack. <br></p> <p>\u201cIn that first meeting one of them said: \u2018Are you really sure it was a hate crime?\u2019 I started to feel that no one was listening to me; that this was an organised homophobic attack and that these thugs were going about targeting gay men.\u201d<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>However, Malinowski\u2019s second discussion with a Garda officer compounded his belief that they were not taking his claims seriously. \u201cI took a phone from a female Garda officer and the first thing she asked me was, \u2018Did you do anything to provoke them?\u2019 I couldn\u2019t believe what she was saying to me. I replied on the phone, \u2018Are you fucking kidding me?\u2019 I was on my way home from work to my home in Blanchardstown going through the park. How is that provoking them?</p> <p>\u201cWhat she was really saying was that I was in the park meeting guys for sex, making it out as if I was at fault even though I was on my bike going home.\u201d</p> <p>His anger over his treatment at the hands of the Garda was heightened by a letter officers sent to his address in Dublin containing details about the attack and contacts for victims organisations.</p> <p>\u201cThe envelope containing some personal details and those contacts wasn\u2019t even sealed or glued. It meant that anyone in the house I share with could have opened it and read it. The whole thing was shabby and casual.\u201d<br></p> <p>A spokesman for the Garda said the force could not comment on the case due to the ombudsman\u2019s complaint. \u201cAs the complaint has been made to the Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na Ombudsman Commission, it would be inappropriate for Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na to comment. All queries should be directed to GSOC.\u201d</p> <p>Malinowski emigrated to Ireland partly because of the rise of rightwing xenophobia and homophobia in his native Poland. He had lived in Galway city, and had only moved to Dublin a month before the attack. </p> <p>\u201cI used to think that Dublin was a gay-friendly city, especially after last year\u2019s referendum to legalise gay marriage. But while you can get married if you are gay and your marriage is equal in Irish law, you are still not protected against hate crime in this city.</p> <p>\u201cThis was an organised attack and if is not taken seriously there will be other victims who are maybe not as strong or able to fight back, and who could end up in a far worse state than I am.\u201d</p> <p><em>Marcin\u2019s surname has been changed in this article to protect his identity.</em></p>",

Her accusations caused a brief stir until Montgomery County\u2019s top prosecutor declined to bring charges. Cosby quietly settled Constand\u2019s claims in civil court in 2006.</p> <p>Over the years, several more women came forward to make similar accusations against Cosby \u2013 that he drugged their drinks and touched or penetrated them when they were immobilized or unconscious. But their claims went little noticed until late November 2014, when comedian Hannibal Buress made a crack about the multiple rape accusations facing Cosby on a standup tour. As footage of his jokes went viral, news outlets investigated the accusations with a new vigor, and dozens more women went public with claims of Cosby\u2019s assaults. </p> <p>Taken together, their claims portray Cosby as assaulting women for almost the entirety of his time in the public eye. Constand\u2019s was one of just a handful of cases still eligible for prosecution under the statute of limitations. </p> <p>In 2015, the Associated Press published what seemed to many like a strong justification for bringing Cosby to trial: <a href=\"http://www.bigstory.ap.org/article/b3d729e27f844841a2045053cb054c22/cosby-faces-preliminary-hearing-week-sex-charge\">excerpts of Cosby\u2019s deposition</a> in Constand\u2019s civil case, in which he admitted to obtaining quaaludes to give to women from whom he wanted sex. He also acknowledged giving Constand three unspecified pills before their sexual encounter.</p> <p>But the criminal case now going forward in Montgomery County was almost derailed multiple times. Castor, the prosecutor who declined to press charges, made <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/31/bill-cosby-charges-dozens-women-testify-court\">numerous public statements</a> questioning Constand\u2019s consistency. A new prosecutor, Kevin Steele, filed charges just days before the statute of limitations ran out. </p> <p>In court, the Cosby legal team mounted a furious resistance in the form of legal stalling tactics. Cosby\u2019s attorneys variously argued that Castor had cut a deal of immunity with Cosby that was never documented; that the court could not authorize a trial <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/24/bill-cosby-trial-sexual-assault-charges-pennsylvania-temple\">unless Constand testified</a> at a pre-trial hearing; and that the trial <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/07/bill-cosby-trial-sexual-assault-charges-pennsylvania\">could not go forward</a> until a state supreme court decision on a procedural matter was resolved. </p> <p>For a short time during 2015, Constand also numbered among the Cosby accusers who the comedian has sued for defamation. Cosby said her cooperation with police in 2015 counted as a violation of the terms of their 2006 settlement. Cosby recently dropped that suit, which also named Constand\u2019s lawyers and her mother.</p>",
  "<p>The arrival of a new Terrence Malick film is always something of an event, even if the great man\u2019s lustre is beginning to wear off under the weight of his gigantic reputation: even the most diehard Malick obsessives would surely admit that the fey, whispery To the Wonder and the self-indulgent Knight of Cups were not really up to scratch. Compared to how he used to, Malick works at a virtual sprint these days, and now his long-awaited documentary Voyage of Time has been unveiled at the Venice film festival.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jun/30/voyage-of-time-trailer-terrence-malick-brad-pitt-cate-blanchett\">Trailer for Malick film about creation of universe grafts branches from Tree of Life</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Intriguingly, for such a control-freak auteur, Voyage of Time is being issued in two different versions, at two different running times: the one Venice is presenting is a 90-minute edit, subtitled Life\u2019s Journey, with a voiceover provided by Cate Blanchett. Also floating around is one half its length, intended for the giant-format Imax cinemas, with Blanchett replaced by Brad Pitt. (According to Malick\u2019s own notes, Pitt\u2019s voiceover is \u201cmore awestruck and explanatory\u201d; we\u2019ll just have to wait and see exactly what that means.)</p> <p>Moreover, slightly more advance information has been available about Voyage of Time than is usual for project from the famously secretive director; partly, at least, because Malick got himself ensnared in some unwelcome litigation <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/jul/22/terrence-malick-sued-forgetting-to-make-film\">after an unhappy backer claimed he \u201cforgot\u201d about it</a>. (The case has now been settled.) Malick\u2019s stated ambition is to describe the \u201cscientific chronology of Earth\u201d \u2013 to, in effect, chronicle the development of our universe and planet at macro and micro levels \u2013 and, given that the contents of his own mind have increasingly preoccupied Malick\u2019s creative imagination, it is I suppose a logical development for him to produce a film with no actors, and any human input in front of the camera kept to an absolute minimum.</p> <p>The first point to make is that, for this feature-length version at any rate, anyone expecting a brisk, informative science lesson \u2013 along the lines, say, of that rather handy little film that explained how they cloned dinosaurs in Jurassic Park \u2013 will be disappointed. Malick has provided a dazzling flow of quite astonishing images, but provided little in the way of context; Blanchett\u2019s voiceover, hardly there in any case, is very much on the incantatory, putatively poetic lines for which the director clearly has a weakness. (In all honesty, if it was stripped out entirely, I doubt it would make a great deal of difference to the film\u2019s impact.)</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/feb/26/terrence-malick-settlement-voyage-of-time\">Terrence Malick reaches settlement over unfinished film Voyage of Time</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Everything comes in a heady rush; so much so it\u2019s difficult to process what exactly we are seeing. Vast galactic spaces, filled with churning cosmic matter, give way to pristine earthbound landscapes; great care is taken to focus on the flow and change and transformation of what is being filmed. Malick then swoops even further in, down to microscopic and even subatomic levels: microbes, cells, and smaller particles all float by in their eye-popping glory. What\u2019s particularly remarkable is that there is little difference in the brilliant image quality between the intense, high-definition footage of natural phenomena, and the superbly rendered CGI that has been employed for the sections for which the film-makers must rely on their own imaginations: star collapses, expanding galaxies, and the like.</p> <p>Without any contextual information, it\u2019s down to the audience to pick up on Malick\u2019s cues as to the sense of the development of geological time: some are more obvious than others, such as the arrival of a giant asteroid shortly after we get a look at a friendly-looking CGI dinosaur (who, for obvious reasons, never reappears). Humans aren\u2019t shut out entirely; in the film\u2019s final third we are invited to watch a group of&#xa0;(suspiciously gym-hardened) early humans, who pass through stages of hunting, clothes-wearing and family life, as well as the apparent development of ritual and spirituality. Malick also intersperses his glorious natural imagery throughout with scrappy bits of lo-fi video footage of contemporary human activity across the globe \u2013 largely, but not entirely, in cramped urban spaces. It\u2019s quite a contrast.</p> <p>In this version, then, Voyage of Time is perhaps best appreciated as an abstract, with its sheer profusion of natural beauty and consequent synchronicities of image. It\u2019s not entirely without precedent \u2013 the&#xa0;Koyaanisqatsi films by Godfrey Reggio and Ron Fricke had something of a similar aesthetic ambition, though with very different ends in mind, and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fKBhvDjuy0\">the Eames\u2019 famous short, Powers of Ten</a>, contains a little of the same dizzying sense of scale, though in exquisite miniature. Voyage of Time, in the end, is a perhaps an aesthetic experience rather than an particularly informative one, prizing images over data; but what images they are.</p> <p><br></p>",

  "<p>On 27 August, six Danish MPs boarded an aeroplane in Copenhagen.

The nationalist Danish People\u2019s party has for many years argued in favour of a similar model in Denmark. They suggest the deportation of refugees to a Danish military base in Greenland. </p> <p>I, on the other hand, had sharply criticised the Australian camps in Danish and international media. The governing party in Denmark has been lying low, but the minister for integration, who was originally going on the trip, has indicated that inspiration could be sought in Australia.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/03/nauru-fiasco-serves-to-confirm-danish-groups-suspicions-of-australian-tactics\">Nauru fiasco serves to confirm Danish group's suspicions of Australian tactics</a> </p> </aside>  <p>On 29 August \u2013 just over 24 hours after arriving in Australia \u2013 we received a disheartening piece of information. Three MPs were denied access by the government of Nauru, which didn\u2019t even try to hide the reason. Government representatives openly said to the chairman of the delegation and to the Danish embassy that critics were not welcome.</p> <p>Nauru is an extremely poor country facing serious democratic challenges. Law professor and president of the Australian Human Rights Commission, Gillian Triggs, has been denied a visa. Very few journalists have been granted access to the camps.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I repeatedly tried to get an answer to the question: who has the legal responsibility for the refugees on Nauru?</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It is, however, quite disturbing that Australia operates refugee camps on these conditions. During our visit to Canberra we met UNHCR representative Thomas Albrecht. He told us that after 30 years of working with refugees he expected that nothing could shock him. But on Nauru he saw greater hopelessness than anywhere else. He told us of his shocking encounter with a girl of about eight years old \u2013 the same age as his grandchild. He had asked her name. \u201cEZBO7,\u201d she replied. \u201cNo, what is your <em>name,\u201d</em> he insisted. \u201cEZBO7.\u201d He told us about children that had stopped playing and about self-harm and attempted suicide even among pre-teenagers.</p> <p>During our Australian visit, I repeatedly tried to get an answer to the question: who has the legal responsibility for the refugees on Nauru, in light of the Nauru files? I have asked high-ranking representatives of the Australian Department of Immigration and Border Protection and the assistant minister, Alex Hawke. After asking for a whole week I still haven\u2019t got a clear answer. In the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/series/nauru-files\">Nauru files</a>, we can read about a great number of incidents where children were abused. The Danish delegation hasn\u2019t been able to get an answer to the question whether even one single incident has been investigated by police or led to a verdict in court.</p> <p>The vast majority of the asylum seekers who have been sent to Nauru and Manus Island have been recognised as refugees according to the UN refugee convention. They are supposed to be under protection and they will be at risk if they are sent home. But where can they go? After 10 years, their residence permit on Nauru will expire. What\u2019s next?

Triggs gave me the answer. As opposed to Europe, where almost all countries are part of the European Convention on Human Rights (and its court), there is, in Australia, no authority with legal powers to stop human rights violations. UN committees may express criticism, but they can\u2019t enforce the rules.</p> <p>In Europe, we also have an ongoing debate on how to handle people who flee their countries. And rightwing politicians, not only in Denmark, praise the Australian model. If I were to even go near considering the concept of regional processing centres for asylum seekers, I would need good answers to these questions: how will you ensure that conditions in these centres live up to human rights and to the UN refugee convention? And how do you ensure a realistic perspective for resettlement?</p> <p>The Australian camps are certainly no source of inspiration. On the contrary. The secrecy in itself and the undefinable legal responsibility call for a massive international condemnation.</p> <p><em>Johanne Schmidt-Nielsen is a member of the Danish parliament for the Red-Green Alliance (Enhedslisten).</em></p>",

First and foremost let me say this: this encounter is exactly why we love this game and the fact that on paper, it was not even meant to happen. Admit it, this had Nadal/Raonic written all over it, but these two were ready to crash the party.</p> <p>The 30-year-old Monfils arrives tonight without dropping a set, including his recent victory against Marcos Baghdatis (6-3, 6-2, 6-3) in the previous round. The Parisian is one of the most exciting players because quite simply he\u2019s everything in one package: audaciously talented, improvisational and extremely frustrating to watch. His acrobatic style can fill a highlight reel but his inability to stay consistent has impeded him from reaching a higher level. He has six titles to his name and only reached a Grand Slam semi-final once: the French Open in 2008. At the US Open, he has reached the quarters twice, without any success. But this summer, with the help of his new coach, Swede Mikael Tillstrom, he is enjoying a great season, making it to the quarterfinals in the Australian Open and winning the Citi Open.</p> <p>In his way, stands the new kid on the block, 22-year-old Pouille, who after beating Nadal in a thrilling four-hour, five-set affair, is ready to make some more noise at Flushing Meadows. After making it to the last eight in Wimbledon earlier this summer, Pouille climbed to 21st in the world. The Frenchman has all the attributes of a star, only time will tell if he lives up to expectation.</p> <p>The last and only time both players have faced each other was last year at the Australian Open in the first round when Monfils came back from two sets down to win 6-7 3-6 6-4 6-1 6-4. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRYynVYImYE\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/YRYynVYImYE?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Stay tuned, this is going to be a good one. <br></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57cecea3e4b0f2c90ce77333\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-06T14:12:26.630Z\">3.12pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Luis will be here shortly but in the meantime here\u2019s how Andy Murray got on last night:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Of the eight players left in the men\u2019s draw of the 2016 US Open, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/andymurray\">Andy Murray</a> has hit the highest pitch of excellence \u2013 and the fastest serve of his life \u2013 in allowing Grigor Dimitrov only five games in two hours of exhilarating tennis.</p> <p>The Scot\u2019s 141 mile-an-hour rocket on the eighth evening of the tournament was one of nine aces he put past the bewildered Bulgarian, who barely got into the match at any point. On Wednesday Murray plays the sixth seed and former finalist Kei Nishikori, who earlier put out the veteran Ivo Karlovic in three tough sets.</p> <p>Murray said courtside: \u201cI served 145 in San Jose once, but the next day they recalibrated the gun because it was completely wrong. I think I was lucky. I\u2019ve never hit over 140 before. I don\u2019t expect to do it again.\u201d</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div>",

Mastroianni\u2019s harsher sentence means he can apply to be transferred to Australia in six years\u2019 time. However, because Whitmore pleaded guilty last year, his sentence is half as long as Matroianni\u2019s.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve done every thing we can,\u201d said Stevens. \u201cAt the end of the day, Lance did plead guilty. We were not fighting the fact that he was guilty.\u201d</p> <p>Working for a petroleum company, Whitmore was caught in August 2014 with 200 ecstasy pills in the beach town Pattaya, where his father lives. Mastroianni was caught with 61 pills, Stevens said.</p> <p>Nathan Feeney, a legal consultant for Mastroianni, said his client would have received a much lighter sentence if he had pleaded guilty, similar to Whitmore, but his previous lawyers advised him not to.</p> <p>The court ruled on Tuesday that the duo would not have to pay 3.3m baht (\u00a371,000) in fines, Feeney said.</p> <p>Klong Prem, the high-security prison where the pair are living, is notorious for its poor conditions.<strong> </strong>Small cells have a hole in the floor for human waste, and inmates <a href=\"https://widerimage.reuters.com/story/inside-thailands-klong-prem-prison\">sleep on the floor</a>.

Only 18% of patients with advanced pancreatic cancer are alive after one year and 4% after five years, so new treatments for the disease are badly needed.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/09/cancer-zip/giv-31075Di2c1jqk31Da/\" data-alt=\"How the drug works\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/09/cancer-zip/giv-31075Di2c1jqk31Da/\">How the drug works</a> </figure>  <p>\u201cTo me it\u2019s really exciting,\u201d said Dalgleish. \u201cThis is the first time we have got an immunotherapy that is a really good candidate to help control pancreatic cancer, which is one of the biggest killing diseases. Its incidence nearly matches its mortality. It is absolutely staggering.\u201d<br></p> <p>Most importantly, the drug worked on the immune system without any toxic effects. \u201cThat\u2019s never been seen before,\u201d he said. \u201cYou always add toxicity and misery in my experience with each additional thing you put in.\u201d</p> <p>Adding IMM-101 to the standard chemotherapy drug patients receive, gemcitabine, did not benefit those patients whose pancreatic cancer had spread locally, but it improved the lifespan of those whose cancer was metastatic \u2013 it had progressed into other parts of the body \u2013 and would be expected to die quickly. </p> <p>The results are published in the British Journal of Cancer. Most of the patients \u2013 85% \u2013 had metastatic disease. Those who were just given the standard chemotherapy drug survived for a median of 4.4 months, but those who had the IMM-101 immunotherapy drug as well survived for seven months. But some lived for more than a year and one died after nearly three years.</p> <p>Immunotherapy drugs have produced exciting results in skin and lung cancer, but not in pancreatic tumours, which are \u201cvery deep and very shielded\u201d from their effects, said Dalgleish. </p> <p>IMM-101 re-awakens the immune system that the cancer has effectively switched off. Pancreatic tumours have an outer shell of cells which act like a shield. IMM-101 activates the immune system, enabling it to recognise and target the tumour so that the chemotherapy drug can work.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s rather like depth-charging the immune system which has been sent to sleep,\u201d said Dalgleish. It is very different in its mode of operation from the checkpoint inhibitors, which turn on the immune system in a way that causes it to kill cancer cells but often attack healthy tissue too. It is also given by a simple injection and is far cheaper than the checkpoint inhibitors. </p> <p>Dalgleish says the immunotherapy drug could have uses in a wide variety of cancers. He carried out an earlier study using IMM-101, which contains a killed bacterium, on skin cancer patients. \u201cIn my melanoma patients in particular, patients have shown greatly increased survival rates and enjoy a much better quality of life. In some patients I\u2019ve actually seen the cancer disappearing altogether,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The overall survival benefit, however \u2013 adding in all of the 110 patients \u2013 was not significant. Those who had IMM-101 survived a median of 6.7 months compared with 5.6 months for those just on chemotherapy.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>That was because those patients in the pancreatic cancer trial who had locally advanced disease \u2013 18 out of the total of 110 \u2013 appeared to do better without the immunotherapy drug. Survival was a median of 6.7 months with IMM-101 and 9.2 months without it. Those numbers are small, which makes it hard to conclude anything from them, but Dalgleish says metastatic cancer is in effect a different disease. A new and bigger trial is being planned which will include only patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer.</p> <p>The study was supported by the Institute for Cancer Vaccines and Immunotherapy from the earliest stages. Harry Cotterell, chair of trustees, said: \u201cThese are exciting results and support our hope that immunotherapy will in future become a generally accepted treatment for a wide range of cancers, improving both survival rates and quality of life.\u201d</p> <p>Other cancer experts welcomed the development of an immunotherapy drug without side-effects, but pointed to the absence of a definitive overall survival benefit for all patients.</p> <p>Dr Justine Alford, Cancer Research UK\u2019s senior science information officer, said: \u201cWhile the results of this early trial didn\u2019t show whether combining the immunotherapy drug with standard chemotherapy actually improved survival, they showed the combination treatment was safe and might help some patients. Further research with more patients is needed to develop therapies that can improve survival. Pancreatic cancer is difficult to treat and survival still remains low, which is why new treatments are urgently needed.\u201d</p> <p>Kevin Harrington, professor of biological cancer therapies at the Institute of Cancer Research in London, and a consultant at the Royal Marsden, said: \u201cThis looks like a very interesting approach. It is different. It appears to be extremely well-tolerated and it has led to something that looks interesting in terms of survival but it hasn\u2019t quite got there.\u201d </p>",

Later, once Richardson\u2019s 45-over hospital hiatus was over, the jack-of-all Collingwood picked up some further bowling slack, after the bursts of Graham Onions and Chris Rushworth with the second new ball.</p> <p>That spell reaped the dismissal of the young Australian Jake Lehmann \u2013 who reached 58 without getting to 60 for the fifth time in six innings for the club \u2013 well taken low in the gully by Ryan Pringle, but nothing else, and left Yorkshire on course for maximum batting points. Andrew Gale\u2019s team began this round of matches four points behind the leaders, Middlesex, in their quest to win a third consecutive title. With its destiny looking as if it will go down to the final round showdown between the two at Lord\u2019s, every point counts.</p> <p>Three of their batsmen were left to rue soft dismissals. Gale followed Lyth\u2019s waft by being bowled round his legs and then came Lees\u2019s demise. Having got to 84, and the magic 1,000 mark for the first time in his career, via a five \u2013 Jack Burnham\u2019s shy at the non-striker\u2019s end ricocheting to the boundary \u2013 Lees evened things up when he belted a full bunger from the off-spinner Pringle (six wickets at 73 apiece before this game) straight back at the bowler.</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want to get out playing a half-hearted shot,\u201d he said.

  "<p>So now we know for sure, thanks to the permanent secretary at the Department for Education, who really ought to order in some document folders pronto.

Last October the then education secretary Nicky Morgan gave the go-ahead for a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2015/oct/15/conservatives-green-light-first-selective-state-school-50-years\" title=\"\">new grammar \u201cannexe\u201d in Kent a full 10 miles from the main school</a>. May\u2019s strategy, with its further pledge to open new grammars, and possibly seeking to overturn the 1998 law banning them in order to do so, is even more radical, and will face correspondingly greater resistance. \u201cI simply can\u2019t see any way of persuading the Lords to vote for selection on any other basis,\u201d the note concludes.</p> <p>Condemnation came swiftly from Labour, the Liberal Democrats and the National Union of Teachers; but opposition to an expansion of grammar schools has united leading figures in education and on the political left and right, including the influential thinktanks Policy Exchange and Bright Blue, and the outgoing Ofsted chief, Michael Wilshaw.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>A child\u2019s development score at just 22 months can serve as an accurate predictor of educational attainment at 26 years</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Yet a vital dimension is missing from the debate already raging within and beyond Westminster. The government is proposing a fresh crop of grammar schools as a way of boosting so-called social mobility, but May and her advisers seem to have forgotten that the government already has a <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/61964/opening-doors-breaking-barriers.pdf\" title=\"\">social mobility strategy, produced in 2011</a>, and it doesn\u2019t make a single mention of grammar schools. In fact, though it identifies four \u201ccritical points for social mobility\u201d, age 11 is not one of them.</p> <p>The evidence on grammars is by now crystal clear. The educational advantage received by those selected for these schools is more than outweighed by the drag effect of the remaining secondary modern pupils, who perform disproportionately badly. Only 3% of grammar school pupils receive free school meals, and even these will gain only a marginal uplift in GCSE grades. As the Daily Telegraph\u2019s Jeremy Warner says, grammars offer \u201csegregated education for the middle class\u201d. They are elitist institutions that entrench, rather than disrupt or disperse, privilege.</p> <p>But the evidence is equally clear on what does improve educational outcomes: high-quality support in the early years. According to Michael Pavey, director of <a href=\"https://laboursurestart.com/\" title=\"\">Labour Friends of Sure Start</a>, \u201cNeuroscience shows that a child\u2019s brain is approximately 25% formed at birth, and that by the age of three it is 80% formed. It is during this crucial time that gaps open up between children from different backgrounds.\u201d</p> <p>A child\u2019s development score at just 22 months can serve as an accurate predictor of educational attainment at 26 years. Forget the 11-plus: children from poorer homes are already playing catch-up by the time they start nursery.</p> <p>The government should understand this very well. Independent reports commissioned by the coalition government from Frank Field (2010), Dame Clare Tickell (2011) and Graham Allen (2011) all emphasised the overwhelming importance of the early years. And as the government\u2019s own social mobility strategy declared: \u201cChildren\u2019s life chances are most heavily influenced by their development in the first five years of life. By the time children start school there are already wide variations in ability between children from different backgrounds.\u201d So how does testing 10- and 11-year-olds help?</p> <p>There\u2019s been talk of introducing a small number of targeted grammar schools. But if the government is looking to test interventions, it should concentrate on the early years, targeting maternal health, school readiness, home environment and parenting skills.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/feb/23/childcare-free-nursery-education\">Early years focus is right but it needs proper investment | Observer editorial</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Maybe this sounds familiar: yes, Sure Start children\u2019s centres, those much-valued community-based institutions <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/jan/28/sure-start-centres-closed-labour\" title=\"\">whose budgets have been halved during Theresa May\u2019s time in government</a>, forcing over 800 of them to close.</p> <p>An independent evaluation of Sure Start in 2012 noted that \u201cchildren\u2019s centres have been found to be immensely popular with parents, and have been successful in reaching the parents who are likely to be the most disadvantaged.

Grammar schools belong to the postwar world, when most young people tended to leave school at 15 and only 4% attended university. Not only do most people in education know that, so now does a substantial chunk of the Tory party.</p> <p>Equally, although Labour\u2019s pledges \u2013 to support and bolster a comprehensive system and restore the education maintenance allowance and student grants \u2013 are welcome, they still address only the symptom rather than the cause.

  "<p>Protesters have gathered outside the Jamaican high commission in south-west London to demonstrate against Jamaica\u2019s cooperation with a deportation flight due to take off on Wednesday morning.</p> <p>Mothers, fathers and grandparents are among those due to be forcibly removed from the UK to Jamaica despite many of them having spent their entire adult lives in Britain. In some cases they are still fighting their immigration cases, activists said. </p> <p>Critics have raised questions about the tactics used by Home Office immigration enforcement, which has been accused of \u201cstrategically\u201d detaining individuals to fill the flight, without consideration of their circumstances. </p> <p>The Unity Centre, a Glasgow-based migration support collective, said <a href=\"http://unitycentreglasgow.org/home-office-restarts-racist-jamaica-charter-flights/\">in a statement</a> that it has spoken to more than 50 of the passengers booked on the flight, all of who came to the UK as children but have failed to regularise their immigration status. </p> <p>It says all but one of them have British children, one has been married to a British national for 12 years, and two are full-time carers to their partners. Many have never been convicted of a criminal offence. </p> <p>Hilary Brown, managing director of the law firm Virgo Consultancy Services, based in south London, said she had managed to get clients taken off the flight by filing judicial reviews of the actions taken by the Home Office. </p> <p>One of those clients is a woman in her 60s who was married to a British man but whose application for indefinite leave to remain was held up by so much bureaucracy that her husband died before it was completed, Brown said. </p> <p>After her husband\u2019s death, she was told she no longer had a case to stay, despite having children and grandchildren in the UK. She was seized on Friday at her daughter\u2019s house and taken into immigration detention. </p> <p>Another Jamaican on the flight is Twane Morgan, 33, from Birmingham, a veteran of the British army who suffers from post-traumatic stress and bipolar disorder after two tours of Afghanistan. </p> <p>His sister, Tenisha Morgan, said he was detained a fortnight ago after he went to sign on at an immigration centre. He was served with a deportation order three years ago after a conviction for GBH, she said. </p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s got kids here, he\u2019s got a young baby here [of] four months old,\u201d Tenisha Morgan said. \u201cThey are not taking those into consideration. He\u2019s got family here, he\u2019s got people to support him. When he goes to Jamaica he\u2019s going to be a madman on the street. I don\u2019t want to hear that my brother is dead. He\u2019s got no one in Jamaica, totally no one.\u201d</p> <p>She said her brother\u2019s mental health problems began after his two tours of Afghanistan, during which he saw friends killed. She believed that the act that led to his conviction was related his mental ill-health. He is reliant on strong injections of sedatives to keep his mental health problems in check, medicines that would not be available to him in Jamaica, she said.</p> <p>Activists believe this is the first immigration removal flight to Jamaica since November 2014. Brown said it seemed that immigration enforcement was acting quickly in an effort to prevent those being removed from making legal challenges.</p> <p>\u201cWhat you can do is go to the high court and challenge the fact that you are not being given an in-country appeal and that in itself is a breach of your human rights,\u201d she said. </p> <p>\u201cBut what they are doing is they are trying to snatch these people away very quickly before the three months [time limit for lodging a judicial review] is up so the lawyers may be trying to gather all of the evidence to make sure the Home Office knows everything \u2026 before we\u2019ve gathered that and before the three months is up they will try to put them on the plane.\u201d</p> <p>Lee Jasper, the veteran black-rights activist and former equalities adviser to the mayor of London, wrote a plea to the Jamaican government on the Facebook page for the protest. \u201cThe people on that flight have lived in Britain for years. Some have committed criminal offences, most have not. We urge you not to accept this charter flight that constitutes a grave infringement of the human rights of [Jamaicans] living in the UK,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The Home Office declined to comment on Tuesday evening.</p>",

  "<p>The Labour leadership contest is all but done and dusted. Owen Smith must know it. Jeremy Corbyn certainly knows it. Which is why he is now more than happy to incorporate some of his hobbies into his touring schedule. Call it some light recreational campaigning. Today music. Tomorrow horticulture.</p> <p>Under normal circumstances the hashtag UB4Corbyn might be ill-advised. A sign that the Labour leader ought to be picking up his unemployment benefit. But when you\u2019re about to be endorsed by UB40, a band that had three No 1 hits more than 30 years ago, anything can be overlooked. </p> <p>Even the fact that the original band fell out with each other so badly that there are now two UB40s touring Britain \u2013 both claiming to be the Continuity UB40 \u2013 and the other one has refused to endorse you. No parallels with the Labour party there.</p> <p>Red, Red Wine and I Got You Babe \u2013 UB40\u2019s two best-known hits \u2013 played on a loop as an invited audience of young Labour activists, far too young to know who UB40 were, and bewildered hacks waited in a basement of the Royal Society of Arts in central London for the headline act to appear. And waited. And waited. </p> <p>UB40 featuring Jeremy Corbyn were due on stage at 1pm but by 1.20pm there was still no sign of them.

There\u2019s another trade deal that\u2019s already signed | Nick Dearden</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But the lobbyists who demanded this charter for corporate rights never give up. TTIP has been booed off the stage but another treaty, whose probable impacts are almost identical, is waiting in the wings. And this one is more advanced, wanting only final approval. If this happens before Britain leaves the EU, we are likely to be <a href=\"http://www.globaljustice.org.uk/news/2016/jul/4/eu-accused-trying-push-through-toxic-trade-deal-ahead-brexit\" title=\"\">stuck with it for 20 years</a>.</p> <p>The Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (Ceta) is ostensibly a deal between the EU and Canada. You might ask what harm Canada could do us. But it allows any corporation that operates there, wherever its headquarters might be, to sue governments before an international tribunal. It threatens to tear down laws protecting us from exploitation and prevent parliaments on both sides of the Atlantic from legislating.</p> <p>To say that there is no mandate for such agreements is an understatement: they have received an unequivocal counter-mandate. The consultation the EU grudgingly launched on TTIP\u2019s proposal to grant new legal rights to corporations received 150,000 responses, <a href=\"http://www.ohchr.org/en/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=20174\" title=\"\">97% of which were hostile</a>. But while choice is permitted when you shop for butter, on the big decisions there is no alternative.</p> <p>It\u2019s not clear whether national parliaments will be allowed to veto this treaty. The European trade commissioner has argued that <a href=\"http://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/press/index.cfm?id=1524\" title=\"\">there is no need</a>: it can be put before the European parliament alone. But even if national parliaments are allowed to debate it, they will be permitted only to take it or leave it. The contents are deemed to have been settled already.</p> <p>Only once the negotiations between European and Canadian officials had been completed, and the text of the agreement leaked, <a href=\"http://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/docs/2014/september/tradoc_152806.pdf\" title=\"\">did the European commission publish it</a>. It is 1,600 pages long. It has neither a contents list nor explanatory text.

Where were the debates, the drive to seek genuine public engagement, let alone consent?

Like TTIP, it uses a broad definition of both investment and expropriation to allow corporations to sue governments when they believe their \u201cfuture anticipated profits\u201d might be threatened by new laws.</p> <p>Like TTIP, it restricts the ways in which governments may protect their people. It appears to prohibit, for example, rules that would prevent banks from becoming too big to fail. It seems to threaten our planning laws and other commonsense protections.</p> <p>Anything not specifically exempted from the agreement is considered covered. In other words, if governments do not spot a potential hazard before the hazard emerges, they are stuck with it. The EU appears to have relinquished its ability, for example, to insist that investment and retail banking be separated.</p> <p>Ceta claims to be a trade treaty, but many of its provisions have little to do with trade.

Of those sent home on Tuesday, about 20 pupils returned to classes wearing the correct uniform.</p> <p>\u201cThis is part of raising expectations and standards so that every child has a fantastic education,\u201d said Tate, who joins the school from Trinity Free School in Sevenoaks. \u201cA small minority of parents were not happy but we have had emails and phone calls from other parents to express their support.\u201d<br></p> <p>In his welcome message on the school\u2019s website, Tate says that part of the school vision is \u201cexcellent uniform, a commitment to perfect uniform\u201d. He continues: \u201cAnd a \u2018no excuses\u2019 culture where excellence is the norm.\u201d</p> <p>Police were called by a member of the public shortly after 11am after reports of a disturbance outside the school in George V Avenue, where a number of parents and pupils had gathered. There were reports of \u201ctension\u201d but no charges were brought.</p> <p>Allison Hopper\u2019s daughter, who is in year 9, was turned away for not wearing a blazer or the correct shoes. \u201cI rang the school, who were extremely rude, and they said she\u2019s not allowed in because of unacceptable uniform, which I might add cost me a small fortune. The secretary agreed she was allowed to go home to get her blazer, but she\u2019s not allowed in due to her shoes.\u201d</p> <p>Sian Williams added: \u201cThere were 11-year-old children on their first day at school in tears because they were being sent home. There was one girl who was sent home because she had a gold buckle on her black shoes.\u201d</p> <p>Another parent, who did not wish to be named, said: \u201cI think this has been handled badly especially the head teacher being so strict with the children. The school has a duty of care - anything could have happened to those children.\u201d</p> <p>Hartsdown, which is rated \u201cgood\u201d by Ofsted and is sponsored by the Coastal Academies Trust, is a challenging school with a large number of pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds, including unaccompanied asylum seekers and eastern European children with English as an additional language.</p> <p>The executive head of the Coastal Academies Trust, Paul Luxmoore, said: \u201cHartsdown has previously been viewed in the community as a scruffy school.

On Tuesday, the Met announced a pause to the plans while it consulted further.</p> <p>It said it had taken the decision in February to pilot the spit hoods, and claimed to have held consultations.</p> <p>But in a statement the Met said: \u201cHowever, with a new administration coming into City Hall since then, the MPS [Metropolitan police service] has listened to concerns and will consult further before starting any pilot.\u201d</p> <p>The mesh hoods have proved controversial, and there have been claims that they <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2016/aug/29/uk-police-forces-under-pressure-to-stop-using-spit-hoods\">breach suspects\u2019 rights</a> and could even be dangerous.<br></p> <p>Spitting at officers exposes them to risks of contracting hepatitis and such \u201cattacks\u201d by suspects have led to police taking powerful antiviral drugs as a precaution.</p> <p>The Met in its statement laid out its view of the background to the pilot, which could have gone on to clear the way for officers on the street to be issued with spit hoods.<br></p> <p>The Met said: \u201cA pilot within the controlled environment of custody suites had been arranged for October. This was agreed by the MPS policy forum in February, which is made up of officers and staff from across the organisation.</p> <p>\u201cA consultation process regarding their use has taken place and involved community advisers from Newham\u2019s independent advisory group, in addition to local magistrates and judicial staff.\u201d</p> <p>A spokesperson for the London mayor\u2019s office for policing and crime said: \u201cAny attack on officers carrying out their duties is completely unacceptable, and the use of protective equipment is sometimes necessary.

We will be discussing the details with the Met and will consult closely with them, and see what further consultation may be appropriate, ahead of any pilot.\u201d</p> <p> The Met had previously opposed the use of the restraint devices, and some police chiefs have privately expressed concerns that they are reminiscent of hoods used at Guant\u00e1namo Bay.</p> <p>The Met\u2019s plan to introduce them was condemned by the human rights group Amnesty International, the civil rights group Liberty and the campaign group Inquest, which helps those who claim to have suffered at police hands.</p> <p>In response to the Met police\u2019s suspension of the planned pilot, Amnesty International UK\u2019s arms programme director, Oliver Sprague, said: \u201cWe\u2019re relieved that the Met police has decided to put the brakes on what was a very controversial decision.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s urgently needed now is detailed national guidance on how these restraints can be used, the exact models which are used by all forces and assurances that this barbaric equipment will only be used when absolutely necessary.\u201d</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/police\">Police</a> Federation, which represents rank-and-file officers, has called for the use of the hoods to protect police. The Met says the deployment of the hoods will be classed as a use of force by an officer.</p> <p>Before the Met announced that it was not going ahead with the pilot, Martha Spurrier, the director of Liberty, said: \u201cA spit hood is a primitive, cruel and degrading tool that inspires fear and anguish. We have seen many cases where the police use them unnecessarily and without justification, including on children and disabled people.</p> <p>\u201cPolice have the power to use force against citizens when they have to \u2013 using handcuffs, arm restraints, leg restraints, pepper spray, batons.

  "<p>Anjem Choudary, who preached hate over two decades with seeming impunity from legal punishment, has been jailed for five years and six months for his activities to support <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/isis\">Islamic State</a>.</p> <p>Choudary was sentenced at the Old Bailey in London after his conviction in July of urging Muslims to support Isis in a series of talks posted on YouTube. He was convicted alongside his acolyte Mohammed Rahman, 33, who was also sentenced to five years and six months in prison. Choudary\u2019s supporters in the public gallery shouted \u201cAllahu Akbar\u201d (God is greatest) as the judge finished sentencing.</p> <p>The offence carried a maximum of ten years in jail and Choudary will serve two years behind bars, which he believes will be wholly or mostly spent in solitary confinement, to stop him turning vulnerable inmates towards terrorism.<br></p> <p>Choudary, 49, avoided serious criminal charges for years, but his conviction for terrorism was agreed unanimously by a jury.</p> <p>Sentencing the pair, the judge said they would remain a danger, even in prison, telling them: \u201cI regard each of you as dangerous. You show no remorse at all for anything you have said or done and I have no doubt you will continue to communicate your message whenever you can.\u201d</p> <p>The judge added: \u201cThe jury were sure that you knowingly crossed the line between the legitimate expression of your own views and the criminal act of inviting support for an organisation which was at the time engaged in appalling acts of terrorism.\u201d <br></p> <p>The judge said both men justified Isis\u2019s most appalling acts and expressed contempt for democracy. They had \u201cencouraged your audience ... to believe that no one who failed to support the caliphate established by Isis could be a true Muslim,\u201d the judge said. <br></p> <p>Choudary was a key figure for a succession of Islamic militant groups. He was dismissed as a clown by some, but helped motivate at least 100 young people to turn to terrorism in Britain and Europe.</p> <p>The judge imposed an order called a notification period, to last 15 years, meaning conditions could be placed on the pair when they are released.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"b3975c4aee3fefd52affdce5e5d6898342102fb4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b3975c4aee3fefd52affdce5e5d6898342102fb4/37_84_1013_1266/800.jpg\" alt=\"Mohammed Rahman\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mohammed Rahman.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Metropolitan police</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The \u201chate preacher\u201d and Rahman told their supporters to obey <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/27/inside-the-hunt-for-isis-leader-abu-bakr-al-baghdadi\">Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi</a>, the Isis leader, who is also known as a caliph, and travel to Syria to support \u201cthe caliphate\u201d, the trial had heard.</p> <p>He was a key figure in al-Muhajiroun, which was banned under terrorism legislation and relaunched itself as al-Ghurabaa, only to be <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2006/jul/18/terrorism.immigrationpolicy\">banned again</a>.

Summers urged the judge, Mr Justice Holroyde, not to sentence Choudary on the basis of his 20 years of notoriety, or over claims that he had indoctrinated \u201ca generation of people to commit direct acts of terrorism\u201d. He said: \u201cMr Choudary has done his best to stay within the law, acting on the boundaries of it maybe, but determined to stay within the law.\u201d</p> <p>Summers painted a picture of a man touched by remorse, facing solitary confinement, and said Choudary would not offend in the future. \u201cHe has had time to reflect, and on reflection would have done things differently had he known the boundaries of the law.

And to obey them obviously means they must be established,\u201d Choudary says in the clip. </p> <p>Choudary trained as a lawyer and described himself as a student of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/nov/14/omar-bakri-mohammed-arrested-lebanon\">Omar Bakri Mohammed</a>, an extremist who fled Britain in 2005.</p>",
  "<p>Nicola Sturgeon has shelved plans for a quick second referendum on Scottish independence after dire spending figures and a fall in public support for leaving the UK.</p> <p>The first minister told Holyrood on Tuesday that her government only planned to issue a consultation on a draft referendum bill \u2013 a measure which falls short of <a href=\"http://www.gov.scot/programme2016\">tabling new legislation in this year\u2019s programme for government</a>.</p> <p>Two months after telling reporters a referendum was \u201chighly likely\u201d within the next two years, she told MSPs that that bill would now only be introduced if she believed it was the best option for Scotland. </p> <p>Her officials later said that consultation process could start at some time in the next year, with no target date in mind for its launch or its conclusion. Sturgeon\u2019s official legislative timetable, the programme for government, described the referendum as an option and not as a goal. </p> <p>Sturgeon had reacted furiously to the narrow majority among UK voters to leave the EU in the June referendum. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/24/alex-salmond-second-scottish-independence-referendum-is-certain\">On the day of the result, she described it as a \u201cdemocratic outrage\u201d for Scotland</a> since it had voted heavily in favour of remaining in. </p> <p>\u201cThe option of a second independence referendum must be on the table, and it is on the table,\u201d Sturgeon said on 24 June. She said Holyrood had to have legislation ready to put before Scottish voters as soon as the UK government triggered the Article 50 process to leave the EU. </p> <p>\u201cWe must act now to protect that position,\u201d she stressed, announcing that her officials were now preparing that legislation.</p> <p>She had expected that Article 50 would be triggered within three months, and said that would give Scotland two years to stage that vote. However, in Westminster there have been no immediate moves to trigger Article 50, and so Sturgeon no longer has any clear timescale for a second referendum.</p> <p>As she unveiled 14 bills on domestic policy, she told MSPs on Tuesday: \u201cWe will consult on a draft referendum bill so that it is ready for immediate introduction if we conclude that independence is the best or only way to protect Scotland\u2019s interests.\u201d</p> <p>Despite Labour\u2019s jeers at her apparent U-turn in Holyrood on Tuesday, Sturgeon has been slowly and carefully lowering the temperature on a second referendum, gradually stressing the case for increasing Scotland\u2019s influence over the final Brexit deal.</p> <p>That was signalled first with her appointment of the veteran former education secretary, Mike Russell, one of Holyrood\u2019s most experienced and combative figures, to become her Brexit minister last month and lead negotiations with the UK government.</p> <p>She announced last Friday she wanted Scottish National party members to consult two million Scottish voters on their attitudes to independence, to understand why those who voted no had rejected leaving the UK. That morning, a YouGov poll for the Times had found only 40% of voters still backed independence, including don\u2019t knows, while only 37% backed holding a second vote before the UK left the EU. Excluding don\u2019t knows, it found that opposition to independence was at 54% and support at 46% \u2013 the same figure as in the 2014 referendum.</p> <p>Scotland\u2019s official public spending data last month also showed a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/aug/24/scottish-finances-worsen-fall-oil-revenues-15bn-deficit\">\u00a315bn budget deficit last year</a>, partly due to the collapse in oil revenues. That was equivalent to 21% of overall government spending in Scotland or 9.5% of GDP, a budget deficit larger than that of Greece.</p> <p>In a further attempt to stimulate Scotland\u2019s struggling economy, which has grown far slower than the UK average since the 2014 referendum, Sturgeon unveiled plans for a \u00a3500m investment and loans guarantee system for small- and medium-sized firms. There would be a new social security bill to scrap the bedroom tax, introduce new \u201cbest start\u201d grants for low income parents, and a new child poverty bill, which would introduce the UK\u2019s first statutory income targets on child poverty.</p> <p>Her government would press on with the merger of the British Transport police in Scotland with Police Scotland \u2013 a measure the BTP has itself criticised \u2013 along with a new statutory offence of domestic abuse to strengthen action against abusers.</p> <p>She confirmed that the SNP would cut air passenger duty at Scottish airports by 50% from April 2018 to stimulate spending, a plan lambasted by Labour and the Scottish Greens as it would damage efforts to tackle climate change.</p> <p>Claiming that her government\u2019s philosophy was in stark contrast to that of a right-wing Tory government in Westminster, Sturgeon said: \u201cThis means a real battle of ideas. A sense of solidarity versus the ideology of the small state.\u201d</p> <p>Ruth Davidson, the Scottish Tory leader, said Sturgeon should drop the referendum option entirely given the difficulties facing Scotland\u2019s struggling economy. \u201cThe single biggest economic lever that the SNP could pull right now to help the country grow would be to remove the threat of a second referendum,\u201d she said. </p> <p>Kezia Dugdale, the Scottish Labour leader, said the SNP had had nearly a decade in power at Holyrood and had unprecedented new tax powers, yet was still tinkering around the edges of the parliament\u2019s powers.</p> <p>She said rail investment projects were months late, bus services still poor, educational disadvantage remained entrenched, and hospital wards being axed that Scottish ministers had pledged to protect. With Sturgeon now elected as first minister until 2021, Dugdale added: \u201cLet this be five years where focusing on jobs, public services and our economy rank as highly as the SNP\u2019s fight for independence.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>It\u2019s always there, isn\u2019t it? Most of us don\u2019t like it, but what can we actually do about gender-based violence? Sure, the figures are terrible \u2013 violent crimes against women in England and Wales reached record levels last year \u2013 but they\u2019ve been going up for ages. Rape and domestic violence are the new poor, always with us no matter how much we wish it were otherwise.</p> <p>If that sounds cynical, it\u2019s because I\u2019m sick of a glaring disconnect at the heart of our culture. The criminal justice system is struggling to cope with the number of women coming forward with terrible stories of rape, beatings and \u2013 a relatively new one, this \u2013 online forms of abuse such as revenge porn.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/sep/05/violent-crimes-against-women-in-england-and-wales-reach-record-high\" title=\"\">annual report</a> of the director of public prosecutions, Alison Saunders, told exactly this story when it was published earlier this week. Offences against women, including domestic abuse, rape and sexual assault, rose by almost 10% in 2015-16. Stalking prosecutions were up by 7.1%, child sex prosecutions by 15.4% and there were a record number (4,643) of rape prosecutions.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/12/juries-no-place-rape-trials-victims-deserve-unprejudiced-justice-judge\">Juries have no place at rape trials \u2013 victims deserve unprejudiced justice | Julie Bindel</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Cue a great deal of hand-wringing and a weary sense that perhaps violence against women, while regrettable, is inevitable. Just think of all the training, initiatives and public awareness work that\u2019s been done in recent years, yet the picture just keeps on getting worse. Is there really anything that someone \u2013 police, prosecutors, legislators \u2013 hasn\u2019t already thought of and tried?</p> <p>There is, but it requires a dramatic shift in public attitudes. How many times have you heard people express sympathy with a man on trial for rape, asking why the victim had had so much to drink or agreed to go back to his hotel room? Public understanding of the law relating to consent is woefully lacking, and there is a persistent tendency to view women\u2019s behaviour much more critically than that of the men who commit even violent assaults.</p> <p>The same unthinking callousness is shown to victims of domestic abuse, who are often criticised for staying with violent partners even when they have nowhere else to live. There are nothing like enough safe places for victims, a situation that\u2019s going to get even worse when a housing benefit cap hits refuges in 2018.</p> <p>If we are to change the dire situation revealed in annual crime statistics, there has to be an end to a culture of suspicion, denial and victim-blaming. Sometimes I think we\u2019re making progress but every apparent advance is quickly followed by a return to the status quo. Three months ago, after the horrific killing of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/16/jo-cox-killing-shooting-mp-birstall-west-yorkshire\" title=\"\">Labour MP Jo Cox</a>, there was an outpouring of shock and sympathy. That consensus didn\u2019t last long. When other <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jun/18/vile-online-abuse-against-women-mps-needs-to-be-challenged-now\" title=\"\">female Labour MPs talked publicly</a> about receiving rape and death threats, some people went on social networking sites to mock them. They even laughed at<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/mar/06/jess-phillips-someone-to-believe-in\" title=\"\"> Jess Phillips</a> when she posted photographs of a locksmith fixing stronger locks at the home she shares with her children.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>When female MPs talked about receiving rape and death threats, people on social networking sites mocked them</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The attitude that being threatened with sexual violence is just another hazard of the job seems to be widely held, with the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, telling his female colleagues to ignore it. When even the leader of the opposition cannot correctly identify a gender-specific form of abuse, we have reached a startling level of denial.</p> <p>But that is exactly where we are, as I was reminded on the Sunday morning after Cox\u2019s killing part in a BBC TV programme that began by discussing the attack on Cox and then moved on to a call by several public figures, including Sir Cliff Richard, for anonymity for men accused of serious sexual offences. Another of the guests immediately began to talk about false rape accusations, as though the biggest problem we face is the number of men being wrongly accused.</p> <p>This claim was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/mar/13/false-allegations-rape-domestic-violence-rare\" title=\"\">debunked by research</a> published by Keir Starmer, Saunders\u2019s predecessor as DPP. Yet in no time at all we had moved from talking about women as victims of horrendous violence to the idea that they make untrustworthy witnesses. There is nothing unusual about that, sadly, but such assumptions cannot be ignored when we look at the shockingly low rate of convictions in rape cases.</p> <p>According to the DPP\u2019s latest report, just over half of rape prosecutions ended in a conviction last year. That means that fewer than 3,000 men were found guilty in the whole of England and Wales, yet almost 6,000 women reported rapes to the police in London alone. The vast majority are telling the truth but few will ever see their attacker in a courtroom.</p> <p>Violence against women is at epidemic proportions. Some of it is driven by technology but the biggest problem by far is tolerance. A society genuinely committed to gender equality wouldn\u2019t put up with this situation for a moment.</p>",
  "<p>Andr\u00e9s Iniesta says he heard the silence and knew that all he had to do was wait for Isaac Newton. The ball sat up; gravity would bring it down again and, when it did, he would score. It was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2010/jul/11/world-cup-final-holland-spain1\">the 116th minute in Johannesburg and he did score</a>, running to the corner and pulling off his shirt to reveal the message underneath, written in blue marker by Hugo the kit man: \u201cDani Jarque, always with us\u201d. Ten thousand miles away Spain erupted and Jessica cried. Through the tears she saw it: Dani, her Dani.</p> <p>The 2010 World Cup final was the first game Jessica had watched since her husband had died 11 months earlier, aged 26. She watched on television with her mother, Mar\u00eda, and daughter, Martina, 10 months, as the ball sat up. What followed was more than just a goal, Iniesta reveals \u2013 for all of them. It is sunny in Sant Joan Desp\u00ed as, six years on, he explains how that moment pulled him from \u201ca dark place\u201d.</p> <p>Iniesta might not have been there then and without that goal he does not know where he would be now. Perhaps not here at Barcelona\u2019s training ground, one of the world\u2019s most celebrated footballers. Late on the night before the final, with everyone asleep, he quietly opened the door and, without leaving the hotel, set off for a run. Down the corridors he sprinted until he believed he could do this. All tournament the physios, working past 4am, had promised he would be OK even when they thought he would not be. Now, he was \u2013 vulnerable but ready.</p> <p>This was more than Iniesta\u2019s muscles, though; it was his mind. The security of waiting for Newton masked the insecurity and suffering of the months before. In 2009 he won the European Cup and the following summer the World Cup. It should have been the best year of his life; instead it was the hardest. Between the two titles he suffered. \u201cNot depression exactly, not illness either, not really, but an unease,\u201d <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/artist-being-iniesta.html?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\">he says in his book, The Artist, published today</a>. \u201cIt was like nothing was right.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"905b99e0119d964e0056996f65e9831e047a6cf0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/905b99e0119d964e0056996f65e9831e047a6cf0/0_103_4182_2510/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Andr\u00e9 Iniesta\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Andr\u00e9 Iniesta celebrates scoring the winning goal in the 2010 World Cup final against Holland.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jamie McDonald/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Iniesta had played the 2009 final injured, warned not to shoot. In pre-season, still not fit, Carles Puyol delivered news: his friend Jarque, captain of Espanyol, had died. The impact was profound, body and mind suffering together. Tests showed nothing specific physically but Iniesta could not complete sessions, Pep Guardiola telling him to walk whenever he needed, which he did often. They would wait, Guardiola said, and the wait went on. When Iniesta played he was not the same and April brought another injury. The World Cup, the light he sought, risked being extinguished.</p> <p>Iniesta says he had felt as if he was in \u201cfreefall\u201d. Unable to go on, he turned to the club\u2019s doctors, seeking professional psychological treatment. If doing so can carry a stigma, especially in sport, he says: \u201cWhen you need help, you have to look for it: at times it\u2019s necessary. People are specialists; that\u2019s what they\u2019re there for. You have to use them.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I understood that I was enduring a delicate moment but I took refuge in my people and, above all, in football</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>So Iniesta did \u2013 quietly, privately. He needed help; he talks about being \u201con edge\u201d, \u201cvulnerable\u201d, \u201cvictim of something that terrified me\u201d. Team-mates did not know. Nor had he said anything publicly. There is a kind of catharsis, or perhaps a closure, in doing so now. He had talked about Newton before but not what lay beneath, how significant that moment was. What would have become of him without it? What if Spain had not won the World Cup? It is not a glib question.</p> <p>Despite his reluctance to define what he suffered as \u201cdepression\u201d, there is a passage in his book where Iniesta writes that he can \u201cunderstand\u201d how people end up committing a \u201c<em>locura</em>\u201d: how they can end up doing something \u201ccrazy\u201d, an act of \u201cmadness\u201d. What does he mean? In the context it is a powerful word, frightening and uncomfortable: mental health can be delicate, the desperation debilitating and the consequences dreadful.</p> <p>\u201cWhen you\u2019re not right, you experience moments that impact upon you, that worry you,\u201d Iniesta says. His words \u2013 <em>te imponen respeto</em> \u2013 defy simplistic translation but imply fear, a sense of the situation being bigger than you, beyond you, not entirely under control. \u201cThose are difficult, uncomfortable moments [but] to go from there to certain extremes,\u201d he says, \u201c\u2026 well, every case has its peculiarities\u2026\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere are moments when your mind is very vulnerable. You feel a lot of doubts. Every person is different, every case. What I\u2019m trying to explain is that you can go from being in good shape to being in a bad way very quickly.</p> <p>\u201cI never reached the point of saying: \u2018I\u2019m giving up.\u2019 I understood that I was enduring a delicate moment but I took refuge in my people and, above all, in football. I never felt I didn\u2019t want to continue playing. I knew one day I\u2019d take a step forward, maybe the next it would be three, then five \u2026 it\u2019s a process and that\u2019s how you overcome it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cf0c9d0500b9c3ae54cf603d4d421635cee6ee29\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cf0c9d0500b9c3ae54cf603d4d421635cee6ee29/0_182_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Andr\u00e9s Iniesta\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Andr\u00e9s Iniesta celebrates after Barcelona\u2019s 2-0 triumph against Manchester United in the 2009 Champions League final.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Claudio Villa/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cPeople see footballers as different beings, as if we\u2019re untouchable, as if nothing ever happens to us, but we\u2019re people. Of course we\u2019re privileged but in the tangibles we\u2019re the same.\u201d</p> <p>The same? Or perhaps even worse off? Does the exposure, the pressure, the competition and need to perform, the public profile, make it harder? And few jobs expose people so young. The response is swift: \u201cWe\u2019re not martyrs,\u201d Iniesta says. \u201cLots of people would swap with us. Every job has its difficulties. Every time my dad, a builder, went up on the scaffolding, he could have fallen. But he accepts that risk; he had to. Or the lorry driver, or any job\u2026 the footballer knows; he grows up with pressure, criticism, having to be strong. I\u2019m convinced there are many who wouldn\u2019t make it.\u201d</p> <p>Iniesta left home to join Barcelona as a 12-year-old, crying alone in a corner daily. He says the worst night of his life was the first he spent at La Masia while his parents drove back to Fuentealbilla, Albacete in a Ford Orion that kept breaking down.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re lucky to be footballers; my intention in explaining that bad moment is not to make people say \u2018poor thing\u2019, far from it. Just that elements of [a footballer\u2019s] life, the feelings, the difficulties, are like anyone else\u2019s. This is how people\u2019s lives are. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m an exception. It costs <em>una barbariedad</em> \u2013 a colossal amount \u2013 to get to the first team and even more to stay there. I spent my whole life at Barcelona, living with the pressure from the age of 12. But you\u2019re born a footballer, wanting to be one, so it doesn\u2019t matter how old you are.\u201d</p> <p>For almost a year it was as if he was not one, his identity lost.

Winner of over 30 titles; two trebles; every trophy there is; a European Cup winner in 2006 (although he admits that Frank Rijkaard\u2019s handling of the final, which he began on the bench, \u201cdoesn\u2019t sit well at all\u201d), 2009, 2011 and 2015; a European champion in 2008 and 2012; World champion in 2010, scorer of that goal.</p> <p>And he is not about to stop. At 32, no longer playing alongside <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/10/pep-guardiola-manchester-city-barcelona-xavi\">Xavi Hern\u00e1ndez</a> and with Barcelona embarking on a stylistic shift, more direct, it might have been natural for Iniesta\u2019s career to draw towards a close. He might have appeared the natural victim; instead he is enjoying this as never before. He became more central in every sense, a kind of Iniesta <em>and</em> Xavi.</p> <p>The qualities that define him have not diminished; his game is, he says, \u201cintuitive\u201d. Recognisably <em>his</em>: summed up in that photo surrounded by opponents, bigger and more numerous than him. Almost as if it is deliberate, drawing them in, even if he protests: \u201cI prefer one than five!\u201d He explains: \u201cI\u2019ve never seen being small as a disadvantage; everyone has his qualities. Don\u2019t ask me to beat a guy who\u2019s 1.80m in the air: ask me to do other things I\u2019m better than him at.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8af05769db42720a5cebbc4954ea3f2e2f75b999\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8af05769db42720a5cebbc4954ea3f2e2f75b999/0_0_5000_3206/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Andr\u00e9s Iniesta\" width=\"1000\" height=\"641\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Andr\u00e9s Iniesta finds himself outnumbered five to one against Italy at Euro 2012.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Markus Ulmer/Motivio/Cleva Media</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cMost things come from inside, they\u2019re intuitive; that\u2019s the way I am. There\u2019s tactics, strategy but I understand football as something unpredictable, because you have to decide in a thousandth of a second. If the ball is coming and there\u2019s someone behind you, I\u2019m not thinking: \u2018I\u2019m going left or should it be right?\u2019 I just go and it comes off \u2026 well, sometimes it doesn\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>From across the room a friend is listening. \u201cIt always does,\u201d he shouts, laughing. Iniesta squirms a bit and heads in another direction.</p> <p>\u201cThings have changed a bit but the essence will always be the same,\u201d he says. \u201cEverything evolves and changes need time: we didn\u2019t play as well in September [2014] as in [the final] in the 2015 final in Berlin. The style is a product of the players; you have to use [Messi, Neymar, and Su\u00e1rez] and maybe the midfielders have more pitch to cover, but I\u2019m not someone who can only play a certain style or system. Last year was one of the seasons I most enjoyed. I broke my kilometre record, for sure, but that\u2019s not incompatible with my style.\u201d</p> <p>The balance under Luis Enrique bears that out: a treble and a double. Now as they begin another season, a familiar face stands before them in the Champions League: one that looked out from posters by Iniesta\u2019s bunk. The coach who changed the club and changed his career \u2013 and whose career Iniesta changed too. Barcelona versus Manchester City: it is not the draw they wanted but better now than a knock-out. And the reunion will be a fond one.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/10/pep-guardiola-manchester-city-barcelona-xavi\">Pep Guardiola is a radical who will perfect his ideas at Manchester City | Xavi Hern\u00e1ndez</a> </p> </aside>  <p>After two games under Guardiola in 2008 Barcelona had not won and the pressure was huge. Why they had chosen this novice over Jos\u00e9 Mourinho? One day there was a knock on Guardiola\u2019s door. It was Iniesta. \u201cKeep going, mister. We\u2019re training bloody brilliantly,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cThings hadn\u2019t started well but I believed in [Guardiola],\u201d Iniesta says. \u201cI felt a connection. When things come from inside, you know they\u2019re real. I felt that way, like I had to tell him, support him.</p> <p>\u201cWe came back from Euro 2008 and went to St Andrews and you could already see that this was different: the training, the communication, how the manager was. Until then there hadn\u2019t been such a defined style and I identified with it. It changed everything and we needed that.</p> <p>\u201cSince then, if you watch, there are things other coaches have taken on that weren\u2019t done until then: the central defenders coming out to play, or the full-backs. Pulling the pivot further back to begin [moves]. In sessions, instead of the two <em>interiores</em> coming back to receive, he pushed us further forward for the next wave, supporting players higher, offering passing options. You could only come <em>so</em> far; you can\u2019t go past this line,\u201d Iniesta says, signalling the limits with his hand. \u201cAnd they\u2019d watch to make sure, or there\u2019d be cones marking out [that limit].</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a9041291373b16057e86f7f743ef5aa33e98e439\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a9041291373b16057e86f7f743ef5aa33e98e439/2_57_1102_661/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pep Guardiola and Andr\u00e9s Iniesta\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pep Guardiola and Andr\u00e9s Iniesta will be reunited when Barcelona face Manchester City in the Champions League.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alvaro Barrientos/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cAll those ideas were expressed early in sessions. Or, the pressure on the ball after losing possession\u2026 There\u2019d be drills where, if the opposition plays six passes without you getting it off them, they get a point.\u201d Or the goalkeeper? \u201cYes, he\u2019s always been important for us, another player: when the ball comes out from deep, depending on whether your opponents have one or two [forwards], the goalkeeper plays. He allows you to have numerical superiority.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"e3af3a4a3232c184accb117c2e7561108a7df699\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e3af3a4a3232c184accb117c2e7561108a7df699/0_0_443_680/326.jpg\" alt=\"Cover of The Artist: Being Iniesta\" width=\"326\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"><a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/artist-being-iniesta.html?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\">The Artist: Being Iniesta</a> is published by Headline on 8 September 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Headline Publishing</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Joe Hart has found that out already.

I know Nolito well because he was a team-mate here at Barcelona and with Spain. He\u2019s had a great start and hopefully can continue. I\u2019ve admired David Silva for years: I think he\u2019s exceptional. Players learn day to day, from experience, team-mates and managers. I learnt a lot with Pep; he helped me to improve and he\u2019ll do the same at City.\u201d</p> <p>Above all, though, Guardiola wanted Iniesta to be Iniesta, not least during those months when he was not.

Samia\u2019s father had attempted to conceal from police that his daughter had divorced Shakeel, a first cousin who had once been charged with attempted murder.</p> <p>The report said the family felt \u201cdishonoured\u201d by the divorce that she had organised in a Bradford sharia court in 2012 after a brief and unhappy marriage she claimed was never consummated. The divorce also angered Shakeel because it deprived him of the opportunity to immigrate to the UK and become a British citizen, the report said.</p> <p>Samia\u2019s decision to then marry a man from outside her extended family, who as a Shia did not follow the same Sunni school of Islam, had \u201cfurther tarnished the honour of the family\u201d.</p> <p>According to the report, Shakeel and Shahid hoped that once Samia was in Pakistan they could persuade her to abandon her second husband and return to Shakeel. Otherwise, Shahid was \u201cdetermined to go to any extent including taking [his] daughter\u2019s life\u201d, the report said.</p> <p>A local <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/02/police-officer-investigating-killing-of-samia-shahid-arrested\">police officer has been arrested</a> for allowing family members to leave the country.<br></p> <p>The report said Samia was sufficiently worried about her security not to tell her family when she was arriving and to arrange to be collected from the airport by a childhood friend, with whom she left her passport and return ticket as a safety measure.<br></p> <p>The report said they decided to kill her the day before she was due to return to Dubai, having failed to persuade her to stay in Pakistan. </p> <p>Shakeel was said to have confronted Samia in an upstairs bedroom of his large house in Pandori and demanded to know where her passport and return ticket were. After she refused to tell him, he attacked and raped her, the report said.</p> <p>While trying to leave the house and threatening to alert the British government, she was confronted on the stairs by her father, it was claimed.

She serves as executive producer along with the writer and director <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/ava-duvernay\">Ava DuVernay</a>, who made the Oscar-nominated movie <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/dec/05/selma-review-civil-rights-drama\">Selma</a>. </p> <p><strong>Does Oprah appear in it? </strong>She was originally slated to, but she does not. She does appear in OWN\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/jun/21/greenleaf-oprah-winfrey-religious-drama-review-own\">Greenleaf</a>, which proved to be one of the hits of the summer. </p> <p><strong>What is this show about? </strong>When a sugar farmer in rural Louisiana dies unexpectedly, he leaves his debt-riddled farm to his three adult children, all of whom are dealing with struggles of their own. They have to try to get along and keep things afloat. </p> <p><strong>Who are these kids?</strong> The most prominent is the oldest daughter, Charley (Dawn-Lyen Gardner), a wealthy NBA player\u2019s wife with an MBA and a 15-year-old son. They live the life of luxury in LA and she\u2019s even thinking of joining a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2014/feb/16/real-housewives-interview-scott-dunlop\">Real Housewives</a>-esque reality show. As she\u2019s leaving for the funeral, her husband is embroiled in a rape scandal with several of his team-mates.</p> <p>Nova (True Blood\u2019s Rutina Wesley) is a journalist and activist who lives in New Orleans but doesn\u2019t return home very often. She grows pot illegally but gives it away to those who need it medicinally and is embroiled in an affair with a Big Easy cop. She\u2019s also really into some kind of spiritual juju that\u2019s a mix between Christianity and something darker.</p> <p>Ralph Angel (Kofi Siriboe) is her only son and a recent parolee who needs both his father\u2019s and Aunt Violet\u2019s (Tina Lifford) help raising his son Blue (Ethan Hutchison) because his mother is an addict. We\u2019re not sure why he was put away, but his temper threatens to put him back into jail.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Py1GVEAVv4E\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Py1GVEAVv4E?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p><strong>So, let me guess: by the end of the first episode, they\u2019ve decided to run the business together and reclaim the family\u2019s pride?</strong> Not exactly. Actually, it takes three episodes to get there. One of the great things about Queen Sugar is that the pace is as languorous as a summer\u2019s day drinking lemonade in a rocking chair on the porch. It defies the quick plotting that a network show would demand and gives the characters room to explore their emotions. It\u2019s not slow, necessarily, but it is deliberate.</p> <p><strong>Is it any good? </strong>Yes, it is. The stories here aren\u2019t especially original: the poorer siblings being resentful of their more successful sister, a family defending their small business against a greedy landowner, a wronged woman falling in love with a down-to-earth man after her marriage ends. It\u2019s clear how all of these things are going to play out, but it says something about the power of the performances and the storytelling that they are still engaging and emotionally resonant. </p> <p><strong>What other shows is it like? </strong>I would compare it to something like <a href=\"http://www.nbc.com/parenthood?nbc=1\">Parenthood</a> or <a href=\"http://abc.go.com/shows/brothers-and-sisters\">Brothers &amp; Sisters</a>, a conventional family drama where the incidents are small but packed with meaning and history. The most startling moment involves a tractor being repossessed. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/the-great-british-bake-off\">The Great British Baking Show</a> has scarier stakes. Instead of going for the storytelling churn of something like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/apr/25/lee-daniels-taraji-p-henson-empire\">Empire</a>, this takes a much more grounded approach, providing storylines that are specific to this family and community but will also resonate across the spectrum. </p> <p><strong>What does DuVernay\u2019s direction add? </strong>She wrote the pilot and directed the first two episodes, and her style is both beautiful and delicate, rooting the action in struggles that might otherwise seem mundane. Often she focuses her camera on something unlikely: an abandoned house in the background, an old, beautiful tree next to a farmhouse, or a tattoo on a person\u2019s neck. The attention to these incidental details is almost romantic and often breathtaking. The style and the performances DuVernay elicits keeps the show from looking as cheap as Greenleaf at its worst. </p> <p><strong>Is there anything bad about it? </strong>Sometimes the show meanders. It\u2019s fine to take the scenic route to get somewhere, but it\u2019s not always clear what the destination is. The dialogue is also a bit of a problem, with the colloquialisms and character\u2019s nicknames seeming forced rather than organic. </p> <p><strong>Should I watch this show? </strong>Of course you should. It seems as though Oprah and OWN have finally found their groove, and this should be the show to cement the channel\u2019s reputation as a place to find meaningful stories that wouldn\u2019t be told anywhere else. While Sundance\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.sundance.tv/series/rectify\">Rectify</a> uses a slow pace and smart family drama to transcend into the sublime, Queen Sugar is not quite there. But it is a solid effort chock full of characters to care about. We\u2019ve always enjoyed Oprah\u2019s favorite things, and this should be no different. </p>",

Loughton, a Conservative, has taken over as acting chair of the home affairs committee pending the election of a full-time replacement. He was speaking to journalists in Portcullis House, Westminster, flanked by other committee members after the committee\u2019s private meeting where Vaz confirmed his resignation. Loughton said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Keith Vaz came to the meeting of the select committee. He gave a very frank account of what had happened and he told us of his intention to resign as chairman of the home affairs select committee ...</p> <p>The committee listened, I think in sadness, to what Keith had to say and with a good deal of respect. Keith has clearly acted in the best interests of the home affairs select committee and the important work that we do. And with sadness we all accepted that that was the appropriate course of action that he has taken. And we also appreciate the many challenges facing him personally and his family.</p> <p>All members of the home affairs select committee, across all parties, paid very fulsome tributes to the work that Keith has done. It is remarkable that he has been chairman of the select committee for nine years, the longest serving select committee chair. In that time he has overseen the publication of 120 reports and I think he has a reputation for getting the best out of witnesses, for being a robust chair, but also being a fair chair as well. I don\u2019t think it is an underestimate to say the work of the committee under his chairmanship has had a direct and big impact on government policy, on law and also on public opinion at times as well. </p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c2652986f08911f78de1c33d93fbb7290ecf98f7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c2652986f08911f78de1c33d93fbb7290ecf98f7/145_0_515_309/500.jpg\" alt=\"Tim Loughton talking to journalists in Portcullis House.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tim Loughton talking to journalists in Portcullis House.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC News</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57ced27ee4b0f2c90ce7734a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-06T14:29:59.279Z\">3.29pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Nusrat Ghani, </strong>a Conservative member of the Commons home affairs committee, has also been tweeting about Keith Vaz.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Nus_Ghani/status/773162618135740416\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">1/3 It is saddening that Keith Vaz&#39;s time as Chair of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CommonsHomeAffs\">@CommonsHomeAffs</a> has come to an end in these circumstances.</p>&mdash; Nusrat Ghani MP (@Nus_Ghani) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Nus_Ghani/status/773162618135740416\">September 6, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Nus_Ghani/status/773162727279853569\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">2/3 His contribution to strengthening the credibility and effectiveness of the select committee system is respected across the House.</p>&mdash; Nusrat Ghani MP (@Nus_Ghani) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Nus_Ghani/status/773162727279853569\">September 6, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Nus_Ghani/status/773162814999527424\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">3/3 However, it is right that he has stepped down now, in order that the Committee&#39;s work is able to carry on free of distraction.</p>&mdash; Nusrat Ghani MP (@Nus_Ghani) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Nus_Ghani/status/773162814999527424\">September 6, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57cece75e4b0955f84308e10\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-06T14:12:11.215Z\">3.12pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Chuka Umunna</strong> has also been tweeting about Keith Vaz\u2019s resignation.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ChukaUmunna/status/773132533819203584\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">1/3 Keith Vaz has done a fine job chairing our committee for almost a decade, a view widely shared across the House <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CommonsHomeAffs\">@CommonsHomeAffs</a></p>&mdash; Chuka Umunna (@ChukaUmunna) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ChukaUmunna/status/773132533819203584\">September 6, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ChukaUmunna/status/773132649527476225\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">2/3 I am very sad to see Keith step down but believe he has made the right decision by Parliament and those we serve <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CommonsHomeAffs\">@CommonsHomeAffs</a></p>&mdash; Chuka Umunna (@ChukaUmunna) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ChukaUmunna/status/773132649527476225\">September 6, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ChukaUmunna/status/773132768171724800\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">3/3  It is incredibly important the Committee carries on the important work we are doing scrutinising Government. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CommonsHomeAffs\">@CommonsHomeAffs</a></p>&mdash; Chuka Umunna (@ChukaUmunna) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ChukaUmunna/status/773132768171724800\">September 6, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57cecd1ce4b0d24abcb74e94\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-06T14:06:23.740Z\">3.06pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><em>Q: Has the work of the committee been undermined by Vaz\u2019s actions?</em></p> <p>Loughton says he does not think so.

I am genuinely sorry that recent events make it impossible for this to happen if I remain chair. I have always been passionate about select committees, having served as either chair or member for half of my time in parliament. The integrity of the select committee system matters to me. Those who hold others to account, must themselves be accountable.</p> <p>I am immeasurably proud of the work the committee has undertaken over the last 9 years, and I am privileged to have been the longest serving chair of this committee. This work has included the publication of 120 reports, hearing evidence from ministers 113 times, and hearing from a total of 1379 witnesses. I am very pleased that so many members of the committee have gone onto high office and ministerial positions.</p> <p>I told the committee today of my decision to stand aside immediately from committee business, and my intention to resign. This is my decision, and mine alone, and my first consideration has been the effect of recent events on my family. I have recommended that in the interim, Tim Loughton MP, the senior Conservative member, should Chair proceedings.After speaking to the House authorities, I will formally tender my resignation to Mr Speaker so that it coincides with the timetable for the election of other committee chairs, such as the Brexit Committee, Culture, Media and Sport, and Science and Technology, so that the elections can take place together.</p> <p>I would like to thank my fellow members of the committee, past and present, for their tremendous support.

But there have not been many other senior Labour figures speaking out in the media on Vaz\u2019s behalf, and no doubt Vaz will be grateful for what Livingstone said about him on the BBC\u2019s Victoria Derbyshire show.</p> <p>Livingstone was characteristically combative but, not for the first time, he ended up banging on about Hitler (in response to a question about his suspension from the part).</p> <p>Here are the key points.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Livingstone defended Vaz, saying that what he did in private was up to him.</strong> \u201cI think someone\u2019s private life should be private,\u201d he said. Livingstone insisted that the story about Vaz sleeping with two male escorts was as yet unproven.</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Let\u2019s see what turns out to be true. I could spend the next half an hour recounting to you all the stories you\u2019ve seen about me in the press that turned out not to be true.</p> </blockquote> <p>But, even if it was true, it was a private matter, he argued. He also insisted that it was wrong to condemn someone like Vaz for a single \u201cmistake\u201d. He explained:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The simple fact is, don\u2019t judge somebody on one mistake they make in their life, or even a couple of mistakes. It\u2019s the total that he\u2019s done for other people, in his own constituency and up and down Britain. He\u2019s always been on the side of justice. And that can\u2019t just be swept away by one mistake that he has made.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He effectively accused journalists of hypocrisy, saying he had seen political correspondents at party conferences picking up prostitutes.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>What I find particularly ridiculous about this is I can recall being at Labour party conferences and watching journalists there going up to their hotel room with prostitutes they picked up from the streets. All across our society there are people that pay for sex. I don\u2019t approve of that. I don\u2019t do it myself. But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s illegal.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He dismissed suggestions that, if Vaz has paid sex workers, there was a conflict of interest because his committee is investigating prostitution.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I don\u2019t think the fact that, if it turns out to be true, and he has paid for sex, that prevents him from actually conducting an inquiry into prostitution and the problems of prostitution. The problem of prostitution is what happens to the poor prostitutes, not so much their clients.</p> </blockquote> <p>When he was asked if he was happy about a Labour colleague exploiting young immigrants for sex, Livingstone repeated his belief that the allegations were unproven.</p> <ul> <li><strong>He claimed that the Labour party is delaying the disciplinary hearing into his Hitler remarks because it knows he was right.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I think they keep putting if off because the simple fact is I\u2019ve got so much evidence that says what I was saying was true. Particularly striking, if you go to the Holocaust Memorial in Jerusalem, one of the pamphlets they sell to tourists is about the deal that Hitler did with the Zionists in the 1930s. So I don\u2019t think anyone is going to accuse the Holocaust Memorial management of being antisemitic.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5a31c1ad1b78ec4f79b3ad7bdc4bfef27d96a920\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5a31c1ad1b78ec4f79b3ad7bdc4bfef27d96a920/29_0_775_465/500.jpg\" alt=\"Ken Livingstone on the BBC\u2019s Victoria Derbyshire show.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ken Livingstone on the BBC\u2019s Victoria Derbyshire show.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC News</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-09-06T10:27:49.106Z\">at 11.27am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57ce9296e4b0456abb93dc14\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/henrymcdonald\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-06T10:01:24.687Z\">11.01am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Belfast will lose one of its four Westminster/Stormont Assembly seats under new recommendations from the Boundary Commission.

Outside of the city the number of seats would remain the same but under new names. </p> <p>The recommended changes have upset both unionist and nationalist parties. Sinn Fein\u2019s <strong>Alex Maskey</strong> said his party had concerns that the recommended changes would also reduce the number of Stormont Assembly seats to 16 or less. <strong>Lord Empey</strong> of the Ulster Unionists said the proposals would mean places like Lisburn and Ballymena would be \u201ccut off from their natural hinterlands\u201d by the boundary changes.</p> <p>The changes also put under threat the Ulster Unionist seat won back from Sinn Fein in the last general election, Fermanagh/South Tyrone.

He welcomed Rudd to her role and asked about terrorism suspects who had fled Britain while on police bail to join Islamic State. Vaz made no mention of the newspaper reports.</p> <p>Vaz could face an investigation by the commissioner for standards over the newspaper claims. It was alleged that he met male eastern European sex workers at a flat he owns in north London. According to the paper, Vaz asked one of the men in a text message sent before the encounter to bring poppers.</p> <p>Vaz had argued in parliament that poppers should not be included in a list of substances banned by the 2016 Psychoactive Substances Act. He is quoted in the Sunday Mirror as telling the escorts that he did not use poppers himself.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/05/what-does-the-sunday-mirror-allege-keith-vaz-did-and-is-it-illegal\">What does the Sunday Mirror allege Keith Vaz did \u2013 and is it illegal?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Vaz reportedly told the men that his name was Jim and he was a washing machine salesman.

  "<p>Europe has met a landmark goal of slashing its energy consumption six years ahead of time, cutting greenhouse gas emissions equivalent to <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/energy/en/topics/energy-efficiency\">switching off about 400 power stations</a>.</p> <p>In 2014, the EU\u2019s 28 member countries consumed 72m tonnes of oil equivalent less than had been projected for 2020, according to <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/jrc/en/news/eu-final-energy-consumption-below-2020-targets\">a report</a> by the EU\u2019s science arm, the Joint Research Centre (JRC). The figure matches Finland\u2019s annual energy use.</p> <p>Environmental campaigners described the achievement as \u201cremarkable\u201d. and \u201cincredible\u201d but the European commission was restrained. </p> <p>\u201cFinal energy consumption is currently below the 2020 target,\u201d a spokeswoman for the commission said. \u201cThe EU-28 are are also on a good pathway to achieving the primary energy consumption target for 2020 if current efforts are maintained.\u201d</p> <p>Major energy savings were reported across all sectors in the study, with EU legislation driving efficiency gains in electrical products, industry installations, fuel economy and the housing sector.</p> <p>Energy use in residential buildings fell by 9.5% between 2000 and 2014, second only to the industrial sector, where there was an energy drop of 17.6% over the same period.</p> <p>But energy analysts were concerned that the UK government \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.euractiv.com/section/energy/news/uk-fails-in-new-bid-to-water-down-energy-efficiency-directive/\">seen as dragging its feet on energy efficiency measures</a> \u2013 could move in the opposite direction once no longer bound by EU legislation.</p> <p>Ingrid Holmes, the director of the E3G thinktank in London, said: \u201cBrexit creates enormous uncertainty over how the UK will continue to provide affordable and secure energy to its people. Energy efficiency works \u2013 and it\u2019s time the government committed to at least match the ambition of energy saving actions taken by the rest of Europe.\u201d</p> <p>Several EU directives maligned by Eurosceptics and industry groups played a key role in reaching the non-binding efficiency target of reducing final energy use 20% by 2020 compared with projected use that year, according to the report. These included laws on energy efficiency, eco-design, buildings performance and fuel economy.</p> <p>By contrast, the fast-growing service sector, which was left untouched by EU directives, recorded a 16.5% spike in energy use.</p> <p>Adrian Joyce, the secretary general of EuroAce, the building efficiency group, said: \u201cThe building sector made a massive contribution to this achievement, particularly residential buildings, which politicians see as the toughest part to reach.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPeople might find it incredible that we reached our final energy use target ahead of the deadline but it is a demonstration of what good EU policy can achieve.\u201d</p> <p>The EU has set a 27% efficiency goal for 2030, and could potentially increase it next month when the commission brings forward a raft of efficiency measures. </p> <p>The focus will be on updating buildings and efficiency directives, with an outside chance that the eco-design plan could also be published.</p> <p>That blueprint, with its widely trailed <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/feb/28/eu-inefficient-toasters-ban-delayed-avoid-pro-brexit-press-attack\">short-circuiting of wasteful toasters</a>, was delayed by fears that tabloids would campaign over the issue during the EU referendum.</p> <p>Eurosceptics and environmentalists may at least be united in pointing to the JRC report\u2019s cautioning that financial crisis played a part in several countries\u2019 reductions in energy use. \u201cIt has contributed to get energy consumption back on track towards the EU energy and environmental targets for 2020,\u201d the study said.</p> <p>Pieter de Pous, policy director at the European Environment Bureau, said: \u201cWe need a real decoupling of energy use from economic growth or the moment the economy picks up, we will be back to square one.\u201d</p> <p>While the EU met its final energy use target in 2014, it was 1.5% shy of its primary energy goal, which could yet be affected by any squandering of energy in the next five years.</p> <p> \u201cWithout the economic crisis we would not be here,\u201d said Monica Frassoni, the president of the European Alliance to Save Energy. \u201cWe need more measures and stringent targets.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>A Nepalese army officer has been cleared of torturing suspected Maoist detainees following years of investigation by Scotland Yard and two war crimes trials at the Old Bailey.</p> <p>Lieut Col Kumar Lama, 49, was charged under a rarely used clause of the 1988 Criminal Justice Act that allows the prosecution in the UK of alleged foreign war criminals.</p> <p>Lama was arrested in 2013 after settling in St Leonards-on-Sea, East Sussex, with his family. He had been serving as a UN peacekeeper in South Sudan shortly before being detained.</p> <p>He was accused of mistreating prisoner Janak Raut during his country\u2019s civil war, which raged between 1996 and 2006. The Old Bailey trial heard that he presided over beatings of his alleged victim while in charge of the Gorusinghe barracks in Kapilvastu. Lama has always denied the charges.</p> <p>It was claimed that one of Lama\u2019s more unusual torture methods was to allow a soldier\u2019s pet parrot to peck at the victims until they bled.</p> <p>Lama first stood trial in February 2015 but the jury was discharged following the failure to provide sufficiently qualified translators to hear the evidence of about a dozen Nepalese witnesses who had been flown to the UK.</p> <p>Last month, a second jury was discharged after failing to agree on a verdict on the remaining torture charge. On Tuesday, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) announced it would offer no further evidence against Lama.</p> <p>The prosecutor, Duncan Penny QC, said: \u201cThe crown has carefully and thoroughly considered the evidence on the remaining count and there was no longer a realistic prospect of conviction.\u201d</p> <p>The judge, Mr Justice Sweeney, told the jury: \u201cIt is relatively rare for so many witnesses to require interpreters and indeed for so many problems to arise in one case.\u201d He assured Lama that he would face no further action in British courts.</p> <p>Section 134 (sub-section 1) of the Criminal Justice Act permits prosecution of foreign war criminals in the UK under so-called universal jurisdiction. The UK is one of 159 signatories to the UN convention against torture and perpetrators must be tried in the country in which they are arrested.</p> <p>The two trials are estimated to have cost about \u00a31m. His solicitor, Jonathan Grimes, a criminal law partner at the law firm Kingsley Napley, said: \u201cI am extremely pleased for Col Lama that this case is finally at an end and that he can put these allegations behind him. </p> <p>\u201cThe jury\u2019s verdict in August on one of the charges, and today\u2019s decision by the CPS on the other, confirm what Col Lama has always maintained: that he never ordered, or was complicit in, torture. </p> <p> \u201cThe past three-and-a-half-years has been an extremely frustrating and stressful period for Col Lama and his family. There have been unacceptable delays in bringing this case to a conclusion, none of which have been any fault of his. </p> <p>\u201cHe has borne these delays with great patience and good spirit and has always trusted that justice would prevail. I am pleased that Col Lama, an officer who has served with distinction with both the Nepalese army and the UN, will now be able to return to Nepal and resume his military career.</p> <p> \u201cThis case has run into a number of difficulties, in particular, the complexities arising from the fact that most evidence was in Nepal and in Nepalese and that the witnesses were located in Nepal. The reliance by British police and the CPS on evidence gathered by a human rights organisation, Advocacy Forum, has proven to be a mistake.\u201d</p> <p>Janak Raut, one of the alleged victims, said he respected the jury\u2019s decision but hoped the government of Nepal would consider legal action. </p> <p>Daniel Machover, a solicitor at the law firm Hickman &amp; Rose, which represented Raut, and an expert in international criminal jurisdiction, said: \u201cWe have worked very hard on a number of these cases and it is a source of great satisfaction to know that the UK takes seriously its international obligation to investigate and where appropriate to prosecute alleged crimes of this nature.\u201d</p> <p>Mandira Sharma, founder of Advocacy Forum, said: \u201cRegardless of the decision not to re-prosecute Mr Lama, the case has already established that the door of universal jurisdiction for the victims of torture and other gross violations is open in the UK and beyond. </p> <p>\u201cI just hope the government of Nepal understands the gravity of the issue at hand and starts a process to end impunity for torture and gross violations of human rights in Nepal.\u201d</p> <p><br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p><em> <br></em></p>",
  "<h2>ONE EL OF A STORY</h2> <p>Europeans may just be making their very first shaky steps on the long and gilded road to Russia 2018, but elsewhere, like a line of Martin Skrtels defending a string of set pieces, push has very much come to shove. In the North and Central American region snappily rechristened Concacaf in football circles, Tuesday night is decision night, the last round of matches in the fourth and antepenultimate stage of qualifying. Mexico\u2019s place in stage five is assured, Costa Rica and Panama have sailed through Group B and USA! USA!! USA!!! will emerge from Group C with Trinidad &amp; Tobago unless they lose to the Soca Warriors and Guatemala go goal-crazy against a St Vincent &amp; Grenadines side whose defence is less impressive than a Sports Direct shelf-stacker\u2019s benefits package. Which leaves only the vexed question of who will come second in Group A.</p> <p>Honduras hold a shaky advantage, being as they are three points and a goal differential of five ahead of third-place Canada, who they beat in San Pedro Sula last Friday. But they must still visit Mexico City\u2019s Aztec Stadium, where \u2013 for all their happy memories of winning there in 2013 \u2013 they will almost certainly lose, while Canada\u2019s final game is at home to group whipping boys, El Salvador. To be fair, Canada emphatically failed to whip them when they met last November, labouring instead to a goalless draw, but matters will surely be different in Vancouver. After all, the Canucks go into the game knowing they will probably need to win by at least a couple of goals, and what motivation do El Salvador have?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/06/el-salvador-players-allege-bribe-canada-2018-world-cup-qualifier-honduras\">El Salvador players allege bribe over Canada World Cup qualifier</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This last question appears to have particularly troubled a mysterious deep-pocketed Honduras-supporting lair-dwelling cat-stroking semi-villain. A businessman, named by Salvadoran newspaper La Prensa Gr\u00e1fica as Ricardo Padilla, met some of the Salvadorian side over the weekend on behalf of \u201ca friend\u201d whose name he was \u201cnot authorised to say\u201d, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/06/el-salvador-players-allege-bribe-canada-2018-world-cup-qualifier-honduras\">offering them a complicated incentivised cash-making scheme</a>: $30 per player per minute played if they win in Canada (that\u2019s a maximum of $2,700, maths fans), $20 if they draw, $15 if they lose by a single goal, and not a dime if they let themselves suffer a thorough pasting. \u201cListen, match-fixing is when you get paid to lose, but there\u2019s none of that here,\u201d Padilla said, although there was a bit of that, kind of. \u201cLook, it\u2019s not my offer. If you don\u2019t want it, no problem. I came to see if you were interested. I am sure that you are interested in money. But if you don\u2019t accept, no problem. What I\u2019m doing is legal. Where\u2019s the harm?\u201d</p> <p>He was, essentially, encouraging the El Salvador side to play well, or at least not terribly badly, which doesn\u2019t sound particularly scandalous on the face of it. But if you\u2019re going to wave cash in the face of a footballer, it\u2019s probably wise not to pick those from a nation which handed life bans to 14 players for match-fixing less than three years ago. That kind of thing can make a player nervous. \u201cWe thank you for the time you took to come and make this proposal,\u201d one of them told Padilla at the end of the meeting, \u201cbut no one has accepted it. Tell your friend not to worry.

After a bad week, Dinoire, who was a seamstress, had taken a large dose of sleeping pills \u201cto forget\u201d her troubles.

She had no mouth and her teeth and gums were exposed, skull-like, in a \u201creminder of death\u201d. Most of her nose was missing. But she said she had no hatred for her dog Tanya, who she felt had been trying to save her.</p> <p>It was through British press reports that she discovered her donor had killed herself.

Milwaukee owns the unsavory distinction as one of nation\u2019s most racially segregated, and a place where deindustrialization has hit the black community especially hard.

  "<p>So your politician did something with his penis. In an age of duelling sympathies \u2013 free speech v invasion of privacy, opposing revenge porn v exposing moralistic hypocrisy \u2013 it can be difficult to navigate quite how to feel. Should we care? Should we rage? Should we leave adult human beings to manage their own genitals? Should adult human beings who apparently cannot even be trusted to keep their own genital secrets a secret be trusted with very important big secrets, such as the President\u2019s Book of Secrets?</p> <p>Well, it depends.</p> <p>In Britain this week, an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2016/sep/05/why-the-sunday-mirror-was-justified-in-exposing-keith-vaz\">expos\u00e9 by the Sunday Mirror revealed MP Keith Vaz</a> allegedly enlisting the services of two male sex workers and offering to pay for cocaine. The tabloid justified its intrusion into Vaz\u2019s private life by arguing that his position as chair of the home affairs select committee \u2013 which, after an extensive inquiry, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/jul/01/decriminalisation-of-sex-workers-in-england-and-wales-backed-by-mps\">recently recommended the decriminalisation of sex work</a> \u2013 constituted a conflict of interest (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/06/keith-vaz-resigns-as-chair-of-home-affairs-select-committee\">Vaz has now resigned from the committee</a>).</p> <p>That stance has been taken up and loudly championed by opponents of full decriminalisation, eager to use Vaz\u2019s personal violation as a cudgel to discredit the committee\u2019s findings. As Joan Smith <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/05/keith-vaz-home-affairs-committee-chair-prostitutes-sex-trade\">wrote in this paper</a>: \u201cTo put it bluntly, he appears to have chaired hearings where campaigners proposed a change in the law that could, in theory, turn his own private behaviour into a criminal offence.\u201d</p> <p>In the US last week, former congressman Anthony Weiner strode boldly into <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/29/anthony-weiner-sexting-twitter-scandal\">yet another sexting scandal</a> (his third), his passion for a career and a marriage apparently superseded by his passion for showing strange ladies what the outline of his penis looks like in boxer briefs. Which is fine, of course. We all have our hobbies and priorities. (Perhaps, though, Weiner\u2019s lot is more accurately characterised not as a life intermittently derailed by public tumescence but as one long, continuous <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/29/did-anthony-weiner-want-to-get-caught-sexting\">sext</a> with the occasional breather.)</p> <p>This time around, Weiner upped the grimace factor by taking a photo of his activated crotch about six inches from the head of his sleeping toddler. He also used that one-big-eye-one-small-eye-waggy-tongue emoji a lot, which should be illegal.</p> <p>And by sending his penis pics to a \u201cbusty brunette\u201d Trump supporter who gleefully made them public, Weiner handed the GOP fodder for several weeks of significance-free yowling about Hillary Clinton, whose longtime aide, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/29/anthony-weiner-controversy-hillary-clinton-campaign\">Huma Abedin, happens to be Weiner\u2019s now-estranged wife</a>. The implicit message in the Abedin melee is the same one that has clung to Clinton for decades: \u201cIf she can\u2019t even satisfy her husband, how can she possibly satisfy America?\u201d (Because this retrograde country\u2019s first female president can\u2019t just be a politician \u2013 she\u2019ll also have to be America\u2019s wife and mommy.)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"32c7d0c31f309044b54fce0e39e64759f4faf9f4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/32c7d0c31f309044b54fce0e39e64759f4faf9f4/0_247_4005_2403/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Anthony Weiner, as then New York mayoral candidate, with his now-estranged wife and longtime Hillary Clinton aide Huma Abedin in 2013.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Anthony Weiner, as then New York mayoral candidate, with his now-estranged wife and longtime Hillary Clinton aide Huma Abedin in 2013.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kathy Willens/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The case for the newsworthiness of the Weiner scandal appears to be that his name is Weiner and he does things with his wiener.

But, as <a href=\"http://www.thestranger.com/slog/2016/08/29/24525226/anthony-weiner-caught-doing-what-weiner-does-best\">sex columnist Dan Savage notes</a>, our love of a lurid tabloid story and a penis pun really doesn\u2019t justify posting someone\u2019s private sex pics without their consent:</p> <p>\u201cMaking private sext messages public? Do it to anyone else, you\u2019re the asshole. Do it to Anthony Weiner, he\u2019s the asshole. Why the double standard? Posting dirty pictures or videos that were shared with you privately \u2013 or made with you privately \u2013 without the consent of the person in those pictures or videos is called revenge porn and it\u2019s a crime in many states.\u201d</p> <p>So how do you tell if you\u2019re looking at a newsworthy sex scandal or a prurient, exploitative one? Pretty simple. Just ask yourself:</p> <p>1. Was this politician engaged in legal, consensual penis shenanigans (cheating, sexting, canoodling) or wicked, life-ruining penis crime (sexual harassment, rape, domestic violence, child pornography)?</p> <p>2. In their capacity as a lawmaker, did this politician push oppressive, socially conservative legislation that regulated or criminalised the consensual, private sex lives of others? Did they yell all the time about gay people burning in hell or encourage parents to send their kids to abusive gay conversion camps or vote against anti-discrimination laws, while soliciting same-sex blowjobs in public toilets? Did they insist that abortion is baby-murder while procuring expensive secret abortions for their mistresses and daughters?</p> <p>If the answer to 1 is \u201ccrime\u201d or the answer to 2 is \u201cYUP,\u201d or if you\u2019ve got yourself <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/apr/27/dennis-hastert-sentenced-prison-child-molestation\">a twofer like former US house speaker Denny Hastert</a>, then congrats! That\u2019s a scandal that actually means something. If not, and, on top of everything, you find yourself gawking at someone\u2019s private correspondence that\u2019s been dredged up by vultures or homophobes with an agenda, maybe take a pass.</p> <p>By this metric, political stings for prostitution only matter if you believe that paying for sex should be criminalised (I don\u2019t \u2013 I prefer to listen to sex workers when they tell us what keeps them safe). And Weiner\u2019s escapade is a non-event. He\u2019s not even a politician any more \u2013 just a guy who probably shouldn\u2019t be in a monogamous marriage and wants to show his penis off to brunettes in the (illusory) privacy of his own phone. I understand why Abedin would care. It is hard for me to care.</p> <p>Come on. Stop. Talk about real stuff, not this sideshow. (Also, abolish that emoji.)</p>",
  "<p>Theresa May\u2019s government is drawing up plans to end the ban on new grammar schools and allowing existing ones to expand and reform, according to a document written by the most senior civil servant in the Department for Education.</p> <p>Details of the radical expansion policy, which the Guardian understands could be unveiled within weeks, were revealed after a man  was photographed holding a piece of paper outlining the proposal on his way into Tuesday\u2019s cabinet meeting.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/sep/06/keith-vaz-resign-no-confidence-quit-as-commons-home-affairs-committee-chair-politics-live\">May plans to open new grammar schools, confidential document reveals- Politics live</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The note by Jonathan Slater, the permanent secretary at the DfE, talks of a \u201ccon doc\u201d \u2013 thought to be short for consultation document \u2013 that says \u201cwe will open new grammars, albeit that they would have to follow various conditions\u201d.</p> <p>He said the education secretary, Justine Greening, was clear that the policy should be presented as an option but added that it should \u201conly be pursued once we have worked with existing grammars to show how they can be expanded and reformed in ways which avoid disadvantaging those who don\u2019t get in\u201d.<br></p> <p>Slater, who sources said might have been the man holding the piece of paper, said the caveat sounded reasonable to him, because: \u201cI simply can\u2019t see any way of persuading the Lords to vote for selection on any other basis.\u201d</p> <p>The embarrassing revelations triggered an angry response from the Labour party, with a warning that peers could line up to block the plans. </p> <p>Angela Smith, Labour\u2019s leader in the Lords, said May ought to take such a significant policy to the electorate, through a general election, before putting it into place. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Tweet\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;I&amp;#39;ve lost count of the times I have told people to get folders in No10, this seen this morning as Cabinet underway &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/YK3CESjBrg&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/YK3CESjBrg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Political Pictures (@PoliticalPics) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/PoliticalPics/status/773129117839593472&quot;&gt;September 6, 2016&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;script async src=&quot;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>\u201cIf the Tories are set on bringing back grammar schools, Theresa May should seek a political mandate to do so. Trying to slip it in under the radar is completely unacceptable and it won\u2019t wash with peers from all corners of the House of Lords,\u201d Lady Smith said. </p> <p>Angela Rayner, the shadow education secretary in the Commons, said the picture had \u201clet the cat out of the bag\u201d. She argued that any expansion of grammar schools, which limit access to students who pass the 11-plus exam, was \u201cregressive\u201d and would send society back to a time when children were \u201ceither written off or told they could be amazing leaders\u201d.<br></p> <p>\u201cYou were the elite or you were the failure. If you talk to people who have been through the 11-plus, they will tell you how divisive it was even within families,\u201d she said, arguing that parents paid thousands of pounds for tuition to help their children gain entry. Some spend \u00a35,000 a year or more for tutors who offer 99% pass rates. </p> <p>\u201cThe evidence is that grammars are not the key to social mobility, but they are not willing to listen to the experts who have made it categorically clear that grammars will not help,\u201d added Rayner, who said she was gobsmacked. \u201cThe attainment gap is wider in grammar areas. So they are pandering to their backbenchers \u2013 because they can\u2019t be doing it on evidence.\u201d</p> <p>She pointed to comments this week by the chief inspector of schools, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/sep/05/michael-wilshaw-ofsted-chief-grammar-schools-theresa-may-poorer-children\">Sir Michael Wilshaw, who said any</a> decision to open more grammar schools was a \u201cprofoundly retrograde step\u201d that would damage the prospects of disadvantaged children. </p> <p>Ahead of stepping down from his role in December, Wilshaw said the selective schools had a \u201cwoeful\u201d record on admitting the poorest children, and instead worked against those who were benefiting from reforms made under Tony Blair and, later, Michael Gove.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/aug/23/argument-for-grammar-schools-selective-education-theresa-may\">Got a good argument for\u00a0the return of grammar schools?

But a number of Conservative backbenchers are strongly in favour of selective education, which they see as offering a leg-up to poorer but bright children, and they are pressing May to take action.</p> <p>On Sunday, the prime minister sidestepped a question about new grammar schools.</p> <p>But in response to the leak, a government spokesperson hinted that the policy was on the table: \u201cThe prime minister has been clear that we need to build a country that works for everyone, not just the privileged few.</p> <p>\u201cWe are looking at a range of options to allow more children to access a school that lets them rise as far as their talents will take them. Policies on education will be set out in due course and it would be inappropriate to comment further on internal government documents.\u201d</p> <p>Kevin Courtney, general secretary of the National Union of Teachers, the largest teachers\u2019 union, said: \u201cOpening new grammar schools would not only be a backward step but also a complete distraction from the real problems facing schools and education. For every grammar school, there are three or four \u2018secondary modern\u2019 schools. </p> <p>\u201cAll the evidence makes clear that segregating children in this way leads to lower academic standards. The argument that grammar schools create social mobility are, in the words of the Ofsted chief inspector, \u2018tosh and nonsense\u2019. Evidence shows that in areas which retain grammar schools, disadvantaged students \u2013 who are eligible for FSM [free school meals] or who live in poor neighbourhoods \u2013 are much less likely to be enrolled, even if they score highly on key stage 2 tests.</p> <p>\u201cThere is an opportunity with a new prime minister and a new secretary of state to put education back on the right track. This means addressing the real challenges facing schools such as the funding crisis, teacher recruitment and retention problems, the chaos surrounding primary assessment and the fragmentation in the schools system. We need more coherence, not yet another layer of education provision in England.\u201d</p> <p>The Liberal Democrat education spokesperson, John Pugh, said the suggested concessions in the document suggested the Conservatives would find ways of increasing the number of grammar schools without a full policy that would need to be voted on by MPs.</p> <p>\u201cThe government should be ashamed of themselves,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they think this is the right thing to do, they should bring it to parliament and win the argument. This looks like a desperate plan to avoid parliamentary scrutiny and an inevitable defeat.\u201d One way to expand could be to follow the model being considered in Sevenoaks, Kent, to allow an existing school to build a new site, which would be described as an annexe.</p> <p>Graham Brady, the Conservative MP for Altrincham and Sale West \u2013 within Trafford, one of the few parts of the UK that still has a number of grammar schools \u2013 said: \u201cGrammar schools are popular wherever they exist. There is a strong case for getting rid of the statutory prohibition on new grammar schools to allow parents and communities the type of education that they want.\u201d</p> <p>He argued that part of grammar schools being socially selective was down to falling numbers, meaning the few left were in \u201chuge demand\u201d.</p> <p>Brady also argued that so-called comprehensives could be hugely selective. \u201cSutton Trust research has shown that the most privileged state schools in the country are comprehensive schools in affluent areas which select entirely by house price,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Steve Back, the photographer who took the picture of the memo and who has caught out a number of ministers with similar shots, wrote on Twitter: \u201cI\u2019ve lost count of the times I have told people to get folders in No 10.\u201d<br></p>",

To make the contrast even starker, the main character, Sam (Pamela Adlon), and her three daughters, Max (Mikey Madison), Frankie (Hannah Alligood) and Duke (Olivia Edward), all have dudes\u2019 names. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MRLMAsSHyE\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/9MRLMAsSHyE?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>The white people in Atlanta \u2013 and there are even fewer of them than there are men in Better Things \u2013 serve the same purpose that black actors do on other comedies. That is, they serve to make a point about race in America, before disappearing. For instance, a white colleague is seen to use the n-word around the main character, Earnest (Donald Glover), but not around his much more physically imposing cousin Paper Boi (Brian Tyree Henry) or their gonzo friend Darius (Keith Stanfield). </p> <p>The lack of such characters allows these new, fresh voices to be heard \u2013 and in both shows, they\u2019re vibrant and engrossing. Better Things is a product of the partnership between Adlon and Louis CK \u2013 Adlon served as both a writer and co-star on <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.fxnetworks.com/shows/louie/about\">Louie</a> for several seasons and as CK\u2019s wife on the ill-fated HBO comedy <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://splitsider.com/2013/04/right-before-the-sainting-of-louis-c-k-there-was-lucky-louie/\">Lucky Louie</a>. They created this show together (both serve as either writer or director of many of the episodes) and it shares lots in its DNA with CK\u2019s signature creation. Not only is Better Things about an entertainer trying to raise a group of daughters; it\u2019s also an occasionally meandering, philosophical series of vignettes.</p> <p>Adlon\u2019s character, Sam, is much more sympathetic and down-to-earth than the Pamela we met on Louie. Just as CK is <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOaIFgse4Hw\">famous for his riff about how his kids are assholes</a>, Sam has the same sort of antagonistic relationship with her children, scoffing at her oldest daughter when she asks her to score pot but then stealing the condom she finds under her daughter\u2019s nightstand for an assignation with a married man. </p> <p>While there are some rah-rah moments of feminism, like Sam\u2019s speech at a women and girls\u2019 empowerment seminar at her daughter\u2019s school, Better Things is searching for a deeper meaning in how to navigate the world as a woman at all stages of life, both the good and the bad. Imagine <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jul/14/jessi-klein-inside-amy-schumer-the-nonsense-of-being-female\">Inside Amy Schumer</a> were it half as didactic and twice as melancholy. While it sometimes can veer into familiar territories of sitcom schmaltz, Better Things offers essential fresh takes on motherhood, Hollywood and the vagaries of teenage life.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RENJ6WaRA3o\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RENJ6WaRA3o?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Atlanta is as concerned with race as Better Things is about gender. In the show\u2019s second episode, when Earnest finds himself in jail (not to be confused with <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0099512/\">Ernest Goes to Jail</a>), he sees an inmate who is clearly mentally ill. When the cops say the inmate is imprisoned every week, Earnest wonders why they keep locking him up instead of getting him help. The cops treat him gently until he drinks toilet water and spits it at them; then they viciously beat him. It\u2019s comical, harrowing, audacious and sobering all at the same time. </p> <p>That is what makes Atlanta an even better show than Better Things \u2013 in fact, one of the best new shows on television in quite some time. Glover is the star and creator of what feels a little bit like a hip-hop Girls. Earnest is barely employed, broke, and \u201ctechnically homeless\u201d as he pursues his dreams of being a rap manager while trying to raise his daughter. Like <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/lena-dunham\">Lena Dunham</a>, Glover is obviously playing a much less successful and ambitious version of himself. </p> <p>While Atlanta\u2019s observations are as keen as those in Better Things, the show is much more consistent in its laughs and tone. Atlanta also tackles a variety of subjects almost effortlessly, whether it\u2019s homophobia and transphobia, the cycle of poverty, or the fraught relationship between law enforcement and the black community. Just as in real life, these issues can creep up anywhere and at any time, and Atlanta always has smart things to say about them. </p> <p>Everything about this program seems new and vital, stylishly shot in hues that make the projects of Atlanta look like they were washed over with honeycomb and steeped in sunlight. The same is true of Better Things. This is a great step for FX, whose recent comedy duds, such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/jan/21/louis-ck-zach-galifianakis-baskets-clown-tv-fx\">Baskets</a> and <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/jul/16/sexdrugsrockroll-tv-show-about-a-washed-up-rocker-is-a-played-out-tune\">Sex&amp;Drugs&amp;Rock&amp;Roll</a>, deliver the same angsty straight-guy schtick that is pervasive in the world of so-called cutting-edge comedy. Though these new shows share little more than a network, they are also united in their desire to lend a voice to stories that are often ignored or marginalized. They\u2019re both so darn good, audiences might start demanding fewer white guys in just about everything.</p> <ul> <li><em>Atlanta premieres on FX on Tuesday 6 September at 10pm ET.

  "<p>A man from Northern Ireland is facing extradition to the Irish Republic over allegations he was one of the gunmen who staged an attack on a boxing bout weigh-in in Dublin that sparked a murderous gangland feud. </p> <p>Kevin Murray was identified as one of those at the scene of the fatal shooting of David Byrne at the Regency Hotel in Dublin in February, a crown lawyer told Belfast recorder\u2019s court on Tuesday.</p> <p>The 43-year-old was arrested in Strabane in Co Tyrone on Monday on a European arrest warrant, which allows for suspects to be extradited between EU states. </p> <p>Murray appeared to shake and had to be helped into the dock during the hearing. </p> <p>Stephen Ritchie, a barrister acting on behalf of the Irish state, told the court: \u201cThese are serious offences. Three charges arise out of events on February 5 last, at Drumcondra in Dublin, when David Byrne was murdered. This man (Murray) was alleged to have played a central part in the offence.\u201d</p> <p>Bail was refused even though Murray\u2019s defence team produced evidence to show that he has multiple sclerosis. Murray\u2019s lawyer, Des Fahy, said his client had been co-operating with police and living openly in Strabane, and that he had been subjected to \u201csurreptitious identification\u201d by the Irish police. </p> <p>Murray was remanded into custody until Friday, when he will appear again at Belfast recorder\u2019s court. </p> <p>Byrne, 33, was shot dead and two other men wounded in a televised attack on the weigh-in. The murdered man served in a gang controlled by a convicted drugs smuggler, Christy Kinahan, who is based on Spain\u2019s Costa del Sol.</p> <p>The killing of Byrne was carried out by men loyal to another Dublin gangland figure, Gerry \u201cThe Monk\u201d Hutch. The hotel ambush appears to have been a revenge attack for the killing the previous September of Gerry Hutch\u2019s nephew, Gary.</p> <p>Gary Hutch was gunned down in an Andalusian village by Kinahan associates who believed he had a betrayed a major drug shipment in Spain.</p> <p>The gangland war that was sparked by the Regency Hotel shootings has resulted in the Hutch gang sustaining all the subsequent casualties. Ten people have been killed in the ongoing feud. </p> <p>The victims include not just men loyal to Hutch but also innocent people such as Trevor O\u2019Neill, who was shot dead last month while on holiday with his wife and three children in Mallorca. His killers had mistaken him for a gang member because he had happened to be talking to a member of the Hutch family at a bar on the Spanish island.</p>",

  "<p>You know that friend of yours who will literally die if she eats any gluten? Turns out she probably won\u2019t. A <a href=\"http://archinte.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=2547202\">new study</a> has just confirmed what many of us have long suspected: the majority of people who feel the need to eliminate gluten from their diet don\u2019t appear to have any medical reason for doing so.</p> <p>Over the past few years gluten has gone from being an unassuming composite of storage proteins to the biggest supervillain in the culinary world. Consumer studies have found that one in five Americans has reduced the amount of gluten in their diet and around a third of American adults are trying to <a href=\"http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/magazine/2015/01/will-a-gluten-free-diet-really-make-you-healthier/index.htm\">cut gluten out</a>. As food brands continue to latch on to gluten-free \u201chealth\u201d claims the popularity of eating gluten-free only seems set to rise.</p> <p>What\u2019s not rising, however, are medical diagnoses of celiac disease, an autoimmune condition in which eating gluten means you might, literally, die. Indeed, this new research, published in JAMA Internal Medicine, shows that the prevalence of celiac disease has remained relatively stable over the past few years. And this isn\u2019t the first study to hint that maybe, just maybe, gluten intolerance is just in many people\u2019s heads. A <a href=\"http://www.realclearscience.com/blog/2014/05/gluten_sensitivity_may_not_exist.html\">2014 study</a> out of Monash University concluded that non-celiac gluten sensitivity probably doesn\u2019t exist.</p> <p>Of course, this doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that gluten-free-fakers don\u2019t have other gastrointestinal issues. Indeed, some of them seem to have a hard time digesting facts. Namely the fact that their digestive systems are entirely normal.</p> <p>I am not part of the roughly 1% of the American population that suffers from celiac disease. However, I\u2019m afraid I have become decidedly gluten-free-intolerant. Every time someone tells me they are giving up gluten, I suffer from an involuntary rolling of the eyes and spasms of skepticism. I\u2019m not the only one. The popularity of \u201cgluten-free\u201d, you see, has turned into a punchline and it\u2019s become socially acceptable to make fun of people who espouse it. South Park had an episode called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gluten_Free_Ebola\">Gluten Free Ebola</a>, for example, and the <a href=\"http://glutenimage.tumblr.com/\">Gluten Free Museum</a> lets you enjoy famous works of art with the gluten photoshopped out.</p> <p>But while skeptics may enjoy poking fun at the fact that many lifestyle gluten-avoiders have <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdJFE1sp4Fw\">no idea what gluten is</a>, sometimes we can be just as ignorant about the severity of celiac disease. Indeed, all the hype and hilarity about gluten-free can\u2019t be much fun for celiacs. On the one hand, the rise of gluten-free means a greater availability of decent food they can eat. On the other hand, everyone now assumes they\u2019re a posturing douchebag who wants to make the life of restaurant staff a living hell. Their cause isn\u2019t helped by a vociferous Gluten Sensitive Troll Army, quick to respond to any potential criticism of the gluten-free movement with a slew of angry comments, often containing graphic detail of their bowel movements. It\u2019s never a good idea to feed the trolls, particularly if they can\u2019t handle their gluten.</p> <p>Honestly, I feel bad about the authentic celiacs caught up in all this gluten-highfalutin, I really do. As a tolerant person I want to make sure that I\u2019m only mean about the truly intolerable. So what\u2019s to be done? How do we separate the genuinely gluten-free wheat from the chaff?</p> <p>A cafe in Dublin recently came up with one potential solution. <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/WhiteMooseCafe/posts/1789080394705902\">On Saturday</a> the White Moose cafe updated its Facebook page, explaining: \u201cGuests who demand gluten-free food are required to produce a doctor\u2019s note which states that you suffer from coeliac disease. Guests following a gluten-free fad, who don\u2019t even know what gluten is, can cop the fuck on and eat regular food like everybody else.\u201d The post has had 32,000 likes and 9,500 (mainly angry) comments.</p> <p>The White Moose cafe was obviously joking. But I reckon compulsory doctors notes are actually not a bad idea. Indeed, I\u2019d go one step further and make emotional-gluten-support animals mandatory. There is a law of physics, after all, which says that the negative effects of an increase in food faddists can be counterbalanced by a corresponding increase in cute dogs. And who\u2019s going to argue with science? I mean, apart from the millions of people who think they suffer from something that science says they don\u2019t have.</p> <p>If the above proves unacceptable, then deportation is also an option. Newt Gingrich suggested testing people of Muslim background to see if they believe in sharia; why not do the same for gluten-fakers? Being physiologically able to eat pizza but willingly choosing not to is clearly incompatible with western civilization. </p> <p>Finally, I guess we could also all calm down about gluten and let people eat what they want without passing judgment on it. But I mean, really, where\u2019s the fun in that?</p>",
  "<p>The last published report and accounts of 4Children, the leading childcare charity, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/sep/05/childcare-charity-4children-goes-into-administration\">which has gone into administration and transferred its services</a>, make poignant reading. While results were \u201cnot ideal\u201d, things were improving substantially and the organisation was set to return to surplus by March 2016.<br></p> <p>It was not to be. Although seemingly heroic efforts were made to get the charity back on track, reducing its annual deficit from the \u00a32.8m logged in those accounts for 2014-15 to \u00a3123,000 by this March, the rescue effort ran out of road. </p> <p>Facing the loss of two big contracts \u2013 one of which could probably have been tolerated, but not both \u2013 the decision was taken to give up the fight and focus instead on an orderly rundown of the charity to ensure that remaining services for children and families were sustained. \u201cAt the end of the day that\u2019s all that matters,\u201d says Imelda Redmond, 4Children\u2019s chief executive since March 2015. \u201cThat\u2019s all you exist for.\u201d </p> <p>Her words are a salutary reminder for the many charities that will be studying reports of 4Children\u2019s demise and thinking it could be them next. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/aug/07/leading-adoption-fostering-charity-baaf-closes-economic-problems\">After the collapse last year of the British Association for Adoption and Fostering</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/aug/05/kids-company-founder-camila-batmanghelidjh-confirms-charity-closure\">the spectacular implosion of Kids Company</a>, prospects look good for charity insolvency practitioners. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/voluntary-sector-network/2016/aug/26/a-year-after-the-kids-companys-demise-what-have-we-learned\">A year after the Kids Company's demise, what have we learned?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Getting beyond the headlines inevitably linking 4Children\u2019s failure with Redmond\u2019s long-serving predecessor, Anne Longfield, who is now the government\u2019s children\u2019s commissioner, what are the lessons for the voluntary sector? What should other chief execs and trustee boards have in mind as they peer with furrowed brows at management accounts turning redder by the quarter? </p> <p>For Redmond, there are two big learning points. One is that acknowledgement that you are there for your beneficiaries and service users, period. \u201cAdmitting that you can do things better if you do it with someone else is a really brave step for trustees to take,\u201d she says. \u201cBut it\u2019s sometimes going to be the only way to protect the services.\u201d </p> <p>The other lesson, as a chief executive, is knowing when to \u201cmake the call\u201d and accept that the game is up. \u201cThat\u2019s a really hard thing to do,\u201d she reflects. \u201cPeople can get very caught up in the idea that they will be seen as having failed.\u201d </p> <p>For Jo Cleary, who served as 4Children\u2019s chair during its rundown, and who has a background in local government, charities need to be taking a leaf out of the town-hall book and doing what councils have done: sharing back-office functions to cut costs; streamlining management so that reporting lines are fewer and clearer; reviewing areas of work where they may be operating too thinly. </p> <p>\u201cI really feel that a lot of charities need to be looking at their spread,\u201d says Cleary, who was chair of the College of Social Work <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/social-care-network/2015/jun/19/profession-in-shock-as-the-college-of-social-work-forced-to-close\">until ministers withdrew its funding last summer</a>. \u201cBut local authorities need to get better at commissioning them, too. They need to be building more strategic partnerships rather than always going out to contract around price.\u201d </p> <p>It was 4Children\u2019s success in winning childcare contracts \u2013 growing rapidly from a turnover of about \u00a35m in 2004 to almost \u00a330m last year \u2013 that changed the nature of the organisation from the lobbying and campaigning group that had been set up in 1983, when it was called the National Out of School Alliance, and the umbrella body it became in 1990 when it turned into Kids\u2019 Clubs Network. </p> <p>Longfield issued a statement saying she considered the charity was coping well when she left in 2015. \u201cWhen I handed over the reins of 4Children after over 20 years leading it alongside an extraordinarily committed group of trustees, I considered it to be in good shape with a positive future ahead.\u201d</p> <p>However, there are key question on the minds of many observers as to whether the charity\u2019s governance kept pace with its changes in focus. Longfield was chief executive for 21 years; her chair, Pip O\u2019Byrne, who works in the childcare sector with Family Nurse Partnership, was chair and ran the board for a remarkable 32 years, making way for Cleary this spring only after an external governance review by Cass Business School.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Changes made apparently in response to the review included adoption of the sector convention that trustees should serve no more than two three-year terms as standard, with a third term by exception. The charity also established new committees for audit and risk, governance and safeguarding. But it was all too late.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/voluntary-sector-network/2015/nov/04/do-charities-expect-too-much-of-their-trustees\">Do charities expect too much of their trustees?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Friends of Redmond, who was previously chief executive of Carers UK and director of policy and public affairs at Marie Curie, say she arrived at 4Children to find it patently in crisis \u2013 but a crisis the scale of which the board seemed not to recognise.</p> <p> </p> <p>Three trustees resigned in November and December last year and O\u2019Byrne followed in March. Cleary, who joined on the same day that the two contracts were lost, supported Redmond\u2019s recommendation to wind down the operation and seek other homes for the services and 1,000 staff, principally with Action for Children. Only one of 151 services has not been saved.<br></p> <p>Perhaps the biggest failing on the part of 4Children\u2019s leadership was not to have seen the way the service commissioning landscape was changing after 2010, with much finer margins rendering the charity exceptionally vulnerable in the absence of measures to address its cost base and growth-orientated structure. </p> <p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t need to be Einstein to know that was on its way,\u201d says one observer. Maybe not. But there will be more than a few other charities that suffered similar myopia.

The majority simply don\u2019t grasp the reality of disabled lives and that the inequality is brutally pervasive, but McDonnell always speaks with heart (as does sturdy supporter Jeremy Corbyn) \u2013 and outrage, understanding we are citizens, targeted unjustly to carry the weight of the financial crises. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/05/how-can-the-green-party-success-new-leadership-caroline-lucas-jonathan-bartley\" title=\"\">Jonathan Bartley, new co-leader of the Green party</a> spoke with almost painful emotion about his concerns for his disabled son\u2019s future, as independent living is crushed.</p> <p>But while Rights Not Games isn\u2019t about attacking the Paralympics in themselves, it is the perfect opportunity to highlight the wretched depths in which we, <a href=\"https://art4rightsdpac.wordpress.com/portfolio/were-not-superhuman-just-human/\" title=\"\">ordinary disabled mortals</a>, find ourselves, and to highlight how the stereotypes are polarised between superhuman and scrounger.</p> <p>While we\u2019ve had some success (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/mar/06/government-to-review-500m-worth-of-atos-contracts-after-it-failure\" title=\"\">with Atos especially</a>) and kept our profile high, the government\u2019s policies continue to hammer us.</p> <p>On Wednesday we march on Downing Street to <a href=\"http://www.disabilitynewsservice.com/dwp-hides-seven-secret-benefit-suicide-reviews/\" title=\"\">highlight the deaths connected to the work capability assessment</a>, and the distressing nature of what many disabled people go through.

It was a marker of identity.</p> <p>On day one of class, I learned that the region\u2019s boundaries have been constantly contested. I was told that migratory patterns explain some of the dialects of the mountains. And I came to understand that I was Appalachian.</p> <p>I knew that I was a mountain girl. My family had been in Haywood County for generations and one branch of my family tree started or stopped \u2013 depending on your perspective \u2013 when the Cherokee were marched through. But I had to take a class called \u201cExperiencing Appalachia\u201d to even know that I was Appalachian.</p> <p>To \u201cexperience\u201d the region, we studied Foxfire<em> </em>magazines like those that had lined the bookshelves in my childhood living room. We practiced churning butter. We read about quilting. Some of this resonated with me because it was familiar. My Granny painstakingly taught me to quilt one summer, which mostly meant that I spent time watching her pull out all of my sloppy handwork. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"219d7732e0926978a6553c332f1438e62318ab3b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/219d7732e0926978a6553c332f1438e62318ab3b/0_0_500_436/500.jpg\" alt=\"Natalie-Nelson-Illustration-3\" width=\"500\" height=\"436\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>My Granny and Pa, who lived next door, canned homegrown tomatoes and green beans. I knew the difference between half-runners and blue lakes, and know of no sound more satisfying than the <em>pop</em> of lids sealing on the kitchen counter in the late afternoon. But there were plenty of Appalachian traditions that I did not know. And there was nothing markedly Appalachian that we did because we <em>had</em> to. </p> <p>It is true that I had eaten groundhog on camping trips and could name most of the local peaks by sight, but it is also true that I bought incense and spirulina at a health food store in Asheville. I ate more tempeh than I did fatback, and I loved Ani DiFranco and Doc Watson equally.</p> <p>After graduation, I moved to Boston and became, for the first time, an outsider. Like so many before me, it took leaving home to understand it. </p> <p>I suddenly saw details in contrast and became proud of my heritage. I grew tomatoes on the fire escape because it connected me to my Granny, whose tomatoes were a month ahead and a foot taller. As distance helped me understand what it meant to be from the mountains, I began to deeply miss them. I felt like Ivy Rowe in Lee Smith\u2019s Fair and Tender Ladies, who says that she\u2019s like her daddy because she needs a mountain to \u201cset her eyes against\u201d.</p> <p>Yet while I was proud of my home, I was also learning that powerful stereotypes about Appalachia had arrived in places like Boston well before me and had influenced the way that even the most considerate people thought about me. The banjo lick from Deliverance backed many introductory conversations when I said where I was from. Instead of calling people out for their ignorance, I distanced myself from Haywood County. </p> <p>I laughed along.</p> <p> I waited longer and longer to reveal my background. I blended in. During this time, I applied to graduate school. In my visits to prestigious universities in Boston, I actively tried to \u201ctalk right\u201d and hide my accent. One lingering linguistic marker caused me the most panic when I slipped. Long after I attached Gs to my gerunds and bleached out the local color from my language, I stumbled over the word \u201con\u201d.</p> <p>When my mom told me to put my <em>coat on</em>, those words rhymed. She told me to call her when I was <em>on the road</em>. And those words rhymed. To my Appalachian tongue, \u201cown\u201d and \u201con\u201d were pronounced exactly the same way. But not for the rest of the world, I learned. This reminder that I was not from around here meant, to me, that I might not belong in a Boston graduate school.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8802d3e70d559f2d9dcc25dddf7614545a38c54e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8802d3e70d559f2d9dcc25dddf7614545a38c54e/0_7_800_480/500.jpg\" alt=\"Natalie-Nelson-Illustration-4\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>I learned to always use adverbs. I took my groceries from a buggy and put them in a cart. I (nearly) stopped calling my hat a toboggan. I forced my vowels into shape. It worked. I got into graduate school. I got a PhD. I learned to pass. But I lost my voice. With Granny\u2019s chiding in my ear \u2013 \u201cYou\u2019re talking uppity now that you live in Baaaaahston\u201d \u2013 I developed a new way of speaking. And it wasn\u2019t until a decade later that I heard my own repressed voice echoed back to me in West Virginia.</p> <p>Writer and activist Silas House spoke at a conference addressing the theme of \u201cNew Appalachia\u201d, urging his audience to bring LGBTQ<strong tabindex=\"-1\"> </strong>civil rights issues into our classrooms, our scholarship and our conversations in order to make Appalachia a safer place. New Appalachia, for House, was tied to Old Appalachian activism. </p> <p>As soon as he began speaking, I started to understand the new in light of the old. Combined with a quiet thoughtfulness, his manner of speaking awakened in me memories that I had long put to rest. In one moment, his voice cracked as he was overcome with emotion remembering the violence enacted upon queer youth in Appalachia. Throats tightened across the room. </p> <p>He paused and then said quietly: \u201cAnd it will go on and on and on ... \u201d until we \u2013 teachers and writers and students in this room \u2013 commit to change. To an outsider, it might have sounded like he was saying \u201cown and own and own\u201d, but when I heard Silas House repeat this word in this context, I felt the ground shift beneath me.

Her claims unleashed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/jul/07/gretchen-carlson-roger-ailes-fox-news-lawsuit-other-women\">a wave of accusations from other women</a> who encountered Ailes during his decades-long career in television and Republican politics. In the weeks following her lawsuit, more than 20 women contacted Carlson\u2019s attorneys to say they had also been victims. A similar number spoke to investigators hired by 21st Century Fox to look into Carlson\u2019s accusations.</p> <p>Though Carlson sued Ailes personally, Fox News is liable for the settlement of the suit according to a report on the deals in Vanity Fair, which broke the news of the $20m payout. It\u2019s unclear how much of the money Ailes is personally responsible for.</p> <p>In response to the suit, Ailes initially maintained that he fired Carlson over poor ratings. He dismissed her and others\u2019 allegations as categorically false and reportedly called on other Fox News anchors to publicly lend their support. One of the loudest voices in Ailes\u2019s defense, Greta Van Susteren, abruptly left the network on Tuesday. </p> <p>Van Susteren wrote on her Facebook page: \u201cFox has not felt like home to me for a few years and I took advantage of the clause in my contract which allows me to leave now.\u201d According to <a href=\"http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2016/09/fox-settles-with-carlson-then-van-susteren-quits.html\">a report in New York Magazine</a>, the clause stipulated that Van Susteren could leave if Ailes left. \u201cThe clause had a time limitation, meaning I could not wait,\u201d Van Susteren wrote. </p> <p>New York reported that Van Susteren was \u201ctroubled\u201d by the culture exposed by the lawsuit and the investigation by law firm Paul, Weiss.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"7a8e10495dea88715670a96f08b7d79513d90286\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7a8e10495dea88715670a96f08b7d79513d90286/0_322_2634_1580/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Roger Ailes\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Roger Ailes left Fox in July amid a wave of sexual harassment allegations.

Ailes himself has retained Beverly Hills attorney Charles Harder, the lawyer who helped Peter Thiel sue Gawker through proxy Hulk Hogan in a suit that, though the verdict is likely to be overturned on appeal, bankrupted the company and left one of its editors penniless. </p> <p>According to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/61d2be5c-7382-11e6-bf48-b372cdb1043a\">a report in the Financial Times</a>, Ailes wants Harder to help him pursue legal action against New York Magazine and its reporter Gabriel Sherman, who broke many of the stories around Ailes\u2019s decline and fall.</p> <p> With the accusations mounting \u2013 including, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2016/07/sources-kelly-said-ailes-sexually-harassed-her.html\">reportedly</a>, a claim of sexual harassment by the network\u2019s star anchor, Megyn Kelly \u2013 Ailes\u2019s position had become increasingly tenuous. On 21 July, Ailes was ousted from the rightwing cable giant he helped found nearly two decades ago.</p> <p>Claims of harassment and intimidation have continued to emerge in the wake of Ailes\u2019s departure. In late July, Laurie Dhue, a former on-air host, announced her plans for a tell-all book detailing claims of sexual harassment against Ailes.</p> <p>On Friday, Sherman <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/sep/02/fox-news-phone-hack-report-media-matters\">reported</a> that a private investigator hired by Fox News had accessed the phone records of a reporter for Media Matters, a watchdog group that monitors conservative media outlets, at the behest of a Fox executive. In the US, obtaining phone records without permission is a crime. The private investigator allegedly accessed the records around the same time another Rupert Murdoch company, News International, was dealing with a mammoth phone-hacking scandal in Britain.</p> <p>Separately, a longtime aide to Ailes, Laurie Luhn, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/jul/29/roger-ailes-sexual-harassment-fox-news-laurie-luhn\">claimed</a> to Sherman that Ailes had carried on a coercive sexual relationship with her for years. Luhn claimed that Fox News entered a multimillion-dollar settlement with her, and implicated a top Ailes deputy in the alleged effort to silence her, raising the possibility that rumors of Ailes\u2019s misconduct were well-known to the upper echelons of Fox News executives.</p> <p>Two top Ailes lieutenants, Bill Shine and Jack Abernethy, were given promotions after Ailes left and now run the network in his place.</p> <p>Carlson\u2019s is not the only legal action dogging parent company 21st Century Fox. In late August, former Fox News host Andrea Tarantos filed a lawsuit that criticized the network as a \u201csex-fueled, Playboy mansion-like cult\u201d where Ailes, host Bill O\u2019Reilly, and other contributors sexually harassed her.<em tabindex=\"-1\"> </em>A motion that lawyers for Fox News filed last week called Tarantos a \u201cwannabe\u201d and an \u201copportunist\u201d. </p> <p>Ailes left Fox News with a non-compete clause that prevents him from working with a rival cable news network anytime in the near future. A leaked <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/jul/21/roger-ailes-leaves-fox-news-sexual-harassment-claims\">draft</a> of his severance agreement included a $40m payout and a two-year consultant relationship with the cable news network he helped build into a ratings behemoth.</p> <p>Since leaving Fox, Ailes has reportedly begun to <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/17/us/politics/donald-trump-roger-ailes.html\">advise</a> Donald Trump\u2019s presidential campaign. Ailes is reported to be instrumental in Trump\u2019s preparation for the upcoming televised debates with Hillary Clinton \u2013 a series of major media events for which Ailes is uniquely qualified to ready the first-time candidate.</p> <p>In the statement 21st Century Fox issued on Tuesday, Carlson thanked other women who came forward with their own harassment complaints.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m ready to move on to the next chapter of my life in which I will redouble my efforts to empower women in the workplace,\u201d she said. \u201cI want to thank all the brave women who came forward to tell their own stories and the many people across the country who embraced and supported me in their #StandWithGretchen.

  "<p>Crickets bounce, bees wobble, hoverflies dart and <a href=\"http://www.jessicaalbarn.co.uk/\">Jessica Albarn</a> stands in the middle of her steep, sunny meadow and scrunches up her hands in delight. \u201cQuite a bit of my work is about layers,\u201d she says, crouching down to investigate the depth of the grass with her fingers. \u201cIt\u2019s about being able to get right in there and explore an area.\u201d</p> <p>Albarn is a visual artist best known for her beautifully detailed pencil drawings of spiders, bees, butterflies and other insects. Perhaps it is inevitable that peering through a microscope at dead insects in her London studio led her to the lanes of south Devon to create a meadow, and capture some of its richness in a series of artistic adventures.</p> <p>If you feel there\u2019s something familiar about the name, you\u2019d be right: Albarn is the younger sister of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/damon-albarn\">Damon of Blur</a>, and her meadow is on the old farm he bought for his family 20 years ago. \u201cI\u2019m lucky to have this antidote to London,\u201d she says. \u201cDamon bought this as a family place, so we could all have somewhere to meet. This work is part of him, because I wouldn\u2019t have had this otherwise. It\u2019s been wonderful.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9cccfaca2e078e0646bbf6e156ae254de93d28fd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9cccfaca2e078e0646bbf6e156ae254de93d28fd/0_0_3024_3024/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Spider, a drawing on paper.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Spider ... a drawing on paper.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jessica Albarn</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Albarn spent most of her childhood in rural Essex. Her dad, Keith, taught at Colchester School of Art. \u201cIt was great for me as a kid. We had a bit of freedom. You could walk to the woods and down to the river, and I had loads of animals. That\u2019s where it all began for me.\u201d Her mum came from a farming family in Lincolnshire and Albarn thinks a love of the land \u201cis also probably a bit in the blood\u201d.</p> <p>She took her art foundation course under her dad at Colchester (\u201cHe was great, but I had a bit of a hard time from some of the other staff\u201d) and moved to London to complete her degree. She was just getting going as an artist when she gave birth to her daughter, who is now 21, and she has an 18-year-old son. But just when she might have had more time to make art, she had another daughter, who is five. Some artists struggle to continue working with family and financial demands. Albarn has \u201cfought like crazy to keep going\u201d, she says. \u201cI\u2019ve been very dogged about it. Being a woman and having children, your career takes a different path. I didn\u2019t get the opportunity to do an MA, but I\u2019ve found my path \u2013 and it\u2019s made me very disciplined.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6d54acbc34eecdbf2c41968fd44b5ae1098b3323\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6d54acbc34eecdbf2c41968fd44b5ae1098b3323/0_96_4211_2526/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The artist\u2019s meadow at Damon Albarn\u2019s farm in Devon.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Field-good factor ... the artist\u2019s meadow at the family farm in Devon.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jessica Albarn</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>She likes to go out on a forage, she says, and her art \u201cusually begins with something I find\u201d. She has been particularly inspired by bees, and undertook a \u201cbee marathon\u201d at the Natural History Museum, drawing bees all day in \u201chomage to their industry\u201d. She laughs. \u201cEveryone is going on about the bees dying, which is very tragic and depressing, so it is nice to try and do something positive.\u201d </p> <p>Albarn began raising money for the <a href=\"http://bumblebeeconservation.org/\">Bumblebee Conservation Trust</a> and learned of the importance of \u201ccreating corridors for wildlife and wild flowers\u201d. And that\u2019s when she decided to turn a small, steep south-facing sheep field into a meadow. \u201cIt\u2019s incredibly lush down here and there\u2019s a lot of wild flowers, so my parents thought I was a bit mad when I said I wanted to create a meadow. But I hope to encourage two species in particular \u2013 <a href=\"https://bumblebeeconservation.org/about-bees/identification/very-rare/shrill-carder-bee/\">the shrill carder bumblebee</a> and the <a href=\"https://bumblebeeconservation.org/about-bees/identification/scarce/\">blaeberry bumblebee</a>. They are around in this area but they are very, very rare.\u201d</p> <p>Following advice from a BCT outreach officer, she created the meadow. \u201cAlthough I\u2019ve been studying insects for a long time, I\u2019m quite a novice and am learning as I go,\u201d she says. Much of her art mixes insects with geometrical forms and the meadow is marked out in six hexagon shapes \u2013 inspired by beeswax \u2013 arranged in a triangular shape. She and her mum collected as much local seed as they could find (locally sourced seed is always best for \u201cnew\u201d meadows) and bought extra BCT-approved native seeds, and scattered them over the slope.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1da4a23c907122fc268c9aacc389278b29ca82ad\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1da4a23c907122fc268c9aacc389278b29ca82ad/197_0_2239_2798/800.jpg\" alt=\"Albarn at the launch for her illustrated book, The Boy in the Oak.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018My parents thought I was mad\u2019 ...

  "<p>David Davis was expressing his opinion rather than government policy when he said it would be unlikely for Britain to stay in the single market after Brexit negotiations, the prime minister\u2019s spokeswoman has said.</p> <p>The secretary of state for exiting the EU told MPs on Monday that the government\u2019s priority was securing restrictions to European migration, and conceded that there could be an economic price to pay for that.</p> <p>\u201cThis government is looking at every option but the simple truth is that if a requirement of membership is giving up control of our borders, I think that makes it very improbable,\u201d he said,<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/05/david-davis-vows-to-build-national-consensus-on-brexit\"> during a debate that followed his statement</a> updating colleagues on Brexit planning so far.<br></p> <p>But a senior Downing Street official sought to distance Theresa May from the statement. \u201cHe is setting out his view that [single market membership] is improbable,\u201d the spokeswoman told journalists, adding that the work on the negotiations was ongoing. \u201cThe prime minister recognises that people have differing views and \u2026 all of this has to be negotiated with European partners. The prime minister\u2019s view is that we should be ambitious and go after the best deal we can.

A policy tends to be a direction of travel: saying something is probable or improbable is not policy.\u201d</p> <p>The spokeswoman also addressed reports that the government is planning to demand a system under which EU citizens coming to the UK must have a job offer. \u201cI\u2019d point you to what the prime minister has said,\u201d she said, highlighting May\u2019s view that the referendum result was a \u201cclear message\u201d that British people wanted to be able to control EU migration. \u201cBut there are various ways you can do that and it is something the government is looking at and will come forward with proposals.\u201d</p> <p>She would not confirm the reports, saying the government had yet to set out any of the options it was looking at, and insisting that it was \u201cnot always the right approach to put all your cards on the table at the start\u201d.</p> <p>She said: \u201cThere are range of ways in which you might seek to bring in controls. I didn\u2019t see or hear the prime minister pointing to one particular system, what you\u2019ve seen is her talking about a [points-based immigration] system that she <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/05/no-10-theresa-may-rules-out-points-based-immigration-system-for-britain-brexit\">doesn\u2019t think will work</a>.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Switzerland has blinked first in a standoff with the EU that mirrors the UK\u2019s Brexit debate on the critical trade-off between free movement and a special trade deal with the bloc.</p> <p>The Alpine republic voted narrowly to impose EU immigration quotas in a 2014 referendum that must be implemented by next February, but Brussels has said any cap would deny Switzerland its privileged access to the single market.</p> <p>With talks between Bern and the EU commission due to resume on 19 September, Swiss ministers have welcomed a parliamentary panel\u2019s plan to give preference to local people in job hires rather than impose unilateral quotas on foreigners.</p> <p>It is not yet clear that the compromise, which must be debated by the full parliament, will win EU approval. But it represents at least a potential way out of the corner into which Switzerland has painted itself.</p> <p>Any \u201cmajor concession\u201d by the EU, which has not budged from its stance that Switzerland must respect free movement rules or lose trade benefits, was plainly \u201cunrealistic\u201d following Britain\u2019s exit vote, the justice minister Simonetta Sommaruga told the Neue Z\u00fcrcher Zeitung. </p> <p>Both Swiss and EU officials had previously said the UK referendum result had \u201ccomplicated\u201d the talks between the two sides, since any EU compromise with Switzerland would be almost certain to fuel similar demands from Britain. </p> <p>All main political parties have supported the proposal, with the exception of the rightwing Swiss People\u2019s party, which denounced it as a betrayal of voters who backed annual limits on foreigners\u2019 residency and working rights.</p> <p>Sommaruga said she believed a bill that encouraged Swiss employers to \u201cfill open jobs first of all with suitable workers from Switzerland\u201d could reduce immigration and comply with EU freedom of movement rules.</p> <p>The economy minister and Swiss confederation president, Johann Schneider-Ammann, who will meet the EU commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker in Zurich later this month, said the plan could allow the government to \u201cmeet its constitutional obligation to manage immigration, without violating its EU agreements\u201d. </p> <p>Switzerland\u2019s relations with the EU are governed by a set of multiple bilateral treaties that give it privileged access to much of the single market and are linked by a \u201cguillotine clause\u201d \u2013 if one treaty is breached, they all collapse. </p> <p>Neither side wants that to happen: the EU takes more Swiss exports than any other market, and Switzerland is the EU\u2019s fourth-largest trading partner. About 1 million EU citizens currently live in Switzerland.</p> <p>But in a vote with a striking resemblance to Britain\u2019s, the populist, Eurosceptic SVP called for and, against all establishment expectations, won the 2014 referendum, with 50.3% of voters \u2013 in a country whose population is almost one-quarter foreign \u2013 demanding immigration quotas.</p> <p>As a result, the country not only finds itself threatened with exclusion from the EU\u2019s single market, with potentially dramatic economic consequences, but has already been ejected from the EU\u2019s science research programme, Horizon2020, and the Erasmus student exchange programme. </p> <p>It has one further possible solution to its dilemma. A petition calling for a second referendum that would allow voters to make an explicit choice between imposing immigration controls on EU citizens and maintaining Switzerland\u2019s special trade deal with the bloc has gathered enough signatures to trigger a new plebiscite.</p> <p> The draft legislation unveiled late last week would \u201cseverely reduce\u201d the attractiveness of hiring people from abroad, the parliamentary committee said, by favouring people \u2013 including EU citizens \u2013 already living in Switzerland.</p> <p>If parliament and the EU do not approve it, the government is obliged to call a second referendum \u2013 the consequences of which would, this time, be rather clearer. It would be watched with interest in Britain. </p>",

  "<h2>The lawyer: \u2018Helen\u2019s barrister is not making a very good job of it\u2019</h2> <p>Rob Titchener is weeping in court. \u201cI just wanted her to get better so we could be a family and she still did this to me. Why, Helen? All I ever did was love you. Was that so very wrong?\u201d What a performance. Let\u2019s hope the jury can see through it \u2013 or are Archers fans. If they have been listening to the Radio 4 drama over the past year, they will be well aware why Helen stabbed Rob one night at Blossom Hill cottage, leaving him close to death in a pool of his own blood on the kitchen floor. Ever since they got married last summer, Rob has been systematically abusing Helen psychologically, physically and sexually. But now <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/sep/04/the-archers-call-to-help-domestic-abuse-victims-as-titchener-trial-starts\">she is the one up for attempted murder</a>, and he is playing the victim.<br></p> <p>And on the performance so far of Helen\u2019s barrister, Anna Tregorran, it is not looking good for her. \u201cShe\u2019s not making a very good job of it,\u201d says Jeannie Mackie, criminal barrister at Doughty Street Chambers. \u201cI don\u2019t know if [the writers] are making her deliberately bad and making her psychological state a subplot, or whether they haven\u2019t written it in a way that is realistic, legally.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cfbc3863d8f490da562d4ecd7fb82149a03bd9a9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cfbc3863d8f490da562d4ecd7fb82149a03bd9a9/0_232_2860_1714/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Louiza Patikas, who plays Helen Archer and Timothy Watson (Rob Titchener).\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018It\u2019s not looking good for Helen\u2019: Louiza Patikas, who plays Helen Titchener and Timothy Watson (Rob Titchener).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pete Dadds/BBC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The cross-examination of Rob is Tregorran\u2019s most important job. \u201cBy the end of it, the jury should be thinking: \u2018We\u2019re really not sure about this person, we don\u2019t really believe him, he isn\u2019t being truthful.\u2019 But she hasn\u2019t established any facts or any allegations against him.\u201d</p> <p>Rob, who was severely injured but gradually recovered, limped into court using a walking stick, which was a surprise to Helen\u2019s father and brother in the gallery. \u201cOne of the questions I would have asked would be: \u2018When you do the coaching for the cricket team, do you use a stick? Or, \u2018When you were interviewed for your new job, did you go in with a stick?\u2019\u201d says Mackie. That\u2019s the sort of information Tregorran should have been furnished with, mainly by a solicitor, but she could have picked up snippets of information about him in Ambridge, where she is staying with her mother.</p> <p>\u201cIf Anna could have established early on that he was a liar about the degree of his incapacity, then that puts into doubt everything he says after that. This stick business was a complete gift for the defence, and she didn\u2019t appear to notice.\u201d</p> <p>To be fair, says Mackie, it doesn\u2019t sound as if the cross-examination has finished (the trial lasts all week). There is an art to it \u2013 imagine cross-examination as if it\u2019s a box. \u201cOne question builds one wall, the next builds another wall and, finally, you\u2019ve got the person boxed in and there\u2019s no way out.\u201d She didn\u2019t do any preparatory cross-examination, says Mackie, but just went straight in and told him he was a bully. \u201cShe didn\u2019t really put any facts to him.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>One of the awful things that happens to women who are victims of abuse is they blame themselves</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Tregorran has experience prosecuting abusive men, so \u201cshe knows what he\u2019s like, she knows the type of man he is, she has professional and possibly personal experience of men of that character, but she doesn\u2019t appear to have worked out the way of dealing with that kind of person. She let him rant on, when one of the main skills of the cross-examiner is to control a witness, so they don\u2019t have the opportunity to rant on.\u201d</p> <p>Helen hasn\u2019t been the most cooperative client and hasn\u2019t given her barrister a great deal to go on. This isn\u2019t unusual in a case of abuse, says Mackie. \u201cOne of the awful things that happens to women who are victims of abuse is they blame themselves, and Rob and people like him play into that. Helen will be feeling very ashamed \u2013 of having been raped, of having being struck, of having been frightened. Those things are terribly difficult for anyone to admit to, particularly somebody who has had their confidence reduced. Rob has systematically dismantled her as an independent woman and she is finding it difficult to disclose everything she has to. Probably because she doesn\u2019t believe it as well.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/sep/03/archers-helen-titchener-trial-courtroom-artist-julia-quenzler-sketches\">Renowned courtroom artist draws Helen Titchener\u2019s trial for the Archers</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But her barrister should have, at an early stage, had a psychological assessment done for Helen. \u201cThere are psychologists who are very experienced in what we used to call battered women\u2019s syndrome. Anna should have got some ammunition for herself so that then she could explain things.\u201d In the prosecution\u2019s opening statement, there was already mention of how Helen didn\u2019t call an ambulance for her husband, and she will almost certainly be cross-examined \u201con the basis she was completely callous and intended him to die. A psychologist\u2019s report could explain that was the normal reaction of a woman whose child had been threatened and her primary aim was to protect the child. But Anna hasn\u2019t got the information.\u201d</p> <p>How will the jury react over the course of the week? It\u2019s impossible to say, says Mackie. \u201cThere is a theory that juries are harder on women, but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s right,\u201d she says. \u201cIf Helen comes over as sympathetic and truthful \u2026 I don\u2019t think juries get things wrong very often.\u201d But a huge amount depends on her barrister\u2019s performance. \u201cIf she carries on as she is, I\u2019m frightened for Helen,\u201d says Mackie. Most barristers would do a far better job, and it has been irritating to listen to it as a lawyer, but one of the most cathartic things, she says, \u201cis shouting at the radio\u201d. <strong>ES</strong></p> <h2>The counsellor: \u2018I wish they hadn\u2019t made Helen stab Rob\u2019</h2> <p>Like everyone else I have been shouting at the radio. I think [the writers] have handled it very well, but I wish they hadn\u2019t made Helen stab Rob, because incidences of female victims being violent are very rare. I have worked with thousands of women and there have only been a couple of times when one has hit back or thrown something. The plot started off extremely slowly, and coercive control does not start suddenly \u2013 it is a slow, drip effect, so subtle you can\u2019t put your finger on what is happening. It\u2019s only with hindsight you see what has been building.<br></p> <p>Rob charmed the people around Helen, and isolated her \u2013 making it seem that everything was down to Helen\u2019s hormones and state of mind. There is often a wily manipulativeness at play \u2013 you see it with the way perpetrators interact with social services. They come across as perfect, concerned fathers and draw people in. Many women who come to our groups will say it is the only place they have been where \u201cpeople have believed me, or didn\u2019t think I was insane\u201d.</p> <p>Helen began to believe Rob herself, which I absolutely see with survivors. The women talk about how they felt they were going mad, even after the abuser had gone. Many of the women who come to my group have escaped abuse years ago, but are still recovering because coercive control causes so much damage. Survivors have to rebuild the trust in themselves, and in their own minds. Self-blame and self-doubt is one of the hardest things to overcome. And a lack of trust in others can also take time to rebuild.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/sep/05/the-archers-storyline-have-you-been-affected-by-domestic-violence\">The Archers storyline: Have you been affected by domestic violence?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I often see cases where the children are either in the care of the abuser \u2013 as with Helen\u2019s son Henry \u2013 or the abuser is allowed unsupervised contact. The victim often has to jump through hoops to prove she is protecting the children, while everyone seems to forget they are only at risk because the perpetrator is abusive.

Some women are stopped from working, or going to college. Others aren\u2019t allowed to go to a doctor\u2019s appointment alone. I used to do crisis work with women at high risk and sometimes it would be hard to speak to a victim because the abuser would always answer the phone, monitor their calls and check their texts.</p> <p>The storyline where Helen cooks Rob tuna, which he doesn\u2019t like, chimes with the women I have seen. Some women would get into trouble for making tea incorrectly \u2013 the way the abuser liked it made would change every time they made it. The pettiness is a way of showing how he has complete control.</p> <p>One thing that frightened me was when Helen told Rob she wanted to leave. That is the most dangerous time for women, and when they are most likely to get killed. If I was working with a woman before she had left, I would make it clear that would not be safe or advisable thing to do.

If the jury find her guilty of attempting to kill her husband, she will return to prison, and it is likely she would serve at least six years. Whatever happens, in one sense, she will have been lucky. The obvious site for her incarceration, HM Prison Eastwood Park, midway between Gloucester and Bristol, is in easy travelling distance of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/apr/03/ambridge-a-bit-too-eastenders\">Ambridge</a>. Most women sent to jail finish up many miles from friends and family. And Eastwood Park, where she will have been since her arrest, has a mother and baby unit, one of the six women\u2019s jails in England to cater for women giving birth. (There are no women\u2019s prisons in Wales.)<br></p> <p>Eastwood Park is high security, cellular accommodation, surrounded by high, razor-wire-topped fences. It holds up to 360 prisoners, on remand and convicted, some serving long sentences. Each room in its mother and baby unit is self-contained and left unlocked at night. There is a TV lounge with comfortable sofas, a nursery and a sand pit with tiny chairs and tables.</p> <p>Helen will probably know by now that she is in a minority of women in prison of women prisoners in facing a long sentence \u2013 around half serve less than three months.

Some 52% of women in prison reported having used heroin, crack or cocaine in the weeks before they entered custody (not much of that in Ambridge, I\u2019d imagine).</p> <p>She will have found sympathy; women in jail tend to look after each other better than their male counterparts. And she is literate, so will have been in demand as a letter writer and form filler. Many <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/nov/24/reduce-number-women-prison\">women in prison</a> are poorly educated. Foreign nationals, many not speaking English, account for some 12% of the female prison population, and represent 81 different nationalities. Again, a long way from life in Ambridge.</p> <p>Confinement apart, she may have chosen to keep herself busy. The prison offers a wide variety of educational and vocational courses, including cookery and salon services, along with drug and alcohol awareness. If she wanted to keep fit, she could have attended the gym or joined the \u201cearly morning walking club\u201d \u2013 a first for prisons, as far as I know, although the rambling will certainly not have extended beyond the forbidding fences.</p> <p>Although women make up for around 5% of the prison population, they account for more than a quarter of all incidents of self-harm in jails. In the past year, 12 women prisoners have apparently taken their own lives in jails in England. If convicted, Helen will be allowed to keep her child with her until he is 18 months old \u2013 although they may be separated sooner, if it is thought the prison environment is damaging the child psychologically.</p> <p>If she is lucky, family members other than her abusive husband will then take care of her children while Helen carries on with her jail term. Of the two babies born in English prisons each week, many are taken into care, or placed in foster homes. Imagine the effect of that on the still-incarcerated mums. <strong>EA</strong></p>",

Everything about reforming turns me off, apart from travelling around in a bus with some old friends.</p></div> </div> </div>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57ceb20ae4b0456abb93dcd0\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-06T12:10:12.678Z\">1.10pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/16669041\">costacommie</a> asks:</p> <p>What\u2019s it like being a record player-player?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-comment\" data-canonical-url=\"https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/82674975\">  <div class=\"d2-comment-embedded\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Comment\"> <div class=\"d2-left-col\"> <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/16678702\" title=\"View NormanCook\u2019s profile\"> <img class=\"d2-avatar\" src=\"https://avatar.guim.co.uk/user/16678702\" height=\"40\" width=\"40\" alt=\"User avatar for NormanCook\"> </a> <span class=\"d2-badge d2-badge-contributor d2-hidetext\" title=\"Guardian contributor\" itemprop=\"jobTitle\">Guardian contributor</span> </div> <div class=\"d2-right-col\"> <div itemscope itemprop=\"author\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"> <a class=\"d2-username\" href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/16678702\" title=\"View NormanCook\u2019s profile\" itemprop=\"url\"> <span itemprop=\"givenName\">NormanCook</span> </a> </div> <div class=\"d2-permalink\"> <a class=\"d2-datetime\" href=\"https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/82674975\" title=\"Link to this comment\" itemprop=\"datePublished\">06 September 2016 1:03pm</a> </div> <div class=\"d2-body\" itemprop=\"text\"><p>Great fun, but being a file-filer gives you more freedom.</p></div> </div> </div>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57ceb1d3e4b01f3b27891a9f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-06T12:09:23.706Z\">1.09pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/11752720\">read90apr</a> asks:</p> <p>What would your advice be to producers/DJ\u2019s who have to juggle music production/playing with normal day jobs who are trying to break into the industry?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-comment\" data-canonical-url=\"https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/82674924\">  <div class=\"d2-comment-embedded\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Comment\"> <div class=\"d2-left-col\"> <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/16678702\" title=\"View NormanCook\u2019s profile\"> <img class=\"d2-avatar\" src=\"https://avatar.guim.co.uk/user/16678702\" height=\"40\" width=\"40\" alt=\"User avatar for NormanCook\"> </a> <span class=\"d2-badge d2-badge-contributor d2-hidetext\" title=\"Guardian contributor\" itemprop=\"jobTitle\">Guardian contributor</span> </div> <div class=\"d2-right-col\"> <div itemscope itemprop=\"author\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"> <a class=\"d2-username\" href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/16678702\" title=\"View NormanCook\u2019s profile\" itemprop=\"url\"> <span itemprop=\"givenName\">NormanCook</span> </a> </div> <div class=\"d2-permalink\"> <a class=\"d2-datetime\" href=\"https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/82674924\" title=\"Link to this comment\" itemprop=\"datePublished\">06 September 2016 1:03pm</a> </div> <div class=\"d2-body\" itemprop=\"text\"><p>Don't quit your day job yet.

Likewise <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2006/jun/10/1\">Robert Aldrich</a>, one of the most prominent and successful directors of the period, and Siegel-protege <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/mar/30/bloody-sam-peckinpah-wasted-insane-wild-bunch\">Sam Peckinpah</a>, who went from Hollywood pariah to household name and back in the last decade of his career. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2006/mar/28/guardianobituaries.usa\">Richard Fleischer</a> (Majestyk) and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/apr/10/sidney-lumet-obituary\">Sidney Lumet</a> (The Anderson Tapes, Serpico) made occasional forays into the intelligent thriller genre between very different kinds of other movies, while younger journeymen like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/feb/04/rolling-thunder-john-flynn-dvd\">John Flynn</a> (The Outfit, Rolling Thunder), <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2001/apr/19/guardianobituaries.filmnews\">Michael Ritchie</a> (Prime Cut) and Joseph Sargent (The Taking of Pelham One Two Three) staked honourable places at the top table.</p> <p>By and large these actors and these directors (and inevitably in this era, we are talking about men) had done their fair share of living: some had seen the worst of the Depression and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/secondworldwar\">second world war</a>, or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/shortcuts/2013/jul/24/korean-war-british-memories-forgotten-conflict\">Korea</a>; many came up the hard way from poor backgrounds and raw experiences; and that knowledge was deeply etched in the actors\u2019 faces and performances and in the directors\u2019 ways of shaping their stories. </p> <p>To put it no higher: Chris Pine, a very good actor, lacks that depth and sense of hinterland.

As the historian Rick Perlstein has noted, these were the years when the introspection and self-critical attitudes cultivated on the fringes in the 60s went mainstream and suburban. America, and Hollywood as well, went through the greatest sustained period of intense, 360-degree national self-scrutiny in their history. Just as every institution in the polity was examined for flaws and weak spots, so were genres in Hollywood, because they too were American institutions badly in need of a dose of revisionism.

Recently <a href=\"http://news.scotland.gov.uk/News/Eradicating-child-poverty-2738.aspx\">appointed for another year as the Scottish government\u2019s independent adviser on poverty and inequality</a>, the 66-year-old who has been at the forefront of some of the most successful and influential social policies of the past few decades is well aware of the balancing act demanded of her position.</p> <p>But Eisenstadt, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2011/oct/19/evolution-of-sure-start-success\">the first director of the Labour government\u2019s Sure Start Unit</a>, also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2009/oct/14/naomi-eisenstadt-social-exclusion-priority\">former director of the Social Exclusion Task Force</a>, is a cheerful pragmatist. The key lesson she brings with her from those previous roles is: \u201cBasically, work with the grain of what they\u2019re trying to do and help them do it, if you believe what they\u2019re trying to do is right.\u201d</p> <p>Her influence was most immediately seen at last autumn\u2019s SNP conference, when Nicola Sturgeon refocused the party\u2019s childcare policy on to improving the number of qualified nursery staff in poor areas after Eisenstadt made clear her concerns that Sturgeon\u2019s government had been upping the ante on childcare hours without addressing the question of quality. (Managing the tension between flexibility, quality and affordability remains \u201calmost impossible\u201d, she warns now.)</p> <p>The reasons for the difference between Scotland and the rest of the UK on welfare and poverty reduction may be self-evident at government level but, says Eisenstadt, \u201cit\u2019s very difficult to figure out why it\u2019s so different, and of course it has become more divergent since the 2015 [Westminster] election and is more extreme now.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There's nothing better if you are worried about poverty than giving people money</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cOn the child poverty story, it goes back to Iain Duncan Smith, who I think was serious, and did really care, but he encouraged a narrative that is about the behaviours rather than economic circumstance. So when he talks about wanting to work on the root causes of poverty, it seems to me the root cause is not having enough money. As soon as you take that away from the definition of poverty it becomes much more about government trying to change the behaviours of adults. So the measurement is: Do you have a job? Are you married? So it\u2019s all about individual behaviour, not about a systemic approach to the economics of poverty.\u201d</p> <p>According to Eisenstadt, that divergence has reached its zenith (for now) with the redrafting of child poverty legislation for the UK, followed by the Scottish government <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/jul/20/scotland-bring-back-scrapped-targets-child-poverty-nicola-sturgeon-consultation-bill-strategy\">this summer announcing plans to bring forward Scotland\u2019s first-ever child poverty bill</a>, in a move that could allow the reintroduction of those abandoned statutory targets. <br></p> <p>With Holyrood\u2019s new parliamentary session having started this week, there\u2019s an expectation of even further divergence. Sturgeon on Tuesday described the child poverty bill as \u201carguably the most important piece of legislation\u201d that her government will bring forward this year. But the Scottish government will also begin the process of shaping the country\u2019s first social security system, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/mar/01/scottish-government-to-set-up-benefits-agency-to-streamline-welfare\">using devolved welfare powers</a> agreed under the Scotland Act.</p> <p>In Eisenstadt\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.gov.scot/Publications/2016/01/1984\">first report, published earlier in the year</a>, she urged the Scottish government to \u201cproceed with caution\u201d on the new welfare powers: what did she mean?</p> <p>\u201cThere is a fundamental tension to be managed between a transparent, simple system and what families lives are like. People argue for universal because it\u2019s simple and cheap. People argue for targeted, but then you need to figure out how.\u201d</p> <p>The new welfare powers will account for around \u00a32.7bn or 15% of the total Scottish benefits bill, with the rest still controlled by Westminster. The SNP government has already committed in its manifesto to increasing carer\u2019s allowance to the level of jobseeker\u2019s allowance, and replacing the Sure Start maternity grant with an expanded maternity and early years allowance called the <a href=\"https://consult.scotland.gov.uk/social-security/social-security-in-scotland/consultation/subpage.2016-06-26.6050226460/\">Best Start grant</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/04/nicola-sturgeon-speaks-about-miscarriage-at-40\">Nicola Sturgeon speaks about her miscarriage at 40</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Eisenstadt gives this an immediate thumbs up: \u201cThere\u2019s nothing better if you\u2019re worried about poverty than giving people money. We know that these are pinch times in people\u2019s lives and a dollop of cash makes a difference.\u201d</p> <p>Likewise, she says that she regrets not emphasising in her first report that Scotland will not gain any powers over sanctions: \u201cI kept hearing horrendous stories about sanctions and we\u2019re not getting any powers [on them].\u201d</p> <p>As her work gathers pace for another parliamentary year, two areas demand her attention: \u201cThere are two things that really jump out. One is the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/jun/10/glasgow-effect-die-young-high-risk-premature-death\">Glasgow health stuff</a>, which of course has been talked about for years and years. The other one is rural poverty.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI was up in Shetland for their Fairness Commission and in Lerwick they blame everything on Edinburgh, not Westminster. There is a real issue because the numbers are small, because it\u2019s sparse populations, but the cost of living is much higher. It\u2019s difficult to know how you manage that. Repopulation would help because you do need a critical mass, for example, for a good health service.\u201d</p> <p>On the day that we meet, Sturgeon is making further gloomy pronouncements about the economic consequences of Brexit for Scotland. There is great willingness to be ambitious about poverty, says Eisenstadt, but the money simply isn\u2019t there.</p> <p>\u201cIt really is robbing Peter to pay Paul and it\u2019s how you do it in the fairest way. Brexit was a shock, no question.\u201d</p> <p>Meanwhile, she acknowledges that the currently toxic relationship between local and central government \u2013 not helped by the lengthy council-tax freeze and further spending cuts \u2013 could be improved. \u201cThere\u2019s so much more that we agree on than disagree on, particularly between Labour-run authorities and the SNP, but the nature of the relationships are difficult and we need to rise above that.\u201d</p>",

Music is at the heart of it, and political engagement, and it\u2019s a play from the birth of democracy, and Edinburgh is the Athens of the north \u2026 it was the obvious choice.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f7f687155369b4a0ee4363d1bc65526e43507c31\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f7f687155369b4a0ee4363d1bc65526e43507c31/0_123_5616_3370/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Neve Macintosh and Rudi Dharmalingham in The Events, David Greig\u2019s previous collaboration with Ramin Gray and John Browne.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Neve Macintosh and Rudi Dharmalingham in The Events, David Greig\u2019s previous collaboration with Ramin Gray and John Browne.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo Macleod/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Talking alongside his collaborators on a breezy Edinburgh morning, just as rehearsals are beginning in earnest, it is clear that Greig also wanted to call on their triumvirate energy, previously used to great effect in The Events, about the aftermath of a gun massacre. \u201cThere\u2019s something about the way we work as a group of three that\u2019s more than rigorous, that\u2019s about pushing as hard as you can possibly push. And for an opening show it would have a vulnerability to it. There\u2019s no point doing an opening show that you know everyone\u2019s going to like: it had to feel like a worthy risk.\u201d</p> <p>Irish composer Browne chips in: \u201cThe common feature [of how we work together] is dramaturgical. The three of us have that drive, and here the story is the smallest part of this piece, while the context is massive. It\u2019s a very simple story that can be told and absorbed in a single sentence, but thematically and politically it\u2019s very complex.\u201d<br></p> <p>Gray, currently the artistic director of <a href=\"http://www.atctheatre.com/\">Actors Touring Company</a>, adds: \u201cThere are all sorts of assumptions people make because of the way the technology of theatre has evolved over the past 2,500 years, but [this work] is about poetry, music, dancing, philosophy, politics, ritual \u2026\u201d<br></p> <p>Drawing these strands together is a chorus of non-professional local young women, representing the suppliants of the title. In ancient Greece, the theatrical chorus was like a finishing school for young men, Gray explains. It was, says Browne, \u201con the cusp between a religious ceremony and public entertainment and political debate\u201d.</p> <p>But in modern day Edinburgh, as well as Belfast and Newcastle, The Suppliant Women will also be performed by local choruses, the cities represented on stage by 50 volunteers, aged between 16 and 30, whose voices will carry the performance. \u201cThere are 55 pages of just chorus!\u201d Gray exclaims, as the young women, who are learning their lines by rote around a piano rather than from a script, plead for sanctuary. \u201cBut we haven\u2019t told them that yet \u2026\u201d he adds jauntily.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5f7f8275009fe056ee0ca10af0206b7ff8a6fa82\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5f7f8275009fe056ee0ca10af0206b7ff8a6fa82/0_238_4256_2554/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ramin Gray, centre, in rehearsals for The Suppliant Women.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ramin Gray, centre, in rehearsals for The Suppliant Women.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alan McCredie</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Greig\u2019s version is written in rhythm, and Browne says that he has stuck as closely as possible to the inverse and anti-verse choral device used by Aeschylus. \u201cWith the chorus, its about getting dynamic through antithesis, for example between war and justice. We\u2019ve just allowed 50 refugee women in, but the worry is that this may lead to war in our city. The debate at the heart of the play is the current debate.\u201d</p> <p>Gray adds: \u201cIt can be helpful when you have a very contemporary and pressing issue to look at it through a 2,500-year-old lens. It enables you to look at it in a more abstract way.\u201d</p> <p>Greig pre-empts the charge that his adaption has shoe-horned in its current politics: \u201cThere will be people who say, \u2018Well they\u2019ve made this all about asylum seekers, and that line about Syria has obviously been placed\u2019, and the frustrating thing is that all that stuff is already there \u2013 it isn\u2019t imposed by us.\u201d</p> <p>Gray interjects with delight: \u201cIn the fourth line in Aeschylus, Syria is name-checked!\u201d</p> <p>For Greig, the usefulness to a contemporary audience is obvious: \u201cWe\u2019re not watching propaganda and we\u2019re not watching op-ed pieces; we\u2019re watching stories and performances that require us to engage with each other. This play is primal, it\u2019s the very beginning of what drama is, it\u2019s a play from a year before democracy was invented in Athens.\u201d (The original text also contains the first ever recorded use of the word democracy, and a public vote \u2013 on whether the women should be allowed to stay \u2013 is a key plot point.)</p> <p>\u201cTo have theatre and democracy linked like that, I think is a really important and profound statement about what the role and purpose of theatre is.\u201d</p> <ul> <li>The Suppliant Women, a co-production between Actors Touring Company and the Lyceum, is at <a href=\"http://lyceum.org.uk/whats-on/production/the-suppliant-women\">Edinburgh Lyceum</a> from 1-15 October; <a href=\"http://belfastinternationalartsfestival.com/\">Belfast international arts festival</a>, 21-22 October; and <a href=\"http://www.northernstage.co.uk/\">Northern Stage</a>, Newcastle, 3-5 November.<br></li> </ul>",

There will inevitably have been a sharp fall in numbers completing courses this year.</p> <p>It is of little comfort to employers that the drop in course enrolments has been broadly in line with trends across higher education, consequent upon steep increases in tuition fees in 2012.</p> <p>Despite the publicity they have generated, the emergence of <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/social-care-network/2015/oct/13/careers-care-training-route\">fast-track training courses</a> like Step Up to Social Work, Frontline and Think Ahead also provide meagre reassurance when the bigger picture is so worrying.</p> <p>On the ground, new holes opening up in social work teams are remaining unfilled. According to <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.nmds-sc-online.org.uk/Get.aspx?id=957463\" rel=\"nofollow\">analysis by Skills for Care</a> (pdf), the skills agency for adult social care, vacancy rates in the sector shot up by four percentage points in 2014 to 12% last year. Annual turnover, on a three-year rising trend, registered a one-point increase to 13%.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/503071/SFR07_2016_Main_Text.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">According to the Department for Education</a> (pdf), turnover in children\u2019s social work was 16% last year and there was an \u201cunexpected\u201d rise of more than a quarter in vacancy rates, taking them to 17% \u2013 but this England-wide figure disguises sharp regional variations, ranging from 7% in Yorkshire and Humber to 29% in outer London.</p> <p>Good news, then, for agencies that supply temporary staff: in adult care, an average 7% of jobs were filled through agencies last year, compared with 3% in 2013, while in children\u2019s services the proportion rose by one percentage point to an average 16%, almost 5,000 posts, and as high as 30% in outer London.</p> <p>Employers are responding with a range of initiatives to attract and retain permanent staff, including so-called \u201cgolden hello\u201d payments for signing up and \u201cgolden handcuffs\u201d for staying \u2013 as much as \u00a315,000 for those <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/social-care-network/2016/mar/15/social-work-recruitment-councils-bidding-war\">remaining in post for three years</a> in one case.</p> <p>Not for the first time, some councils are resorting to recruitment overseas. Wokingham, in Berkshire, had a 26% vacancy rate for children\u2019s social workers earlier this year. It <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.communitycare.co.uk/2016/05/13/council-cheaper-recruit-social-workers-australia-pay-agency-fees/\" rel=\"nofollow\">found five recruits in Western Australia</a>, an area targeted because it is said to have a similar legal and educational framework to England\u2019s.</p> <p>But for Allen, these expedients are no real solution. She argues that as well as proper workforce planning, answers lie in making social work a more attractive job.</p> <p>It\u2019s no coincidence, Allen suspects, that the number of social workers choosing to be self-employed \u2013 whether through agencies or as independent practitioners \u2013 is growing. More than 4,000 BASW members, almost one in four, are registered as independents. Having control and being able to walk away from impossible caseloads or oppressive office environments is an attractive prospect.</p> <p>Last year\u2019s Guardian Jobs survey of social workers, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/dec/08/social-workers-survey-not-child-snatchers-love-jobs-leave-sector\">Social Lives</a>, pointed to rising frustration at working conditions such as hotdesking, with 67% saying they had been affected by stress or depression and more than 80% voicing concern for their wellbeing.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the looming issue of the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/social-care-network/social-life-blog/2016/feb/17/social-work-bursary-students\">future of the social work bursary</a> could have a critical impact on the profession\u2019s capacity to refresh its ranks and meet the growing demands it faces.</p> <p>Ministers are expected to launch a delayed consultation on bursaries shortly, following the scrapping of provision for other professions like nursing. At present, 4,000 bursaries are available annually for postgraduate social work students, and undergraduates in their second and third years, costing \u00a370m in total.</p> <p>In a recent letter to Jeremy Hunt, Allen warned that the uncertainty \u201cdoes nothing to reassure social work students or academics that they are valued by government\u201d. She fears that abolishing the payments would deal a further, devastating blow to numbers entering the profession and to the diversity of its workforce.</p> <p>Allen adds that while there are examples of council employers responding to the message, many are not. </p> <p>\u201cThis is a specialist care profession, by far the biggest registered profession they [councils] employ,\u201d she says. \u201cThey have to realise they need to provide an environment in which people feel valued, feel they have a career pathway and want to stay.\u201d</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/social-care/\">Join the Social Care Network</a> to read more pieces like this.

  "<p> \u201cLeaving the refugees unprotected means you leave your country and society unprotected, and we have to do something,\u201d says Efi Latsoudi, a Lesbos resident who\u2019s seen her hometown engulfed by the worst humanitarian crisis of our time. </p> <p>Originally from Athens, the 48-year-old human rights activist moved to the Greek island in 2001, and for the past four years has been one of the founders and administrators of an open, self-organised refugee camp, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pikpalesvos/about/?entry_point=page_nav_about_item&amp;tab=page_info\">Pikpa</a>. The camp has been run, through all the tumult of the last few years, entirely on the efforts of volunteers and donations. </p> <p>Pikpa, on the south-east corner of the island, grew out of a solidarity network of local NGOs and volunteers, and started sheltering refugees in 2012. Though the Greeks have been hit by their own economic crisis for eight years, many such as Latsoudi have re-focused their worries on alleviating the urgent needs of refugees. </p> <p>Latsoudi\u2019s response to the refugee crisis was partly political. \u201cWe had refugees starting to arrive on the island in August 2012. I thought that if we don\u2019t do something for these people, we are giving an advantage to the<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/21/neo-fascist-greek-party-election-golden-dawn-third-place\"> fascist party to raise their power</a>,\u201d Latsoudi says. She felt the neo-fascist party, Golden Dawn, would use the refugee crisis to instil fear and discrimination among Greeks. <br></p> <p>\u201cWe know people get afraid but we have to work on this. This is the important thing, we can\u2019t say this fear does not exist \u2013 of course society, and the volunteers and the refugees were affected by this crisis. But we wanted to create an open, self-organised camp that the local society will participate in, and the refugees will not be detained, but will be recognised in a human way.\u201d </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7ba898dfa8d7fcaa3dbbe3b6874b62bc15d90ae4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7ba898dfa8d7fcaa3dbbe3b6874b62bc15d90ae4/0_92_4252_2552/1000.jpg\" alt=\"life jackets on beach and dingy in sea\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Migrants arriving on Lesbos after crossing the Aegean from Turkey.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Angelos Tzortzinis/AFP/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As the number of refugees on the island increased, Latsoudi and other volunteers occupied an old children\u2019s summer camp near Mytilene airport. Initially, the camp operated as a hostel, but it has responded to the changing nature of the refugee crisis, and temporary shelter has become permanent. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We believe the solidarity of people can be part of the solution. And this is a great thing</p> <footer> <cite>Efi Latsoudi</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t imagine this [reaching this point]. But I think if you\u2019re in this refugee solidarity work, you have to be prepared for anything. Because it\u2019s not an organised trip to Europe, there\u2019s always a situation of crisis that can change any minute.\u201d</p> <p>For Latsoudi, the unity of Greek people and refugees is vital, especially on an island which has a very personal history of migration. Approximately 60% of the 90,000 or so residents in Lesbos are descended from Greek Orthodox Christians expelled from Turkey in the 1920s. \u201cCitizens from Greece are doing this even though they are facing an economic crisis \u2013 they are affected by all the uncertainty that it brings to them. But we believe the solidarity of people can be part of the solution. And this is a great thing,\u201d she says.</p> <p>The Pikpa camp offers shelter, activities, food, and medical support for the most vulnerable refugees, and the families of those who have died at sea. What makes this camp different, Latsoudi says, is humane treatment and an \u201cidea of community\u201d. </p> <p>She has taken on a monumental task: at the peak of the crisis, this time last year, Pikpa was hosting 600 refugees a day, despite a capacity of just 150, and distributing more than 2,000 meals each day. Lesbos has welcomed <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://data.unhcr.org/mediterranean/country.php?id=83\">93,600 refugees by sea this year alone</a> \u2013 equal to the island\u2019s own population. Though Latsoudi believes the government response has been poor, the reaction of Greek people has been positive. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d40579b8465f31d7f1f4694a873ce430c4e6569c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d40579b8465f31d7f1f4694a873ce430c4e6569c/0_384_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Winners of UNHCR\u0092s Nansen Award 2016, Konstantinos Mitragas and Efi Latsoudi on the beach with life jackets in background\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Efi Latsoudi and her fellow award-winner, sea captain Konstantinos Mitragas.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gordon Welters/UNHCR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Latsoudi seems to have taken the last few years in her stride. After studying international law at university, she worked in Athens at detention centres for minors. Though nothing could prepare her for the plight of the Syrians, Afghans, Iraqis and other hundreds of desperate people who have passed through Pikpa\u2019s doors, her dedication is unquestionable. <br></p> <p>Latsoudi, along with Konstantinos Mitragas, a sea captain and the <a href=\"http://www.hrt.org.gr/\">Hellenic Rescue Team\u2019s</a> secretary general, have both just been announced as recipients of <a href=\"http://www.unhcr.org/uk/nansen-refugee-award.html\">UNHCR\u2019s Nansen refugee award</a>, a prize running for 61 years, acknowledging the work of humanitarians across the world in helping displaced people.

She feels the volunteers are also victims: \u201cVolunteers are traumatised. It\u2019s really dangerous for the people involved. I believe that\u2019s why that we have to change these policies about refugees, because we [the volunteers] are also traumatised several times by what has happened. But we cannot leave them [refugees] alone.\u201d</p> <p>In the future, Latsoudi hopes the government policy towards refugees will change and there will be a safe passage for those coming across the Mediterranean.

  "<p>With its sailor hats, opened Breton-striped shirts and neckerchiefs intertwined with seafaring trails, Miuccia Prada\u2019s menswear collection was nautically themed. There was something of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/jan/26/fisherman-fashion-menswear-workwear-trend\">hipster fisherman influence</a> on the collection, but there was also a much grander narrative taking place. </p> <p>The grand \u201cwhoosh\u201d of the shipmate epic is felt, and indeed Homer\u2019s Odyssey, Noah\u2019s Ark and Moby Dick were all cited as influences.

  "<p>Donald Trump\u2019s claims that if he loses in November it will be due to a \u201crigged\u201d election have sparked strong bipartisan criticism from election lawyers, donors and a former member of Congress who warn that the Republican candidate\u2019s words are dangerous, fueling doubts about the election\u2019s legitimacy and potentially leading to voter intimidation.</p> <p>As his poll numbers have weakened and his high-decibel spats with critics escalated, Trump has raised the specter of rigged elections and suggested that if he loses it might well be because of voter fraud. </p> <p>\u201cThe only way we can lose, in my opinion, I really mean this, Pennsylvania, is if cheating goes on,\u201d Trump told a largely white rally last month in Altoona, Pennsylvania. \u201cGo down to certain areas and watch and study [to] make sure other people don\u2019t come in and vote five times.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to have unbelievable turnout, but we don\u2019t want to see people voting five times,\u201d Trump added, saying that he had \u201cheard some stories about certain parts of the state and we have to be very careful\u201d.</p> <p>Several election lawyers and analysts are disturbed by Trump\u2019s combustible use of language.</p> <p>\u201cTrump\u2019s rhetoric is troubling and casts a shadow over the legitimacy of the elections,\u201d said Ken Gross, a well-known election lawyer in Washington who represents both Republican and Democratic clients. \u201cTrump\u2019s words may motivate people to go to polling places and potentially intimidate people not to vote.\u201d </p> <p>The idea that \u201celections are rigged and there\u2019s widespread fraud is not backed up by facts\u201d, he said.</p> <p>Others echo these concerns. \u201cTo argue that the process is rigged and prepare people for a supposedly illegitimate outcome is a very dangerous thing,\u201d former Reublican representative Vin Weber told the Guardian. \u201cWhat you want is to have a civil peaceful election [and] you don\u2019t want to disrupt that.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/sep/06/donald-trump-tax-returns-hillary-clinton-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/52vdg\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2696938\"            data-video-name=\"Hillary Clinton: 'Trump clearly has something to hide' in tax returns \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"AP\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57cf3270e4b0bc856be626ee\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/09/06/160906Clinton_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/09/06/160906Clinton.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/09/06/160906Clinton_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/sep/06/donald-trump-tax-returns-hillary-clinton-video\">Hillary Clinton: \u2018Trump clearly has something to hide\u2019 in tax returns</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>One prominent GOP election lawyer says that Trump\u2019s fears are overblown, stressing that the \u201cfar right has been worked up about voter fraud for the last five to 10 years, but there\u2019s little evidence that this type of activity is material. I don\u2019t like it when people talk about issues that haven\u2019t happened yet, or are phantom issues\u201d.</p> <p>Recent studies indicate that voter fraud is not widespread. Only 31 cases of possible in-person voter fraud were found from 2000 to 2014, during which period over 1bn votes were cast in general and primary elections, according to a study by Justin Levitt, a professor at Loyola Law School.</p> <p>Nonetheless, Trump\u2019s ominous warnings seem part of a new campaign mantra. The candidate voiced similar views this summer in an <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/for-trump-a-new-rigged-system-the-election-itself/2016/08/02/d9fb33b0-58c4-11e6-9aee-8075993d73a2_story.html\">interview with The Washington Post</a> and on Fox News with Sean Hannity. </p> <p>Trump complained to the Post that recent court decisions nixing restrictive voter ID laws could well lead to voter fraud, calling this a \u201cvery unfair development. We may have people vote 10 times\u201d. Likewise on Hannity, Trump urged supporters to begin \u201cwatching closely\u201d lest the election be \u201ctaken away from us\u201d.</p> <p>On the campaign trail in Ohio Trump declared: \u201cI\u2019m afraid the election is going to be rigged. I have to be honest.\u201d</p> <p>Moreover, the candidate\u2019s website boasts a section that not only informs supporters how they can be a \u201cvolunteer Trump election observer\u201d, but also echoes Trump\u2019s heated rhetoric about election rigging. Those who sign up to be volunteers receive emails explaining that the campaign intends to do \u201ceverything that we are legally allowed to do to stop crooked Hillary from rigging the election\u201d. The website notes that volunteers would be useful in Ohio and Pennsylvania.</p> <p>There is nothing wrong with Trump talking about training poll watchers as campaigns have long done, stresses Larry Noble, a former general counsel at the Federal Election Commission who now holds the same title at the nonpartisan Campaign Legal Center. \u201cBut if he\u2019s suggesting, as it appears he is, that his supporters should take any actions that would result in intimidation of voters, that\u2019s illegal.\u201d</p> <p>Adds Charlie Black, a veteran GOP operative: \u201cIf it was my campaign, I\u2019d let the lawyers handle any potential voter fraud.\u201d </p> <p>Some conservative groups have echoed Trump\u2019s fears about rigged elections.</p> <p>Right-leaning groups \u2013 including Judicial Watch and True the Vote \u2013 are calling for extra vigilance, and raising money off the issue. Judicial Watch has rolled out an \u201cElection Integrity Project\u201d which warns voters that \u201cthe integrity of our elections is under systematic assault by leftists and politicians whose objective is clearly to manipulate the elections for their own gains\u201d. The project charges that certain states are refusing to clean their voter rolls of the deceased and people who have moved and has filed suits in some states to force them to do so.</p> <p>Outside experts disagree with the premise that there\u2019s a link between voter rolls and voter fraud. \u201cIn-person voter fraud is virtually nonexistent and is a myth that has been used to to justify voter restrictions like photo IDs,\u201d said Gerry Hebert, the executive director of the Campaign Legal Center. </p> <p>And Hebert adds that filing a lawsuit to clean up voter rolls \u201cis not proof of voter fraud\u201d.</p> <p>But Trump allies have continued to stoke fears of fraud. Longtime Trump confidante Roger Stone, who has offered periodic advice during the campaign and publicly raised the specter of a rigged election, told Breitbart News that the government \u201cwill be shut down if they attempt to steal this election and swear Hillary in\u201d.</p> <p>Some GOP operatives poke fun at Trump\u2019s fears of a \u201crigged\u201d election \u2013 especially in Pennsylvania.</p> <p>\u201cTrump\u2019s comments make perfect sense coming from a paranoid narcissist,\u201d quipped Rick Tyler, a former spokesman for Senator Ted Cruz, noting that the GOP \u201chasn\u2019t won Pennsylvania in a presidential election since 1988\u201d.</p> <p>But other critics see graver threats in Trump\u2019s words.</p> <p> \u201cIf people start to believe that elections aren\u2019t legitimate then it could encourage anarchy and despotism,\u201d said Michael Epstein, a GOP donor and fundraiser who initially backed Governor Scott Walker in the primaries. \u201cIf you lose respect for government, anything is possible.\u201d</p>",

A group, calling itself \u201cArmed Gate Niners Urban Guerillas\u201d emerged to claim responsibility, declaring the attacks \u201cthe beginning of an armed fight against rotten, contemporary Cypriot football\u201d.</p> <p>Even now, 18 months later, Skapoullis, a stocky man with sinewy arms and a stern demeanour, winces when talk turns to the attacks. So, too, does Spyros Neofitides, the president of the Pancyprian Footballers Association, who has found himself dealing with death threats against foreign players and in recent weeks has exhorted the local police to clean up the game.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"30431be05430ed2beb0aaba21ef49a6536121387\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/30431be05430ed2beb0aaba21ef49a6536121387/0_0_5616_3546/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Apoel Nicosia fans after the final whistle of the Champions League first leg quarter-final against Real Madrid at the GSP Stadium in 2012\" width=\"1000\" height=\"631\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Apoel Nicosia fans after the final whistle of the Champions League first leg quarter-final against Real Madrid at the GSP Stadium in 2012.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Patrick Baz/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>After all this is Cyprus, the tiny island nation where almost everyone knows everyone and where, like most former British colonies, football is treated with the reverence of a national sport. Violence usually has strayed no further than the odd clash between fans of Apoel and Omonia, the biggest Greek Cypriot clubs whose rivalry dates to the civil war that wracked Greece in the late 1940s. If the men in the middle have never been exactly sacrosanct this sort of treatment is unprecedented.</p> <p>The Cyprus Referees Association lies outside Nicosia, the island\u2019s divided capital, amidst rolling fields of land donated by the state. At certain times of the year, those fields are replete with bundles of perfectly stacked hay. It is an idyllic setting for an institution so integrally connected to a sport with huge social ramifications, beloved by politicians, businessmen and the church.</p> <p>In a country viewed as football crazy, almost no slice of life does not somehow fall within the orbit of the beautiful game. And yet, football had elicited a war, a war that Skapoullis is quick to say remains very much unresolved.</p> <p>\u201cAll these incidents but still nobody has been punished\u201d he sighs, the early evening light throwing shadows across his desk. \u201cIf you are a referee, an elite referee, you worry because you just don\u2019t know when it\u2019s going to be your turn.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/feb/28/cyprus-postpone-matches-bomb-damages-referee-car\">Cyprus FA postpones matches after bomb damages car of top referee</a> </p> </aside>  <p>While the world has been fixated on wrongdoing elsewhere \u2013 with Fifa seeing bribes unearthed, arrests made and a president dethroned in 2015 \u2013 another less publicised drama has been smouldering away in the eastern Mediterranean. And, just as at Fifa, one of Europe\u2019s most enthusiastic football nations has been confronted with some uncomfortable questions: how did Cyprus\u2019s beautiful game come to have one of the worst reputations for match-fixing? How did it come to be blemished by betting syndicates in countries as far away as Malaysia? How did it come to be so corruptible and corrupted?</p> <p>If anyone was under any illusion that professional football here was crime-free, the attacks on the referees and persistent allegations of rigging have ensured that they had to think again.</p> <p>After the blasts came Marios Panayi. When the international referee decided to blow his whistle, he blew it hard. He called press conferences that laid bare the dark inner workings of the game: penalty kicks that should never be awarded; fouls that should never be called; yellow cards that should never be given; players who should never be sent off. He named names, handed over documents and provided evidence in the form of recorded conversations that allegedly exposed the tangled web of corruption underpinning Cyprus\u2019s football league. And he claimed that matches were fixed on the orders of senior officials at the Cyprus Football Association.</p> <p>\u201cI did it hoping they [authorities] wouldn\u2019t close their eyes,\u201d said Panayi, who has since been struck off the Association\u2019s register and forced to depart for Britain. \u201cReferees can use any trick in the book. It can be a minor or major decision depending on the match and whether it is televised or not. Where there aren\u2019t cameras, they can do big things.\u201d</p> <p>The referee\u2019s revelations were a thunderbolt. Sports officials were at a loss: was Panayi courageous or simply crazy? Those who believed he was brave saw in him a man of principle and vigour. Those who believed he was crazy, a man of manipulation and untrammelled ambition.</p> <p>But Panayi also won backing from unexpected quarters. The Belgian-based anti-match fixing organisation, Federbet, praised his courage. So did Nikos Kartakoullis, the erstwhile head of the Cyprus Sports Organisation, the island\u2019s supreme sports authority.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"75d7b2adea2c90451d7522c2719ecf56e36532ec\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/75d7b2adea2c90451d7522c2719ecf56e36532ec/0_373_3705_2222/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Referee Marios Panayi laid bare the dark inner workings of the game\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Referee Marios Panayi laid bare the dark inner workings of the game.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Yves Herman / Reuters/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWhat he did was very brave,\u201d says Kartakoullis, a widely respected figure who now teaches sport management at the University of Cyprus. \u201cThere is corruption in every sphere of life in Cyprus, it\u2019s a problem not only of sport but of the whole of Cypriot society.\u201d</p> <p>Kartakoullis learned the hard way. Passionate about football from a young age he can still vividly recall discovering the depravity that lurked in the game. \u201cFor many, football was the answer to the traumatic experience of the [1974] Turkish invasion,\u201d he says recollecting the military campaign that led to the division of the island. \u201cLike a lot of refugees who ended up in camps I grew up playing it. I can still remember the moment when I scored and I was so happy because we had won and everyone started saying: \u2018Why are you celebrating? There\u2019s nothing to celebrate, that game was fixed.\u2019 And I was devastated, so disappointed that I said: \u2018One day you will study this, you will get to the root of this terrible thing.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Panayi, who started refereeing when he was 13, reckons that of Cyprus\u2019s 300 referees not more than 10% are \u201ctruly clean\u201d. Those who followed orders to fix games inevitably saw their careers fast tracked, with many going on to officiate European matches where earnings were three times higher than those on Cyprus. \u201cI had to speak, I had to talk about these things, so that finally the authorities would take action,\u201d he said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/jan/19/cyrpus-officials-bomb-attack-referees-mother\">Cyprus officials consider walkout after bomb at referee\u2019s mother\u2019s home</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Among the evidence given to police were recorded conversations he claimed proved the culpability of senior officials at the CFA. Two senior members of the Cyprus referees\u2019 association, including its head, Michalis Argyrou, were duly detained on match-fixing suspicions \u2013 and released after denying wrongdoing.</p> <p>\u201cWe read the accusations of Mr Panayi with pleasure,\u201d Francesco Baranca, Federbet\u2019s secretary general wrote in an email. \u201cWe consider Cyprus one of the dirtiest leagues in the world. We also consider Cyprus as a sort of \u2018school\u2019 of match fixing with a lot of players exporting the virus when they move to another league.\u201d</p> <p>It was so bad, he said, that bookmakers had long since stopped offering odds on top-tier games. \u201cFrom one year to the next nothing changes,\u201d he added in a telephone interview. \u201cIn places like Cyprus it is no longer a football competition but more an exercise in match fixing and I would say that, definitely, referees are part of the problem.\u201d</p> <p>Spyros Neofitides agrees with that assessment. His focus over the past year, almost exclusively, has been to raise awareness \u2013 not least sensitising footballers who fear loss of jobs or salary if they report incidents \u2013 and the 40-year-old Greek Cypriot is the first to concede that, invariably, it is money that lies at the root of the league\u2019s ills. Cyprus\u2019s financial meltdown in 2012 didn\u2019t help. In the run-up to the banking crisis, players were often forced to wait months to be paid \u2013 so much so that FifPro, the international football players\u2019 union, counselled members against signing contracts with Cypriot teams. Clubs with budgets of \u20ac25m suddenly had to cope with as little as \u20ac1.5m as they struggled with bankruptcy and debt.</p> <p>\u201cAfter the financial crisis we had a big problem with money,\u201d Neofitides says. \u201cA lot of businesses saw football as an opportunity to gain money through illegal betting. There are 350 players in the first division, another 280 in the second and for many clubs match fixing became a way of boosting funds. Players were often told games had to be fixed to pay salaries.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1bd06095a0ca12f97ab7ca462b8699d2ea12a663\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1bd06095a0ca12f97ab7ca462b8699d2ea12a663/0_0_3456_2304/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cypriot fans\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Players in the Cypriot league were often told games had to be fixed to pay salaries, according to Spyros Neofitides.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Yiannis Kourtoglou / Alamy Stock/Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Last year the union launched a two-month pilot program that allowed players to report cases where they suspected rigging. Findings exposed the problem\u2019s staggering scale: 71% of players in the second division and 67% in the first division admitted that games were rigged. Most attributed the phenomenon to illegal betting, with 23% saying they had been approached about matching fixing, either by the committees of clubs or during half-time when the only people who had access to changing rooms were club owners.</p> <p>Neofitides said research based on a 20-point questionnaire \u2013 drawn up by FifPro and the University of Manchester and disseminated by the PanCyprian Footballers Association \u2013 will support those claims when it, too, is released later this year. \u201cI\u2019ve seen the results already and I can say that 80% of the 220 first division players who answered the questionnaire admit they are aware of the problem,\u201d he says. \u201cThe thing is they are afraid to speak openly which is why it is now so important that the red button app is made available on mobile phones so they can report suspicions of match fixing with guaranteed anonymity.\u201d</p> <p>The House of Football stands at 10 Achaion Street, off a dual carriageway in Nicosia. It is here, on the third floor of a building inaugurated by Sepp Blatter and Michael Platini in June 2007, that Anthoulis Mylonas, the Cyprus Football Association\u2019s general manager, holds court.</p> <p>Rotund, genial with a ready smile, Mylonas is quick to deny the accusations. On the basis of the allegations, he says, the police not only confiscated the association\u2019s hard discs, books and ledgers but conducted a 10-month, in-depth inquiry leaving no stone unturned along the way. \u201cI went personally to police headquarters,\u201d explains the lawyer seated behind a desk surrounded by walls covered with championship cups and plaques. \u201cNo accusation against this office, or any employee, could be substantiated. In fact I would say we are the only organisation in Cyprus to be given a certificate from the state [proving] that we are clean. It\u2019s all in the past. It belongs to history.\u201d</p> <p>For many, though, Mylonas\u2019s protestations fall on deaf ears. The island may now have made a comeback since its near economic collapse but, say insiders, professional football is still prone to the dark arts.</p> <p>In recent weeks, the Football Association, under pressure from the justice ministry, has flexed its muscles by enforcing tough new regulations, with penalties of up to \u20ac10,000 and eventual loss of CFA funding for any club perceived by Uefa to be involved in manipulation of games. The measures came into force at the start of the new season on 22 August but Neofitides, for one, is far from hopeful the skulduggery will end there.</p> <p>Players, he laments, are still vulnerable to the punitive effects of the crisis \u2013 late payments in particular \u2013 and are rarely around long enough to really want to make a difference. \u201cIt begins and ends with education, changing mindsets,\u201d he says. \u201cUnfortunately around 70% of our players are foreign who are often in and out in a year and that makes changing attitudes very difficult.\u201d This year there had been instances of foreign players receiving death threats and even being forced to flee the island.</p> <p>After the bombs, after the death threats and inconclusive police investigation, what was needed was blue-sky thinking. And that, says Neofitides, should begin with a plan and specialised police department to deal with the problem. \u201cWe have to start with an action plan, a hot line that players can use and means like the red button app that will allow them to report fixing without worrying about [retribution]. We need to have the money to get a real campaign off the ground, with seminars, leaflets, locker room visits.\u201d</p> <p>And it all needs to be done very soon to save the integrity of the beautiful game \u2013 and before more violence erupts \u2013 in Cyprus.</p>",

  "<p>I was a human rights advocate for several years before becoming a lawyer. When I fell in love with human rights work, it wasn\u2019t because of international law \u2013 it was because of on-the-ground civil society collaborations and fact-finding investigations early in my career. Working abroad, I became sensitised to the importance of listening to and managing expectations when speaking with victims of human rights violations. I gave back as much as I could by bringing my knowledge of international law and human rights practice to the table and helping colleagues grow as advocates. As a result, I fostered strong relationships with a vibrant community of human rights workers from all over the world.</p> <p> After several years of moving between multiple continents to finish law school and get practical experience, I decided to settle and landed a legal researcher job at an NGO. I wasn\u2019t excited about doing desk research day in and day out, but the NGO\u2019s mission seemed important and interesting. Unfortunately, nothing could prepare me for the ignorance I was about to experience.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I\u2019m ashamed that there are human rights lawyers who think their law degrees alone qualify them to speak for victims</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>At this NGO, my colleagues were lawyers who wanted to speak for victims without understanding how to first listen and speak <em>to</em> victims.  This was exacerbated both by their collective lack of experience working in situations rife with human rights violations and by the NGO\u2019s institutional disinterest \u2013 even disdain \u2013 of people who focused on abuses outside its thematic and regional focus. </p> <p>All of this contributed to the office\u2019s low levels of sophistication in understanding human rights. For example, upon learning that a foundation had programmes to rescue scholars (not genocide victims), a colleague ridiculed the concept, equating the persecution of academics to people getting their dissertations rejected. Additionally, they didn\u2019t seem to understand that it could characterise the start of a genocide; that scholars can also be genocide victims. </p> <p>On a more personal level, I had shared with colleagues that my parents were persecuted out of a war-torn country. Yet I was shocked by senior colleagues\u2019 lack of basic sympathy to the plight of my ethnic group. Where\u2019s the compassion? The NGO doesn\u2019t focus on that part of the world, which means it considers those victims less worthy of its time. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/jun/28/secret-aid-worker-high-level-really-means-a-club-of-old-white-men\">Secret aid worker: 'High-level' really means a club of old white men</a> </p> </aside>  <p> I quickly realised that my boss, a strong supporter of the death penalty and military intervention, is a human rights advocate only when it suits \u2013 and only regarding certain rights, sometimes on a whim. Under my boss\u2019 direction, developing strategies to maximise practical impacts on the ground took a second seat to developing novel strategies just to say \u201cwe did it first\u201d. The amount of time wasted as a result is staggering. </p> <p>How important are the victims for whom the NGO purports to speak? I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m sure, however, that even the organisation\u2019s most meaningful work is at least partly driven by the self-promotional desires of a vanity NGO and its leadership.</p> <p> I\u2019m embarrassed to have been part of this NGO to the point where my family still doesn\u2019t know its name. I\u2019m ashamed that there are human rights lawyers who think their law degrees alone qualify them to speak for victims, despite lacking the expertise in the issues affecting the victims for whom they are speaking. I hope the lawyers at this NGO are an exception to the rule, but I\u2019m really afraid that this type of attitude could be alive and well in broader NGO culture. </p> <p><em>Do you have a secret aid worker story you\u2019d like to tell?

  "<p>Tougher regulations on the use of antibiotics on farm animals are needed as a matter of urgency as part of Brexit negotiations, campaigners and politicians have urged, after fresh revelations of superbugs found in UK supermarket meat products.</p> <p><em>E coli</em> germs resistant to all of the currently used antibiotics have been found in UK supermarket meat, with<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/05/antibiotic-resistant-e-coli-uk-supermarket-chicken-samples-contain\"> a quarter of chickens found to contain the deadly superbugs</a>, in research from Cambridge University.</p> <p>The discovery <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/video/2015/jun/18/superbugs-la-mrsa-pigs-antibiotics-video\">has been strongly linked</a> to the overuse of antibiotic medicines among farm animals, including chickens and pigs. </p> <p>Overuse of antibiotics among farm animals fosters the development of resistant germs, which can then infect people and cause serious illness. The Guardian <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/video/2015/jun/18/superbugs-la-mrsa-pigs-antibiotics-video\">has previously revealed</a> strong evidence of another \u201csuperbug\u201d resistant to antibiotics - MRSA - found in nearly one in 10 samples of UK supermarket pork.</p> <p>Current curbs on antibiotic use on UK livestock are among the regulations under discussion as the government prepares for Brexit. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jul/14/post-brexit-farming-subsidies-must-protect-nature-84-groups-say\">Campaigners fear</a> that these rules will be watered down under pressure from trading partners, with potentially catastrophic results for UK consumers.</p> <p>Peter Melchett, policy director of the Soil Association, told the Guardian: \u201cWe want the government to ban all routine use of antibiotics on groups of entirely healthy animals, to phase out the use of critically important antibiotics [on animals] and ensure that last-resort antibiotics are only used to treat individual farm animals, and only if no other antibiotics are found to be working. We want to see this enacted whether we are in the EU or out of it.\u201d</p> <p>Philip Lymbery, chief executive of Compassion in World Farming, said: \u201cThis new research makes it clear that the UK government must take urgent steps to save our antibiotics and avert a post-antibiotic era. The government must put in place policies to ban the routine preventative use of antibiotics in groups of entirely healthy animals.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/05/antibiotic-resistant-e-coli-uk-supermarket-chicken-samples-contain\">One in four supermarket chicken samples contain antibiotic-resistant E coli</a> </p> </aside>  <p>He also called for the use of certain critical antibiotics, regarded as the last line of defence against devastating human illnesses, to be kept from routine use in animals in order to retain their efficacy.</p> <p>\u201cIf we continue to sacrifice animal welfare in the name of cheap meat, future generations will pay the price for a long time to come,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Important trading partners such as the US and China have much lower animal welfare standards, and more lax controls on the use of antibiotics on their farms, than the UK and the EU. UK trade negotiators are likely to be under pressure to accept lower standards as a result, and more than 80 civil society organisations have called for the government to resist such attempts.</p> <p><em>E coli</em> can kill or cause serious illness, and the potency of the antibiotics used to counter it is being eroded, which scientists have linked to the over-use of antibiotics in treating farm animals. The discovery of food products on general sale in the UK harbouring resistant bugs has raised concern that current regulations on the use of antibiotics are insufficient to protect consumers.</p> <p>Under current rules, little oversight is kept of the use of antibiotics on individual farms. The UK\u2019s Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs keeps track of the volume of such drugs used overall in farming each year, but without keeping records of individual use and the reasons for it, leaving this to vets.</p> <p>Vets can find themselves under pressure, from farmers anxious to ensure they can continue to sell their livestock, and because they make money from prescriptions as well as advice.</p> <p>Even the current regulations - regarded as too weak by campaigners - are now under threat, as the government prepares for the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/small-business-network/2016/apr/12/would-vote-brexit-help-reduce-red-tape-vat-moss-smes\">\u201cbonfire of red tape\u201d on farming, that was called for by Brexiteers.</a></p> <p>Antibiotics have been at the forefront of the war against disease since the middle of the last century, but scientific developments have failed to keep up with the progress of the bugs. When antibiotics are used, most of the germs they target are killed, but a few can remain that evolve to develop and propagate resistance.</p> <p>When antibiotic medicines are over-used, for instance in healthy people or farmyard animals not at risk of disease, a higher proportion of the bugs develop this resistance, leading to larger populations of lethal superbugs.</p> <p>The discovery of germs resistant to <em>E coli</em> in many supermarket foods follows on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/jun/18/mrsa-superbug-in-supermarket-pork-raises-alarm-farming-risks\">revelations by the Guardian that MRSA-resistant bacteria was present in about a tenth of UK supermarket pork products</a>. MRSA is another antibiotic-resistant \u201csuperbug\u201d that can be fatal to vulnerable people, such as the very old and young, and can cause severe illness even in healthy people.</p> <p>The government could help to reward farmers with high animal welfare standards by blocking cheap foreign imports from countries with lower standards under future post-Brexit trade deals, added Tracy Worcester, director of Farms Not Factories, a pressure group. </p> <p>She said: \u201cLivestock from high animal welfare farms very rarely need to be given antibiotics. Farmers and the government could agree the farm gate price that reflects production costs. Cheap foreign imports could be blocked and all public services could procure meat produced with high animal welfare labels.\u201d</p> <p>She called on people to write to supermarkets to urge them to crack down on antibiotic use among their suppliers, and to take to social media on the issue.</p> <p>Molly Scott Cato, an MEP for the Green arty, said the party was strongly in favour of curbing routine antibiotic use in farming and monitoring the use of powerful drugs as a last resort. She said: \u201cWe need to ensure that human and animal health is put before the interests and profits of industrial-scale farming. The emerging EU legislation on the use of antibiotics in farming is setting a global standard for the sensible use of these drugs that are so essential for human health. It is vital that the UK adopt the highest standards that emerge from this legislative process.\u201d</p> <p>She added that farming subsidies to be paid for by UK taxpayers, after Brexit, must also only be handed out on the basis of strong health and environmental standards. \u201cWe need to ensure any new subsidies for agriculture should prioritise a transition away from intensive farming and towards an environmentally and ecologically sustainable agricultural industry,\u201d she said.</p>",
  "<p>Elle Macpherson has poured our tea, and now she is putting her spectacles on to demonstrate the new clasp she has designed for the very pretty front-fastening bra she is showing me in a Clerkenwell showroom. This, right here, is the difference between the new Elle Macpherson Body brand of lingerie and Elle Macpherson Intimates, with which she parted company two years ago.

Elle Macpherson Body is a 50-50 venture, into which she has put equal investment with Australian entrepreneur Simon de Winter. Everything about her vibe, as she talks me through her new range, seems intended to reposition her personal brand from the Peter Pan of dimpled surf chicks into a serious player in the fashion industry.

The new bras are designed both to look good, and to look good under clothes. This sounds obvious, but it\u2019s not: most pretty lingerie ruins the line of a silk blouse or a cotton T-shirt, while most T-shirt bras are hideous. The colours of Elle Macpherson Body are unusual: pistachio, teal, ginger. \u201cI looked at a lot of fashion for my colour palette \u2013 Gucci, Prada \u2013 and I found colours which work under clothes.

I wanted to make underwear that says you can be beautiful, strong, sexy, sporty and cool, and also be comfortable. The spectrum of beauty has got so much bigger than it was when I started out modelling \u2013 women don\u2019t need to fit into anybody\u2019s stereotype any more. We can dress to express ourselves and our personalities.\u201d This applies to Macpherson herself, now that she is in control of the business for the first time. \u201cI\u2019m not locked into lace land any more, thank goodness. I can make bras that look great under T-shirts and white shirts. Bras that make you feel good, you know?

There would be a dramatic increase in the fisheries and profits of individual countries. Do it now, do it as soon as you can. Put aside half of the world.\u201d</p> <p>Given that one in five fish that end up on the plate are caught illegally under current protections, Wilson\u2019s optimism for a sweeping increase in no-take areas seems misplaced. But the UN is finally edging towards addressing the question of the high seas \u2013 a festering omission from the <a href=\"http://www.un.org/depts/los/\">Law of the Sea</a> treaty signed three decades ago that clarified nations\u2019 rights along their coastlines but did little, critics contend, to conserve the oceans.</p> <p>In August, Unesco <a href=\"http://www.unesco.org/new/en/media-services/single-view/news/world_heritage_in_the_high_seas_an_idea_whose_time_has_come/#.V80ZWpMrLBK\">put forward</a> the idea of protecting certain prized jewels of the high sea. It imagined World Heritage status for areas such as the \u201cwhite shark cafe\u201d, the only known gathering point for white sharks in the north Pacific, the Atlantis Bank, a sunken fossil island in the Indian Ocean and the Sargasso sea, a productive area of the north Atlantic where a swirling gyre provides a concentration of algae that is vital for sharks, sea turtles and fish. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We\u2019ve got better maps of the surface of Venus than we do of our own sea floor</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>More formally, talks are taking place at the UN to thrash out a conservation plan for the high seas.

  "<p>Every year, my son spends half the summer in Ukraine with my parents. He has a ritual: as soon as he wakes up, sun glaring and white-hot at 8am, he runs into the garden, straight to the cucumber plant. My mum taught him how to twist them at the stem gently, so as not to pull on the whole plant, and how to embrace the sharp ends of the prickles on his soft palms: a quick polish and the spikes come off, leaving it safe for nibbling with abandon.</p> <p>We only use one word for cucumber in Ukraine \u2013 <em>ogirky \u2013</em> which refers to them in all their forms \u2013 fresh or pickled, and whatever variety. British cucumbers (those rather watery15cm-long behemoths!) are different to the smaller, spiky kind I grew up with. As a student shopping at the Warwick University branch of Tesco, I made do, and lLuckily, now I can get more compact and flavoursome varieties in London, although I don\u2019t think they\u2019ll ever make up for the gherkins we enjoy in Ukraine.</p> <p>Ukraine gets very hot in summer and the gherkins we get are rather dry \u2013 in a good way. They are dense, extremely fragrant and sweet. Picked while still warm, they are an absolute flavour bomb. Come early autumn, when the sun calms down a little and the cucumbers are not watered as much, they become even more intense. This is the time to start pickling. Not with vinegar, but by letting lacto bacteria do its job.</p> <p>Back in the day, when aircon wasn\u2019t in anyone\u2019s wildest dreams, Ukrainians built small kitchens close to where veg was grown, tiny brick houses where all the windows and doors could stay open to let some welcome air in to the mini preserving factories that they would become. One of the first things to pickle would be cucumbers.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/aug/31/ukrainian-courgette-caviar-recipe-olia-hercules\">Olia Hercules\u2019 recipe for courgette caviar | Recipes from Ukraine</a> </p> </aside>  <p>My mum and I love long-fermented gherkins \u2013 salty, strong beasts, almost olive green, the ones that make you wince, but still reach for another. (I call them \u201cnuclear\u201d gherkins.) My dad, however, loves a gentle one- or two-day ferment. <em>Malosolni ogirky</em> (literally \u201clittle-salted gherkins\u201d \u2013 those that are quickly pickled) are incredibly easy and a good introduction to fermentation. All you need is some good water (no chlorine as it kills bacteria) and organic produce (pesticides again get in the way of the process), salt, some flavourings and a maximum of two summer days. My Russian-Kazakh friend Mari, when in a rush, also uses carbonated water \u2013 extra CO2 is believed to be a catalyst for the process.</p> <p>If your kitchen is hot, the <em>malosolni</em> will be ready within 24 hours. And then ... oh my. Slightly fizzy, delicately sour, retaining freshness but with enough funk to be served with rye bread and lardo, taming the heat of a freshly downed ice-cold vodka shot. This is a classic I\u2019m giving you here. But I have also gone further than that. Add some halved chilli and garlic slices to the ferment. When ready, finely dice the gherkin and his friends. Then, alongside a small spoonful of the fizzy brine, pour it over an oyster. Because the ferment is so young, it won\u2019t kill the delicate oyster flavour. Basically, use as normal gherkins but with a fresher, funkier edge. And when the gherkins are gone, do not dump the brine. Use it as a vodka pickleback or drink it in the morning on a hangover. I grew up watching my dad do this, always bewildered \u2026 he hates the nuclear but he drinks that strong brine!</p> <h2><strong>Quick-fermented cucumbers</strong></h2> <p><strong>Makes 1 x 3 litre jar</strong><br>1kg fresh <a href=\"https://www.ocado.com/webshop/product/Natoora-Ridge-Cucumber/69875011?from=search&amp;tags&amp;param=cucumbers&amp;parentContainer=SEARCHcucumbers_SHELFVIEW\">organic cucumbers</a>, the smallest ones you can find<br>20g sea salt flakes<br>1 litre mineral water<br>1 red chilli, whole but bruised with the blade of a knife<br>10 garlic cloves<br>1 tsp raw honey<br>2 sprigs of leaf celery<br>10 peppercorns (pink are good too!)<br>1-2 dill umbrellas or some bruised dill stalks<br>Horseradish leaves, if available<br>Blackcurrant leaves, if available</p> <p><strong>1</strong> Sterilise your jar and a muslin cloth.</p> <p><strong>2</strong> Prepare the cucumbers by cutting them into the sizes and shapes you like.

(If you do this, add the herbs and spices too to infuse.) Leave the brine to cool down to room temperature.</p> <p><strong>4</strong> Now, pack the cucumbers, chilli, garlic, honey, celery, peppercorns, dill and leaves into the jar and cover with brine. If the cucumbers bob up at the top, cover them with the sterilised muslin and weigh it down with something. Sometimes I just wedge a couple of celery sticks across the neck of the jar to keep them under the brine.</p> <p><strong>5</strong> Leave in a warm place in your kitchen for at least 24 hours. Check the next day \u2013 if you see bubbles on the surface you are in luck. Take one pickled cucumber piece out with a sterilised fork to check. It should be pleasantly sour. If they don\u2019t taste too different, give them another day. If the weather is cool, you may need three days.</p> <p><strong>6</strong> When you are happy with the result and you don\u2019t want them to become stronger, pop them into the fridge to slow down the fermentation process. If you like some funk in your life, leave them for another few days.</p> <p>Note: You shouldn\u2019t have any problems in terms of infections. But if you see any blue growth, just take it off with a spoon carefully. Things are bad if you get slime in your brine, but this should not happen in such a short period of time. Just make sure you sterilise the jar properly.</p> <ul> <li><em>Olia Hercules is a chef, food writer and regular contributor to Cook.

Before 1 September, only people watching or recording live TV, on any device, had to pay for one.</p> <p>While the total number of TV-owning households is still rising, it is not doing so in line with increases in population, and that has thrown off the BBC\u2019s calculations, leading to the shortfall.</p> <p><strong>Why was a licence not needed for catch-up in the first place?</strong></p> <p>The current legislation governing TV licences was originally part of the 2003 Communications Act; the iPlayer was not launched <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2007/dec/13/bbc.digitalmedia\">until 2007</a>. In recent years more people have shifted to catch-up and online viewing, making rules written more than a decade ago even more outdated.</p> <p>While the average person in the UK still spends about 80% of their viewing time watching live or recorded TV, that figure is falling. Among younger generations the average is less than half that, and increasing numbers are not watching (or recording) live TV at all.</p> <p><strong>How does a TV licence work if I\u2019m watching iPlayer on my phone?</strong></p> <p>This is where the rules get a little strange. Most of the time, if you are watching iPlayer on any portable device (a laptop, smartphone or tablet), no matter where you are, you need a license covering your permanent address.</p> <p>But if you plug in that device, then the home or other building you are plugging it into must be covered by a licence. This is most relevant for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/sep/01/the-bbc-iplayer\">students living in halls</a>: if they want to watch iPlayer on a device without plugging it in, then they would normally be covered by their parents\u2019 licence. But as soon as they begin charging, they need a separate one covering their own room at university.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"476fe821687e148d4685d710ddb500b9a68fc74a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/476fe821687e148d4685d710ddb500b9a68fc74a/0_188_2999_1799/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A screenshot of the new iPlayer licence prompt\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A screenshot of the new iPlayer licence prompt.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC iPlayer/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>How can they tell if someone is watching iPlayer?</strong></p> <p>There has been extensive and wild speculation about how the BBC intends to enforce the new rules. <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/08/05/bbc-to-deploy-detection-vans-to-snoop-on-internet-users/\">One article claimed</a> that a fleet of BBC vans \u201cwill fan out across the country capturing information to \u2018sniff out\u2019 those who have not paid the licence fee\u201d by monitoring traffic going over Wi-Fi networks.</p> <p>The BBC and TV Licensing have flat-out denied they plan to monitor Wi-Fi networks, or that they will carry out any mass surveillance. However, by refusing to reveal how they <em>are</em> going to catch people not paying their licence, both organisations have left room for further speculation and sensational stories about auntie spying on iPlayer users.</p> <p>The truth is likely to be far less interesting. The BBC has long had powers to carry out targeted surveillance on those it thinks are dodging the licence fee under the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/06/labour-seeks-further-concessions-snoopers-charter-theresa-may\">Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act</a>, which is used by other organisations including the police. That means it\u2019s far more likely to be someone with a set of binoculars peering in your window to catch you watching iPlayer (which is authorised through Ripa) than some high-tech solution for tapping into your internet connection (which isn\u2019t authorised by anything).</p> <p><strong>So will the new rules make a difference?</strong></p> <p>The big question for the BBC is whether those people who were justifying not buying a TV licence because they didn\u2019t watch any live content will now decide to pay up. As TV Licensing said on the day the new rules were introduced, they \u201cexpect that most people will simply obey the law\u201d.</p> <p>Yet under the existing rules, many don\u2019t, and in 2015 Ministry of Justice records show more than 166,000 people were issued with fines for TV licence evasion. Few of those fines will be the result of any kind of active surveillance \u2013 most of them go to people who have failed to give a convincing case for not needing a licence.</p> <p>However, the deliberate vagueness about the techniques they have used to catch some people is designed to make people decide it is not worth the risk.</p> <p><strong>Why not just get people to put in their licence fee number to watch iPlayer?</strong></p> <p>This is the most obvious solution. However, while the corporation is thinking about making the iPlayer sign-in only, there are no plans to link it to the licence fee or an address, which would make it relatively simple to work out who is watching without paying.</p> <p>One argument against linking the two is that it would move the BBC closer to an online subscription service similar to Netflix or Amazon, something critics of the licence fee support. But the BBC\u2019s output is very different to online streaming services \u2013 the latter do not, for instance, include news bulletins \u2013 and such a move would make it more difficult to finance output such as radio and digital news, which don\u2019t currently require a licence.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/sep/01/the-bbc-iplayer\">iPlayer licence rules have changed \u2013 but there's one loophole left for students</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>What will happen to the licence fee in the future?</strong></p> <p>The BBC will have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/jul/03/after-brexit-politicians-bbc-royal-charter\">its royal charter renewed</a> at the end of the year, and has agreed a funding deal with government stretching until 2020. This will see the licence fee increase with inflation, so the system looks stable for the foreseeable future.</p> <p>But the debate about the new rules has brought to the fore questions about a system of funding that was designed for a world where there was only one broadcaster.</p> <p>For instance, technically, someone watching ITV or Channel 4 on a TV still needs a licence, but that is not true if they watch on-demand services direct from either provider. And with more and more on-demand TV available, the number of people who can legitimately claim to not watch any BBC content is likely to grow.</p> <p>If it grows large enough, the BBC will have a hard time justifying the licence fee. It could either embrace a subscription model and risk losing its special status as a national broadcaster, or it could convince the government that it deserves a new model for funding that preserves its independence. Neither prospect will be particularly appealing to the corporation.</p> <ul> <li>This article was amended on 6 September 2016 to remove a reference to the BBC making a licence fee compulsory for iPlayer users.

Here are some of their responses. </p> <h2>The good</h2> <h2>Work that matters</h2> <p>\u201cI love working on the key issues facing our country and the world today. Being \u2018in the room\u2019 and providing ministers with advice and options to consider is something I am incredibly proud of. It\u2019s always fun to be working on the issues all your friends are talking about in the pub.\u201d <strong tabindex=\"-1\"> Matt, 24*. </strong></p> <p>\u201cI love knowing that my work has impact, seeing policies I have worked on in newspapers. The civil service gives you real responsibility rather than just feeling like you\u2019re an intern making coffee. The moment I realised I had really made it was when I met the chairman for the company my mum cleans for.\u201d<strong>Beth, 25.</strong></p> <h2>Great opportunities</h2> <p>\u201cSheer diversity. No where else could you go from working in prisons to health to pensions without ever leaving. I have met some of the brightest and most committed people.\u201d<strong> Mary, 22.</strong><br></p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve had great opportunities to attend training that has really helped me to develop, and at work I\u2019ve continually been given stretching challenges. It\u2019s also very rewarding to know that you are working for the public good.\u201d <strong>Alex</strong><strong>, 21.</strong></p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve been brought together with an amazing bunch of like-minded people, some of whom I\u2019ve formed real friendships with outside work. The work has been super interesting so far. I work on policy that is incredibly relevant and current and it\u2019s very interesting to work in the engine room of central government.\u201d<strong tabindex=\"-1\"> Anna, 23.</strong></p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I have met some of the brightest and most committed people</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <h2>Trust</h2> <p>\u201cBeing trusted by my managers is a big draw for me to the public sector. In other, private sector jobs, I felt like a workhorse that my manager wanted to get their money\u2019s worth out of. In the civil service I am trusted to manage my time responsibly and to get tasks done.\u201d<strong> Karen, 25.</strong></p> <h2>The bad</h2> <h2>Inflexibility </h2> <p>\u201cIt can be slow to get things done at times. For good and for bad there is a big focus put on stakeholder engagement, whatever it is you are doing. Most of the time this is great as you get to see what all the different views are on something and it can help you no end. At times though it can be frustrating when you are waiting for so many different people to comment. Different departments can have very different views on something and it can take a long time to come to an agreement.\u201d <strong>Matt, 24.</strong> </p> <h2>Pay</h2> <p>\u201cThe pay is not as attractive as some private sector opportunities, but I would argue that the quality of work and the other benefits (work/life balance, pension, etc) more than outweigh this.\u201d<strong> Matt 24.</strong></p> <p><strong>\u201c</strong>Pay is a particular concern. I am paid less in 2016 than I was as a new joiner in 2012 for doing substantially the same job. I am required to live in London but given no London weighting for my salary \u2013 half of my take home pay goes on rent alone.\u201d <strong>David, 30.</strong> </p> <h2>Rigid career paths</h2> <p>\u201cFast streamers have no career control for four years. Fast streamers are prohibited from applying for other roles within the civil service and this can be extremely frustrating as opportunities pass by. The lack of direct input into jobs is a big concern. Department and role allocations are done in secret and the results announced as a fait accompli. This can be disempowering and some roles are extremely poor quality, whilst others turn out to be unintentionally excellent.\u201d <strong> David, 30.</strong></p> <p>\u201cThere is no senior career path for experienced qualified staff unless they are on a scheme such as the fast stream. This discriminates against older staff or those who aren\u2019t graduates.\u201d <strong> Maria, 46.</strong></p> <p>\u201cToo many civil servants have no experience of other workplaces or other ways of doing things and the civil service is not keeping pace with more modern attitudes to careers. I was keen to have a more varied career, with time out on secondment or for study, but the rules are very restrictive in many departments. My only choice was to leave, at which point I was told \u2018you know there\u2019s no way back?\u2019 \u2013 which is currently true, given the lack of external recruitment in vast majority of roles.\u201d <strong> Catherine, 36.</strong></p> <h2>Still too many white men</h2> <p>\u201cI grew up on a council estate and while I went to a good school and university, I did not go to Oxbridge. When I first joined the civil service I lacked confidence and felt I did not belong there or was good enough to be on the fast stream. It is a difficult place to start working when you feel your face does not fit. Eventually I did find that not all of the civil service or the fast stream is comprised of privately-educated white men, but it did take time before I felt like I belonged.\u201d <strong>Beth, 25. </strong><br></p> <h2><strong>Not sure about making a difference</strong></h2> <p>\u201cYou can be very remote from the impact of your work. It\u2019s hard to know sometimes the extent of the contribution that you are making.\u201d <strong>Alex, 21.</strong></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/public-leaders-network/2014/sep/03/civil-service-fast-stream-other-routes\">What to do if you don\u2019t get on the civil service fast stream</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>And the ugly</h2> <h2>Lack of resources </h2> <p> \u201cThe message that in some areas our job was to do as little as we could get away with, because of a lack of resources in areas such as climate change was very disheartening.\u201d<strong> Anna, 36. </strong></p> <h2>Lack of diversity</h2> <p><strong>\u201c</strong>I do think the civil service struggles with diversity, particularly on the fast stream. It needs to do far more to get more people on the fast stream from working class and ethnic minority backgrounds. Only in the past year have the civil service talked about social mobility and people from ethnic minorities are more likely to drop out of the fast stream,\u201d<strong> Beth, 25.</strong> </p> <h2>Poor management</h2> <p>\u201cI have had a very poor experience of the fast stream to date. My postings have been of poor quality, my managers have not been particularly good and the support from the fast stream team, while better than it was, is still not good enough. Others in the fast stream have had great postings and are getting a lot out of it, but I am not.

  "<p>Maestra began as a combination of two fictional failures. Several years ago, my then agent suggested I try writing something erotic, but she disliked the result, and I set it aside to finish the project I was working on, a political biography of Elizabeth I. One of the ideas I wanted to explore within Elizabeth\u2019s governance was her capacity to manipulate the expectations of patriarchy; she confounded and bamboozled several generations of ambassadors by playing on their assumptions about gender when it suited her, inverting their prejudices to her own ends. Maybe that was lingering in my head when I turned back to those rejected pages and decided to put them together with a story I started during my time as an intern at an auction house.</p> <p>The product was pretty hopeless, derivative stuff, but there was quite an interesting narrative line about a fake painting by the eighteenth century artist George Stubbs. Juxtaposing an erotic story with an art world thriller required a very particular protagonist, and once I heard Judith Rashleigh\u2019s voice, I found I couldn\u2019t let her go until the novel was finished just two months later. Much of it was written in the South of France, and perhaps it was that which gave the book what I felt was a holiday air. As someone who usually loathes writing and will do almost anything to avoid it, this was the first time, after eight previous books, that I experienced anything like pleasure in constructing a story.<br></p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>One person\u2019s erotica very swiftly becomes another person\u2019s comedy.</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Everyone hated my book. My agent hated it, and my publisher hated it, and pretty much everyone I showed it to hated it. Even now that Maestra has been sold in 42 countries and garnered a film deal, it still seems to make a lot of readers furious. Equally, I have been hugely flattered and encouraged by the number who love it, particularly younger women who have told me that they feel empowered by the story, seeing Judith as a new kind of feminist heroine. Yet both reactions surprise me, demonstrating the disconnect between intention and interpretation. I thought I\u2019d written something quite playful and entertaining, about a latter-day Becky Sharp who, in Vanity Fair, finds herself adrift in a man\u2019s world with nothing but her looks and her wits; I had no idea it would enrage some readers as much as it delighted others. Elizabeth: Renaissance Prince was a far more radical book, but 16th century gender politics apparently operate at a safer remove. </p> <p>Many journalists have asked me why I turned from writing respectable history books to a presumably disreputable novel, to which all I can say is: if you spend as long as I have hanging around in Renaissance Europe, sex and violence have very little left to shock you with. I didn\u2019t experience the process as different in any way, in that whether one is writing history or fiction, construction, pace, detail and narrative plausibility remain paramount. Maestra does contain sex scenes, but I was interested in the technical challenge of how to write them. One person\u2019s erotica very swiftly becomes another person\u2019s comedy, so I was engaged with forming scenes which play an integral part in the plot in a way that read as fresh, honest and most importantly modern. Judith is a product of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/aug/12/the-tinder-generation-is-real-app-has-online-meltdown-over-vanity-fair-article\">Tinder generation</a>: the way she thinks about and recounts her experiences had to work linguistically, in her own voice, and in a vocabulary which is, I think, realistic \u2013 if not terribly \u201cliterary\u201d. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/apr/03/maestra-ls-hilton-digested-read\">Maestra by LS Hilton \u2013 digested read</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Maestra has changed my life in many ways, not least in that I have spent much of the last year on planes. Sometimes I even get to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/04/air-rage-inequality-happiness-plane-passengers\">turn left</a>. But I have also had to defend my work more thoroughly and publicly than was ever required by the more genteel tempo of historical biography. Staring at the sky, I reflect that it may not be a good book, but it has made me a much better writer, in that I have been forced to consider and investigate a process which was previously reflexive. I find I care about writing much more than I believed I did. I\u2019d never really thought of myself as A Writer, but I find myself quite pleased that I\u2019ve managed to make so many people angry. It must mean that I\u2019m doing my job.</p> <h2>Extract</h2> <p>There was something close to the almost unbearable quality of desire to those next three days. The white noise of the beloved\u2019s absence which hums and whispers constantly in the ear, in the veins. I waited like a woman in love, like a hidden mistress who will only be delivered from the languorous torment of lack by her lover\u2019s tread in the passage of a cheap hotel. Each morning I ran, pushing myself up the vertiginous hiking tracks until my thighs shook and my calves burned. I ordered lunch and dinner, but could barely eat. I smoked until I retched water and lit cigarettes through the metallic taint of my own guts. I bought a bottle of cheap brandy and some over-the-counter sleeping pills and tried to knock myself out every night, but woke before the light with a thin wire of pain in my skull, watching my own heart beat under the frail, dawn-blue sheet. I felt the skin hollow out under my cheekbones; the plane of my hip became hard against my palm. I tried to read, on benches overlooking the postcard views, hunched on my windowsill, stretched out on the little shingle beach, but all I could really do was stare into space and endlessly, endlessly check my phone.

A victory for openness, and a clear message to those global corporations that shift profits to low tax havens, that we expect them to play by the same rules as every other business.\u201d</p> <p>Among the MPs to back the amendment was the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, the current and former chairs of the public accounts committee, Meg Hillier and Margaret Hodge, and Conservative members of the committee. During her campaign to become leader of the Conservatives, Theresa May had promised to be tough on tax evasion and avoidance.</p> <p>Other MPs supporting the amendment include members of the Scottish National party, the Ulster Unionist party, the Social Democratic and Labour party, Plaid Cymru and the Liberal Democrats. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/CarolineFlintMP/status/772903128681291777\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Fantastic news Govt accepts my Am 145 to enable the introduction of public country-by-country reporting.

  "<p> Turkish coal plants are in line for eye-watering public subsidies and exemptions from environmental regulations, under an amended energy package delivered by the country\u2019s parliament, late last week.</p> <p> Turkey is a member of the G20, whose two leading economies \u2013 the US and China \u2013 agreed to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/03/breakthrough-us-china-agree-ratify-paris-climate-change-deal\">ratify the Paris climate change agreement</a> on Saturday.</p> <p>The G20 summit which ended in Hangzhou, China, yesterday also came <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/30/leading-insurers-tell-g20-to-stop-funding-fossil-fuels-by-2020\">under pressure</a> to put a deadline to an old pledge to phase out fossil fuel subsidies. </p> <p> But MPs and campaigners say that the new amendment known as Article 80 could instead open Turkey\u2019s door to extraordinary largesse for the coal sector and other big energy projects, unfettered by environmental considerations.</p> <p>Utku \u00c7ak\u0131r\u00f6zer, an MP for the opposition Republican party (CHP) said: \u201cThis bill will give the government a huge mandate to bypass environmental impact assessments.

A commission spokeswoman said: \u201cTurkey\u2019s cross-subsidies are still a concern as it means that a fully functioning cost-based electricity market does not yet exist\u201d.</p> <p>The Turkish government did not respond to requests for comment. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/aug/06/is-it-too-late-to-stop-turkeys-coal-rush\">Is it too late to stop Turkey's coal rush?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The opposition CHP party <a href=\"http://www.gazeteduvar.com.tr/gundem/2016/09/01/chp-torba-yasa-icin-anayasa-mahkemesine-hazirlaniyor/\">said last week</a> that it would appeal to the Turkish supreme court against the bill.

But this was subsequently not done, he said.</p> <p>Administrators later issued a \u201ccall notice\u201d requesting $16m from Queensland Nickel\u2019s parent companies to keep Queensland Nickel operating.</p> <p>The request, which included $1.2m in wages, $9.4m for ore supplies and $5.2m in other purchases, needed the approval of a joint venture committee chaired by Palmer.</p> <p>Wolfe said he had concerns about the format of the request because it did not look like call notices last issued when he was working at Queensland Nickel during the 1990s before it was owned by Palmer. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a call notice, it was a certificate,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Barrister Tom Sullivan \u2013 acting for a special purpose liquidator \u2013 pressed Wolfe on whether he had relayed his concerns to the administrator about the request.</p> <p>Wolfe said he had not as he had been shown a letter by Palmer\u2019s nephew Clive Mensink \u2013 who was sole director of Queensland Nickel and the two parent companies as well as a member of the joint venture operating committee with Palmer \u2013 which was to be sent to the administrator indicating the joint venture committee\u2019s problem with the request.</p> <p>He \u201ccomplied with all requests\u201d put to him by the administrator but was not asked about the funding request, Wolfe said.</p> <p>Asked whether Queensland Nickel\u2019s parent companies were able to pay the $16m to Queensland Nickel, Wolfe replied that the bank account of the entire Queensland Nickel group was then under the control of administrators.</p> <p>While the initial understanding of all involved was that Queensland Nickel upon entering administration would continue to manage the nickel refinery joint venture, Wolfe said he now believed Queensland Nickel had been terminated as manager as soon as FTI Consulting took over.</p> <p>FTI Consulting was given notice of termination on 7 March.</p> <p>While the intention was for the other joint venture companies to continue operating the refinery after Queensland Nickel\u2019s termination as manager, Wolfe said the challenge was the transfer of assets and operating licences still held by the administrator.</p> <p>Sullivan suggested the bigger challenge was the fact the administrator had to dismiss the remaining 500-plus Queensland Nickel workers because it had not funds to pay them.</p> <p>Wolfe replied: \u201cMy understanding is the administrators terminated the employment of the staff because they got spooked over Chinese New Year by the drop in the nickel price.\u201d</p> <p>Wolfe also told the court Palmer did not discuss the prospect of insolvent trading by Queensland Nickel until months after a cash flow forecast showed the company falling more than $6m short on its debts.</p> <p>Wolfe said held \u201cmany meetings\u201d about the company\u2019s financials with Palmer including in September last year when the cash shortfall emerged.</p> <p>But they discussed the problem then \u201cin terms of cash flows\u201d, with insolvency raised by Palmer only when examining a restructure for Queensland Nickel with a business advisory firm in December or January, Wolfe said.</p> <p>The questions of whether Queensland Nickel traded while insolvent \u2013 unable to pay debts as they fell due \u2013 and whether Palmer was a shadow director are a key focus of the court hearing by liquidators into the company\u2019s collapse.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"199a9ffb8f31511fb3a877d9ba8a8fb49af1a897\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/199a9ffb8f31511fb3a877d9ba8a8fb49af1a897/0_104_2242_2029/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Daren Wolfe\" width=\"1000\" height=\"905\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Queensland Nickel\u2019s former chief financial officer Daren Wolfe outside the federal court in Brisbane on Monday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dan Peled/AAP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Insolvent trading opens company directors to the possibility of civil or criminal penalties.<br></p> <p>Palmer was not a director of Queensland Nickel in 2015 but Wolfe said he was aware of Palmer\u2019s authority in approving Queensland Nickel management decisions, including expenditure, through his role as chairman of a joint venture committee.</p> <p>Wolfe did not accept the contention by barrister Tom Sullivan, acting for the special purpose liquidator, that the September cash flow forecast showed an \u201cactual shortfall\u201d in cash reserves, meaning Queensland Nickel was unable to pay debts \u201cas and when they fell due\u201d.</p> <p>Wolfe said this was because he was aware that the major creditor, rail operator Aurizon, had been \u201cflexible\u201d with late payments. However, he admitted he did not know at that time whether Queensland Nickel had secured an agreement to push back the date of payment.</p> <p>Wolfe said there were not sufficient funds within Queensland Nickel to pay wages in November, which prompted Palmer to inject $1.9m of his own cash into the company\u2019s bank account.</p> <p>When pressed on whether he agreed the company was in \u201cserious financial difficulty\u201d by December \u2013 when Queensland Nickel was threatening to coal supplier Glencore that it would cease operating \u2013 Wolfe would say only that it was \u201ccertainly evidencing tight cashflow\u201d.</p> <p>The court heard an email from Palmer, using an alias \u201cTerry Smith\u201d, referred to a $7,392 upgrade to equipment at the refinery. \u201cWhen overhaul is scheduled, delay it to December.

I didn\u2019t doubt it or challenge it until this day. Ariana encouraged me a lot by showing me and showing all mixed girls the way.\u201d</p> <p>Yoshikawa said her background did not disqualify her or other mixed race people from representing Japan. \u201cWe are Japanese,\u201d she said. \u201cYes I\u2019m half Indian and people are asking me about my purity \u2013 yes my dad is Indian and I\u2019m proud of it, I\u2019m proud that I have Indian in me.

Zero national characteristics,\u201d one poster said.

  "<p>To negotiate parts of the Cardiff Bay trail by bike on a sunny day is, if not an art, then at least a good test of spatial awareness. Among those on foot and two wheels are families with pushchairs, older people on bikes, kids running, and kids on go-karts and scooters. It\u2019s a picture postcard of the pent-up demand for safe walking and cycling routes away from motor traffic. </p> <p>While many of us know our towns and cities could look like this \u2013 more people-centric and less car-centric \u2013 in reality, a lack of political will and consistent funding often puts that out of reach. Here in Wales, a piece of legislation which places people friendly streets is within grasp \u2013 if people speak up and tell politicians what to do. </p> <p>The <a href=\"http://gov.wales/topics/transport/walking-cycling/activetravelact/?lang=en\">Active Travel (Wales) Act</a> requires Welsh councils to map their existing walking and cycling routes, and then set about improving and linking them up. The initial mapping stage now complete, people are being asked to say where they want new routes and, crucially, politicians will have a legal obligation to consult anyone who expresses an interest in shaping this process. </p> <p>It can be as simple as: \u201cI want a safe route to walk, cycle or scoot from my neighbourhood to my child\u2019s school.\u201d</p> <p>Cycling UK and Sustrans Cymru say it\u2019s key that people get involved, as the act\u2019s success is far from guaranteed, and have created <a href=\"https://action.cyclinguk.org/ea-action/action?ea.client.id=1689&amp;ea.campaign.id=54239\">a simple web form</a> to help people show politicians that this matters to them. </p> <p>As Cycling UK\u2019s chief executive, Paul Tuohy, puts it: \u201cWe have this act, which means [politicians] have to respond to public consultation, but like a lot of really good ideas, even if they do there\u2019s no guarantee anything will be done.\u201d</p> <p>Already there have been signs of unravelling. Many Welsh councils submitted route maps that were a fraction of the real \u2013 if flawed \u2013 cycle network. I\u2019m told that\u2019s because they don\u2019t meet the new Welsh cycle infrastructure standards. Rather than include all of the network, with the disclaimer some parts weren\u2019t up to scratch, the bad bits were simply left off the map.</p> <p>Sustrans Cymru\u2019s head of external affairs, Chris Roberts, a former special advisor to the Welsh Government, calls the first mapping stage a \u201cdry run\u201d, the important bit, he says, being what happens next. Every route people suggest to local authorities \u2013 so long as it has some utility value, taking people to work, to shops, or schools \u2013 should be mapped, and once it\u2019s there, councils have an obligation to keep building cycling and walking routes within that map. The more people propose routes now, the more routes could be built. </p> <p>People want the Act to work. It started life as a petition from schoolchildren to the Welsh Assembly, before entering Welsh Labour\u2019s party manifesto and becoming law. It seems fitting people get to shape its future.</p> <p>Government should want it, too. Health is the Welsh Government\u2019s biggest single spend, 48% of its total budget, so there\u2019s an incentive to take more active travel seriously.</p> <p>It\u2019s no coincidence Assembly member Rebecca Evans, Welsh minister for social services and public health, has the Act among her specific ministerial responsibilities, able, she says, to \u201cdevote a significant amount of effort to promoting active travel\u201d. </p> <p>\u201cI know how excited people are about this Act and the change that it can make if we get it right,\u201d she says. </p> <p>\u201cThis is about supporting local authorities now, to be able to discharge their new duties under the Act fully, so we\u2019re aiming to give local authorities the utmost support that they need in order to do that.\u201d </p> <p>Although Evans insists Welsh local authorities are on-board, and \u201cthe spirit is there\u201d, whether that is the case remains to be seen. A traffic regulation currently bans cycling between 11am-5pm on 11 streets in Newport City Centre.</p> <p>Nonetheless there\u2019s the legal duty for those still unconvinced about cycling and walking not to drag their feet, both under the Active Travel Act and the Wellbeing of Future Generations (Wales) Act. </p> <p>One thing that\u2019s not there, though, is the money. There\u2019s just \u00a314m, to be spent among 22 Welsh Local Authorities \u2013 a pittance in infrastructure terms, especially when propped up alongside the UK government\u2019s \u00a315bn roads fund. However, as Tuohy points out, the funds are out there.</p> <p>He says: \u201cPoliticians are spending a lot of money on transport, it\u2019s just a question of priorities and percentages.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou get sick of spouting Amsterdam and Copenhagen [as examples of cities good with active travel], which are genuinely amazing, but you need political champions to really believe in it, because you can change Cardiff, you can change London, but you have to have the vision.\u201d </p> <p>He hopes if routes are carefully chosen and well executed, they will make the case for more of the same.</p> <p>\u201cIn terms of pound for pound, boy is it going to pay itself back,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen you think of the money it takes to build just one mile of motorway, how many miles of cycle routes and walkways you can get for that, it\u2019s just a no brainer, so what on earth are our politicians thinking when they do this stuff? So let\u2019s wake the public up a bit to say: \u2018no, we want it to change\u2019. They are our politicians, we vote them in, and we can vote them out.\u201d</p> <p>And if Wales can do it, we should be asking ourselves, why can\u2019t the rest of the UK?</p>",

But we\u2019re talking 21st-century middle-aged, 50 is the new 30 or something, where teenage kids not needing looking after all the time is an opportunity to put on, not slippers, but dancing shoes, romancing shoes maybe. Adam (James Nesbitt) is inevitably in the middle of a classic mid-life crisis. He\u2019s getting married again, to a lady he met while working in Singapore. She is 18 years younger than he is; he has had his rug resewn.</p> <p>Pete (John Thomson) meets him at Manchester airport in a taxi. Adam hops in the back, not realising that it\u2019s Pete\u2019s actual taxi: this is cab confusion gag number one. Pete\u2019s mid-life crisis is a different, more of a proper crisis \u2013 it\u2019s about losing his job, having to get two more (he\u2019s also a care worker for old folk) just to make ends meet. It\u2019s about losing mojo and getting depressed.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/sep/04/cold-feet-return-itv-fay-ripley-john-thompson\">Our old friends in the north: Cold Feet is back \u2013 and Helen Baxendale nearly was too</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Jenny (Fay Ripley) mucks along, but it\u2019s not easy, being with Pete without his mojo. Will she look elsewhere perhaps, as she did before? Karen (Hermione Norris) has given up on ever finding love again. David (Robert Bathurst) has about as much love in his new marriage as Chris Huhn and Vicky Pryce had at the end of theirs, plus a similar hey-do-you-fancy-my-speeding-points-darling storyline as well.</p> <p>At least Adam bounding back from the Far East, plus his impending and probably misguided nuptials, gives them something to get animated about again.

That\u2019s an awful lot of the same joke in a single episode. Four, if you include the moment when Pete later pretends to be David\u2019s driver, to try to impress the bride\u2019s father, Mr Zubayr. \u201cThat [Zubayr] would be a nightmare hand at Scrabble,\u201d says David, obviously not a Scrabble player.</p> <p>The overcooked car-confusion thing aside, and the travelator fiasco (though I do like Pete and Jenny\u2019s son\u2019s \u201cwhen travelators attack\u201d comment), I\u2019m enjoying this reunion. Certainly it\u2019s more successful than <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2007/jan/03/broadcasting.tvandradio\">This Life +10</a> was.

Teenagers make more interesting television than babies. Bullen \u2013 and the cast \u2013 tackle the challenge with the same wit and warmth and humanness that they did last time out.</p> <p>It is a relief, then, that something that could have been a really bad idea isn\u2019t.

  "<p>The number of prosecutions relating to violence against women and girls in England and Wales reached a record level last year, the director of public prosecutions said, as she warned of the increasing use of social media to threaten and control.</p> <p>Alison Saunders said the ease with which such crimes could be committed online was contributing to the increase in prosecutions. The number of offences against women, including domestic abuse, rape and sexual assaults, rose by almost 10% to 117,568 in 2015-16. </p> <p>Speaking to the Guardian as the Crown Prosecution Service published its annual report on violence against women and girls, Saunders said: \u201cThe use of the internet, social media and other forms of technology to humiliate, control and threaten individuals is rising and it is something that we will possibly see increase further. It is undoubtedly easier to commit a lot of these crimes online, people do it without thinking, it is more immediate and it is about the reach and ability to communicate to so many more people.\u201d<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>New offences such as the recently passed revenge porn laws were also adding to the caseload. Since the new law of <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/oct/11/revenge-porn-175-cases-reported-to-police-in-six-months\">disclosing private sexual images without consent</a> was introduced in April 2015, there have been 206 cases of revenge pornography taken to court \u2013 with many individuals pleading guilty, according to the DPP.</p> <p>These include a defendant who sent intimate photos of a woman to members of her family via Facebook and threatened to post further pictures online. He was sentenced to 12 weeks\u2019 imprisonment suspended for 18 months after he pleaded guilty to an offence of disclosing private sexual images without consent.</p> <p>Another defendant posted intimate pictures of a woman, who was not aware the photographs had been taken, onto Facebook. He was sentenced to a 12 month community order, fined \u00a3110, ordered to pay court costs of \u00a3295 and given an indefinite restraining order.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/sep/2016-09-05T18:55:41/embed.html\" data-alt=\"Stalking prosecutions\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/sep/2016-09-05T18:55:41/embed.html\">Stalking prosecutions</a> </figure>  <p>However, 206 prosecutions reflect a tiny proportion of complaints of so-called revenge porn.

In 2015-16 the CPS prosecuted more cases of stalking and harassment \u2013 12,986 \u2013 than ever before. Of those, almost 70% involved ongoing domestic abuse, and many perpetrators used the internet or other technology to carry out the offending.<br></p> <p>Such is the scale of the offending that special guidance is being issued to prosecutors about the growth of cyber stalking to improve prosecutions. Guidance is also being given to prosecutors on<strong> </strong>the use of false online profiles and websites which are being <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/mar/03/online-trolls-revenge-porn-new-prosecutors-guidelines\">set up in the victim\u2019s name</a>, containing false and damaging information intended to harass and intimidate.</p> <p>But the DPP accepted that historical under-reporting of offences such as stalking, domestic violence, rape and sexual assaults, meant that the number of cases being charged was only a proportion of the offending taking place.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/sep/2016-09-05T18:55:24/embed.html\" data-alt=\"Child sex abuse prosecutions\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/sep/2016-09-05T18:55:24/embed.html\">Child sex abuse prosecutions</a> </figure>  <p>Other key areas relating to online abuse showed sharp increases in the number of cases being brought. These include a 32% rise, to 2,094 cases, of sending <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/mar/04/online-abuse-existing-laws-too-fragmented-and-dont-serve-victims-says-police-chief\">grossly offensive or indecent messages</a> under the Malicious Communications Act, and a 20% increase to 2,026 in similar offending under section 127 of the Communications Act. The DPP said these cases related mostly to online abuse, or abuse via text, email and other forms of technology.</p> <p>Saunders also identified an emerging area of concern as the use of extremely violent pornographic communications, such as women being raped, or the posting of images of women who have suffered severe injuries or are being subjected to sadistic violence. She highlighted increases in prosecutions under new sections of the law for such cases, with 1,737 prosecutions in the past year.</p> <p>Saunders said everyone from tech companies like Twitter and Facebook, to police and the CPS and wider society, needed to do more to tackle the growing scale of threatening and abusive communications online. \u201cThe flip side of that is that the evidence is out there and it is pretty incontrovertible evidence. We have been working with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/mar/03/twitter-to-train-prosecutors-in-fight-against-online-abuse\">Twitter and Facebook to help us train prosecutors</a> in how to be aware of what evidence is available and talking to them about how they can help us and victims.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/sep/2016-09-05T18:54:43/embed.html\" data-alt=\"Rape prosecutions\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/sep/2016-09-05T18:54:43/embed.html\">Rape prosecutions</a> </figure>  <p>The scale of offences make up nearly 19% of prosecutors\u2019 workload \u2013 more than any other single tranche of crime, including terrorism and fraud.</p> <p>While some, including Maria Miller MP \u2013 chair of the House of Commons women and equalities committee \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jul/07/former-culture-secretary-maria-miller-police-powers-to-tackle-online-abuse\">have called for tech companies</a> to take more responsibility for what they publish or face paying for the policing of online crimes, Saunders said she believed tech companies were doing more to take down abusive communications and accounts.</p> <p>But she added: \u201cI am sure there is much more that tech companies can do to stem the flow. There is far more that all of us can do and that society as a whole can do to tackle this and make it unacceptable. We need to make sure prosecutors and the police are up to date with how people are using social media, what new platforms are emerging, what type of evidence we might gather and how we might use it in prosecutions.\u201d</p> <p>Rachel Krys, co-director of the End Violence against Women Coalition, said the rise in prosecutions being brought by the CPS was a positive sign.<br></p> <p>\u201cWe welcome this comprehensive report, the transparency it offers and the CPS\u2019s ongoing attention to violence against women and girls in all its forms. The increase in prosecutions shows that more women are seeking justice.</p> <p>\u201cBut it is still the case that the majority of women and girls subject to these crimes do not report them to the police, and the specialist services which support them are fighting for survival.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Dear Friends,</p> <p>I wish to address this short statement to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/geert-wilders\">Mr Geert Wilders</a>, his acolytes, indeed to all those like him \u2013 the populists, demagogues and political fantasists. </p> <p>To them, I must be a sort of nightmare.

And I am angry, too. Because of Mr Wilder\u2019s lies and half-truths, manipulations and peddling of fear. You see, twenty years ago I served in the UN peacekeeping force during the Balkan wars \u2013 wars so cruel, so devastating, which flowed from this same factory of deceit, bigotry and ethnic nationalism.</p> <p>Geert Wilders released his grotesque eleven-point manifesto only days ago, and a month ago he spoke along similar lines in Cleveland, in the United States. I will not repeat what he has said, but there are many who will, and his party is expected to do well in the elections in March.</p> <p>And yet what Mr Wilders shares in common with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Mr Trump</a>, Mr Orban, Mr Zeman, Mr Hofer, Mr Fico, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/marine-le-pen\">Madame Le Pen</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/nigel-farage\">Mr Farage</a>, he also shares with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/isis\">Da\u2019esh</a>.<br><br>All seek in varying degrees to recover a past, halcyon and so pure in form, where sunlit fields are settled by peoples united by ethnicity or religion \u2013 living peacefully in isolation, pilots of their fate, free of crime, foreign influence and war. A past that most certainly, in reality, did not exist anywhere, ever. Europe\u2019s past, as we all know, was for centuries anything but that. </p> <p>The proposition of recovering a supposedly perfect past is fiction; its merchants are cheats. Clever cheats.</p> <p>Populists use half-truths and oversimplification - the two scalpels of the arch propagandist, and here the internet and social media are a perfect rail for them, by reducing thought into the smallest packages: sound-bites; tweets. Paint half a picture in the mind of an anxious individual, exposed as they may be to economic hardship and through the media to the horrors of terrorism. Prop this picture up by some half-truth here and there and allow the natural prejudice of people to fill in the rest. Add drama, emphasising it\u2019s all the fault of a clear-cut group, so the speakers lobbing this verbal artillery, and their followers, can feel somehow blameless.</p> <p>The formula is therefore simple: make people, already nervous, feel terrible, and then emphasize it\u2019s all because of a group, lying within, foreign and menacing. Then make your target audience feel good by offering up what is a fantasy to them, but a horrendous injustice to others. Inflame and quench, repeat many times over, until anxiety has been hardened into hatred.</p> <p>Make no mistake, I certainly do not equate the actions of nationalist demagogues with those of Da\u2019esh, which are monstrous, sickening; Da\u2019esh must be brought to justice. But in its mode of communication, its use of half-truths and oversimplification, the propaganda of Da\u2019esh uses tactics similar to those of the populists. And both sides of this equation benefit from each other \u2013 indeed would not expand in influence without each others\u2019 actions.</p> <p>The humiliating racial and religious prejudice fanned by the likes of Mr Wilders has become in some countries municipal or even national policy. We hear of accelerating discrimination in workplaces. Children are being shamed and shunned for their ethnic and religious origins \u2013 whatever their passports, they are told they are not \u201creally\u201d European, not \u201creally\u201d French, or British, or Hungarian. Entire communities are being smeared with suspicion of collusion with terrorists.</p> <p>History has perhaps taught Mr Wilders and his ilk how effectively xenophobia and bigotry can be weaponised. Communities will barricade themselves into fearful, hostile camps, with populists like them, and the extremists, as the commandants. The atmosphere will become thick with hate; at this point it can descend rapidly into colossal violence.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/06/demagogues-and-cheats-un-human-rights-chief-condemns-trump-and-wilders\">'Demagogues and cheats': UN rights chief condemns Trump and Wilders</a> </p> </aside>  <p>We must pull back from this trajectory. My friends, are we doing enough to counter this cross-border bonding of demagogues? A decade ago, Geert Wilder\u2019s manifesto and Cleveland speech would have created a world-wide furore. Now? Now, they are met with little more than a shrug, and, outside the Netherlands, his words and pernicious plans were barely noticed. Are we going to continue to stand by and watch this banalisation of bigotry, until it reaches its logical conclusion? <br><br>Ultimately, it is the law that will safeguard our societies \u2013 human rights law, binding law which is the distillation of human experience, of generations of human suffering, the screams of the victims of past crimes and hate.

It is only by pursuing the entire truth, and acting wisely, that humanity can ever survive. So draw the line and speak.

His position in the internal power structure affords him a measure of protection when trouble strikes.</p> <p>But regardless of how this story ultimately ends, whether he toughs it out, or whether he doesn\u2019t, we can thank Dastyari for the following things.</p> <p>The first is, without even being conscious of it, senior players in the Coalition have lined up to make a compelling public case over the past few days that there is no such thing as money for nothing in politics.</p> <p>There has been a roster of frontbenchers, from the prime minister down, standing up with loudhailers to argue that Dastyari\u2019s conduct is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/02/sam-dastyaris-expenses-scandal-a-cash-for-comment-moment-says-turnbull\">an example of \u201ccash for comment\u201d</a>.</p> <p>Let\u2019s just think about this for a couple of minutes. The declared conduct from Dastyari involves payment of a $1,670.82 overspend and a $5,000 legal bill. For most Australians, me included, this is a lot of money.</p> <p>But, viewed in the context of all the money sloshing around in federal politics, the money these folks chase as a matter of routine, it\u2019s a drop in the ocean.</p> <p>So let\u2019s accept the government\u2019s logic at face value and persist with it.</p> <p>If one Labor senator can be influenced by a comparatively modest sum, there\u2019s an obvious follow-up question: what does millions buy you? Presumably more than $5,000-odd buys you. </p> <p>Perhaps it leads, for example, to Labor having to work for the best part of a year to try and herd cats on the China free-trade deal \u2013 the agreement the trade union movement didn\u2019t like.</p> <p>Perhaps, as some frank Coalition MPs have avowed publicly, what donors think becomes a live issue when the government is trying to formulate a superannuation policy that curbs tax breaks for high income earners.</p> <p>One could suggest that given circumstantial evidence is being deployed against Dastyari, maybe there is a double standard at play.</p> <p>These are just two recent examples, using the government\u2019s smoking gun logic, that might lead reasonable people to form a conclusion that millions from trade unions and from corporates to Labor and the Coalition may not be abstract bursts of charity.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/04/sam-dastyari-donation-legal-but-way-outside-voter-expectations-says-labor\">Sam Dastyari donation legal but 'way outside' voter expectations, says Labor</a> </p> </aside>  <p>So again, let\u2019s step through this, firmly in possession of the government\u2019s logic.</p> <p>Dastyari has done us all a favour by highlighting one problem in the current system: the capacity for foreign interests to try and assert influence in our democracy.</p> <p>But China\u2019s assertion of soft power isn\u2019t the only problem. By muscling up aggressively against Dastyari, the government has thrown open the door on a wider question, about institutional influence more generally.</p> <p>Institutional backers do influence policy outcomes in Canberra \u2013 it\u2019s just not something the major political parties generally like to acknowledge in polite company, lest people form a conclusion that their representative democracy isn\u2019t about them.</p> <p>So when the attorney general, George Brandis, goes on morning radio and argues reform of the donations regime is a \u201cdifferent conversation\u201d from the travails of Dastyari \u2013 he is dead wrong.</p> <p>Hiding behind a construction that this is an \u201cunconventional\u201d donation just doesn\u2019t cut it.</p> <p>If you\u2019ve got a problem with what Dastyari did \u2013 and we all should \u2013 you have a problem with institutional influence in Australian politics and, once you open that conversation up, it\u2019s impossible to build a rhetorical firewalls.

  "<p>A common criticism of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/amy-schumer\">Amy Schumer</a>\u2019s self-written 2015 movie blockbuster, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/aug/16/trainwreck-review-juicy-romcom\"><em>Trainwreck</em></a>, was that it got off to a good start before running out of steam. If that is true, the opposite can be said of the comic\u2019s debut book (\u201cnot a memoir,\u201d she insists).</p> <p>Schumer is right: <em>The Girl With the Lower Back Tattoo</em> is not a memoir but a collection of essays, listicles and vignettes: the latest in a long line of books from extremely smart, talented US comedians: Tina Fey, Chelsea Handler, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/sep/04/mindy-kaling-so-heres-whats-funny\">Mindy Kaling</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2015/dec/13/amy-poehler-interview-vanity-is-death-of-comedy\">Amy Poehler</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/lena-dunham\">Lena Dunham</a>. Though, of course, if you\u2019re in the market for hilarious books by brilliantly funny women, then Nora Ephron\u2019s work is the gold standard.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/aug/02/amy-schumer-interview-trainwreck-judd-apatow\">Meet comedian Amy Schumer, the sneaky feminist honesty bomb</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It\u2019s easy to see why Schumer\u2019s book is billed as \u201cconfessional\u201d \u2013 women\u2019s writing often is. It is still the case that when a woman writes or talks candidly, her words are viewed as confessional because of how long women\u2019s voices have been suppressed. But it\u2019s also often the writing women are pushed into \u2013 it\u2019s the business model of entire websites. But part of Schumer\u2019s huge success as a comedian \u2013 the ratings smash <a href=\"http://www.cc.com/shows/inside-amy-schumer\"><em>Inside Amy Schumer</em></a>; hosting MTV awards shows \u2013 is how well she skewers double standards. \u201cConfessional\u201d is a very gendered word. Can\u2019t we just call her honest?</p> <p>The book\u2019s title is a play on Stieg Larsson\u2019s <em>The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo</em> franchise. I hate titles like that. But we don\u2019t really get down to it until the last chapter and then it makes beautiful sense. Also, when I saw that the opening chapter was called An Open Letter to My Vagina, I sighed, because: a) who isn\u2019t sick of open letters? and b) we know a lot about Schumer\u2019s vagina and nothing can ever top her description of it in her HBO special as looking like \u201can old lounge singer\u2019s mouth\u201d.</p> <p>But, though the first 40 pages of <em>The</em> <em>Girl</em>\u2026 read as though an enterprising show runner has picked up some script notes on set and flogged them (there are too many zany asides and \u201canythiiiinnnnnnnnggggg\u201ds), the rest of this book is resoundingly brilliant.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YU2L5AUKtyc\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/YU2L5AUKtyc?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption><a href=\"https://youtu.be/YU2L5AUKtyc\">Inside Amy Schumer: One-Night Stand.</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Where it shines is in the jokes less told and scenes less sketched. The writing on her father\u2019s multiple sclerosis (which was given a subplot in <em>Trainwreck</em>) is both warm and devastating. \u201cI\u2019ve been mourning him while he\u2019s still alive,\u201d Schumer writes at one point of the gregarious, handsome man who struggles to find hope in recovery and who has, on more than one occasion, soiled himself in public. Then there\u2019s this on the last time the two ever went surfing together: \u201cWe waited for a good wave. That last wave we would ever ride together. When we saw it rolling in, we made eye contact and nodded to each other like musicians agreeing to play the bridge.\u201d</p> <p>I read that line three times over it was so good; I had to fish it out of my gut. Some of the prose on her dad\u2019s illness could rival Oliver Sacks or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jan/31/when-breath-becomes-air-paul-kalanithi-review\">Paul Kalanithi</a>. That\u2019s probably not what you were expecting.</p> <p>There\u2019s a chapter entitled How I Lost My Virginity. Not a wheeze about broken condoms and cramp, but an account of how Schumer lost her virginity to rape. A section is dedicated to two women who were shot and killed at a screening of her film. At the back of the book, she includes practical steps on how to help in the fight for gun control. This could all come across a bit Chris Martin, but it doesn\u2019t.</p> <p>But do not worry: there are laughs. Schumer is the kind of comedian who can casually drop bombs, \u00e0 la Sarah Silverman or Joan Rivers, speak about sex with a Pryor-like candour or be as physically funny as Lucille Ball. Her prose, too, is physical: it jumps and spins. (She would maybe tell you this is as close to playing sports as she gets.) There are offbeat observations. She describes a gym as \u201cjust for women \u2013 which we all know is code for sub-par\u201d.</p> <p>This might sound like an odd thing to write about a work by a comedian, but <em>The Girl\u2026</em> would still be a success if it wasn\u2019t funny, because it is so unashamed and human. It makes sense that Schumer selects Walt Whitman and Mark Twain as her favourite authors. (\u201cNo,\u201d she recalls a boyfriend saying when she gives the latter as the name of her dream best friend, \u201cit has to be a real person.\u201d)</p> <p>There are 35 chapters \u2013 one for each year of Schumer\u2019s life, though I understand why she talks as though she\u2019s 90. I am 27 and spent three hours last week Googling pension schemes, so I get it. In this world, if you are female and can\u2019t command \u00a35,000 per pre-roll ad for your YouTube makeup tutorials by 18, then it\u2019s over. However, Schumer\u2019s section of the book on her hustle, her decade-plus on the road performing and honing and crafting and sweating and learning how not to give a toss, is not a slog to read. It\u2019s inspiring, in the way that watching a great football game on TV can make you want to sign up for a team. Go seems to be the message of this book. Play, run, try. That\u2019s all you need to have won.</p> <p><em>The Girl With the Lower Back Tattoo is published by Harper Collins (\u00a320). </em><a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/girl-with-the-lower-back-tattoo.html?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\"><em>Click here to buy it for \u00a316.40</em></a></p>",

Classification should be independent of the IPC and the sport to take the pressure off the IPC. This would, however, be associated with a huge amount of cost.\u201d<br></p> <p>The classification process has come under the microscope following claims by athletes and coaches that it can be unfair. They say methods used by some competitors to fool the classifiers include claiming to be unable to use certain body parts and muscles, pretending to be less stable and coordinated, and deliberately exhausting themselves prior to assessment so that they temporarily appear less physically capable.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c252dea73b4a8f3b2a615f17a92f50141abd6099\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c252dea73b4a8f3b2a615f17a92f50141abd6099/0_8_3543_2126/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Paralympic torch is carried through the streets of Rio de Janeiro.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Paralympic torch is carried through the streets of Rio de Janeiro.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Miguel Schincariol/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The admissions follow the Guardian\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/02/inquiry-paralympic-classification-uk-athletics\">revelation</a> last week that UK Athletics (UKA), which oversees the classification of disabled athletes in Britain, is to conduct an inquiry into its procedures.</p> <p>It has been prompted after concerns were voiced, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/02/inquiry-paralympic-classification-uk-athletics\">including by the former Paralympic multiple gold medallist Tanni Grey-Thompson</a>, that some competitors were gaining an advantage by trying to appear less able that they are.</p> <p>Paralympic sport works by categorising competitors into different classes according to the level of their disabilities in an attempt to create a level playing field.</p> <p>Speaking on condition of anonymity, insiders have told the Guardian that although most athletes are correctly classified, some are not.</p> <p>One former athlete admitted: \u201cMy coach did train me pretty hard in the hours leading up to my classification to make my muscle fatigued and on the point of failure.\u201d</p> <p>She said that as a result of her appearing weak, the classifiers had suggested she might qualify for a more disabled class, but she resisted. \u201cLater in my career I wondered what would\u2019ve happened, but in the end I am thankful in my pride and I love that I have the strength to be as abled bodied as possible, not worse.\u201d</p> <p>She said her eyes had been opened to the motivations of some coaches. \u201cWhat you don\u2019t know as a young, impressionable athlete is that coaches and management are in positions of power. T hey know the ins and outs of classification and they get paid and are often under contract and are trying to win gold medals so that their job is safe or that they could possibly get a better job.\u201d</p> <p>Talking about the situation internationally, one current UK Paralympic coach claimed: \u201cTo be honest, the coaches don\u2019t try and make it easy for the classifiers. They tell their athletes to wobble more, that kind of thing.\u201d</p> <p>A former UKA official said: \u201cI have actually witnessed coaches telling athletes to do certain things to guarantee they will be classified in a certain way. I have seen coaches helping them to cheat. There are definitely coaches who do what is explicitly forbidden to cheat or misrepresent the abilities of their athletes.\u201d</p> <p>Another former UKA official said: \u201cSome coaches routinely tell their athletes to do things like claim they can\u2019t move their toes or other parts of their bodies.\u201d</p> <p>An IPC spokesman said: \u201cAthletes feigning impairment during classification is deemed as an extremely serious offence by the IPC and can lead to an athlete serving a suspension. </p> <p>\u201cIt should also be stressed that every single race in Paralympic sport is watched by a chief classifier and one of their roles is to observe competition and check athletes are in the correct class. If they believe an athlete is in the wrong class then the chief classifier can launch a protest under exceptional circumstances and the athlete in question would have to undergo reclassification.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u201cSo even if an athlete feigned impairment during classification it would be picked up by the chief classifier during competition.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"83d87b1ecb80cb2bc02c9c92a15fd3e0f319fc44\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/83d87b1ecb80cb2bc02c9c92a15fd3e0f319fc44/0_199_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Paralympics logo on Copacabana beach in Rio\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Paralympics logo on Copacabana beach in Rio, where the Paralympic Games open on Wednesday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Buda Mendes/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Eriksson said that he believed handing over classification to an independent body would improve things. \u201cI think the classification system is an ongoing process to improve. I think the classification organisation should be independent. I think we are inevitably going in that direction.\u201d</p> <p>He added: \u201cThe UK is doing the best job of any country in the world when it comes to getting classification correct. I don\u2019t believe there\u2019s cheating, but everyone can make a mistake. When I was in the UK, it was part of the system to make sure that everybody had the proper information \u2013 we had MRI scans and specialised neurological scans to make sure everyone is above board.\u201d</p> <p>Eriksson said it should be harder for athletes to get confirmed status, and athletes should be observed over a longer period of time before being permanently classified.</p> <p>The IPC spokesman said: \u201cClassification must be carried out by the sport\u2019s relevant international federation, as they have the sport specific skills and knowledge that are required to classify athletes in that particular sport. </p> <p>\u201cIt also needs to be remembered that international classification is undertaken by independent classification panels. This means that athletes cannot be internationally classified by classifiers from their own respective country. </p> <p>\u201cDepending on the impairment, many athletes who are classified internationally are placed under review status. This means that within 12 months they undergo a further classification assessment to validate whether they are in the correct class or not.\u201d</p>",

  "<p><strong>We\u2019ve never owned a television, but in recent times have taken to using the BBC\u2019s iPlayer catch-up service. As this now requires a licence from 1 September, I went online to buy one and opted for the \u201cpopular\u201d monthly direct debit. I was astounded to find that in the first year the BBC expects me to pay more than \u00a3230 in direct debit payments when the total licence fee is only \u00a3145.50, as the first five monthly payments are of \u00a329.50. </strong></p> <p><strong>The official website offers no explanation or justification for this overcharging. How can this \u201cnice little earner\u201d be justified? I was only made aware by a friend who teases us about being radio fiends. </strong><em>PM,</em><strong> </strong><em>London</em></p> <p>The direct debit options do incur a higher charge, but only for new customers such as yourself. A TV Licensing spokesperson said: \u201cNew customers choosing to pay by monthly direct debit pay for the first year\u2019s licence in six months. On this scheme, customers pay for their first licence over six months and thereafter pay half the fee for their [next] licence in advance and half in arrears, spreading the payment across 12 months. The total amount a person pays for their licence always adds up to the licence fee in force at the time of issue.</p> <p>\u201cTV Licensing wants to make it as easy as possible for people to pay for a TV licence, and there are a number of alternate ways people can pay, including annual direct debit, direct debit instalments, weekly or monthly cash payments. The amount and frequency of instalment payments the BBC can accept for the payment of TV licence fees are set by government.\u201d</p> <p>You\u2019ve since decided to pay the annual amount upfront, but this is a useful opportunity to bring the change in law to the attention of readers. From 1&#xa0;September 2016, you do indeed need to hold a TV licence to download or watch BBC programmes on demand \u2013 including catch-up \u2013 on BBC iPlayer.</p> <p>If people already have a licence, they will be covered automatically and don\u2019t need to do anything. The vast majority of people \u2013 around 95% \u2013 are already covered by a TV licence and so are unaffected by this change.

  "<h2><strong>Frederick \u2018Toots\u2019 Hibbert, singer-songwriter</strong></h2> <p>After independence in 1962, Jamaica had a new energy. Music started springing up all over the island. People told me I had a good voice, so after leaving school I practised in church, made my own guitar, then started doing gospel, ska and rocksteady.</p> <p>I came up with the name Maytals and worked with hot producers, such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2004/may/06/guardianobituaries.artsobituaries\">Coxsone Dodd</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Buster\">Prince Buster</a>. Then I was suddenly arrested and thrown in jail for a year. I don\u2019t like to talk about it \u2013 it wasn\u2019t a good period for me \u2013 but I was innocent. There was a lot of political stuff going on. People were doing bad things to each other.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnRWvVp15NM\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/NnRWvVp15NM?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>When I got out of jail, I had a sense of injustice and a desire to make up for lost time. Ideas just started flowing. One of my early songs, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbaaQTBOrZg\">Do the Reggay</a>, is credited with coining the name \u2013 later spelt reggae \u2013 for the new music that emerged as rocksteady slowed down even further. I got the name from ragamuffin, the term for people in Jamaica who didn\u2019t dress too good. The idea was that reggae was for everybody.</p> <p>Pressure Drop just came to me on guitar. It\u2019s a song about revenge, but in the form of karma: if you do bad things to innocent people, then bad things will happen to you. The title was a phrase I used to say. If someone done me wrong, rather than fight them like a warrior, I\u2019d say: \u201cThe pressure\u2019s going to drop on you.\u201d</p> <p>The song became very popular after it was used in the film <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/aug/20/how-made-harder-they-come\">The Harder They Come</a>. It\u2019s now been covered by everyone from the Specials to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyv16mZakVE\">the Clash</a>. That\u2019s great, an honour, although I haven\u2019t always been paid for everything that I have done.

He loves the kick of singing right there \u2013 as the music is playing, as if he\u2019s on stage. All the \u201cOh yeah yeah yeahs\u201d on Pressure Drop were done by the group live. It sounded riotous in the studio \u2013 and that\u2019s the vibe you hear on the record.</p> <p>In 1975, we supported the Who, playing to a crowd of 90,000 people in California.

  "<p>While you\u2019ve been weighing up whether to expand secondary modern education to the levels experienced when I was at school in the 1950s and 60s, I\u2019ve been thinking about what things are going to be like for someone aged eight now. Ahead of this person is 10 years of education redesigned by your party.</p> <p>This eight-year-old is likely to be sitting in class this week at a table with a name such as Squirrels. This disguises the fact that all the children know that Cheetahs table is for the kids getting everything right and Tortoise table is for those getting everything wrong. At&#xa0;frequent intervals, the eight-year-olds will be tested to see if they are on&#xa0;the right tables. Mostly they are. This&#xa0;keeps the attainment gap permanently wide.</p> <p>The eight-year-olds will spend a good deal of time practising doing the kind of public <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/may/03/morgan-sats-test-children-primary-school-pupils\" title=\"\">high-stakes tests they\u2019ll do when they\u2019re 11</a> (or nearly). By the time these eight-year-olds are 11, these tests may well have become even more difficult. You and your party call this \u201craising standards\u201d. The children on Tortoise table know that all it means is that it\u2019s less likely they\u2019ll pass.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/may/03/morgan-sats-test-children-primary-school-pupils\">Dear Ms Morgan: Sats tests are putting young children through hell</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The practice tests are worksheets, sometimes cunningly disguised as pages in booklets and given as homework. Some make sense. Some&#xa0;don\u2019t, as when they ask things such as \u201cunderline the present perfect progressive\u201d when nothing in the vicinity looks as if it\u2019s present, perfect or progressive.</p> <p>Having spent three years doing this, while useless things like reading for fun, painting, dancing, pottery, thinking, film-making, photography or going for a walk have been squeezed down to quick taster sessions, children do the tests.</p> <p>These aren\u2019t to measure children; they\u2019re to measure whether the teachers have taught the children the things that are in the tests. That\u2019s why it doesn\u2019t matter what\u2019s in the tests. It\u2019s any old stuff that they think they can measure but sounds something like the stuff they gave us when we did the 11-plus exam in 1957. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/feb/02/nicky-morgan-grammar-schools-secondary-selection\" title=\"\">That system was so good</a> it failed two-thirds of the children who did the exam. That was the point of it.</p> <p>The point now is that if enough children fail, the government will turn the child\u2019s school into an academy. This means that a bunch of people get the school on a 125-year-lease to run on the same site, but if they want to run a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/jan/26/sketch-margaret-hodge-academies-public-finances-committee\" title=\"\">dating agency</a> on site at the same time, they could give that a go, too. By the way, if too many children fail the test when it has become an academy, it will be turned into an \u2026 er \u2026 academy.</p> <p>Children now move on to another school. If they failed any of the tests, they may have to do them again. This is probably one step on the route towards bringing back the \u201cGymnasium\u201d system of 19th-century Europe, which kept children down for years.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/feb/02/nicky-morgan-grammar-schools-secondary-selection\">Dear Nicky Morgan: It\u2019s too easy to say grammar schools were good | Michael Rosen</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The first two years of secondary school may be the best out of the 10. That\u2019s because schools and teachers still have some control over what to do in this time. After that, the next three years will be preparing for exams that are now \u201cworld class\u201d. \u201cWorld class\u201d means \u201cpacked with more information than many children can understand or remember\u201d. Again, as with the tests for 11-year-olds, it really doesn\u2019t matter what much of this information is, so long as there\u2019s a lot of it, enough of it is \u201ctraditional\u201d \u2013 for example Wordsworth \u2013 and it can be broken down into small enough bits so that there are yes/no answers for it. This teaches students that life is made up of right or wrong facts; it\u2019s not about empathy, invention, investigation, experiment, interpretation, cooperation or change. There is only \u201cis\u201d, never \u201cmight be\u201d.</p> <p>This three years is also important because by the time students get to this point, they will only be able to choose one of the following: music, art, drama, dance, textiles or photography. That\u2019s because anyone who does, say, music <em>and </em>drama is unfit to make a contribution to society. When we watch TV or go to the cinema, is any of it dramatic <em>and</em> musical? Of&#xa0;course not.</p> <p>At the end of three years students will spend two weeks doing high-stakes exams that decide whether they can do A-levels or something else. The aim is that this is a final cutting of the cake.</p> <p>In the bad old days, people were allowed a second, third and fourth chance in \u201ctechs\u2019, further education and community colleges. Luckily, these are being closed and cut back. It\u2019s called giving everyone a chance to improve themselves.&#xa0;Not.</p> <p><strong>Yours, Michael Rosen</strong></p>",

A <a href=\"https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2016/07/egypt-hundreds-disappeared-and-tortured-amid-wave-of-brutal-repression/\">report by Amnesty International in July</a> found that children as young as 14 years old \u201cvanish without trace at the hands of the state\u201d. The report called forced disappearances, where the victim vanishes into a large security facility and is denied contact with their family or legal representation, \u201ca key instrument of state policy in Egypt\u201d.</p> <p>Hundreds of people are thought to be secretly held in the national security agency offices in Lazoghly Square, Cairo, inside the interior ministry building.</p> <h2>Local threats</h2> <p>This is not the first time Egyptians have created an app to counter state abuses.

  "<p>Britain\u2019s biggest police force is to allow its officers to use spit hoods on suspects within weeks, the Guardian has learned.</p> <p>The Metropolitan police say the restraint devices are necessary to protect officers from prisoners who try to spit at or bite them, exposing them to the risk of serious infection.<br></p> <p>The Met will start using them in 32 police station detention areas across London in a pilot scheme beginning in October. Initially they will not be used on the streets, where their deployment could be photographed or inflame the public.</p> <p>But their use may be expanded and they could be issued to officers on street patrol if the pilot scheme is deemed by Met bosses to be a success.</p> <p>The mesh hoods have proved controversial, and there have been claims that they <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2016/aug/29/uk-police-forces-under-pressure-to-stop-using-spit-hoods\">breach a suspect\u2019s rights</a>. The Met had previously opposed their use, and some police chiefs have privately expressed concerns that they are reminiscent of hoods used at Guant\u00e1namo Bay.</p> <p>The Met\u2019s decision was condemned by the human rights group Amnesty International, the civil rights group Liberty and the campaign group Inquest, which helps those who claim to have suffered at police hands.</p> <p>The Police Federation, which represents rank and file officers, has called for the use of the hoods to protect police. The Met calls the devices spit guards and says their deployment will be classed as a use of force by an officer.</p> <p>Martha Spurrier, director of Liberty, said: \u201cA spit hood is a primitive, cruel and degrading tool that inspires fear and anguish. We have seen many cases where the police use them unnecessarily and without justification, including on children and disabled people.</p> <p>\u201cPolice have the power to use force against citizens when they have to \u2013 using handcuffs, arm restraints, leg restraints, pepper spray, batons. The suggestion that officers need to be able to cover people\u2019s faces and heads is as far-fetched as it is frightening. Spit hoods belong in horror stories, not on the streets of a civilised society. We urge the Met police to think again.\u201d</p> <p>In a statement, the Metropolitan police service said: \u201cThe MPS does not currently use spit guards. A pilot scheme has been approved for the use of spit guards in all MPS custody units from October 2016. </p> <p>\u201cThese guards will only be used in a custody situation. They are considered a \u2018use of force\u2019 and so officers are being trained to ensure that their use is proportionate and necessary in the circumstances. The use of this protective equipment is necessary to meet the duty of care owed to officers when a detainee spits at or attempts to bite them.\u201d</p> <p>The Met did not rule out a greater use of spit hoods after the pilot.</p> <p>Deborah Coles, of Inquest, said: \u201cThis is an alarming development with seemingly no debate or consultation and will do nothing to assist police and community relations. </p> <p>\u201cThe use of a hood as a piece of police equipment is frightening and raises real concerns about its potential for misuse against the most vulnerable and discriminated against sections of society.\u201d</p> <p>Che Donald, the lead on health and safety for the Police Federation, said: \u201cI\u2019d rather take a punch to the face than be spat at.\u201d</p> <p>Spitting at officers can expose them to risks of contracting hepatitis, and such incidents have led to police taking powerful anti-viral drugs, which last for three months and can cause nausea.</p> <p>Donald said: \u201cWe do not deal with the most savoury people. Hepatitis is prevalent within the the drug abuse community. I don\u2019t see it as a use of force, it is a health and safety issue.\u201d</p> <p>Donald said spit hoods should be deployed on the streets of London, saying: \u201cIf it is working in custody, why would they not take it out on the street?\u201d</p> <p>Amnesty International said: \u201cSpit hoods can restrict breathing, create disorientation and can be dangerous and extremely distressing \u2026 Serious questions must be asked as to whether these restraints which have been criticised for breaching human rights guidelines should actually have a role in modern British policing.</p> <p>\u201cIt beggars belief that the Met police would choose to introduce these restraints in their toolkit, particularly given that so many other major British police forces have chosen to outlaw them.\u201d</p> <p>The use of spit hoods had until now be confined to smaller forces. British Transport police use them, and the force is under investigation by the police watchdog after a young black man was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jul/28/man-complains-after-police-place-spit-hood-over-head-during-arrest-london-bridge\">filmed being pinned to the floor and hooded by officers</a>.</p> <p>The footage was posted on social media and led to the investigation by the Independent Police Complaints Commission.</p>",
  "<p>The Saudi foreign minister is to brief British MPs personally to urge them not to ban UK arms sales to Saudi Arabia in light of UN claims that British weapons were used to conduct indiscriminate attacks in Yemen on hospitals, markets and cities.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>The Westminster briefing by Adel Al-Jubeir on Wednesday comes hours before the select committee on the control of arms exports meets to decide whether to call for a ban on arms sales, a move that would represent a seismic shift in Middle East policy.</p> <p>The foreign office minister, Tobias Ellwood, on Monday apologised to the Commons for inaccurate answers given by ministers. They said the government had assessed that the Saudis had not breached international humanitarian law in Yemen. He said the error, acknowledged just before the summer parliamentary recess in July, was not part of a plot to mislead of MPs.</p> <p>The foreign secretary, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/05/mps-to-urge-ban-on-uk-arms-sales-to-saudi-arabia\">Boris Johnson, also published a written statement to MPs insisting arms sales to Saudi Arabia could continue</a> because there was no evidence of a serious risk that the international humanitarian law would be violated if the UK continued to supply arms.</p> <p>Ellwood, brought to the Commons by the Speaker, John Bercow, to clarify the government position in light of Johnson\u2019s statement, said it was not for the UK government to conclude whether individual bombing incidents by the Saudis represented breaches of international humanitarian law (IHL), but instead to \u201ctake an overall view of the approach and attitude by Saudi Arabia to international humanitarian law\u201d.</p> <p>He said: \u201cWe are not acting to determine whether a sovereign state has or has not acted in the breach of IHL but instead \u2026 we are acting to make an overall judgment.\u201d It would not be possible for the UK to take a view on every bombing incident in a conflict to which the UK was not a party, Ellwood said.</p> <p>In his written parliamentary statement, Johnson said: \u201cAll export licence applications are assessed on a case-by-case basis against the Consolidated EU and National Arms Export Licensing Criteria, taking account of all relevant factors at the time of the application.</p> <p>\u201cThe key test for our continued arms exports to Saudi Arabia in relation to IHL is whether there is a clear risk that those weapons might be used in a commission of a serious violation of IHL.</p> <p>\u201cHaving regard to all the information available to us, we assess that this test has not been met.\u201d</p> <p>He added that he believed Saudi Arabia was best placed to investigate any allegations made against it of breaches of humanitarian law.</p> <p>In August a Saudi-led Joint Investigation Assessment team published a resume of an internal Saudi investigation into eight controversial bombing raids in Yemen, including attacks on hospitals, markets and cities. That inquiry exonerated the raids, largely on the grounds of acting on the basis of intelligence that enemy forces were in the area.</p> <p>Labour MPs described the contradictions in the government position as Kafkaesque, while the charity Oxfam said the government had a simple choice between complying with international law or remaining party to a war that has led to the death of thousands of Yemeni civilians.</p> <p>Stephen Doughty, a Labour MP on the arms controls committee, said: \u201cMinisters continue to be all over the place on whether violations of international humanitarian law have occurred in Yemen in light of Saudi Arabia admitting serious mistakes last month and that hospitals and World Food Programme convoys had been hit.</p> <p>\u201cIt is simply not good enough for ministers to rely on Saudi assurances on such serious matters where civilians have been targeted.\u201d</p> <p>Hilary Benn, the former shadow foreign secretary, called on the government \u201cto suspend sales until it had made a proper assessment and can explain to MPs why it believes IHL has not been breached in Yemen when the UN clearly says it has\u201d.</p> <p>He added the government had given no satisfactory explanation as to why it had consistently failed to provide accurate answers or explain why once errors were identified, ministers took 27 days to inform MPs of them.</p> <p>Ellwood conceded the Saudis had moved slowly to conduct the investigations and it would be a major step forward if the country signed the international treaty banning the use of cluster munitions. He said a future Saudi inquiry would look into whether it had been using cluster munitions in its bombing campaign, as has been alleged by some charities.<br></p> <p>Defending the Saudi response to criticisms of its campaign, Ellwood said: \u201cIt was new territory for Saudi Arabia and a conservative nation was not used to such exposure.\u201d<br></p> <p>In a sign that the dissent was spreading to Conservative benches, five Tory MPs also criticised the Saudi approach, but Ellwood said errors in targeting were always possible in the midst of thousands of air sorties.</p> <p>The Campaign Against the Arms Trade said the UK had licensed more than \u00a33.3bn worth of arms sales to Saudi Arabia since the bombing of Yemen began in March 2015.</p> <p>The Saudi campaign is designed to drive back Houthi resistance to the elected government of Yemen and has the support of UN resolutions.</p>",

  "<p>In 2017, several months after the United States swears in a new president, the Israeli occupation of Palestinian lands will turn 50 years old. Some birthdays ought not to be celebrated, however. Through its occupation, Israel continues to colonize territory in the West Bank and further entrench its military rule, with no sign of it ending. American politicians may not want to face this reality, but the situation is dire, leading Jay Michaelson of The Forward to <a href=\"http://forward.com/opinion/348267/if-israels-occupation-is-permanent-why-isnt-it-the-same-as-apartheid/\">write</a>: \u201cAs a temporary policy, the occupation is unjust. As a permanent one, it is apartheid.\u201d</p> <p>Luckily, both Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton have good, workable solutions to this most intractable of problems. Just kidding. Although the entire world knows that a durable resolution to the conflict is imperative, not in the interests of justice but also in the pursuit of peace in the region, the American presidential candidates have about as much to offer peace in the Middle East as New Coke and Crystal Pepsi offered to the future of carbonated beverages.</p> <p>Unsurprisingly, Donald Trump doesn\u2019t seem to know where he stands, but he\u2019ll stand there vehemently. In January 2013, Trump recorded a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tm5Je73bYOY&amp;feature=youtu.be\">video</a> endorsing rightwing Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s run for prime minister, but by December 2015, Trump <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://bigstory.ap.org/article/0e098fa7e6ec4900b08efad80c15348a/ap-conversation-trump-calls-mideast-peace-toughest-deal\">told</a> the Associated Press that he would be \u201cneutral\u201d when negotiating a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians, and he questioned \u201cwhether or not Israel\u2019s willing to sacrifice certain things\u201d to come to an agreement.</p> <p>But then, by March 2016, Trump was again changing positions. He <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/videos/us/2016/03/21/donald-trump-aipac-israel-hillary-clinton-sot-tsr.cnn\">said</a> that \u201cit\u2019s probably not possible\u201d to be neutral and by May, he <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3571403/Trump-insists-Israel-building-West-Bank-settlements-says-Netanyahu-moving-forward-Palestinians-fired-thousands-missiles-Jewish-state.html\">told</a> the Daily Mail that Israel should \u201ckeep moving forward\u201d with new settlement construction in the West Bank, thereby flouting five decades of stated (though completely ineffectual) US policy.</p> <p>It doesn\u2019t stop there. Come June, Trump\u2019s co-adviser on Israeli affairs, David Friedman, told the Israeli newspaper <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-1.726779\">Haaretz</a> that Trump would probably support annexing parts of the West Bank and that a Palestinian state is not \u201can American imperative at all\u201d, with Friedman asserting that he\u2019s also unconcerned about a binational state because \u201cnobody really knows how many Palestinians live there\u201d.</p> <p>In fact, there are 2,898,927 Palestinians living in the West Bank, 1,850,559 in the Gaza Strip, 1,471,201 in Israel, and a total of 12,365,761 worldwide (end of <a href=\"http://www.pcbs.gov.ps/Downloads/book2188.pdf\">2015</a> figures), according to the reputable Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics.</p> <p>Even the rabidly rightwing Breitbart News \u2013 now completely aligned with the Trump campaign \u2013 links to a source <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.breitbart.com/tag/palestinian-bureau-of-statistics/\">citing</a> the Palestinian statistics bureau. So when Trump\u2019s adviser says nobody really knows, he must mean Trump doesn\u2019t know. Trump is nobody.</p> <p>And then there\u2019s Hillary Clinton, a politician who seems never to have met a war she won\u2019t vote for. Her bellicose <a href=\"http://time.com/4265947/hillary-clinton-aipac-speech-transcript/\">speech</a> in front of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (Aipac) last March promised not a new solution to the conflict but rather a shield for Israel from global pressure and nonviolent opposition movements over Israel\u2019s actions and illegal settlement activity. The <a href=\"https://www.demconvention.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Democratic-Party-Platform-7.21.16-no-lines.pdf\">final</a> Democratic party platform isn\u2019t much better on the issue. It repeats language similar to Clinton\u2019s Aipac speech, declaring that Israelis \u201cdeserve security\u201d (and Palestinians don\u2019t?), while Palestinians \u201cshould be\u201d rather than \u201cmust be\u201d free to govern themselves. As a practiced diplomat, Clinton surely knows that such word choices matter.</p> <p>When Democratic party leaders were negotiating the 2016 platform, the Bernie Sanders wing of the party proposed an amendment calling for \u201can end to occupation and illegal settlements\u201d. This internationally recognized position was considered too \u201c<a href=\"http://foreignpolicy.com/2016/06/29/inside-the-democratic-partys-showdown-over-israel-palestine/\">one-sided</a>\u201d for the party establishment, and the amendment was <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/07/09/politics/democratic-platform-israel-palestine-hillary-clinton-bernie-sanders/\">defeated</a> by a vote of 73-95, though the final draft twice mentions that Palestinians ought to be able to live in \u201cdignity\u201d. The Republican Party <a href=\"https://prod-static-ngop-pbl.s3.amazonaws.com/media/documents/DRAFT_12_FINAL%5b1%5d-ben_1468872234.pdf\">platform</a>, meanwhile, is zealously anti-Palestinian and basically off in its own world. It states that the party \u201crejects the false notion that Israel is an occupier\u201d, and describes the completely nonviolent Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions movement as one of several \u201calternative forms of warfare\u201d being waged upon Israel. So there\u2019s that.</p> <p>Party platform statements don\u2019t mean much in the end, and these reflect more how the Democrats are sticking to a tired status quo framed by the 1993 Oslo Accords and the Republicans are spinning hard to the right. Neither position offers anything that shows that they truly understand the reality of the situation.</p> <p>According to the New York Times, there are <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/03/12/world/middleeast/netanyahu-west-bank-settlements-israel-election.html\">now</a> more than 350,000 settlers living in the West Bank and another 300,000 living in East Jerusalem, greater than double the number since the Oslo Accords were signed and still in violation of the Fourth Geneva Convention, which prohibits an occupying power from transferring its citizens into territory it controls or displacing those who live there. Around 60% of West Bank land, dubbed Area C under Oslo, is under exclusive Israeli control. And the thriving business of settlement enterprises further dispossesses Palestinians, as Human Rights Watch recently <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2016/01/19/occupation-inc-how-settlement-businesses-contribute-israels-violations-palestinian\">documented</a>. Some Palestinians who have lost their own businesses or farms due to Israeli land confiscations, discriminatory regulations, or water deprivations are then left with no choice but to work for the very businesses that displaced them in the first place.</p> <p>Palestinian citizens of Israel struggle under a <a href=\"http://www.adalah.org/en/content/view/7771\">system</a> that accords them fewer rights and opportunities than their Jewish counterparts. And regardless of what one thinks of Hamas, the siege that Israel imposes (with Egyptian collusion) on Gaza affects all of its inhabitants and is unconscionable. According to the Israeli organization <a href=\"http://gisha.org/\">Gisha</a>, over 70% of Gaza\u2019s population relies on humanitarian aid, while 47% suffer from food insecurity. In the second quarter of 2016, unemployment was at 41.7%, and at a staggering 57.6% among young people.</p> <p>Nothing in the current situation excuses the abhorrent and immoral attacks on civilians, whether coming from Palestinians or Israelis, and any lasting solution must work to guarantee peace and security for everyone.</p> <p>But the precarious situation of today is a consequence and not a contradiction of the 1993 Oslo Accords, and it\u2019s high time we recognize that the Oslo Accords are as likely to bring peace to the Middle East as Donald Trump is to unite America. From its conception, Oslo never required Israel to recognize Palestinian rights to statehood and has instead enabled Israeli encroachment on the West Bank. Over 20 years ago, Edward Said predicted that the accords would establish the Palestinian Authority not as a sovereign government of the Palestinians but as \u201c<a href=\"http://www.lrb.co.uk/v15/n20/edward-said/the-morning-after\">Israel\u2019s enforcer</a>\u201d of the occupation. I was a student of Edward Said\u2019s then, and I clearly remember the loneliness from which he objected to the agreement along with his refusal to attend the White House signing ceremony out of principle. At the time, he was considered an obstructionist outlier. History has only proven him right.</p> <p>The next president of the United States must recognize the folly of current approaches and seek new solutions. Until now, the international consensus has been focused on a state-oriented resolution as a way to confer rights and stability to Palestinians and Israelis. But what if that equation were flipped, if the focus were instead on enshrining full equality for everyone before even considering the creation of two states? A new administration ought to concentrate on mechanisms (including withholding aid) geared to guaranteeing the human rights of all the people living between the Mediterranean Sea and the Jordan river, along with ways to preserve the communal rights of each of the communities.</p> <p>Whether the result of such an approach leads to one state or two states or 21 states on the land is immaterial. (In fact, slim majorities of both Palestinians and Israelis still <a href=\"http://bigstory.ap.org/article/dae99c74e08a4c4082e8c2387ad656d8/poll-shows-most-israelis-palestinians-still-seek-peace\">support</a> a two-state solution.) What matters is that we finally wake from the 23-year-old slumber induced by Oslo, the numbing half-century of occupation, and the nearly 70 years of Palestinian dispossession, to see that the only durable resolution to this conflict will be one that protects Israelis and Palestinians equally, with liberty and justice for all. </p>",

When it did arrive, the nine-page, 7,000-word communiqu\u00e9 offered few insights.</p> <p>It was arranged around five themes: policy co-ordination; innovative economic growth; financial and economic governance; trade and investment; and development.</p> <p>The communiqu\u00e9 reflected the increasingly complex and technical language of G20 officials. Combined with its lack of concrete and measurable actions, the communiqu\u00e9 provides a clear signal that G20 leaders gained little collective ground during the summit.<br></p> <p>Recognising that economic growth has been too slow for too long and for too few, the communiqu\u00e9 does set out an agreed longer-term vision for the G20. This so-called \u201cHangzhou Consensus\u201d calls on the G20 to deliver more inclusive economic growth through co-ordinated macroeconomic policy, open trade and innovation. In short, it reaffirms the group\u2019s core mandate: to make globalisation work for the benefit of all.</p> <p>The consensus is followed by a raft of vague commitments for action. Ranging from innovation and the \u201cnew industrial revolution\u201d, to issues of business financing, international tax avoidance, anti-corruption measures, open trade and implementation of the sustainable development goals, the commitments fall short of expectations.</p> <p>Little real progress was made on key issues of climate change and energy. Other challenges that consumed the attention and energy of leaders on the sidelines, including co-ordinated responses to the Syrian crisis, refugees, terrorism and migration, remain unresolved.</p> <p>For Australia an underwhelming G20 outcome is not a bad outcome.<br></p> <p>Australia\u2019s low-key objectives to strengthen moves against international tax avoidance, to boost confidence in global trade and open markets, and to highlight innovation as a driver of economic growth were largely met.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/05/g20-chinese-newspaper-claims-western-media-hyped-up-obama-snub\">Chinese newspaper claims western media 'hyped up' Obama G20 snub</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Sideline meetings with India\u2019s prime minister, Narendra Modi, and the United Kingdom\u2019s prime minister, Theresa May, point to positive bilateral prospects.

In today\u2019s complex and complicated world the opportunity for leaders to sit together at the G20 table is not to be underestimated.</p> <p>Ultimately, though, G20 success is a matter of perspective. For many, the Hangzhou G20 has fallen decidedly short on substance. For others, it continued the incremental business of global economic governance.

  "<p>A few weeks ago, I was representing the Guardian at a media industry news quiz. It was neck and neck, and then the question came: who is the captain of the Australian netball team? I gasped. My eyes widened. I blushed. Lauren, something \u2026 I said quietly, without confidence. My two teammates didn\u2019t know. The other team didn\u2019t know. The host opened it up to the audience of about 100 people. In a room full of journalists, not a single person knew.</p> <p>If this had been asked at any point in my primary school years, I would have known and shouted out: <a href=\"http://www.annesargeant.com.au/about-anne/\">Anne Sargeant! </a> She was my hero. Later Sargeant was replaced by <a href=\"http://www.lizellis.com.au/\">Liz Ellis</a>. As a kid I played netball and watched netball on TV. Sometimes, a group of girls from my netball team and their mums would go to an elite match as a group party. We played netball, it was our sport, of course we wanted to be fans of netball, too.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/dec/09/ellyse-perry-its-the-most-exciting-time-in-womens-cricket\">Ellyse Perry: 'It's the most exciting time in women's cricket' | Russell Jackson</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This is why I have to apologise to my sports colleagues at the Guardian. Because \u2013 despite some years of going backwards \u2013 there has been some progress in netball. New sponsors, new TV rights and a massive potential audience mean netball is back in the spotlight, almost. I\u2019ve watched our sports editor and his team try their hardest to get netball on the homepage. I read the World Cup stories, played with the interactive features and \u2013 yes! \u2013 I have seen the captain of the Australian netball team, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/27/laura-geitz-says-new-scoring-zones-would-alter-whole-concept-of-netball\">Laura Geitz</a>, on the front of the Guardian\u2019s website.<br></p> <p>But here\u2019s the thing. You can\u2019t have a fanbase without fanfare. Investment in women\u2019s sport cannot be treated as a short-term offering or a one-off. It will take time to build a fanbase. It takes time for fans to learn the names of their teams, and their favourite players. Fans will only invest their energy en masse in a sport they can rely on. They need to be able to come back to it week after week. Being a fan is a hobby as much as being a player. It takes time to get good at it. News from the sport needs to bubble into conversations on the playground, in the office, at home or at the pub with mates.<br></p> <p>And that\u2019s why one news organisation or a singular sport can\u2019t do it alone.<br></p> <p>There is no lack of evidence that long-term investment will pay off, or that the public is willing to watch, enjoy and even rejoice in women\u2019s sports and players.<br></p> <p>In Australia, we\u2019re lucky to have a long list of inspirational female sports heroes, not least of whom is the extraordinary <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/dec/09/ellyse-perry-its-the-most-exciting-time-in-womens-cricket\">Ellyse Perry</a>, a star in the national team in both cricket and football. But I would argue that Perry has not yet received her due in sustained media attention, and that is no fault of her own but down to the subverted platform of the sports she plays \u201cas a woman\u201d. I would say the same about other inspirational female athletes such as, Geitz, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://stephgilmore.com/\">Stephanie Gilmore</a>, and <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/mar/26/australian-sally-fitzgibbons-through-to-quarter-finals-at-bells-beach\">Sally Fitzgibbon</a>.

The games began with the American <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/13/katie-ledecky-swimming-2016-dominant-athlete\">Katie Ledecky</a> absolutely smashing it in the pool. But there is no doubt that the emerging star of Rio was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/03/simone-biles-gymnastics-america-rio-2016\">Simone Biles</a>, a 19-year-old whose talent almost defies logic. In the gymnastics world, of course, her success was no surprise but for the rest of us who are only gymnastic-obsessives once every four years, she was a rising star.<em> </em>Leaving Rio with four gold medals and a bronze medal (only topped by Ledecky, with four gold medals and a silver, and Michael Phelps with five golds and a silver) \u2013 Biles\u2019 success is almost unprecedented. </p> <p>How many little girls enrolled in their local gymnastics school after watching the extraordinary athleticism of Biles on the telly at night? How many little girls already doing gymnastics suddenly saw their weekly class less as a bit of fun and more as training for a career? </p> <p>And how many myths about what it means to be feminine were smashed by the dazzling display of Biles\u2019 body strength and control? How many girls who choose Biles as a hero are saved from the myth that a girl has to be a waif to be attractive? How many girls who watch Biles will never believe that it\u2019s a good thing to be weak \u2013 or worse \u2013 to be pretend to be weak?

Williams is that she is lucky to play a sport where women are granted exposure. Four times a year, every year, young girls (and boys) get to see women battling it out on the tennis court in the same competition as men. OK, sometimes they are asked to twirl or about their dating life rather than their game, but there they are, household names, playing and winning. And that is one of the reasons why Williams\u2019 impact has gone so far beyond the sport of tennis. Her effect on young black women cannot be overestimated.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>While she was playing at Wimbledon this year, two black men, Philando Castile and Alton Sterling, were shot by police in America. After Williams won that tournament, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/12/serena-williams-champion-black-female-power-black-lives-matter\">she raised her fist</a> in an act <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/mar/30/black-power-salute-1968-olympics\">that was described as reminiscent of John Carlos\u2019s black power salute at the 1968 Olympics</a>.</p> <p>The conversations sparked by Williams and Biles are the best illustration of why supporting women\u2019s sport is so important. Heroes like them emerge when they are granted a platform by society. But grand slam tennis and the Olympic Games are giant platforms and they are too few and far between in Australia.</p> <p>The examples of these two remarkable women show that when the world is exposed to female champions, it is not just sports and sponsors who benefit, but all of society. The issue is too important to try short-term strategies. The sports and the players are there, an audience awaits. What is needed is the platform, and that can only exist with the media, sports and sponsors acting together.</p> <p><em>This article is based on a speech given to a seminar on gender equality in sport, held by M&amp;C Saatchi S&amp;E and the Guardian in Sydney </em></p>",

  "<p>Of the eight players left in the men\u2019s draw of the 2016 US Open, Andy Murray has hit the highest pitch of excellence \u2013 and the fastest serve of his life \u2013 in allowing Grigor Dimitrov only five games in two hours of exhilarating tennis. </p> <p>The Scot\u2019s 141 mile-an-hour rocket on the eighth evening of the tournament was one of nine aces he put past the bewildered Bulgarian, who barely got into the match at any point. On Wednesday Murray plays the sixth seed and former finalist Kei Nishikori, who earlier put out the veteran Ivo Karlovic in three tough sets.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/05/serena-williams-us-open-record-grand-slam-win\">Serena Williams sets grand slam record in reaching US Open quarter-finals</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Murray said courtside: \u201cI served 145 in San Jose once, but the next day they recalibrated the gun because it was completely wrong. I think I was lucky. I\u2019ve never hit over 140 before. I don\u2019t expect to do it again.\u201d</p> <p>He was consistently 10 miles an hour faster than Dimitrov on serve, and happily paid the price of five double faults as the world No22 floundered in the face of the unstoppable blizzard. Many of Murray\u2019s biggest serves hit 135 miles and more.</p> <p>\u201cTactically I played a good match,\u201d he said. \u201cI served very well when I got behind, very few unforced errors. I enjoy it in here [on Arthur Ashe Court], fantastic atmosphere. Tonight is the first night it\u2019s been a little bit windy.</p> <p>\u201cKei has been to the final here, we\u2019ve had bunch of tough matches. I played a good match against him a few weeks ago [in the semi-finals of the Olympics en route to the gold medal] and I\u2019ll need to play like that again.\u201d</p> <p>The novelty of looking up and seeing his old friend and coach Dani Vallverdu in his opponent\u2019s box has worn off for Murray (the sought-after Venezuelan has joined Dimitrov after spells with Tomas Berdych and Juan Mart\u00edn del Potro), but there will have been at least a suspicion that he had devised a canny plan for him. If so, it was not immediately apparent.</p> <p>Dimitrov hit hard and flat to grab two break points inside the first two minutes but, within a quarter of an hour, the world No2 gradually began to make the gap between them in the rankings apparent.</p> <p>Which is no slight on Dimitrov. He has picked up his level noticeably in recent weeks and played some excellent tennis to beat the talented Portuguese Jo\u00e3o Sousa in four sets two days ago when Murray was having problems with the 34-year-old Italian Paolo Lorenzi. Yet he was not remotely on form in this one-sided fourth-round match.</p> <p>Dimitrov botched the simplest of smashes to drop serve in the fourth game, and Murray hit the accelerator. His serve, which went missing for two sets against Lorenzi, clicked to pleasing effect, and there was little his opponent could do to get back into the contest.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6463674b902d1a52d78d0c9df91e44beb1c7d923\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6463674b902d1a52d78d0c9df91e44beb1c7d923/0_597_3942_2364/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Andy Murray\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Andy Murray was consistently 10mph faster than Grigor Dimitrov on his serve.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Adam Hunger/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A wondrous backhand down the line took him to 5-1 and, on the half-hour, he served out to 15 with his third ace, that 141mph howitzer, which beat the 139mph serve he sent down in Cincinnati five years ago. Even if the speed gun was telling fibs, the ball hit the back wall like a bullet.</p> <p>A new set can often invigorate a player on the wrong end of the scorecard, but Dimitrov, hitting fiercely but without discipline, won only a single point on his first serve. If his strategy was to hit his way out of trouble, it was bone-headed against such an outstanding defender and he\u2019d bludgeoned his way to 0-3, to go eight games without success.</p> <p>The crowd, keen for entertainment, urged Dimitrov on and, in spasms, he produced some wondrous passages of play; but not many of them added up to much.</p> <p>He was glad of a loose Murray forehand to break back, but a double-fault immediately returned the favour. He hung on through a break point and deuce to hold in the eighth game, but there was no avoiding the relentless Murray tidal wave of shots.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/05/novak-djokovic-us-open-2016-jo-wilfried-tsonga\">Novak Djokovic defends fitness before US Open test against  Jo-Wilfried Tsonga</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The second set lost, Dimitrov was under pressure instantly at the start of the third. In 120 matches in slams, Murray has never lost after winning the first two sets; Dimitrov has never beaten anyone from two sets down. As John McEnroe observed, \u201cDimitrov is giving off the vibe out there of, \u2018I don\u2019t know what I am doing.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Murray did, though. When he chased down a perfectly respectable down-the-line forehand and thrashed it crosscourt for 3-0, Dimitrov could do no more than look on in wonder.</p> <p>Darren Cahill, who briefly coached Murray, said, \u201cIn 10 years, I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ve seen him serve better or move better. Absolutely flawless.\u201d</p> <p>Vallverdu\u2019s thoughts went unrecorded. He no doubt was happy enough for his old mate, if not for his new employer.</p> <p>There was a final minor twist. \u201cThis has been such a blowout, the sky is crying,\u201d McEnroe quipped as rain fell just as Murray was about to step up at 5-2 to serve for a place in the quarter-finals, his sixth on the spin here. They chose not to close the roof \u2013 and Murray completed the job when he forced a 43<sup>rd</sup> unforced error from Dimitrov, a wayward backhand. It pretty much summed up his wretched evening.</p>",
  "<p>For nearly a decade I was a Labor MP in the NSW parliament. One of the very first things I learned was that we were never, ever, ever permitted to leave the parliament without the whip\u2019s approval. It didn\u2019t matter if you were attending your mother\u2019s funeral or popping out for dinner, if the whip hadn\u2019t signed you out, you weren\u2019t going anywhere. </p> <p>For a year or so after retiring from politics, I would still get the urge to call the whip\u2019s office and ask if it was OK to duck out for a coffee or a sandwich.</p> <p>For the life of me, I can\u2019t understand how the Turnbull government, with just a one-seat majority, seemed to have no process in place to ensure that it could always win a vote on the floor of the parliament. And boo-hoo to those Coalition MPs who are calling Labor\u2019s parliamentary tactics, like moving a motion just before parliament finishes, a \u201cstunt\u201d.

You bet I am.</p> <p>Speaking of Tony Abbott, sources close to the former PM told my Sky News colleague Peter van Onselen \u2013 via a text message sent while we were live on air, no less \u2013 that, as prime minister, if he had to be away from parliament, Mr Abbott always had a pair. (And by that, I mean a registered and excused absence, reciprocated by the opposition). </p> <p>Mr Abbott didn\u2019t miss a vote on Thursday afternoon either. Malcolm Turnbull did miss a vote. Turnbull missed the 4.15 division, which the government won by one vote. Subsequent inquiries confirmed two things: one, that Turnbull was giving a speech at the time, and two, that Turnbull didn\u2019t have a pair.</p> <p>Makes you think. </p> <p>You know what else Abbott and his treasurer Joe Hockey could do that their successors Turnbull and Morrison can\u2019t? Maths. </p> <p>Yep, say what you will about the 2014 budget of horrors, but one thing you can\u2019t say is that it didn\u2019t add up. The measures were woeful and unfair and now destined to exist as zombies, not allowed to live, but not able to be killed off by their creators.</p> <p>But the maths was correct.</p> <p>Not so for Messrs Turnbull and Morrison. What a pair these two are. Their omnibus savings bill \u2013 their big idea, their big stab at budget savings, their big stick to whack at the opposition \u2013 didn\u2019t add up. It was off by $107m! And this wasn\u2019t some buried detail on page 362. This was in a summary table on page five. Page five! </p> <p>Let\u2019s consider how many eyes in the Turnbull government supposedly reviewed this bill: treasurer Morrison and his staff; the prime minister and his staff; the cabinet, who would have approved it; the Coalition party room, who would have approved it.</p> <p>Apparently none of these people own calculators. Or read beyond page four.</p> <p>It took the opposition\u2019s economic team, led by Jim Chalmers and Chris Bowen, less than a day to find the $107m error. In fact, the opposition noticed it the night before in a draft of the legislation they were provided by the government, and just assumed it was a typo that would be fixed in the final legislation. </p> <p>It was that unfathomable to the opposition that the government, with all those eyes looking at its legislation, had actually made a \u201ccomputational error\u201d. But that\u2019s exactly what Morrison called it the next day after he was forced to admit the mistake \u2013 a computational error. This may make Scott Morrison the first treasurer in Australian history to openly acknowledge that maths is not his strong suit.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/01/on-political-donations-canberra-is-sleepwalking-into-its-own-integrity-crisis\">On political donations, Canberra is sleepwalking into its own integrity crisis | Katharine Murphy</a> </p> </aside>  <p>One person who can add up fairly accurately is Labor senator Sam Dastyari.
