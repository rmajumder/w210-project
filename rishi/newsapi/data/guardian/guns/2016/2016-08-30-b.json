  "<p> MPs are demanding urgent government action to tackle a \u201cshocking and unacceptable\u201d rise in workplace discrimination in the UK against expectant and new mothers over the last decade.</p> <p>A report published by the women and equalities select committee called for Britain to put in place protection similar to that in Germany, where pregnant women can only be made redundant in certain circumstances. <br></p> <p>The MPs also expressed concern for casual, agency and zero-hours workers, who they said were more likely to report risks to their health and safety, and more likely to leave their employer because of those risks not being resolved. The government should review the maternity and pregnancy rights of this group, they said.</p> <p>The report, published on Wednesday, recommended individual risk assessments, to help reduce the number of women, 25%, who left their jobs because health and safety concerns regarding pregnancy and maternity were not met.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2015/jun/12/discrimination-work-pregnant-new-mothers-forced-out-jobs\">Workplace discrimination: when a pregnant pause becomes more long-term</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The committee chair, Maria Miller, said: \u201cThe arrival of a new baby puts family finances under extreme pressure yet, despite this, thousands of expectant and new mothers have no choice but to leave their work because of concerns about the safety of their child or pregnancy discrimination. Shockingly, this figure has almost doubled in the last decade, now standing at 54,000 each year.</p> <p>\u201cThere are now record numbers of women in work in the UK. The economy will suffer unless employers modernise their workplace practices to ensure effective support and protection for expectant and new mums.\u201d <br></p> <p>She criticised the government\u2019s response to its own findings in March, which showed that pregnancy discrimination, which is illegal, was worse now than in 2005. </p> <p>\u201cThe government\u2019s approach has lacked urgency and bite,\u201d Miller said. \u201cIt needs to set out a detailed plan outlining the specific actions it will take to tackle this unacceptable level of discrimination. This work must be underpinned by concrete targets and changes to laws and protections to increase compliance by employers to improve women\u2019s lives.\u201d</p> <p>Currently, 77% of pregnant women and new mothers <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/mar/22/fifth-of-women-harassed-at-work-over-pregnancy-or-flexible-hours-report-finds\">experience discrimination at work</a>, compared with 45% 10 years ago and 11% lost their jobs, according to the study by the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, and the Equality and Human Rights Commission in March.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u201cWe find it shocking that the number of new and expectant mothers feeling forced out of their job has nearly doubled in the past decade,\u201d the report on Wednesday said. \u201cIt is difficult to accept the EHRC\u2019s characterisation of this as solely an issue of misinterpretation of the law.\u201d<br></p> <p>The report recommended greater protections, including changes in the law, paid time off for antenatal appointments for all workers, and a reduction in the current fee of \u00a31,200 to take a case to a tribunal, which discourages those discriminated against to seek justice.</p> <p>In Germany, a dismissal ban prevents redundancies for pregnant employees except in rare cases, such as gross misconduct by the worker, or the employer getting into severe financial difficulties resulting in multiple job losses. </p> <p>Pregnancy discrimination in the UK is present across all industries and income brackets, studies have found. However, differences do exist. For instance, those on low incomes tend to face discrimination when pregnant, while those on higher incomes tend to experience discrimination on their return to work.</p> <p>A recent survey of Mumsnet users found <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.mumsnet.com/jobs/the-employers-who-wont-hire-women-mumsnet-survey-women-attitudes\">a fifth of mothers had been asked at a job interview how they would manage childcare</a> if they got the job.</p> <p>Rosalind Bragg, the director of Maternity Action, who gave evidence to the committee, described the report as a roadmap to help tackle the issue.</p> <p> Implementing its recommendations could \u201creverse the increase in discrimination\u201d and move towards a situation where pregnancy discrimination was rare, she said.</p> <p>Elizabeth Duff, a senior policy adviser for the National Childbirth Trust, said: \u201cWomen in the 21st century should never fear making the choice between having a career and a family. Action to address this mistreatment is long overdue.\u201d </p> <p>Catherine Rayner, of the Discrimination Law Association, told the committee the rise in the number of women in casual, agency and zero-hours work might be one reason for the doubling of discrimination.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u201cThere are huge swaths of women, particularly in some of the caring industries, who are treated not as employees but as workers and therefore do not necessarily access the (same) rights.\u201d </p> <p>The birthrights organisation said poorer women were at the greatest risk of having a stillbirth, dying in childbirth or suffering complications. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u201cIt is vital that the law protects these women \u2013 some of whom are in casual, agency work or on zero-hours contracts where they are unable to access protected time for vital antenatal appointments. <br></p> <p>\u201cIf vulnerable women cannot attend antenatal appointments because of concerns about missing work, this may put them and their babies at serious risk.\u201d</p> <p>The EHRC\u2019s deputy chair, Caroline Waters, said the commission was pleased the committee had adopted its recommendations to improve access to justice, \u201ccalling for an extension on the three-month time limit for tribunal claims, and tackling the barriers caused by high tribunal fees\u201d.</p> <p>In her response to the committee\u2019s report, Business Minister Margot James stressed that discrimination in the workplace is illegal.</p> <p>James said: \u201cIt is completely unacceptable that pregnant women and new mothers are apparently being forced to quit their jobs because of outdated attitudes.</p> <p>\u201cTackling this issue is a key priority of mine and this government and I would like to thank the committee for its important work. We will consider its recommendations carefully and respond in due course.\u201d</p> <h2>\u2018It came as a complete shock\u2019<br></h2> <p>Rebecca Raven was sacked from her \u00a321,000-a-year job teaching art at a private school after telling the headmistress she wanted to take maternity leave. </p> <p>An employment tribunal later ruled that Raven, who was represented by the Association of Teachers and Lecturers, had been unfairly dismissed by Howell\u2019s School, in Denbigh, north Wales. In 2012 the school was ordered to pay Raven \u00a334,000 in compensation, but she said that, so far, she hasn\u2019t seen a penny. </p> <p>The 36-year-old from Wrexham, who now runs her own business, said: \u201cThere is discrimination law and equality law, but employers are getting away with flouting it.\u201d</p> <p>She recalls being told by one of the school trustees that they did not want to \u201cwaste money on maternity pay\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI was very clued up. I had been previously self-employed and I knew my rights. But I was made to feel like a criminal. It came as a complete shock. When you are pregnant, you are emotional anyway, but the whole thing put me under a lot of pressure.\u201d<br></p> <p>She welcomed the report\u2019s findings, in particular the recommendation for a reduction in tribunal fees, which have risen in recent years.</p>",

The highest-paid CEOs on a realised pay basis were the co-CEOs of Westfield Corp, Steven and Peter Lowy, who realised $24.7m against reported pay of $21.7m.</p> <p>They were followed by Seek CEO Andrew Bassat, who realised $19.39m, and Scentre Group CEO, Peter Allen, with a realised pay of $17.9m.

But he has long been intensely and personally aware of the issues. When he was younger, he struggled with his identity as a gay man. As an employment lawyer at Morgan Stanley, he saw many cases of discrimination on all sorts of grounds, and jumped at the chance to organise an LGBTIQ [lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, intersex and questioning] resource within the company as an extracurricular role.</p> <p>\u201cIt was a transformative experience,\u201d he says. \u201cI felt much more present, much more connected and much more alive in my work.\u201d When he was asked to step out of his lawyer role to lead the company\u2019s diversity program, he embraced it, he says.

  "<p>If bookmakers are to be believed, the evolution of Europe\u2019s Ryder Cup team will come at an immediate cost.

Europe\u2019s captain was at his most bullish yet with regards to the additions of Pieters, Lee Westwood and Martin Kaymer. He explained his choices with reason and assuredness. \u201cWe have six rookies, one of them [Danny Willett] is the Masters champion,\u201d said Clarke. \u201cThe other guys have won tournaments all over the world.</p> <p>\u201cWho would you have picked for experience? Who is in form? If I\u2019m going to add experience to it, I need to have form. I need to see guys that are playing well. Unfortunately, the two guys that would have fallen into that category, Graeme McDowell and Luke Donald, are not quite playing the way we know they can play.</p> <p>\u201cI would have loved them to be playing a little bit better to give me a bigger headache but it didn\u2019t happen. My options of adding to the team with strength then came back to rookies again.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m very, very pleased with Martin and Lee adding to the team because they bring a balance which we have always talked about. The last pick was always going to be the difficult one.</p> <p>\u201cYes, we have six rookies. I\u2019ve got all the trust in the world in them. They have got themselves in this position. It\u2019s not just a straightforward case; if it was, you would go straight down off the world rankings. That\u2019s not the European way. That\u2019s not what we do.</p> <p>\u201cI have a massive amount of belief in the rookies that we have. To put two together, I wouldn\u2019t want to do it but, if I did do that, then I would have confidence in them going out there and delivering a point.\u201d</p> <p>Clarke is right to point to Willett\u2019s status, although the Yorkshireman has been routinely out of sorts since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/apr/11/danny-willett-masterrs-2016-jordan-spieth-lee-westood\">his win at Augusta National in April</a>. Questions, too, hover over the current touch of Andy Sullivan, Matthew Fitzpatrick and Chris Wood.</p> <p>\u201cI was part of that Brookline team and the rookies that we have now play more in America,\u201d said Clarke. \u201cI don\u2019t mean any disrespect to the guys that didn\u2019t play until Sunday at Brookline, but the guys are global players nowadays. Those guys did play considerably around the world but it\u2019s different now. The rookies that we have now are more comfortable in America because they have been playing more over there, so it\u2019s somewhat different to what it was back then.\u201d</p> <p>Westwood was similarly upbeat. \u201cI see them not as rookies,\u201d said the 43-year-old. \u201cI look at a lot of the players\u2019 characters and I think they can take it. They can take a fight and a bit of stick.\u201d</p> <p>Indeed this wave of debutants is not necessarily a disaster for Europe. Quite obviously the core of a team that included McDowell, Donald and Ian Poulter for years would change at some point. That Westwood \u2013 who will compete in his 10th Ryder Cup and, with 21 points, is four behind Nick Faldo\u2019s record total \u2013 Rory McIlroy, Sergio Garc\u00eda, Justin Rose and Henrik Stenson are on hand to assist with the transition is a benefit to Clarke, himself immersed in the biennial event.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/30/ryder-cup-darren-clarke-wildcards\">Ryder Cup 2016: Westwood, Kaymer and Pieters selected as wildcard picks</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The USA have players returning to familiar surroundings but the scar tissue associated with defeat upon defeat can hardly be deemed advantageous.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like any other tournament,\u201d said Clarke. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be something totally different but the experienced guys will do what we do in the European way by looking after the first-time guys. Making picks is not just about stats. It\u2019s not just about form, which is important, but it\u2019s about the whole team dynamic, what goes on behind the scenes.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve consulted over this past couple of days with lots of previous Ryder Cup captains to try and just gain a little bit more of an insight and to see what they were thinking whenever they were making picks, in case I was doing anything that might not have fitted in, but every one of them was 100% behind me and very, very helpful.</p> <p>\u201cTheir thoughts on their picks were exactly the same as mine; you\u2019re adding to not just the playing, the playing bit is important, but you need more. Team is more important and the European team ethos is what has enabled us to be as successful as we have. With this team, that\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to do and take this forward.\u201d</p> <p>Clarke batted away fitness fears regarding Stenson, who withdrew after one round of The Barclays Championship in New York last week with the recurrence of a knee problem. \u201cI\u2019ve spoken to Henrik two or three times,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was purely precautionary; he is OK. I think he has a slight issue but it\u2019s not going to stop him playing.\u201d</p> <p>The overwhelming issue in Europe\u2019s favour is pressure; namely the barrowload of it placed on the USA. A miserable recent run \u2013 they have lost six of the past seven \u2013 triggered a task force, the inclusion of Tiger Woods as a vice\u2011captain and the apparent acceptance of the complaints so <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/sep/28/phil-mickelson-tom-watson-ryder-cup\">vociferously aired by Phil Mickelson at Gleneagles two years ago</a>. Quite where the PGA of America would turn to in event of another defeat is anybody\u2019s guess.</p> <p>For now Davis Love has to decide on four picks with some big names in Rickie Fowler, Bubba Watson, Matt Kuchar and Jim Furyk having failed to qualify automatically. Love will name three of his four on 12 September as he seeks to halt what would be an unprecedented fourth victory in a row for Europe.</p> <p>\u201cThankfully one of my hard parts of the job is over and done with but Davis has that ahead of him,\u201d said Clarke. \u201cHe\u2019s been there before and I\u2019m sure he will make very, very solid choices.</p> <p>\u201cI know he\u2019s going to have a tough decision to make. There are some big names not on that American team and they are going to consult with everybody, with members of the task force, to see what they are going to do. They have got to try and get the right mix on the team as well.\u201d</p> <p>None of which is Clarke\u2019s concern. On Tuesday,he exuded a level of confidence which, if transferred to Europe\u2019s players, offers a decent antidote to betting markets.</p> <h2>The 12 players who will aim to retain the Ryder Cup for Europe</h2> <h2>Rory McIlroy (Northern Ireland)</h2> <p><strong>Age </strong>27 <strong>World ranking </strong>5 <strong>Ryder Cups</strong> 3 (2010, 12, 14) <strong>This season\u2019s earnings </strong>$2,700,835 <strong>Majors </strong>4</p> <p>Having once dismissed the Ryder Cup as \u201can exhibition\u201d McIlroy has now been on the winning team in all three of his appearances.

I\u2019ve seen Rory McIlroy up close since he was a very young kid. Thomas Pieters impresses me in the same league as those guys. He has that amount of talent.\u201d</p> <p>Clarke said his call to Knox, the world No20, was \u201creally, really difficult to make\u201d, with the Scot seeking to make a rookie appearance of his own. The captain hinted that Knox\u2019s failure to play at the Wyndham Championship in North Carolina, from which he could have gained automatic entry into the team, was significant. \u201cI thought he might have played,\u201d he said. \u201cI spoke to him the day after he won the Travelers Championship and suggested to him that he might want to go and play. He decided not to do that. He wanted to be fresh for the FedEx [play-offs]; that was obviously very important to him and that\u2019s fine.</p> <p>\u201cIf he had gone to the Wyndham, maybe we wouldn\u2019t be having this conversation right now. If Russell had gone, he may have forced his way into the automatic spots, which would have changed the conversation. We won\u2019t know.\u201d</p> <p>Pieters, a three-times European Tour winner, immediately exuded confidence. \u201cThere\u2019s no fear factor,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a matter of dealing with the crowds. I haven\u2019t really played in front of a crowd that\u2019s against you, so that will be interesting, but I\u2019ll be up for the task.\u201d</p> <p>Knox offered his support to Europe but did little to hide his disappointment. The 31-year-old will now look to refocus through the FedEx series. \u201cIt\u2019s certainly motivated me for the next three weeks, that\u2019s for sure,\u201d he said. \u201cI have to use this as a springboard to try and win the FedEx Cup. I\u2019ve never wanted to prove someone wrong so badly in my life. It\u2019s not sour grapes or anything, Darren had an extremely difficult decision and all of those three guys were worthy of a pick.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to be difficult for me to watch it but I probably will \u2013 and I\u2019ll be rooting for the team, of course.

  "<p>At least somebody loves Joe Hart. Whereas he was frozen out of Manchester City at a speed that would surprise even gelato manufacturers, the England international was met by rapturous crowds on his arrival in Turin on Tuesday. The new Torino goalkeeper wore sunglasses that Marcello Mastroianni would have been proud of and posed, perhaps inadvisedly, with a T-shirt celebrating the club\u2019s Granata Ultras. Welcome to Serie A, Joe.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/29/joe-hart-torino-loan-manchester-city\">In choosing to join Torino</a> Hart becomes part of a select, if not always successful, group. The 34th British player to sign for an Italian club since the second world war, Hart follows in the footsteps of not just John Charles but also Jay Bothroyd. While David Platt made his reputation in Serie A, Des Walker almost contrived to blow it. And for every cult hero \u2013 a Trevor Francis or Paul Ince \u2013 there is at least one who has left with a good riddance. And yes, that includes Paul Gascoigne, described by one Italian journalist as \u201cone of the worst buys since the war\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/30/jack-wilshere-joe-hart-manchester-city-arsenal\">Jack Wilshere beats Joe Hart in transfer tales of woe table this summer</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Before making the decision to move Hart consulted his friend and former City team-mate Micah Richards. The Aston Villa defender spent a season at Fiorentina two years ago and loved it. \u201cHe asked me about Italy and I told him it\u2019s probably the best country you can go to,\u201d Richards told the Guardian. \u201cIt was one of the best experiences in my life. Obviously I got to live in Florence, an amazing city, but the people were really welcoming, really nice, and made me feel right at home.\u201d</p> <p>One of the biggest things Hart will have to contend with, says Richards, is the change in footballing culture. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot different to England,\u201d he says. \u201cIt is much more tactical \u2013 everyone knows their jobs. In Italy they will always play an older player who has more experience than a younger one who wants to express themselves. Every day in training you work on tactics, you work on shape. On the other hand it\u2019s not so physical. It helped my game, though. I like to get up and down but they helped me to know when to hold my position.\u201d</p> <p>The former England international Tony Dorigo, who played for Torino in the 1997-98 season, knows better than most what Hart is getting into. He says it is not just the culture on the pitch that Hart will have to adjust to. \u201cIt\u2019s really intense, extremely intense, it\u2019s absolutely crazy,\u201d he says. \u201cI remember once when we lost a match at home and the following day the fans stormed the training ground. We had to fly somewhere else to train and then stay there for the entire week. The fans give you great power when they get behind you, but you feel the pressure all the time.\u201d</p> <p>Dorigo, now a pundit for BT Sport\u2019s Serie A coverage, believes that Hart will be busy in his new role. Although Torino competed in the Europa League last season they finished a disappointing 12th in Serie A. This summer the manager, Giampero Ventura, left to replace Antonio Conte as the Italy coach, with Sinisa Mijhailovic replacing him. \u201cIt looks as if they will end up getting rid of three of their four best defenders this summer,\u201d says Dorigo. \u201cSo Hart will get plenty of work. Torino are a club that have to change a lot. They get good players but they have to sell them too.\u201d</p> <p>Torino\u2019s association with British football runs longer than most, dating back to the 1960s and the signing of Joe Baker and Denis Law. Two of the most promising forwards in Britain, Baker and Law were also only 21 years old. The pair acquired a reputation as young men about town. Constantly followed by paparazzi, Baker famously assaulted one then, on another fateful night, crashed his Aston Martin into a statue of Garibaldi. He and Law survived the crash but their careers in Italy were soon over.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e5a15de3e782923a3cbd699bab6384b7bd9b9202\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e5a15de3e782923a3cbd699bab6384b7bd9b9202/72_0_2205_1323/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Joe Hart arrives to a rapturous reception in Turin after confirming his season\u2019s loan move to Torino from Manchester City.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Joe Hart arrives to a rapturous reception in Turin after confirming his season\u2019s loan move to Torino from Manchester City.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alessandro Di Marco/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>John Foot, in his history of Italian football, Calcio, describes the careers of British footballers that went a similar way, from Jimmy Greaves to Gascoigne. Greaves had gone to Italy only because of England\u2019s maximum wage and, as soon as the rule was overturned, felt homesick. Gazza, meanwhile, was known not only for his drinking and tendency towards injury but also for his bad manners, notoriously answering one journalist\u2019s question with a big burp.</p> <p>The problem, as Foot sees it, was with the fact that such high standards had been set by British football\u2019s first great export, John Charles. The Gentle Giant who played for Juventus for six years from 1957-63 is still remembered fondly in Turin.</p> <p>\u201cJohn Charles remains the model against which all foreign players \u2013 and especially British players \u2013 have been measured,\u201d says Foot. \u201cHe was an exemplary figure on the field and off the field where he was known for being modest, generous and \u2018good\u2019. No other British player has come close.\u201d Foot adds a coda, observing that another well-mannered export also left a good impression. \u201cMy advice to British players in Italy is don\u2019t get drunk. It\u2019s bad publicity and conforms to stereotypes. One person who was quite good there was David Beckham.\u201d</p> <p>But Hart is part of a mini-revival of Britons looking for an Italian job. Ashley Cole, Nathaniel Chalobah and Richards have played in Serie A in the past three seasons and, at the time of writing, Ravel Morrison remains on Lazio\u2019s books. For Richards this trend will continue. \u201cIt\u2019s not that people don\u2019t want to go away,\u201d he says. \u201cBut you\u2019re in your comfort zone in the Premier League. But now that more Champions League places are going to be guaranteed [from 2018-19] I think loads of players will want to give it a go.\u201d</p> <p>Dorigo, meanwhile, has one final piece of advice for England\u2019s number one as he embarks on a new chapter in his career. \u201cMove to Moncalieri,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful village 10 miles outside the city. And when you wake up, the first things you see are the Alps.\u201d</p>",

The setpiece duels have not always been so consequential, but there is a sense that, in this most extraordinary of election years, Clinton v Trump could be a game changer.</p> <p>Chen, a research fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University, who also prepared Mitt Romney for his 2012 debates with Barack Obama, said: \u201cPeople have an impression of these candidates from TV ads, but the debate is the first opportunity people have to see them in their own words one-on-one. They are going to be crucial to the arc of the campaign. If Donald Trump is not able to perform in these debates then the election\u2019s over.\u201d</p> <p>For Trump, <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/us/general_election_trump_vs_clinton_vs_johnson_vs_stein-5952.html\">consistently trailing in opinion polls</a>, the three upcoming debates now represent the best chance to shift the narrative, perhaps a last throw of the dice. Chen said he <a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/2016/08/29/opinions/five-debate-prep-tips-trump-chen/index.html\">needs to make the case</a> against Clinton without exaggeration, demonstrate that he has the right temperament and judgment, and show a grasp of policy.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s very experienced with TV,\u201d he said. \u201cNo one should underestimate Donald Trump\u2019s ability to have a good debate. I\u2019m not convinced that, as some people are saying, he\u2019s going to be a disaster of a debater.\u201d</p> <p>Trump\u2019s rallies and tweets reflect a tension between scripted material and the improvised, shoot-from-the-hip approach that he favours. The bombastic businessman has reportedly held informal meetings about the debates but is eschewing methodical homework, trying to make his political inexperience a virtue. He <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/30/us/politics/hillary-clinton-donald-trump-debate.html?_r=0\">told the New York Times last week</a>: \u201cI believe you can prep too much for those things. It can be dangerous. You can sound scripted or phony \u2013 like you\u2019re trying to be someone you\u2019re not.\u201d</p> <p>He boasted: \u201cI know how to handle Hillary.\u201d</p> <p>His advisers reportedly include Roger Ailes, who was <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/22/business/media/roger-ailes-fox-news.html\">ousted</a> as Fox News chairman last month over allegations of sexual harassment. A friend of Trump\u2019s, who did not wish to be named, said: \u201cThe debates are an area that Roger Ailes knows better than anyone else in the world.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bbd3b9d6480d416d27a81a63a5141586a4a8ed60\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bbd3b9d6480d416d27a81a63a5141586a4a8ed60/0_108_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Senator Marco Rubio and Donald Trump\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Senator Marco Rubio and Donald Trump at a Republican primary debate in March.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joe Raedle/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Clinton, meanwhile, mindful of her 2008 primary defeat by Obama and 2016 scare from Bernie Sanders, is taking nothing in this campaign for granted and aiming to be hyper-prepared. \u201cI\u2019m running against someone who will say or do anything, and who knows what that might be,\u201d she was <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/08/29/i-dont-know-which-donald-trump-will-show-up-clinton-says-of-debating-trump/\">quoted as saying by the Washington Post</a>. \u201cI do not know which Donald Trump will show up.\u201d</p> <p>Her advisers are amassing data and in talks with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tonyschwartz\">Tony Schwartz</a><strong>, </strong>the ghostwriter of Trump\u2019s book The Art of the Deal, to gain insights into his deepest insecurities, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/30/us/politics/hillary-clinton-donald-trump-debate.html\">the New York Times reported</a> on Monday. Schwartz, who has expressed regret over the book, tweeted: <strong>\u201c</strong>Trump isn\u2019t preparing for debates because he can\u2019t. No attention span = deep ignorance about issues. He will be all bluster, no substance.\u201d</p> <p>The Clinton team are also studying Trump\u2019s performances in 11 Republican primary debates, when he was the dominant figure on stage, and memorably once even made reference to the size of his manhood. Her press secretary Brian Fallon wrote on Twitter: \u201cFor all his lack of substance, Trump\u2019s showmanship, as ex-TV star, makes him a formidable debate foe. He thrashed his rivals in GOP debates.\u201d</p> <p>Joel Benenson, chief strategist for the Clinton campaign, told CNN on Tuesday: \u201cWhat Donald Trump had in the primaries was a different ball of wax entirely. He had a free-for-all with eight people on the stage. In 90 minutes, he spoke for about 12 minutes. I don\u2019t think he can go toe-to-toe with her.</p> <p>\u201cI think he\u2019ll be very aggressive. I don\u2019t think he can go toe-to-toe with her on policy; I don\u2019t think he can go toe-to-toe with her on substance. I think we\u2019ll see a lot of the same kind of hyper-over-the-top rhetoric from him that we\u2019ve seen. That\u2019s who he is. I don\u2019t think he can control himself.\u201d</p> <p>One big, unresolved question for the Clinton camp is who to cast in the role of Trump during mock debates, a vital part of the preparation process. That person faces the unenviable duty of attacking her over her husband Bill\u2019s sexual indiscretions and bringing up other humiliating talking points.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cd3d2fd4e8ffa58234a12cdd86014342f3027e46\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cd3d2fd4e8ffa58234a12cdd86014342f3027e46/0_0_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders debate\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders debate in April during the Democratic primaries.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lucas Jackson/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Kennedy v Nixon pulled in 66 million viewers and the four debates between the two drew 60% of US households on average. The 1980 debate between Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan was watched by 81 million viewers. Less than 40% of US households tuned in for Obama and Romney in 2012, according to Nielsen, although the clash generated more than 10 million posts on Twitter. </p> <p>It remains to be seen whether Clinton v Trump can rival the biggest TV event in US history, the 2015 Super Bowl, which was watched by 114 million people.</p> <p>Robert Shrum, who helped prepare Democrats Al Gore and John Kerry for their debates with George W Bush in 2000 and 2004, said: \u201cShe has to prepare for mild Trump, wild Trump and somewhere-in-between Trump. This means not only getting a grasp of the substance but doing lots of practice. You can figure out predictable things he\u2019s going to say and ways to come back at him.\u201d</p> <p>Shrum added: \u201cCandidates under pressure in these debates tend to say things they\u2019ve said on the road. We knew in 2004 that Bush would probably say we invaded Iraq because of 9/11. Kerry had a mantra in his head and said: \u2018<a href=\"http://www.debates.org/index.php?page=september-30-2004-debate-transcript\">Saddam Hussein didn\u2019t attack us. Osama bin Laden attacked us</a>.\u2019 Bush looked like he\u2019d been hit by a wet fish. Kerry won all three debates but, unfortunately, didn\u2019t win the election.\u201d</p> <p>This time, however, he believes the debate is critical to Trump\u2019s chances. \u201cIt\u2019s fundamental. Trump has one chance and one chance only to pass the commander-in-chief test. He needs people to say this man can be president of the United States, he\u2019s got the temperament and we can trust him with the nuclear codes.\u201d</p> <p>Some analysts suggest that Trump is thin-skinned and could easily be tempted to lash out against Clinton, an experienced and skilled debater. But Roger Stone, a political consultant and friend of Trump\u2019s for more than three decades, said: \u201cI have a lot of confidence in his instincts. He\u2019s going to do fine. It\u2019s a great opportunity: the debates benefit the candidate who\u2019s behind. Within the political realm, she\u2019s better known and has more experience.</p> <p>\u201cThe only thing predictable about Donald Trump is that he\u2019s entirely unpredictable. She\u2019s never going to know which way he\u2019s going to come at her.\u201d</p> <p>This, along with the constant hum and hype of 24-hour cable news, will make for a very American spectacle. \u201cI\u2019m going to open some popcorn and watch them all,\u201d Chen said.</p>",
  "<p>More than two dozen MPs have been sent an identical message threatening to kill them and their family, along with a picture of a severed head.</p> <p>Chris Bryant, a former shadow cabinet minister, said police were investigating the threats against at least 25 MPs made at the weekend, which come two months after the murder of his Labour colleague Jo Cox.</p> <p>Bryant said threats against politicians were on the rise and those who are women, gay or from a minority ethnic background appeared to receive the worst treatment.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to give too much detail because obviously there is a police investigation going on now,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the truth is that this is a regular part of what we are dealing with at the moment, and I don\u2019t want police to waste time and I don\u2019t want politicians to be treated differently, but the truth of the matter is that we are in the public eye and somehow or other, this world of the internet has fostered an anger and a bitterness which a lot of us are still bearing the emotional scars of losing one of our colleagues earlier on this year. And the sad thing is that is not the only time that has happened.\u201d<br></p> <p>The identical death threats are understood to have been sent to MPs from across the parties and contain a same message: \u201cWarning I am going to kill you and all of your family.\u201d</p> <p>A spokesman for the Metropolitan police said the force was investigating a linked series of threatening emails that had been received by a number of MPs since Friday.</p> <p>\u201cAll of these emails have been received via MPs\u2019 parliamentary email accounts. No arrests have been made and enquiries are ongoing. This is not being treated as a terrorist incident,\u201d he added.</p> <p>People have been prosecuted in recent months for making death threats to Labour MPs <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jul/27/internet-troll-jail-violent-antisemitic-threats-labour-mp-luciana-berger\">Luciana Berger</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/23/man-given-suspended-sentence-death-threat-mp-ben-bradshaw-geoffrey-farquharson\">Ben Bradshaw</a>. </p> <p>Labour MP <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/jess-phillips\">Jess Phillips</a> revealed this month that she was having a \u201cpanic room\u201d fitted in her constituency officeafter a series of threats to her safety. A number of other parliamentarians are in the process of updating security measures at their homes and constituency offices.</p> <p>Bryant has been one of the most vocal in calling for threats against MPs to be taken more seriously.</p> <p>\u201cWhat is particularly disturbing is that a lot of these threats are to women. I think women MPs, gay MPs, ethnic minority MPs get the brunt of it,\u201d he said. \u201cOr at least that is what I have heard from people on an anecdotal basis. </p> <p>\u201cOne of the things that I have been very keen to try and achieve is that we should have in parliament a proper body which I think is now being set up, which will look at all of this in the round so that it is not just Greater Manchester police and then Merseyside and so on, dealing individually with MPs. But you can see whether, for instance, the same person is targeting all of these people or not.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>In November 2012, an internal report into <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/nov/14/report-damns-un-sri-lanka\">the shortcomings of the United Nations</a> in the final stages of the war in Sri Lanka urged: never again. <a href=\"http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=43496#.V8WspNfd5Rm\">The secretary general embraced it</a>, speaking frankly about the UN\u2019s failure to meet its responsibilities and the need to learn lessons. Ban Ki-moon went on to note that the conflict in Syria was the latest reminder of how crucial the organisation\u2019s work was.</p> <p>Almost four years on, however, the Syrian crisis shows the dilemmas still faced by UN humanitarian missions, and persistent deficiencies in its response. The $4bn (\u00a33bn) aid effort is its most expensive and challenging to date. The dedication of its staff is to be commended. It is also all the more reason to be dismayed by the Guardian\u2019s revelations that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/29/un-pays-tens-of-millions-to-assad-regime-syria-aid-programme-contracts\">contracts worth tens of millions of dollars</a> have gone to people close to Bashar al-Assad. They include payments to businessmen whose companies are under US and EU sanctions and to charities set up by the president\u2019s wife, Asma al-Assad, and his friend and cousin Rami Makhlouf, linked to pro-regime militia groups.</p> <p>The problem is clear: operating in the country forces humanitarians to make difficult choices, as a UN spokesman has said. One could be blunter: it forces them to make bad choices, since those are the only kind available. Faced with choosing between dealing with unsavoury partners or turning its back on needy civilians, it has opted for the former course. Yet the decisions it has made in Syria are of deep concern to many within the organisation as well as outside it. These unhappy compromises have left millions of desperate civilians without aid, and enabled a flow of aid to government-controlled areas which bolsters Mr Assad.</p> <p>Concerns that the regime might kick the UN out of Syria entirely, should it become too outspoken, are real. With Moscow on his side, the president feels he has little to fear. Yet it is worth considering the precedents again. The 2012 Sri Lanka review found that the UN had failed to adequately confront the government over its obstructions to humanitarian assistance. Thousands died from inadequate medical care and lack of food. In at least one instance, the report noted, the expectation that the UN would not confront the government may have influenced the latter\u2019s actions.</p> <p>The international community has failed to halt the war. A robust and fair humanitarian response is the very least required. The UN\u2019s scope for leverage may be extremely limited, but it is not nonexistent. In one of the most disturbing cases in Syria, the World Health Organisation has spent more than $5m to support the national blood bank \u2013 controlled by the defence department. Insiders questioned the legality of dealing with defence rather than health officials, and acknowledged concerns that supplies could be directed to the military first. Blood bags and testing kits are not included on UN convoys from Damascus to areas outside government control. Yet when the agreement was drafted, the Syrian government could not obtain the supplies that it needed. This was, surely, a prime opportunity to push back.</p> <p>The UN now faces <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/30/un-under-pressure-to-set-up-inquiry-into-syria-aid-programme\">calls for an independent inquiry</a> into its actions. Such a review would be valuable. But the record shows that asking the right questions and drawing the appropriate conclusions are one thing; putting them into action is the much harder but more important task.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 31 August 2016.

  "<p>How\u2019s that for taking control? On Tuesday the union that Britain has just voted to leave delivered its biggest and most important tax ruling of the lot. After two years of investigations, the European commission ruled that Apple had enjoyed special favours on its taxes from Ireland. Very lucrative favours, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/aug/30/reports-to-offer-latest-clues-on-brex--business-live\">worth around \u20ac13bn (\u00a311bn) in unpaid tax to the Irish government</a>.</p> <p>The case goes to the heart of much that is wrong with modern politics and business \u2013 of a system in which ministers help tax-dodgers and rent-seekers to rake in billions, while community businesses go to the wall and hard-pressed families see pay packets shrink and their public services cut. It also offers the voters of Brexit Britain a grim warning of the ever more dysfunctional capitalism being urged on their government by the free-market fundamentalists around the cabinet table and the lobbyists for investment banks and big business.</p> <p>The big underlying question here goes far deeper than tax. It is this: how much is enough? How much should the top executives and big shareholders of Apple, or any other major company, get back \u2013 and how much do they owe their workers, the societies that protect their property rights, provide their infrastructure and workforces, and grant their legal liabilities? The story of the world\u2019s most famous consumer electronics firm confirms how much the pendulum needs to be swung back towards the rest of us.</p> <p>As companies go, you don\u2019t get richer than Apple. Analysts calculate that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/20/us-corporate-giants-hoarding-over-a-trillion-dollars-apple-microsoft-google\">the firm is sitting on $216bn (\u00a3165bn)</a> \u2013 getting on for double the total international reserves of the entire US government <a href=\"https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/IR-Position/Pages/08122016.aspx\">(worth $121bn, at the last count)</a>. This is not money just about to be invested in excellent new products, ploughed into improving conditions and training for workers, or donated to good causes.

All profits from all sales made in Europe were booked in Ireland. Almost all the profits allocated to Apple Sales International, in Cork, were shifted to a head office within the firm. This \u201chead office\u201d, remarked the commission, \u201cwas not based in any country and did not have any employees or own premises. Its activities consisted solely of occasional board meetings.\u201d The head office existed only on paper, and the profits allocated to it went untaxed \u2013 a version of globalisation taken to its deformed, absurd limit. If Samuel Beckett had dabbled in accounting, this is the kind of elaborate joke he might have dreamt up.</p> <p>Perhaps even he would have stopped short of scripting Dublin\u2019s response , which was to angrily reject the \u20ac13bn on offer \u2013 and to begin a costly legal appeal. The unpaid taxes would pay for all public spending on the Irish health service for a year \u2013 and then some. But for decades the Irish state\u2019s business model has been based on super-low tax rates for multinationals such as Facebook, in the hope of getting some coppers off their cash piles and a few jobs. When Apple said on Tuesday that <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/uk/customer-letter/\">next to no research work was carried out in its European headquarters of Cork</a>, it was both preparing for a legal appeal and giving the game away about the quality of jobs it has actually created in Ireland.</p> <p>It is no good the Obama administration accusing Europe\u2019s competition enforcer, Margrethe Vestager, of being anti-American: she has recently dished out punishment to Italy\u2019s Fiat and Russia\u2019s Gazprom. Apple once boasted that its machines were \u201cmade in America\u201d, but it has now shifted manufacturing jobs to China, even though research shows that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/apr/23/bad-apple-employ-more-us-workers\">it would still make a healthy profit keeping its factories in the US</a>.</p> <p>The lessons here for Brexit Britain are unignorable. For a long time, the City of London has functioned as a tax haven, the no-questions-asked capital of the rich world. As she maps out the UK\u2019s future outside the EU at Chequers on Wednesday, Theresa May is under ever more pressure to go further down that route \u2013 to turn all of Britain into some light-touch special enterprise zone, with favours for industries making extravagant promises. The lesson of Apple in Ireland is that such promises are never as good as they seem. The foreign direct investment turns out to be indirect enrichment of a few, even while the host country\u2019s economy gets ever sicklier.</p>",
  "<p>We are extremely concerned about the continuing use of chlorine as a chemical weapon in Syria, which the UN has just confirmed, and the suffering it causes for an already traumatised people (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/25/assad-regime-isis-chemical-attacks-syria-un-investigators\" title=\"\">Report</a>, 25 August). Any use of chemical weapons, whatever the toxic chemical used, is illegal under the 1997 Chemical Weapons Convention and international customary law. Some 192 countries have signed up to this convention, including Syria. As with many chemical weapons attacks, identifying the user is problematic because the perpetrator has invariably fled the scene. Collecting evidence in the middle of an active theatre of war is even more complicated. We therefore welcome the recent report of the UN investigation and the call by the US that President Assad be held accountable by the security council.</p> <p>It must be emphasised by all signatories to the CWC that those using chlorine to injure and kill are committing a crime and will be held to account. So, we call on the UK government, the UN and the international community to be resolute in their commitment to investigating both the use and users of chemical weapons in Syria, and to prosecuting the perpetrators.</p> <p>We also call on all practitioners of chemistry, be they in academe, industry, or trading of materials, to point out that chemicals should be used to help mankind.

It is understood that Sunderland are also showing an interest in Bony as well as the Leicester striker Leonardo Ulloa.</p> <p>Stoke had initially targeted Berahino to add some firepower to their attack, but West Brom will not allow the 23-year-old to leave unless they can bring in another striker first. With the clock ticking, Stoke are not optimistic that will happen and for that reason have widened their net.</p> <p>The Midlands club also remain in the market for a defender and another goalkeeper to provide cover. Mamadou Sakho was identified to fill the centre-half position and although the defender has rejected the chance to join them on loan, Stoke have not totally given up on the possibility of signing the 26-year-old, especially now that Liverpool have made it clear the Frenchman is not part of J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s plans.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57c5b6c4e4b04fe839bc5002\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/ed-aarons\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-30T16:40:42.258Z\">5.40pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>More on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/30/stoke-set-to-sign-bruno-martins-indi-from-fc-porto-on-season-long-loan\">the Bruno Martins Indi news</a> mentioned earlier \u2026</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> Stoke are closing in on the signing of Bruno Martins Indi from FC Porto after agreeing a deal to take the Holland central defender on a season-long loan.</p> <p>Martins Indi, who moved to Portugal from Feyenoord for \u20ac7.7m, has been told he is free to leave the Est\u00e1dio do Drag\u00e3o this summer after Porto <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/30/eliaquim-mangala-porto-loan-manchester-city-samir-nasri\">lined up Manchester City\u2019s Eliaquim Mangala</a> as his replacement.</p> <p>The 24-year-old has won 31 caps for his country and was a regular in Louis van Gaal\u2019s side which reached the semi-finals at the 2014 World Cup.

One lesson may be that a Europe-wide regulator can twist corporate arms harder than national governments can.</p> <p>Few government agencies apply pressure harder than the FBI.

  "<p>A 2011 Ohio abortion restriction which supporters touted as a health measure had no perceptible benefits for women\u2019s safety and drastically reduced the number and effectiveness of abortions by medication, according to a new <a href=\"http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1002110\">study</a> published in PLOS Medicine.</p> <p>The study scrutinized the impact of requirements for abortion providers to strictly adhere to the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s labelling for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/30/fda-approves-new-abortion-drug-labeling-reproductive-rights\">mifepristone</a>, commonly known as the abortion pill. In recent years, several conservative states have enacted such requirements, citing women\u2019s safety. </p> <p>But mainstream medical groups say the evidence shows the FDA guidelines are outdated and recommend abortion providers prescribe the pills according to the latest evidence. The old regimen is more costly, less effective, and more cumbersome for patients. And abortion rights advocates have argued that laws like Ohio\u2019s are thinly veiled attempts to limit an easy method of abortion. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/sep/08/ohio-abortion-clinic-planned-parenthood-cincinnati\">Ohio Planned Parenthood fights back at frontline of new conservative assault</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Lending some credence to their arguments, the new study found that the number of women having abortions by using medication cratered after the law took effect. </p> <p>In 2010, the year before the law was in place, 22% of all abortions in Ohio were medication abortions. In the three years after, only 5% were. The number of women obtaining medication abortions was so small, in fact, that it took Dr Ushma Upadhyay, the researcher who conducted the study, three years after the law took effect to collect a representative sample size.</p> <p>The law can also be associated with \u201cmore visits, more side-effects, and higher costs for women compared to before the law\u201d, the study said. After the new rules took effect, women using the abortion pill were three times more likely to need additional treatment \u2013 another dose of medication or a surgical procedure \u2013 to end their pregnancies. </p> <p>Women reported experiencing more side-effects of the drugs, notably nausea or vomiting. And because the outdated drug regimen calls for a higher dose of one of the drugs, medication abortion cost women $125 more, on average.</p> <p>At the same time, the study found, Ohio\u2019s anti-abortion law wasn\u2019t associated with safer abortions. \u201cThere is no evidence that the change in law led to improved abortion outcomes,\u201d the author wrote. \u201cIndeed, our findings suggest the opposite.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cRetrospectively, you can see these laws were ridiculous,\u201d said Beverly Winikoff, the president of Gynuity Health Projects, which researches ways to make the abortion pill more widely available. \u201cThese laws were paraded around as somehow being better for women when there was no and still is no evidence that the things this law did would have made abortion safer.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo matter how hard you look, you can\u2019t find any benefit for women,\u201d she continued. \u201cNot for their health, not for their pocketbook, not for their convenience, nothing.\u201d</p> <p>Upadhyay, a researcher with a University of California \u2013 San Francisco program, Advancing New Standards in Reproductive Health, analyzed the medical charts of 2,783 women who obtained medication abortions at four Ohio abortion clinics between 2010 and 2014.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>She expected to see some drop in the number of medication abortions, but not one this dramatic. \u201cI wasn\u2019t expecting a threefold increase in the proportion of women who required additional treatments,\u201d said Upadhyay. \u201cBut there\u2019s no other potential confounder that could have explained the difference.\u201d</p> <p>The FDA approved mifepristone for sale in 2000, with a label based on European prescribing practices from the 1980s. By the time the FDA approved the label, mainstream medical groups such as the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists already considered its instructions to be out of date. They encouraged abortion clinics to prescribe the pill off-label and according to the latest evidence, a practice which is legal and even encouraged by the FDA. <br></p> <p><br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>The modern prescribing guidelines called for a smaller dose of mifepristone and allowed women to take a second course of medication at home, saving them an extra trip to the doctor\u2019s office. The evidence-based guidelines also allow the pill to be prescribed later in a pregnancy. </p> <p>Ohio\u2019s law is still in force, but early this year, its effects became moot. The FDA <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/30/fda-approves-new-abortion-drug-labeling-reproductive-rights\">announced</a> in March that it had approved a new label for the drug reflecting the modern prescribing guidelines. The change allowed Ohio abortion providers to resume prescribing the pill in the same way as before the law took effect. </p> <p>The same was true for two other states, North Dakota and Texas, that had passed similar requirements. (Laws passed in Oklahoma, Arizona, and Arkansas are currently blocked in court.)</p> <p>Some abortion patients have reported a preference for the abortion pill over the surgery because they feel the medication abortion is more private. Under the modern prescribing regimen, women can take their second doses of medication at home. </p> <p>But Ohio\u2019s law, said its critics, eliminated the benefits of the pill. Because a woman must take the second dose in the doctor\u2019s office, the abortion is less private and potentially more unpleasant. One abortion provider <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2015/09/conservatives-block-abortion-pill\">reported</a> that, after the law forced him to use the outdated regimen, some of his patients would begin bleeding not at home but in their cars as they left his office.</p> <p>In Ohio, many abortion clinics stopped providing medication abortions once the law took effect, because the number of appointments required was so unwieldy. \u201cIt basically defeated the purpose of the medical abortion,\u201d said Sue Postal, who formerly ran an abortion clinic in Toledo and stopped providing the pill due to the law. </p> <p>In states pushing similar restrictions, abortion providers have <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2015/09/conservatives-block-abortion-pill\">threatened to stop providing the pill</a> out of concern that the outdated regimen is not up to the standard of care.</p> <p>Anti-abortion groups, in reaction to the study, repeated their assertions that the abortion pill is dangerous.</p> <p>\u201cA new study by abortion industry advocates released today should be met with the same skepticism we would give to tobacco industry findings that their products are \u2018safe\u2019,\u201d said Clarke Forsythe, the senior counsel for Americans United for Life, which supports restrictions on medication abortions. (In the study, Upadhyay discloses the Susan Thompson Buffet Foundation as a source of funding and states that the foundation had no role in executing the study.) </p> <p>\u201cChemical abortions can be very dangerous for women, and it\u2019s appropriate for state officials to protect women\u2019s lives with life-affirming legislation,\u201d Forsythe said. He cited 2,207 cases of severe adverse events linked to mifepristone that the FDA reported in 2011. </p> <p>Those cases, though, made up a fraction of women who took the pill. The number comes from an FDA a <a href=\"http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/DrugSafety/PostmarketDrugSafetyInformationforPatientsandProviders/UCM263353.pdf\">survey</a> of 1.52 million women who had taken mifepristone which found that only 0.04% of cases had complications requiring hospitalization \u2013 although subsequent studies have argued that the FDA used a method that undercounted the number of complications. </p> <p>Winikoff pointed out that even though the Ohio law is moot today, it still prevents Ohio abortion providers from updating their practices to reflect new evidence until the FDA approves another label for mifepristone. </p> <p>Her group, Gynuity, which provided much of the evidence that prompted the FDA to update its labelling earlier this year, is currently studying the effectiveness of prescribing the pill beyond 10 weeks, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/31/new-us-program-abortion-without-clinic-mifepristone-mifeprex\">mailing the pill</a> to women living in remote areas.</p> <p>Gynuity\u2019s study on prescribing the pill up to 11 weeks should be released by the end of the year. \u201cStay tuned,\u201d Winikoff said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be interesting.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Apple boss Tim Cook is furious. How dare Brussels\u2019 meddling competition regulators <a href=\"http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-16-2923_en.htm\">retrospectively unpick a tax deal</a> that the iPhone-maker had secured from Ireland a quarter of a century ago. What business is it of theirs? Tax, after all, is a sovereign issue for each individual member state within the European Union. The European commission\u2019s ruling would have a \u201cprofound and harmful effect\u201d on investment and job creation in Europe, he said.</p> <p>His political allies at home have waded in too. US Treasury secretary Jack Lew <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/aug/24/apple-taxes-european-commission\">warned last week</a> that the move could have a \u201cchilling effect on US-EU cross-border investment\u201d. The US would have to \u201cconsider potential responses\u201d. </p> <p>According to the Cook script, Apple is a good corporate citizen with a long history of investment and employment in Ireland. That is why, quite properly, almost two-third\u2019s of the group\u2019s profits arise in its Irish-registered subsidiaries. On Tuesday, he posted a lengthy <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/ie/customer-letter/\">message direct to customers</a> explaining what a travesty of justice Brussels\u2019 intervention had been, with \u201cno basis in fact or in law\u201d.</p> <p>That, of course, is hogwash. Whatever you think of the commission\u2019s intervention, any honest discussion of Apple\u2019s taxes must start with the admission that its subsidiaries in Knocknaheeny, a run-down suburb of Cork, do not produce almost two-thirds of the group\u2019s profits. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/30/apple-pay-back-taxes-eu-ruling-ireland-state-aid\">Apple ordered to pay up to \u20ac13bn after EU rules Ireland broke state aid laws</a> </p> </aside>  <p>That Cook still clings to this narrative is disappointing, and does not reflect well on those advisers he has gathered around him. </p> <p>The Apple CEO would do well to listen a little to the candid reflections of the firm\u2019s co-founder Steve Wozniak. Earlier this year, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-36108378\">he said</a>: \u201cI don\u2019t like the idea that Apple might be unfair \u2013 not paying taxes the way I do as a person.\u201d </p> <p>For all that, Wozniak noted, on the other hand there are always commercial pressures at play. \u201cAny company that is a public company, its shareholders are going to force it to be as profitable as possible. And that means financial people studying all the laws of the world and figuring out all the schemes that work that are technically legal.\u201d</p> <p>Cook, though, has his own, cleaner, less equivocal, version of events. And Tuesday was not the first time he has taken to the stage, with faux exasperation, offering justifications of Apple\u2019s huge Irish profits that have for years gone almost entirely untaxed. In 2013, he appeared before the US senate subcommittee on investigations to reject a detailed analysis of the group\u2019s tax planning from Carl Levin (Democrat) and John McCain (Republican).</p> <p>\u201cYou shifted that golden goose to Ireland,\u201d Levin accused Cook, summing up his verdict during a six-hour hearing. \u201cYou shifted it to three companies that do not pay taxes in Ireland \u2026 These are the crown jewels of Apple Inc \u2026 Folks, it\u2019s not right.\u201d</p> <p>Cook affected incredulity. \u201cThere is no [profit] shifting going on that I see at all,\u201d he said. \u201cApple has real operations in real places, with Apple employees selling real products to real customers. We pay all the taxes we owe \u2013 every single dollar \u2026 We don\u2019t depend on tax gimmicks.\u201d</p> <p>That message is now as obsolete as an iPod Classic. Nevertheless, sorting out a fair resolution of Apple\u2019s tax affairs remains less obvious. Where exactly has the tech firm be avoiding its dues? If not Ireland, then where are Apple\u2019s profits truly made? <br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/30/eu-apple-ireland-tax-ruling-q-and-a\">The Apple tax ruling \u2013 what this means for Ireland, tax and multinationals</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The fact that the group\u2019s tax structure has been subject to fierce attack from critics in both Washington and Brussels shows that there are several parties who feel they are entitled to spoils from any revised tax settlement. <br></p> <p>At present though, it is Ireland that is set to benefit from the European commission\u2019s decision. And the result could be a one of the largest ever bills for back taxes, running into many billions of euros. Brussels officials have suggested the figure could be up to \u20ac13bn (\u00a311bn), though the final sum will be for the Irish tax office to determine. </p> <p>Add to that sum interest charges stretching back more than 10 years and the final tally could put a modest, but not insignificant, dent in Apple\u2019s colossal offshore reserves. At last count, this cash pile stood at more than $200bn (\u00a3152bn).</p> <p> However dim the view you take of Apple\u2019s tax planning, though, a multibillion euro windfall for Ireland looks perverse. Critics on both sides of the Atlantic have castigated Dublin\u2019s politicians and regulators for helping Apple spirit taxable profits away from other jurisdictions. Why should Irish taxpayers end up winners?<br></p> <p>It is an uncomfortable irony that Margrethe Vestager, Europe\u2019s competition commissioner, is well aware of. After announcing her Apple decision, she stressed that it was now open to other countries to draw on the commission\u2019s analysis and make their own sub-claims on Apple\u2019s Irish back taxes. Even America, she appeared to hint, could have a call on this money.<br></p> <p>All of which looks a messy prospect, which is unlikely to be resolved for many years. As Vestager noted, her powers are limited. Occasional moves by Brussels to police the taxation of multinationals need to be complemented by co-ordinated and sustained international efforts that close loopholes and ensure tax regimes keep pace with the digital economy.</p> <p>Some argue that Vestager did more on Tuesday to damage than to assist this fragile international consensus on tackling tax avoidance. Certainly her intervention has ruffled feathers and, in the short term at least, appears to offer a far from perfect resolution. <br></p> <p>That said, any serious effort to root out toxic tax behaviour is bound to create upset along the way. There are powerful vested interests that would like to see the taxation of corporate profits wither and fade into history. Vestager has set herself against such ambitions. A few more politicians showing her courage would be a fine thing.<br></p> <ul> <li>This article was amended on 31 August.</li> </ul>",

  "<p>The BBC presenter Jeremy Vine has published video footage showing a driver threatening to knock him out and allegedly assaulting him while he was on his bicycle.</p> <p>Vine said the incident took place while he was commuting through Kensington, west London, on Friday. The Metropolitan police said it had no record of an incident being reported.</p> <p>The footage, posted on Facebook on Tuesday, shows Vine coming to a stop as a black car drives close to his bike. He explains to her that he is trying to stay a car\u2019s width away from the parked cars on both sides of the narrow street. But the woman gets out of the car and starts hurling abuse at him.</p> <p>She says: \u201cWhy the fuck would you stop in front of a car. You don\u2019t respect your fucking life. Move your bike, move your bike. I could have hit you and I\u2019d be done for a murder. Get the fuck out of the road. Fucking idiot, now fuck off. You lot piss me off.\u201d</p> <p>Vine said she began \u201ckicking out\u201d during the tirade, although this cannot be seen on the footage. After shouting at him she gets back in her car and begins tailing him again, at one point nearly hitting a parked vehicle. <br></p> <p>The pair clash again in an incident that Vine said took place 30 seconds later. The woman, in front of him at this point, stops her car at a red traffic light at a junction and approaches him again. </p> <p>As Vine implores her not to hit him \u2013 warning her \u201cYou\u2019ve already assaulted me\u201d \u2013 she says: \u201cIf you take a picture of my car I\u2019m going to knock you out because that\u2019s my personal belonging, don\u2019t fucking take a picture.\u201d</p> <p>She then goes to her vehicle and Vine claims that as he drew up beside her she formed her hand into the shape of a gun which she then pretended to aim and fire at him, although, again, this can not be seen in the footage.</p> <p>Vine wrote on Facebook: \u201cI hate to overload our hard-working London police with footage from my commute, but I feel the person you see on the tape will at some point hurt someone very badly \u2013 either with her car or in a direct personal assault.

Nobody did a deal with Apple and we stand over that. Secondly, we think the commission is getting involved in what is the competence of sovereign governments in Europe. The Europe treaties say that individual countries are responsible for taxation policy. And this is an approach through the back door, to try and influence tax policy, through competition law, and we don\u2019t agree with that.

Indeed, the peer was described in one newspaper as having <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/rights-how-the-law-lords-line-up-1252406.html\">second world war movie hero looks coupled with brains</a>.</p> <p>Goff, who has died aged 89, sat on many of the biggest cases of the past 30 years, including the government\u2019s efforts to ban the sale of the memoirs of the former MI5 agent Peter Wright in his book <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fromthearchive/story/0,12269,1326319,00.html\">Spycatcher</a>, litigation resulting from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/hillsborough-disaster\">Hillsborough disaster</a>, and the extradition of the former Chilean dictator <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/pinochet\">Augusto Pinochet</a>.</p> <p>He was ennobled as Lord Goff of Chieveley on his appointment as a law lord, a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lords_of_Appeal_in_Ordinary\">lord of appeal in ordinary</a>, in 1986, and he was the senior law lord from 1996 until his retirement in 1998.</p> <p>Ever forward-looking, he took the view that the law lords had greater freedom than the rest of the judiciary to \u201cmould and remould the authorities to ensure that practical justice is done within the framework of principle\u201d, and was particularly keen that they should deliver individual judgments rather than a joint one, believing this would lead to the further development of the law.</p> <p>In 1998 he dissented from the judgment of most of his fellow law lords that <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/hillsborough-police-lose-damages-case-1189055.html\">police officers could not sue for trauma suffered in the Hillsborough tragedy</a>.</p> <p>He was also not afraid to extend the sometimes limited boundaries of the law by considering doctrines of other jurisdictions. In 1995, borrowing from German law, he held that a solicitor who had failed to draw up a will before his client died owed a duty of care to the proposed but then disappointed beneficiaries.</p> <p>He came out of retirement in 1999 to be part of a seven-man court to hear the former Chilean dictator General Pinochet\u2019s appeal against extradition to Spain on charges of crimes against humanity. Holding that Pinochet was entitled to immunity, Goff was the only judge to dissent from the ruling that Pinochet could be extradited. The majority decision was eventually overturned by the then home secretary, Jack Straw.</p> <p>Deceptively laid back, essentially kind and courteous to advocates and all who came across him, throughout his life he was a lover of all things Scottish.Born in Perthshire, the son of Lt Col Lionel Goff and Isobel (nee Denroche-Smith), he developed a love of reeling at an early age and could be found leading the dancing both at society balls and in local village halls. Robert was educated at Eton and his father wished his son to then have a military career, but he opted for law. He served in the Scots Guards for four years from 1944 before completing his education at New College, Oxford, where he gained a first in jurisprudence. </p> <p>He was called to the bar in 1951, joining Inner Temple, and became a member of Sir Ashton Roskill\u2019s chambers in 1956. However, he had not immediately left Oxford. He became a fellow and tutor at Lincoln College, where, with <a href=\"http://www.law.cam.ac.uk/press/news/2016/04/professor-gh-jones-1930-2016\">Professor Gareth Jones</a>, he began to write <a href=\"http://www.sweetandmaxwell.co.uk/Catalogue/ProductDetails.aspx?productid=333340&amp;recordid=4543\">The Law of Restitution</a>, developing the hitherto rather sneered-upon concept of \u201cunjust enrichment\u201d. It became the leading textbook on the doctrine.</p> <p>When he did finally enter chambers, his practice was almost exclusively a commercial one, with a leaning towards admiralty work. In 1969 he successfully appeared for the industrialist Sir Bernard Docker, who had sold his yacht to the property developer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/20/harry-hyams\">Harry Hyams</a>. The latter had paid a deposit and then tried to serve a notice alleging \u00a3100,000 of defects in the boat. Goff was able to show the defects had amounted to a mere \u00a3100 and had been immediately rectified.</p> <p>He was appointed a recorder in 1974, and the next year a high court judge sitting in the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/courts-tribunals/queens-bench-division-of-the-high-court\">Queen\u2019s bench division</a>. In 1977 he ruled that it was unlawful to expel Taiwan from the International Badminton Association as a political expedient to allow China to be admitted. The decision allowed Taiwanese women to play in the Uber Cup, the women\u2019s world championship, in 1978. The same year, he ruled that \u201ccarrying away\u201d is sufficient to sustain a charge of kidnapping. The kidnapper did not now have to reach his or her intended destination, as had previously been thought.</p> <p>In 1989 Goff ruled that it would be lawful for doctors to carry out a sterilisation of a 36-year-old woman with a serious mental disability who was incapable of giving her consent. In 1993 this doctrine was extended. Anthony Bland, who was in a permanent vegetative state following the Hillsborough disaster, was the first patient under English law to be allowed to die through the withdrawal of life-prolonging treatment.</p> <p>Goff became a lord justice of appeal and a member of the privy council in 1982. That year he was part of the court that ruled there need be no new inquest into the <a href=\"http://www.blackhistorystudies.com/resources/resources/the-new-cross-fire/\">New Cross fire</a> that had killed 13 young black people at a party. The open verdict had been challenged on the basis that the coroner had tape-recorded the proceedings rather than making handwritten notes. Many years later a second inquest was held, which also returned an open verdict. In 1983 he held that the deliberate sniffing of a gluestick before driving was sufficient to warrant a conviction under the Road Traffic Act.</p> <p>In 1987 he was a member of the judicial committee of the House of Lords when, in a judgment that anticipated the present-day celebrity injunctions, it was held to be pointless to grant or continue an injunction when the information the plaintiff wished to prevent becoming public knowledge was already in the public domain. In Spycatcher, Wright had charted his life in MI5, and named a former director general as a Russian agent. It was an allegation hotly and officially denied. The book had been on sale in Scotland and abroad, and copies were not confiscated when they were brought into England. \u201cIn my opinion, artificially to restrict the readership of a widely accessible book in this way is unacceptable if the information is in the public domain,\u201d Goff wrote.</p> <p>Among other positions out of court, Goff was chairman of the Council of Legal Education (1976-82), chairman of the court of London University (1986-91), and chair of the Pegasus Scholarship Trust (1987-2001), a programme that allowed the interchange of young American and English attorneys and barristers.</p> <p>He regularly participated in House of Lords debates as a crossbencher. In 1999 he was awarded the Grand Cross (First Class) of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany for his contribution to British awareness of German law. That year also saw the publication of <a href=\"https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/The_Search_for_Principle.html?id=fZ2DQgAACAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y\"> The Search for Principle: Essays in Honour of Lord Goff of Chieveley</a>.</p> <p>Away from the law, his love of and talent for music, particularly Mozart, enabled him to arrange classical pieces for his children, Katherine, Thomas and Juliet, to play.</p> <p>In 1953 he married Sarah Cousins. She survives him, along with their children. Another son, William, died in infancy.</p> <p><em>\u2022 </em>Robert Lionel Archibald Goff, Lord Goff of Chieveley, judge, born 12 November 1926; died 14 August 2016</p>",

The company\u2019s shares were largely unaffected by the ruling. c</p> <p>The political fallout from the row also looks likely to continue for months, if not years. The US treasury <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/aug/24/apple-taxes-european-commission\">warned last week</a> that it would \u201cconsider potential responses\u201d if the EU pushed ahead with its plans to claw back tax from Apple. A <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/tax-policy/treaties/Documents/White-Paper-State-Aid.pdf\">white paper commissioned by US treasury secretary Jack Lew</a> warned that Brussels was overstepping its powers and becoming a \u201csupranational tax authority\u201d.</p> <p>But there continues to be political controversy in the US over the corporate tax code: some decry high rates of taxation while others say there are too many methods, such as Apple\u2019s Irish tax regime, allowing US companies to move their wealth overseas.</p> <p>It is not yet clear which side will be backed by either of the 2016 presidential candidates. Republican Donald Trump has broken with conservative orthodoxy by saying he would force US companies, Apple in particular, to <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.wired.com/2016/03/trump-wont-get-apple-make-iphones-shouldnt/\">move manufacturing jobs within the nation\u2019s own borders</a>, rather than allowing them to seek cheaper labor overseas; he has also said he would lower the US corporate tax rate in order to make sure US companies brought their business back to America. </p> <p>His Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, has also hinted that she might lower the corporate tax rate and has said she would move to stop US firms merging with foreign rivals to take advantage of tax loopholes. But she also has closer ties to Apple than Trump. Apple CEO Tim Cook held <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://venturebeat.com/2016/08/24/apple-ceo-tim-cook-hosting-fundraising-dinner-for-hillary-clinton-tonight/\">a fundraiser for Clinton</a> on 24 August.</p> <p>Apple\u2019s Irish tax affairs were first highlighted by a senators Carl Levin and John McCain in 2013. The duo then led the Senate subcommittee on investigations.</p> <p>Levin, who now serves on the faculty of Wayne State University Law School in Detroit as distinguished legislator in residence, said: \u201cThe royalties Apple collects for its overseas sales of products designed and developed in the US should be taxed in the US. But Apple has avoided the billions of dollars of taxes it owes the US by transferring its intellectual property to itself in Ireland.</p> <p>\u201cThe IRS [internal revenue service] has failed to stake a claim for US taxes on those revenues for a decade or more. It has been passive and so Europe attempts to fill the vacuum. Shame on Apple for dodging US taxes. Shame on the IRS for failing to challenge Apple\u2019s tax avoidance.\u201d</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.aba.org.uk/About-the-ABA/More-About-the-ABA/Past-Presidents/ABA-Past-Presidents-1950-1960/Alan-G-Thomas\">Alan Thomas</a>, one of the great English booksellers, once said that \u201cbookselling was perhaps the last profession where a man could control his destiny\u201d. After nearly 50 years at the job, I find this statement absolutely true.<br></p> <p>Booksellers are a fascinating and sometimes eccentric lot of individuals, most of whom have fallen into the trade from an extremely wide variety of backgrounds: some from teaching at the highest levels of academia, others from peddling books at flea markets. </p> <p>My start came in the mid-1960s, shortly after I returned to Canada from an adventurous decade hitchhiking through Europe. While I couldn\u2019t find work applying the bookbinding skills I learned in Spain, the craft did introduce me to Toronto\u2019s used and rare bookselling community. Seeing how interesting their trade was, I undertook an apprenticeship before founding my own store, David Mason Books, in 1967. A lifetime of reading turned out to be the perfect background for the job.<br></p> <p>Being a bookseller has allowed me to own books \u2013 at least temporarily \u2013 that only the rich can afford. I once held the <a href=\"http://www.bl.uk/collection-items/the-kelmscott-chaucer\">Kelmscott Chaucer</a> (valued at around $100,000), and a presentation copy of Darwin\u2019s On the Origin of Species, which today might bring $250,000 in the market. In retrospect, though, these figures matter far less than the interactions I\u2019ve had with buyers, sellers, and collectors from around the world, most of whom are learned and charming characters. </p> <p>Despite decades immersed in the used and rare book trade, I never imagined writing a book of my own. This changed, however, when my friend and editor, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Metcalf_%28writer%29\">John Metcalf</a>, suggested I write a memoir on my career. I was sceptical but flattered, especially since he offered to edit the work. I didn\u2019t believe I could fill a book, but in the end I would have filled two if it weren\u2019t for Metcalf. Working with him was an amazing experience. </p> <p>Since the first edition of <a href=\"http://news.nationalpost.com/arts/books/book-reviews/book-review-the-popes-bookbinder-by-david-mason\">The Pope\u2019s Bookbinder</a> was published in 2013, I had a profound change of view in regards to an incident I had left out of the original: the story of the great Hemingway Heist, which took place at my store in 1993.</p> <p>The Heist involved the theft of books by Hemingway, plus letters between him, F Scott Fitzgerald, and the Canadian writer <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/biography/Morley-Callaghan\">Morley Callaghan</a>, all relating to the famous boxing match between Hemingway and Callaghan, with Fitzgerald as the timekeeper. <a href=\"http://fightland.vice.com/blog/hemingway-vs-callaghan-the-greatest-literary-boxing-feud-of-all-time\">The match took place in Paris during the summer of 1929</a>, and resulted in Callaghan knocking Hemingway down. The subsequent furore caused a huge literary scandal and fractured the friendships of the three writers.</p> <p>After receiving the books and letters, I locked them in a store safe. When I opened my shop the next day, I was shocked to discover the safe had been cracked. Except for the letters, very little else of value was taken; it seems clear the thieves were after those artefacts specifically. The case grew stranger when a street criminal was arrested with one of the stolen postcards from the lot in his possession. Soon after confessing that he was part of the crew who robbed the store, he was found dead in his cell \u2013 a puzzling suicide. Upon his death, the case went cold.</p> <p>The original price I asked for the archive of books and letters was $250,000 Canadian dollars (\u00a3146,000); they could easily realise $1m (\u00a3590,000) in today\u2019s market. But what continues to haunt me is not their monetary value, but their historical value. After reading both Norman Mailer\u2019s early pieces on Hemingway and the brilliant analysis of Hemingway\u2019s psychology in Paul Johnson\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1989/03/12/books/the-great-unwashed.html?pagewanted=all\">Intellectuals</a>, I realised that, after 25 years, the theft had passed from being a simple (though major) robbery to a blight on the history of two of the most significant writers in 20th century American literature.</p> <p>Unless or until these major artefacts are found, the theft will continue to mark one of the most tantalising literary losses of the 20th century, alongside an early unfinished draft of TE Lawrence\u2019s Seven Pillars of Wisdom and, back to Hemingway, the early manuscripts of his that his first wife misplaced on a train.</p> <p>I purposely omitted relating the story of the theft because, in spite of the bizarre details, it had no resolution. Today the stolen items remain missing \u2013 a tantalising and romantic challenge in antiquarian bookselling. Booksellers, who think of themselves as \u201cscouts\u201d, are on a perpetual quest for such literary treasures. I continue to hope that someday, some knowledgable seeker will happen upon these letters that I \u2013 and many passionate scholars \u2013 have waited 25 years to reclaim for the literary record.</p> <h2>Extract</h2> <blockquote> <blockquote> <p>There have been quite a few different versions given of that famous fight between Morley Callaghan and Hemingway, most of them composed by Hemingway himself, his varied accounts becoming increasingly bizarre over time. I think it\u2019s safe to say that the most accurate one is that given in Callaghan\u2019s memoir, That Summer in Paris. A close reading of it shows that Callaghan had no axe to grind. He was a man singularly lacking in vanity and pretension. I never saw any signs in my many conversations with him of any bitterness or spite at Hemingway\u2019s grotesque behaviour and manipulations of the truth.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <br> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>I can picture Morley again saying such things to me in his living room. \u201cHe couldn\u2019t help doing these things, don\u2019t you know,\u201d he\u2019d say, sadly shaking his head. </p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <br> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>Morley ended many sentences with that earnest \u201cdon\u2019t you know,\u201d or \u201cdon\u2019t you see.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>And we usually did see. What we also saw was the warmth and generosity of spirit of that wonderful old man. I often got the impression that he felt he had to excuse and forgive Hemingway out of admiration for his great gifts. </p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <br> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>But again we are faced with the importance of these missing letters. It was Morley\u2019s sympathy for Mary Hemingway\u2019s feelings which caused him to leave out the parts that literary history needs. Which we are now deprived of.</p> </blockquote> </blockquote> <p>From The Pope\u2019s Bookbinder: A Memoir by David Mason, published by <a href=\"http://www.biblioasis.com\">Biblioasis</a> and used by permission of the publisher.

The internet is an important part of the British economy but it is not necessarily where and how you gain power. In the 2015 general election, Labour\u2019s hubristic reliance on the social media echo chamber was one of the reasons it believed it was on course to win. It was wrong \u2014 and the team of Ed Miliband, Mr Corbyn\u2019s predecessor, was humiliated.</p> <p>There is no evidence that this has changed in the past year, and Mr Corbyn\u2019s promise to run \u201cthe most visible general election campaign ever\u201d confirms he does not have a strategy to counter the party\u2019s electioneering failures.

One of the proposals in his <em>Digital Democracy Manifesto</em> would be to end \u201cunjustified surveillance by CCTV\u201d, he said. Those of us who got the reference to Richard Branson\u2019s use of footage from CCTV on a Virgin train to attack the Labour leader could only applaud inwardly. Or would have done if the live video stream from the event hadn\u2019t gone down. </p> <p>I, for one, admire Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s attempt to restore the glory days of Windows 95, when the internet was swashbuckling and free and people spelled online with a hyphen. I share his vision of the information superhighway, based on high-speed dial-up for all. In particular, I like his idea for an Open Knowledge Library: if only someone could think of a catchy name for millions of computers all over the world, all connected to each other and sharing information without charge.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57c59acfe4b0f6cb856287a7\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-30T14:46:22.452Z\">3.46pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Hope Not Hate</strong>, the anti-racism campaign, is organising dozens of \u201cMore in Common\u201d community events around the UK this weekend to honour the values of the Labour MP Jo Cox who was killed in June.

The Nobel Prize-winning economist sits on Nicola Sturgeon\u2019s council of economic advisers and he said that Scotland should consider having its own currency if it opts for independence. Before the 2014 referendum the Scottish government\u2019s fiscal commission working group (part of the council of economic advisers) proposed an independent Scotland having a currency union with the rest of the UK. But this may have been a mistake, Stiglitz said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>They wanted the smoothest transition possible. They wanted to say that we could move from the current economic arrangement to another one while keeping our currency and keeping other forms of institutions. I think, in hindsight, that may have been a mistake. </p> <p>It would be a mistake to join the euro, by the way, so what they would have needed to do, perhaps, was resurrect the Scottish pound and let it float. </p> <p>Small countries can have their own currency. The reason that Iceland, which had one of the deepest downturns in 2008, had one of the strongest recoveries was because it had its own currency.</p> <p>If there was a Scottish pound floating, you could help stimulate the Scottish economy. The deficit would come down to make it acceptable to joining the EU. </p> </blockquote> <p>Countries that join the EU - as an SNP-led independent Scotland would want to do, if by then the UK had left - are meant to commit to joining the euro. But Stiglitz said he thought the EU could make an exception to this rule for Scotland.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I think there\u2019s going to be, going forward, a greater willingness - I hope there is a greater willingness - within Europe for countries to be a member of the EU but not have the euro. Sweden doesn\u2019t have the euro, obviously the UK did not have the euro before, so they have shown some willingness - a concerned willingness - to accept countries into the EU without joining the euro.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57c574f7e4b0df5f040dbcb9\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-30T12:00:12.989Z\">1.00pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Meanwhile <strong>Owen Smith</strong>, who is challenging Jeremy Corbyn for the Labour leadership, has launched a campaign bus today.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/owensmith2016/status/770541863979913216\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The Owen Smith campaign bus launched today in Pontypridd for a tour of every nation and region of Britain. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Owen2016?src=hash\">#Owen2016</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/rTL6XNyz1i\">pic.twitter.com/rTL6XNyz1i</a></p>&mdash; Owen Smith 2016 (@owensmith2016) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/owensmith2016/status/770541863979913216\">August 30, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/owensmith2016/status/770569622110269440\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">First stop of the day: Bristol! \ud83d\ude8c <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Owen2016?src=hash\">#Owen2016</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/nQYTu1jir6\">pic.twitter.com/nQYTu1jir6</a></p>&mdash; Owen Smith 2016 (@owensmith2016) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/owensmith2016/status/770569622110269440\">August 30, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57c56e62e4b04fe839bc4f1c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-30T11:51:11.758Z\">12.51pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here is some Twitter comment from journalists on Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s digital democracy manifesto.</p> <p>From BuzzFeed\u2019s <strong>James Ball</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/jamesrbuk/status/770555337862701056\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Corbyn&#39;s digital manifesto contains nothing about online harrassment .

This investment could be funded at minimal cost to the taxpayer and with the most rapid deployment possible, using the National Investment Bank and relying on all-time low government borrowing costs. The provision of a valuable national asset would produce significant returns over time, both in economic growth and additional tax revenues arising from growth, far outweighing the initial investment. Building on existing fibre-optic roll-out schemes would reduce the total costs below this headline figure, and building on current practice we would look to schedule installations where the demand was urgent, such as to existing tech clusters.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"85fd3430d53300d5778df9c6b485b1fd058fb8ac\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/85fd3430d53300d5778df9c6b485b1fd058fb8ac/0_3_831_499/500.jpg\" alt=\"Jeremy Corbyn\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jeremy Corbyn</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57c556d2e4b09fcabd06d2be\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-30T09:52:59.307Z\">10.52am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Jeremy Corbyn's digital democracy speech</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Jeremy Corbyn</strong> is speaking now.</p> <p>He says 20 years ago this speech would have been prepared at a desktop, at best.

Excellent advice for aspiring home-help robots or faithful canines; not so much for 21st-century women who don\u2019t despise themselves or want to burn everything.</p> <p>Metro\u2019s \u201c17 killer mistakes\u201d list included helpful tips for how not to behave on a first date, such as \u201cThere is such a thing as too much makeup\u201d, \u201cDon\u2019t mention your parents\u201d, \u201cLet\u2019s not have sex on the first date\u201d, and \u201cDon\u2019t think it\u2019s sexist that we offer to pay the bill\u201d. Women were also advised not to \u201ctell us to order what we feel like, then get a salad from the starters after we\u2019ve just asked for a rump steak\u201d, a <a href=\"http://magazine.foxnews.com/food-wellness/15-sexy-foods-order-date\">variation on the infinite and contradictory rules out there about whether a woman can or can\u2019t eat salad on a date</a>. Thanks internet!</p> <p>The latest offering \u2013 \u201cHow to talk to a woman who is wearing headphones\u201d \u2013 advised men to attract the attention of said women using much the same approach as an alien trying to blend in without arousing suspicion. </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>1. Stand in front of her (with 1m to 1.5m between you).<br>2. Have a relaxed, easygoing smile.<br>3. Is she hasn\u2019t already looked up at you, simply get her attention with a wave of your hand. Wave your hand in her direct line of vision so she can\u2019t ignore it.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>Swoon. Excuse me while I go take a quick cold shower.</p> <p>While there may be some women out there who would be delighted at this approach and immediately request marriage, the majority (judging from the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=headphones&amp;src=typd\">response on Twitter</a>), might find it annoying, scary, entitled, or just downright rude. Given the amount of time women already spend <a href=\"http://www.endviolenceagainstwomen.org.uk/news/234/85-of-younger-women-in-uk-have-been-sexually-harassed-in-public \">fending off unwanted sexual advances</a>, and the fact that many actively use headphones as a deliberate tactic to avoid them, an instructional piece encouraging men to invade our privacy is pretty much the last thing we need. <br></p> <p>Yet, apparently, modern daters are in desperate need of guidance. So here\u2019s an alternative list of simple tips on how to talk to/date/generally interact with a woman without being a total idiot.</p> <ul> <li>Try to think about a woman as if she were a real-life human person. If you would find it weird to have someone wave their hand in front of your face with a fixed smile as you walk to work, the chances are she might, too.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Don\u2019t do things to women that you would find annoying if done to you. This includes, but is not limited to, making unsolicited comments about body parts, musing aloud about fornicating with them, or shouting out ratings out of 10.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>If paying the bill on a first date is the entire basis for your masculine sense of self, get help. Consider counselling, or have a nice long chat about self-worth with a friend or colleague.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>You can\u2019t judge a woman on her weight AND get angry if she orders a salad \u2013 that\u2019s just counter-intuitive. Try to work out in advance which sexist stereotype is most important to you, and stick with it.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Remember that judging us on whether or not we want to have sex on a first date is the absolute number one most guaranteed way to turn us on. Women just love those sexist societal double standards. Lots of sex ahead for you.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Acceptable reasons to approach a woman with headphones in: if she\u2019s about to step into a puddle, dog poo or the path of an oncoming car. If she is on fire and has not yet realised it.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Unacceptable reasons to approach a woman with headphones on: anything else. Don\u2019t. Stop it.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>When you find a helpful article about how to approach women wearing headphones, first check whether it is published <a href=\"http://www.themodernman.com\">on a website</a> that says it can teach you: \u201cWhat to say to turn a woman on and make her want to have sex with you ASAP\u201d, followed by: \u201cThis is very easy to do. You\u2019ve got to try it!\u201d Also check if said website sells a 10-hour long video called <a href=\"https://store.themodernman.com/get_your_ex_back_super_system.html\">\u201cGet your ex back: super system\u201d</a>. Do not take advice about women from this website. <br></li> </ul>",
  "<p>Geopolitics is really starting to mess with my autumn/winter wardrobe. While the UN conveniently sits in silence, government officials around the world can\u2019t seem to shut up about what women should or shouldn\u2019t wear. </p> <p>India\u2019s tourism minister, for example, has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/29/india-female-tourists-skirts-safety-advice\">just advised</a> that foreign women shouldn\u2019t wear skirts \u201cfor their own safety\u201d. Meanwhile a number of French mayors are nobly continuing to ban the burkini even after France\u2019s highest administrative court ruled the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/28/french-mayors-burkini-ban-court-ruling\">ban illegal</a>. These mayors care about women\u2019s right to bare arms and are willing to break the law for it. Ladies, you should be grateful.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Is a skort as dangerous as a skirt? Is a sarong just as wrong?</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>And I certainly don\u2019t want to sound ungrateful. I think it\u2019s great that politicians understand that women\u2019s rights are often simply a matter of the right sort of clothing. It\u2019s laudable that so many men are encouraging us to exercise sartorial safety. But here\u2019s the thing: if you\u2019re going to become the fashion police you need to take your policing a little more seriously. All of this advice is very confusing, occasionally conflicting and doesn\u2019t seem terribly well thought out. Is a skort as dangerous as a skirt, for example? Is a sarong just as wrong? And can we have an official verdict on the burkini already before burkini season is over?</p> <p>I\u2019m sure a lot of women are as concerned about inadvertently dressing inappropriately as I am. So while we wait for the UN to get their act together and sort out some sort of official female dress code we can all abide by, I\u2019ve put together some pointers on dressing while female. Please note, of course, that these are only guidelines and you should always double-check your outfit with a man. </p> <h2><strong>Bikinis in Israel</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"689562ddd21c6390812a2094a2d076737fc10ada\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/689562ddd21c6390812a2094a2d076737fc10ada/0_178_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Muslim women wear hijabs in the waters of the Mediterranean Sea as people play on the beach in Tel Aviv, Israel on 22 August 2016.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Muslim women wear hijabs in the waters of the Mediterranean Sea as people play on the beach in Tel Aviv, Israel, on 22 August 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Baz Ratner/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>While the French are saying <em>non</em> to burkinis, their sluttier sister, the bikini, appears equally out of fashion in Israel.

If you work for Virgin Atlantic, however, then your right to wear trousers is considered on a case-by-case basis. And Etihad doesn\u2019t have a trouser option for its female flight crew. Ettore Bilotta, who designed the Etihad uniform, <a href=\"https://www.runwaygirlnetwork.com/2015/01/24/etihads-women-cabin-crew-forbidden-wear-trousers/\">told the press</a> that: \u201cFemales in the inflight crew were not allowed to wear trousers, because the element of femininity had to be emphasised.\u201d If there isn\u2019t enough femininity in the cabin it can really mess with in-flight safety, I guess.</p> <h2><strong>Flats at a film festival</strong></h2> <p>The second biggest fashion faux pas in Cannes, after a burkini, is having the audacity to try and attend Cannes Film Festival in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/may/19/cannes-backlash-high-heels-emily-blunt-flat-shoes\">rhinestone flats.</a> It doesn\u2019t matter if part of your foot has been amputated, nobody wants your excuses.

Kazakhstan has issues like the shrinking of the Aral Sea, the devaluation of its currency and radioactive contamination to deal with, but it took time out of its busy schedule to focus on panties. Sometimes women are so ungrateful.</p> <h2><strong>Leggings or yoga pants in the US</strong></h2> <p>Not appropriate in a number of American high schools, apparently.

So for now Montana remains a largely Lululemon safe zone.</p> <h2><strong>Miniskirts in Uganda</strong></h2> <p>In 2014, Uganda attempted to ban the miniskirt. A number of men tried to help the government out by forcefully undressing any women they saw wearing miniskirts in public. Eventually the Ugandan government was forced to clarify that the miniskirt wasn\u2019t entirely banned. Simon Lokodo, Uganda\u2019s ethics and integrity minister, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/apr/05/uganda-ban-miniskirts-womens-right\">clarified</a>: \u201cPut on a miniskirt but please don\u2019t expose your thighs, your buttocks and your genitalia.

I\u2019m not saying that I am going to finish it.\u201d</p> <p>After the radio interview, LePage indicated on Twitter that anticipation for his resignation was premature. <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://twitter.com/Governor_LePage/status/770662267834736641\">He wrote</a>: \u201cThe reports of my political demise are greatly exaggerated,\u201d nodding to the legendary Mark Twain quotation.</p> <p>The governor\u2019s term ends in 2019.

LePage ranks in the bottom 10 of America\u2019s least popular governors with an approval rating of 38%, as of a<a href=\"https://morningconsult.com/state-governor-rankings/\"> May study</a>. </p> <p>On Wednesday, LePage claimed that \u201cthe majority\u201d of drug dealers arrested in Maine are black or Latino. He said: \u201cLook, the bad guy is the bad guy. I don\u2019t care what color he is. When you go to war, if you know the enemy and the enemy dresses in red and you dress in blue, then you shoot at red.\u201d</p> <p>When LePage\u2019s remarks prompted a critical response from Drew Gattine, a Democratic state representative, the governor told reporters he left Gattine a threatening voicemail full of expletives.

LePage\u2019s style and unwillingness to back down when speaking about race have drawn comparisons to his party\u2019s presidential nominee Donald Trump.

Well, I have a couple of long words for you, Paxman: gerascophobia and gerontophobia. He seems to be suffering from both a fear of getting old and of older people. With any luck he will live to a good age and realise that there are many benefits that come with longevity, but only if he accepts that life is there to be enjoyed, not feared.</p> <p>There are countless examples of older people continuing to contribute to our lives, such as Paxman himself, and many of our readers continue to develop, challenge and stretch their minds and bodies. Age often brings wisdom and experience, which is one of the many reasons why ageism has no place in our society.

  "<p>Apple has warned that future investment by multinationals in Europe could be hit after it was ordered to pay a record-breaking \u20ac13bn (\u00a311bn) in back taxes to Ireland.</p> <p>The world\u2019s largest company was presented with the huge bill after the European commission ruled that a sweetheart tax deal between Apple and the Irish tax authorities amounted to illegal state aid.</p> <p>The commission said the deal allowed Apple to pay a maximum tax rate of just 1%. In 2014, the tech firm paid tax at just 0.005%. The usual rate of corporation tax in Ireland is 12.5%.</p> <p>\u201cMember states cannot give tax benefits to selected companies \u2013 this is illegal under EU state aid rules,\u201d said the European competition commissioner, Margrethe Vestager, whose investigation of Apple\u2019s complex tax dealings has taken three years.</p> <p>Vestager\u2019s ruling prompted an angry response from Apple and from Ireland and is likely to spark a political row between the US and the EU. The US Treasury said the ruling threatened to damage \u201cthe important spirit of economic partnership between the US and the EU\u201d.</p> <p>In a letter to customers, Apple\u2019s chief executive, Tim Cook, claimed the ruling could deal a blow to big companies investing in Europe: \u201cBeyond the obvious targeting of Apple, the most profound and harmful effect of this ruling will be on investment and job creation in Europe. Using the commission\u2019s theory, every company in Ireland and across Europe is suddenly at risk of being subjected to taxes under laws that never existed.\u201d</p> <p>The commission said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/14/ireland-abolish-double-irish-tax-scheme-apple\">Ireland\u2019s tax arrangements</a> with Apple between 1991 and 2015 had allowed the US company to attribute sales to a \u201chead office\u201d that only existed on paper and could not have generated such profits. </p> <p>The result was that Apple avoided tax on almost all the profit generated from its multi-billion euro sales of iPhones and other products across the EU\u2019s single market. It booked the profits in Ireland rather than the country in which the product was sold. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/08/corporation_tax-zip/giv-310755cLl2nFXyVR4/\" data-alt=\"Corporation tax rates in Europe\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/08/corporation_tax-zip/giv-310755cLl2nFXyVR4/\">Corporation tax rates in Europe</a> <figcaption>Corporation tax rates in Europe.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Apple and Ireland said they intend to appeal against the ruling. </p> <p>The figure of \u20ac13bn plus interest is 40 times the previous record for such a case and the equivalent of the annual budget for Ireland\u2019s health service.

He said Apple chose the Irish city of Cork as its European base 30 years ago and had expanded from 60 workers to almost 6,000 in Ireland. </p> <p>He said Apple would appeal and that he was confident of winning.</p> <p>Cook said: \u201cWe never asked for, nor did we receive, any special deals. We now find ourselves in the unusual position of being ordered to retroactively pay additional taxes to a government that says we don\u2019t owe them any more than we\u2019ve already paid.\u201d</p> <p>The commission\u2019s decision is a rebuff to US efforts to persuade it to drop the case after warnings of retaliation from Washington.<strong> </strong></p> <p>Apple, which changed its tax arrangements with Ireland in 2015, should easily be able to pay the huge tax bill because it has a cash mountain of more than $230bn (\u00a3176bn) of cash and securities, mostly held outside the US. The tech group keeps the money outside the US because it would be forced to pay US tax charges if it repatriated the money.</p> <p>The \u20ac13bn figure covers only the 10 years before the commission first requested information in 2013. The commission, which does not have the authority to go back any further, said it was up to Ireland to collect the tax from Apple.</p> <p>The Irish government, however,<strong> </strong>wants the ruling reversed because it wants to preserve <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/05/ireland-attracts-soaring-level-of-us-investment\">its status as a low-tax base for overseas companies</a>.</p> <p>Ireland\u2019s finance minister, Michael Noonan, said Dublin would appeal against the ruling. He said: \u201cThe decision leaves me with no choice but to seek cabinet approval to appeal. This is necessary to defend the integrity of our tax system, to provide tax certainty to business and to challenge the encroachment of EU state aid rules into the sovereign member state competence of taxation.\u201d</p> <p>A cabinet meeting will be held in Dublin on Wednesday to discuss the fallout from the ruling.<strong> </strong>At the heart of the Fine Gael-led administration\u2019s objections is that it would cause Ireland reputational damage in the eyes of other mainly US multinationals thinking of establishing their European base in the Republic.</p> <p>Fine Gael, the main opposition party Fianna F\u00e1il, and a host of independent deputies serving as ministers in the coalition government support the low-tax regime for multinationals because it has created hundreds of thousands of jobs.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/shortcuts/2016/aug/30/nine-ways-ireland-could-spend-apple-13bn-payback\">A tunnel to Wales or a gallery full of Gauguins: how Ireland could spend Apple\u2019s money</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Richard Murphy, a tax campaigner and a professor in international political economy at City University in London, said: \u201cThis is a great day for the sovereignty of the EU\u2019s nations when it comes to tax. They will now be able to choose their own tax policies knowing another state should not be consciously undermining them when doing so. The Irish state has for too long been committed to tax abuse, unfair competition and secrecy, all of which are designed to undermine fair competition and increase inequality.\u201d<br></p> <p>Prof Louise Gracia of Warwick University business school said: \u201cThis ruling is a serious attempt at curtailing the power large multinationals have in avoiding their tax liabilities, and sends a warning to countries that facilitate hard-edged corporate tax minimisation strategies.\u201d</p> <p>She added: \u201cIt also shines a spotlight on the paltry levels of corporate tax that large multinationals are actually paying. Even if we accept the job and wealth creation arguments put forward by multinationals as mitigation against tax liability, this has to be within reason.\u201d</p> <p>Toby Quantrill, Christian Aid\u2019s principal adviser on economic justice, said: \u201cThe staggering amount of money at stake here suggests that millions of citizens are paying a painfully high price for multinationals\u2019 cosy tax deals with certain governments.</p> <p>\u201cThis is not a one-off situation \u2013 it is part of a damaging race to the bottom in which governments are competing on who can offer multinationals the lowest tax bill. It\u2019s time to get multinationals\u2019 tax affairs out in the open, so we can all see how much they are actually contributing to the rest of society.\u201d </p> <p>In the US Peter Kenny, senior market strategist at Global Markets Advisory Group, said it was not yet clear which side would ultimately prevail, but that the ruling was a watershed moment. \u201cThere\u2019s no telling whether the verdict will stand on appeal, but we know that the landscape is changing for US corporations in the EU.\u201d </p> <p>He described Vestager\u2019s ruling as \u201cjust the tip of the spear \u2013 an enormously important ruling\u201d because US-based companies \u201chave traditionally used the EU as a way of circumventing a higher US corporate tax code.\u201d</p> <p>Apple\u2019s share price, however, was largely unmoved. In a note to investors, Gene Munster, analyst at Piper Jaffray, said the \u20ac13bn potential bill was not a big deal for the huge company. <strong>\u201c</strong>While the penalty is large in absolute terms, it represents a small portion of AAPL\u2019s [Apple\u2019s] overall valuation.\u201d</p> <p>It is not yet clear which side will be backed by either of the 2016 presidential candidates. Republican Donald Trump has said he would force US companies, Apple in particular, to <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2016/03/trump-wont-get-apple-make-iphones-shouldnt/\">move manufacturing jobs within the nation\u2019s own borders</a>, rather than allowing them to seek cheaper labour overseas.

  "<p>New diesel cars are still emitting many times the official limit for polluting nitrogen oxides when driven on the road, almost a year after the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/16/volkswagen-emissions-scandal-criminal-evidence\">Volkswagen emissions scandal</a> broke.</p> <p>Renault, Mercedes-Benz, Mazda and Hyundai have all launched diesel models in 2016 with NOx emissions that are far higher than the official lab-based test when driven in real-world conditions, according to <a href=\"http://equa.emissionsanalytics.com/equa-air-quality-index/\">tests by Emissions Analytics</a> (EA), a company whose data is used by the manufacturers of most cars sold in Europe.</p> <p>Ironically, the only new model to meet the limit when on the road was a Volkswagen Tiguan.</p> <p>Diesel cars must pass lab-based tests for NOx emissions but most cars perform far worse in the real world and in 2015 Volkswagen was caught using software to cheat the tests. Previous EA analysis showed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/23/diesel-cars-pollution-limits-nox-emissions\">97% of diesels launched since 2009 exceeded the lab limit</a>.</p> <p>NOx pollution is a serious public health problem, causing the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/sep/13/government-passing-the-buck-air-pollution-campaigners\">early deaths of 23,500 people a year</a> in the UK alone. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/30/uk-air-quality-shows-little-improvement-past-20-years-says-study\">New research</a> presented on Tuesday suggests the air pollution crisis in UK cities has not been tackled because politicians prioritise economic growth and road safety instead.</p> <p>The EU has tightened emissions regulations and, from September 2017, diesels that emit more than double the lab limit for NOx on the road will be banned from sale.</p> <p>The Emissions Analytics\u2019 road test is very similar to the new test the EU is implementing and it found that 2016 Renault Megane (1.5l engine) and Espace (1.6l) diesel models emitted more than 12 times the NOx lab limit in real-world driving. </p> <p>A Mercedes Benz CLA (2.1l) diesel emitted 8-12 times the limit on the road, while a Mazda 3 (1.5l) and Hyundai Sante Fe (2.2l) emitted 6-8 times the limit. Until the testing regime changes in 2017, it is legal to sell such high emitters. In contrast to the other vehicles, the road emissions of the Volkswagen Tiguan (2.0l) met the lab limit for new cars.</p> <p>\u201cDiesels can be clean,\u201d said Nick Molden, the EA\u2019s chief executive. \u201cIt is about getting a [regulatory] system that forces deployment of the technology.\u201d </p> <p>Molden said the continued sale of highly polluting diesels reflected the struggle of some manufacturers to catch up and implement the emissions-reducing technology. Other carmakers, he said, have the technology in their cars already but are calibrating their engines to maximise fuel efficiency, at the expense of high NOx emissions. </p> <p>But some, such as VW, had already delivered on the most recent standard, called Euro 6, Molden said. \u201cThere is a massive irony, given that VW are the ones that have been caught. But their Euro 6 cars from the get-go have been very clean and they came in before \u2018dieselgate\u2019 blew. It is an even bigger irony than it first looks - they had already cleaned themselves up before they got found out.\u201d</p> <p>Julia Poliscanova, from the campaign group Transport and Environment, said: \u201cThe current regulatory climate in Europe sees testing authorities protecting carmakers and allowing polluting vehicles to be sold, even after dieselgate.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNew on-road tests after 2017 will help and are the only way to measure accurate real-world emissions,\u201d she said. \u201cBut more action is necessary. In the short term governments must stand up for their citizens\u2019 health and order mandatory recalls to bring illegally dirty cars in compliance. </p> <p>\u201cIn the long term, more independent oversight, transparency and robust testing over vehicles\u2019 lifetimes are necessary for Europeans to finally enjoy the cleaner air promised to them almost 10 years ago.\u201d</p> <p>Tamzen Isacsson, from the UK trade body The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT), said: \u201cWe can\u2019t comment on results from non-official tests where the robustness or methodology is unclear. However, SMMT and industry acknowledge the need for reform of the EU test process.</p> <p>\u201cWe support the introduction next year of a more onerous lab test that better reflects real world driving, together with an on-road Real Driving Emissions (RDE) test. This will be the world\u2019s toughest emissions testing regime.\u201d</p> <p>A spokeswoman for Hyundai said: \u201cHyundai Motor vehicles on sale in the UK meet all the current regulatory standards. New Euro 6 cars are built using the best available technology and they produce less NOx emissions than their predecessors. </p> <p>\u201cHyundai Motor takes environmental compliance extremely seriously and is committed to meeting forthcoming new targets and to significantly improving the environmental performance of its vehicles.\u201d</p> <p>Spokesmen for Mercedes-Benz and Mazda said they were unable to comment on unofficial tests. The spokesman for Mazda added: \u201cIn compliance with the law, Mazda works hard to ensure that every petrol and diesel engine it makes fully complies with the regulations of the countries in which they are sold.\u201d </p> <p>Renault did not respond to requests for comment.</p> <p>Molden said the new regime in 2017 would probably mean diesels at the smaller end of the range would no longer be sold: \u201cSome of these cars will be discontinued because the after-treatment system will just be too expensive as a proportion of the total price to work commercially. But from mid-sized cars upwards it can be done. We are talking about adding hundreds of pounds per [car], not thousands.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>I have a long-held secret, but it is time to reveal it and give up on my dreams.

It is an addictive sensation: bold and blinding, beautiful and horrible in equal measure. If I could go again tomorrow I would, but it takes at least four years and a considerable chunk of your soul to earn that spot on the start line.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/13/britain-men-s-eight-row-olympic-gold-glory-women-silver\" title=\"\">race itself</a> flew by in a blur of perfection. I knew my crew were capable of big things but we had to do it on the day, when it really mattered. I share a common trait among the team: an obsessive eye for improvement. This unflinching commitment to ceaselessly perfect my rowing is compatible with the high-performance programme we follow. Every detail is torn apart and every performance analysed to yield the next speed gain.</p> <p>This perhaps explains the strangeness I felt after the Olympic final. There was very little I would change about how we executed that race. The smallest of details that I did pick up on did not matter. We had won the big one. The one that mattered. The one that I had strived for over so many years. In an instance that machine-like process had stopped. I no longer needed to analyse or to perfect. The end product had been reached. The regimented and planned timetable of training no longer existed. I was free.</p> <p>It is akin to line-dancing off a cliff. For nearly a decade coaches had mapped out every stage of my training. Every session was programmed, every day accounted for, and then abruptly the race was over, and it all stopped. It is disorienting: an alien sense of freedom, tinged with loss.</p> <p>On crossing the finish line the sensation was unexpected. I was aware of what had happened but I felt somehow detached. I knew everyone was celebrating and going crazy, but by contrast I was still. I don\u2019t understand why this was the case. It was as if my body were empty, or completely drained, and it felt as if I watched all this from outside of my body. I could hardly feel anything. On the landing stage I felt like a ghost. The effort was total, and I was exhausted. We had brought everything we had to those five minutes and 29 seconds of racing. I felt sick and disoriented. I think I was so overwhelmed by the experience I had no energy left to process what was happening. At some point someone sat me down and placed an ice pack on the back of my head/neck. The ice was bliss. It returned the world to focus. I knew this feeling, as surreal as it was, trumped the devastation of four years ago. In London 2012, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/aug/01/london-2012-mens-eight-win-bronze\" title=\"\">we had led the Olympic final but were rowed down by two crews</a>, and the bronze medal felt a very bitter type of bittersweet.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"54a5139153474a8a6fa780efbbbfcd247bc7b27a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/54a5139153474a8a6fa780efbbbfcd247bc7b27a/0_69_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tom Ransley top row, second from left: \u2018In some ways to be awarded the gold medal felt as surreal as if I found myself sitting beside Goldilocks eating porridge with the three bears.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tom Ransley top row, second from left: \u2018In some ways to be awarded the gold medal felt as surreal as if I found myself sitting beside Goldilocks eating porridge with the three bears.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mike Egerton/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This time, standing on the podium I pondered a truly surreal experience. It had all the trappings of an Olympic prize-giving. I was being awarded the Olympic gold medal. I could hardly take it all in. At one point in the proceedings a brief and casual thought popped into my head: this is all a construct, purpose-built for effect. The Olympic prize-giving is a piece of televised theatre. Despite an absolute belief that we could win, our plans and visualisations never extended beyond the finish line. In some ways being awarded the gold medal felt as surreal as if I found myself sitting beside Goldilocks eating porridge with the three bears.</p> <p>We dived headfirst into a whirlwind of parties. The city was alive with carnival-like celebrations. Unfortunately my energy levels waned with alarming speed. After a week I began to crave some normality. I ended the party-marathon the morning after the closing ceremony with several sleepless, singing Brits: there were four gold medallists across two different sports, shooting vodka from a paper cup at 7am in the Olympic food hall. This was not normal.</p> <p>By the time I boarded the flight home I felt as if I were nearing the end of an endurance event or some kind of sleep deprivation experiment. I was fast approaching breaking point where the next selfie, photo-op, or glass of champagne might be terminal. Apologies to the lovely BA staff who kindly served me a glass of champagne \u2013 I just couldn\u2019t face it. After no teammates accepted the offer I had to surreptitiously pour it down the sink at 30,000ft. For the first few hours of the flight I rapidly flitted in and out of strange dreams. I kept lurching back into consciousness, puncturing the snatched and restless sleep. In the end I opted for a Baileys. It did the trick. I was asleep in no time.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/23/team-gb-return-rio-olympics-victorious-heathrow-champagn-honours\">Team GB return from Rio Olympics on gold-nosed 747</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The next thing I knew, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/23/team-gb-return-rio-olympics-victorious-heathrow-champagn-honours\" title=\"\">I stood bleary-eyed, in front of the world\u2019s media</a>. I felt decidedly the worse for wear and no doubt I didn\u2019t look particularly fresh. I would like to apologise to all the fans that crowded every section of the airport, from runway to bag carousel to car park. It was incredible to have so much support, and I am deeply sorry for my detached look. I was so desperate to get home that I might have been tempted to trade my newly acquired gold medal to be teleported to my bed.</p> <p>I slept for many hours when I got home. I felt quite rough at first but am starting to feel a bit more human now. I have spent most of the last 10 years preparing for major sports events, so the time following an Olympics can feel a bit empty: I felt a similar void after London. I like to have goals and targets to work towards and if I am not being productive then I can get frustrated, so losing the focus of winning the Olympics is a giant gap to fill. However, I enjoy visiting schools and other organisations to help inspire other people and share the positive values of sport.</p> <p>From within my chaotic and surreal memories of Rio grows a quiet satisfaction of a job well done; the pleasing knowledge that our crew executed the race in a manner we knew we were capable of, and that it was good enough to win the Olympic gold.</p>",

  "<p>An article has surfaced from the quagmire of bilge that is The Internet and it has caused, not without reason, a small tornado of outrage. Written as dating advice for \u201cThe Modern Man\u201d (a misnomer if ever there were one), it promises a solution to the hot \u2018n\u2019 horny down-on-their-luck young bucks of the world who face the tedious obstacle of a woman wearing headphones, because how dare she. And no, it isn\u2019t a parody.</p> <p>You can read it in its <a href=\"http://www.themodernman.com/dating/how-to-talk-to-a-woman-who-is-wearing-headphones.html\">full entitled glory</a>, or stick with me as I dissect each grubby, jaw-dropping delusion of psychopathic awfulness. It\u2019s going to be quite a ride.<br></p> <blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.themodernman.com/dating/how-to-talk-to-a-woman-who-is-wearing-headphones.html\"><strong>How to Talk to a Woman Who is Wearing Headphones</strong></a></p> <p>\u201cThese days, many women walk around playing with a smartphone or tablet device and are often wearing headphones and listening to music at the same time.</p> <p>Yet, that doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t talk to them.</p> <p>Of course, not all women are open to being approached because not all women are single and looking.</p> <p>However, if a woman wearing headphones is single and hoping to meet a boyfriend (or even a new lover), she will almost always be happy to take off her headphones to give you an opportunity to create a spark with her.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>The author, one Dan Bacon, could have saved us all a lot of bother here by answering his \u201cHow to\u201d with \u201cDon\u2019t\u201d. Sadly he seems to have missed some basic behavioural science here; you see, the very reason I and many other women wear headphones isn\u2019t as a trivial obstacle to some throbbing hormone mountain, nor as a challenge for those blessed with an abundance of ego. It\u2019s a defence. A defence <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/3542391.stm\">against the aural onslaught of modern life </a>and especially the leering advances of said throbbing hormone mountains. In short, we wear them because we don\u2019t want to be talked to. It\u2019s basic physics really - <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://physicsbuzz.physicscentral.com/2011/12/physics-of-noise-cancelling-headphones.html\">we fill our ear holes to stop you from getting in</a>.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>But back to Dan:</p> <blockquote> <p><strong>What to Do to Get Her Attention</strong></p> <p>1. Stand in front of her (with 1 to 1.5 meters between you).</p> <p>2. Have a relaxed, easy-going smile.<br></p> <p>3. Is she hasn\u2019t already looked up at you, simply get her attention with a wave of your hand. Wave your hand in her direct line of vision so she can\u2019t ignore it.<br></p> <p>4. When she looks at you, smile and point to her headphones and say, \u201cTake off your headphones for a minute\u201d and pretend to be taking headphones off your head, so she fully understands.<br></p> <p>If she doesn\u2019t understand (most women will), simply gesture that you want to talk to her by briefly pointing back and forth from you to her and say, \u201cI want to talk to you for a minute.\u201d<br></p> <p>In most cases, you won\u2019t have to go to that extreme, but some girls are shy and will be hesitant to take the headphones off right away because they are feeling a lot of nervousness and excitement about what is happening.</p> <p>5. Then, do what we call \u201cAcknowledging the Awkwardness\u201d by quickly mentioning something about the awkwardness of the moment (see the conversation example below), to demonstrate you understand that approaching a woman in this way isn\u2019t the most common of experiences for either party.<br></p> <p>This helps put her at ease and know that you are a cool guy who she can relax and open up to.<br></p> </blockquote> <p>I don\u2019t know if these five steps are a common \u201cthing\u201d, but I have personally experienced this several times. At step 1 I know what you are doing and I\u2019m ignoring you, hoping the ground will open up and take one of us to the depths of somewhere Hellish, which would be more pleasant than this situation is developing to be. By step 3 I\u2019m not feeling \u201cexcited\u201d and I\u2019m not feeling \u201cflattered\u201d as Dan later tells his readers I will be - I\u2019m feeling harassed. Straight up, <a href=\"http://physicsbuzz.physicscentral.com/2011/12/physics-of-noise-cancelling-headphones.html\">dictionary definition harassed</a>.<br></p> <p>By step 4 I\u2019ve learnt that <a href=\"http://www.study-body-language.com/Defensive-body-language.html\">you can\u2019t understand a basic body language brush-off</a> and are therefore a direct threat to my personal safety. My brain is in fight or flight, checking for escape routes, it\u2019s trying to figure out just how aggressively you\u2019re going to react to any further action I take to extract myself from a situation entirely not of my own making and it is praying they use a flattering photo of me on the news, not that one when my front-facing camera went off accidentally that time.<br></p> <p>According to step 5, the fact you have bullied me into one of the most awkward and scary moments of my life makes you a \u201ccool guy\u201d. Mr Bacon clearly has trouble spelling. It begins with a \u2018t\u2019, Dan.<br></p> <p>Here\u2019s Dan\u2019s interpretation of how the conversation goes once a man has used his infallible five-point Jedi mind trick to bludgeon a woman from her blissful state of aural security:<br></p> <blockquote> <p><strong>You:</strong> [Smile in a friendly, confident manner] Hey \u2013 I know it\u2019s not normal for people to talk to someone with headphones in, but I was walking along and saw you and thought \u2013 wow, she\u2019s a cutie, I have to say hi. I\u2019m Dan, what\u2019s your name?</p> <p><strong>Woman:</strong> [Usually flattered by the compliment and impressed by your confidence to approach her like that] Jessica.</p> <p><strong>You:</strong> [Add in some humor] Cool\u2026nice to meet you Jessica. I don\u2019t normally talk to girls with headphones, but your big green headphones were just calling out to me.</p> <p><strong>Woman:</strong> [Most likely laughing, smiling and enjoying the interaction].</p> <p><strong>You:</strong> [Let her know that you have something to do/somewhere to go, so she understands that you\u2019re not going to stand there talking to her for 30 minutes] Anyway, so I\u2019m just out doing a bit of shopping at the moment. I\u2019m on my way to a store up the street. How\u2019s your day going so far?</p> </blockquote> <p>In his scenario, Jessica has just been waiting her whole life to be blessed with the attention of a complete stranger who mistakes hunched shoulders, darting eyes and rictus for laughing and smiling.</p> <p>Here\u2019s how it plays out in real life. Trust me, I\u2019ve been it, seen it and spoken to the survivors:<br></p> <blockquote> <p><strong>Him:</strong> I see you don\u2019t want to be talked to but I find you physically attractive and I\u2019m making that your problem.</p> <p><strong>Her</strong><strong>: </strong>Please leave me alone.</p> <p><strong>Him:</strong> F*** YOU, YOU STUCK UP B****, I DIDN\u2019T FANCY YOU ANYWAY.</p> </blockquote> <p>With \u201cadvice\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/brain-flapping/2013/sep/18/how-to-pick-up-women-with-science\">like this out there</a>, it\u2019s hardly any surprise, is it? These lonely men so desperately in search of conquests have been given permission, blessed with the entitlement to go forth and pluck their bounty using but five humble steps. So imagine their horror and indignation when that which has been promised doesn\u2019t want to be plucked and tells them to sling their greasy hook.<br></p> <p>Next Dan lists the five mistakes men make when approaching a woman who is wearing headphones. Sadly not one of them is to sod right off.<br></p> <p>Points 1, 4 and 5 are fairly inoffensive, generic dating guff (be confident, be engaging, be flirty), but oh boy, just try and get your noggin round points 2 and 3.</p> <p><strong>2. Allowing her to ignore him</strong><br></p> <blockquote> <p>\u201cHeadphones are a great barrier between a person and the rest of the world.</p> <p>That being said, if a guy wants to get a woman\u2019s attention he needs to show confidence by being determined to get her to stop listening to the music and chat to him to him.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>If a guy has a weak vibe or presence about him, a woman usually won\u2019t give in to his request for her to remove the headphones.</p> <p>Women love to test guys to see how confident they really are and a favorite test of women is to ignore a guy\u2019s attempts to converse with her and see what he will do next. Will he walk away in shame, or will he remain calm and continue talking to her in a confident, easy-going manner?</p> <p>This is her way of gauging his interest in her and also a way of determining whether he is mentally and emotionally strong enough for a girl like her.</p> <p>If a guy gives up at the first sign of resistance, most women will be turned off by his mental and emotional weakness as a man.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>3. Allowing her to take control of the interaction</strong></p> <blockquote> <p>\u201cNo matter how confident or challenging a woman might behave, she still dreams of meeting a guy who is more confident than her. A woman doesn\u2019t want to be forced to control an interaction with a guy (i.e. call the shots, boss him around), but she will if she has to.</p> <p>Controlling an interaction with a woman is not about bossing her around, being arrogant or being too assertive. Instead, you simply need to assume the role of the man and let her be the woman. In other words, make her feel girly around you because you think, behave and feel (your vibe) so masculine.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>The advice here is basically \u201cNo doesn\u2019t mean no, it means keep going until you get what you want - the screaming will stop eventually\u201d. Because apparently that\u2019s what women want - and forms the basis for a million rape defence cases. Trust me, when we tell you to go away we aren\u2019t testing your measure as a man, we\u2019re testing how quickly your legs can carry you in an offward direction.<br></p> <p>Put Dan\u2019s advice into any other scenario for the true jaw-drop factor: \u201cShopkeepers may lock their doors at night, but if you want a pint of milk, just hammer on the door until they open up. They\u2019ll be flattered.\u201d<br></p> <p>I appreciate the world of mating is hard but please, for the love of humanity, learn this: just because you want, doesn\u2019t mean you can have. Women are not commodities to be hunted and won, and if you have no luck finding someone to bump pink bits with, that\u2019s your problem, not our fault for not adhering to the playbook rules. It\u2019s a playbook we never signed up for and it\u2019s only a game if both teams actually know they\u2019re playing.<br></p> <p>Nowhere in his advice does Dan tell his frustrated man-babies how to handle rejection with grace, because the advice is simply not to accept it. This attitude is why I and countless other women have been been chased down the street, followed home, physically restrained, spat at, verbally abused and generally made to feel like garbage, merely for trying to exist.<br></p> <p>So when, I hear the whiny pissbabies ask, when am I allowed to approach hot single women? Simple.<br></p> <p>If a woman has her headphones in, the answer is never - and before you bleat on about \u201cooh, what if there\u2019s a fire?\u201d, she\u2019ll smell it, even through all your bulls**t. If you\u2019re in a bar or party, her flirtatious smile may be the come-on you\u2019re looking for, but be prepared to accept that you read it wrong, politely wish her a good evening and toddle back off out of her life without 20 minutes of awkward pawing, insisting she let you buy her a rohypnoltini. But how about this; take up a hobby, ask your friends if they know of someone looking to date or (brace yourself for a whopper of a revelation) if you\u2019re looking for a horde of single, eligible women all looking for friendship-maybe-more in one convenient place, try a dating site.</p> <p>Anyway, coming soon from Dan Bacon, \u2018How To Talk To A Woman Through A Fog Of Pepper Spray\u2019.

  "<p>When Brandon Black and his wife were trying to fix up the old two-unit house they\u2019d recently bought in Cincinnati, they discovered they needed some help from people who actually knew what they were doing. His old wrestling coach and her father \u2013 two baby boomers with construction experience \u2013 proved to be invaluable home improvement mentors, who happily guided them through the process.</p> <p>Black realised that the project was mutually beneficial: he and his wife needed help, and his coach and father-in-law had skills they wanted to share. He also realised there were probably many other people in Cincinnati \u2013 both new homeowners and older skilled tradespeople \u2013 in the same situation.</p> <p>\u201cWhat if there was a way a new homeowner could just borrow somebody\u2019s aunt or uncle and leverage their experience?\u201d Black says.</p> <p>He saw an opportunity to connect these two groups.

  "<p>As you move into the private rented sector for the first time, there are many things to get your head around to ensure you\u2019re in a safe, secure tenancy.</p> <p>Whether you\u2019ve chosen to live with your mates, strangers or on your own, it can feel daunting to take on the responsibility of renting \u2013 especially when you don\u2019t know what your rights are.</p> <p>But fear not. The National Union of Students (NUS) has launched a <a href=\"http://readytorent.nus.org.uk/\">new website</a> full of resources, advice and information to help students understand their rights and the policies that affect them.</p> <p>Here are 10 things to consider when moving into your new accommodation:</p> <h2>1) What\u2019s in the contract?</h2> <p>Tenancy contracts tend to be long, confusing and full of legal jargon. It\u2019s tempting to just skip to the end and sign it, especially if you\u2019re in a hurry to move. However, your contract is a legally binding document and it\u2019s where you can mandate your landlord (who should be named in the contract) to do certain things \u2013 like fix broken appliances \u2013 and vice versa. Make time to have your contract read over by someone who knows their stuff; this can be invaluable in making sure there are no loopholes. Your university, college or students\u2019 union may offer this as a service. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqBJEQ0k4hE\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/zqBJEQ0k4hE?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <h2>2) What\u2019s the state of your new home?</h2> <p>When you first move in, your landlord should provide you with a detailed inventory of the property. This should cover each room and all of the furniture and fittings, stating what condition they are in. If you didn\u2019t get one, do your own and send it to the agent or landlord. If you get an inventory but you aren\u2019t happy with it, challenge it straight away and include evidence of your claims: always take photographs and send a copy to the agent or landlord (make sure you keep a copy too). </p> <h2>3) Where is your deposit going?</h2> <p>Before you move in, you\u2019ll be required to pay a security deposit. This is usually six weeks\u2019 rent, withheld until the end of your contract in case there are any overdue payments or damage to the property. Make sure your estate agent or landlord has put your deposit in a protected scheme and shown you evidence \u2013 this is a legal requirement. If your landlord has deducted excessively high charges at the end of your tenancy, you also have the right to challenge them.</p> <h2>4) How much are you paying in fees?</h2> <p>The law on letting agents\u2019 fees differs across the UK. In England and Wales, they must tell you about the fees they charge upfront on their website and in their offices, but in Northern Ireland this is not required \u2013 although you can always ask. Fees can differ hugely, so you may want to factor in these costs when choosing which agent to go with. In Scotland, it is against the law for agents to charge fees. </p> <h2>5) Have you insured your valuables? </h2> <p>It\u2019s worth protecting yourself in case the worst happens, so invest in content insurance for your room and ensure that your phone, laptop, camera and other pieces of expensive equipment are covered. It is very rare that landlords will offer an insurance scheme.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/jun/21/homeless-students-nowhere-sleep-london-emergency-accommodation\">Hidden homeless: the students ashamed to admit they\u2019ve nowhere to sleep</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>6) Is your landlord accredited? </h2> <p>There are landlords who have multiple properties specifically to let to students \u2013 but some of them are known for ripping them off. Many local authorities and students\u2019 unions run best practice schemes that include landlords who have signed up to a code of conduct, so check online. Your students\u2019 union may also operate its own not-for-profit lettings agent, which only uses vetted landlords.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXqRwZMxu4k\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/YXqRwZMxu4k?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <h2>7) Will you be disturbed?</h2> <p>Your landlord must give you at least 24 hours\u2019 notice before they access the property, and you have no obligation to let them in if they haven\u2019t given you proper notice.</p> <h2>8) Have you seen the Energy Performance Certificate?</h2> <p>This should have been shown to you before you signed your tenancy agreement, to give you an indication of how energy efficient your home is. This can have a big impact on the cost of your energy bills.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2015/sep/16/eight-golden-rules-for-living-in-student-halls\">Eight golden rules for living in student halls</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>9) Do you know the rules on eviction?</h2> <p>Once you have signed your tenancy agreement, the landlord cannot evict you without going to court and following a clear set of procedures. Similarly, your landlord cannot raise your rent if you have signed a fixed-term contract that states a set amount for set period.</p> <h2>10) Have you joined a tenants\u2019 union or activist network?</h2> <p>Local areas often have organised groups of private tenants who work together to campaign on issues, offer advice and support, and act as a representative body. Find out if there is a tenants\u2019 union, association or similar group and join it. The larger your network, the savvier you are and the more likely you can work with others to resist \u2013 from rent hikes to local bin collections. <a href=\"http://www.generationrent.org/\">Generation Rent</a> has a list of some groups.</p> <p>You can find more advice on the <a href=\"http://readytorent.nus.org.uk/\">Ready to Rent website</a>.</p> <p><strong>Keep up with the latest on Guardian Students: follow us on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gdnstudents\">@GdnStudents</a> \u2013 and <a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/students/\">become a member</a> to receive exclusive benefits and our weekly newsletter.</strong></p>",
  "<p>Three boys chase each other and a small dog around a tree at the<a href=\"http://www.echa-in.org/west_calumet.htm\"> West Calumet public housing</a> project in East Chicago, Indiana, under the watchful eyes of 80-year-old Mary Fluellen .</p> <p>\u201cWash your hands when you get inside!\u201d says Fluellen, better known as \u201cGranny\u201d around the complex. </p> <p>Over the past few weeks residents have <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/in/west-calumet-housing-complex-east-chicago-ind\">received notices</a> telling them to wash their hands thoroughly and leave their shoes at the door, to avoid spreading lead that has been found in dangerously high levels in soil at the housing project.</p> <p>But such precautionary measures seem futile after years of families living amid the contamination.</p> <p>\u201cWe used to have mud fights and play slip-and-slide\u201d on the wet grass, remembers Anthony Abbey, 33, who grew up in the housing complex. </p> <p>\u201cYou were throwing lead at each other,\u201d notes Mario Irving.</p> <p>The community of about 1,100 mostly African American residents of the housing project has been reeling since receiving word in the past month that they have to relocate. The tidy two-storey brick units where many have lived for decades will be torn down because of massive levels of lead and arsenic contamination in the soil, deceptively masked by lush green grass and clumps of flowers.</p> <p>There have been concerns about lead contamination for decades, and tests by the US Environmental Protection Agency a decade ago found hot spots of serious contamination. But federal and state officials had concluded residents were not at risk until the May release of comprehensive soil test results, which showed more than half the project\u2019s yards exceeded lead levels that would trigger emergency cleanup, and many also had high levels of arsenic.</p> <p>Many residents say they were unaware of the situation until they received letters in July from the city\u2019s mayor, Anthony Copeland, noting the findings and stating: \u201cWe feel it is in your best interest to temporarily relocate your household.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9d95a7275caf8c72942ca9145c5a11ce204ce745\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9d95a7275caf8c72942ca9145c5a11ce204ce745/0_173_2592_1555/1000.jpg\" alt=\"indiana lead\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The lush green grass surrounding the West Calumet housing complex masks the dangerous soil contamination underneath.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kari Lydersen</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Since then, local children and adults have been getting blood tests. Many have come back showing serious levels of lead; others are awaiting their results, and still others have gotten results that are considered safe. But people who have lost all trust in official sources don\u2019t believe them.</p> <p>Parents and grandparents say they are torn between competing impulses: anxious to move out of an environment that may be causing children irreversible harm, but wary of shattering a community home to many extended families and lifelong friends.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s very tight-knit,\u201d said Milton Ross, a wiry 62-year-old construction worker who lives with his mother in the complex. \u201cWhen I first heard, my heart told Jesus: \u2018Wherever we all go, I hope there are a lot of events where we can come back and get together.\u2019\u201d</p> <h2>A crisis 30 years in the making</h2> <p>There have been concerns about lead contamination in the soil here since at least 1985, when a nearby lead smelter shut down. In soil tests released in 2006, the EPA found seriously elevated lead levels in some areas. Those spots were cleaned up, and in 2009 the site was added to the Superfund National Priorities List. The federal government oversaw blood tests of local children. But in 2011 a branch of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released<a href=\"https://semspub.epa.gov/work/05/424321.pdf\"> a report</a> saying that declining numbers of children with elevated blood lead levels led them to conclude the contamination did not pose a public health threat.</p> <p>The EPA cited this finding as the reason it did not more aggressively continue to test the soil, at least not until it had to develop a cleanup plan under <a href=\"https://cumulis.epa.gov/supercpad/cursites/csitinfo.cfm?id=0501433\">an agreement </a>with the companies responsible for polluting the area, the DuPont chemical company and Atlantic Richfield Company.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/in/west-calumet-housing-complex-east-chicago-ind\">The results</a> released in May showed soil in the majority of yards above the EPA\u2019s 1,200 parts per million standard for emergency cleanup. </p> <p>The EPA maintains it could remediate the soil in yards and residents could continue living there. But city officials said they think the lead stirred up during remediation would be a risk to residents. And since the city had already decided the complex would be demolished in coming years, officials decided it wouldn\u2019t make sense to remediate it.</p> <p>Now residents are getting Housing Choice Vouchers that subsidize rental units. But there are ceilings on how much rent the voucher will cover, and many prospective renters struggle to find landlords who will accept the vouchers.</p> <p>City attorney Carla Morgan said that officials are scrambling to find new homes for the 357 families who live in the West Calumet project.</p> <p>While the West Calumet housing complex will be evacuated and torn down, the EPA is testing soil across the rest of the<a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/superfund/ussmelter-lead-refinery\"> USS Lead Superfund site</a>, filled with single-family homes, small businesses, multiple churches and a relatively new but now vacant elementary school. The agency has estimated 723 of 1,271 parcels in the area will need to be cleaned up.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m praying,\u201d said Jennifer Sims, 57, who lives in her childhood home a few blocks from the housing project. Sims grew up playing in the housing project, and remembers that \u201cmothers and families lived on the gardens\u201d growing vegetables in the tainted soil. \u201cWhy did they do this to us?\u201d</p> <p>The impacts of longstanding lead contamination in West Calumet could also stretch to surrounding areas, where many people who grew up there have dispersed.</p> <p>Tyra Taylor, 45, raised her three kids in West Calumet. Her daughter, now 25, has epilepsy and cervical cancer, she said. And Taylor suffers from a long list of health problems including neuropathy, glaucoma and a disorder which causes her to faint frequently. Now living in a rental unit a block away, she thinks the lead and arsenic contamination explain a lot about the family\u2019s health.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s the lead!\u201d she says, throwing her arms wide.</p> <p>Like many residents, she is angry that the housing authority and EPA continued to allow residents to live in the project after contamination was suspected and then confirmed.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ee15c178162ca5398bf82229daadeb4b47c7c16c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ee15c178162ca5398bf82229daadeb4b47c7c16c/0_49_2592_1555/1000.jpg\" alt=\"West Calumet residents in East Chicago, Indiana.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tyra Taylor, her son, and friend Anthony Abbey in East Chicago near her home and the West Calumet housing project.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kari Lydersen/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Residents said they never would have moved here if they knew about the contamination, but they said they were left in the dark until just recently.</p> <p>Robert Kaplan, the EPA Region 5 acting administrator, noted that over the years there have been multiple public comment periods, meetings hosted in local libraries and postcards sent out about the soil testing and cleanup plans.</p> <p>\u201cI understand that there are newer residents and people moving in and out, so outreach can be difficult,\u201d Kaplan said, but \u201cunder the usual Superfund process, everything is public notice ... We received no public comment including from the city.\u201d</p> <p>Many residents attribute the situation to racism; national pundits have compared it to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/flint-water-crisis\">debacle in Flint, Michigan</a>, where officials let residents drink contaminated water for months.</p> <p>\u201cThey think because we stay over here we\u2019re nothing, we\u2019re lowlifes, we\u2019re black and we\u2019re poor, they treat us like dogs,\u201d said Irving, who is a single father and a student at Ivy Tech community college. \u201cThey\u2019re killing us softly.\u201d</p> <p>Morgan said the current mayoral administration cannot be accused of environmental injustice since Copeland has been proactive on the issue, and since city officials are largely African American and from similar socioeconomic backgrounds to the affected residents. </p> <p>The EPA said of residents\u2019 feelings of injustice: \u201cProtecting public health, especially in environmental justice communities is a top priority for EPA. That\u2019s why the Agency has taken many steps over the past several years to keep the residents of the West Calumet Housing Project informed about the work being done in their area to reduce lead exposure.\u201d</p> <p>Meanwhile Taylor prefers to temper her anger with laughter.</p> <p>\u201cIf you scratch our arms along a piece of paper, you can write, like a pencil,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s the lead!\u201d </p>",

The <a href=\"http://www.autism.org.uk/\">National Autistic Society</a> (NAS) is calling for doctors to have a better understanding of how gender differences affect autism, and to recognise that women and girls have been historically under-diagnosed.</p> <p>In its <a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjck4PtiunOAhUoKcAKHVLHDZkQFggeMAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.autism.org.uk%2F~%2Fmedia%2F20F5BD5ADBDE42479F126C3E550CE5B0.ashx&amp;usg=AFQjCNGapc_ZBLyFB8PyVT_M5jIVVrwnug&amp;sig2=am0RS9iA6nhGJ4ZXgw4pwQ&amp;cad=rja\">2012 survey</a> of more than 8,000 autistic people and family members in the UK, the NAS found that women and girls were more likely to be misdiagnosed than men and boys (41% of females had been diagnosed with another condition on assessment, compared to 30% of males). And once they were diagnosed, women and girls were less likely to access extra support. In cases of Asperger syndrome, only 8% of girls were diagnosed before they had reached the age of six, compared to 25% of boys; and only 20% of girls were diagnosed by the age of 11, compared to 50% of boys. Many women remain undiagnosed until their 20s or 30s.</p> <p>From an early age, I was fascinated with the way things worked and happiest reading books and being on my own. Playing with groups of other children was always disastrous. I also had sensory problems and an over-sensitivity. Labels in clothes, unexpected noises, strong smells and dirt and germs would stop me in my tracks.</p> <p>When we were considering our O-level choices, my biology teacher suggested I pursue a career in medicine, but all I could focus on as she spoke was the smell of the lab and the alarming appearance of the locusts in formaldehyde. I couldn\u2019t bear it, so I chose drama school instead. I\u2019d spent my life training to be other people, watching and learning, surmising how to fit in, so I loved this experience.</p> <p>I needed other people to explain to me the mysteries of human behaviour. My brother Michael, who died when I was 12, was one of these people; my mother, my rock, was another. As an adult, when both my daughters were diagnosed as autistic, I wondered if my eccentricities were similar to theirs, but life was so busy caring for them and my mother, who had Alzheimer\u2019s, that there was no time to question it.</p> <p>Last year though, when a counsellor raised the question again, I decided to pursue diagnosis. My GP referred me to a diagnostic team of two psychiatrists for a huge catchment area in Shropshire where there was a long waiting list. Frameworks for diagnosing autism vary and in my case concentrated on my childhood; I found it really difficult emotionally to talk about myself, and my husband accompanied me to the sessions over a period of months.</p> <p>When the diagnosis came I cried with relief. I\u2019d felt it was almost a battle, that I\u2019d had to prove myself, that I wasn\u2019t mad.</p> <p>I realise now that I\u2019d always known that I was autistic \u2013 as had my husband, and my oldest daughter Lizzy. I think my Mum suspected it too, especially after the girls were diagnosed. To anyone in my situation, if you want a diagnosis ask your GP whether you can be assessed. But know that, as a woman, you might be misdiagnosed at first because you\u2019ve probably become adept at covering up traits and behaviour that others have told you is unacceptable. Women are generally raised and expected to be compliant, so diagnostic markers of autism are often self-suppressed and internalised.</p> <p>It\u2019s well documented that eating disorders and very high levels of anxiety are common for women and girls with autism. Food has been a friend and feared enemy for most of my life, and my anxiety stems in part from attempting to identify and comply with social rules. I find it impossible to be quiet, for example, if I believe someone in authority is wrong. I also have a tendency either to overshare, or to stay silent when I should speak up in my own defence. Mostly I identify social rules only once I\u2019ve broken them. I\u2019ve often crossed the invisible line of social conformity and faced retribution. I\u2019ve been ostracised at work and online, because I say what I think, which is not always well received.</p> <p>No two autistic people are the same. Some people with autistic spectrum disorder (ASD) are outgoing and gregarious, some shy and selectively mute. What unites everyone on the spectrum is that our needs, wants and desires are as essential as anyone else\u2019s. An assumption that because we can\u2019t necessarily express those needs in a way non-autistic people find palatable and understandable, doesn\u2019t mean we don\u2019t need to be understood.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/apr/23/autism-tv-the-a-word-cant-accept-real-life\">We have put autism on TV but can\u2019t accept it in real life | John Harris</a> </p> </aside>  <p>For me the diagnosis was liberation from a life of censure, which targeted aspects of my personality over which I have no control. I was often told that my thoughts and feelings were stupid, that I was odd or weird or my emotions were inappropriate. The people who loved me, loved my passion; those who didn\u2019t called me aggressive. That taught me to be quiet and to try to suppress what I thought. I felt relief on being diagnosed and when I discussed it online I received such supportive responses from others diagnosed later in life too that for the first time I felt I belonged.</p> <p>I\u2019ve been a disability rights campaigner online for eight years, so the decision to reveal my diagnosis was straightforward for me, but the stigma of autism and all invisible conditions was clear in the reaction, with many saying that it was brave to reveal this. It seemed no braver to me than saying I have blue eyes. So on Twitter I started the hashtag <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23SheCantBeAutistic&amp;src=typd\">#SheCantBeAutistic</a> to gather some of the dismissive responses women have received from clinicians, friends and family. Women talked about being told that they or their daughter couldn\u2019t possibly be autistic, because they were able to make eye contact, had good verbal skills, showed empathy and weren\u2019t violent. This shows the misunderstanding of autism in women, but of the condition in general too.</p> <p>The pioneering work of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/jun/22/lorna-wing\">Lorna Wing</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2009/apr/12/autism-aspergers-girls\">Judith Gould</a> has shown that autism is a spectrum. It has no bias in terms of age, status, wealth, location, race, ethnicity or gender. But achievement and life choices do seem to colour the view of some clinicians who have to diagnose this condition.</p> <p>If a woman has had children, is in a relationship, is interested in makeup, music, fashion, or in my case doing stand-up comedy, this level of sophistication apparently makes diagnosis \u201cless clearcut\u201d. At worst, it apparently makes autism seem \u201cnonexistent\u201d.</p> <p>Women are still expected to behave as others dictate, from the function of our uterus, to the way we express ourselves in person or on the page. For women with autism our capacity and interest in conformity is diminished \u2013 we are no friend to the patriarchy. The status quo is that autism is seen as a predominantly male condition. Wider recognition of autistic women must start now.</p>",
  "<p>When we look at the rise of artificial intelligence, it\u2019s easy to get carried away with dystopian visions of sentient machines that rebel against their human creators. Fictional baddies such as the Terminator\u2019s Skynet or Hal from 2001: A Space Odyssey <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/apr/12/brave-new-world-sci-fi-fears-hold-back-progress-of-ai-warns-expert\">have a lot to answer for</a>.</p> <p>However, the real risk posed by AI \u2013 at least in the near term \u2013 is much more insidious. It\u2019s far more likely that robots would inadvertently harm or frustrate humans while carrying out our orders than they would become conscious and rise up against us. In recognition of this, the University of California, Berkeley has this week launched a center to focus on building people-pleasing AIs.</p> <p>The Center for Human-Compatible Artificial Intelligence, launched this week with $5.5m in funding from the Open Philanthropy Project, is led by computer science professor and artificial intelligence pioneer <a href=\"https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~russell/\">Stuart Russell</a>. He\u2019s quick to dispel any \u201cunreasonable and melodramatic\u201d comparisons to the threats posed in science fiction.</p> <p>\u201cThe risk doesn\u2019t come from machines suddenly developing spontaneous malevolent consciousness,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s important that we\u2019re not trying to prevent that from happening because there\u2019s absolutely no understanding of consciousness whatsoever.\u201d</p> <p>Russell is well known in the artificial intelligence community and in 2015 penned an open letter calling for researchers to look beyond the goal of simply making AI more capable and powerful to think about maximizing its social benefit. <a href=\"http://futureoflife.org/ai-open-letter\">The letter</a> has been signed by more than 8,000 scientists and entrepreneurs including physicist Stephen Hawking, entrepreneur Elon Musk and Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak.</p> <p>\u201cThe potential benefits [of AI research] are huge, since everything that civilization has to offer is a product of human intelligence; we cannot predict what we might achieve when this intelligence is magnified by the tools AI may provide, but the eradication of disease and poverty are not unfathomable,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jan/12/elon-musk-ai-artificial-intelligence-pitfalls\">the letter reads</a>.</p> <p>\u201cBecause of the great potential of AI, it is important to research how to reap its benefits while avoiding potential pitfalls.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s precisely this thinking that underpins the new center.</p> <p>Up until now, AI has primarily been applied to very limited contexts such as playing Chess or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/mar/12/alphago-beats-lee-sedol-in-third-consecutive-go-game\">Go</a> or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2015/may/13/baidu-minwa-supercomputer-better-than-humans-recognising-images\">recognizing objects in images</a>, where there isn\u2019t much scope for the system to do much damage. As they start to make decisions on our behalf within the real world, the stakes are much higher.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/aug/27/technology-myth-of-human-centrality\">Technology is killing the myth of human centrality \u2013 let's embrace our demotion</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cAs soon as you put things in the real world, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jul/01/tesla-driver-killed-autopilot-self-driving-car-harry-potter\">self-driving cars</a>, digital assistants \u2026 as soon as they buy things on your behalf, turn down appointments, then they have to align with human values,\u201d Russell said. </p> <p>He uses autonomous vehicles to illustrate the type of problem the center will try to solve. Someone building a self-driving car might instruct it never to go through a red light, but the machine might then hack into the traffic light control system so that all of the lights are changed to green. In this case the car would be obeying orders but in a way that humans didn\u2019t expect or intend. Similarly, an artificially intelligent hedge fund designed to maximize the value of its portfolio could be incentivized to short consumer stocks, buy long on defence stocks and then start a war \u2013 as suggested by Elon Musk in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/aug/16/werner-herzog-lo-and-behold-film-lessons\">Werner Herzog\u2019s latest documentary</a>.</p> <p>\u201cEven when you think you\u2019ve put fences around what an AI system can do it will tend to find loopholes just as we do with our tax laws. You want an AI system that isn\u2019t motivated to find loopholes,\u201d Russell said.</p> <p>\u201cThe problem isn\u2019t consciousness, but competence. You make machines that are incredibly competent at achieving objectives and they will cause accidents in trying to achieve those objectives.\u201d</p> <p>To address this, Russell and his colleagues at the center propose making AI systems that observe human behavior and try to work out what the human\u2019s objective is, then behave accordingly and learn from mistakes. So instead of trying to give the machine a long list of rules to follow, the machine is told that its main objective is to do what the human wants them to do. </p> <p>It sounds simple, but it\u2019s not how engineers have been building systems for the past 50 years.</p> <p>But if AI systems can be designed to learn from humans in this way, it should ensure that they remain under human control even when they develop capabilities that exceed our own.</p> <p>In addition to watching humans directly using cameras and other sensors, robots can learn about us by reading history books, legal documents, novels, newspaper stories as well as by watching videos and movies. From this they can start to build up an understanding of human values.</p> <p>It won\u2019t be easy for machines. \u201cPeople are irrational, inconsistent, weak-willed, computationally limited, heterogenous and sometimes downright evil,\u201d Russell said.</p> <p>\u201cSome are vegetarians and some really like a nice juicy steak. And the fact that we don\u2019t behave anything close to perfectly is a serious difficulty.\u201d</p>",

Since 2001, the cruel trajectory of what was done to the Tampa refugees and others who followed in the so-called Pacific Solution has trashed Australia\u2019s reputation for decency and fairness. Outsourcing the care and protection of vulnerable men, women and children who legally crossed Australia\u2019s borders to claim protection, and outsourcing it to the mendicant, failing neighbouring states of Nauru and Papua New Guinea, was never going to comply with Australia\u2019s obligations under international law.</p> <p>Volunteers like me have supported refugees who set foot on Australian soil after years of suffering on Nauru, and accompanied them in their life in limbo on a temporary visa before family reunion and permanent settlement happened.</p> <p>Charities, community groups and individuals struggle to counter the debilitating despair among the \u201cboat people\u201d, and flail at the politicians and Rupert Murdoch\u2019s media for perpetuating the untruths and myths about asylum seekers, who are not to be confused with illegal immigrants threatening our borders.</p> <p>A majority of Australians have a poor comprehension of refugee persecution. Nor do they understand refugee law \u2013 the human right to seek protection from persecution.<br><strong>Frederika E Steen </strong><br>Chapel Hill, Queensland, Australia</p> <p>\u2022 Regarding your cover story about the appalling level of abuse at the Nauru detention centre: a humane government would surely send an independent task force immediately. It would oversee the care of asylum seekers, and establish new processes and practices to ensure the abuse will cease until an internationally acceptable alternative to offshore detention is agreed. Bickering about setting up a ponderous inquiry is unacceptable. Asylum seekers can\u2019t&#xa0;wait.<br><strong>Hannah Morrow</strong><br>Cambridge, UK</p> <p>\u2022 Australia\u2019s offshore refugee gulags, with their potent appeal to xenophobic populism, but minus the public backlash, are exactly what the politicians intended.</p> <p>Despite their reverence for fiscal rectitude, our leaders are untroubled by the huge cost of imprisoning fewer than 1,800 innocent detainees. They also seem determined to defy the UN Refugee Convention. In this they are blessed by Australia\u2019s luck in being a democracy unfettered by either a bill or charter of rights. In the right\u2019s hands, this is priceless.<br><strong>John Hayward</strong><br>Weegena, Tasmania, Australia</p> <p>\u2022 Are Indigenous Australians wishing they had been able to take all arrivals from Britain and expel them to Nauru?

The desire for publicity ranks very high in these strategies, and however well-intentioned the decision of Le Monde and other leading French newspapers not to publish photos of those who carry out terrorist attacks may be, the attackers have a much bigger reach through social media than through print.</p> <p>The issue, as Burke sees it, is that those with an interest in these new martyrs do not look for them in the well-established print media, but have ready access to so much social media that the martyrs have also gained considerable promotion through the print media itself.</p> <p>What is needed is a deep study on how democracy in practice, in keeping with its values, can keep a watchful eye on the influence of social media through the \u201cextraordinary freedom and power of the digital revolution\u201d.</p> <p>Burke\u2019s analysis of the situation is a reminder of the reality of the media today, and what needs to be done.

That afternoon, I started to dream about levelling the global playing field and creating a world in which my cousins would have as much opportunity as me.</p> <p>As I grew up, I saw the irony of understanding the danger of extreme income inequality through a visit abroad. While my cousin was struggling to survive, so too were thousands of people who grew up in a 30-mile radius of me. I don\u2019t know if my lack of neighbourly empathy was a wilful ignorance coated in my own narcissism, or if it was something more rudimentary \u2013 I was treated horribly growing up.

The expression \u201cgiving a voice to the voiceless\u201d seemed so trite until I realised I didn\u2019t have a voice growing up. People who looked like me were not on TV or in the media; issues facing my ethnic community were not discussed in any significant way on the national stage; the markers I associated as part of my identity were vilified as evil. The problems I faced were not deemed problems to my nation and so, I found myself gravitating away from my nation entirely. <br></p> <p>Instead, I found it easier to get lost in the problems abroad. In other countries, I was not this or that; I was simply me. I was simply there to help. I was simply appreciated.

The Labour party has a code of conduct on this, and it does have to be dealt with.<br></p> <p>\u201cEveryone should learn that when they put something on Facebook or Twitter or online in an email, that is exactly the same as if you\u2019d put it in the print media in any other way, with exactly the same protective laws of libel or slander.</p> <p>\u201cMany people use instant access to Twitter more or less like they\u2019re continuing a pub conversation, and deeply regret the abuse that they sent to people at that time. Unfortunately, it\u2019s there for eternity, in some way or another, on the internet. And so there does have to be quite strict codes of conduct.<br></p> <p>\u201cThere also has to be an educative process about how people do things.

But they do it on Facebook and they do it on Twitter and they do it online.\u201d</p> <p>Speaking in east London, Corbyn unveiled a series of ideas to \u201cdemocratise the internet\u201d, including an online learning hub; publicly funded software and hardware to help teach <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/programming\">programming</a>; a voluntary \u201cdigital citizen passport\u201d to create a secure portable identity; and more use of technology to debate and devise legislation.</p> <p>Corbyn said the plans would \u201crebuild and transform Britain so that no one and no community is left behind\u201d.</p> <p>In parallel, the Labour leader said new technology could transform the party\u2019s election chances, saying he would use innovations pioneered in his leadership campaign against Owen Smith, such as a digital phone canvassing app which allows volunteers to make calls from anywhere, whenever possible.</p> <p>The phone bank app was devised by a group called <a href=\"http://www.codersforcorbyn.com/\">Coders for Corbyn</a>.

The Vermont senator built a similarly energised support base in challenging for the Democratic presidential nomination.</p> <p>Corbyn said the fact Sanders eventually lost to Hillary Clinton did not mean valuable lessons could not be learned. <br></p> <p> \u201cThe Bernie Sanders campaign was amazing in the number of people who attended rallies, the number of people who were mobilised, and the fact he was totally counterintuitive to the whole norm of US politics, which is to appeal to the base that votes and to appeal to the interests of those voters that actually take part,\u201d he said. </p> <p>\u201cWhat the Bernie Sanders campaign did was to energise a whole lot of people \u2013 in a sense, the way that Barack Obama did in 2008 \u2013 by broadening the electoral base, and involving very large numbers of people, and he did that by a combination of digital technology and public rally appearances all over the country.</p> <p>\u201cNo, he didn\u2019t win the nomination, that we fully understand. But he\u2019s changed the Democratic party a great deal. The presidential platform on which Hillary Clinton is fighting the election is radically different compared to what it would have been had she not faced the challenge of Bernie Sanders.\u201d</p> <p>Corbyn said he had enjoyed \u201clong discussions with many people\u201d in the Sanders campaign, saying it had transformed US politics. \u201cIt is a genie that cannot be put back in the bottle,\u201d he said.</p> <p>With <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/22/corbyn-v-smith-labour-leader-voting-system-democratic-car-crash\">leadership ballot papers</a> due to be sent out in the next few days before voting, which closes on 21 September, both Corbyn and Smith have been touring the country and announcing policy initiatives.<br></p> <p>Corbyn has made announcements on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/aug/25/jeremy-corbyn-arts-pupil-premium-primary-schools-reverse-spending-cuts/\">the arts</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/13/jeremy-corbyn-interview-leadership-plots-nhs-education\">education</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/16/corbyn-to-launch-transport-campaign-with-rail-pledges\">transport</a>.

  "<h2>Apple hit by EU tax ruling</h2> <p>Apple is facing a $14.5bn fine from the European commission over unpaid back taxes, stemming from arrangements it made over nearly 25 years with the Irish government.

Key cabinet figures backed this plan, he said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I have spoken to them and I am certain that these characters \u2013 David Davis, Liam Fox and Boris Johnson, and the prime minister by the way \u2013 are very clear that they need to get on with triggering article 50 as soon as possible ...

While the government \u201cneeds to get on and implement the people\u2019s decision\u201d, he said, he really wouldn\u2019t be in such a hurry.</p> <p>The problem is that article 50 is \u201cvery strongly in favour of those who are staying, not the leaving party\u201d, O\u2019Donnell said. That means it would be madness to trigger it without having a \u201cstrategic plan to say \u2018what kind of UK do we want, what\u2019s our place in the world, what are we trying to achieve in these negotiations?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Whatever kind of Brexit it is, it will undoubtedly prove an \u201cunprecedented challenge\u201d for the government and for the civil service, he said \u2013 and particularly for the prime minister: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>She\u2019s got to corral all these different individuals, come up with precisely what version of Brexit we want, what works best for the British people, and then go about implementing it.</p> </blockquote> <p>With those words ringing in her ears, Theresa May promptly <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/28/theresa-may-brexit-meeting-single-market\">announced a meeting of senior cabinet members</a> at the prime minister\u2019s country residence, Chequers, on Wednesday.

This clarity can only be achieved by excluding a privileged trade agreement with the UK ... The century-old British strategy remains the same, ie to weaken the forces that can make Europe stronger. The UK can achieve this by insisting on a special deal whereby the UK maintains the benefits of the union while not sharing in the costs. Such a deal would signal to other member countries that by exiting, they can continue to enjoy the benefits of the union without the costs. Such a prospect would fatally weaken the European Union.</p> </blockquote> <p>At the <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/brexit/2016/08/top-10-reasons-brexit-isnt-working-according-brexiteers\">New Statesman, Ian Leslie has a light-hearted but actually fairly accurate sounding guide to the top 10 reasons why Brexit isn\u2019t working \u2013 according, of course, to Brexiters</a> (sabotage by Whitehall, remainers talking down the country, untrustworthy experts, EU bureaucrats, etc etc):</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Over the next few years, it is likely that the economy will shrink, the entire government will be consumed by trade negotiations, and EU leaders will use their considerable negotiation advantages to theatrically screw us. As this unpretty story unfolds, those who argued confidently for Brexit, in parliament and in the press, will feel compelled to maintain that they were right, and that if it hadn\u2019t been for some other impossible-to-foresee factor everything would be going splendidly. </p> </blockquote> <h2>Tweet of the week</h2> <p>The obvious silver lining?

  "<p>Reaching the Itombwe forest and the people who live in it isn\u2019t easy. A muddy path from Bukavu, the capital of South Kivu province in the <a href=\"https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/world/congo\">Democratic Republic of the Congo</a> (DRC), traverses this mountainous terrain, crossing areas controlled by a multitude of armed militias. Access is difficult for everybody: the NGOs working in the area, and the merchants and miners hoping to benefit from the coltan, gold and wood found here. In the heart of <a href=\"https://www.forestcarbonpartnership.org/sites/fcp/files/2015/November/DRC%202%20pager%20on%20green%20development.pdf\">the world\u2019s second-largest forest basin</a> (pdf), an incomparable wealth of biodiversity has been preserved: rare trees, tropical birds and some of the last gorillas on the planet.<br></p> <p>But the mountain range is changing rapidly. International demand for the DRC\u2019s natural resources, in addition to the country\u2019s <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.KD.ZG?locations=CD\">gradual economic</a> and <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.TOTL?locations=CD\">rapid population growth</a> \u2013 and consequent appetite for exploitable land \u2013 are taking their toll on the forest. Following the war in neighbouring Rwanda in the 1990s, and successive rebellions against the Congolese government, the forest of the Congo basin now hosts <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/world/2016/aug/14/thirty-six-people-are-killed-in-drc-in-revenge-attack-by-adf-rebels\">rebel groups</a> that hide in the mountains and live off the illegal exploitation and trafficking of natural resources.</p> <p>\u201cThe state is itself a threat to our forests: it makes a complete mess of things by handing out timber licences. It gives them to anyone willing to pay, and we see these people come and cut down our trees with impunity. They cut down our medicinal trees and, with them, the bark and fruits used for our medical treatments. They cut down our caterpillar trees, our oil trees,\u201d says Irangi, who is a member of the Mbuti Pygmies in his 30s. He lives on the edge of the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.wwf-congobasin.org/where_we_work/democratic_republic_of_congo/itombwe.cfm\">Itombwe reserve</a>.</p> <p>He has watched as trees have been chopped down for charcoal to be sent to Bukavu and Rwanda. \u201cThese people come with their weapons and take everything: the trees, the animals,\u201d says Irangi. \u201cThey even kill species whose hunting we forbid, like the pangolin and the gorilla. Because they have weapons, they believe that they\u2019re above our laws.</p> <p>\u201cWe also know that our subsoil is rich. One company has already come to dig for gold. If we don\u2019t protect our forest, more aggressors will come and invade our lands. This is why we have to conserve it.\u201d</p> <p>In 2006, the government created the Itombwe nature reserve, supported by <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://wwf.org/\">WWF</a> and the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.wcs.org/\">Wildlife Conservation Society</a> (WCS).

We were afraid that they would steal all of this from us. So we met and decided: we\u2019re not going to let this happen.\u201d<br></p> <p>In the 1980s, in the neighbouring national park of <a href=\"http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/137\">Kahuzi-Biega</a>, nearly 6,000 Pygmies were <a href=\"http://wrm.org.uy/oldsite/bulletin/43/CongoDR.html\">expelled from their villages</a>, condemned to re-establish themselves outside the forest without government support. Today, these groups live in extremely precarious conditions along the major thoroughfares.

I left for a few years to study in the city, but returned \u2026 This land belongs to us because our entire lives are here: we find our food here, our pharmacy, everything we need. We, the Bambuti [plural of Mbuti], can\u2019t live outside of the forest; our nature is to live here.\u201d</p> <p>Though not protected as indigenous by the state \u2013 which would mean recognising their traditional rights over the land \u2013 there are at least <a href=\"http://www.iwgia.org/images/stories/sections/regions/africa/documents/IW2016/Democratic_Republic_of_Congo_IW2016_web_redu.pdf\">600,000 Mbuti Pygmies in the DRC</a> (pdf), according to government estimates, including about 60,000 in the Itombwe forest. They live a semi-nomadic life.</p> <p>\u201cIn this forest we find the wood to build our homes, the fruits and the <em>takus</em> [caterpillars] we eat \u2026 We gather plants, we hunt, we fish \u2013 it\u2019s our life,\u201d says Marie.<br></p> <p>Physically and spiritually connected to the forest, the Mbuti Pygmies have a traditional knowledge of their land, and have their own methods of conservation, which they call their \u201ctraditional technologies\u201d. </p> <p>\u201cWe know how to protect our forest because nobody knows it the way we do. We know where the animals give birth, where they sleep and during which periods one must never kill them,\u201d says Mapenzi, a young hunter.

However, feelings about the collaboration vary. For example, is recruiting rangers from among local communities a sufficient step to integrate them into the management of the project? \u201cNo,\u201d says L\u00f8vold. \u201cThe majority of conservation organisations have adopted the rhetoric of working with local communities, but in practice their approach remains very instrumentalising, which indicates that they engage members of the community for certain tasks but don\u2019t work deeply with them. It\u2019s not enough to give indigenous peoples a little job; one must truly implicate them in every step of the management of the ecosystem.\u201d</p> <p>In June, the Bambuti\u2019s efforts paid off <a href=\"http://www.berggorilla.org/en/gorillas/protected-areas/articles-protected-areas/the-itombwe-forest-is-now-protected-1/\">when the government officially recognised new boundaries of the reserve</a>, which were decided in consultation with local communities.</p> <p>Protecting the newly defined area requires sizeable investment, and the government depends entirely on international aid for the project\u2019s success. \u201cThe state itself cannot deliver sufficient support. WWF pays for everything here: my salary, this office, my house,\u201d says Lukangyu.</p> <p>The economic and social situation of local communities remains difficult. The Pygmies certainly want to conserve their lands and traditions, but they also want access to modern services such as health and education.</p> <p>\u201cPygmies are going through profound change,\u201d says Jean de Dieu Wasso, coordinator of Africapacity, a Bukavu-based organisation. \u201cThey have suffered forced displacements and violence within a general framework of discrimination as minorities \u2026 The community must be free to make its choices and to evolve. The important thing is to respect the international principle of self-determination, guaranteed by the <a href=\"http://www.un.org/esa/socdev/unpfii/documents/DRIPS_en.pdf\">declaration of the UN on the rights of indigenous peoples</a> [pdf].\u201d Wasso lives in the city now, but he has indigenous roots and has devoted the past 10 years of his life to supporting the Itombwe, maintaining the links between his people, the government and international partners.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"2fb5d98b1eaeb584105d42ffbcea09cda8b79271\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2fb5d98b1eaeb584105d42ffbcea09cda8b79271/0_0_1768_1179/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bambuti from the village of Kitale often welcome their guests with dance and song.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bambuti from the village of Kitale often welcome their guests with dance and song.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Riccardo Pravettoni</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Local communities are <a href=\"http://www.norway-geneva.org/OTHER-TOPICS/Preventing-loss-of-rainforest-in-Central-Africa/#.V716ZmVcRlo\">supported by the Norwegian government</a> through Africapacity, while WWF and WCS, the two most active conservation organisations in the reserve, mobilise funds for the project from the Netherlands and the US.

  "<p>A new documentary will offer uncompromising access into the workings of some of London\u2019s most brutal and notorious street gangs, using footage shot by the young people who operate within this world.</p> <p>Film-maker Paul Blake managed to get a rare insight into some of the 225 gangs that operate in Britain\u2019s capital, including shots of large weapons caches boasting dozens of guns and knives, and the packaging and selling of class-A drugs.</p> <p>Gangland, which is split between two episodes, gained unique access by giving the cameras to the gang members themselves and leaving it up to them to film what they wanted. Blake did not even make contact with the figures, but instead would leave the cameras at pre-arranged \u201cdead drops\u201d in central London and in parks \u2013 places without CCTV and where no one could be seen coming and going.</p> <p>He would then pick up the cameras later, without any knowledge of what footage they would contain.</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know the gang members who filmed, they didn\u2019t want me to meet them,\u201d said Blake. \u201cThis was about the control and the distance, and I was happy for that distance frankly because what came back was shocking.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e0b1c23a65eb86f4effbc0156924cb657ac169f4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e0b1c23a65eb86f4effbc0156924cb657ac169f4/120_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Commissioners told me it was an insignificant story, it\u2019s not relevant to the nation.

I was rebuffed at every attempt.\u201d</p> <p>He added: \u201cThis documentary was born from the fact that I am a black man, born in this country, and I was just pissed off that no one cared about these young black kids who are dying, they didn\u2019t care about the loss experienced by their families. Yet it could happen to me, it could happen to one of my friend\u2019s kids. It deeply upset me that this was going on for years but these kids just became faceless, just another nib in the Evening Standard.\u201d</p> <p>It was only in 2015 that Channel 5 commissioned the documentary. Blake, after years of building relationships within the world of street gangs, was able to find a group willing to speak to the camera and tell their stories. Yet in the midst of filming, it all went wrong. Two young gang members were sent to jail in the same week, and a week later another was shot. He survived but was taken in protective custody so filming became impossible and Blake was forced to start from scratch.</p> <p>It was then he landed on the idea of getting the gang members to film themselves, to overcome the obstacle that speaking to a journalist was perceived as snitching. It proved to be a fruitful but haunting process.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"19039b24b0ef7e7540cdec75c0b9a3bf882d15d6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/19039b24b0ef7e7540cdec75c0b9a3bf882d15d6/94_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018The first footage was of revolvers with copious amounts of drugs.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018A gang showing us not just what they do but why they do it is more shocking than people waving firearms around.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Maroon productions</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Blake said: \u201cThe first footage that came back was of the revolvers with the copious amounts of drugs. It was an entry into a world that I don\u2019t belong in, and having that distance was a reminder that my job was to help tell their story.\u201d</p> <p>The young men\u2019s willingness to speak to camera (with their faces hidden behind balaclavas) and talk not just about drugs and weapons but their own motivations and aspirations came with time, and Blake considers that some of the most revealing footage he received.</p> <p>\u201cI saw that they were not only showing us what they do, but also what they thought and why they do it,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s probably more shocking than people waving firearms around. Them talking about how they really wanted to make money but also put back into their community, how they just wanted to get on but if that meant taking from the next man, they would. And that wasn\u2019t a journalist or filmmaker saying that, it\u2019s them saying it.\u201d</p> <p>As well as offering raw and uncensored footage of moments such as drug dealers stuffing bag of drugs up their own orifices to hide them from police, the film also focuses on those individuals who are not in gangs but live surrounded by the culture \u2013 and are often the ones who end up dead.</p> <p>Blake found himself confronted with the awful reality of this when two young boys, neither of whom were in gangs but whom he had filmed for the second part of the documentary, both ended up dead after he finished shooting the documentary. Sixteen-year-old rappers Showkey and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/apr/14/myron-issac-yarde-and-the-community-grieving-a-lost-generation\">Myron Yarde</a> were killed in separate stabbings.

So it wasn\u2019t a surprise, really, but it was just incredibly sad and very hard to deal with on a personal level.\u201d</p> <p>As part of his filming, Blake recorded Yarde filming a music video and recalls how excited the 16-year-old had been about making music and was waiting on his GCSE results.</p> <p>The figures show that the problem of gang violence in London is on the rise again, with gang-related crime up 23% last year and over 6,000 incidents of serious youth violence this year. Blake said until people stopped dismissing it as a \u201cblack problem\u201d or an issue totally separate from their own lives, the death toll would continue to spiral.</p> <p>\u201cWe are telling this story because it means they are not faceless, they\u2019re not just some line in the newspaper that we all move on from instantly or don\u2019t even bother to read about in the first place,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is warfare on our own doorstep and young kids are dying.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 <em>Gangland: Turf Wars is on Channel 5 at 10pm on 1 and 8 September.</em></p>",

The law has, however, been largely ignored since being enacted.<br></p> <p>The coalition of organizations wrote to Lynch this week with their submission to a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/08/police-officer-related-deaths-department-of-justice\">consultation process opened last month by the Obama administration</a> on plans for a new justice department program to record all deaths in custody. </p> <p>The system, in which officials will contact departments to confirm deaths seen in media reports, mirrors The Counted, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/series/counted-us-police-killings\">an ongoing Guardian effort</a> to document all deaths caused by law enforcement in 2015 and 2016.<br></p> <p>The new government program is intended to improve on a discredited voluntary system run by the FBI, from which police were allowed to opt out. The FBI\u2019s annual count of \u201cjustifiable homicides\u201d has recorded only about half the true number of deaths in recent years.<br></p> <p>In their letter to Lynch, however, the campaign groups said the new government program did not go far enough to ensure comprehensive data collection. </p> <p>Henderson, of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, said the planned setup indicated that the justice department \u201cwould rather bend over backwards to accommodate police departments\u2019 dysfunction or reluctance\u201d than establish a compulsory system.<br></p> <p>The groups said the government had shown a \u201cdisturbing reliance\u201d on data collected by the Guardian and the Washington Post, which runs a count of fatal shootings by police. </p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s the government that should be providing journalists with transparent data, not the other way around,\u201d said Henderson, expressing concern that the new system would continue to place the onus on media to accurately report killings by police rather than the police themselves.<br></p> <p>\u201cCertain media outlets have been critical to understanding police-civilian encounters over the past year, but it is unlikely that national media attention and resources can remain on policing indefinitely,\u201d the letter said.<br></p> <p>The government\u2019s announcement last month did indicate that officials would not depend entirely on open source information such as media reports. It said all 19,450 law enforcement agencies will be sent <a href=\"http://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/DownloadDocument?objectID=59326201\">a form</a> by the BJS each quarter requiring information on all the department\u2019s arrest-related deaths.</p> <p>Deaths that were already noticed in media reports would be listed by the BJS for confirmation or correction by the local departments, according to the plan. But space will also be included for the department to list additional deaths that were not previously noticed. Departments that have seen no arrest-related deaths that quarter will be asked to return \u201can affirmative zero\u201d saying so.</p> <p>Nonetheless, according to the coalition\u2019s submission to the consultation this week, the justice department must use its power to penalize police departments financially if they do not comply with requests for information.<br></p> <p>\u201cIt will be difficult for DOJ to get an accurate picture of trends in custodial deaths if state and local law enforcement agencies are not held accountable for collecting data after a death occurs,\u201d the letter said.

Care staff are able to continue with their duties as the musicians play, often reporting that they, too, have benefited from the relaxing and calming mood the music engenders. </p> <p>I had started to think that high-quality, live, therapeutic music could help critically-ill patients after I was an ICU patient myself in 2015 following unexpected surgery. Thanks to the devotion of the clinical teams, I survived. I have spent every day since expressing gratitude for being alive, though I never anticipated that recovering my pre-illness life and livelihood was going to be as tough as it has been. </p> <p>One abiding memory of the ICU is constant, frightening noise. Imagine lying on a bed, unable to move, blink, speak or control your own pain relief. You may just about be conscious and aware of high levels of activity around your bed, around the clock. The whirring of machines and the ringing of alarms, bleeps and phones are part of the aural landscape, 24 hours a day. Hearing appears to be the only sense that still works. </p> <p>When I was moved off the ICU on to a high-dependency unit, I briefly heard singing from a television \u2013 beautiful, harmonious, melodic. The calming music temporarily blocked out the hospital noise and brought me into the present, reminding me I had a life to go back to. After hospital discharge, I\u2019d wake up in the night with the unnerving noises of ICU going round in my head. I learned to focus instead on remembering that one lovely sound \u2013 the singing. This aided my recovery. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/voluntary-sector-network/2016/jul/07/tweet-foodbank-twitter\">My first tweet was for custard, then tinned potatoes</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Through attending a Manchester patient support group, I met Natalie Mason, critical care followup lead at the royal infirmary ICU.

Thankfully, Music in Hospitals endorsed the idea and named it ICU-hear.</p> <p>It was a pilot \u2013 there is currently no research evidence of music therapy on adult in ICUs in the UK \u2013 but one that worked gratifyingly well.

His relatives were overcome. An otherwise stressful environment was momentarily transformed.</p> <p>I spoke to relatives afterwards. Their feedback was overwhelmingly positive. Far from feeling it inappropriate to have had a music performance in an environment where their relatives were gravely ill, they thought it had been a welcome and heartening respite. </p> <p>More hospitals are now interested in the ICU-hear project, which is being fully evaluated.

  "<p>As the summer ends, so begins the autumn film-festival season, more than ever inextricably linked with the end-of-year scrabble for awards that culminates in the Oscars in February 2017. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/aug/10/oscars-2017-predictions-movie-reviews-film-festival-favorites\">The first shots have been fired</a>, pundits are already talking up potential contenders, and the slow rollout of the actual films has begun. However, no single showcase has proved more talismanic in recent years than the Venice film festival, which has hosted the world premiere of the best picture Oscar winner for the last two years in succession \u2013 Spotlight and Birdman \u2013 and the biggest winner, numerically speaking, the year before that, with Gravity.</p> <p>This year, Venice\u2019s big pitch for Oscar augury is La La Land, a Los Angeles-set musical starring Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone, and directed by Damien Chazelle as a follow-up to his remarkable jazz-class drama Whiplash; La La Land has been given the prestigious opening-gala slot. Described by the Venice film festival\u2019s director Alberto Barbera as \u201ca wonderful film, a classical musical, and a marvellous tribute to American cinema from a contemporary perspective\u201d, La La Land would appear to have instantly surged into the front rank of awards season contenders. Barbera is diffident as to Venice\u2019s ability to confer automatic Oscar-statuette potential on to his picks \u2013 \u201cI\u2019ve been lucky for the last three years; I couldn\u2019t have imagined when I first saw Gravity or Birdman they would win all those Oscars\u201d \u2013 but admits he has put considerable effort into attracting major Hollywood players in recent years.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"5512e265fc28f02ee0009ccabf14778c52256168\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5512e265fc28f02ee0009ccabf14778c52256168/0_0_3052_1925/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone in La La Land\" width=\"1000\" height=\"631\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Oscar augury \u2026 Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone in La La Land.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dale Robinette/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWe want Venice to be an important launching pad, the opening of the season, the real beginning of the race for the Oscar.\u201d As well as making regular trips to New York and Los Angeles to chat up studio executives and preview material, Barbera says \u201cwe have invested a lot: we renovated the theatres, improved the quality of the screenings, as well as the general location and the services we are able to offer industry visitors.\u201d By the latter, he means such initiatives as a fully fledged film market, which has been operating since 2012, and which has morphed into a production and development programme called Venice Production Bridge, or a \u201cgap-financing\u201d platform for film-makers looking for extra investment.</p> <p>Barbera\u2019s prescience has also proved crucial in Venice\u2019s increasingly effective ability to fight its corner against its direct competitors in the film festival calendar: the boutique event in Telluride, Colorado, which begins on 2 September, and the giant-scale Toronto film festival, which kicks off on 8 September. As recently as 2012, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/aug/28/toronto-film-festival-rival-venice\">industry observers considered</a> that Venice appeared to be lagging well behind, trading on its reputation as the world\u2019s oldest festival (having been founded in 1932) but struggling to attract the best films. But now the position is almost completely reversed, with Barbera making the case successfully to Hollywood producers that the extra expense of sending a film to Italy is worth it.</p> <p>\u201cFive years ago, the competition with Toronto and Telluride was very strong. For the American majors it was clear that it was easier, and cheaper, to take their films to Toronto. They could make the promotion for their domestic campaign for their films, and start their campaign for the Oscar.\u201d Venice\u2019s old-world glamour has been transformed into a potent weapon \u2013 \u201call the talent are happy to come to Venice, they like Cipriani\u2019s, the hotels, the food and so on, the red carpet here you cannot get with our competitors\u201d \u2013 as well as its more selective programme based around the competition for the Golden Lion. \u201cIt\u2019s very different,\u201d says Barbera, \u201cfrom arriving in Toronto in the middle of 300 films, where you risk getting lost in a huge lineup.\u201d </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"472248fb24de123056a0ff0b1db0c358e8b7ce80\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/472248fb24de123056a0ff0b1db0c358e8b7ce80/42_315_3301_1981/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Michael Fassbender and Alicia Vikander in The Light Between Oceans\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hundred-tissue weepie \u2026 Michael Fassbender and Alicia Vikander in The Light Between Oceans.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/TOUCHSTONE PICTURES</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Perhaps even more important than the intra-festival politicking over world premieres is the current wealth of American cinema in general, which means Venice\u2019s wooing of Hollywood is paying off. In Barbera\u2019s words: \u201cThis is a very strong period for American cinema \u2013 [there] are lot of big, big films around.\u201d La La Land will be joined on the Lido by the likes of The Light Between Oceans, the heartrending weepie starring Michael Fassbender and Alicia Vikander, Terrence Malick\u2019s documentary Voyage of Time, Nocturnal Animals, the second film from fashion designer Tom Ford, and Arrival, a first-contact alien sci-fi thriller directed by Denis Villeneuve.</p> <p>Inevitably, other areas of the film-making universe appear relatively neglected, with Venice unable to command quite the same level of participation from the elite of international auteur directors as Cannes \u2013 though Barbera is emphatic he is not competing with the venerable French festival staged each May. \u201cCannes comes before us in the year. The studios don\u2019t like to show a film too far ahead of its release, so Venice is better for the American films that want to come out in the autumn. The films that are ready in the first half of the year go to Cannes: it is a matter of timing.\u201d </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2016/jul/20/40-films-predict-premiere-venice-toronto-telluride-festivals\">Festival fever: 40 films we predict will premiere at Venice, Toronto and Telluride</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Perhaps more surprising is Venice\u2019s difficult relationship with its domestic industry. Not only do the most venerated contemporary Italian directors \u2013 Paolo Sorrentino, Nanni Moretti, Matteo Garrone \u2013 reserve their work primarily for Cannes, but those that do venture to Venice, such as Luca Guadagnino, can receive distinctly chilly receptions: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/sep/06/tilda-swinton-a-bigger-splash-ralph-fiennes-venice-film-festival\">Guadagnino\u2019s A Bigger Splash was booed at its premiere last year</a>. Barbera is resigned to what he calls a \u201cprejudice\u201d on the part of the Italian film industry who are unwilling, he suggests, to grapple with a hostile press corps. On the other hand, he says he rejects numerous home films for \u201cnot being strong enough\u201d. A special screening of the first two episodes of Sorrentino\u2019s new TV drama The Young Pope, featuring Jude Law, may go some way to healing the breach.</p> <p>Barbera may also be playing with fire by programming Hacksaw Ridge, Mel Gibson\u2019s first film as director since a series of public controversies \u2013 including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2006/dec/08/melgibson\">an antisemitic outburst during a DUI arrest in 2006</a> and accusations of abuse <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/jul/02/mel-gibson-racist-rant\">against his then-partner Oksana Grigorieva</a>. Hacksaw Ridge is the story of Medal of Honor-winning conscientious objector Desmond T Doss, and Barbera says its inclusion is \u201ca quality issue\u201d. \u201cI was worried, of course, for all the reasons you expect, but when I saw the full film, I didn\u2019t have any doubts.\u201d</p> <ul> <li>The Venice film festival runs from 31 August-10 September.<br></li> </ul> <h2>Five to watch</h2> <p><strong>La La Land</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBUXcNTjviI\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/DBUXcNTjviI?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Everybody has been talking about this for months: a Hollywood-set musical about a jazz musician (Ryan Gosling) and the aspiring performer (Emma Stone) he falls for.

Nicolas Sarkozy, the former French president, who is seeking his party\u2019s nomination to run in 2017, used a speech at the weekend to call for the main Calais camp to be relocated to the UK.</p> <p>Sarkozy said: \u201cI\u2019m demanding the opening of a centre in Britain to deal with asylum seekers in Britain, so that Britain can do the work that concerns them. The Jungle should not be in Calais or anywhere else, because this is a republic and those with no rights to be here should return to their country.\u201d</p> <p>Sarkozy, who is running a hardline rightwing primary campaign, in effect called for a renegotiation of the Le Touquet agreement. Yet it was Sarkozy, when he was interior minister, who signed the agreement with Britain in 2003.</p> <p>Alain Jupp\u00e9, the mayor of Bordeaux who is favourite to become the right\u2019s candidate for the presidency next year, has also questioned the agreement, saying over the summer that \u201clogic dictates\u201d that border controls should happen on UK soil. </p> <p>Marine Le Pen, of the far-right Front National, who has strong support in Calais in northern France, is also campaigning on scrapping the current immigration deal. </p> <p>But at government level, the issue is complex as France battles to sort out its own asylum system issues. After the UK voted for Brexit in June, the Socialist government said there would be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/25/french-border-deal-wont-be-affected-by-brexit-paris\">no renegotiation</a> of the British-French immigration deal because it would not be in French interests. </p> <p>Cazeneuve warned that a change to the deal would send a signal to traffickers and smugglers that they could legitimately leave people at the French border to cross to England and would lead to tens of thousands more migrants in northern France. President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande said there would be \u201cno sense\u201d in changing the deal.</p> <p>The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, declined to comment directly on the fate of the Le Touquet agreement when asked after a campaign event in London, instead saying the burden of taking refugees should be better spread across the EU.</p> <p>\u201cThe point I always make about the refugee crisis across Europe is it has to be shared across the whole of the European union,\u201d he said. \u201cAt the moment Germany takes by far the largest proportion of Syrian asylum seekers and others. Some countries take none, and some take a very small number. The whole of Europe must recognise that we do have a moral duty to take a far greater number of asylum seekers all across Europe.\u201d</p> <p>He said the UK should particularly be more ready to process asylum claims for people with family links to the country, adding: \u201cWhere there are family connections of people in the camps with family in Britain then clearly they can apply, and often do.\u201d</p> <p>Corbyn condemned conditions in the main Calais camp, and similar ones along the coast in Dunkirk, both of which he has visited. \u201cI\u2019ve seldom seen anything so disgusting as those fetid camps in a land of plenty. It\u2019s not necessary,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Sir Peter Ricketts, a former British ambassador to France, warned on Monday that if a rightwing candidate won the presidential election next year, Britain \u201cis going to have to deal with a pretty serious conversation with France about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/25/french-border-deal-wont-be-affected-by-brexit-paris\">the Le Touquet agreement</a>\u201d.</p> <p>He said the UK was unlikely to accept the hotspot idea \u2013 adopted by the EU to tackle the crisis of mass migration from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East to Greece and Italy \u2013 warning that it would attract many more people to Calais. \u201cAs soon as you suggest that, it becomes a huge magnet,\u201d added Ricketts.</p>",
  "<p> Secure housing was a founding principle of the welfare state and meant young people without a family to fall back on used to be able to rely on the safety net of social housing. </p> <p> But that has all changed.

Instead, young people at risk of homelessness are stuck in temporary housing or pushed into renting privately.

Funding is allocated to bed spaces and whoever fills them, so the support for young people does not go with them when it\u2019s time to leave. </p> <p> Housing providers and local authorities work hard to prepare young people to manage their future homes, but day-to-day it tends to be easier and more time-efficient for key workers to take control. Subsequently, young people gain no experience of being independent before they have to do it for real, on their own. Sadly, as their main option for housing is now in the private rented sector, this inexperience often leads to eviction.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/housing-network/gallery/2016/may/18/social-housing-tenants-demonised-housing-planning-act-in-pictures\">Social housing tenants who feel 'demonised as second-class citizens' \u2013 in pictures</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In 2014, I spent five months working in a 115-bed hostel for 16- to 22-year-olds in Lambeth, south London. I witnessed first hand many of the traps created by poor policymaking and service design. For example, great emphasis is put on young people gaining employment, yet in reality they can rarely take on full-time work \u2013 their rent would be devastatingly high without full housing benefit.</p> <p>Convinced we could create better outcomes for young people and housing providers alike, my colleague Rich Grahame and I set up a social enterprise called <a href=\"http://wearesettle.org/\">Settle</a>. Together, we design and deliver training and support to young people who have been homeless and are now moving into their first home.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/housing-network/2016/jul/27/domestic-violence-victims-homelessness-centrepoint\">Domestic violence victims are disappearing from homeless statistics</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Our programmes are designed to tackle the main causes of youth homelessness \u2013 debt, anti-social behaviour and social isolation \u2013 but we try to focus on the positive. Often homelessness services are focused on a person\u2019s deficits, ie what they\u2019re lacking, be it housing, employment or skills. Instead, our work is asset based \u2013 we help participants understand how their experiences have made them resilient and build upon their existing strengths.</p> <p>Our curriculum covers three areas: managing money, maintaining a home and having a good lifestyle. Programmes are delivered one-to-one, beginning with an assessment where participants talk about their goals, existing skills and how they like to learn. Each session is then tailored to that young person\u2019s needs.</p> <p>The response to our work has been really encouraging. We have secured contracts to work with 70 young people living with four housing providers, across five local authorities. One year on from our first pilot, all of our participants have sustained their tenancies or had a positive move. </p> <p>The best part of my job is when the young people I\u2019m working with begin to direct our sessions. In one case, a participant had realised that the security of their housing rested on their ability to manage their mental health. They mapped out the various services available to them and committed to investigating new forms of self care. These flashes of self-awareness and initiative make me proud and bitter all at once.</p> <p>While the individual successes we have through Settle makes me proud of the work we do, it\u2019s devastating to realise how needed we are. More and more young people are facing the threat of homelessness and as long as temporary housing and the private rented sector are the only options for them, it\u2019s going to take a lot for vulnerable young people to build an independent future.</p> <p><em>Kate Slee is co-founder and service designer of <a href=\"http://www.wearesettle.org/\">Settle</a>.</em></p> <p><a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/housing/register/\"><strong>Join the Guardian Housing Network </strong></a><strong>to read more pieces like this and follow us on Twitter </strong><strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/GuardianHousing\">@GuardianHousing</a> </strong><strong>to keep up with the latest social housing insight and analysis.</strong></p>",
  "<h2><em>\u2018It\u2019s clearly doing something right\u2019 </em><em>- </em>Canary Wharf Jazz Festival</h2> <p>The Canary Wharf Jazz Festival is a free two day jazz music event held each August in Canada Square Park in London\u2019s Docklands. The performers, many of whom have received music industry awards, are all UK based. The festival feels local with the audience travelling in each day. I went with my partner and 14-year-old daughter. Julia Biel was the performer we enjoyed seeing most this year. </p> <p>The environment is very family friendly. The organisers even hand out picnic mats to people who haven\u2019t brought their own. One year when it started to rain, they offered everyone plastic ponchos. This year was the Canary Wharf Jazz Festival\u2019s tenth anniversary and it was very well attended, so it\u2019s clearly doing something right. I\u2019ll certainly be back next year. <em><strong>Alex Flynn</strong></em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"84d7d0f81c14a0ea05abb26d45beab850878b2f6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/84d7d0f81c14a0ea05abb26d45beab850878b2f6/0_0_1200_756/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Supremely talented jazz vocalist Julia Biel and band smile and play on as strong winds force open the back curtains and blow across the stage at the Canary Wharf Jazz Festival, London 20 August 2016.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"630\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Supremely talented jazz vocalist Julia Biel and band smile and play on as strong winds force open the back curtains and blow across the stage at the Canary Wharf Jazz Festival, London 20 August 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AlexFlynn/GuardianWitness</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><em>\u2018The festival has stolen my heart\u2019 - </em>Sunflowerfest 2016, Northern Ireland<br></h2> <p>I lived in London for 25 years but moved to Northern Ireland five years ago. I\u2019ve been going to Sunflowerfest every summer since. The festival is very well organised with different sections for family camping, singles camping, rowdy camping, showers utilising compost for energy and various activities for kids.</p> <p>The festival focuses mainly on local musicians, but a few fairly big name bands always headline the event. There\u2019s always a great atmosphere, with the bands enjoying themselves around the festival when they\u2019re not performing. My favourite performers were the band The Twisted Sisters - an irreverent bunch who sing songs about Guinness, potatoes and big knickers! Apart from the headliners they attract the biggest crowd. I also really enjoy a singer called Amanda St John who has a big band soul and jazz sound. The harpist Ursula Burns was great too. I used to go to the festivals in England such as Reading every summer. I loved them but Sunflowerfest, although being a lot smaller and a completely different kettle of fish, has stolen my heart and will always be my favourite festival experience. <strong><em>Debbie Deboo</em></strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"caff5ce0c85a29f5e1f54259790756d7a7247da3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/caff5ce0c85a29f5e1f54259790756d7a7247da3/0_0_1182_1042/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sunflowerfest 2016 - \u2018it will always be my favourite summer festival experience\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"882\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sunflowerfest 2016 - \u2018it will always be my favourite summer festival experience\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Debbie Deboo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><em>\u2018The whole crew is like a giant family\u2019 -</em> Eisteddfod, Wales</h2> <p>I\u2019m from a village just a few miles away from Llangollen in north-east Wales, where the Eisteddfod festival is held every year. I haven\u2019t missed a festival since I was born, so I\u2019ve been to 20 of them. 21 If you count when Mum was five months pregnant with me. </p> <p>I was working there this year. I\u2019m part of the sound crew on the main stage, which I\u2019ve continued to do every year since I did it for Year 10 work experience. The festival is generally well organised, although it had a few hiccups as with any event of its scale. People come for the wide variety of competitions during the daytime. Others come for the evening concerts that are the main attractions. This year the biggest names were Collabro, Bryn Terfel and Jools Holland. Others just come onto the field for the stalls, performances on the outside stages or the general buzz of all the international competitors. </p> <p>The best experience is definitely working with the rest of the sound and backstage crew during the week, and doing so on such a unique festival just a few miles from my home in a gorgeous setting. The whole crew is like a giant family. In addition meeting people from so many different countries and creating friendships over the week is brilliant. I\u2019ll be doing it again without a doubt! <strong><em>Eluned Ashwood</em></strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"870d98a66904507e5be8846dd7acea01232a134e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/870d98a66904507e5be8846dd7acea01232a134e/0_0_640_640/500.jpg\" alt=\"Llangollen International Musical Eisteddfod\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Llangollen International Musical Eisteddfod</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Eluned Ashwood/GuardianWitness</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><em>\u2018It\u2019s a perfect way to discover more of my country\u2019s diverse culture\u2019 - </em>Sinulog, Philippines</h2> <p>I\u2019m originally from Cebu, Philippines. Sinulog is a yearly event in the city, where dancers from the different provinces in the Philippines perform. That\u2019s the main attraction. Every contingent of dancers will have their different custom themes and usually surprise and stun the audience in equal measure with their performances. This year I went with a colleague. There\u2019s always a plethora of people there, more or less three million, and I wish more would be done about crowd control. </p> <p>Sinulog is a cultural fiesta and is a perfect way for me and others to witness and discover more of my country\u2019s diverse culture. I\u2019m a history buff and anything that is cultural for me is great. It\u2019s a busy street parade and you have to do a lot of walking. Commuting is very hard at that time. Each year more and more contingents are joining, not only in the Visayas region but also in Mindanao \u2013 a region that\u2019s very rich in culture and where tribal traditions are still evident. I\u2019ll definitely go again. <strong><em>Jennin Bartolata</em></strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5deae46a6722bfc22fea15da4812d3d6e86312bb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5deae46a6722bfc22fea15da4812d3d6e86312bb/0_0_1856_1233/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dancers at Sinulog - an annual cultural and religious festival held in Cebu, Philippines\" width=\"1000\" height=\"664\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dancers at Sinulog - an annual cultural and religious festival held in Cebu, Philippines</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jennin Bartolata</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>\u2018</strong><em>You do need to enjoy a party</em><strong><em>\u2019 - </em>The Berlin Carnival</strong><br></h2> <p>This was my first time in Berlin, but I joined my sister who has been many times. A group of 18 of us travelled. We met more Londoners once we were there. The festival was very well organised. It all started with a J\u2019Ouvert party, where festival goers cover each other in paint and power. This was swiftly followed by a fire fete, boat party, roof top party, beach party, glow party, the actual carnival day and a closing party. There was no trouble, no problems, and plenty of rum. You do need to enjoy a party though! <br></p> <p>Ricardo Drue, Patrice Roberts and Lyrical were headlining the event, but I think most people were really looking forward to the selection of DJs who had flown in from around the world. These included Private Ryan from Trinidad and Tobago, American DJ Stephen and DJ Tate and Triple M from the UK. Flying home on a Tuesday with a hangover was tough but worth it. <strong><em>Katrina Frazer</em></strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"add770f5fb186f355e2c23566969bfc56e62d558\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/add770f5fb186f355e2c23566969bfc56e62d558/0_0_1200_778/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Berlin Carnival Beach Party 2016\" width=\"1000\" height=\"648\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Berlin Carnival Beach Party 2016</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Katrina Frazer/GuardianWitness</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><em>\u2018It\u2019s a a wonderful piece of popular Andalusian culture\u2019 -</em> Sherry Festival, Spain</h2> <p>This summer I was at the<strong> </strong>Sherry Festival in the Spanish town of Sanlucar.

The festival was very well organised with a cabaret and music tent, various sherry producers with outlets and a fairground.

Thousands of Brits head to the sleepy island of Pag in Croatia every summer to see the best DJs on the planet. As the focus is on dance music, it felt like lots of people had come to enjoy the vibe and the parties, rather than to see one specific act. Then again, Craig David was a highlight for me and plenty of others! </p> <p>The festival was really well organised. The combination of the beach and guaranteed sunshine made for a great experience. I thought it was a shame it was nearly all Brits attending. I\u2019d hoped it might feel a little more international. Rather than going to this one again, I\u2019d prefer to check out some other festivals around Croatia in the future. There are plenty of new ones to discover every year.</p> <p>My favourite ever summer festival experience was seeing Stevie Wonder at British Summer Time in Hyde Park a few years ago. I remember the sun was just setting as he played \u201cYou Are The Sunshine Of My Life\u201d.

The arching shape of the venue amphitheatre just seemed to lock the sound in with us, under the stars, by the waters edge. And the photo I took of Catfish and the Bottlemen was how the music felt to me. They really did get great feedback from the crowd. The venue space was limited, but it was really well organised.

I grew up speaking French, Arabic and sometimes Berber. My childhood was filled with summers by the beach, simple pleasures like eating fresh watermelon on the sand, Friday visits to the market with my father and the weekly traditional couscous with a glass of leben, a dairy beverage. But the innocence of my childhood was soon disrupted by a civil war. </p> <p>Algeria experienced an \u201cArab Fall\u201d in 1988, which led to a war between armed Islamic groups and the Algerian army and state. Many journalists, intellectuals, artists were among about 200,000 Algerians who died under the blades and bullets of these fanatic murderers. Almost overnight, the face of Algerian society changed and entered one of the darkest times of its history.</p> <p>During the paroxysm of the war in the mid-90s, my parents decided that it was safer to temporarily move to France, as my mother had received death threats. It was a return \u201chome\u201d for her as she was born and raised in France by immigrant Algerian parents. <br></p> <p>I remember feeling grateful that I could finally walk down the street without being scared. But yet, I often felt out of place. I encountered racism for the first time and discovered what it was to be an outsider. I was surprised to discover that Algerians were not exactly well received and welcome. I did not know then, considering my age, the complicated intricacies inherited from colonial times. <br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/23/american-dream-trailer-park-i-couldnt-be-happier\">My American dream led to a trailer park.

I was very critical of American foreign policy \u2013 especially the war in Iraq. My political views have not drastically changed since then, but they have become more nuanced and pragmatic. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p> In the summer of 2007, I moved to Ohio to participate in an exchange program. It all happened by accident as I missed the deadline for the exchange programs in England and the only anglophone country left was the US. It was never my dream to visit America, much less live here.</p> <p>I soon discovered the privilege of teaching and learning in a liberal arts college with a diverse community. I became aware of the multiple subcultures of this gigantic country that is the United States and I remember being amazed by how people considered America their home while also remaining proud of their ethnic or cultural background. <br></p> <p>That didn\u2019t negate the persisting racism and the presence of the dark cloud of slavery floating over America. Yet, those years ended up being among the most enriching of my life. I slowly fell in love with this heterogeneous society. I could finally say that I was Algerian without being apprehensive of how people would respond. America also allowed me to appreciate and embrace my \u201cFrenchness\u201d \u2013 up until then, I did not really know how French I was.

  "<p>In the US, virtually none of the chemicals used in personal care products are independently evaluated for safety. Americans of all ages use these products every day \u2013 from lotion to shampoo, makeup to deodorant, hair dye to shaving cream \u2013 and many of the chemicals they contain are rapidly absorbed by the skin. </p> <p> With increasing evidence that certain chemicals in personal care products are linked to a variety of health concerns, there is an urgent need to update the 80-year-old federal rules aimed at ensuring their safety. </p> <p> Formaldehyde, which is used in Brazilian blowouts, has been associated with headaches and shortness of breath in the short term, and cancer in the long term. </p> <p> Endocrine-disrupting chemicals, which are used as preservatives in creams, lotions and shampoos, have been linked to diabetes, obesity, reproductive disorders and even cancer.</p> <p> And lead acetate, which is used in men\u2019s hair dye, has also been linked to cancer. </p> <p> The European Union and Canada have reviewed the ingredients in personal care products for decades. More than 1,500 chemicals are banned or restricted in Europe, while more than 800 are banned or restricted in Canada. </p> <p> Due to outdated US laws, only 11 substances are banned or restricted. It\u2019s long past time for the US to catch up.</p> <p> The Personal Care Products Safety Act would finally address this glaring safety loophole. </p> <p> The central component of the bill is an FDA review process for ingredients. The FDA would review at least five chemicals a year, chosen based on input from consumers, medical professionals, scientists and companies. </p> <p> This process would address which chemicals can continue to be used in personal care products and, if so, what the concentration levels should be. </p> <p>The FDA may determine that some chemicals, such as endocrine-disrupting chemicals, are not appropriate in any products, or are only appropriate in small amounts. </p> <p> The key for many chemicals may be how much is used. We need to know at what concentration these chemicals are unsafe. </p> <p> For example, after conducting a scientific review, the FDA may determine that a particular chemical is only safe at a concentration of 10 parts per million. </p> <p> Going forward, all companies would need to reformulate their products so they contained no more than 10 parts per million of that ingredient.</p> <p> Companies would still have the power to adopt a stricter standard. They could use less of a particular ingredient, or not use certain ingredients at all, but the ingredient review process would finally create a uniform safety standard. </p> <p> The bill would also require companies to report adverse health effects. An ongoing investigation into the popular hair cleanser Wen highlights the need for this provision. </p> <p> A class action lawsuit alleging significant hair loss has been filed on behalf of thousands of consumers, and the FDA has received 127 complaints about the product. </p> <p> During the course of its investigation, the FDA discovered that a staggering 21,000 complaints had been registered with the company. Under our bill, the manufacturer would have been required to tell the FDA about all complaints related to negative health effects. </p> <p> In addition, the bill would require companies to register with the FDA and provide a list of their ingredients, with a range of concentration for each one. </p> <p> Warning labels would be required for products not appropriate for children, and complete label information, including ingredients and product warnings, would be posted online to ensure that consumers can make informed decisions. </p> <p> Lastly, the FDA would be given the authority to recall products that cause serious harm.</p> <p> Our bill has the broad bipartisan support needed to move forward. Consumer and health groups, including the Environmental Working Group, Endocrine Society and Good Housekeeping Institute, and a wide range of companies support the bill. </p> <p> Industry support includes both the largest companies in the industry \u2013 Johnson &amp; Johnson, Procter &amp; Gamble and Unilever \u2013 as well as small and mid-size companies such as California Baby, Dr Bronner\u2019s and Madison Reed. </p> <p> This marks the first time federal legislation on this issue has earned the support of both consumer and industry groups. These commonsense proposals are long overdue and the US Senate should act. Consumers deserve to know that the products they and their families use every day are safe. </p>",

  "<p>The racist posts on Nextdoor.com became so frequent that they started to make Shikira Porter feel physically ill.</p> <p>Billed as a \u201cprivate social network for your neighborhood\u201d, Nextdoor allows users to write public messages to neighbors who have joined the site, which now has more than 110,000 local groups across the US. After Porter, who is black, signed up in her Oakland, California, neighborhood in 2013, she quickly discovered that many of her white neighbors were posting \u201ccrime and safety\u201d alerts about \u201csuspicious\u201d people of color.</p> <p>A black man in a hoodie. A Latino man \u201chiding near the bus stop\u201d.

While some say Nextdoor has taken a bold and proactive step with its new features, the dispute sheds light on increasingly tense debates surrounding the ethical obligations of social media and sharing economy companies that are reinventing communication and reshaping industries.</p> <p>To critics of corporations such as Facebook, Twitter and Airbnb, the cycle of tech scandals has become frustratingly familiar: driven by profits and public relations, the firms refuse to make substantive changes, often at the expense of their most vulnerable users.</p> <h2>A \u2018fundamental\u2019 shift</h2> <p>Nextdoor claims its anti-profiling measures are radical changes that will dramatically reduce racism on the site. The concept behind the tweaks, however, is fairly simple and rooted in ideas that California activists <a href=\"http://www.eastbayexpress.com/SevenDays/archives/2015/10/28/nextdoorcom-executives-meet-with-oakland-activists-discuss-efforts-to-combat-racial-profiling\">suggested</a> last fall.</p> <p>Under the new system, before members can post a crime and safety message, the site warns them about profiling, saying: \u201cAsk yourself \u2013 is what I saw actually suspicious, especially if I take race or ethnicity out of the equation?\u201d</p> <p>Next, users are encouraged to focus on behaviors and specific descriptions, such as clothing, shoes and tattoos.

All lookouts have their own individual oddities.\u201d </p> <p>The challenge, Haugen said, was to accept nature\u2019s rhythm. \u201cNew lookouts often have all these plans, they\u2019re going to read all these books, or paint, or photograph, or learn an instrument.

Each time helicopters and ground crews doused the blazes before they exploded. </p> <p>Upon spotting smoke, a lookout uses a table-sized 360-degree compass known as a fire finder to identify the location, then relays it to base. Twice Brinegar has confused mist known as water dogs with smoke, a common rookie mistake. \u201cI\u2019ve learned to take my time if I\u2019m not sure, wait maybe 10 minutes before calling it.\u201d</p> <p>Most days are uneventful: rise at 7am, breakfast on military rations (there is electricity and a stove but the former infantry soldier prefers rations to cooking), check in with base, scope the landscape, measure humidity, file a weather report, lunch, more scoping, a supper of potatoes and sausages, maybe a DVD, sunset, bed. </p> <p>Brinegar savors the solitude.

  "<p>Amid the summer lull, it\u2019s time for a little speculative takeover talk.</p> <p>Analysts at RBC have been looking as satellite communication specialist <strong>Inmarsat</strong> and run the rule over the business as a possible bid target. In a new note, RBC\u2019s Wilton Fry said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Given Inmarsat\u2019s lower share price (especially in US dollar terms), rapid evolution of the industry\u2019s competitive landscape, and historical precedents (e.g., Sky Terra approach in 2009), we believe it is appropriate to consider potential M&amp;A activity. In this note we assess whether there is any rationale for Echostar, or Dish, to approach Inmarsat. </p> <p>Echostar and its sister company Dish Network have recently raised financing and Echostar now has around $3bn in cash on its balance sheet. This money is most likely to be used to fund new satellites at Echostar. However, there is a possibility, in our view, that Echostar or Dish may consider approaching Inmarsat given the compelling strategic and operational logic of a combination; as such, we believe this is a valid topic for investor debate. </p> <p>A bid for Inmarsat could help solve the jigsaw puzzle: We see a number of interlocking situations: (a) Dish has a lot of US spectrum but needs terrestrial deployment; (b) Echostar and Inmarsat both own European S band that could be used for mobile; (c) Mobile needs spectrum given data growth; (d) Deutsche Telekom is involved with Inmarsat\u2019s S-band project and owns T Mobile USA; (e) Inmarsat is global but needs needs more Ka-band; and (f) Echostar has Ka-band but wants to expand globally...</p> <p>We think combining a regional/deep operator like Echostar with a global/ shallow operator like Inmarsat would fulfill Echostar\u2019s global aspirations and help Inmarsat\u2019s need to add capacity in dense areas. We also think it could protect Echostar\u2019s Hughes business, enhance in-flight opportunities, and confront ViaSat\u2019s aspirations whilst simultaneously yielding substantial operational savings from combined satellite control functions. </p> <p>Despite Inmarsat\u2019s larger size ($5.0bn versus $3.6bn) and rating (around 10 times versus 5 times 2017 estimated EBITDA), Echostar has plenty of cash ($3bn) and lower leverage. As an illustration, a 37% premium (12.5 times 2017 estimated EBITDA) with 30% cash/70% equity structure would result in NewCo leverage of 3.2 times net debt/ EBITDA pre- synergies, in line with Inmarsat\u2019s current leverage. </p> </blockquote> <p>RBC has a target price of \u00a311.50 a share on Inmarsat.

The figures shed light on the violence it wrought as it surged into Iraq in 2014 and conquered the plains of Nineveh, killing and enslaving thousands of members of the Yazidi religious minority as well as members of the Shia community.</p> <p>Further mass graves are expected to be uncovered as Isis retreats in the face of offensives by a US-led coalition and allied forces on the ground in Iraq and Syria, ceding ground outside of Mosul and Raqqa, the two most populous cities under its control.</p> <p>The study identified 17 mass graves in Syria alone, including one with the bodies of hundreds of members of a single tribe that was largely exterminated when Isis captured the region. </p> <p>Sinjar mountain, in Iraq, where the Yazidis took refuge as the militants raided their ancestral home, contains six burial sites and the bodies of more than 100 people.</p> <p>Some areas where mass graves were uncovered are still too dangerous for a comprehensive excavation that would provide an accurate count of the victims. </p> <p>Isis has often flaunted its mass atrocities, justifying the enslavement and murder of the Yazidis on obtuse religious grounds, and publishing propaganda videos and images of its crimes. </p> <p>Its most infamous large-scale killings were the Camp Speicher massacre in Iraq, when the group murdered more than 1,500 Shia army cadets in Tikrit, Saddam Hussein\u2019s birthplace, and the August 2014 massacre of more than 700 members of the Shaitat tribe in eastern Syria for their opposition to Isis rule. </p> <p>One site outside the Badoush prison in Iraq is believed to contain the bodies of 600 inmates killed by the militants in their summer 2014 rampage.<br></p> <p>This month Iraq\u2019s judiciary <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/21/iraq-hangs-men-convicted-speicher-massacre-shia-tikrit\">sentenced 36 people to death</a> for involvement in the Camp Speicher massacre. But otherwise there has been little accountability for the group\u2019s crimes, which in addition to its killings include the exile of much of Iraq\u2019s Christian community from their ancestral homes in Nineveh, and the destruction of cultural heritage.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/08/isis_mass_graves-zip/giv-31075xC80JkDXI52f/\" data-alt=\"Map\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/08/isis_mass_graves-zip/giv-31075xC80JkDXI52f/\">Map</a> </figure>  <p>Rather than obscure its crimes, Isis publicises them with well-produced videos and images. Video of the killings of Shia cadets in Camp Speicher was published by the group\u2019s social media outlets shortly after they took place, sparking outrage and condemnation.</p> <p>In media outlets such as its magazine Dabiq, Isis speaks openly of its intention to exterminate the Yazidis, denigrating the group as devil worshippers and heretics.</p> <p>In addition to massacring minorities, the group also makes a point of killing anyone who opposes it in conquered territories. After seizing the Tabqa airbase from the Syrian regime, the group killed dozens of soldiers captured during the offensive.</p> <p>The Associated Press estimated the number of known victims at between 5,200 and more than 15,000, a figure the agency described as staggering. The largest mass grave is believed to hold thousands of victims.</p> <p>Activists in Syria believe there are hundreds of mass graves in Isis-controlled areas that can only be explored when the fighting stops. By that time, they fear any effort to document the massacres and exhume and identify the remains will become infinitely more complicated.</p> <p>The mass graves themselves appear to be relatively easy to find, and have emerged whenever territory has been liberated from Isis control. The militants do little to hide the evidence. </p> <p>\u201cThey don\u2019t even try to hide their crimes,\u201d Sirwan Jalal, the director of Iraqi Kurdistan\u2019s agency in charge of mass graves, told AP. \u201cThey are beheading them, shooting them, running them over in cars, all kinds of killing techniques, and they don\u2019t even try to hide it.\u201d </p>",
  "<p>When 14-year-old Amina got married last year, the occasion was solemn. Rather than the flamboyance that often characterises Nigerian nuptials this was a subdued affair, attended only by a few family members and close friends.</p> <p>The bride and groom knew each other, but they had not been in a relationship. Rather Amina, not her real name, was marrying one of three men who had gang-raped her in her village when she was 13 years old. </p> <p>Usaini Ja\u2019afar and his accomplices had confessed to the crime under interrogation by the Hisbah board, a religious police force responsible for the enforcement of Sharia law in the northern Nigerian state of Kano. He pleaded for forgiveness and offered to marry Amina so as to escape punishment. </p> <p>Amina\u2019s father agreed and the men were allowed to walk free. </p> <p>\u201cI decided to temper justice with mercy,\u201d <a href=\"http://dailytrust.com.ng/weekly/index.php/new-news/18686-dad- allows-man- who-raped- daughter-wed- her\">said Amina\u2019s father</a>, explaining his decision not to press charges against the men who assaulted his daughter. \u201cI allowed him to marry the girl because our consultations with our Malams [Islamic clerics] showed that there is nothing wrong about that.\u201d</p> <p>Salahuddeen Armayau, who heads the Hisbah board, said the wedding had taken place last year, adding that the board had approved of the union because \u201cthe boy said he was willing to clear his mess, and even the victim\u2019s father gave his blessing\u201d. <br></p> <p>The marriage, which has been condemned by human rights activists, is just one example of how rapists are escaping justice in northern Nigeria\u2019s commercial capital. In a state where more than <a href=\"http://www.newsexpressngr.com/news/detail.php?news=21155&amp;amp;title=Kano-women-rise-%20against-rape\">100 cases of rape are reported each month</a>, only a handful suspects are ever prosecuted.<br></p> <p>Authorities say the majority of rape allegations are <a href=\"http://leadership.ng/news/339428/kano-records-100-rape-cases-in-2-months\">settled before they ever reach court</a>. Sometimes the accused get off by asking respected members of the community to testify on their behalf; sometimes they offer the family money in return for dropping the charges; sometimes they marry their victims. </p> <p>Even if charges are pressed, it can be hard to prosecute rape offences. </p> <p>\u201cSome of the victims are shy of speaking publicly about their ordeal in the hands of their rapists for fear of being stigmatised,\u201d said Agafi Kunduli, a prominent Nigerian human rights activist. </p> <p>\u201cThe police cannot prosecute without witnesses and this is one major reason why many rapists walk free.\u201d</p> <p>Police officers have even been accused of <a href=\"http://dailypost.ng/2016/04/08/ipo-asked-%20me-to-%20pay-n20000-%20to-arrest-%20man-who-%20raped-me-victim/\">demanding bribes from women</a> before arresting rape suspects.</p> <p>\u201cSome victims do not trust the police,\u201d said an officer in Abuja who once worked in Kano. \u201cWe cannot blame them because even policemen are also involved in this,\u201d he said, referring to the fact that a number of Kano police officers have themselves been accused of rape.</p> <p>In 2014, a police officer and four others were <a href=\"http://www.vanguardngr.com/2014/10/police-orderly-%204-others-%20gang-rape-%2017-year-old-%20girl-kano/\">arrested for allegedly gang-raping a 17-year- old</a> at gunpoint. Last year, another <a href=\"http://allafrica.com/stories/201505010419.html\">officer was alleged to have raped</a> a seven-year-old girl at police quarters in Kano. Neither officer has yet been prosecuted. </p> <p>Even in the case of rape and murder, offenders often avoid jail sentences. Murder victims include a 22-year-old pregnant woman who died after being <a href=\"http://thenationonlineng.net/pregnant-house-%20wife-raped-to-death-%20in-kano/\">gang-raped in her home early this year</a>, and a newlywed woman who was <a href=\"https://www.thecable.ng/newlywed-woman-%20raped-stabbed-%20to-death-%20in-kano\">killed by at least one rapist</a> in Sha\u2019iskawa village, north of Kano state. No one has yet been prosecuted in either case. </p> <p>Until last year, the <a href=\"http://www.vanguardngr.com/2015/10/rapists-to-face-14-years-jail-term-in-kano-says-govt/\">maximum sentence for rape </a>in Kano was two years, with the option of paying a fine instead<strong>. </strong> After an outcry, the <a href=\"http://www.premiumtimesng.com/regional/nwest/191133-%E2%80%8Brapists-to-face-14-year-jail-term-in-kano.html\">government introduced a minimum sentence of 14 years life sentence</a> in late 2015. </p> <p>There is no crime of rape under Sharia law, which runs parallel to the criminal justice system in Kano, but <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/reports/2004/nigeria0904/5.htm\">having sex outside of marriage</a> carries a sentence of death by stoning if the defendant is married or 100 lashes if they are not. In practice, however, the sentence is seldom enforced. </p> <p>Women\u2019s rights activists have called on authorities to do more to protect women and girls from sexual violence, and to ensure that rapists face justice. They say marriage should not be used as a way to escape justice.</p> <p><strong></strong>\u201cWe just have to keep encouraging victims to speak,\u201d said Kunduli. \u201cNo rapist should be allowed to go scot-free, even when he decides to marry the victim.\u201d</p> <p>Human rights lawyer, Eno Edet, said that the legal requirements to proving sexual assault needed rethinking, as they did not take into account the particular sensitivities involved in reporting rape. </p> <p>\u201cLaw makers should sit down, speak to victims, and put themselves in their shoes,\u201d said Edet, who has worked with a number of women who have been sexually assaulted. \u201cThe police should take their work seriously because rape changes lives.\u201d<br></p>",
  "<p>The number of areas where badgers will be culled to stop the spread of bovine tuberculosis is to more than triple under licences issued by the government on Tuesday.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Licensed shooters could <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/23/badger-cull-protesters-change-tactics-in-response-to-expansion\">begin killing badgers within days in Herefordshire, Cornwall and Devon</a>, which have been added to the culling already taking place in recent years in Gloucestershire, Somerset and Dorset.</p> <p>Ministers say the culling is essential to stop the spread of bovine TB to cattle, which cost the taxpayer \u00a3100m in 2015 to compensate farmers for slaughtered cattle. But experts <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jul/13/badger-cull-expansion-flies-in-face-of-scientific-evidence\">have said</a> the culls \u201cfly in the face of scientific evidence\u201d and could even make the problem worse.</p> <p>George Eustice, the farming minister, said the cull\u2019s expansion was vital to tackle the \u201creservoir\u201d of the disease in badgers. \u201cOur comprehensive strategy to eradicate bovine TB in England is delivering results, with more than half the country on track to be free of the disease by the end of this parliament.\u201d</p> <p>In total, 10 areas have now been licensed for culling, up from three areas previously. Ministers also announced the provision of more information and advice on cattle movements and biosecurity measures and a consultation on the use of more sensitive tests.</p> <p>The National Farmers Union welcomed the move. Meurig Raymond, the NFU president, said: \u201cFarmers facing a daily battle against bTB in those areas that have been granted licences for badger control operations this year will welcome the news that finally action is being taken to tackle the reservoir of disease in wildlife in these areas. </p> <p>\u201cToday\u2019s announcement means that badger control will now be taking place in 10% of the area where cattle are at the highest risk of contracting bTB.\u201d</p> <p>But scientists, Labour and animal welfare groups condemned the expansion and said it would not stop the disease. Prof Rosie Woodroffe, at the Institute of Biology in London, said: \u201cThis is a huge disappointment for evidence-based policy making. The scale of the rollout is huge: farmers will be required to kill almost 10,000 badgers at a minimum before the end of November. And yet the government has released no evidence that farmer-led culling is helping to control cattle TB.\u201d</p> <p>Rachel Maskell, shadow environment secretary, said: \u201cThe decision to extend the badger cull flies in the face of the government\u2019s own evidence that shows the killing of thousands of badgers has not reduced the number of cattle contracting bovine TB. The government promised when they embarked on the cull that it would be an evidence based approach, yet they are failing to take any notice of the facts.\u201d</p> <p>Dominic Dyer, CEO of the Badger Trust, said: \u201cDefra statistics show that despite killing thousands of badgers the number of cattle slaughtered for TB continues to rise in and around the cull zones. We could kill ever badger in Britain but bovine TB would continue to spread in cattle herds, due to inaccurate TB testing, excessive numbers of cattle movements and poor bio security controls.</p> <p>\u201cThe badger is being used as a scapegoat for failures in the modern livestock industry. The badger cull has failed on scientific, humaneness and cost grounds. For Andrea Leadsom to extend the badger cull to seven new areas defies belief and is a national disgrace,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Chris Pitt, deputy director of campaigns at the League Against Cruel Sports, said: \u201cIt is ludicrous that given all the evidence collated over the last four years, the government plan to roll out their misguided badger cull even further. Killing badgers is not only disastrous for badgers, but it\u2019s also calamitous for cattle and a dead end for farmers, because all the unbiased scientific opinion suggests that we\u2019ll never get rid of bovine TB this way.\u201d<br></p> <p>Claire Bass, executive director of the Human Society International UK, said: \u201cIt is both shocking and sad that the government is expanding this cruel \u2018pilot\u2019 policy to three new counties.\u201d</p> <p>The cost to taxpayers for the cull, described as \u201cindustry-led\u201d by the government, was <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/bovine-tb-government-badger-control-costs-2015\">\u00a317.6m for the three years from 2013 to 2015</a>, including \u00a36.7m on policing and \u00a36.6m on independent monitoring of effectiveness and humaneness. The lmonitoring, which found the first year of culls <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/feb/28/badger-cull-humaneness-test-tb-cattle\">were not effective or humane</a>, has been discontinued. The expenditure is equivalent to many thousands of pounds for each badger killed.</p> <p>The government funding needed for each new culling area is estimated at \u00a31.2m a year, meaning the seven news areas will cost a total of \u00a333.6m in total over the planned four years of culling. </p> <p>The government\u2019s original value-for-money assessment of the badger culls showed they would cost more than they saved in TB reduction. But a <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/548748/badger-control-policy-value-for-money-160824.pdf\">new assessment from the government</a> finds that the benefit of future culls will exceed the costs, due to \u201cto more cost-effective monitoring and policing\u201d.</p> <p>The government expects policing costs to \u201cdisappear\u201d over time, \u201cfollowing further successful badger control operations without security incident\u201d, but protesters say they intend to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/23/badger-cull-protesters-change-tactics-in-response-to-expansion\">take direct action to drive up policing costs</a>.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/05/bovine-tb-not-passed-on-through-direct-contact-with-badgers-research-shows\">Recent research</a> showed that bovine TB is not passed through direct contact between badgers and cattle, but through contaminated pasture and dung.</p>",

Being a care worker is an increasingly skilled job, requiring staff who can provide highly intimate personal care as well as support with medication. It is not for the faint-hearted and requires talent, dedication and strength. It is no surprise then that there is a national shortage of care staff. In the last 12 months alone, a lack of homecare capacity in the community has caused delayed discharges from hospitals to increase by 40%.</p> <p>At a time when the NHS is creaking at the seams, there is an inherent short-sightedness in a system that focuses on cutting support for individuals, reducing call lengths and keeping charge rates for providers below sustainable levels. </p> <p>Unfortunately, many care providers still choose to accept very low charge rates from councils. This could be due to a lack of understanding of the minimum wage law, but is often simply caused by local businesses feeling they have no choice but to accept the terms offered, or risk going under. These businesses are often small and rely on a single contract just to exist.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Care staff should command the same respect as doctors and nurses, and a career in care should be rewarded appropriately</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I have huge sympathy for councils on this issue, especially as many have been forced to cut other services to protect social care budgets. However, there is no excuse for setting charge rates that will almost certainly lead to breaches of the minimum wage or poor service. The last few governments have talked about reconsidering how we, as a society, fund social care \u2013 but nothing material has happened. Ultimately, this means we are failing to examine how we want to look after older and vulnerable people who need our support. All demographics point to an increasingly elderly population over the next 10 to 20 years, many of whom will be living with multiple long-term conditions. Surely it is a measure of a good society that we provide proper care for those people, at a time when they need it most?</p> <p>If we had given even 1% of the time spent discussing Brexit on trying to reach a solution to the social care crisis, we might have one by now. </p> <p>Real integration of health and social care is important, but it is a long way off in most parts of the UK. In those places where it has been achieved, it is not all plain sailing. Our first priority should be ensuring that the care system is sustainable. </p> <p>We must move away from a system that pays the provider for the minutes spent with a service user, to one that rewards quality and the impact on that person\u2019s life. Having due regard for those we rely on to carry out that work is just as essential; care staff should command the same respect as doctors and nurses, and a career in care should be rewarded appropriately.</p> <p>There are councils, such as Torbay and Wiltshire, that are moving to fundamentally different ways of working that are positive and take these factors into account. At Mears, we are doing everything we can to support positive changes to working practices, better conditions for the workforce and greater focus on the service user.

In a press release, it suggested that menopausal hormonal treatment was being underprescribed, and GPs needed to prescribe it more. \u201cFor the last decade, some GPs have been worried about prescribing HRT, and women worried about taking it \u2026\u201d it wrote. \u201cFor health professionals, the guideline should boost their confidence in prescribing HRT, having fully discussed the woman\u2019s individual circumstances with her.\u201d</p> <p>That seemed pretty clear, but now a new UK study apparently shows that the risks of breast cancer have been underestimated and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/aug/23/combined-hrt-increases-breast-cancer-risk-nearly-300\" title=\"\">\u201cnearly tripled\u201d</a> when women were taking hormone treatment for menopause.</p> <p>So should I still feel confident about prescribing it? Is this a high or a low risk? Is it a risk worth taking? Well, that depends on the patient. There will be women who regard the risks as reasonable because they experience such enormous benefits. Then there are other women who would consider a much smaller risk of serious harm unacceptable. Autonomy rules, and there is no \u201ccorrect\u201d answer (although I suspect the <a href=\"http://www.gmc-uk.org/\" title=\"\">General Medical Council</a> would be quick to hold doctors to account for what was viewed as reckless prescribing). But to make that autonomy meaningful, we have to be able to make a rational, informed choice. That needs quality data. <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/bjc/journal/v115/n5/full/bjc2016231a.html\" title=\"\">So what does the latest study tell us?</a></p> <p>It\u2019s a prospective, cohort study, which specifically looked for hormone use and age at menopause, which many other studies have not. Just over 39,000 women had their age at menopause documented, and 775 of these developed breast cancer. They found that the women who used combination MHT were more likely to develop breast cancer by a factor of 2.7; this risk dissipated when the women stopped the MHT, but rose the longer it continued.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The NHS offers detailed decision aids for treatments for everything from arthritis to angina \u2013 but none on the menopause</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>We need to put this into context: 2.7 times a small number is still a small number, so you need to know <a href=\"https://preventbreastcancer.org.uk/about-breast-cancer/understanding-risk/\" title=\"\">what your risk was to start with</a>. For a woman aged between 50-70, the risk of breast cancer is about 5%. Is an increase to about 13% for the years a woman is taking the hormones worth it? I don\u2019t know. But I am also concerned as to whether this cohort are truly representative of the population at large, because the women who volunteered for this study were not asked to participate randomly, but were recruited through newsletters sent out by a breast cancer charity. They may, therefore, have been more likely to have a family member with breast cancer, or share the same environmental risks as friends with breast cancer, and so faced a higher risk to start with.</p> <p>I also don\u2019t reliably know how much the change in breast cancer risk is per woman: as one of the authors, Dr Michael Jones, told me: \u201cOur results are internally consistent and we can talk about relative changes, but we cannot make external extrapolations in absolute risk to the whole UK.\u201d In other words, care is needed \u2013 and we will need this data to be replicated in other data sets before we can be confident that it applies equally to other women.</p> <p>Uncertainty is a hallmark of medical decision making. If a woman develops breast cancer while taking MHT, no one can be sure whether it would have happened in any case. We need context. We can\u2019t control our genes, but what other risk factors can we at least partially control? <a href=\"http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/health-professional/cancer-statistics/statistics-by-cancer-type/breast-cancer/risk-factors\" title=\"\">Cancer Research UK says that</a> 9% of breast cancers are linked to obesity, 6% to excess alcohol, and 3% to insufficient physical activity. In context, MHT <a href=\"http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/health-professional/cancer-statistics/statistics-by-cancer-type/breast-cancer/risk-factors#heading-Fourteen\" title=\"\">is linked to 3% of all breast cancers</a>. If this has been underestimated, as the new study claims, by up to 60%, that means that up to 5% of all breast cancers could be linked to MHT. But there are so many ongoing uncertainties that I think pinning it down to the last percentage point makes this look more accurate than it is.</p> <p>So what do we do in the meantime? GPs are under enormous pressure anyway \u2013 each of our appointments is just 10-12 minutes long, with an average of <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24267858\" title=\"\">2.5 problems being discussed</a>, so there\u2019s barely time to make a safe diagnosis, never mind discuss most of the side effects for each possible treatment. There has been a quiet revolution in medicine in the last decade, a realisation that making choices is often hard to do well. There are now a wealth of \u201cshared decision aids\u201d online, based on high-quality evidence and with the emphasis on assisting patients, not dictating \u201cchoice\u201d. They work in different ways; some are online or DVD-based, and they usually try and lay out the pros and cons of treatments in a logical way, giving the person enough time and information to make high-quality decsions.</p> <p>These have been shown to help people make better decisions <a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD001431.pub4/full\" title=\"\">about treatment choices </a>\u2013 and using them before or after GP appointments is a useful way of making oneself surer of healthcare choices.</p> <p>The NHS has a website devoted to detailed decision aids for treatments for everything <a href=\"http://sdm.rightcare.nhs.uk/pda/\" title=\"\">from arthritis to angina</a> \u2013 but none, so far, on the menopause. Nice does have an information section on its website about the pros and cons of hormone treatment for menopause, <a href=\"https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng23/ifp/chapter/Benefits-and-risks-of-HRT\" title=\"\">but doesn\u2019t provide any numbers about the risks</a> \u2013 or define what they mean by \u201clow-risk\u201d, <a href=\"https://decisionaid.ohri.ca/azsumm.php?ID=1047\" title=\"\">in common with other US decision aids</a> \u2013 and while that might be enough information for some women, it\u2019s unlikely to be detailed enough for others.</p> <p>We need better quality information that doesn\u2019t offer more certainty than we actually have: we are in a new era of medicine, and honesty about the knowns and unknowns, and the limitations of our knowledge is essential. I will continue to prescribe MHT, but when it comes to discussing risks and benefits, I suspect I will be answering many questions with an honest \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d.</p>",

As one of the biggest covered public spaces in London, a bazaar-like atmosphere prevailed inside, with lawyers tossing coins in the baptismal font, farmers\u2019 wives selling fruit and ale, and apprentices shooting arrows at the jackdaws and pigeons in the rafters, smashing the holy windows. Riding high in the eastern wall was the famous rose window, bathing the high altar in kaleidoscopic light.</p> <p>When St Paul\u2019s burned down on the third day of the fire, a local thunderstorm broke out with forks of apocalyptic lightning radiating from the blazing building.

  "<p>The Australian government has sponsored a guide to undermine violent extremist narratives in south-east Asia that identifies Islamophobia and western military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan as \u201cpush\u201d factors to extremism.</p> <p>The guide proposes strategies to prevent radicalisation by undermining the factual and religious bases for calls to extremism.</p> <p>The Australian justice minister, Michael Keenan, announced <a href=\"http://www.hedayah.ae/pdf/cn-sea-guide.pdf\">the release of the guide</a> on Tuesday at the 14th annual national security summit in Canberra.</p> <p>Keenan, who is also the minister assisting the prime minister on counter-terrorism, confirmed the government would introduce a bill next month to establish <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/jul/25/malcolm-turnbull-urges-legislation-for-indefinite-detention-of-terrorists\">a scheme to keep high-risk terrorist offenders in jail indefinitely</a>.</p> <p>The counter-terrorism guide was produced by the Hedayah Institute, an independent, multilateral centre devoted to countering violent extremism.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jun/24/michael-keenans-accusations-of-anne-aly-are-an-outrageous-betrayal-of-his-role\">Michael Keenan's accusations of Anne Aly are an outrageous betrayal of his role | Lydia Shelly</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It suggests people are radicalised when they are convinced there are injustices to which violence is the only effective response.</p> <p>The guide notes a number of socioeconomic factors and grievances of extremists in south-east Asia, including poverty, hate speech, Islamophobia, feelings of victimhood related to suffering of Muslims outside the region, lack of education and \u201cmilitary operations by Western governments in Afghanistan and Iraq\u201d.</p> <p>Pull factors for terrorism are more individual and emotional, it says, and include ideas of achieving a \u201cpure Islam\u201d, a sense of adventure and \u201cidealisation of former fighters from Afghanistan and other conflicts\u201d.</p> <p>The guide suggests using religious texts and leaders to refute the claims of Islamic extremists. For example, scholars should reinforce the concept of jihad as an internal struggle, not a physical or violent one, and emphasise that Islam is inclusive of all ethnicities.</p> <p>Particular weaknesses in extremist ideology include the number of Sunni Muslims the organisation kills and the hypocrisy of its violence, the guide says.</p> <p>Other strategies include rebutting factually incorrect claims and even \u201cpoking fun at [extremists\u2019] objectives, aims, tactics or beliefs\u201d.</p> <p>The guide recommends identifying the best messenger to counter radicalisation.</p> <p>Former terrorists and fighters have the \u201cstreet credibility\u201d to effectively contradict the emotional or psychological appeal of extremism, the guide says. It cited an <a href=\"http://m.news.viva.co.id/video/read/40891-inipengakuan-anggota-isis-selama-di-suriah \">interview with a former Isis member from Indonesia</a>, which it said demonstrated the corruption within the group.</p> <p>The families of potential extremists are highly persuasive, as are victims and survivors including mothers of violent extremists or mothers of victims of terrorism, it says.</p> <p>The guide warns that individuals may travel to Iraq and Syria to join groups such as Isis and al-Qaida and return to carry out attacks in south-east Asia, or may conduct lone wolf attacks locally.</p> <p>Keenan said at least 500 people, and possibly more than 800, had travelled from south-east Asian countries to fight in Syria and Iraq.</p> <p>He said the guide was sponsored and supported by the Australian government and was a first of its kind for the south-east Asian region.</p> <p>Keenan warned that since the declaration of the Islamic State \u201ccaliphate\u201d in June 2014, terrorist attacks had spiked worldwide.</p> <p>\u201cIn the last two years alone, we have seen three attacks and 10 major disruption operations in relation to imminent attack planning in Australia. This compares to no attacks and four disruptions in the preceding decade.\u201d</p> <p>Keenan said Australia\u2019s counter-terrorism approach was pre-emptive because \u201cpreventing a terrorist incident and saving lives must have precedence over gathering the evidence necessary for a prosecution\u201d.</p> <p>He said the government would introduce two bills, including the preventive detention bill, as part of the \u201cconstant review\u201d to ensure agencies had powers to deal with terrorist threats.</p> <p>Keenan described radicalisation to the point of violence as \u201can incredibly complex issue\u201d. </p> <p>\u201cTerrorist propaganda affects each individual\u2019s state of mind, their thoughts and emotions differently. There is no single pathway to radicalisation.\u201d</p> <p>He said the government had \u201cdeveloped intervention programs to help those on the wrong path before security or law enforcement responses are needed\u201d.</p> <p>Keenan said the guide provided guidance for governments and civil society organisations to support development of effective counter-narratives that undercut the appeal of terrorist propaganda.</p>",

The 45th parliament was opened by the governor general, Peter Cosgrove.

Labor has yet to give a final decision on whether to support the $6.1bn in savings as it was only handed over in the last 24 hours and it is 650 pages. <br></strong></li> <li><strong>Labor has asked Turnbull to join with them and reaffirm the parliament\u2019s commitment to non-discrimination in immigration and Indigenous affairs. With an eye to Cory Bernardi\u2019s push to change 18c of the Racial Discrimination Act and Pauline Hanson\u2019s policies on Islam, Labor is trying to draw Turnbull out on equality.

How great is it to have Politics Live back? To some breaking news. For the last week or so, I\u2019ve been watching developments inside the Coalition on the Racial Discrimination Act closely. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/29/conservatives-flex-muscle-over-marriage-equality-and-18c\">In a story I published last night</a>, I noted the Liberal senator <strong>Cory Bernardi</strong> had been seen stalking the corridors yesterday collecting signatures for his private member\u2019s bill, which aims to remove the words \u201cinsult\u201d and \u201coffend\u201d from the RDA.<br><br>His effort seems to be progressing well. The bush mail inside the Coalition informs me <strong>he\u2019s signed up every backbencher in the upper house in the Liberal and National parties with the exception of Jane Hume, a new Liberal from Victoria</strong>. The bill now could have support from as many as 20 senators, if we throw in the crossbench. That\u2019s obviously a sizeable minority of senators, a minority that will be pretty hard for the prime minister to ignore, which is presumably why <strong>Malcolm Turnbull</strong> has recently switched his line from no, we are not overhauling the RDA, to we are not overhauling the RDA \u201cyet.\u201d Bernardi won\u2019t confirm he has 20 but he\u2019s told me he\u2019s \u201cheartened by the level of support I\u2019ve received\u201d.</p> <p>Back to you Gabrielle Chan.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-08-29T23:49:07.251Z\">at 12.49am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57c4c4b4e4b0655f72768985\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-29T23:27:59.850Z\">12.27am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Bill Shorten</strong> thanked <strong>Tina Brown</strong> and the <strong>Wedgetails</strong> for the welcome to country.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Australians most certainly want this 45th parliament to be capable of rising above self-seeking, narrow sectional interests.

They join <strong>Tina Brown\u2019s</strong> ancestors, leaders who have used this land as a meeting place for thousands of years, who would welcome surrounding clans here for ceremonies and celebrations, for marriages, to discuss matters of cultural and economic importance and to trade.

We have a politically and religiously ecumenical service to start attended by <strong>Malcolm Turnbull, Bill Shorten </strong>and<strong> Barnaby Joyce</strong>, followed by the swearing in. </p> <p>The governor general Sir <strong>Peter Cosgrove</strong> will make a speech, Speaker <strong>Tony Smith</strong> will be ceremonially dragged to his chair and then the formal business will be underway.</p> <p>The real business, of course, is already well underway. Yesterday was dominated by two very long party room meetings. The Coalition and Labor have pretty well got all their committee positions sorted and already, outliers are organising their various sorties to cut across the more organised agendas. Think 18c, think marriage equality. </p> <p>The Coalition\u2019s business is the budget omnibus bill, now fully briefed out to the Coalition backbenchers, Labor and some senators. This was the bill that raps all the government\u2019s budget savings into one, including the measures that Labor included in its pre-election savings. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/29/conservatives-flex-muscle-over-marriage-equality-and-18c\">Murpharoo has fleshed it out here.</a></p> <p>Post-election, Labor has resisted agreeing to the bill until they saw the fine print. Labor\u2019s manager of opposition business, <strong>Tony Burke</strong>, this morning has said, well lucky we did! One more measure has been added and the final savings total has changed.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The government has lied about the contents of this bill ... the bill that has now emerged is different to what the government has said it would be.</p> </blockquote> <p>I shall have the Newspoll results for you in a moment. Shorter version \u2013 parties remain neck and neck, Turnbull\u2019s support continues to drop. </p> <p>So let\u2019s get on with it.

If you want to get ahead in the military, it helps to do your best in your exams while you\u2019re at school, Chadwick says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"60fe7d5a38875fd57579b5410ecd5b4f8366f5e3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/60fe7d5a38875fd57579b5410ecd5b4f8366f5e3/362_97_2291_2291/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Colonel Simon Stockley\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Colonel Simon Stockley: \u2018It\u2019s about engaging with society and them better understanding us.

Classmate Libby Douglas-Tomsett says her eyes have been opened to the career possibilities: \u201cI didn\u2019t know they had all those different jobs. I thought it was just going to war.\u201d</p> <p>But \u201cgoing to war\u201d is often part of a military career \u2013 and that prompts controversy about whether schools are being used as recruiting grounds. Applications are accepted age 15 and a half, and military training can start at 16, either at Harrogate Army Foundation college, or Welbeck Defence sixth-form college.</p> <p>The UK is the only EU country to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/video/2013/oct/28/british-army-young-recruit-video\">permit 16-year-olds to enlist</a> and start military training. According to Child Soldiers International (CSI), only 17 other countries allow it, including Zambia, El Salvador and Iran. In June, the UN committee on the rights of the child <a href=\"http://tbinternet.ohchr.org/_layouts/treatybodyexternal/Download.aspx?symbolno=CRC%2fC%2fGBR%2fCO%2f5&amp;Lang=en\">told the UK government</a> to \u201creconsider its active policy of recruitment of children into the armed forces and ensure that recruitment practices do not actively target persons under the age of 18 and ensure that military recruiters\u2019 access to schools be strictly limited\u201d.</p> <p>And an <a href=\"http://www.child-soldiers.org/news/open-letter-to-the-ministry-of-defence\">open letter</a> sent in May to the then armed forces minister, Penny Mordaunt, signed by children\u2019s and human rights organisations, teaching unions and the Welsh, Scottish and Northern Irish children\u2019s commissioners (though not the children\u2019s commissioner for England) pointed out that three-quarters of the British public would like to see all-adult armed forces. Most states worldwide, the letter states, enlist into the armed forces only from the age of 18.</p> <p>The military says it goes into schools only when invited, its sessions are agreed in advance and its activities in the classroom are not about recruitment. \u201cIt\u2019s about engaging with society and society better understanding us. It\u2019s about us having a relationship with the society we represent,\u201d says Colonel Simon Stockley, whose role as head of army recruitment encompasses schools and community outreach.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s been so much in the media over the past years in terms of what the army does in places like Afghanistan, and yet our job is also to show that the army\u2019s role goes much further. There is so much more to service than just combat.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2015/jan/22/veterans-military-ethos-schools\">Veterans bring \u2018military ethos\u2019 to schools</a> </p> </aside>  <p>At <a href=\"http://forceswatch.net/about\">ForcesWatch</a>, which monitors the military\u2019s presence in schools, coordinator Emma Sangster is sceptical. \u201cRecruitment is a process, it\u2019s not a single event,\u201d she says. Over time, these visits market a lifestyle of opportunity and thrills, and \u201cdrip feed things of interest to children of school age\u201d.</p> <p>This seems to be backed up by the military\u2019s own materials. A 2011 report, in a section titled Overview of Current Defence Youth Activity, states that \u201cservicemen and women engage young people in schools through presentations, discussions, problem solving and personal development activity \u2026 This engagement is primarily focused on recruitment, and each service also runs short military familiarisation courses to introduce selected young people to service life.\u201d</p> <p>In a table in the same document, \u201cdevelopment activity in schools\u201d is directly linked to recruitment outcomes. \u201cThis \u2018taster\u2019 activity is a more sensitive way of introducing service life and encouraging a predisposition to serve,\u201d it says.</p> <p>ForcesWatch has particular concerns regarding the careers materials and video presentations shown to pupils. \u201cThey sanitise what conflict involves, and also glamorise it. They focus on adventure, which young people are desperate for,\u201d says Sangster.</p> <p>A new video presentation, not shown to the Marlborough pupils on the day I visit, but which I watch in the library later, confirms her point. The overwhelming impression is of a fast-paced, thrilling lifestyle filled with skiing, skydiving, kayaking, rock-climbing and scuba diving, and it shows groups of off-duty soldiers socialising on a posting to Cyprus. Interspersed with the action-packed footage of young people having a blast is a whiz through different roles in the army, an occasional glimpse of tanks racing over rugged terrain and the odd gun barrel shooting a round into a clear blue sky. It looks like an advert for the best adventure holiday ever, with an added frisson provided by the hardware.</p> <p>And, says Rachel Taylor, programme manager at CSI, the risks children bear in the forces may be greater than if they were to enlist later. A <a href=\"http://www.child-soldiers.org/Shop/young-age-at-army-enlistment-is-associated-with-greater-war-zone-risks\">study</a> by CSI and ForcesWatch showed that those who joined at 16 were twice as likely to be killed in Afghanistan as those who joined at 18 or older \u2013 despite not being deployed until age 18.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4c0186f096f7f5a075518c0ee81061c7f702e0ed\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4c0186f096f7f5a075518c0ee81061c7f702e0ed/0_268_5000_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Female Muslim pupils next to a sign that says Army be the Best\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Marlborough Science Academy pupils next to an army promotion poster.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Levene/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThis is because they\u2019re channelled into the most dangerous roles when they\u2019re recruited,\u201d says Taylor. \u201cSo, although the Ministry of Defence always says \u2018it\u2019s not dangerous to join at 16 because you aren\u2019t deployed until you\u2019re 18\u2019, our response is \u2018it\u2019s your age when you enlist that determines the degree of risk you face over your whole career\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>At the Association of School and College Leaders, director of policy Leora Cruddas says: \u201cWe would not expect visits from the armed forces for recruitment purposes.\u201d</p> <p>Annie Thomson, headteacher at Marlborough science academy, has never felt that the military\u2019s sessions at her school pushed a recruitment message. They are invited in, along with representatives from other sectors, she says, \u201cto open up students to the idea that there is a whole range of ways to go forward\u201d.</p> <p>Issues relating to conflict are examined in a cross-curricular philosophy and ethics programme, she says. There is a cadet force at the school, and Thomson is keen for children to explore their prospects beyond a narrowly academic framework.</p> <p>\u201cIf we had a group of students who were interested in pursuing a route with the army, we\u2019d support them through that process,\u201d she says. There have been, she says, \u201cquite a few\u201d already.</p> <p>Young people in the armed forces can benefit from career training opportunities they might be pressed to find elsewhere, Stockley says. They are \u201coften young people who, for whatever reason, have not succeeded in traditional education, and [by joining up] they have transformed their lives\u201d, he says.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/shortcuts/2013/apr/23/british-armed-forces-16-year-olds\">Why do the British armed forces still allow 16-year-olds to enlist?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But there is an ethical question here, says Sangster, if the military is targeting schools in poorer areas, where children may have less good educational outcomes. \u201cIs it acceptable that students from those areas, who\u2019ve not been served well by the education system, should be targeted for a uniquely risky career?\u201d she asks. There is also a military exemption on minimum standards for training, she notes, which means that children who join up at 16 spend two years in college without any guarantees on the quality of their academic or vocational learning experience.</p> <p>There are moves to examine more carefully the messages given out by the military in educational settings. The Welsh government recently agreed to recommendations for more scrutiny and guidance of armed forces visits to schools, and the Scottish government is considering similar proposals. The Educational Institute for Scotland, the largest teaching union in Scotland, opposes unfettered access to schools by the military for recruitment purposes and the National Union of Teachers in England and Wales is opposed to military recruitment activities in schools that use \u201cmisleading propaganda\u201d.</p> <p>The military has enjoyed high visibility in schools in recent years, with millions of pounds spent on expanding the cadets, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2014/aug/05/troops-to-teachers-not-putting-ex-soldiers-in-classrooms\">Troops to Teachers initiative</a>, and a <a href=\"http://www.army.mod.uk/documents/general/British_Armed_Forces_Learning_Resource_2014_compressed.pdf\">teaching resource [pdf]</a> about the military promoted by the Department for Education that sparked criticism from the <a href=\"http://schoolsweek.co.uk/teaching-resource-asks-pupils-to-devise-a-plan-for-war/\">Quakers,</a> among others.</p> <p>Back at Marlborough science academy, there\u2019s no doubting that pupils have enjoyed their session with the army. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot about leadership, and yes, it\u2019s something I\u2019d want to do when I\u2019m older,\u201d says Ky Hussain, 14. Standing beside him, Libby says what struck her most is the community and friendship that life in the army fosters. \u201cI liked that,\u201d she says.</p> <p>\u201cI would go for it,\u201d says Lillie, \u201cbut at the same time, I\u2019d have to think about it because I\u2019d be scared.\u201d</p> <p><em>This article was amended on 30 August.

Once outside the EU, don\u2019t expect welfare, wages and working conditions to be high among their priorities as they attempt to strike new trade deals. Indeed, the risk is that after Brexit shipping companies based in the UK will try to drop existing EU regulations. Others may leave because they need an EU base: Stena Line warned immediately after the referendum that it might <a href=\"http://www.maritime-executive.com/article/stena-line-may-reflag-uk-vessels-following-brexit\">re-flag its UK vessels</a>.</p> <p>A manning directive to ensure that ships sailing between EU states are paid and regulated under EU law has failed to gain approval in Brussels for years, defeated by ship owners wanting to hire cheaper non-EU crews.</p> <p>Compare this with how the US protects its industry: all ships working between US ports must be US-built and crewed. Many countries do likewise. But in Britain and the EU it\u2019s a global free-for-all, where the cheapest contract wins. The result is a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2005/jan/16/theobserver.observerbusiness20\">collapse in the British-registered shipping industry</a>, now only 0.8% of the total worldwide. Why would owners pay British wages when they can hire crews elsewhere for much less?</p> <p>There has been a steep drop in training British mariners: companies are obliged to train some cadets, but then rarely take them on. More than 10 keen, well-qualified young people apply for every merchant navy training place; but despite promising good apprenticeships, the government has just cut funding for maritime training. <a href=\"http://worldmaritimenews.com/archives/194643/govt-asked-to-increase-funds-for-uk-maritime-workforce/\">Numbers are falling fast</a>, though thousands of experienced officers are needed onshore as harbourmasters and marine pilots.</p> <p>The City employs 15,000 of these trained officers in marine insurance, who arbitrate in causes of accidents and other shipping specialisms.

Meanwhile the government turns a blind eye.</p> <p>The sea has ebbed in the national consciousness, though it matters as much as ever to an island. Its romance still draws keen recruits, but it\u2019s a dangerous workplace, with climate change causing more violent storms. Britain depends for everything on this buccaneering industry, yet wages are undercut and jobs lost through aggressive globalisation. As with the equally essential <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/02/industrial-failure-uk-lorry-trade-truck-driver-squalor-low-pay-no-unions\">road transport industry</a>, the state steps back where it should step up.</p> <p>Two days ago Malaviya Twenty\u2019s owners paid off some of the crew, who are flying home \u2013 though the ship will be detained until all wages are fully paid. And as the Nautilus union protests: \u201cThe exploitation of these crews directly undermines our own shipping industry with unfair competition.\u201d</p> <p>British politics focuses too little on the reality of working lives. Many who voted Brexit overestimated the impact of migration on their own low pay, or the lack of housing and public services. But here\u2019s a case of crude, obvious labour-market abuse by employers substituting cheaper foreign staff.</p> <p>If one company does it and undercuts the rest, then all must follow suit in bidding for contracts. Only government intervention can prevent a race to the bottom that is eroding established working rights in so many sectors.</p>",

Wonka would taunt, he would tease, he would enslave indigenous peoples \u2013 he would, apparently, literally murder anyone he felt like \u2013 but he would not demand that those he subjugated ape him for his own distraction.

The columnists and studio guests should come here for a day, and see what their talking points look like as lived experience. Industrial decline? The once great shipbuilder Cammell Laird still clings on, but many of the other big employers have been wiped out. Insecure work?

Here, the horizons have shrunk so far that the neighbourhood can seem like a trap.</p> <p>Community feeling? It withers in this environment. Wendy remembers a welcome message when she moved in: \u201cMy neighbour knocked 11 o\u2019clock at night, drunk.

Because Wilkes and Doherty are doing something harder, rarer and perhaps more valuable than dispensing charity: they\u2019ve begun restoring a sense of pride to a community left for dead by the rest of the country.</p> <p>Take the centre the pair work out of. Once used by the council, it had long fallen into disrepair. Weeds thrust knee-high out of the paving and the paint on the railings was peeling. On opening day the gates were flung open, a bouncy castle was put up in the garden and some food was served up. The women, who are from neighbouring Wallasey, didn\u2019t know what to expect. Then by the end of the first morning, the garden began to overflow with stuff: footballs, a racket ball set, climbing kit.</p> <p>Neighbours who wouldn\u2019t even say hello to each other were bringing over their kids\u2019 playthings. When removal men brought over the giant M&amp;S chiller cabinets for the social supermarket but left them outside, muttering about the wrong angles, it was the locals who stood guard against any nicking \u2013 and then shifted them inside.</p> <p>When I visited, the grass was cut to less than an inch high, and the railings were freshly painted: all done by locals for free. The entire place is run on a philosophy of someone-will-know-someone. When I looked around, there were tyres cut in half to serve as planters, kit donated by schools, cafe tables and chairs given by a local Tesco. In an economy in which so many institutions have withered away or been useless, Wilkes and Doherty have led residents into building their own. Now volunteers lay on ukulele and art lessons upstairs for the kids, and the adults teach each other how to cook good-value filling meals. Local businesses have been corralled into donating money or goods or time. Next month, a solicitor will begin a free advice surgery.

He \u2013 or, less often, she \u2013 is an elected local official who counts heads, settles feuds, and finds cats.</p> <p>On the night of 15 July, Can Cumurcu, the <em>muhtar</em> of the affluent neighbourhood of \u00c7engelk\u00f6y, on the Asian shore of Istanbul, led the defence of his manor against soldiers who had joined a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/18/military-coup-was-well-planned-and-very-nearly-succeeded-say-turkish-officials\">military coup</a> to topple President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan. \u00c7engelk\u00f6y was the scene of a thrilling people\u2019s defence against the rebels. Cumurcu was shot just above the hip; now he\u2019s reckoned a <em>gazi</em>, or holy warrior.</p> <p>When I met him a couple of weeks after the coup failed, Cumurcu was propped up on the sofa in his flat in \u00c7engelk\u00f6y. His amiable face darkened when he mentioned his dead nephew, who had been cut down by army bullets during the coup \u2013 but the resolve in his voice, and his references to the \u201cesteemed\u201d president, the \u201csacred\u201d national flag, and God, made it clear that he felt that he had done his duty as a Turk and a Muslim.</p> <p>\u201cI got home at around 10pm that night,\u201d he remembered, wincing from his sore side, \u201cand my neighbours told me there were tanks on the Bosphorus Bridge.\u201d Cumurcu went down to the coastal road, where people were discussing the announcement on TV that the army had taken over the country. Then he saw an army captain entering \u00c7engelk\u00f6y on foot, firing his gun into the air.</p> <p>\u201cThe captain saw me and said, \u2018get these people inside!\u2019 I said sharply, \u2018Have you been drinking? Are you all right in the head?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>The captain retreated but Cumurcu guessed he would come back with reinforcements to clear the road. The <em>muhtar</em> arranged for a barricade of vehicles to be formed, and more locals were roused using social media. Some were armed; so were the handful of pro-Erdo\u011fan duty officers at \u00c7engelk\u00f6y\u2019s small police station. Shortly after midnight, the soldiers stormed back into the neighbourhood with a burst of automatic fire.

According to media reports, one officer shouted, \u201cYou dogs! Don\u2019t you know there\u2019s only one God? Your God is Erdo\u011fan. Let him come and save you now.\u201d</p> <p>All the accounts of the coup \u2013 even allowing for the fact that they have since been tidied into a seamless epic \u2013 agree that the president did indeed have a decisive effect on events. Erdo\u011fan had been holidaying in the southern resort of Marmaris; he was still there at 24 minutes past midnight, when he issued a televised appeal for Turks to come into the streets and defend the regime, for, as he put it, \u201cI\u2019ve yet to see a force stronger than the people.\u201d</p> <p>The number of civilians resisting the soldiers in \u00c7engelk\u00f6y suddenly leaped from a few score to thousands, a pattern replicated outside the Istanbul mayoralty, the Ankara parliament, and other flashpoints across the country. When Erdo\u011fan\u2019s plane landed at Istanbul airport at around 3am, he was met by huge crowds of supporters; three hours later, when news arrived that the Bosphorus Bridge had been liberated, the soldiers in \u00c7engelk\u00f6y turned tail. The coup was over.</p> <p>For the next few days, following the example of the loyalist media, the people of Turkey doused themselves in anger, pride, grief and exhilaration.

Not all of those who have been targeted appear to be connected to the movement led by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/16/fethullah-gulen-who-is-the-man-blamed-by-turkeys-president-for-coup-attempt\">Fethullah G\u00fclen</a>, the influential US-based preacher and educationalist whom Erdo\u011fan has accused of masterminding the coup. Scores of journalists have been detained, and around 100 media outlets have been forcibly shut down. Amnesty International has raised the possibility of <a href=\"https://www.amnesty.ie/latest/stories/2016/07/28/turkey-taking-big-step-backwards-human-rights/\">\u201cmass repression, torture and arbitrary detention\u201d</a> under the cover of the state of emergency that Erdo\u011fan declared on 20 July.</p> <p>For onlookers in the west, Erdo\u011fan\u2019s clampdown confirms his well-established tendency to regard his own popularity as a mandate to crush opponents. The spontaneous civilian uprising against the military coup may have represented the ultimate affirmation of the popular will \u2013 but the events that followed have deepened the contradiction between Erdo\u011fan\u2019s unquestionable democratic legitimacy and his equally indisputable authoritarian rule.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Erdogan\u2019s demokrasi may be \u201cilliberal\u201d in its practice, but it represents a forceful expression of the people\u2019s will</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The immediate reaction to the coup from American and European politicians provided evidence of their unease: both John Kerry, the US secretary of state, and Federica Mogherini, the EU\u2019s foreign policy chief, issued warnings to the Turks demanding that Erdo\u011fan <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/18/european-leaders-urge-turkey-to-respect-rule-of-law-after-failed-coup\">respect democracy and the rule of law</a>. The clear implication, for listeners inside Turkey, was that Europe and America were more concerned for the thugs who had tried to seize the state than they were for its democratically elected leaders. In response, Erdo\u011fan excoriated the west for \u201csiding with the putchists\u201d.</p> <p>Words often change meaning when they change language. If Erdo\u011fan is correct to suspect that the US and EU would not have mourned his overthrow, this is because he now presides over a bespoke form of government that western leaders do not understand or appreciate. Erdogan\u2019s <em>demokrasi</em> may be \u201cilliberal\u201d in its practice, but it represents a forceful expression of the people\u2019s will \u2013 a blunt majoritarian riposte to an imagined democratic gold standard that in reality no longer exists.</p> <p>Turkey under Erdo\u011fan may be compared with Putin\u2019s Russia, Modi\u2019s India and Netanyahu\u2019s Israel. In all these places the forms of democracy have been suborned by majoritarian nationalism, bolstered to varying degrees by the security state. In fact, Erdo\u011fan\u2019s programme does not look very different to the prospectus unveiled by France\u2019s would-be strongman, Nicolas Sarkozy, whose campaign for the presidency looks likely to be defined by his promises to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/22/nicolas-sarkozy-declares-candidacy-french-presidential-election\">enforce majority prejudice over minority interests</a>. (His support for the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/26/frances-highest-court-suspends-burkini-ban-in-test-case\">burkini ban</a> is a case in point.) Of course, Erdo\u011fan is an Islamist \u2013 while the others are anti-Islamists. But the new wave of elected authoritarians are nothing if not indulgent of many different varieties of nationalist phobia.</p> <p>From this perspective, Erdo\u011fan is less an aberration than the vanguard of a global trend: the dissolution of the supposedly universal democratic ideal into many indigenised \u201cversions\u201d of democracy. What makes Kerry and Mogherini\u2019s lectures even harder for Erdo\u011fan to stomach is that Europe and America are hardly exceptions to this tendency. Under the state of emergency that France\u2019s government introduced after last November\u2019s terrorist attacks, the rights of French citizens to freedom of movement and association have been formally suspended. (Turkey\u2019s government did the same following the coup.) Xenophobia has once more become a widely accepted electoral tool: consider the loud and deceitful warnings of leading Brexit campaigners that Britain would soon be swamped by millions of Turkish migrants if the UK remained inside the EU. As for the paternalistic American pluralism preached by John Kerry, this could soon be washed away by a demagogue whose conception of democracy consists of a soapbox and a baseball bat.</p> <p>It is unsurprising that Erdo\u011fan views the west\u2019s stated concern for democracy as nothing but a cynical tool of foreign policy: after all, these same countries mutely acquiesced in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/04/egypt-revolution-coup-military-intervention-analysis\">military overthrow</a> of his friend Mohamed Morsi, the democratically elected Muslim Brotherhood president of Egypt, only three years ago.</p> <p>For all Erdo\u011fan\u2019s democratic shortcomings, furthermore, his country isn\u2019t a dictatorship and he isn\u2019t a fascist. Turkey\u2019s president has neither stolen elections nor launched pogroms against the country\u2019s minority Kurdish or Alevi communities. The awkward fact for Erdo\u011fan\u2019s critics is that his popularity has not been hurt by his authoritarianism; if anything, his legitimacy has been further enhanced. Two years after he ascended from the prime minister\u2019s office to the presidency, his electoral record is almost peerless: after leading his party to victory in one presidential election and five general elections, he is arguably the world\u2019s most successful democratic politician.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a4daf0c6352cd2f734cc7c96125da27bd9f4810e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a4daf0c6352cd2f734cc7c96125da27bd9f4810e/0_23_3480_2234/1000.jpg\" alt=\"President Erdo\u011fan chairs a cabinet meeting, sitting beneath a portrait of the Turkish republic\u2019s founder Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk,\" width=\"1000\" height=\"642\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">President Erdo\u011fan chairs a cabinet meeting, sitting beneath a portrait of the Turkish republic\u2019s founder Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: HANDOUT/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>* * *</h2> <p>During his 13 years in power, Erdo\u011fan and his Justice and Development party (AKP) have presided over a transformation in Turkey\u2019s fortunes: on the back of strong and stable leadership and a raft of liberalising political and economic reforms, Europe\u2019s basket case became a major economic power and a candidate for EU membership. The impetus for this transformation dates back to the 1980s and 1990s, when Turkish Islamists of Erdo\u011fan\u2019s generation were a numerical majority, and yet in political and social terms a repressed minority. The country\u2019s ruling establishment was exclusively peopled by secular-minded Kemalists, named after the founder of the Turkish republic, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2013/nov/08/ataturk-turkey-photography-ersoy-emin\">Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk</a>; the Kemalist army repeatedly intervened to prevent governments from reflecting the wishes of a mostly devout, intermittently anti-western electorate.</p> <p>Such was the Turkey I came to know after 1996, when I went to live in Ankara as the Economist\u2019s correspondent. Atat\u00fcrk and his successors had designed their new capital in the 1920s and 1930s to be a secular, republican contrast to Istanbul, the old imperial capital and former seat of the caliphate. Three-quarters of a century later, the Kemalist regime remained militaristic and unliberalised: one constantly saw staff officers being driven from one gaunt military building to another in ancient Turkish-made Fiats. Looking back from the big hill in the south of the city, with the Sheraton blocking your view of the only major mosque, it was possible to survey the capital of one of the world\u2019s biggest Muslim countries without seeing a single minaret.</p> <p>I was struck by the hatred with which the secular elite regarded their devout compatriots. \u201cReactionary\u201d and \u201cretarded\u201d were the kinder adjectives that bureaucrats, army officers and newspaper editors attached to members of banned Islamic brotherhoods or people who sent their children to religious schools. A physical revulsion seemed to come over my emancipated female friends at the rare sight of a woman wearing the long, black body covering known in Turkey as the <em>\u00e7ar\u015faf</em>; they called these women \u201ctwo-legged cockroaches\u201d. At night, the secularists drank raki toasts to their hero Atat\u00fcrk and chain-smoked Samsun cigarettes in a line of fish restaurants in the centre of town.</p> <p>Each day, in and out of the ministry buildings went clean-shaven men in ties and women in skirts. Beards or head coverings were banned for public servants, and the only scarf one saw was on the head of the tea lady. Even after Erdo\u011fan became prime minister, in 2003, the arch-Kemalist President Ahmet Necdet Sezer refused to invite the covered Mrs Erdo\u011fan to attend Republic Day celebrations; when a reporter asked what he felt about this, Erdo\u011fan replied, \u201cput yourselves in my wife\u2019s place and decide for yourself\u201d.</p> <p>The only time I had a strong impression of being in a Muslim city was while driving to Ankara airport, past slums that were home to migrants from rural Turkey. Here, the women were covered and the men bearded; spindly minarets rose like Anatolian poplars against the sky.</p> <p>Kemalism was a big institutional fantasy according to which Turkey was a kind of warm-water Sweden. In the troubled 1990s, the country\u2019s secular establishment was associated with economic instability (inflation averaged 70%), a pitiless war against the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 party (PKK), and a spiteful policy that banned girls in headscarves from public universities. Turkey\u2019s allies in Nato and the EU were alive to these failures; in a country whose politicians constantly solicited the affirmation of the west, the eventual rejection of Kemalism could only take place with outside approval.</p> <p>The big winner from the west\u2019s growing disenchantment with Kemalism was Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan \u2013 a ferry captain\u2019s son with roots in the conservative Black Sea region, who had served as a popular mayor of Istanbul since 1994. Rather than impose Islamic law on Turkey\u2019s most cosmopolitan city, as the secularists had predicted he would, Erdo\u011fan had devoted himself to improving the city\u2019s transport system, water supply, and air quality.</p> <p>When I met Erdo\u011fan in the spring of 1997, he was quick to point to the many ways in which Istanbullus\u2019 lives had got better since he became mayor. His account was hard to fault; even his secularist critics concurred that this sclerotic, corrupt old wreck of a place finally had a competent, hard-working mayor who wasn\u2019t on the take. We met on the terrace of an imperial Ottoman house that he had had restored and then opened to the public. The house itself was a symbol of his departure from the ruling order; the secularists were so disdainful of the defunct empire that they had let most of these relics crumble.</p> <p>Erdo\u011fan came out on to the terrace where I was sitting with one of his aides; he was athletic and youthful and looked good in a dark suit. We were brought superb early strawberries and ate them while admiring the Bosphorus view. He smiled often as we talked, without any of the glowering pompousness he now displays regularly \u2013 but even then, I sensed a wariness that was more than the usual politician\u2019s caution; he knew that the west was still making up its mind about him.</p> <p>He flashed one of his smiles when I reminded him of the Kemalists\u2019 criticism of his decision not to allow booze in this and other municipal establishments. \u201cWhen I became mayor they said I would ban alcohol in Istanbul, but anyone who wants to drink may do so.\u201d He seemed to be saying, \u201ctime will tell\u201d.</p> <p>The doubts that many in Turkey felt towards him concerned his intentions; the previous year he had caused outrage by describing democracy as a \u201ctram ... it goes as far as we want it to go, and then we get off\u201d. That evening I upset my Turkish friends by defending too fervently a man they continued to regard as a theocrat in disguise.</p> <p>The following year, Erdo\u011fan was sentenced to 10 months in jail on risible charges of inciting a religious insurrection (he ended up serving four). He had recited some lines of martial poetry by an early Turkish nationalist, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ziya_G%C3%B6kalp\">Ziya G\u00f6kalp</a>. The US consul in Istanbul came to the mayoralty to commiserate; the case, she said, would \u201cweaken confidence in Turkish democracy\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"91a14cc9676774c7038c8347debef08a76dbac1b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/91a14cc9676774c7038c8347debef08a76dbac1b/0_57_2048_1228/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Erdo\u011fan with his wife Emine in 1999, the day before he was sent to prison for inciting a religious insurrection\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Erdo\u011fan with his wife Emine in 1999, the day before he was sent to prison for inciting a religious insurrection.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Reuters Photographer / Reuter/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Four years after he was released from prison, Erdo\u011fan\u2019s rise to prime minister in 2003 was applauded not only by conservative Turks but also by western politicians and academics who hoped that his democratic Islamism would provide an alternative path to the \u201cclash of civilisations\u201d that many regarded as inevitable in the wake of 9/11. Erdo\u011fan was praised for his commitment to something called \u201cmoderate\u201d Islam, although he bridled at the term, as most Muslims would; Islam is a God-given truth and in no need of improving qualifiers. His domestic opponents continued to accuse him of hiding his true beliefs until he had purged Kemalist institutions like the army and the judiciary.</p> <p>In its first few years in power, Erdo\u011fan\u2019s AKP introduced a slew of liberalising and democratic reforms. The notorious state security courts were scrapped, torture was curtailed, and the government put out feelers aimed at a political settlement with the Kurds. Political stability and fiscal discipline helped to cut inflation, while in pious central Anatolia \u2013 the AKP\u2019s heartland \u2013 ambitious family-run firms invested in future growth. Between 2002 and 2013 the economy expanded by an average of 5% per annum: the government used the proceeds of that growth to invest in housing, health, and education. The slums I used to drive past on the road to Ankara airport in the 1990s were replaced with smart modern flats.</p> <p>The high water mark for Erdo\u011fan and the west was 2005, when the EU and Turkey opened accession negotiations. At the time, Erdo\u011fan expressed a worldview that was notably open and optimistic. \u201cCountries on their own,\u201d he said, \u201cdo not mean \u2026 much any more. They can achieve a lot more in solidarity with their friends.\u201d</p> <p>By making himself and Turkey indispensable to the west \u2013 there was, the veteran US diplomat Richard Holbrooke declared, \u201cno country in the world of more strategic importance\u201d \u2013 Erdo\u011fan was also protecting himself against his Kemalist foes. The wisdom of this approach was demonstrated in 2007, when the general staff threatened a coup if he went ahead with plans to elevate his AKP confrere Abdullah G\u00fcl to the presidency. Instead, the EU and the US weighed in with statements of support for the elected government, Erdo\u011fan called the generals\u2019 bluff by holding early elections which he resoundingly won, and G\u00fcl moved into the presidential palace \u2013 along with his covered wife.</p> <p>Erdo\u011fan was now strong enough to accelerate a process that had begun years earlier, changing the ethos of the army, which had earlier toppled three governments. Kemalist officers were retired, and Islamists brought in. In this endeavour, Erdo\u011fan was assisted by the followers of Fethullah G\u00fclen \u2013 the secretive Islamist movement that was allied with the AKP against the secular establishment for a decade until a dramatic split in 2013.</p> <p>It is likely that Erdo\u011fan\u2019s vulnerability in the early stages of his premiership made it easier for him to make friendly gestures to Kurds and liberals \u2013 constituencies well beyond the typical ambit of the Turkish Islamist. In 2004, a ban on teaching in the Kurdish language was lifted, and the prime minister repeatedly overruled plans by the military to attack PKK camps in northern Iraq; some Kurds, particularly the conscientious Muslim ones, rewarded him with their votes.</p> <p>Perhaps most surprising, in the mid-2000s Turkey gained the most vocal feminist, environmentalist and LGBT movements in the Muslim Middle East. The organisers of Istanbul\u2019s annual gay pride march called it the biggest in the Muslim world. (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/19/police-use-teargas-against-lgbt-activists-in-istanbul\">This year\u2019s march was banned</a> by the authorities in Istanbul, however, citing security concerns after nationalist groups warned they would not allow it to take place.) For a while \u2013 with the exception of Turkey\u2019s roughly 15 million Alevis, whom many in the Sunni mainstream regard as renegade Muslims \u2013 Erdo\u011fan could claim to be a leader for all Turkey.</p> <p>The tragedy of modern Turkey is that all of these relationships that had begun to blossom under Erdo\u011fan \u2013 with the Kurds, with Turkish liberals, with the EU and the US \u2013 have now fallen apart again under his leadership, which only becomes more authoritarian and isolated with the crumbling of each alliance.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"89c09e2f2480f7d5124effd0cb0143d54f0d8444\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/89c09e2f2480f7d5124effd0cb0143d54f0d8444/0_30_1993_1196/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Erdo\u011fan greets his Justice and Development party supporters in Istanbul, about a month after the party won the 2002 general election.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Erdo\u011fan greets his Justice and Development party supporters in Istanbul, about a month after the party won the 2002 general election.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murad Sezer/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Erdo\u011fan is a proud man, sensitive to slights. He turned decisively against his old friend Bashar al-Assad when the latter rejected Erdo\u011fan\u2019s appeal for leniency towards the Syrians who began protesting against the dictator in the spring of 2011. (It has also been reported that Mrs Assad made rude remarks about the Erdo\u011fans after the two couples holidayed together, which were intercepted by Turkish intelligence.)</p> <p>Turkey\u2019s support for Syrian opposition fighters reflected Erdo\u011fan\u2019s one-time hope that a Sunni-dominated Syria would become a loyal Turkish client. Instead, the Turks have seen an influx of millions of Syrian refugees, and watched helplessly while the Syrian Kurdish allies of the PKK, which Turkey designates as a terrorist organisation, have set up autonomous cantons across the border. When Turkey bowed to American pressure and joined the coalition against Islamic State in 2014, the jihadis responded with a string of suicide attacks inside Turkey \u2013 the most recent of which, in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/20/several-dead-in-suspected-terrorist-blast-at-wedding-in-turkey\">southern city of Gaziantep</a>, on 20 August, killed 50 people.</p> <p>In the summer of 2013, weeks of protests initially sparked by the government\u2019s plans to bulldoze an Istanbul park decisively snapped whatever understanding still remained between Erdo\u011fan and Turkish liberals, millions of whom came out to demonstrate against the AKP\u2019s growing authoritarianism. (As if to prove their point, the protests were harshly put down, injuring thousands.) Finally, last summer, amid the ruins of his Syria policy, Erdo\u011fan launched a new round of fighting against the PKK that has so far cost some 1,800 lives and devastated towns across Turkish Kurdistan.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Erdo\u011fan\u2019s capacity for umbrage knows no bounds: he has brought some 2,000 suits for defamation</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Turkey\u2019s unresolved application for EU membership has arguably been the most painful reverse of all. Even back in 2005, it was clear that there was a strong chance that Austria, France or Germany would block Turkey\u2019s membership because the country is too big and too Muslim. Since then, various pretexts have been found to slow the accession process to a crawl. It is now clear that Turkey will not join, but formally ending negotiations would cause yet more ill-will and jeopardise what cooperation there is, particularly on Syrian refugees.</p> <p>Erdo\u011fan is a bully who has insulted his political opponents and locked up critical journalists. His reflexive response to criticism is to demand, in public: \u201cWho do you think you are?\u201d (At the end of July, he directed this question at General Joseph Votel, the commander of American forces in the Middle East, who suggested that Erdo\u011fan\u2019s purge of military officers would damage the ongoing campaign against Islamic State.) Erdo\u011fan\u2019s capacity for umbrage knows no bounds: he has brought some 2,000 suits for defamation, including one against a German comic who recited a poem about him copulating with a goat.</p> <p>Even now, after 13 years of uninterrupted power and the accumulation of untold wealth, Turkey\u2019s ruling Islamists seem still to be responding to humiliations that were meted out to them by the superior, snobby, Europeanised Kemalists. Erdo\u011fan has not got where he is by taking fancy degrees or showing off his restaurant French (he is defiantly monolingual) \u2013 but through straightforward piety and political nous. Just as the Kemalists used to disparage the \u201cprimitive\u201d ways of Turkey\u2019s Islamists, so too does Erdo\u011fan deplore liberal freedoms that he regards as obstacles to development and virtue. He has compared abortions to mass murder and derides all drinkers as alcoholics; environmentalists, he has said, should move to a forest.</p> <p>During Erdo\u011fan\u2019s honeymoon with the west, foreign journalists used to remark that his rough edges had been smoothed in office; his trips abroad as prime minister, it was implied, had been the making of him. But these pats on the head reflected their wishes rather than his: in the contemptuous words of a Turkish opposition leader, Erdo\u011fan still had the style of a <em>maganda</em> \u2013 a boorish lout. (Erdo\u011fan promptly sued.)</p> <p>The liberals protesting against Erdo\u011fan in the summer of 2013 enjoyed mocking the monstrous <em>maganda</em> palace he was building for himself in Ankara \u2013 which ended up costing more than $600m and was built in brazen violation of a court ruling that it was illegal. Last October Erdo\u011fan castigated opposition leaders who dared to criticise the palace for trying to weaken a \u201cdemocratically-elected president\u201d. For Erdo\u011fan, what justifies his contempt for both the opposition and the law is the fact that he wins elections. In this view, the defeat of the attempted coup was the biggest election of all, and his most decisive victory. It was a huge and spontaneous plebiscite, and Turkey will probably never hear the end of it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"06f6129cc8adbc6419287b2a142ea46cf5898626\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/06f6129cc8adbc6419287b2a142ea46cf5898626/426_922_4081_2448/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Police and civilians celebrate the thwarting of the coup, on the Bosphorus bridge in Istanbul.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Police and civilians celebrate the thwarting of the coup, on the Bosphorus bridge in Istanbul.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Emrah Gurel/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>* * *</h2> <p>For the past few years \u2013 but especially in the past six weeks \u2013 Erdo\u011fan has redefined Turkish democracy to give himself a mandate to interpret and even anticipate the will of the majority while absolving himself of the responsibility to protect minorities.</p> <p>In his obvious aspiration to personify the nation, there is only one man who can rival him: Atat\u00fcrk. Until the final defeat of the Kemalist establishment in the late-2000s, Atat\u00fcrk was everywhere: his handsome features on the TV screens, his aphorisms emblazoned in bus stations, his name intoned in every speech. Erdo\u011fan now is as visible as Atat\u00fcrk was then \u2013 and equally protected from criticism. \u201cWith your elevated permission,\u201d the TV interviewers tiptoe, as they nervously pose their questions.</p> <p>The events of this summer have taken his popularity to a new level: a poll taken several weeks after the coup found that 68% of Turks approve of his handling of the situation. This is a lot more than the 52% of voters who propelled him to the presidency in 2014, when it seemed that the blush might be coming off the Erdo\u011fan bloom. Erdo\u011fan\u2019s ad hoc supporters include Kurds \u2013 Kurdish nationalists have been sorely mistreated by G\u00fclenist policemen and judiciary officials \u2013 as well as secularists who despise the G\u00fclen movement\u2019s secretive, cultish character.</p> <p>The president\u2019s standing was not harmed by the fact that he seems to have faced considerable personal danger on the night of the coup. He escaped capture in Marmaris by a matter of minutes and the presidential jet was buzzed mid-air by rebel F-16s on its way to Istanbul\u2019s Atat\u00fcrk airport; it could only land once the control tower had been liberated from the putschists. Erdo\u011fan is a bruiser from a hardscrabble Istanbul neighbourhood, whose legendary stare of disapproval has been known to terrify grown men; few Turks would have been surprised to hear that his sang-froid did not falter even when it looked as if the coup might succeed.</p> <p>When Erdo\u011fan played semi-professional football as a young man \u2013 he declined to turn pro because his father disapproved \u2013 he was known for warning his teammates about the perils of drinking and looking at girls. Now, at 62, he is Turkey\u2019s own severe father, who refuses to let the country\u2019s honour be soiled.</p> <p>His brilliance as a communicator \u2013 an aspect that tends to be ignored by his critics \u2013 is shown to best effect when he addresses his supporters directly. But none of his speeches that I have seen can compare in intensity and sophistication to the address he delivered nine days after the coup, praising the \u201cmartyrs\u201d who lost their lives defending the nation against the coup.</p> <p>The setting was a vertiginous conference hall attached to Erdo\u011fan\u2019s ostentatious new palace in Ankara. Among the crowd were the families of the martyrs, some holding framed photos of a husband or son. Some of the heroes of the resistance were also present \u2013 one on a stretcher. The president took to the stage in a dark suit and purple tie. Soon he was feeling expertly for the limits of his voice, alternating between hoarse denunciations of the coup, and low confiding riffs on the sanctity of death in the service of a holy cause.</p> <p>\u201cAfter prophethood,\u201d he said, \u201cmartyrdom is the next highest station\u201d; he confessed that he envied those who had fallen on the night of the coup. Then, he attacked the credulous G\u00fclenists, \u201cpoor fools\u201d and \u201capostates\u201d who had deluded themselves into believing that their leader was touched by divinity; for as Erdo\u011fan remonstrated sternly, \u201cwe are the slaves only of our God \u2026 only in prayer, in God\u2019s presence, do we genuflect.\u201d</p> <p>Rarely in Ankara \u2013 Atat\u00fcrk\u2019s citadel of secularism \u2013 can a speech by a politician have been so suffused with ideas of faith and infidelity. But for all his religiosity, Erdo\u011fan is arguably more of a nationalist than he is an Islamist: he is too much of a Turkish patriot to subscribe to a pan-Islamist ideology that would dissolve borders of land and ethnicity. His speech was as much about the pain and ecstasy of Turkishness as it was about God, and he quoted many stanzas of patriotic poetry \u2013 he has an excellent memory for verse and a fine delivery.</p> <p>\u201cThe martyrs\u2019 graveyard is not empty,\u201d the president declaimed, \u201cthe heroes await the earth, and the flag awaits the breeze to flutter.\u201d Returning the obvious adoration of his audience, he interrupted himself wonderingly: \u201cWhat a happy, what a blessed people we are \u2026 nowhere in the world can your equal be found.\u201d</p> <p>Of course a nation is nothing without enemies, and in Erdo\u011fan\u2019s depiction the failed coup exposed not one, but many. Referring to the mealy-mouthed reaction of Turkey\u2019s erstwhile western allies, he asked, \u201cAre we surprised?\u201d and then answered his own question with a no. \u201cAre we saddened? Yes, we are human.\u201d But what he called the \u201crebirth\u201d of 15 July had shown the Turks, he continued, that \u201cwe can expect neither justice, nor help, nor support, nor understanding from anyone \u2026 whatever we do, we\u2019ll do it ourselves.\u201d</p> <p>In this way, uniting the themes of faith, nation and death, the president piped his followers to a state of weeping, cheering helplessness. In their front rooms, at \u201cdemocracy vigils\u201d in main squares across the country, millions more watched him on screen. The following day, in conversations with ordinary Istanbullus, I heard many of them repeat phrases borrowed from Erdo\u011fan\u2019s speech \u2013 the sentiments of the leader, absorbed among the people as if by osmosis.</p> <p>The president\u2019s habit of referring to \u201cmy people\u201d; his promise to remake the Turkish state \u201croot and branch\u201d to undo the damage done by the G\u00fclenists; the economic objectives he has set for 2023, the centenary of the republic\u2019s founding \u2013 nothing here suggests a man who expects to become irrelevant. Erdo\u011fan has hollowed out the country\u2019s institutions \u2013 including the military, at long last \u2013 and has made himself even more indispensable. No problem is not of his making, and no solution possible without him.</p> <p>The constitution allows the president two five-year terms, which would take Erdo\u011fan to 2024 \u2013 21 years after he first became prime minister. But constitutions can change.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"b3e24740b88c456f61431147eb395b79696ff872\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b3e24740b88c456f61431147eb395b79696ff872/0_84_1579_1721/917.jpg\" alt=\"The then Prime Minister Erdo\u011fan shows ioff his football skills to the Queen, in 2008\" width=\"917\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The then Prime Minister Erdo\u011fan shows off his football skills to the Queen, in 2008.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Firat Yurdakul/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>* * *</h2> <p>The world\u2019s growing ranks of elected authoritarians may be refashioning democracy in their own image, but they still face considerable obstacles to out-and-out despotism. These regimes are defined in part by their proud disregard for the views of the minority \u2013 but an unrelenting majoritarianism hardens the opposition of the excluded.</p> <p>Erdo\u011fan still operates under significant political constraints. The country\u2019s Kurdish, Alevi, and secularist communities, who distrust him intensely, add up to roughly half of Turkey\u2019s population of 75 million. For all the AKP\u2019s status as Turkey\u2019s unrivalled party of government, under Erdo\u011fan\u2019s unquestioned dominance, he has not been able to compel parliament to give him the enhanced powers of the executive presidency he covets.</p> <p>Nor does Erdo\u011fan\u2019s authority as an embodiment of Turkish Sunni conservatism mean that he is about to turn on those who do not embrace this identity; it is doubtful that he would have the support of his base to do so. A recent privately commissioned poll to which I have had access shows that while a majority of Turkish voters want a ban on alcohol and almost half would support the use of illegal means in the fight against terrorism, there is also wide support for abstract notions such as liberty and freedom of expression.</p> <p>Erdo\u011fan trumpets his adherence to the will of his people, but he does not blindly pursue its whims. Having oscillated between Europhilia and Islamic fervour, universalism and isolationism, war and peace, it is clear that his political trajectory is that of a pragmatist who likes to keep his options open. His failure to pursue a ban on alcohol, despite the fact that it would please the base, is another instance of his pragmatism. That he regards secularism as useful \u2013 perhaps as a means of averting sectarian conflict \u2013 was demonstrated when he urged Mohamed Morsi to build a secular state after coming to power in Egypt in 2011.</p> <p>Even amid the purges, Erdo\u011fan has withdrawn all the suits he brought for insulting him \u2013 with the exception of the German comic, that is. He has also suspended hostilities with the main opposition party, the Alevi- and secularist-dominated Republican People\u2019s party (CHP). The CHP leader, Kemal K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu, himself an Alevi, was Erdo\u011fan\u2019s guest at a huge rally in Istanbul on 7 August, which allowed the president to stress the broad nature of the coalition against the coup, including people \u201cfrom all roots and of all spirits\u201d.</p> <p>Turkey is now trying to back out of its Syrian dead-end, and softening its opposition to the idea that Assad might retain a role in the postwar transition. Last week, the Turkish army joined the United States in a major cross-border offensive against Islamic State \u2013 with the additional aim of preventing the Syrian Kurds from establishing their own state on Turkey\u2019s southern border. To the north, the PKK may be preparing for a possible return to negotiations with Erdo\u011fan, having denounced the coup and announcing its readiness to help \u201cbuild a democratic Turkey\u201d.</p> <p>What that might look like is anyone\u2019s guess. The reign of Erdo\u011fan and other leaders in his mould is a clear sign that there is no longer a single model of democracy, stamped with EU or US approval, to which all countries aspire. It has long been common to contrast the emphasis laid by emerging non-western democracies on the will of the majority with the care taken by \u201cmature\u201d democracies to protect minority rights. But this flattering distinction may no longer be valid. The picture from France, the United States, and to an extent Britain suggests that a brazen majoritarianism has emerged from the crises and upheavals of the past decade. Erdo\u011fan may not resemble our stated democratic ideals, but he may be their future.

  "<p>On the New Airport road<em> </em>in the west Indian city of Pune, five Vodafone billboards are doing more to help the drought-hit village of Pimpri Sandas than the local government. The billboards, fitted with tanks, are harvesting rainwater. When the tanks are full, a text message sounds on the mobile phones of a 24/7 collection team and within hours red trucks roll in to collect the water and deliver it to Pimpri Sandas about an hour\u2019s drive away. The idea is simple, but for the farmers of the drought hit village it is life-changing.<br></p> <p>Since they were set up two months ago, Vodafone\u2019s smart billboards have become a lifeline for about 60 farmers who have been left penniless or in debt after four consecutive years of drought. Dada Navsare, a sugarcane and pomegranate farmer, gets a 2,000 litre tanker of water every day to help water his crop. </p> <p>\u201cFor four years [...] no crops have grown in this village. I have lost hundreds of thousands of rupees and I\u2019ve had to take out loans with an interest rate of 4% every month. I still have an outstanding loan of 250,000 rupees (\u00a32,800) to pay off. The government used to give us water, but it was a very small quantity and we didn\u2019t get it every day. We didn\u2019t even have water to drink. This year, since the trucks started delivering water, there have been no losses.\u201d</p> <p>Although Vodafone has made it clear the collected water is only for farming, the farmers also drink it since there are few other options. \u201cWe just use it as it is,\u201d says Navsare. \u201cWe don\u2019t purify it or boil it.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"adc8606309988474e2a11f7c2e2f009b24fa7098\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/adc8606309988474e2a11f7c2e2f009b24fa7098/82_0_1878_1620/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Vodafone billboards on the New Airport road near Pune\" width=\"1000\" height=\"863\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Vodafone billboards on the New Airport road near Pune.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The billboards are fitted with a U-shaped aluminium sheet to funnel water through a tube to the tanks which can store up to 2,000 litres of water at the bottom of each hoarding. Each tank is fitted with water sensor technology to alert employees when the tanks are full. The billboards are serviced by a collection team which transports the stored rainwater to villages in trucks. Every part of the process is funded by Vodafone.</p> <p>The smart billboards, designed by advertising firm Kinetic, could be used in other regions, says Siddharth Banerjee, CMO of Vodafone India: \u201cWhile this initiative has been implemented in Maharashtra, we expect this effort to be replicated in other geographies of India.\u201d More than 330 million people across the country were <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/20/india-drought-affecting-330-million-people-weak-monsoons\">affected by drought</a> earlier this year.</p> <p>\u201cWe are talking to the local government in Maharashtra and in the state of Haryana about fitting many more billboards with tanks,\u201d says Somnath Sengupta, national creative director of Kinetic. \u201cYou can give these farmers money, you can give them food, that\u2019ll help them for a while. But what they really need is water.\u201d </p> <p>In India, increasingly extreme weather has added to the water woes of farmers across the country.

  "<p>Ian Bell has completed a deal to play for Perth Scorchers in the forthcoming edition of Australia\u2019s Big Bash League. But while he considers himself \u201call in\u201d with his new Twenty20 team, it is not, he insists, a sign that his international ambitions have diminished.</p> <p>The signing of the Warwickshire captain, as first reported <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/22/ian-bell-under-consideration-england-test-recall-bangladesh-india-trevor-bayliss\">by the Guardian last week</a>, commits him to Perth for the entire tournament and he will fly out to Western Australia with family in November in preparation for their opening fixture with Adelaide Strikers on 23 December.</p> <p>Only an England recall for the tours of Bangladesh and India would cause a change in this itinerary \u2013 the final Test before Christmas finishes on 20 December \u2013 and although the head coach, Trevor Bayliss, sounded Bell out about this outside possibility a fortnight ago, it is not something on his radar at present.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s an opportunity that when the Perth coach, Justin Langer, rang me about I was quite surprised,\u201d Bell said. \u201cBut when you watch the Big Bash at home it looks fantastic and to be involved is very exciting. I started my journey in Perth playing grade cricket for the University of Western Australia too and so to go back and play in Perth again is something I am proud of.\u201d</p> <p>Asked whether his arrangement with Perth contains scope for a late arrival, were he to be part of the England Test side touring this winter, Bell replied: \u201cWe haven\u2019t spoken about any of that stuff yet. I\u2019m all in with Perth Scorchers at the minute.</p> <p>\u201cEvery player has ambitions to play for England and until I retire I am no different. This season I haven\u2019t thought about it too much \u2013 it does you no good thinking about things that are out of your control anyway. I\u2019m sure my phone won\u2019t be switched off [when the England selectors meet in September]. As captain at Warwickshire, it never stops ringing anyway.\u201d</p> <p>Bell has not made an overwhelming case for a Test recall through his numbers in county cricket this summer, with an unbeaten 94 in the 50-over semi-final win against Somerset at Edgbaston on Monday his highest score since a century in the opening week of the County Championship against Hampshire in April.</p> <p>The England management, however, are understood to have debated whether to parachute his 118 caps of experience back into their struggling middle order, something that would require a strong end to the season with Warwickshire, starting at home against the leaders Middlesex this Wednesday, to make such a recall not look unmerited.</p> <p>Either way, the Perth deal comes after Bell\u2019s best season in Twenty20 cricket to date, with the right\u2011hander having scored five half\u2011centuries for Birmingham Bears in the NatWest T20 Blast and averaged 40, with a strike-rate of 130.</p> <p>Langer, the Perth head coach, said: \u201cIt\u2019s exciting to be able to add a player of Ian\u2019s top-level experience and quality to our squad. With 22 Test centuries and a one\u2011day international average close to 40, he\u2019ll bolster our batting options.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s played at the international level for more than a decade so brings experience and leadership having captained his county side Warwickshire and the Birmingham Bears. We\u2019re delighted to have him on board.\u201d</p>",

His 2013 New York City mayoral bid foundered on a similar scandal.</p> <p>Weiner\u2019s Twitter account has been deleted. The Clinton campaign did not immediately reply to a request for comment. </p> <p>The Post on Monday published texts and images said to have been sent and received by Weiner about a year ago, in July 2015. The images include one that appears to have been sent by Weiner in which his young son, asleep, is visible in the background.</p> <p>As his mayoral bid collapsed, Abedin, already anticipating Clinton\u2019s presidential run, appeared alongside Weiner and expressed support for him. She did not appear at a concession speech he gave at the end of the campaign.

  "<p>In politics, perception is everything. What an elected representative says and the legislation they enact sends a clear message to the community the priorities of the government.</p> <p>If this is true, in New South Wales we have the extraordinary situation where the government appears to place more importance on preventing littering than on the life of a cyclist.</p> <p>ABC radio announcer, James Valentine, who hosts a hugely entertaining afternoon show on 702 Sydney, recently broadcast a series of interviews with <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/local/audio/2016/06/23/4487871.htm\">citizens who had received fines from the Environment Protection Authority for littering</a>. Except these bewildered offenders swear they didn\u2019t do it. On further investigation, super-sleuth Valentine discovered there existed an army of \u201clitter-dobbers\u201d who could report an incident online, and the EPA with no investigation whatsoever and little regard to the tenet of \u201cinnocent until proven guilty\u201d, simply issued a fine to the supposed offender.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/aug/24/sydney-australia-war-cyclists-fines\">Sydney's 'war on cyclists': 'I got fined $106 for not having a bell'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It doesn\u2019t take a genius to work out this system is open to abuse. Don\u2019t like your neighbour? Simple, dob him in for littering.</p> <p>Listeners were quick to phone Valentine with similar incidents where they had been wrongfully accused and fined. In each case, the onus was on the person receiving the fine to prove their innocence, not on the witness or the agency to verify that the incident did in fact take place. In NSW, littering is taken very seriously. So seriously that natural justice is suspended in the interest of keeping cigarette butts and pie wrappers off our footpaths.</p> <p>Now to cycling. NSW Police <a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/number-of-cycle-fines-surge-in-months-after-stiffer-penalties-introduced-in-nsw-20160517-goxld9.html\">recently released the data on fines issued to cyclists </a>for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/aug/24/sydney-australia-war-cyclists-fines\">such offences as riding without a helmet</a>, riding without an appropriate warning device (a bell), and riding on a footpath. The figures showed a huge windfall to the government with revenue increasing seven-fold. This increase is largely due to two factors: stiffer penalties introduced by the Baird government for cycling misdemeanours, and an increased police focus on cyclists. While the NSW government was raking in the cash from cyclists, the new \u201csafe cycling\u201d legislation had led to only four motorists being fined for not passing cyclists at a safe distance.</p> <p>The police and the government, by their actions, have shown that its the cycling fraternity they plan to target rather than motorists who carelessly steer two-tonnes of metal close to a fellow citizen. Some cyclists have fitted digital action cameras to their bikes in the hope of recording the wayward motorists.</p> <p>Recently I was passed dangerously by a vehicle on a road in regional NSW. When I caught up to the motorist at a stop sign, I tapped on his window and asked him if he realised how close he was to hitting me with his vehicle. He shrugged and said, \u201cIf I\u2019ve broken a road rule, tell the police.\u201d</p> <p>So I did. I took the video evidence, recorded on the action camera attached to my bicycle seat-post, to the local police station where a police officer copied the footage, accepted my statement and promised to look into the matter.</p> <p>A month later, I received an email from the police officer advising me that he spoke to the motorist who admitted that he hadn\u2019t seen me until I\u2019d tapped on his window. As the motorist in question had an unblemished record, the police officer \u2013 on advice from his supervisor \u2013 issued a warning, rather than a traffic infringement notice and accompanying fine.</p> <p>This despite the fact that the motorist had virtually admitted he had been paying so little attention to what was in front of him that he hadn\u2019t seen me until I tapped on his window. In my police statement, accompanied by the video evidence, I had verified that on returning to the scene after the incident and aided by the video footage and road markings, I was able to estimate that the distance between the vehicle\u2019s passenger side mirror and my handlebars was between 30 and 50cm \u2013 clearly a breach of the road rules.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/aug/25/sydney-australia-bike-lane-skeptic-cycling-duncan-gay-cycleways\">Australia's biggest bike-lane sceptic 'wants to destroy cycling in Sydney'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In this case, the police erred on the side of the motorist. In my follow-up email to the police officer, I wondered if the police would have been so accommodating if the motorist had admitted to not seeing a stop sign, a pedestrian crossing or a school speed-zone sign?</p> <p>The police officer treated my initial complaint with respect and acted in a thoroughly professional manner. However one could argue that in NSW, the perception of the police going easy on motorists and being quick to charge cyclists remains. My experience does not dispel that this.</p> <p>Could the seven-fold increase in fines to cyclists perhaps have been avoided if the police had simply issued warnings to each offender regarding the recent changes to the road rules?</p> <p>Now the unscrupulous among us may suggest I would have been better served by dobbing the motorist in for \u201clittering\u201d rather than for nearly killing me.

  "<p> Victoria is to introduce a permanent ban on all onshore unconventional gas exploration, including fracking and coal seam gas, becoming the first Australian state to do so.</p> <p>The premier, Daniel Andrews, made the announcement on Tuesday morning and said legislation for the ban would be introduced later this year, making the current moratorium on unconventional gas exploration permanent.</p> <p> A parliamentary inquiry last year into onshore unconventional gas in Victoria received more than 1,600 submissions, most of them opposed to fracking and coal seam gas exploration.</p> <p>A statement from the Department of Premier and Cabinet said: \u201cIt is clear that the Victorian community has spoken. They simply don\u2019t support fracking.</p> <p>\u201cThe government\u2019s decision is based on the best available evidence and acknowledges that the risks involved outweigh any potential benefits to Victoria.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/01/court-rules-in-santos-favour-over-coal-seam-gas-water-treatment-plant-in-pilliga\">Court rules in Santos's favour over coal seam gas water treatment plant in Pilliga</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The government said the move would protect the reputation of Victoria\u2019s agriculture sector, which employs more than 190,000 people; provide certainty to regional communities; and end anxiety felt by farmers about the environmental and health risks associated with fracking.</p> <p>Exemptions to the ban will remain for activities not covered by the current moratorium, such as gas storage, carbon storage research and accessing offshore resources. Exploration and development for offshore gas will also continue.</p> <p>The Greens energy spokeswoman, Ellen Sandell, welcomed the news, describing it as \u201ca relief to communities that have fought the threat of fracking for years\u201d.<br></p> <p>\u201cThis decision proves the power of grassroots advocacy,\u201d she said. \u201cIndividuals have won over powerful and influential mining companies, and the Greens are proud to have led the political campaign which forced the government to support a permanent ban.</p> <p>\u201cBut it\u2019s disappointing the government is leaving the door open to conventional gas drilling after the next state election. We won\u2019t stop fighting until all onshore gas drilling is banned.\u201d<br></p> <p>A dairy farmer in the Victorian coastal town of Seaspray, Julie Boulton, said the threat of unconventional gas mining had been hanging over farmers\u2019 heads for years. \u201cIt has been so heart-wrenching at times, when we thought the drill rigs were coming and there was nothing we could do,\u201d she said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/may/11/fossil-fuel-register-shows-more-than-a-third-of-australia-earmarked-for-coal-or-gas\">Fossil fuel register shows more than a third of Australia earmarked for coal or gas</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cBut we pulled together as a community and decided to fight this threat to our farmland, water and health and today\u2019s decision is just fantastic \u2013 we are ecstatic.\u201d</p> <p>Over the past five years the Lock the Gate coalition of rural communities, environmental groups and farmers has fought unconventional gas exploration.</p> <p>Chloe Aldenhoven, coordinator for Lock the Gate, said about 1.4m hectares of Victoria was threatened by some form of onshore gas mining, which included coal seam gas, tight gas, shale gas and underground coal gasification. \u201cLabor has shown real leadership by listening to community concerns,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cThis is good news for every Victorian, but for the farming communities that have been fighting to stop this industry for over five years now, this is a wonderful day. This decision gives them certainty to move forward, and this decision protects Victoria\u2019s vital clean and green image.\u201d </p> <p> Principal Adviser at The Australia Institute, Mark Ogge, praised the ban as \u201csound economic and energy policy\u201d.<br> He said that Queensland\u2019s experiment in unconventional gas had demonstrated that the economic benefits promised by the gas industry had largely failed to materialise, while negatively impacting other industries. Research had found that for every 10 new gas jobs, 18 agricultural jobs were lost, he said.</p> <p>\u201cThe manufacturing industry has been one of the biggest losers with LNG exports allowing gas suppliers to drive up prices to Australian users, and suppliers exercising their market power keep Australian prices high even as global prices collapsed,\u201d Ogge said.</p> <p>\u201cWe now have the ridiculous situation that Australian gas is now cheaper in Korea than it is in Australia. That\u2019s a double-disaster for local manufacturing jobs.</p> <p>\u201cWhat benefits there are, have gone almost entirely to the overseas owners of global oil and gas companies licensed to export Australian gas, largely at the expense of Australian businesses and local jobs.\u201d</p>",
