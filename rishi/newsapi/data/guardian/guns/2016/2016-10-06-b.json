  "<p>Fresh evidence of skills shortages has fanned fears about British companies\u2019 long-term prospects if the government follows through on talk of an immigration crackdown.</p> <p>A monthly check on the recruitment market published on Friday added to signs that employers have rebounded from the initial shock of the Brexit vote at least for now. Permanent hiring rose for the second month running in September, after declining in June and July. </p> <p>But the Recruitment and Employment Confederation (REC) also found the availability of permanent and temporary staff continued to fall in September. At the same time demand for staff continued to rise and there was solid growth in starting salaries for people placed in permanent jobs.</p> <p>The trade body said that based on its poll of 400 recruitment consultancies, those jobs suffering skills shortages included accountants, HGV drivers, architects, care workers, scientists and toolmakers. For temporary jobs there were shortages of electricians, call centre staff and bricklayers.</p> <p>Theresa May <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/05/theresa-may-consigns-cameron-to-history-in-populist-speech\">hinted at a tougher line on immigration</a> in her speech to the Conservative party conference this week and home secretary Amber Rudd <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/05/government-faces-backlash-from-business-leaders-over-foreign-workers\">incited a backlash from business leaders</a> over proposals to force companies to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/05/amber-rudd-defends-proposal-to-make-firms-reveal-foreign-staff-numbers\">disclose how many foreign workers they employ</a>. </p> <p>REC policy director Tom Hadley said the government must be mindful that many UK employers were already facing talent shortages. <br></p> <p>\u201cDespite some of the rhetoric at this week\u2019s Conservative party conference, we will continue to need workers from overseas in a range of sectors from engineering to healthcare,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cThe business community must have a role in developing an immigration model that strikes the right balance.\u201d <br></p> <p>The report, compiled for REC by data company IHS Markit, showed that as demand for staff rose and skills shortages continued to be felt, successful job candidates were able to secure higher starting salaries last month. </p> <p>Companies\u2019 apparent willingness to continue hiring despite worries over Brexit chimes with other recent indicators <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/21/post-referendum-gloom-fears-confounded-economic-evidence\">suggesting business activity and confidence has rebounded</a>.</p> <p>UK business confidence recovered to be almost at pre-referendum levels during September driven by large increases in organisations\u2019 optimism for both the UK economy and their own prospects over the coming year, according to a poll from YouGov released on Friday.<br></p> <p>For first time since the referendum, more than half of businesses were optimistic about their prospects in the next year, according to YouGov\u2019s report, which was compiled with the Centre for Economics and Business Research (CEBR) using responses from 500 business people.</p> <p>The report\u2019s main business confidence index rose to 112.4 last month, not far off June\u2019s reading of 112.6 and May\u2019s 112.5.<br></p> <p>\u201cIt is now clear that business confidence took a short-term stumble in the wake of the EU vote instead of a long-term fall,\u201d said Scott Corfe, director at the CEBR.<br></p> <p>\u201cHowever, it should be noted that this research was carried out before the Conservative party conference and all the talk of \u2018hard Brexit\u2019 implying that the UK would prioritise immigration restrictions over access to the European single market. Once the shape of our economic relationship with the EU becomes clearer, these figures could shift notably.\u201d </p>",
  "<p>One evening, about 10 years ago, I turned down the volume on my compact disc player and used the phone attached to a wall to call my girlfriend. Later, she got a taxi back to our home and we watched a movie hired from the local video store. As the film played, the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere hovered just above 380 parts per million. </p> <p>It is a very different experience today, with Uber, music and films all available on the same smart phone as the tweets that tell me that we\u2019ve swept past 400 parts of carbon dioxide per million, and on which I text my wife using a stream of emoji and pictures. </p> <p>Radical as they are, these changes are more than just shifts in the banal details of daily life. They are symptoms of economic upheaval brought about by new technologies that are occurring simultaneously with unprecedented convulsions in our physical environment. </p> <p>Things have changed quickly. And for both good and ill, we ain\u2019t seen nothing yet. Nobody knows what we will be doing in a decade\u2019s time.

On the other hand \u2013 to pick just one economic indicator \u2013 almost <a href=\"http://www.ceda.com.au/2015/06/16/five-million-Aussie-jobs-gone-in-10-to-15-years\" rel=\"nofollow\">40%</a> of Australian jobs have a likelihood of disappearing in the next 10 to 15 years because of the tech revolution.</p> <p>The future of work will be made up of jobs that don\u2019t yet exist within industries and using technologies that are new, in planetary conditions that no human being has ever experienced. Given that there is no status quo option, we need a fundamental debate over the shape and purpose of the new economy. How do we achieve a new economy squarely in the service of society, not only geared towards ecological limits, but also oriented to fairness and justice? </p> <p>First, we need a language that evokes a different set of values and priorities to the status quo. Last year when the prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.malcolmturnbull.com.au/media/launch-of-the-national-innovation-and-science-agenda1\" rel=\"nofollow\">described</a> the people of Australia as \u201cassets\u201d and \u201chuman capital\u201d, he gave expression to a whole value system that sees us foremost as economic units and everything we do and experience in life as ripe for commodification. When the terms of debate are limited to the language and concepts of bankers and management consultants, there can be no broader vision and no recourse to deeper values. </p> <p>Second, we must understand that policy follows power. In contested areas of public life, it is the ideas with the greatest political force behind them that will triumph. In national policy debates, the <a href=\"https://www.thesaturdaypaper.com.au/opinion/topic/2016/07/02/how-business-lobbyists-trump-your-vote/14673816003445\" rel=\"nofollow\">power of vested interests</a> \u2013 fossil fuel miners, big banks and the like \u2013 can be overcome only through organised people. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/sep/26/with-robots-is-a-life-without-work-one-wed-want-to-live\">With robots, is a life without work one we'd want to live?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Accordingly, ensuring that the rules of the new economy are defined for the common good is above all a challenge of political cooperation. Anyone who wants a fairer and more sustainable Australia needs to reach out to others to seek common cause in a collaborative vision. A sufficiently powerful coalition will require alliances across classes, engaging progressive movements, existing social institutions and socially embedded business. </p> <p>Third, we must remind ourselves who is in charge here. It is essential that changes in technology are the subject of democratic debate and control. Tech shapes our practical access to rights and freedoms and shapes our human subjectivity in all kinds of ways. </p> <p>Yet from augmented reality to artificial intelligence, technological change is too often regarded, fatalistically, as inevitable or even as outside of politics altogether. And we seem curiously untroubled by the monumental concentration of power in global tech corporations. We need to think about tech more actively and more critically, grasping the enormous potential for good, while guarding against the potential for tyranny.</p> <p>The fourth industrial revolution contains enormous emancipative power \u2013 if we can get the politics sorted out. The future is still open. It is up to the power of organised people to ensure that the new economy serves the greater good, not just narrow vested interests. </p> <p>Primacy has to go to the urgent just transition to a low carbon economy because everything else depends on reducing greenhouse gas emissions. </p> <p>If we want to see a new Australian economy built on fairness, kindness, justice and sustainability then we must use the language and assemble the alliances necessary to provide the political momentum for our vision to be both imagined and realised. <em> </em></p>",
  "<p>The Socceroos have hung on for a 2-2 draw with Saudi Arabia as striker Nasser Al Shamrani again proved the troublemaker against Australia. A draw may disappoint but the Socceroos\u2019 improving mentality bodes well for World Cup campaign.</p> <p>If a scrappy equaliser blots Australia\u2019s copybook the difference in mentality between Australia and Saudi Arabia speaks volumes as to the Socceroos\u2019 long-term maturation. Amid the hot and humid conditions of Jeddah\u2019s King Abdullah Stadium, Socceroos boss Ange Postecoglou captured the team\u2019s mood post-game accurately and succinctly: \u201cIt\u2019s a good point, but you feel we could have got more out of it.\u201d</p> <p>An objective onlooker, he isn\u2019t. But even the most partisan fan would struggle to dispute his assessment. In a fleeting vignette of their potential Saudi Arabia started the brighter of the two sides, hurrying and harrying the Australian defence with a high press, and striking with a clarity of purpose and quality of execution.</p> <p>Their fifth-minute goal followed excellent lead up work from Nawaf Al Abid, who used close control and an attacking mindset to put a sharp ball through for Yahia Al Shehri, whose inch-perfect cutback was well dispatched by the late-arriving Taiseer Al Jassam.</p> <p>It was a passage of play that cut straight through the Australian defence and sent an early warning shot across the bows of those that denigrate the ever-increasing quality of Asian football.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/06/arsene-wenger-arsenal-future-will-be-mutually-decided-chief-executive-ivan-gazidis\">Ars\u00e8ne Wenger\u2019s Arsenal future will be mutually decided, says chief executive</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And yet, with Australia seemingly there for the taking, two serious limitations \u2013 a creeping psychological fragility and Dutch coach Bert van Marwijk\u2019s conservative inclination \u2013 always presented as a potential limitation for the home side.</p> <p>A coach can only play the cards he is dealt but van Marwijk showed his hand at the 2010 World Cup. Given aces like Robin van Persie, Arjen Robben or Rafael van der Vaart the former Feyenoord boss gambled on eights and nines.</p> <p>The pragmatist will say van Marwijk saw in twin enforcers Mark van Bommel and Nigel de Jong a comparative advantage for his nation, and exploited that ruthlessly as the Dutch shaded five consecutive games by a one-goal margin en route to one of the more notorious finals in recent history. But those who hang their cap on the hatstand of results quickly fade when the fixtures turn.</p> <p>With the crowd behind them, confidence streaming through the players, this game was Saudi Arabia\u2019s to lose. The usually excellent Aaron Mooy missed passes. Robbie Kruse and Mathew Leckie returned to ponderousness in attack, even skipper Mile Jedinak looked lumbering, a needless yellow card following one particular cameo in rustiness.</p> <p>But if Saudi Arabia invited their opponents upon them, then conversely Australia deserve praise for the manner in which they accepted the invitation.</p> <p>As the half developed the Socceroos began to raise their intensity. Mooy\u2019s industry began to sway the balance in the heart of the field, Rogic increasingly looked the pre-eminent playmaker on the pitch and by the time Brad Smith, nervous in his opening exchanges, decided to take on his man, work inside and produce a driving run and shot that clattered the post, Australia were well and truly in the ascendency. </p> <p>It was Trent Sainsbury who executed the goal, but it was an equaliser that hailed from the ongoing project of self-belief that Ange Postecoglou has spent years trying to instil within the Socceroos. </p> <p>The 51,616 strong crowd arrived in pageantry with a stunning half-stadium tifo to support their side and had a vocal lead supporter \u2013 half capo, half muezzin \u2013 calling the Green Falcons on to victory, but they were silenced. For all the bombast pre-game of making King Abdullah Stadium \u201chell\u201d for the Socceroos, the crowd rarely seemed a factor for Australia.</p> <p>Instead of trusting in the talent of Al Abid, Al Shehri or Al Jassam to once again crack open Australia, Saudi Arabia instead leant on gamesmanship \u2013 shoelaces refused to stay tied; cramps laid low athletes in their prime, and the goalkeeper played with ribs of rare Venetian glass.</p> <p>As Postecoglou bellowed for his team to keep focus, to stay sharp and to rise above, van Marwijk looked uneasy, eyes twitching as he paced the technical area. The otherwise excellent Omar Hawsawi succumbed to injury, but the Socceroos refused to allow what initially looked a dubious call for the stretcher to break their rhythm. And less than a minute later they took a deserved lead.</p> <p>Kruse \u2013 too often Australia\u2019s Theo Walcott \u2013 executed a perfect arching cross. Tomi Juric, another who continues to grow into his role was on hand to finish ruthlessly. </p> <p>Stop the contest there and Postecoglou and his men, as they did against the UAE, have executed their game plan to absolute perfection, overcoming near-inhumane conditions and numerous logistical challenges to land another emphatic blow on an Asian powerhouse.</p> <p>But after an eighteen month absence from the national side, Al Shamrani was always bristling to become the defining narrative. Like so many champions, the five-time Saudi domestic league golden boot winner displays a confidence that on a daily basis would prove unbearable. But the renewed hope his substitution gave the crowd and the confidence his goal gave his teammates was notable.</p> <p>The Socceroos might feel aggrieved to have dropped potentially crucial points, but the improved mentality they showed throughout this performance places them in good stead for the campaign ahead. Japan on Tuesday is a litmus test, but irrespective of individual results a long-run trend of maturation and self-belief continues to develop.</p>",

  "<p>The federal government is investigating prisons throughout Alabama in an inquiry that is \u201cpossibly unprecedented\u201d. The investigation comes after a series of strikes and riots that have revealed the state\u2019s prisons are in turmoil.<br></p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a giant investigation. This is rare,\u201d said Lisa Graybill, a staff attorney for the Southern Poverty Law Center, which is conducting an investigation of its own. Previously Graybill worked for the federal unit that will investigate Alabama, and said the closest comparison in memory was an examination of Puerto Rico\u2019s juvenile jails. \u201cTaking on a whole state is unusual and possibly unprecedented,\u201d she said.</p> <p>According to the Department of Justice (DoJ) the investigation will focus on whether prisoners are protected from physical and sexual abuse by other prisoners and guards, and whether living conditions are sanitary and safe in general at men\u2019s prisons.</p> <p>Alabama\u2019s prisons \u2013 particularly the notorious Holman prison \u2013 were at the forefront of a nationwide call for prisoners to strike from work, last month. On 9 September prisoners across the US began a strike that lasted several days, in some places. And at Holman, guards joined striking prisoners by staying home from work.</p> <p>Those strikes also came on the heels of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/20/alabama-prison-riots-chaos-and-mayhem\">two riots</a> at Holman. During the riot inmates had stabbed warden Carter Davenport and another guard. They set fire to the dorm and carried prison-made swords. The warden and guard survived the attack, and special security squads swept in to quash the riot. But a few days later another riot started after one inmate stabbed another. Davenport, who declined to speak with the Guardian about the unrest, recently resigned his position.</p> <p>\u201cOur obligation is to protect the civil rights of all citizens, including those who are incarcerated,\u201d US attorney Joyce White Vance, of northern Alabama, wrote in a press briefing on Thursday.</p> <p>Her counterpart in southern Alabama, US attorney Kenyen R Brown, said prisoners \u201cshould expect sanitary conditions of habitation that are free of physical harm and sexual abuse\u201d.</p> <p>Graybill said the uproar has pulled back a veil that previously obscured Alabama\u2019s prison conditions. Litigation in California and Arizona have recently brought reform but Alabama\u2019s prisons are the most overcrowded, operating at about 183% capacity. \u201cThere is a national recognition that Alabama is in crisis,\u201d Graybill said.</p> <p>The federal government is stepping in because although prisons are run by states, they are beholden to the US constitution. </p> <p>\u201cThe constitution requires that prisons provide humane conditions of confinement,\u201d Vanita Gupta, head of the DoJ\u2019s civil rights division, said Thursday. </p> <p>The welfare of prisoners comes under the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act, which grants the DoJ authority to investigate violations of prisoners\u2019 constitutional rights that result from a \u201cpattern or practice of resistance to the full enjoyment of such rights\u201d. The department has investigated other correctional systems previously, but the scope of the current inquiry \u2013 an entire state \u2013 may be unique.</p> <p>\u201cWe hope to work cooperatively with the state of Alabama in conducting our inquiry and ensuring that the state\u2019s facilities keep prisoners safe from harm,\u201d Gupta said.</p>",
  "<p>Any future biopic of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/paul-ince\">Manchester United\u2019s Paul Ince</a> will have to pick another title, because this one is taken. This is a surprisingly engaging and forthright film about Lenny \u201cthe Guv\u2019nor\u201d McLean, the East End bareknuckle fighter, club bouncer and gangland figure who became famous with a cameo role in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2000/aug/13/comment.features\">Guy Ritchie\u2019</a>s movie Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels. I expected the usual sentimental geezer-gangster stuff, and there are some cliches. But it is an interesting and personal piece of work, presented by Lenny\u2019s son Jamie, who, despite his own problems and brushes with the law \u2013 and what I think might be undiagnosed depression \u2013 is engaging, intelligent and likable. Lenny was brutalised by an abusive stepfather and his surviving siblings still refuse to speak on camera. He was driven by anxiety to prove himself the hardest guy in London: a violent man with flashes of wit and charm who was brought back from the brink, just about, by his family. Nice work from Jamie McLean, here. If <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/danny-dyer\">Danny Dyer</a> deserves a part in EastEnders, so does Jamie.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mb6f9nbgupc\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/mb6f9nbgupc?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Watch the trailer for The Guv\u2019nor</figcaption> </figure>",
  "<p>For Wales it was a point that could have been three and also came at a cost, yet once the dust settles and Chris Coleman and his players clear their heads, they will come to view this as a valuable result. Despite leading twice, Wales were never in control of the game and Marko Arnautovic ruthlessly capitalised on some slack defending to earn Austria the draw that they deserved.</p> <p>While Coleman was bitterly disappointed with the way Wales gifted Austria and Arnautovic a second goal shortly after the interval, the sight of Joe Allen pulling up with a hamstring problem was every bit as troubling. With fellow midfielder Aaron Ramsey already missing through injury, the loss of Allen is a blow that Wales could really do without ahead of Sunday\u2019s home match against Georgia.</p> <p>The Stoke City player opened the scoring against Austria with a brilliant volley \u2013 his third goal in as many matches for club and country \u2013 and Wales will badly miss his craft and guile against a Georgia side that are likely to come to Cardiff with the intention of frustrating Coleman\u2019s team.</p> <p>The manager said that Allen \u201chad a twinge in the hamstring\u201d and revealed that the 26-year-old would undergo a scan in the next 24 hours to establish the extent of the problem. He made it clear, however, that Wales would not be prepared to take any risks and on that basis it seems highly unlikely that Allen will feature against Georgia.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/06/republic-of-ireland-georgia-world-cup-2018-qualifier-match-report\">Republic of Ireland win ugly but Robbie Brady injury mars result against Georgia</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThat\u2019s how it is,\u201d Coleman said, when it was put to him that Wales will badly miss two of their most creative players. \u201cWe probably won\u2019t have Joe, we already don\u2019t have Rambo. Have we got enough to get a result on Sunday without Joe Allen? Yes, we have. So I won\u2019t make any excuses.\u201d</p> <p>In the end Wales just about got over the line against Austria. Hanging on at times and indebted to some fine goalkeeping from Wayne Hennessey, the visitors managed to keep Austria at bay in the final half hour to collect a point from what is their toughest qualification game on paper.</p> <p>Coleman was the first to admit that it was not pretty to watch \u2013 it says much about this Wales performance that they looked most dangerous when Gareth Bale was taking long throws \u2013 yet there was also satisfaction to be taken from the result they gleaned in difficult circumstances.</p> <p>\u201cPeople look at us, because of what happened in the tournament [the European Championship finals in the summer], and think we will come into his campaign and play every game as if we\u2019re Barcelona or Spain, but it just doesn\u2019t work like that,\u201d the Wales manager said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/06/world-cup-qualifying-roundup-de-rossi-draw-italy-spain-iceland-finland\">World Cup qualifying roundup: De Rossi earns draw for Italy against Spain</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cSometimes you have to pick a result up and play ugly and that was how you would describe that performance tonight.</p> <p>\u201cIn terms of quality with the ball, we gave away a lot of possession, we made a lot of mistakes and we looked indecisive, which is not something you can say about this team on too many occasions.</p> <p>\u201cTo give them a goal from the restart within two or three minutes ... we don\u2019t do things like that,\u201d Coleman added. \u201cWe started slow and nervous [in the second half], they got a goal and they came for us for 20 minutes, but I\u2019ve got to give credit to the players for hanging on.\u201d</p> <p>While it was difficult to remember a Wales game when Bale was so anonymous for long periods, the Real Madrid forward still managed to have a hand in both goals. It was Bale\u2019s run and cross down the left that led to Allen, after some poor defending from Kevin Wimmer, striking a glorious 22-yard left-footed volley into the far corner of the net.</p> <p>Austria, however, were level only six minutes later. David Alaba, the Bayern Munich left-back who plays in central midfield for his country, showed his class with a pitching wedge pass over the top of the Wales defence that picked out Arnautovic\u2019s clever run. Darting in from the left, the Stoke winger got away from Chris Gunter before stooping to head past Hennessey.</p> <p>Although Coleman was entitled to be annoyed with the Austria coach Marcel Koller\u2019s pre-match claim that Wales were lucky at Euro 2016, there was no doubt that the visitors benefited from a large slice of good fortune on the stroke of half-time. Bale\u2019s long throw was flicked on by Sam Vokes and when goalkeeper Robert Almer blocked James Chester\u2019s diving header with his legs, the ball bounced off Wimmer and over the line.</p> <p>Then came the error that led to Austria\u2019s second equaliser. Allen\u2019s careless pass inside the Wales half had Chester stretching for a ball that he was unable to control and Arnautovic pounced. Sprinting clear in the inside left channel, Arnautovic expertly steered the ball into the far corner and Austria were level again.</p>",

  "<p>Mark McCall, the director of rugby of the European and Premiership champions Saracens, has hit out at the timing of this week\u2019s England training camp in Brighton, at which two players have suffered long-term injuries. He said he was \u201cflabbergasted\u201d that it was being held less than two weeks before the start of the European Champions Cup and questioned why the clubs were not consulted before it was put in the calendar.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2016/oct/06/england-rugby-union-injuries\">England\u2019s run of serious training injuries is about more than bad luck | Robert Kitson</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Wasps flanker Sam Jones suffered <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/05/sam-jones-miss-england-autumn-internationals-broken-leg\">a broken leg during a judo session</a> and the Bath wing Anthony Watson returned to his club <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/06/anthony-watson-out-of-england-autumn-internationals-with-broken-jaw-bath-rugby-union\">with a broken jaw</a>. Both players will know on Friday exactly how long they will be out after seeing specialists, but neither will be involved in England\u2019s autumn international campaign and they are facing the prospect of not playing again this year.</p> <p>This week\u2019s camp, which followed one in August, was arranged as part of the new eight-year elite player agreement between the clubs and the Rugby Football Union. In return for more than \u00a325m a year, Premiership Rugby agreed, among other changes, that the national head coach would have extra training camps in October and in January, a month before the start of the autumn series and Six Nations respectively. Both are Champions Cup months.</p> <p>\u201cInjuries can happen in training sessions,\u201d said McCall. \u201cWe do not have control over the contest of England\u2019s camps, nor should we. What I would prefer to talk about is that, from my club\u2019s point of view, Premiership Rugby could have fought harder as to when these camps were situated [in the season calendar]. We would like to have been involved in that discussion and to have one 10 days before the first Champions Cup games is flabbergasting.</p> <p>\u201cIt seems strange that the clubs were not consulted and we have got to fight our corner in this. The directors of rugby in the Premiership should at least be asked when they think the England training days should be. It was a done deal in the calendar and when I raised an objection to it, there was surprise that there should be any problem. There are competing needs and Premiership Rugby should have some non-negotiables.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/video/2016/oct/06/england-suffer-double-injury-blow-ahead-autumn-internationals-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/56a27\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2782654\"            data-video-name=\"England suffer double injury blow before autumn internationals \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"theguardian.com\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57f66a8ee4b03b0685c0839e\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/10/06/061016samjones_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/10/06/061016samjones_V3.webm\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/10/06/061016samjones.m3u8\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/video/2016/oct/06/england-suffer-double-injury-blow-ahead-autumn-internationals-video\">England suffer double injury blow before autumn internationals</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>\u201cPremiership Rugby need to be careful chasing all this money if it comes at the expense of the clubs who need to be strong and fight their corner as the RFU will fight theirs for the international game. I was part of a system in Ireland where the Pro 12 became a bit devalued because the bigger international players did not play for their teams on a consistent basis. We already have a league where our best players do not play for half of the campaign. That is a big enough thing but to have them away before a game as big as Wasps on Sunday and 10 days before the Champions Cup is not ideal.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/06/aaron-smith-new-zealand-apology-disabled-toilet-female-friend\">New Zealand\u2019s Aaron Smith sorry for \u2018huge mistake\u2019 after toilet encounter</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Saracens open their defence of the Champions Cup a week on Saturday at Toulon, winners of the tournament for the three previous seasons. \u201cWe normally have a two-week preparation before our opening game in Europe, working hard in the first and tapering off in the second,\u201d said McCall. \u201cWe were not able to do that this week because so many players were away. I understand England need time with their squad, but we would have preferred it to happen after the two European rounds. It seems madness to me that we are playing Wasps [the Premiership leaders] this Sunday and, at a time when everyone is talking about player welfare, our England internationals have had a tough Monday and Tuesday. We have had to be careful with them since they returned and that compromises your preparations, unless you are mad.\u201d</p> <p>The club\u2019s England second row George Kruis did not train on Thursday because of a back strain, but the outside-half Owen Farrell, who has not played since the summer tour to Australia because of back and hip problems, took part for 45 minutes. \u201cIt is a case of when he can do all the things he needs to,\u201d said McCall. \u201cThen he will play, but while he is kicking out of hand he has not place-kicked yet and I do not know if he will be ready for Toulon.\u201d</p>",

So we have a choice \u2013 retreat into old, closed-off economies or press forward, acknowledging the inequality that can come with globalisation while committing ourselves to making the global economy work better for all people, not just those at the top.\u201d </p> <p>In an election year characterised by a wave of anti-trade sentiment from Trump and Democratic primary contender Bernie Sanders, Obama contends that globalisation has been by far a net positive for the American economy.</p> <p>\u201cLifting productivity and wages also depends on creating a global race to the top in rules for trade,\u201d Obama contends. \u201cWhile some communities have suffered from foreign competition, trade has helped our economy much more than it has hurt. Exports helped lead us out of the recession. American firms that export pay their workers up to 18% more on average than companies that do not, according to a report by my Council of Economic Advisers.\u201d<br></p> <p>Clinton has joined Trump and Sanders in speaking out against the TPP, although some analysts suspect that, should she win the presidency, she will seek to repackage the deal in a manner that allows her to approve it. Obama pledges to keep pushing for Congress to pass the TPP because, he says, it will level the playing field for workers and businesses.</p> <p>In an obvious swipe at Trump, Obama writes of the current air of discontent: \u201cThe anti-immigrant, anti-Mexican, anti-Muslim and anti-refugee sentiment expressed by some Americans today echoes nativist lurches of the past \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.loc.gov/rr/program/bib/ourdocs/Alien.html\">the Alien and Sedition Acts of 1798</a>, the Know-Nothings of the mid-1800s, the anti-Asian sentiment in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and any number of eras in which Americans were told they could restore past glory if they just got some group or idea that was threatening America under control. We overcame those fears and we will again.\u201d</p> <p>But he acknowledges that some of the unrest is rooted in \u201clegitimate concerns\u201d about decades of declining productivity growth and rising inequality resulting in slower income growth for low- and middle-income families. The financial crisis of 2008 only seemed to increase the isolation of corporations and elites.</p> <p>\u201cSo it\u2019s no wonder that so many are receptive to the argument that the game is rigged. But amid this understandable frustration, much of it fanned by politicians who would actually make the problem worse rather than better, it is important to remember that capitalism has been the greatest driver of prosperity and opportunity the world has ever known.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/03/2016-economy-donald-trump-hillary-clinton-reagan\">Back to the future: economy becomes battle between Reagan and Bill Clinton</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Clinton is attempting a broad church election campaign that embraces some ideas from Sanders, <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2015/10/13/sanders-democratic-debate-bernie-sanders-democratic-socialist-5.cnn\">a self-proclaimed socialist</a>, but also has the centrist Obama as a leading surrogate. During an electrifying primary campaign, Sanders argued for the breakup of the Wall Street banks. But the president urges against quick fix solutions. </p> <p>\u201cFurther progress requires recognising that America\u2019s economy is an enormously complicated mechanism,\u201d he writes. \u201cAs appealing as some more radical reforms can sound in the abstract \u2013 breaking up all the biggest banks or erecting prohibitively steep tariffs on imports \u2013 the economy is not an abstraction. It cannot simply be redesigned wholesale and put back together again without real consequences for real people.\u201d</p> <p>Obama does, however, devote a section of the essay to widening inequality \u2013 a key theme of Sanders and Massachusetts <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/eugene-robinson-elizabeth-warren-makes-the-case-on-income-inequality/2014/10/20/ba54c68e-588a-11e4-8264-deed989ae9a2_story.html?utm_term=.36595d694337\">senator Elizabeth Warren</a> \u2013 and its negative economic and moral consequences. In 1979, he says, the top 1% of American families received 7% of all after-tax income; by 2007, that share had more than doubled to 17%.<br></p> <p>\u201cThis challenges the very essence of who Americans are as a people. We don\u2019t begrudge success, we aspire to it and admire those who achieve it. In fact, we\u2019ve often accepted more inequality than many other nations because we are convinced that with hard work, we can improve our own station and watch our children do even better.\u201d</p> <p>He cites technology, education, globalisation, declining unions and a falling minimum wage as factors in growing inequality. \u201cBut I believe that changes in culture and values have also played a major role. In the past, differences in pay between corporate executives and their workers were constrained by a greater degree of social interaction between employees at all levels \u2013 at church, at their children\u2019s schools, in civic organisations.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s why CEOs took home about 20 to 30 times as much as their average worker. The reduction or elimination of this constraining factor is one reason why today\u2019s CEO is now paid over 250 times more.\u201d</p> <p>He urges the next occupant of the White House: \u201cIn the future, we need to be even more aggressive in enacting measures to reverse the decades-long rise in inequality. Unions should play a critical role. They help workers get a bigger slice of the pie but they need to be flexible enough to adapt to global competition.\u201d</p> <p>He also calls for increasing the federal minimum wage, expanding the Earned Income Tax Credit for workers without dependent children and limiting tax breaks for high-income households.</p> <p>Obama further notes that in 1953, just 3% of men between 25 and 54 years old were out of the workforce. Today, it is 12%. In 1999, 23% of prime-age women were out of the workforce. Today, it is 26%.</p> <p>\u201cInvoluntary joblessness takes a toll on life satisfaction, self-esteem, physical health and mortality. It is related to a devastating rise of opioid abuse and an associated increase in overdose deaths and suicides among non-college-educated Americans \u2013 the group where labour-force participation has fallen most precipitously.\u201d</p> <p>Obama proposes increasing access to community colleges and providing wage insurance to those workers who cannot find a job that pays as well as their previous one. He says paid leave and guaranteed sick leave would also encourage flexibility that could lead to more people working. </p> <p>Championing the achievements of his eight-year presidency, led by preventing the 2008 financial crisis from turning into a great depression, Obama says a foundation was laid for a better future. He suggests that the US should prepare for negative shocks to the economy before they occur and not have to fight for emergency measures in a time of need.</p> <p>\u201cAmerica must stay committed to working with all nations to build stronger and more prosperous economies for all our citizens for generations to come,\u201d he writes. </p>",

  "<p>Journalism has always had an ambivalent relationship with respectability. The noblest ambition of the press is to hold power to account on behalf of the powerless, which means behaving in a way that sustains the trust of a wide audience while sometimes upsetting those in authority. If newspapers never caused controversy they would not be doing their job properly. If they are deemed to be routinely scurrilous their authority is&#xa0;diminished.</p> <p>Sometimes pursuit of the truth will lead journalists to deploy subterfuge. When breaching walls of official secrecy, for example, the greater good might even be served by breaking the law. But the decision to embark on that path is, or should be, felt as an acute ethical dilemma requiring examination of conscience and the highest standard of public interest.</p> <p>That test was not met by Mazher Mahmood, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/oct/05/fake-sheikh-mazher-mahmood-tulisa-contostavlos-trial\" title=\"\">convicted on Wednesday</a> of perverting the course of justice in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2014/aug/02/tulisa-contostavlos-fake-sheikh-simon-hattenstone\" title=\"\">trial of Tulisa Contostavlos</a> \u2013 a pop star inveigled into offering to broker a drug deal by the Sun on Sunday\u2019s star investigative reporter. Mahmood and his driver, Alan Smith, were found to have conspired in the revision of a police statement, excising information that might have helped Ms Contostavlos\u2019s defence. (The case against her collapsed.) This is the opposite of pursuing the truth, the antithesis of decent journalism. Inevitably, questions are being raised about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/oct/05/new-corp-20-lawsuits-fake-sheikh-conviction\" title=\"\">other convictions</a> secured on the basis of Mahmood\u2019s evidence and cavalier methodology. The case also invites <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/oct/05/met-police-accused-of-ignoring-warnings-on-fake-sheikh\" title=\"\">scrutiny of police</a> who appear to have sought prosecutions based on a standard of investigative rigour below that which they would expect of fellow officers. The glamour attached to a trial with a celebrity defendant appears to have trumped prosecutorial diligence.</p> <p>Mahmood built his career as the \u201cFake Sheikh\u201d of Sunday tabloid stings in the grey area between that which is in the public interest and that which interests the public. That distinction is not often interrogated enough in newsrooms when handling a \u201cgood\u201d story, which might be a commercial judgment before it is an ethical one. In that sense, the techniques involved are a secondary to the purpose of the investigation. The Independent Press Standards Organisation makes it clear in the <a href=\"https://www.ipso.co.uk/editors-code-of-practice/\" title=\"\">editors\u2019 code of practice</a> that misrepresentation, subterfuge and clandestine recording \u2013 Mahmood\u2019s modus operandi \u2013 are to be shunned whenever alternative means of procuring information are possible, and permissible only in the public interest.</p> <p>There are times when corruption has been uncovered that could only have been exposed by a reporter pretending to be something else. The stung party there needs little sympathy. But there is another genre of investigation that involves the reporter using a financial inducement and alcohol to pester targets into doing something sensational when there is no reason to believe they would have broken the law without provocation \u2013 a kind of aggravated entrapment. That appears to have been the scenario in the Contostavlos case and some others. In that way, Mahmood proved only that people are not perfect and can be manipulated into making bad decisions. This is not news.</p> <p>Perhaps the saddest aspect of this is the squandering of resources and goodwill. Proper investigative journalism is a painstaking, costly and sometimes risky business that fulfils an important function in the relationship between a democracy and its media. There is no shortage of places where Mahmood\u2019s capabilities might have been deployed to expose real wrongdoing. Closed circles of the rich and powerful sometimes need to be penetrated by devious methods to uncover abuse. But the unwritten permission to do that is itself a source of power that is corroded when abused.</p> <p>No media organisation can afford to be pious or complacent about its status as a gatekeeper of public standards. Mistrust of journalism has spread in tandem with declining faith in politics. The \u201cmainstream media\u201d is often now cast as an institutional cog in an elitist machine, regardless of journalism\u2019s self-image as a check on the establishment. And while changes in technology, the way news is consumed and public attitudes make for an ever more challenging commercial environment, the underlying ethics of the trade are remarkably constant.

But it might be useful to enlarge the understanding of education that is being discussed. Yes, graduates are more likely to vote in ways that are identified with left/liberal politics but there is a bigger question about the experience, as much as that of success within it, of education that demands examination. In the past 20 years everyone at any stage of education in the UK has been taught within a context of rigorous forms of measurement, in which lines between success and failure are increasingly visible and important. At the same time the links between the education system and the often poorly and narrowly conceived demands of the economy have become ever more explicit \u2013 so much so that to \u201cfail\u201d in education carries with it a&#xa0;social message of both collective and individual irrelevance. These relationships are becoming increasingly clear to millions of people, as are the more minimal gains that some forms of education can provide.

  "<p>To the outsider, jazz can seem less like a living form of music than a set of signifiers: music played to an older audience, aware of its own history, redolent of the cool of a half-remembered, semi-fictionalised past. Dig a little further, and a different set of signifiers emerge: \u201cdifficult\u201d music, often improvised, played in small clubs, to audiences of chin-stroking beardies. What the word \u201cjazz\u201d rarely summons is the idea of music that isn\u2019t just perfectly of the moment, but helping to shape and influence groundbreaking artists in other genres. But that\u2019s what it has become, thanks to a new generation of jazz musicians for whom working across disciplines is as natural as improvising in front of hardcore fans.</p> <p>As the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/dec/09/best-albums-of-2015-no-8-the-epic-by-kamasi-washington\">Los Angeles saxophonist Kamasi Washington</a> puts it: \u201cWe\u2019ve now got a whole generation of jazz musicians who have been brought up with hip-hop. We\u2019ve grown up alongside rappers and DJs, we\u2019ve heard this music all our life. We are as fluent in J Dilla and Dr Dre as we are in Mingus and Coltrane.\u201d</p> <p>The influence cuts both ways \u2013 from jazz to hip-hop and back again. Jazz musicians have always improvised over different rhythms but, if you go to a jazz gig these days, you\u2019re likely to hear a lot of musicians playing over <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqBPCBwc_cw\">the \u201cslugging\u201d beat</a> popularised by the hip-hop producer J Dilla. It\u2019s that <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DkM0Zlsmmg\">wonky, slightly drunken-sounding funk beat</a> that seems to have joined the arsenal of rhythms used by jazz musicians, alongside such mainstays as swing, bossa nova and the jazz waltz. \u201cIt\u2019s basically the sound of someone sampling a funk beat on an Akai MPC sampler and editing it wrong,\u201d says Rob Turner, drummer in the Mercury-nominated <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/feb/11/gogo-penguin-man-made-object-review-blue-note\">Manchester jazz trio Go Go Penguin</a>. \u201cInstead of starting the sample at the \u2018transient\u2019 \u2013 the start of the beat \u2013 it starts fractionally after that point. So the snare drums and hi-hats are all in slightly the wrong place. It sounds sluggish and disjointed and slightly screwed up, but it also sounds quite cool. And it\u2019s something that young jazz drummers have worked out how to play. Go around music colleges and you\u2019ll hear student drummers dividing up a bar into countless subdivisions and working how to \u2018slug\u2019 fluently \u2013 somewhere between \u2018swung\u2019 crotchets and \u2018straight\u2019 crotchets. Nowadays, so many young jazz drummers have learned to play like that we\u2019ve started to call it the \u2018college beat\u2019. It shows you how jazz musicians have thoroughly internalised the hip-hop they\u2019ve grown up with.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLRFswb167Y\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/OLRFswb167Y?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Hip-hop\u2019s love affair with jazz goes back more than 30 years, when the likes of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfvJAcou96s\">Stetsasonic</a>, Gang Starr, A Tribe Called Quest and Jungle Brothers were sampling heavily from jazz records and explicitly drawing connections between the two African-American art forms. Rappers such as the Notorious BIG (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/aug/03/notorious-big-secret-jazz-education\">who was mentored by the New Orleans saxophonist Donald Harrison</a>), Nas (the son of jazz musician Olu Dara) and Rakim (who studied the saxophone) have talked about how jazz influenced their phrasing and diction. However, when jazz musicians such as Herbie Hancock, Miles Davis, Branford Marsalis and Roy Ayers reciprocated, they always did so as curious outsiders: as \u201ctourists\u201d rather than native speakers. Younger jazz musicians, however, treat things differently.</p> <p>Washington has become the poster boy of this bilingual generation. Not only is his own spacey hard bop outfit filling out festivals and concert halls around the world \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b07qbzbn\">including a recent Prom</a> \u2013 but he has also worked closely with hip-hop musicians, working as the musical director for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/dec/18/best-albums-of-2015-no-1-to-pimp-a-butterfly-by-kendrick-lamar\">Kendrick Lamar\u2019s album To Pimp a Butterfly</a>, the landmark 2015 album whose stellar cast also included trumpeter Ambrose Akinmusire, guitarist Keith Askey, bassist Chris Smith, drummer Robert Searight and producer<a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/terrace-martin-music\"> Terrace Martin</a> \u2013 all of whom have worked in the worlds of jazz, R&amp;B and hip-hop.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jul/08/is-jazz-entering-a-new-golden-age\">Is jazz entering a new golden age?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cA lot of us grew up playing with Snoop Dogg\u2019s band, the Snoopadelics,\u201d Washington says. \u201cAnd we all played in big bands and jazz quartets and so on. I never had a problem moving between jazz and hip-hop. People like to compartmentalise music, especially African-American music, but it\u2019s really one thing. One very wide thing. I mean, it\u2019s like all those great records by Marvin Gaye and James Brown back in the day \u2013 there are tonnes of jazz musicians playing on them. When I first played some Coltrane-type stuff on the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/dec/18/best-albums-of-2015-no-1-to-pimp-a-butterfly-by-kendrick-lamar\">Pimp a Butterfly</a> sessions, Kendrick got it immediately. \u2018I want it to sound like it\u2019s on fire,\u2019 he\u2019d say. That\u2019s the kind of common ground that the best jazz and the best hip-hop have.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a tendency for the old guard to sneer at hip-hop,\u201d says Robert Glasper, the pianist who also featured on To Pimp a Butterfly. \u201cBut jazz can learn so much from hip-hop. I\u2019m reminded of how Miles Davis, when recording <a href=\"https://play.spotify.com/album/0tbR9i5NTey4b0QZxZ3xa2?play=true&amp;utm_source=open.spotify.com&amp;utm_medium=open\">Miles Smiles</a>, told [pianist] Herbie Hancock to not use his left hand at all. It made Herbie approach playing in a different way \u2013 he couldn\u2019t play chords, so it forced him to find other ways to express himself. And it\u2019s the same when you\u2019re working in the world of hip-hop. You have to use repetition, you have to play sounds that cut through. Sometimes that can be even more difficult than the most complicated improvisation.</p> <p>\u201cIf you want to create a great breakbeat, for instance, there is a sonic language and a feel that you have to understand. For instance, you can\u2019t do it with an 18-inch bass drum [the standard size for jazz drummers]. You need one with a 20- or 22-inch diameter. You have to tune your snare drum differently. You can\u2019t crash your cymbals every eight bars. Instead of adding fills, you have to remove components of that beat, or add juddering bass beats. And so on. If you\u2019re not a hip-hop head, you won\u2019t know that something\u2019s wrong. The jazz musicians who have grown up with hip-hop, however, know this implicitly.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Mx5rZFAm0g\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/_Mx5rZFAm0g?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>You\u2019ll find dozens of examples of this from young jazz musicians in their 20s and 30s.

That is always crucial.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9c8fc35cca14615f5f0df71932a47d8939992bc3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9c8fc35cca14615f5f0df71932a47d8939992bc3/0_359_3358_4198/800.jpg\" alt=\"Shabaka Hutchings.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Shabaka Hutchings.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Speaking nearly 20 years ago, the British saxophonist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2013/nov/17/courtney-pine-jazz-music-saxophone\">Courtney Pine</a> once remarked, in frustration, that jazz musicians would often enthuse about their love of funk, reggae or punk in private but never mention it professionally. \u201cPut them in front of a camera or a journalist,\u201d he said, \u201cand they\u2019d talk about Art Blakey and Duke Ellington, but they\u2019d clam up if you asked them about Burning Spear or Diana Ross. They were ashamed of that side of their musical formation! And I think it\u2019s why some jazz music stagnated.\u201d</p> <p>That seems to have changed . \u201cThe generation that emerged in the 1980s had to be a bit like that,\u201d says London-born saxophonist <a href=\"http://www.shabakahutchings.com/\">Shabaka Hutchings</a>. \u201cGuys like Wynton Marsalis were young players who were keen to be taken seriously by an older generation of jazz musicians, and keen to assert that jazz was a high art form. Mentioning reggae or hip-hop might seem to dilute that commitment. So you ended up with a somewhat dogmatic genre, one that was quite self-contained.</p> <p>\u201cThe difference now is that my generation don\u2019t feel the need to solely identify ourselves with one genre. We\u2019ve grown up with rave and electronica and hip-hop, and have no qualms about integrating that into our music. And those artists who have collaborated with Kendrick Lamar are perfect examples of that.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drV0QatqbRU\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/drV0QatqbRU?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>To Pimp a Butterfly was certainly on the radar of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jan/11/obituary-david-bowie\">David Bowie</a> and the jazz musicians with whom he recorded his final album.</p> <p>\u201cIt was an album that David talked about a lot, both with me and with producer Tony Visconti,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/oct/04/donny-mccaslin-david-bowie-blackstar-interview\">says saxophonist Donny McCaslin</a>, the musical director of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jan/07/david-bowie-blackstar-review-a-spellbinding-break-with-his-past\">Blackstar</a>. \u201cIt is a staggering piece of art. And oddly, I found Kendrick\u2019s rapping \u2013 his intonation, his rhythms, his syncopation, the spirit of his phrasing \u2013 heavily influenced my own saxophone playing, both on Blackstar and on my new album. David was very much intrigued by a musician like Kendrick who was creating a personal vision: something that was a mix of many genres, but not really sounding like any of them. I guess it\u2019s something that he has always done. I mean, what is Blackstar? It\u2019s not a jazz record or a rock record, it was David\u2019s personal vision. And it\u2019s the same with To Pimp a Butterfly.\u201d</p> <p>Blackstar producer Tony Visconti has suggested that only jazz musicians could keep up with Bowie during his most creative moments. \u201cThat\u2019s very kind of Tony to say that,\u201d says McCaslin, with a laugh. \u201cBut, with David, the collaboration was very organic. He has been a big fan of jazz since he was a teenager \u2013 he\u2019d talk about how he was obsessed with Stan Kenton and Gil Evans and Charlie Parker and Maria Schneider and whatnot. And he was comfortable in a jazz setting. It was like we were a four-man basketball team and he was the fifth member who fitted in seamlessly. Because that\u2019s what jazz musicians do \u2013 one guy plays something, another hears that and moves in a different direction, a third covers for them both, and so on. And David was always in the heart of the action, a participant among these jazz musicians.</p> <p>\u201cI was doing a joint interview with Tony around the release of Blackstar, and he observed that jazz had always been present in David\u2019s music \u2013 it\u2019s just that it had always been a deeply embedded component. My own band have been exploring his catalogue and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RgEIAlN15A\">have started playing a few Bowie songs in our live sets</a>, as a tribute \u2013 Warszawa, Look Back in Anger, Hello Spaceboy, A Small Plot Of Land, as well as Lazarus. There is a lot of interesting harmonic information, a lot of interesting intervals. As a jazz musician, they are very satisfying to play.\u201d</p> <p>Again, McCaslin\u2019s own music draws as much from hip-hop and contemporary music as it does from jazz. His new album, Beyond Now, features versions of songs by Aphex Twin, MuteMath and deadmau5, while there\u2019s a rhythmic sensibility that comes from being immersed in music by the likes of Squarepusher and Skrillex.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qGigIMM1Vw\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/8qGigIMM1Vw?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>What is astonishing about all of these jazz musicians is the sheer number of radically different projects in which they are involved. Since finishing Blackstar, McCaslin has recorded his own new album, toured with Mike Manieri\u2019s fusion band Steps Ahead and found time to play with Maria Schneider\u2019s big band. Glasper has, in the past year alone, soundtracked <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/apr/21/miles-ahead-review-magnificent-mooch-through-the-wilderness-years\">Don Cheadle\u2019s recent Miles Ahead</a> movie and a Nina Simone biography, put together a Miles Davis tribute with assorted singers and released a new album of soul-jazz covers, ArtScience. He is also co-producing Herbie Hancock\u2019s upcoming album.</p> <p>Hutchings seems to be taking more work than even McCaslin and Glasper. As well as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/apr/01/the-comet-is-coming-psych-jazz-sun-ra-legacy\">Comet Is Coming</a> \u2013 his Mercury-nominated collaboration with ravey synth-and-drums duo Soccer96 \u2013 he fronts his futuristic marching band, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/oct/08/sons-of-kemet-lest-we-forget-what-we-came-here-to-do-review\">Sons of Kemet</a>, and leads a new collaboration with a group of South African jazz musicians called the Ancestors. And that\u2019s not to mention his work with the jazz-punk outfit Melt Yourself Down, the DJ/producer Floating Points, the hip-hop-influenced trio Thousand Kings, the Sun Ra Orchestra or the Sun Ra-influenced Heliocentrics.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5175d4ef25fe9120813be1ca8a7d3257460cc7fe\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5175d4ef25fe9120813be1ca8a7d3257460cc7fe/0_223_5400_3240/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Flying Lotus.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Flying Lotus.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Van Breukelen/Redferns</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIt\u2019s just a function of growing up liking lots of different music,\u201d he says. \u201cBe it bashment or hip-hop, or Bj\u00f6rk or Antony and the Johnsons, or Fela Kuti or Thomas Mapfumo. And all that influences how you approach jazz. With the Comet Is Coming, for instance, we play in much clubbier venues than we might with Sons of Kemet. You see how stand-up audiences respond to certain rhythms, and that takes you in a certain direction.</p> <p>\u201cWhat I always find frustrating is that so many jazz musicians have forgotten how to write decent melodies. They are often so keen to show off their chops and their harmonic knowledge that they forget how to connect to an audience. That\u2019s something that pisses me off. In fact, it was working with the Ethiopian musician Mulatu Astatke that really gave me the confidence to play simple, strong melodies \u2013 drawing from folkloric music. That\u2019s something that all jazz musicians can benefit from.\u201d</p> <p>What seems to unite many of this new generation is the idea that jazz is less a genre and more a sensibility. \u201cThe thing that keeps jazz from being old is the fact that you can apply it to where you\u2019re at,\u201d says Thundercat. \u201cBeing a jazz musician is a mentality as well as an ability.

It comes weeks after the Prime Minister\u2019s own talks with Wall Street bankers and is the latest in a series of international visits from UK ministers in an attempt to allay fears over Brexit and drum up support for new trade. Although previously met with scepticism due to the uncertainty surrounding the UK\u2019s exit from the EU, Hammond\u2019s visit will be the first since the likelihood of a \u2018hard\u2019 Brexit by early 2017 was confirmed. </p> <p>The Chancellor is expected to tell Wall Street that the UK is still a financial hub for global business. The challenge he will face will be in reassuring banks that the UK is indeed still a safe-bet investment in a week that has seen the pound plunge to a new three decade low against the dollar on the prospect of \u2018hard\u2019 Brexit and businesses within the City of London warn that it could cost the city \u00a338 billion.

That could be compounded by a drop in physical exports, depending on the trade terms that Britain agrees with the rest of the world.</p> <p>Desmond Lachman, a resident fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, fears that the current account deficit will get even worse, pushing the pound down. He writes:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There appear to be at least two reasons to believe that market fears about the consequences of a hard Brexit for continued large capital flows to the UK are not misplaced. The first is that, were the UK no longer to have ready access to Europe\u2019s single market for its exports, it would lose its attractiveness as a location for foreign companies\u2019 European investments. This was precisely the point that the Japanese government made at the September G20 meeting in China \u2013 when it publicly warned its UK counterparts of the likelihood that Japanese companies would relocate out of the UK in the event of a hard Brexit.</p> <p>The second reason is that a hard Brexit would almost certainly result in the loss of the \u2018financial passport\u2019 that City of London financial institutions currently enjoy for accessing the European market. A Financial Conduct Authority report in September suggested that as many as 5,500 UK financial firms could be affected by such a loss of passport rights. Major international banks including JP Morgan Chase and Goldman Sachs have warned that, if the City loses its financial passport, they will need to conduct at least part of their European operations from outside the UK.</p> <p>A key point that those in favour of a hard Brexit overlook is that a rapid drying up of foreign capital flows to the UK would have dire consequences for domestic living standards. A further currency dip would raise import costs and increase inflation. Moreover, there is a likelihood that domestic economic policy would need to be tightened \u2013 both to contain inflation and to make room for a large narrowing in the external current account deficit that foreigners would no longer be prepared to finance.

  "<p>Theresa May dropped a bombshell in her keynote speech to the Conservative conference this week when she said there had been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/05/theresa-may-consigns-cameron-to-history-in-populist-speech\">undesirable side-effects </a>from the ultra-low interest rates and money creation that have been part of the economic landscape for the past seven years.</p> <p>Noting that the spoils of the growth generated by these unconventional policies had been unevenly divided, May said the approach had boosted asset prices, which helped the better off much more than it did those struggling to get by. \u201cA change is going to come and we are going to deliver it,\u201d the prime minister said.</p> <p>That was the cue for a flurry of speculation. Was this a signal to the Bank of England not to cut interest rates when it next meets in November? Was May about to send <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/mark-carney\">Mark Carney</a> back to Canada? Was she rethinking the wisdom of Gordon Brown\u2019s decision, taken in the first week of Tony Blair\u2019s 1997 government, to grant the Bank independence?</p> <p>Clarification was called for, and it was quickly provided. The government said it had no intention of meddling with the Bank\u2019s independence and the chancellor, Philip Hammond, went out of his way on Thursday to praise Carney \u2013 widely thought to have done well during the immediate chaos following the Brexit vote \u2013 while on a visit to Wall Street.</p> <p>That was sensible. With the pound hitting fresh <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/oct/06/pound-sterling-chancellor-hammond-wall-street-charm-offensive-business-live\">31-year-lows</a> every day this week and some analysts talking about a sterling crisis, it is not a great idea to suggest to financial markets that you are thinking about defenestrating the governor of your central bank.</p> <p>So what did May really mean? What sort of change can we expect?</p> <p>Put simply, the prime minister was expressing doubts about the macroeconomic strategy George Osborne pursued. The previous chancellor, whom she sacked in July, believed the Bank of England should bear the responsibility for generating sufficient demand in the economy via its control over interest rates and quantitative easing (QE).</p> <p>Fiscal policy \u2013 the Treasury\u2019s tax and spending decisions \u2013 would, by contrast be kept tight in order to repair the damage to the public finances caused by the deep recession of 2008-09.</p> <p>Economists argued from the outset about whether the mix was right, with some calling for tighter monetary policy balanced by less austerity.</p> <p>The results of Osborne\u2019s approach were not especially impressive. Britain\u2019s recovery from recession was sluggish, and deficit reduction was much slower than planned. <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Documents/news/2012/nr073.pdf\">A Bank of England study</a> showed that QE did help to boost activity, but that the benefits tended to go to the richest 5%, who own 40% of the UK\u2019s assets. The money created by QE did more to boost asset prices than it did the real economy.</p> <p>May\u2019s misgivings were echoed by the International Monetary Fund this week. The IMF thinks monetary policy is being asked to do too much, and that the continued use of unconventional measures, long after they were expected to be phased out, is hurting bank profitability and could result in solvency problems for pension funds and insurance companies. The Bank for International Settlements thinks the same.</p> <p>As to what May will do, she has two main options. First, if the Bank wants to do any more QE it will have to secure the Treasury\u2019s permission. That could legitimately be refused without impairing the Bank\u2019s independence. Second, Hammond could change the mix by easing fiscal policy in his autumn statement. That would make the need for more QE redundant and reduce the need for further interest rate cuts. </p>",
  "<p>This past August <a href=\"https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/sotc/\">marked</a> 16 straight months of record-breaking high temperatures globally. The planet is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/03/global-temperature-climate-change-highest-115000-years\">hotter right now</a> than it has been in 115,000 years. Nasa makes very easy-to-understand videos that show the decrease in the polar ice caps in the Arctic Circle, which is warming <a href=\"http://globalnews.ca/news/2893850/nasa-releases-video-of-melting-polar-ice-caps/\">twice as fast</a> as the rest of the world. More than <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/05/science/climate-change-poll-pew.html?_r=0\">90%</a> of the world\u2019s climate scientists say that the planet is warming and human activity is the cause. </p> <p>Amazingly, lots of people still don\u2019t believe them. <a href=\"http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/many-more-republicans-now-believe-in-climate-change/\">Less than half</a> of all Republicans polled this year by Yale and George Mason universities think that the climate is changing at all.</p> <p>What is going with on with these people? Kirsti Jylha, a psychology professor at Sweden\u2019s Upsala University, recently <a href=\"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/10/161004103313.htm\">published</a> a thesis in the scientific journal Personality and Individual Differences that sketches a profile of a standard climate change denier. Jylha\u2019s studies found that climate change denial correlates strongly with conservative political orientation, authoritarian attitudes and support for the status quo. </p> <p>Deniers tend to exhibit a low capacity for empathy and a high aptitude for dominance. They\u2019re predisposed to closed-mindedness and seeing the world in a hierarchical structure, and they avoid experiencing negative emotions. Perhaps not surprisingly, they are usually male.</p> <p>Since climate change denial hampers efforts towards the collective worldwide action scientists believe will be required to ward off the most catastrophic results of global warming, Jylha hopes that her work can lead to new routes of communication and cooperation.</p> <p>\u201cThe arguments used in the climate debate often revolve around giving up conveniences in life to help the environment or the poor or weak,\u201d Jylha told Science Daily. \u201cBut that is maybe not a convincing argument to someone who sees the world from a hierarchical viewpoint. It would perhaps be better to talk in other terms and describe how everyone will benefit from the measures instead of being affected by the consequences and that the measures don\u2019t have to be a threat to the current societal structure.\u201d</p> <p>In other words: how can we more effectively talk stubborn, closed-minded jerks into helping to solve (and/or, at the very least, stop worsening) the world\u2019s most dangerous problem? Following Jylha\u2019s lead, I\u2019ve come up with a few conversation starters, to use in the appropriate situations, custom-designed to ease the climate denier in your neighborhood into taking measures that might just do our imperilled planet some good. </p> <p>You notice the guy \u2013 pot-bellied, bad hair, fake tan, tiny fingers, we\u2019ll call him \u201cDonald\u201d \u2013 pulling his SUV out of his driveway to head into work. Try this: <em>hey Donald</em>, you mouth, indicating he should roll down his driver\u2019s side window. </p> <p>When he does, you go on. \u201cHave you ever considered car pooling? If you were to give a couple of your colleagues a ride to work in this huge car of yours, you could dominate conversation for the whole hourlong drive<em>.\u201d</em></p> <p>A week later, casually mention that you\u2019re thinking about buying a Prius. Suggest he consider getting one himself. \u201cA nice small car like that would make your tiny fingers look comparatively bigger on the steering wheel.\u201d</p> <p>One afternoon, when you see him out riding his lawnmower in the yard of his McMansion, ask about the dividing line between his property and that of his other neighbor, Mike. \u201cYou should plant some trees all along the fence,\u201d you might tell him. \u201cI suppose Mike might get his knickers all up in a bunch, if you were to do it, say, without consulting him first.

  "<p>From the start of the new century, the Crusades have gained more intense contemporary resonance than for many centuries past. Jonathan Riley-Smith, who has died aged 78, was the subject\u2019s pre-eminent scholar, his research focusing on the beliefs that suddenly, at the end of the 11th century, prompted armies of westerners to attempt to conquer the Holy Land, and to pull off against apparently insurmountable odds what was seen as a miracle: a divine intervention in the affairs of the world comparable to the incarnation of Christ.</p> <p>What motivated thousands of well-heeled French, English, German and Italian laymen to walk away from their daily existences and risk everything, including life itself, at the other end of the known world? How did the papacy justify such a radical \u2013 indeed, subversive \u2013 innovation in terms of Christian theology? How was this extraordinary concatenation of ideas and events moulded into an institutional structure to sustain the territorial consequences of this transformation in geopolitics? How was it then deployed to legitimise Christian violence elsewhere?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"86bcd797ee435fa8f6955a251f5be01e414030bf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/86bcd797ee435fa8f6955a251f5be01e414030bf/4_3_609_777/392.jpg\" alt=\"Jonathan Riley-Smith was a founder member, and later president, of the Society for the History of the Crusades and the Latin East\" width=\"392\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jonathan Riley-Smith was a founder member, and later president, of the Society for the History of the Crusades and the Latin East</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: None</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Some German and French historians had addressed some of these questions, but Riley-Smith answered them with an unprecedented clarity and directness, founded on a far wider and more systematic reading of theology and canon law as well as of narrative sources and documents. His primary interest was always what people thought, whether the inchoate spiritual fervour of illiterate lay Crusaders, or the elaborate theological and legal contortions of popes and their advisers, or popularised versions of the latter, devised by Crusade preachers, which so successfully aroused the former. His devout Catholic faith gave him a clear insight into the mentality, but did not in any sense make him an apologist.</p> <p>For the first time in the middle ages, fighting \u2013 that quintessential lay aristocratic activity \u2013 ceased to be a sinful necessity in a fallen world, and became instead an expression of devoted and meritorious service to Christ as lord. It was an entrance ticket to heaven, issued by the pope on Christ\u2019s behalf.</p> <p>Crusading became a manifestation of lay piety, of Christian love, as the territory sanctified by Christ\u2019s terrestrial presence \u2013 Christ\u2019s very patrimony \u2013 was retaken from the infidel and defended in his name. The traditional metaphor of the monk as soldier fighting in Christ\u2019s cause through prayer was actualised.</p> <p>In my favourite Riley-Smith book \u2013 The First Crusade and the Idea of Crusading (1986) \u2013 he showed how the diffuse elements in the original proclamation of an armed pilgrimage by Pope Urban II in 1095 were fused and transformed in the aftermath of the taking of Jerusalem in 1099 by the historians who wrote accounts of the triumph of a lay monastery on the march. It was this interpretation that was adopted by subsequent popes. The First Crusaders, 1095-1131 (1997) meticulously tracked down every identifiable participant, and sought to reconstruct his likely motives.</p> <p>Riley-Smith\u2019s arguments had already been sketched out over a much longer timescale in his trenchant What Were the Crusades? (1977; 4th edition 2009), and in a seminal essay with the characteristically provocative title Crusading As an Act of Love (1980). The Knights of St John in Jerusalem and Cyprus, c.1050-1310 (1967; 2nd edition 2012) dealt with the subject of his doctoral research, the Knights of the Hospital of St John of Jerusalem, one of the orders of soldier monks that crusading engendered. The Feudal Nobility and the Kingdom of Jerusalem, 1174-1277 (1973; 2nd edition 2002) showed how the system of western feudal law was imported into the newly established kingdom of Jerusalem by the settler nobility.</p> <p>There were many more books on the same and similar themes, which tapped into the wider public interest that Riley-Smith had been a leading light in promoting. This August he launched <a href=\"http://crusades-regesta.com\" title=\"\">a massive internet calendar of the charters and other legal documents of the Latin East</a>.</p> <p>A founder member, and later president, of the Society for the History of the Crusades and the Latin East, he became familiar on television and radio. As director of studies in history at Queens\u2019 College, Cambridge (1972-78), he inspired some of us to become medievalists. From being professor of history at Royal Holloway, University of London (1978-94) he returned to Cambridge as professor of ecclesiastical history, at Emmanuel College (1994-2005).</p> <p>Born in Harrogate, he was the son of William Riley-Smith and his wife, Elspeth (nee Craik Henderson). The Riley-Smith family had prospered from its involvement in the Yorkshire firm of John Smith\u2019s Brewery. From Eton College, Jonathan went to Trinity College, Cambridge. As an undergraduate, he spent a lot of time at the racecourse at Newmarket, but less conventionally acquired for himself a copy of the massive 19th-century French edition of the crusading chroniclers. He had found his vocation.</p> <p>After graduating in 1960, he embarked on research. At the time, <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1372747/Sir-Steven-Runciman.html\" title=\"\">Sir Steven Runciman</a>\u2019s three-volume history of the Crusades, 1951-54, was the latest word, at least in Anglophone scholarship. Riley-Smith developed an approach that surpassed its mellifluous narrative, by focusing on what legitimated Crusades and motivated Crusaders. His first lecturing post was at the University of St Andrews (1964-72).</p> <p>As a companion, he was enthusiastic, forceful, funny, direct, sympathetic, perceptive, old-fashioned (he was forever enveloped in a miasma of pipe smoke, and latterly snuff) and courageous. He evinced a boundless generosity of spirit.</p> <p>In 1968 he married Louise Field, a portrait painter. She survives him, as do their children, Toby, Tammy and Polly.</p> <p>\u2022 Jonathan Simon Christopher Riley-Smith, historian, born 27 June 1938; died 13 September 2016</p>",

  "<p>In June last year, Chinese artist <a href=\"http://www.caiguoqiang.com/\">Cai Guo\u00ad-Qiang </a>lit the fuse on a 500-meter ladder of fire that rose above Huiyu Island Harbour, Quanzhou, in Fujian province. The ladder was the culmination of a childhood dream and more than 20 years of pyrotechnic ambition, having devised but failed to complete similar ladders in Bath, UK, in 1994; Shanghai in 2001; and in Los Angeles four years ago, when the attempt was shut down by authorities as a fire hazard.<br></p> <p>The New York-based artist claims in a new Netflix documentary about the making of Sky Ladder that \u201cthere is no success or failure in art\u201d. This final installment of the project was offered more in tenderness than abstraction or ceremonial grandeur. </p> <p>Days after the project completed, Guo\u00ad-Qiang\u2019s 100-year-old grandmother \u2013 with whom he maintained a close relationship stemming, at least, from his earliest experimentation with his established artistic medium, gunpowder \u2013 passed away. \u201cIt\u2019s important to know when to set the fire, but also important to know when to put it out,\u201d she once wisely advised him. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLTT8ogRf50\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/lLTT8ogRf50?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>\u201cThis project is one of those that I wanted to attempt since I was a young boy and wanted to touch the clouds,\u201d the softly spoken Guo\u00ad-Qiang told an audience in New York last night. \u201cI thought 500 meters could reach beyond the clouds to heaven.\u201d </p> <p>The documentary attempts a deeper explanation of Guo-Qiang\u2019s work. Few other Chinese artists have been so overtly willing to take on Chinese government-sponsored projects: he was named director of visual and special effects of the Beijing Olympics in 2008; and later put on a display for world leaders at the Apac conference. </p> <p>But while Sky Ladder was constructed and ignited without Chinese government approval, it was not intended as a political statement \u2013 avoiding official involvement was a matter of practicality rather than anything intrinsically political in the work itself. </p> <p>\u201cHis art is not political,\u201d explained documentary producer Wendi Deng Murdoch. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t want a political agenda. So he works with the Chinese officials, but he doesn\u2019t want his art to be political. He wants it to be enjoyable.\u201d </p> <p>Rupert Murdoch\u2019s former wife, lately <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/09/wendi-deng-burning-man\">reported</a> to be glamping with tech neo-hippies at Burning Man and holidaying with Ivanka Trump, has staged a high-profile, post-divorce comeback in the arena of arts and technology. </p> <p>\u201cI love art, I love China,\u201d Murdoch says, \u201cand I love fireworks because they mean good luck.\u201d</p> <p>Her relationship with the artist dates back almost 20 years. \u201cCai and I became good friends when we lived as neighbors in SoHo. He\u2019s really mastered the technique of making art with fireworks and to use gunpowder to make art so I wanted to show the world how wonderful he is, and to help people understand China better on a cultural level.\u201d<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>In the making of Sky Ladder, she explains, they avoided getting permits from the government not because Sky Ladder is itself political but because any large-scale project requires going through a frustrating bureaucratic process. The 400 or so islanders kept quiet about the preparations. </p> <p>\u201cDuring the making of the film you can\u2019t always get what you want, but that\u2019s not just in China,\u201d says Murdoch. \u201cIn Paris, when we did One Night Stand, you also have to get permits. It\u2019s not so easy.\u201d </p> <p>The documentary, directed by <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0531817/\">Kevin Macdonald</a>, does a serviceable job of explaining Guo-Qiang\u2019s background as an artist \u2013 his father was a calligrapher and the family were forced to burn their books at the start of the cultural revolution \u2013 but there\u2019s a disconnect that mirrors a dilemma in Guo-Qiang\u2019s work, namely: is the beauty of his momentary, staged firework spectacles enough? </p> <p>\u201cNo art is meant to be kept forever,\u201d he explains. \u201cSo I attempt to achieve a sense of eternal from the ephemeral.\u201d </p> <p>Though Sky Ladder may be complete, the artists said his \u201cjourney of trying to dialog with the unseen world does not stop\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cSky Ladder is No 20 in my series, Projects for Extraterrestrials.

If you pay you can get even a late abortion in a Polish hospital. Poor women often do not have access to medical examinations during pregnancy. They do not know until labor that their child is very sick. It is also difficult to buy contraception pills in small towns. Women in big cities like Cracow or Warsaw do not have these problems. </p> <p>People do not understand how this legislation would affect the lives of Polish families.

There have always been groups lobbying for a total abortion ban in Poland. That\u2019s nothing new. But currently the political climate is much more willing to consider them. </p> <p>What it\u2019s like to be a woman here depends on many factors from age group through to class, education, religious background, political affiliation and where you live. Women in Poland are not a homogeneous group. But the basic problem is that the very notion of women\u2019s rights is a novelty here. Women\u2019s rights are not obvious, they are not something one can take for granted. For many the concept itself is alien.</p> <p>Women in Poland do not have reproductive rights. What they do have - according to great many people - are reproductive obligations. Some will even call them sacred reproductive obligations. We have been seeing a war waged by the conservative circles including the Catholic church against what they call gender ideology. For many people here the very idea that biology is not destiny, that gender roles are social constructs and divinely ordained reality is difficult, if not impossible, to accept. This will take a very long time to change.<br><br>I think it will take a long time before the concept of women\u2019s rights, in particular women\u2019s reproductive rights, will become something as unquestionable as, say, the right to vote.<br><strong>Barbara, 39, B\u0142onie, near Warsaw</strong></p> <h2>\u2018Women\u2019s rights are still considered one of those leftist issues and feminists are called feminazis\u2019</h2> <p>I helped to organise the protests and I took part in previous protests in April. I had an abortion in 2014 in the UK, when contraception I was taking failed. I did not hesitate and would probably do that again. The sense of security when it comes to my reproductive rights is one of the reasons I am not going back to Poland. My friends who live in Poland sometimes ask if they could count on me if they got pregnant and wanted to get an abortion.</p> <p>I think it\u2019s sick that we cannot expect basic medical help in my country just because of the Catholic church. Abortion on demand was legal in Poland until 1993. My mother told me it was so obvious to people that it was accessible: when the parliament voted on the restrictive bill, nobody believed it would actually pass, because how could you just ban abortion. It was a great surprise when it passed.</p> <p>And the ridiculous thing about it is it does not reflect society\u2019s views. Yes, we have \u2018pro-life\u2019 or \u2018anti-choice\u2019 people in Poland and quite a lot of them. But women still get abortions, they just go abroad. In fact I know about women and young girls that tried to cause a miscarriage buy punching their bellies, running, excessive smoking and drinking, taking different mixtures of medications and other drastic measures.</p> <p>We do not have proper anti-discrimination laws, which means a prospective employer can freely ask during an interview whether you are planning to get pregnant any time soon. There are hardly regulations against mobbing and sexual harassment at work and men feel free to throw sexist jokes at their colleagues. I experienced them myself. Women\u2019s rights are still considered one of those leftist issues and feminists are called \u201cfeminazis\u201d.</p> <p>The only political party that has parities in their regulations is Razem, the social democrats, with every conference having an equal gender split when it comes to speakers.<br><strong>Mags, 31, a Polish citizen living in the UK since 2010</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ab9bff6adf4841da6258677ab9d1e7766d0b168f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ab9bff6adf4841da6258677ab9d1e7766d0b168f/0_0_3500_2643/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A woman looks on as she takes part in abortion rights campaigners\u2019 demonstration \u201cBlack Protest\u201d in front of the Parliament in Warsaw on 1 October\" width=\"1000\" height=\"755\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A woman looks on as she takes part in abortion rights campaigners\u2019 demonstration \u201cBlack Protest\u201d in front of the Parliament in Warsaw on 1 October.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kacper Pempel/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>\u2018Although the feminist movements are stronger than ever, we are still thought as less capable and weaker\u2019</h2> <p>The proposed legislation is really cruel. I have a hard time understanding why they would want to refuse us the right to have a choice. But there is more to that discussion than just a right to choose. <br><br>It\u2019s not about killing children but about basic dignity of a woman. No woman terminates a pregnancy unless she has good reason. We\u2019re smart, educated and probably most of us want to have kids at some point. If there is support, if the father of that child is there to help, if we have family around, even unwanted pregnancy is very unlikely to end up in abortion. It seems that everyone is forgetting that. </p> <p>As a person who has lived in various countries, I think being a woman in Poland is not any different than in other countries. Although the feminist movements are stronger than ever, we are still thought as less capable and weaker. But I experienced this in other countries too, especially as a woman in a typically male profession.<br><strong>Alo, 33, a Polish citizen living in Brussels</strong></p> <h2>\u2018I don\u2019t want to emigrate, but if the law will ever be stricter than it is now I will leave my country\u2019</h2> <p>I, and most of my friends, protested in various ways. We are afraid that the current government may force even stricter laws. We are also afraid that our health and life will be in hands of religious fanatics. Even at the moment it\u2019s really hard to find a hospital that isn\u2019t afraid to do abortions. <br></p> <p>At the places that do still help women with abortions it\u2019s really common that the anti-choice people demonstrate with banners showing bloody foetuses to scare doctors. In Subcarpathian Voivodeship there aren\u2019t any hospitals that do abortions so women have to travel to Warsaw or to Krak\u00f3w to terminate pregnancies. </p> <p>There is a real possibility that they will add to current legislation that foetuses with Down\u2019s syndrome are not severely damaged so pregnancies with those children won\u2019t be allowed to be terminated. <br></p> <p>Some women agree with the current law, but some like me want more liberal law. If women want to terminate healthy pregnancies they travel to Germany, Slovakia or buy pills online so in fact the law is discriminating against poor women who cannot afford that.<br><strong>Ola, 18, Warsaw</strong></p> <h2>\u2018Limiting rights of anyone is inhumane and leads to dangerous situations\u2019<br></h2> <p>There are people in Poland who, in my opinion, do not want to discuss or listen to anyone\u2019s views. They dismiss, laugh or ignore women and women\u2019s rights. Moreover, they do not tolerate anyone who disagrees with their point of view. These people support laws that lead to dictatorship. I strongly disagree with their views. </p> <p>Women of Poland are ambitious, hardworking, well educated, often open and tolerant. We are known of being very attached to our family and will go to any extent to secure the safety and well being of our families, especially our children. We are attached to our traditions and make our homes a castle. We are, on the other hand, ignored, dismissed and disrespected by men, by bosses (not only men), and by families.</p> <p>We women need to build and develop Poland together with men. I demand women\u2019s rights to be respected in my country. I was proud of being Polish and of Poland changing into a prosperous and tolerant country. It deeply saddens me to see this might no longer might be the case.<br><strong>Marta, 33, a Polish citizen living in the UK</strong></p>",
  "<p>With the dome of Brixton\u2019s Lambeth town hall looming in the background, a salt-and-pepper cropped fiftysomething, clad in a lurid dyed outfit and plastic red necklace, fixes his eyes just above the camera and launches into an impassioned rant: \u201cThe real people of this community are being forced out. The developers don\u2019t give a flying fuck; they don\u2019t have a social conscience. It\u2019s destroying whole families and communities. I\u2019m from Peckham \u2026 they\u2019re saying it\u2019s gonna become trendy like Brixton has become. Peckham has got the largest Nigerian community in London. What you see is what you get. There\u2019s no Costa fucking Coffee. Or Foxton\u2019s \u2026 Please. Don\u2019t. Make. Peckham. Trendy. Like. Brixton. Thank you.\u201d</p> <p>The man was speaking at the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/davehillblog/2015/apr/28/brixton-anti-gentrification-protest-reclaim-foxtons-estate-agent\" title=\"\">Reclaim Brixton demonstration</a>, which took place in south London in April 2015. Its organisers said that the event celebrated Brixton\u2019s cultural diversity (it is internationally known for its vibrant African-Caribbean communities) while aiding the fight against the exodus of locals because of rocketing house prices and the purging of smaller, individual businesses thanks to high rents and competition from incoming big business. On the night of the event, protesters smashed one huge glass front window of high-end estate agent Foxton\u2019s and daubed \u201cYuppies out\u201d on another. The explosive passions of the day reflected the thorniness of the issue: is it possible to \u201crejuvenate\u201d an area without stripping away its soul and displacing its natives? And how does one define gentrification anyway?</p> <p>The real-life footage of the Peckham man\u2019s interview appears midway through A Moving Image, the feature debut from <a href=\"https://sholaamoo.com/\" title=\"\">British-Nigerian film-maker Shola Amoo</a>. In the fictional world of Amoo\u2019s film, this footage is being captured by Nina (Tanya Fear), a young female actor who, tired of experiencing casual sexism in casting, has embarked on a new project: a visual-art piece about gentrification. It is inspired by her complex feelings about returning to the area after a long spell in hipster east London. Is she herself \u2013 young, arty, stylish \u2013 a gentrifier? Along the way, Nina strikes up a relationship of sorts with a pompous but politically engaged black performance artist, as well as a young, white working-class actor. She also comes under suspicion from a community leader wary of the barely researched nature of her project, and anti-gentrification activists who view her as a dilettante.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/03/police-called-brixton-anti-gentrification-protest-railway-arches\">Police called as council meeting hit by protests over Brixton's 'gentrification'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>For both director and star \u2013 who first collaborated on haunting sci-fi short <a href=\"http://www.okayafrica.com/film/shola-amoo-touch-film/\" title=\"\">Touch</a> (2013) \u2013 A Moving Image is a personal undertaking. Amoo was born in Guy\u2019s Hospital, Southwark, and spent his youth between Elephant and Castle, Peckham and Brixton. He still lives in Elephant and Castle, and says that seeing its rapid erosion of diversity and the destruction of community housing (the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2014/jun/04/is-demolition-ever-the-best-way-to-regenerate\" title=\"\">Heygate estate</a> for example) is what made him pursue the film, which was partially funded by \u00a34,782 raised on crowdfunding site IndieGogo. Fear, meanwhile, has lived in all four compass points of London.</p> <p>\u201cShola and I have been talking about this film\u2019s issues for several years,\u201d she says. \u201cHaving one of our many coffees in Brixton, we looked around us and it really hit home: this was not the place that we once knew. The character Nina is based on our producer Rienkje Attoh\u2019s experience of growing up in Brixton, leaving, and returning to a place she didn\u2019t recognise. We then begun to ponder this question, how are we as creatives implicated in the changing landscapes of our local communities?\u201d</p> <p>These knotty questions \u2013 what is the purpose of art? Can it really effect change? \u2013 give this occasionally vaporous film its backbone. \u201cI was questioning the value of art in the face of social trauma and the role of artists in the process of gentrification,\u201d says Amoo. \u201cI was aware of the potential hypocrisy that exists being an artist and making a film about gentrification \u2013 especially in our perceived role as being the first wave of gentrification. My immediate reaction was to think that my blackness protected me from any claim \u2013 but does it? I wanted to explore the nuance of blackness in the UK and it\u2019s unique relationship with art and class.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7511a5b71f5293dad7d0513de16b870fab02c9c9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7511a5b71f5293dad7d0513de16b870fab02c9c9/60_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"One of the locals in A Moving Image.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">One of the locals in A Moving Image.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR company handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In tackling these subjects, through the proxy of amateur film-maker Nina, Amoo throws traditional form out of the window, freely mixing fiction, documentary and performance art. \u201cIt became quite clear to me that a purely fictional narrative on gentrification wasn\u2019t going to be immersive enough \u2013 the real story was in the people I was meeting and the events taking place,\u201d says the director. \u201cI\u2019m in a constant dialogue about form, content and innovation, forever keeping in mind that mediums need to evolve to stay relevant, and I think cinema is on the cusp of such a transformation.\u201d</p> <p>He hopes that the film\u2019s combination of the multimedia elements and layered depictions of contemporary multicultural London push it into \u201cuncharted territory, especially in a British cinematic tradition\u201d. Stylistically speaking, as a point of contrast, the playful A Moving Image is the polar opposite of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/may/12/i-daniel-blake-ken-loachs-welfare-state-polemic-is-blunt-dignified-and-brutally-moving\" title=\"\">I, Daniel Blake</a>, the politically vigorous, formally conservative Palme d\u2019Or-winner from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/ken-loach\" title=\"\">Ken Loach</a>, who remains the standard-bearer for British social realist cinema.</p> <p>When I ask Amoo about his influences, he cites Philadelphia artist Don Christian, whose music appears in the film, and Nigerian performance artist Jelili Atiku. He mentions no film-makers, but there are hints of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/spikelee\" title=\"\">Spike Lee</a>\u2019s Brechtian brio, particularly his 1989 masterpiece <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/do-the-right-thing\" title=\"\">Do The Right Thing</a>, which contained a memorable riff on gentrification: a scene in which a brownstone-bound, middle-class white bicyclist sparks incredulity among the local black and Latino community by claiming he was born in the area.</p> <p>The film also features a host of direct addresses to camera, another distinctly Lee-esque touch, and a community focal point \u2013 known in the film as Big Ben \u2013 who acts as a troubadour-cum-Greek chorus. \u201cBig Ben to me is the spiritual essence of Brixton,\u201d says Amoo. \u201cWhat\u2019s interesting is that the song he sings, (Sometimes These South London Streets Remind Me Of) Brooklyn, was written by him before he knew about the film.\u201d</p> <p>So, will the likes of Big Ben be around the area for long? Do the film-makers think these current trends are reversible? \u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem like it,\u201d says Fear, \u201cbecause these developers don\u2019t see the value in community. They only value financial profit, so we are left with crude vestiges of what has gone before in these \u2018gourmet jerk chicken shops \u2026 but no black people\u2019, as one character in the film says.\u201d Given recent Brixton developments, such as the controversial approval of plans to redevelop the long-standing railway arches that house independent businesses, Fear could be right.</p> <p>Amoo, for his part, is a little more hopeful: \u201cI think change is inevitable but gentrification isn\u2019t \u2013 if we really value culture and diversity, surely some investment can be made to protect it.

  "<p>Matteo Renzi, the Italian prime minister once seen as a great reformist hope after years of economic stagnation, is at risk of becoming the next political casualty of an unwanted referendum result, with polls showing him facing tough opposition before a critical vote.</p> <p>Renzi headed into a packed auditorium in the north-eastern city of Treviso this week to make his case for a complicated change to the country\u2019s constitution, saying that the referendum scheduled for 4 December would set Italy\u2019s course over the next three decades.</p> <p>\u201cIf you want this country to change \u2013 not for me, not for you, but for the sake of our children \u2013 if you want it to have a simpler system, stand by me, because I can\u2019t make it alone,\u201d he told the audience. \u201cIf the referendum doesn\u2019t pass, over the next 30 years whoever is prime minister will \u2026 be a slave to vetoes, blackmail and bureaucracy,\u201d he said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/political-science/2016/oct/06/why-referendums-are-problematic-yet-more-popular-than-ever\">Why referendums are problematic \u2013 yet more popular than ever</a> </p> </aside>  <p>On the face of it, the referendum is centred on a complicated change to Italy\u2019s constitution that Renzi and his allies argue will make the country easier to govern and reform by disempowering the senate, the upper chamber of parliament. Critics of the constitutional change, which has already been approved by parliament but with too small a majority to avoid a referendum, have argued that it is potentially dangerous and leaves too much power in the hands of the executive.<br></p> <p>But, like Britain\u2019s EU referendum, the December vote is not only seen as a debate over the question at hand, in this case a question most suited to a law school seminar.

From the moment \u2013 when he was still fairly popular \u2013 that he vowed to put the issue to the people, he made the vote about himself. In a promise he now surely regrets, he said he would resign if the no vote prevailed and never return to politics.</p> <p>Renzi had not anticipated that voters might lose faith in him, angry that the economy is not improving fast enough and disillusioned by his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/18/maria-elena-boschi-the-italian-mp-fighting-for-reform-and-family\">poor handling of four bank rescues late last year</a> that sparked accusations he was handing out favours to the political elite at the expense of ordinary Italians.</p> <p>The breezy confidence that had once made Renzi look like a man who could recreate a powerful centrist majority to last for generations started to resemble arrogance.</p> <p>\u201cHe thought that his personality and personal position would be an element that would favour the yes vote, and then he realised that, in fact, he was not going to make the yes stronger, but he could be making the no stronger,\u201d said Giovanni Orsina, a professor of contemporary history at LUISS University in Rome.</p> <p>\u201cHe has been trying to depersonalise the referendum in the last months but it has become difficult for him because he tends to personalise everything, even though he knows he shouldn\u2019t,\u201d he added. Orsini said he believed the situation was still far too fluid to predict an outcome. And, as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\">voters in Britain</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/03/colombia-farc-peace-deal-voter-referendum-reaction\">Colombia</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/02/hungarian-vote-on-refugees-will-not-take-place-suggest-first-poll-results\">Hungary</a> have shown in recent months, trying to predict the behaviour of voters in referendums is never easy anyway. </p> <p>Experts think the polls are unreliable. A recent effort by Corriere della Sera found that 23% of the electorate supported a yes vote, 25% were opposed, and 52% were either undecided or would not respond. Another this week by EMG, a polling firm, found 31% in favour, 36% opposed, and 33% were undecided. </p> <p>Renzi\u2019s support is thought to be especially weak in the south and among young voters who are attracted to the populist Five Star Movement (M5S).</p> <p>Voters looking to guidance from their own party establishment have been left frustrated as Renzi\u2019s Partito Democratico (PD) is split \u2013 not unlike Britons who saw a lukewarm endorsement of remain by the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn. </p> <p>And the complicated nature of the reform itself makes campaigning difficult. \u201cIt takes Renzi five minutes to explain it, whereas if you are [M5S leader] Beppe Grillo all you say is, \u2018It\u2019s about Renzi,\u2019\u201d said Wolfango Piccoli, co-president of political risk advisory firm Teneo Intelligence.</p> <p>The proposed change would reduce the number of senators serving in the upper parliament from 315 to 100; those who serve would no longer be elected directly but would be regional representatives instead. Renzi argues the changes will increase political stability in Italy and give lawmakers a better chance to pass tough reforms that could improve the economy but are politically unpopular.</p> <p>One of the biggest concerns about the constitutional change, however, is how it would work in conjunction with a separate electoral reform law \u2013 one that is not included in the referendum \u2013 that would make it easier for a party that won an election to take the majority of seats of parliament\u2019s lower house. </p> <p>In studying the Brexit results, Renzi has probably learned that fear alone will not be enough for a yes victory. In the UK, a slim margin of voters ultimately rejected the view of experts who predicted economic doom if the country left the EU. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/22/they-need-a-possibility-of-a-future-has-matteo-renzi-given-italy-what-it-needs\">'They need a possibility of a future': has Matteo Renzi given Italy what it needs?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Renzi and his supporters can legitimately point to some potentially negative consequences if Italy votes no, beginning with the likely dissolution of the parliament and new elections that could open the door to a victory by the anti-establishment but inexperienced M5S.<br></p> <p>The problem for Renzi is that Italians are not necessarily spooked by political instability: they have witnessed it before \u2013 plenty of it \u2013 and survived. \u201cThe voters will say \u2018I know one thing, you [Renzi] are out and that is good enough for me,\u2019\u201d said Piccoli. \u201cTo scare Italians, the threshold is high.\u201d</p> <p>Renzi has taken that lesson on board. Over the past few weeks, he has focused on trying to boost his own damaged popularity with the kinds of political promises, such as the future construction of a multibillion-euro bridge from Sicily to the mainland, that used to be doled out by Berlusconi. Renzi had once decried the same project as a waste of money. </p> <p>Still, even though the current climate does not favour Renzi, his defeat is far from certain. He has almost two months to make his case to those voters who have yet to make up their minds. </p> <p>The prime minister \u2013 whose political acumen, despite recent setbacks, has been compared to that of Machiavelli \u2013 has suggested he relishes the challenge, telling <a href=\"http://www.vogue.com/13480367/italian-prime-minister-matteo-renzi-government-reform/\">Vogue in a recent profile</a> that he had been working out to prepare himself for the tough campaign ahead with a new exercise regime, including sessions with a judo master. \u201cIt\u2019s when I have everyone against me, that\u2019s when I have the most fun,\u201d he said. </p> <p><br></p>",
  "<p>Scottish ministers have banned the use of a technique to extract methane by burning underground coal beds, after expert advice said it posed too many risks to the climate and environment.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Paul Wheelhouse, the Scottish environment minister, said he was asking ministers in London to revoke six licences to find test sites for the technique, known as underground coal gasification (UGC), in central and south-west Scotland.</p> <p>He said <a href=\"http://www.gov.scot/Publications/2016/10/2704\">an expert report from Prof Campbell Gemmell</a>, former chief executive of the Scottish Environment Protection Agency, had found it was unproven, under-regulated and too risky to be approved.</p> <p>Wheelhouse said the infant industry had a history of pollution accidents and \u201closs of containment issues\u201d at test sites in other countries, but added that the ban could be lifted if it proved safe in future. </p> <p>To the delight of environment campaigners, Wheelhouse said: \u201cIt is the Scottish government\u2019s view that UGC poses numerous and serious environmental risks and, on that basis, the Scottish government cannot support this technology. Accordingly, UCG will have no place in Scotland\u2019s energy mix at this time.\u201d</p> <p>Environmentalists believe the Scottish ban will add pressure on UK ministers to ban or postpone possible UCG projects in England, despite giving the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/06/uk-fracking-given-go-ahead-as-lancashire-council-rejection-is-overturned\">go-ahead on Thursday to the UK\u2019s biggest fracking site yet, on the Fylde in Lancashire</a>.</p> <p>Scottish ministers are still wrestling with their policy on fracking, repeatedly delaying a final decision in the face of strong industry pressure to support it after divisions emerged within the cabinet over its potential value to Scotland\u2019s ailing economy and energy industries.</p> <p>Scotland <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jan/28/scotland-announces-moratorium-on-fracking-for-shale-gas\">has had a moratorium on commercial fracking and coalbed methane drilling since January 2015</a>, and Wheelhouse said on Thursday he would publish a set of scientific papers on fracking and open up a public consultation later this autumn. </p> <p>Scotland had been at the forefront of attempts in the UK by several energy companies and some academics to develop UCG because of its extensive network of rich coal seams under land and the Firth of Forth near Edinburgh and Solway Firth north of Carlisle.</p> <p>The technique involves chemically igniting coal seams, under controlled conditions, and then capturing the released methane-rich gases at ground level before processing the gases. Those could feed chemicals plants and power stations, they said, adding to the UK\u2019s domestic energy mix. </p> <p>Developers promised that excess carbon dioxide would be buried offshore in carbon capture and storage sites; some claimed the technology promised a bonanza for the unconventional gas industry, with sites eventually being exploited far offshore in the Atlantic or in the North Sea. The European commission has invested tens of millions of euros in UCG research projects.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Unlike fracking, UGC technology is still untested, very costly and years away from approval by UK regulators, making the Scottish government\u2019s decision to ban it relatively easy. One of the two developers, Five Quarter, recently went into receivership.</p> <p>There are no carbon capture and storage sites yet in operation in the UK, and no evidence that carbon capture would be cost effective, undermining the business case for UGC. </p> <p>Environmental campaigners were jubilant following Wheelhouse\u2019s announcement. Friends of the Earth Scotland (FoES) pointed to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/apr/18/queensland-bans-underground-coal-gasification-over-environmental-risk\">a case in Queensland, Australia</a>, where developers of one test site, Linc Energy, are now being prosecuted after contamination and leaks into the environment.</p> <p>Mary Church, head of campaigns with FoES, said: \u201cThis is a victory for people power. Setting coal seams alight under two of our major firths was always a reckless idea. <br></p> <p>\u201cThe history of UCG is littered with contamination incidents, ground subsidence and industrial accidents. [We] look forward to the Scottish government acting swiftly to ban shale gas fracking and coalbed methane drilling once it has finished its review.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jul/25/burning-coal-gas-uk-seabeds-flame-pollution-report-coal-authority-ucg\">Burning coal for gas in UK seabeds would flame pollution, says report</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Andrew Nunn, the chief operating officer for the most active UCG developer, Cluff Natural Resources, which has three development licences in Scotland, said the country would now miss out.

He used a pseudonym,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.crdsc-sdrcc.ca/eng/home\" title=\"\">read the report</a>.</p> <p>\u201cHe specified in his post that he wanted to meet a woman who was drug-free and disease-free. He also indicated that he wanted a \u2018professional\u2019 person. Mr. Barber testified that the purpose of his post was to \u2018find a partner for the week or weekend\u2019 as \u2018a way to relieve stress\u2019. He acknowledged under cross-examination that his purpose was to have a \u2018sexual encounter of some sort\u2019 if all went well.

He added that he relied upon his judgment in meeting her and chatting in determining that she was drug-free. It turned out that he was wrong. It was the first time that he\u2019d done such a thing.\u201d</p> <p>The next day, Barber was selected for a doping control after competing at the Canadian championships.

A \u201cbathroom ban\u201d preventing transgender students from using toilets not matching the gender on their birth certificates has reopened the wounds of America\u2019s culture wars, leading to a boycott by college sport authorities and protests from leading employers such as Apple, American Airlines and Bank of America.</p> \n<p>But the conservative wave that allowed Republicans to take control of all layers of local government in the state is now threatening to drown the party itself. The fervour stoked by battles over gay rights, voter registration laws, and immigration is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/29/donald-trump-nascar-north-carolina-republicans\">putting off many moderates</a> and could yet see Democrats win presidential, Senate and gubernatorial races here in November. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6011b052faaaed6f7ab94217eec26f852b51a891\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6011b052faaaed6f7ab94217eec26f852b51a891/0_245_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Demonstrators march to protest about the police shooting of Keith Scott in Charlotte.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Demonstrators march to protest about the police shooting of Keith Scott in Charlotte.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mike Blake/Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>What has made such controversies so shocking to many outsiders is that the Tar Heel state had long since stopped conforming to any easy stereotypes of a politically conservative southern backwater.

  "<p>On the evening of 20 August 1997, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLp-9mS_demfcVD5OgcDS6xpQbLZ-d04hv\" title=\"\">BBC1 broadcast Right Here Right Now</a>, a panegyric to Oasis on the eve of their third album, Be Here Now.

Be Here Now was reframed first as a disappointment and then as a disaster. It burned out quickly, falling well short of the sales achieved by 1995\u2019s (What\u2019s the Story) Morning Glory, with many copies ended up in secondhand racks. Noel himself quickly disowned it, dismissing it in the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iu0F0LZbbd4\" title=\"\">2003 Britpop documentary Live Forever</a> as \u201cthe sound of five men in the studio, on coke, not giving a fuck\u201d.

And I still think it\u2019s great.\u201d)</p> <p>As Be Here Now returns in the form of a deluxe box set, and the band\u2019s story is retold in the documentary Oasis: Supersonic, the album still inspires extreme reactions. If it couldn\u2019t be Britpop\u2019s zenith, then it must be the nadir. It can\u2019t be just a collection of songs \u2013 some good, some bad, most too long, all insanely overproduced \u2013 but an emblem of the hubris before the fall, like a dictator\u2019s statue pulled to the ground by a vengeful mob. The glowing reviews have become an opportunity for schadenfreude: evidence that music critics had, at best, lost all perspective and, at worst, deliberately misled their readers. \u201cRight here and right now, this is the place to be,\u201d trumpeted the Daily Telegraph. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2007/aug/21/cocainesupernovaoasisbeher\" title=\"\">Mojo\u2019s reviewer was even moved to patois</a>: \u201cThis is Oasis\u2019s World Domination Album.

The starting point in revisiting the album is the acceptance that in 1997, Oasis were woven into Britain\u2019s cultural fabric like no other band since the Beatles. Definitely Maybe permanently moved the goalposts for alternative rock in general and Creation Records in particular. (What\u2019s the Story) Morning Glory was simply unavoidable. Wilkinson remembers hearing a pub full of pensioners sing along to Wonderwall when it came on the jukebox. \u201cIt seemed like an everyperson record,\u201d he says. \u201cThere was a universality.\u201d As Lester wrote in his review: \u201cMuch of the pleasure with Oasis is bound up in the shared historical moment \u2026 Like those other mid-90s newcomers, Friends, the internet, Spice Girls and the lottery, Oasis have managed to infiltrate British life in record time.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/oct/02/supersonic-review-oasis-documentary-noel-gallagher-liam-gallagher-mat-whitecross\">Supersonic review \u2013 Oasis pop history lesson ignores battles</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThere are good populisms and bad populisms,\u201d Niven says. \u201cIn the mid-90s, there was a sense that you might just have a good populism, and Oasis seemed to embody that. It nodded at sport and working-class culture and the heritage of the counterculture. Obviously, it wasn\u2019t substantial enough so it didn\u2019t realise its potential, but there is something valuable in that idea. I\u2019m not sure we\u2019ve had a collective moment on that level since. You can only get those moments when there\u2019s a hovering suggestion of a genuine democratic breakthrough, as there was in the 60s and the mid-90s.\u201d</p> <p>Oasis\u2019s everyman sensibility couldn\u2019t survive the sudden flood of money and fame, unprecedented for a band from the independent scene. Noel\u2019s new milieu of mega-gigs, celebrity parties, tabloid ubiquity and champagne at No 10 did his muse no favours. Oasis\u2019s earlier songs had an exhilarating underdog hunger, but Be Here Now was mostly written and demoed at Mick Jagger\u2019s villa in Mustique with a vast new audience in mind. \u201cYou start off writing songs that you\u2019re not sure who\u2019s going to hear them,\u201d Noel told author Daniel Rachel. \u201cThen, when I tried to write the next batch of songs, you\u2019re like: \u2018We\u2019ve got 20 million fans in the world.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>The box set reveals an intriguing vulnerability in the demos. Stand By Me has the weary tenderness of Half the World Away, and Noel\u2019s jaundiced acoustic version of the Beatles\u2019 Help! sounds like a cri de coeur: \u201cAnd now my life has changed in oh so many ways.\u201d That quality was flattened in the studio by the cocaine panzers, as songs were elongated and smothered in up to 30 layers of guitars. Repentant producer Owen Morris later summed it up thus: \u201cMassive amounts of drugs. Big fights. Bad vibes. Shit recordings.\u201d He called the final mix \u2013 a bludgeoning, airless wall of noise \u2013 \u201can utter disgrace\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ff41588151c0b924a6136d71948009381f22d390\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ff41588151c0b924a6136d71948009381f22d390/0_174_3072_1843/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The cover of the album Be Here Now featured a Rolls-Royce in a swimming pool\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The cover of the album Be Here Now featured a Rolls-Royce in a swimming pool.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Daily Mail/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Before this self-conscious gigantism bedazzled critics, it bedazzled Noel and Morris. All Around the World was a white elephant based on a catastrophic misunderstanding of Hey Jude and the comeback single D\u2019You Know What I Mean? was more rally than song. \u201cIt was massively, nuttily assertive: listen to me!\u201d says Wilkinson. \u201cBut what was it saying? Nothing. It\u2019s a blank space. A void.\u201d Tim Abbot, then the marketing director at Creation, used an analogy from visual art: \u201cThey came down as little matchstick men and became a Koons.\u201d</p> <p>Noel\u2019s pre-release interviews struck an oddly ambivalent note (\u201cThis record ain\u2019t going to surprise many people,\u201d he told NME), but there was nobody to echo his reservations. \u201cEveryone\u2019s going: \u2018It\u2019s brilliant!\u2019\u201d he later said. \u201cAnd right towards the end, we\u2019re doing the mixing and I\u2019m thinking to myself: \u2018Hmmm, I don\u2019t know about this now.\u2019\u201d According to Oasis\u2019s former press officer, Johnny Hopkins: \u201cThere were more hangers-on, constantly telling them they were the greatest thing. That tended to block out the critical voices.\u201d For anyone invested in Oasis\u2019s continued success, Be Here Now was too big to fail.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MywWolXGIx8\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/MywWolXGIx8?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption> </figcaption> </figure>   <p>Alan McGee, Creation\u2019s pathologically ebullient founder, told the press it was \u201cabsolute genius\u201d and would sell 20m. But Oasis\u2019s management firm, Ignition, was keen to manage the hype while thwarting the new threat of internet leaks, leading to neurotic secrecy. Hopkins first heard Be Here Now, alongside other key personnel, at Noel\u2019s north London home, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1999/nov/28/burhanwazir.theobserver\" title=\"\">Supernova Heights</a>. \u201cWe were sat around his dining table,\u201d he remembers. \u201cIt felt a bit like a board meeting. There was a massive weight of expectation so it was really hard to hear it as a record in its own right.\u201d</p> <p>Ignition waged war with radio DJs and fan websites and required anyone handling advance copies to sign a non-disclosure agreement that barred them from even discussing it with anyone else. NDAs are commonplace now, and often more extreme, but to receive one from Creation in 1997 felt absurd. \u201cThe secrecy was hilarious,\u201d Parkes says. \u201cIt was ludicrously self-important and it was only going to breed resentment.\u201d Marcus Russell of Ignition later admitted: \u201cI don\u2019t think that was the right way to go about it.\u201d</p> <p>Any resentment, however, was outweighed by the desire of publications to keep their most bankable cover stars on side. Parkes remembers his originally ambivalent review being shorn of its most negative lines by his editor. \u201cThe pressure on critics was unprecedented. Prior to that, the music press could be honest because the industry had nowhere else to go, but now it had lots of other places to go. The music press was required to hold its nerve and it didn\u2019t. It was embarrassing. It is not the job of the reviewer to pick out the records that are going to sell the most copies and praise them.\u201d (\u201cWe wouldn\u2019t have denied magazines interviews just because of bad reviews,\u201d Hopkins says.)</p> <p>Another factor was the music press\u2019s embarrassment over its lukewarm reviews of What\u2019s the Story. Lines such as \u201cDon\u2019t Look Back in Anger disappoints\u201d (Melody Maker) and \u201cWonderwall achieves no real lift-off\u201d (Q) looked out of step when the whole country was singing those songs. \u201cThe unspoken thing was that Melody Maker had given the last album a tepid review and it was going to make damn sure that didn\u2019t happen again,\u201d Parkes says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9a637435250a1860c190740a701531220dca628a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9a637435250a1860c190740a701531220dca628a/0_0_5121_3342/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Noel Gallagher, 1996\" width=\"1000\" height=\"653\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Noel Gallagher, 1996.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Patrick Ford/Redferns</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Du Noyer, however, doesn\u2019t recall any editorial pressure. He was genuinely rooting for Oasis to extend their hot streak. \u201cI really hoped it was going to be a great record because I liked what Oasis represented,\u201d he says. \u201cI thought they were a thoroughly positive presence in national life.\u201d Only when he saw the finished artwork\u2019s preposterous tableau of timepieces and rock star bric-a-brac did he think twice. \u201cI thought, bloody hell, this is a confused piece of work that\u2019s trying to say so many things that it says absolutely nothing. Had I seen it, I might not have given them the benefit of the doubt.\u201d</p> <p>Wilkinson was also carried away by his fandom. \u201cI was definitely on their side. There weren\u2019t many bands who were demonstrably from a council estate background. The way they became part of the establishment was pleasantly absurd. I remember thinking in my heart of hearts there was something not quite right about what I was saying, but such was the phenomenal momentum you did want it to keep going \u2013 for them and the wider world. That made me err on the side of generosity.\u201d He laughs. \u201cI was completely wrong, of course, but at least it was hysterically bad to the extent where it\u2019s remarkable.\u201d</p> <p>Be Here Now\u2019s inevitable success warped the usual critical parameters. Reviewers weren\u2019t so much analysing music as bearing witness to a phenomenon and seeking to prolong a collective high. They noted the record\u2019s flaws \u2013 nonsensical lyrics, a stolid resistance to new ideas \u2013 only to sweep them under the rug of its presumed popularity, talking of \u201cyet another 11 songs the slightly sozzled world will be bursting to sing\u201d (NME) and \u201carenas full of waving scarves and flaming cigarette lighters across the planet\u201d (the Observer). Translation: several million Oasis fans can\u2019t be wrong.</p> <p>\u201cI was caught up in the excitement of it all,\u201d Lester says. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry to everybody for that review, but the enormity of it was captivating. We were reviewing a moment in history and staking our part in it. It was like seeing the great behemoth of a spaceship in Close Encounters. You felt awed into submission.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou want the record to be good because you\u2019re into the band,\u201d says Hopkins. \u201cAnd you want it to be good because that means it\u2019s going to sell well and that\u2019s going to help the magazines sell well. But I was surprised that there wasn\u2019t a dissenting voice. When a band gets to that level, there\u2019s always someone who says, \u2018Hold on a minute,\u2019 but there wasn\u2019t [for Oasis].\u201d</p> <p>Be Here Now\u2019s reputation lasted only slightly longer than the effects of a line of cocaine, but its sudden collapse can\u2019t be pinned on the music alone. Oasis\u2019s imperial phase coincided with several national developments \u2013 including New Labour\u2019s unstoppable ascent, Euro 96 and Britpop in general \u2013 that fostered bullish optimism. Be Here Now arrived just as the tide was turning. The afterglow of Labour\u2019s election victory was fading and, 10 days after the album came out, Princess Diana died. The connection may seem suspiciously neat, but Niven remembers the national mood changing. \u201cBe Here Now was a bit late,\u201d he says. \u201cIt felt like a slightly different era. That mid-90s moment had definitely passed.\u201d More melancholic rock albums, such as Radiohead\u2019s OK Computer and the Verve\u2019s Urban Hymns felt far more relevant than Be Here Now\u2019s triumphalist roar.</p> <p>\u201cThe Oasis phenomenon had grown to astonishing proportions and it didn\u2019t occur to me that it could go into reverse so abruptly,\u201d says Du Noyer. \u201cThe backlash isn\u2019t something I foresaw or understood. I don\u2019t think anyone\u2019s ever wrong to like or dislike a piece of music, but I think I was wrong in misreading the way the public mood was going to turn. Britpop was running out of steam and Be Here Now was the canary down the coalmine that told us this great movement in which we\u2019d all invested such hopes wasn\u2019t really going anywhere.\u201d</p> <p>Be Here Now\u2019s mind-addling properties were specific to 90s Britain at its bombastic peak but similar groupthink occurs today whenever a major artist receives a gush of overnight reviews from critics who seem to be marking an event rather than unpacking the music, which they will have heard under more restrictive circumstances than those Oasis reviewers \u2013 hear it once, then get the review out while people are talking about the record. Might one of those albums one day inspire an equivalently drastic U-turn?</p> <p>\u201cYou can easily imagine that happening with a Kanye or Frank Ocean album,\u201d Lester says. \u201cYou\u2019re reviewing the excitement around the record. Nobody wants to get it wrong. When there are 7,000 people proclaiming the Frank Ocean album a work of genius, who wants to be the voice in the wilderness saying otherwise? It was like that with Be Here Now. It almost felt inevitable: \u2018This is a magnificent work of unparalleled rock majesty.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>If the unforgiving reviews of the box set are any indication, the pendulum of received wisdom may never swing back in Be Here Now\u2019s favour. It\u2019s become an Aunt Sally for the sins of its era: a symbol rather than a piece of music. \u201cNowadays its reputation as one of the worst albums ever is as unfair as the hype at the time,\u201d says Parkes. \u201cIt\u2019s not even the worst album Oasis made. People might start listening to it again as a curio. There\u2019s something really strange about it. It\u2019s a fascinating historical document.\u201d</p> <p><em>\u2022 Be Here Now: Super Deluxe Box Set is out on 14 October on Big Brother Recordings; Mat Whitecross\u2019s documentary on Oasis, Supersonic is in cinemas on Friday</em></p>",

It\u2019s a&#xa0;48-minute long hip-hop-influenced performance poem about the alienated lives of the residents of one south London street, set to a variety of post-dubstep bass music. It opens with an invocation of Mother Earth and ends with a plea for humanity to, as Primal Scream once had it, come together&#xa0;as one. In between, it variously takes aim at capitalism, gentrification, celebrity culture, political corruption and global warming (\u201cthe water is rising, the elephants and polar bears are dying\u201d). There is a joke about David Cameron having it off with a pig\u2019s head. It\u2019s somehow redolent of the kind of well-meaning event you see&#xa0;advertised at a local arts centre and make a mental note to avoid at all costs \u2013 partly because it seems so painfully earnest, and partly because at least half&#xa0;the audience seems likely to consist of recalcitrant 14-year-olds dragged there by an English teacher who insists pupils call him by his first name and says things like \u201cSiegfried Sassoon was&#xa0;the Lil\u2019 Wayne of his day\u201d.</p> <p>But there\u2019s a reason Kate Tempest has become the first poet to make authentic headway in the world of pop since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/john-cooper-clarke\" title=\"\">John Cooper Clarke</a> and Linton Kwesi Johnson the best part of 40 years ago; to cross the boundary from performances at the Edinburgh Fringe and, indeed, local arts centres to making albums that are eagerly awaited by people who don\u2019t normally take much notice of performance poetry. There are plenty of talented people doing their thing at poetry slam events up and down the country, but only Tempest has been gifted an hour of prime-time terrestrial TV on which to launch Let Them Eat Chaos.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-aRxIWgFLpA\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/-aRxIWgFLpA?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Performed live as part of last week\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/oct/02/bbc2-poetry-night-kate-tempest\" title=\"\">BBC2 poetry night</a>, and broadcast immediately after a programme in which Rick Stein talked about cuddly old John Betjeman and a variety of writers waxed whimsical about a train journey from Euston to Glasgow to a light orchestral backing, Let Them Eat Chaos understandably felt like a bomb going off in a chintzy tea shop. But even stripped of that context, it still sounds remarkably potent. You could argue that it offers a&#xa0;pretty well-thumbed checklist of liberal woes, but as Tempest\u2019s voice gradually rises in anger over the clanking rhythm track midway through Europe Is Lost, it\u2019s hard not to get carried along with it. That\u2019s partly because, however unsurprising her targets, her writing is often brilliantly acute, not least on the solipsism of latterday pop culture: \u201cSaccharine ballads and selfies and selfies and selfies and here\u2019s me outside the palace of me.\u201d</p> <p>In fact, the rant that consumes the second half of Europe Is Lost is presented as the confused worries of a&#xa0;knackered professional carer, back home after a double shift \u2013 one of seven characters the poem depicts. They\u2019re uniformly well drawn and believable, from a girl holding an internal dialogue with a murdered friend (\u201cWhat\u2019s it like where you\u2019ve gone? It\u2019s OK, I know you can\u2019t say\u201d) to a successful young businessman struggling to establish whether adulthood is now upon him, and what that might mean for his life.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOXXdYtZSbQ\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/TOXXdYtZSbQ?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2015/aug/19/kate-tempest-slams-conventional-poets-disdain-for-performance\">Kate Tempest slams conventional poets' disdain for performance</a> </p> </aside>  <p>At its most lighthearted, it vaguely recalls <a href=\"http://\" title=\"\">the Streets\u2019 debut album</a>. Whoops feels not unlike one of Mike Skinner\u2019s tales of dancefloor excess recast for a more troubled era, with its protagonist\u2019s intemperance fuelled by something dark in his past, and driven by the fact that he\u2019s still stuck living with his parents: he might be making the wrong choices, but even if he were making the right ones, the property market means he\u2019d still be there. Elsewhere, the pen portraits are powered by an eye for detail \u2013 Blu-Tack stains \u201cgrease the walls\u201d of a flat about to be vacated; an apparently reformed hedonist recalls scrounging drugs from friends with \u201cpuppy-dog eyes for the acid on their fingertips\u201d \u2013 and by the fact that Tempest knows when to leave the listener hanging: the dead friend may&#xa0;or may not be the father of the protagonist\u2019s son; the hedonist may have reformed, but it isn\u2019t entirely clear where that has left her life.</p> <p>The words and their delivery are obviously the point of Let Them Eat Chaos, but they aren\u2019t the only thing that makes it compelling. From the slowly pulsating electronic currents of Breaks to Perfect Coffee\u2019s early Chicago house chug, the music is uniformly great. It\u2019s never so showy that it distracts from Tempest\u2019s voice \u2013 it&#xa0;doesn\u2019t really do choruses \u2013 but equally, it\u2019s never mere background music. It adds to the impressive sense&#xa0;of assurance that oozes off the&#xa0;album. In terms of visibility, Kate Tempest is&#xa0;currently way ahead of her performance-poet peers. Out on her own, she sounds like a woman who knows exactly what she\u2019s doing.</p>",
  "<p><em>In this new series, anonymous writers share the most painful moment of their marriage: the moment they knew their relationship was over</em></p> <p>We were paired by her best friend. I was exceedingly naive, and though no virgin, was blindsided by my first taste of serial sex. We lived together for a year while I completed a bachelor\u2019s degree in 20th century drama and she worked as a legal secretary. She had tried university herself for a semester at the urging of girlfriends but quickly discovered that further time in a classroom held no interest. </p> <p>She was the pampered daughter of divorced parents. She had a fancy new car and liked to party. I, on the other hand, was tenuously holding the military draft at bay by maintaining a student deferment in grad school during the day. Nights I tended bar for food and rent money.</p> <p>To simplify practical matters of daily life, we decided to marry. It had to be in a Catholic church, even though she was not Catholic and I could barely comprehend religion. She wanted \u201cceremony\u201d, so we had that, with classical musician friends accompanying the mass, and a loud organ soundtrack. We invited no actual family to attend.</p> <p>There was a brief and anticlimactic post-nuptial party in the kitchen of the apartment we shared with another couple, and emphasizing the importance of the event, the next morning the bride flew off northwards for a one-day visit with her mother.</p> <p>I went to a Jimi Hendrix concert with my buddy Red. </p> <p>She arrived back the afternoon of the very next day, 48 hours after we were married, to the telephone ringing. Her mother had died of an overdose, on pills that her daughter had just presented as a gift. </p> <p>Our marriage was over the moment she hung up the phone.</p> <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> <p>I had not paid attention to what was happening around me. I knew my partner had been prescribed daily amphetamine capsules by her doctor to \u201chelp her lose weight\u201d. But I did not realize that she was also dosing herself with the barbiturate Seconal to help her sleep every night. Her doctor was also willing to give her multiple simultaneous prescriptions, and beneath my radar she had become something of a distributor. </p> <p>I can only excuse myself by whining that I was in grad school, worrying about a looming term of imprisonment in the army, and wearing blinders as only an overly self-centered and self-confident fool can. </p> <p>I had no idea I was living with a completely out-of-control drug dealer.</p> <p>I stayed at her side to support her through the funeral, but when we got back to the apartment, I gathered a single small bag of clothing, stuck out my thumb, and bummed a ride westward. I moved into a different university community and quickly re-enrolled in graduate school but had drawn an incredibly low draft number. My academic career was terminated by the government.</p> <p>I was finally and forcibly conscripted as a draftee into the US army, sent overseas, served my time as a clerk, and was not killed. </p> <p>When I returned stateside, I almost wished I had been. Credit cards in my name had been issued and maxed out by my still-legal spouse, and subsequently creditors had been hounding my parents for money. The spouse had disappeared upon my arrival. </p> <p>It took two years to pay off my ex\u2019s debts. </p> <p>Three years later I was brought from a deep sleep at daybreak on my birthday by insistent banging on my door. The gentleman saw the look on my face and smiled. He was a paid courier and held out a paper packet, legally serving me with what unfolded to be a divorce decree. And then he handed me an accompanying fifth of bourbon. Birthday present from the divorcee. The termination was official. </p> <p>As I had a sunrise pull from my liquid gift, I speculated that the woman had really found a change in heart, that maybe she was not as terminally corrupt as I had thought. </p> <p>A day later, I found out that her father had died and left her a vast amount of money, land and valuable investments. The first thing she had used the cash for was to hire a lawyer and legally get rid of me, so I would have no claim on her new wealth.</p> <p>I didn\u2019t care about the marriage, or its end. But the bourbon came in handy.</p>",

I looked around at the other men in the room, particularly our American cast member Francois Battiste, and I decided to shut the discussion down.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ee364d50dae5d32652791de49acacb70406c010a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ee364d50dae5d32652791de49acacb70406c010a/0_448_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sope Dirisu as Cassius Clay, right, and David Ajala as football star Jim Brown in One Night in Miami.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sope Dirisu as Cassius Clay, right, and David Ajala as football star Jim Brown in One Night in Miami.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Johan Persson</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For anyone who has worked with me, the idea that I would exclude anything from the rehearsal room may come as a surprise. My process revolves around the exploration and articulation of everything the world throws at us and delving into our own deep emotional hinterland; the two then collide through the text of the play. This process does not allow for the exclusion of seismic events that personally touch each individual in the room.<br></p> <p>I asked the actors if we could do something radical that day. We removed 90% of the furniture from the set and, rather than work scene by scene as we had planned to, I suggested we run the play non-stop from beginning to end. No discussion, no preparation, just take to the air and see where we land. This would be almost a week earlier than we had planned, but the actors all agreed to just hit it.</p> <p>I\u2019m sure there\u2019s a clear psychological explanation for my reaction. Avoidance is a tool I use successfully each time I\u2019m about to start writing a new narrative. (Never is my house cleaner, or my garden in better shape.) But this was neither an act of avoidance nor of channelling rage or pain into the work. It was an attempt to not allow the bandwidth of my company be decreased by acts of terror that have the potential to traumatise beyond their geographic location.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dffd955e25770cbf95aa976bd1852a14d8327531\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dffd955e25770cbf95aa976bd1852a14d8327531/0_448_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Director Kwame Kwei-Armah, right, in rehearsal.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Something radical \u2026 director Kwame Kwei-Armah, right, in rehearsal with cast member Arinz\u00e9 Kene (playing Sam Cooke).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Johan Persson</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I had witnessed this trauma in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/feb/02/kwame-kwei-armah-center-stage\">my adopted city of Baltimore</a> after the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/14/zimmerman-acquitted-killing-trayvon-martin\">acquittal of George Zimmerman</a> for the murder of Trayvon Martin. I saw in the eyes of black mothers and fathers alike, an almost existential angst as they tried to realign this new reality, against age-old strategies they had used to protect their children, their boys, from the ravages of extreme racism. I remember arriving at my theatre the next morning and seeing that pain in the eyes of some of my African American staff members. All of us were asking ourselves: how can I, how can art, help at this moment? We decided to commission eight local artists to write and perform whatever they wanted to on the subject, so long as they looked the trauma in question right in the eye. They performed these pieces on the streets, in community centres, in the homes of those most touched by the events and then led a post-show discussion around the issues. We were less interested in discussing police brutality, far more interested in discussing new tools for a new age. Our theory being that trauma binds you to the present and the past. There is no room for tomorrow in there. And without tomorrow, what do we have? Survival.

It was impossible to avoid the parallels of then and now. The play is set in 1964, during the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jul/01/civil-rights-america-1960s-activists-voting-rights-vietnam\">first civil rights era</a>. Each of the characters had lived through the kind of systemic inequalities that make or break you. Far from being broken, these men had soared! They were truly celebrated individuals. So celebrated that, in segregated Miami, Sam Cooke (albeit under cover) was allowed to stay at a whites-only hotel on the night <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2014/feb/23/muhammad-ali-sonny-liston\">Clay beat Sonny Liston</a> to become the heavyweight champion of the world. However, at the heart of our play, these men are in Malcolm X\u2019s segregated hotel room, negotiating how to serve. How to contribute. How to not be set apart from the community but help to elevate it. </p> <p>My cast of actors began to think of the modern black artists, entertainers and sportspeople and the questions they must be asking themselves amid what many are calling a second civil rights era. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/may/01/beyonce-lemonade-visual-album-review-woman-scorned\">Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s Lemonade</a>.

All of these acts of defiance and service rush to the surface. And although I applaud these acts from my soul, I find myself dissatisfied.</p> <p>Dissatisfied because the thing I find most fascinating about the icons in the play is not their acts of defiance but that they were intellectually on the cutting edge of new thoughts and ideas. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2005/nov/20/popandrock.urban1\">Sam Cooke</a> was way ahead of nearly every artist in owning his own record label and the publishing rights to his songs.

  "<p>Britain\u2019s retreat from empire is remembered in a popular iconography that contains only a little violence. Gandhi goes on&#xa0;hunger strikes and performs acts of passive resistance; the Suez debacle calls time on our pretensions as a world power; Macmillan heralds <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2007/apr/24/greatspeeches\" title=\"\">the wind of change in Africa</a>. All is done and dusted in the space of 15 years. For a postwar generation like mine, too young for national service and a troopship to the colonies, most of it happened inside the local Regal or&#xa0;Odeon. Movietone footage would show Princess X or Prince Y standing on a podium to witness a ceremony of national independence, smiling at the native dancers as fireworks explode overhead. This book supplies a more troubling image: as the sun sets on the greatest empire the world has ever seen, long columns of smoke fill the tropical skies. In a thousand bonfires, Britain is burning the historical evidence.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2016/aug/18/uncovering-truth-british-empire-caroline-elkins-mau-mau\">Uncovering the brutal truth about the British empire | Marc Parry</a> </p> </aside>  <p>At first, the process was rather carefree. When Britain quit India in 1947, a&#xa0;colonial official noted that \u201cthe press greatly enjoyed themselves with the pall of smoke which hung over Delhi with the mass destruction of documents\u201d. By the time of Malayan independence in 1957, the authorities were learning discretion. British soldiers drove cratefuls of papers in a civilian truck from the colony\u2019s capital, Kuala Lumpur, to what an administrator referred to as \u201cthe Navy\u2019s splendid incinerator\u201d in Singapore. This 220\u2011mile journey to a secret burning exemplified the \u201cconsiderable pains\u201d taken by the colony \u201cto avoid exacerbating relationships between the British government and those Malayans who might not have been so understanding\u201d. Four years later, in 1961, the colonial secretary Iain Macleod laid down some groundrules for British territories preparing for independence. No documents should be handed over to the successor regime that might embarrass Her Majesty\u2019s Government or its police, military and public servants; or that might compromise its sources of intelligence or be used \u201cunethically\u201d by the country\u2019s new government.</p> <p>Bonfires alone were too blunt a method of concealment. A newly liberated country might wonder why it inherited so few archives, while Britain might need to retain, for sentimental or other reasons, documents that in the wrong hands could damage its interests. The Colonial Office devised a&#xa0;system known as \u201cOperation Legacy\u201d that worked on the principle of parallel registries. Reliable civil servants, which in the government\u2019s eyes meant only those who were \u201cBritish subjects of European descent\u201d, were given charge of identifying and collecting all \u201csensitive\u201d documents and passing them up the bureaucratic chain. This meant that when the moment of independence came, if not before, they could either be destroyed on site or removed (\u201cmigrated\u201d became the official term) to the UK. As to the so-called \u201cLegacy\u201d files that the colony\u2019s new government would inherit, it was important that they gave an impression of completeness, either by creating false documents to replace those that had been weeded out or by making sure there was no reference to them in&#xa0;the files that remained.</p> <p>This purging of the record happened across the world, in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/guyana\" title=\"\">British Guiana</a>, Aden, Malta, North Borneo, Belize, the West Indies, Kenya, Uganda \u2013 wherever Britain ruled. In the words of Ian Cobain, it was a subversion of the Public Record Acts on an industrial scale, involving hundreds if not thousands of colonial officials, as well as MI5 and Special Branch officers and men and women from army, navy and air force. All of them, whether they knew it or not, were breaking a legal obligation to preserve important official papers for the historical record, in the expectation that most would eventually be declassified. The British government took extraordinary measures to make sure that the fate of these papers remained a secret, whether they had been \u201cmigrated\u201d to the UK or destroyed abroad.</p> <p>According to official instruction, the&#xa0;waste left by bonfires \u201cshould be reduced to ash and the ashes broken up\u201d. If burning was thought to be too difficult or unsuitable, then the sea offered an alternative. Officials in Kenya were told that documents could be \u201cpacked in weighted crates and dumped in very deep and current-free waters at maximum practicable distance from the coast\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f5ec78ad006214d8690b41a698b06e60494d5b19\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f5ec78ad006214d8690b41a698b06e60494d5b19/0_41_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Governor general Lord Mountbatten salutes India\u2019s National flag alongside his wife, Edwina, and prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru during India\u2019s first Independence Day celebrations in New Delhi, 1947.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Governor general Lord Mountbatten salutes India\u2019s National flag alongside his wife, Edwina, and prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru during India\u2019s first Independence Day celebrations in New Delhi, 1947.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Most of the files that survived \u2013 the&#xa0;concealed \u201cmigrated archive\u201d \u2013&#xa0;found their way to Hanslope Park, a&#xa0;country estate just off the M1 near Milton Keynes, where the&#xa0;Foreign Office maintained an enormous cache of documents under the title \u201cSpecial Collections\u201d. By Cobain\u2019s reckoning, 15&#xa0;miles of floor-to-ceiling shelving was packed with files that dated from the 17th century to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/cold-war\" title=\"\">cold war</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/aug/06/our-family-divided-by-the-troubles\" title=\"\">the Troubles in Northern Ireland</a> \u2013 files&#xa0;so numerous that their catalogue entries measured the metres of shelf space they occupied. Officially, none of&#xa0;these documents existed.</p> <p>Some discreet research by the Foreign Office in 1979 showed that only&#xa0;two (Kenya and Malta) of 37 former colonies were aware that their annals had been secreted in Britain or destroyed. The truth, so far as we now know it, emerged only because personal injury lawyers and the American historian Caroline Elkins pursued the evidence of a far crueller British response to Kenya\u2019s Mau Mau insurgency than the available public records suggested. In 2011, the FO finally conceded that it had somehow \u201coverlooked\u201d its secret documentary hoard at Hanslope Park, where the Kenyan files alone took up 60 metres of shelving. Two years later more than 5,000 Kenyan claimants received \u00a319.9m in&#xa0;compensation and expressions of regret from the then foreign secretary <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/williamhague\" title=\"\">William Hague</a>. \u201cWe believe there should be a debate about the past,\u201d said an FO official. \u201cIt is an enduring feature of our democracy that we are willing to learn from our history.\u201d But that particular lesson had never been intended.</p> <p>Why were British governments so determined to obscure and bowdlerise their country\u2019s colonial record? Some reasons are understandable: to spare individuals from embarrassment or prosecution; to help secure the loyalty of successor regimes during the commercial, military and political competition of the cold war. But Cobain goes further: Operation Legacy was intended to ensure that \u201cthe British way of doing things\u201d would be remembered with \u201cfondness and respect\u201d \u2013 that the conduct of its imperial retreat would be seen as exemplary. To go to such lengths of deception for something as intangible and imponderable as a place in history\u2019s good books may seem unlikely, but it was surely for these reasons, rather than any security concern, that, for example, British officialdom asked its servants to destroy or return to Britain any papers that \u201cmight be interpreted as showing religious intolerance on the part of HMG\u201d as well as \u201call papers which might be interpreted as showing racial discrimination against Africans (or Negros [sic] in the USA)\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Operation Legacy was intended to ensure that the conduct of Britain's imperial retreat would be seen as exemplary</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>There is something else. We like secrets. Cobain recounts the history of&#xa0;British state secrecy from 1250, when the members of England\u2019s Privy Council first swore to keep their proceedings private. The oath has remained unchanged for the nearly 800 years since, while secrecy as a habit has grown via legislation (particularly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/official-secrets-act\" title=\"\">the Official Secrets Act of&#xa0;1911</a>) and the confidentiality clauses contained in the humblest contract of&#xa0;employment. Cobain refers to it as \u201ca&#xa0;very British disease\u201d, and while he makes no comparison with other modern democracies \u2013 it would have been helpful to know, for example, how seriously the French state takes the duty of transparency \u2013 his conclusion that government secrecy in Britain is not \u201cjust an occasional necessity but the fiercely protected norm\u201d is hard to refute.</p> <p>In the 1950s, the distinguished American sociologist Edward Shils decided that the explanation lay with a&#xa0;ruling class that was \u201cunequalled in secretiveness and taciturnity\u201d, whose members were so close and comfortable with one another that they had little fear of hidden secrets. Cobain largely supports this view. Class deference combined with a relatively benign and trusting view of the state\u2019s behaviour may explain \u201cwhy the peculiarly uncommunicative nature of the British state does not provoke greater resentment and unease among the British public and media\u201d.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/edward-snowden\" title=\"\">Edward Snowden</a> is a case in point. When his disclosures about the UK and&#xa0;US governments\u2019 practice of mass electronic surveillance were published (first in the Guardian) in 2013, the reaction in Britain was mild compared with the outrage expressed in many other countries. Inter-newspaper jealousies, the conservatism of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/bbc\" title=\"\">BBC</a>, the rightwing nature of the British press: all these may have played a part in muting our concern. But it may also be that as a society we continue to believe in secrets and the people who make and guard them, despite everything Cobain reveals in this engrossing book.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>The History Thieves</em> by Ian Cobain is published by Granta.

It was a progressive move according to Kathryn Kase, executive director of the Texas Defender Service, a not-for-profit group that helps clients facing the death penalty.</p> <p>Kase represents <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2014/oct/30/texas-execution-date-mentally-ill-killer-scott-panetti\">Scott Panetti</a>, a mentally ill man who represented himself at trial dressed as a cowboy and tried to subpoena Jesus Christ, John F Kennedy and the pope.</p> <p>In fall 2014, Kase discovered that Panetti was scheduled to die in a little over a month when she read about it in a local newspaper.

  "<p>People are gathered around a bed in the emergency ward of Al-Sabeen children\u2019s hospital in Sana\u2019a, the Yemeni capital.

As we stand looking at Atan, another family rushes into the ward carrying a child of around six. Within seconds doctors are doing chest compressions and blowing oxygen into his mouth but it is clearly too late. Within seconds the cries of the child\u2019s mother fill the emergency ward.

It makes the whole process painfully slow.</p> <p>Food warehouses, storage silos and maintenance depots at the docks have also been hit.

We need to rely on you, but instead we are afraid of you.

We are your patients and we need you to support our health.\u201d</p> <p>Afterwards I received several anonymous messages from gynaecologists telling me that they will help Polish women, promising that they will work in their regions to tell the ruling party the truth about the real threat to women\u2019s health if a ban on abortion was passed. I have been seeking this kind of support for years, there are maybe five or 10 doctors in the whole of Poland who will speak out for women\u2019s rights, so for me this was a personal victory.</p> <p>Although the Catholic church is seemingly silent in Poland, we know it was the bishops who also rejected the stop abortion law, despite helping to instigate it in the first place.

We are expecting the church and the ruling party to prepare a compromise which would allow abortion when a woman has been raped, or there is a direct threat to her life, but they will seek to withdraw access to legal abortion if the fetus is damaged.</p> <p>We want women to be free to make a decision on whether she gives birth to a seriously sick child herself. It is her right to choose, and if she does choose to have the child we advocate that she should be supported economically and psychologically, but all women should not be pushed to give birth in such circumstances because the politicians have ruled it so.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Women make up the majority of the people who attend mass, who give money.

  "<p>Depending on your outlook, the fourth title in this muscle-bound sci-fi series could easily look like an anachronism. It\u2019s a single-path third-person cover-shooter that pays no heed to modern demands for open worlds, and belongs to a franchise that has looked somewhat jaded over the last few iterations. But Microsoft has cannily brought in a new developer, the Coalition, and it has administered a much-needed injection of fresh ideas, without compromising the core appeal.</p> <p>After a brief nostalgic prologue, Gears of War 4 takes place 25 years after the Locust were (apparently) finally defeated in Gears 3. The planet Sera has changed massively in that quarter-century; the COG have become the baddies, exercising fascistic control over the populace with the help of a robotic army known as DBs, even though the authoritarian female first minister (remind you of anyone?), Jinn, begins by paying lip-service to Marcus Fenix at a commemorative rally. You play as James \u201cJD\u201d Fenix, son of Marcus, who has gone Awol from the COG and hooked up with a bunch of \u201coutsiders\u201d living off-grid in a country village. Along with sidekick Del and Kait, the franchise\u2019s first properly central female character, JD embarks on a raid of a COG establishment with the aim of stealing a Fabricator \u2013 essentially a 3D printer with knobs on, which can make weapons and fortifications.</p> <p>The merry band \u2013 moving through a world which, at last, hasn\u2019t been entirely constructed using a colour palette of black, brown and grey \u2013 take on wave after wave of robots, using disappointingly weedy new weapons. But a change-up soon occurs: after returning to the outsider village and fending off a major COG assault (which seamlessly introduces the changes the Coalition has made to Gears of War\u2019s legendary horde mode), a new enemy, which JD and company dub the Swarm, appears, kidnapping Kait\u2019s mother, village headwoman, Reyna, and the rest of the village\u2019s inhabitants.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9a03cf74084af5c41b437d3aecfcc41fdcd28493\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9a03cf74084af5c41b437d3aecfcc41fdcd28493/410_0_4666_2800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gears hero Marcus Fenix bonds with his son JD in the only way he knows how: over a massive machine gun\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gears hero Marcus Fenix bonds with his son JD in the only way he knows how: over a massive machine gun</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Microsoft</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>So JD and his cohorts embark on another world-saving quest \u2013 and the first stop involves approaching the now-grizzled (but still gung-ho) Marcus Fenix who, rather unexpectedly, has opted for bucolic retirement in a country pile. Luckily, Marcus has his old COG gear, so at last you can reacquaint yourself with the trusty assault-rifle-cum-chainsaw Lancer and the Gnasher shotgun.</p> <p>In the quest to find Reyna and discover the truth about the Swarm, Sera\u2019s harsh climate occasionally intervenes: \u2018windflares\u2019 often strike, pairing beyond-hurricane-force winds with deadly localised lightning. In those sequences, impressive physics let you take out swathes of enemies by bringing the environment into play, and often add a puzzle-solving element. The Coalition has also thrown in some on-rails sequences, which are less successful, though: they simply feel too on-rails.</p> <p>There are, of course, boss battles, and the various forms of the Swarm force you to take a more tactical approach than in the past \u2013 although you still have to fill them full of unfeasible quantities of lead, albeit in a much less indiscriminate manner. So-called Juvies, for example, are quick and elusive but unarmed, so they will melee you if you stay behind cover while, entertainingly, Snatchers will swallow you up if you let them get too close, rendering you helpless until a team-mate shoots you out of their stomachs (you can play the campaign cooperatively, although the AI, controlling bot-based team-mates, is pretty good). Overall, the single-player campaign offers a much more varied, flowing experience than previous Gears of War games. It isn\u2019t the longest, though: those in a hurry could finish it in about nine hours.</p> <p>The game\u2019s real meat, however, lies online, with two major pillars in the form of versus multiplay and Horde 3.0 (the name reflecting the Coalition\u2019s desire to register that the much-loved survival mode has been extensively revamped). In versus, Gears of War\u2019s existing multiplayer modes make welcome returns, so you can plunge into warzone (team deathmatch with a single life per short-but-sweet round), team deathmatch (in which each team has an allocated number of lives), king of the hill and guardian. Plus there is the intriguing dodgeball, in which every time you kill an enemy, you allow a dead team-mate, consigned to a queue, to respawn.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"537ff28604209094f70a85772fe93ef6fa752865\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/537ff28604209094f70a85772fe93ef6fa752865/78_0_1874_1125/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The new Horde Mode adds an array of features to the co-op multiplayer favourite\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The new horde mode adds an array of features to the co-op multiplayer favourite</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Microsoft</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Another new mode, arms race, is likely to inspire either fanatical devotion or total indifference, as it forces you to cycle through all the game\u2019s weapons: every three kills, your team will swap to a new model. It\u2019s a great idea (one that we have seen variations on in the Call of Duty series, among others), but it also means you have to use the new DB weapons, which are vastly inferior to the original COG ones. Escalation, meanwhile is a new mode which has e-sports firmly on its agenda: it involves teams capturing three areas and ramps up respawn times at the end of each round.</p> <p>Social playlists allow you to jump into the multiplayer and sample various game types at a time, with the ability to vote for the next map and mode. There\u2019s an XP system which extends across both Versus and Horde 3.0, which is good, and a Gears Pack system which provides cards that bring some pretty appealing cosmetic enhancements for use in versus, along with bounties (which are specific challenges), and some really useful perks and buffs that can be applied in horde mode. We played the multiplayer side of the game extensively pre-launch, and things progressed pretty smoothly \u2013 matching problems won\u2019t arise as the game can strip in bots where needed \u2013 although we did experience one catastrophic crash at the end of a round. </p> <p>Gears of War 4 will kick off with 10 maps (all of which are impeccable) and more will be provided for free via DLC. Frame-rate issues and lag, mercifully, were completely absent. But you can never tell whether Microsoft\u2019s server network will be able to take the strain when everyone jumps online. If you\u2019re nervous, watch and wait before purchasing.</p> <p>Horde 3.0 chiefly benefits from the new mechanic provided by fabricators, which let you build things like electrified fences, automatic turrets and various levels of decoys. You can move your fabricator crate to whatever strategic place you feel you can best defend from the waves of incoming enemies, and the whole exercise adds a welcome new level of strategy to proceedings. But there is a caveat: Horde 3.0 also introduces classes, and you have to be very careful which you choose, as your class determines your load-out. You can, of course, pick up weapons from dead enemies, but pick the wrong class and you\u2019ll be forced to use the weedy DB weaponry, which is annoying. And the game doesn\u2019t offer anything like as much explanation of that as it should.</p> <p>Overall, Gears of War 4 may adhere to a seemingly old-fashioned template but, in practice, it feels anything but archaic. Its single-player campaign is much more varied and engaging than those of its predecessors and the online mode is exhilarating, catering for all shades of gamers, from the less adept to those with pro-gamer aspirations. The horde thoroughly deserves its 3.0 designation upgrade and as a whole, the fourth iteration gives the Gears of War template the rejuvenating shot in the arm it sorely needed. </p> <p><strong>The Coalition/Microsoft; Xbox One/PC; \u00a350; Pegi rating: 18</strong></p>",

Nothing is clear except that it is all going to be a lot trickier to disengage from the EU than some foolish people said \u2013 and still say despite mounting evidence to the contrary.</p> <p>So my starting point is one of humility as I learn stuff I didn\u2019t known before. It\u2019s safe to say that some things will be better outside the EU, others worse, some sectors and individuals will thrive, others languish. The consequences of Britain\u2019s leap in the dark \u2013 37% of the total electorate voted Brexit by a very slender margin \u2013 are still largely unknown for all 28 members states. Only charlatans and romantics pretend otherwise.</p> <p>I like to quote one of Fleet St\u2019s most celebrated columnists at this point. In an article published by the Telegraph on May 12 2013 he wisely wrote:<strong><em> <br></em></strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><em>If we left the EU, we would end this sterile debate and we would have to recognize that most of our problems are not caused by Brussels, but by chronic British short termism, inadequate management, sloth, low skills, a culture of easy gratification and underinvestment in both human and physical capital and infrastructure.\u201d</em></p> </blockquote> <p>Did Boris Johnson believe what he wrote then? It\u2019s never easy to tell when the man \u201cmost trusted\u201d by Brexit voters opens his mouth. But he was right. Whatever you regard as Britain\u2019s big mistakes in recent decades \u2013 poor bank regulation, Iraq, privatization, PFI, the failure to build new runways or HS2 \u2013 have been our own mistakes. Europe has mostly been the scapegoat.</p> <p>That is my chief fear for the future. However much \u201csovereignty\u201d ( let alone cash) we get back from Brussels in reality, however successful and sophisticated a deal we negotiate with generous-spirited EU leaders and new trading partners, it is all going to take a lot of time and effort. The City\u2019s insurance, for which the single market never worked well, will adapt and survive. Banks, UK tourism and farming may flourish while those Japanese car makers desert Sunderland for somewhere cheaper inside the Eurozone. Or they may not.<br></p> <p>But the process is bound to disappoint many people, Brexit voters as well as Remainers, because Brexit was oversold as a panacea. With no EU whipping boy to blame for things which were actually our own fault \u2013 eh, Boris !! \u2013 the search will start for new scapegoats ( some of them very old ones too). Populist politicians and cynical newspapers will encourage it to mask the failure of their predictions. Some people claim to detect such stirrings in this week\u2019s Tory conference speeches.</p> <p>I think that\u2019s premature and hope they\u2019re wrong. I also hope the Brexit optimists are triumphantly vindicated in their vision of a prosperous new Britain. But, like Boris before his Brexit flip flop, I have my doubts.<br></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57f64a00e4b03b0685c082f2\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/sarah-marsh\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-06T12:57:09.535Z\">1.57pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Thanks everyone</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>We will be wrapping up the debate in the next four minutes, but we welcome any final comments and remarks.</p> <p>We will keep comments open until 2.15pm</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57f64981e4b03b0685c082ef\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/james-walsh\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-06T12:56:21.776Z\">1.56pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">'Brexit is a disaster waiting to happen'</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>A view from Nigel Stern, who runs a design agency in London:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The biggest impact will hiring staff with the right skills.

Since Brexit I have noticed an uptick in sales to the United States, but I have noticed a distinct decline in sales to Europe, though they do still take place. The effect of Brexit on Europe\u2019s perception of Britain as a country is very negative - and the announcements from the Tory party conference will only reinforce the impression that Britain is not opening up for business. In fact, the very reverse: closing down for business and pursuing policies of discrimination against foreigners, especially from Europe. </p> <p>The level of discrimination against immigrants from Europe is most definitely alienating what should be Britain\u2019s closest friends. As someone with a slight foreign accent I no longer feel entirely safe in this country. A hard Brexit would be a disaster for me - as many books go abroad and the customs paperwork would add a considerable workload as well as extra costs in the case of more valuable books. There literally is not a single advantage to be derived from Brexit except for the lower pound, which could have been lowered by other means which would have done far less damage to Britain\u2019s economy and society.

  "<p>Dallas police investigating who shot Aqib Talib in Dallas this summer believe they\u2019ve found the culprit: and he\u2019s called Aqib Talib.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2016/oct/04/minnesota-vikings-super-bowl-contenders-nfl\">Don't look now, but the Vikings could be genuine Super Bowl contenders</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Broncos cornerback was shot in the leg in an early-morning incident on 5 June, and was taken to hospital. Talib said he couldn\u2019t remember who had shot him, but after a lengthy investigation police have concluded Talib himself fired the gun. Dallas police said Talib\u2019s attorney had provided a letter \u201cthat stated Aqib Talib admitted he shot himself accidentally.\u201d But they\u2019re continuing to investigate, they said. </p> <p>Reports in Dallas suggested police will not press charges against Talib, but he could still face punishment from the NFL under the league\u2019s personal conduct policy.</p> <p>On Wednesday, Talib said: \u201cI\u2019m not really worried about anything except for Atlanta right now.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I heard that report yesterday, I immediately got on my iPad and started watching Julio Jones,\u201d he said. \u201cI cannot even worry about it. I got my hands full with enough already. Like I said, it\u2019s still under review. I\u2019m not really going to talk about that right now.\u201d </p> <p>Talib, 30, avoided surgery and was released from the hospital the following day. The incident forced him to miss the Broncos\u2019 visit to the White House to commemorate their Super Bowl 50 victory.</p> <p>NFL spokesman Brian McCarthy told the Associated Press on Wednesday that Talib\u2019s case \u201cis under review of the personal conduct policy.\u201d Roger Goodell, the NFL commissioner, could yet decide to hand down a punishment.<br></p> <p>Talib, who has been involved in incidents with guns in the past, told police he was too drunk to recall details of the shooting. \u201cEverything was a blur,\u201d he reportedly said. According to the police report, Talib said he didn\u2019t know who shot him and that the bullet \u201centered into the rear of his right thigh then exited his right calf\u201d.</p> <p>Coach Gary Kubiak said on Wednesday the Broncos are \u201cjust moving forward, he\u2019s playing great, obviously having a heck of a year and (we\u2019re) expecting him to keep going.\u201d</p> <p>Team-mates aren\u2019t fretting either, suggested cornerback Chris Harris Jr.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s a weird situation,\u201d Harris said. \u201cYou never know what\u2019s going to happen. You never know what the NFL\u2019s going to do anytime, with any situation. Right now, he\u2019s not in jail. So, I mean, what can you do if he didn\u2019t go to jail? He didn\u2019t do anything wrong.\u201d</p> <p>After a three-month layoff, Talib returned to the field on 8 August. He\u2019s started all four of Denver\u2019s games and has three interceptions, one shy of his total from 2015 when he earned his third consecutive Pro Bowl berth.</p> <p>The Broncos, who are perfect through week four, host the Atlanta Falcons (3-1) on Sunday.</p>",
  "<p>By what legal authority do the National Security Agency and the FBI ask Yahoo to search its users\u2019 emails? Neither the government nor the tech company would say, after Reuters first reported on Tuesday that Yahoo \u201csecretly built a custom software program\u201d it used on behalf of the NSA and CIA to scan customer emails.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/oct/04/yahoo-secret-email-program-nsa-fbi\">Yahoo 'secretly monitored emails on behalf of the US government'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But technologists and legal experts say the source may have been a directive from the secret national security court authorized by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (Fisa), and not a wider digital dragnet.</p> <p>The government appears to have undertaken the program under the law in 2015 even as Congress was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/02/congress-surveillance-reform-edward-snowden\">attempting to roll back</a> surveillance of American citizens.</p> <p>It also appears very similar to programs the FBI uses to pursue child abusers.</p> <h2>No single court order can allow surveillance of millions of Americans</h2> <p>Further <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/06/technology/yahoo-email-tech-companies-government-investigations.html?_r=0\">reporting from the New York Times on Wednesday</a> said Yahoo was ordered to scan its emails \u201cfor the digital \u2018signature\u2019 of a communications method used by a state-sponsored, foreign terrorist organization\u201d.</p> <p>But scanning the entirety of its email service for a specific string would appear to be a major change in the way Fisa has operated, said Liza Goitein, co-director of the national security program at New York University\u2019s Brennan Center for Justice. </p> <p>\u201cA regular Fisa order, you have a specific target who is a US person or resident and you have to go to the Fisa court to get authorization with probable cause that they\u2019re foreign powers or agents of a foreign power,\u201d Goitein said. \u201cSo it\u2019s not meant for mass surveillance at all. If Fisa is being used for mass surveillance that creates a whole other problem.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s hard to see how the Fisc [foreign intelligence surveillance court] found that to be constitutional,\u201d she added.</p> <p>The other possible law in play is section 702 of Fisa, which the NSA used to justify its Prism program of dragnet surveillance. That law exclusively applies to persons located outside the United States, which would seem to preclude its use on all Yahoo subscribers, though it was used by the Bush administration to justify Prism.</p> <p>Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon said the possibility of yet another domestic spying program under Section 702 was untenable. \u201cIt is a fact that collection under Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act has a significant impact on Americans\u2019 privacy,\u201d he wrote in a statement. \u201cThe NSA has said that it only targets individuals under Section 702 by searching for email addresses and similar identifiers. If that has changed, the executive branch has an obligation to notify the public.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe government should be coming forward about this surveillance and whether the Fisc authorized this surveillance and issued an opinion explaining its rationale,\u201d said ACLU staff attorney Patrick Toomey. \u201cI think the public should demand this kind of transparency from their representatives.\u201d</p> <h2>A new use for an old method</h2> <p>But if the authority is new, the method is old. The FBI has for years demanded cooperation from email providers in its search for people who exploit children, and the system Yahoo uses to aid those investigations is effectively the same as the one described to the New York Times. In the case of Yahoo and child abuse images, software designed by Microsoft called PhotoDNA compares video and image files across Yahoo\u2019s email system to a database of images.</p> <p>If a match comes up, <a href=\"http://pilotonline.com/news/local/crime/email-searches-catch-criminals-concern-privacy-groups/article_a35b1cc9-4d2b-5a8a-82f1-36c8469e091c.html\">the user gets a knock on the door</a>. Other companies, such as Facebook, use PhotoDNA to identify images that violate their terms of service, <a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2016/09/13/technology/facebook-nude-photo-lawsuit/index.html\">not always with success</a>. A similar system appears to have searched Yahoo\u2019s servers for messages from suspected terrorists.</p> <p>There is tremendous legal pressure on tech companies to use PhotoDNA and similar systems to monitor user activity, ACLU technologist Chris Soghoian has often observed; a Bush-era law <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/id/27198621/ns/technology_and_science-security/t/isps-are-pressed-become-child-porn-cops/#.V_V-TTKZPBI\">makes it a felony for tech companies to fail to report</a> any \u201cactual knowledge\u201d of images of abuse. There is no such pressure to install systems that track digital signatures of suspected terrorists, but once any such system is in place, another is easier to install, Soghoian has said.</p> <p>\u201cOnce the technical infrastructure for automatically intercepting and examining user communications has been designed and deployed, service providers are not in a position to limit the extent to which they can be compelled to use it,\u201d Soghoian wrote in a section of his dissertation he posted on Twitter on Wednesday.</p> <p>The government appears to see no harm in these sorts of intrusions. Robert S Litt, general counsel for the US Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI), wrote in April that the fourth amendment was essentially outdated when it came to digital privacy. \u201cIf the government electronically scans electronic communications, even the content of those communications, to identify those that it is lawfully entitled to collect, and no one ever sees a non-responsive communication, or even knows that it exists, where is the actual harm?\u201d Litt wrote in <a href=\"http://www.yalelawjournal.org/forum/fourth-amendment-information-age#_ftnref30\">the Yale Law Journal</a>.</p> <p>It\u2019s difficult to know what the digital signature of a foreign terrorist group would look like unless members of that group were somehow already known to the US government or that group\u2019s networks were compromised. Terrorist operatives tend to try to work in as much anonymity as they can. The FBI has often used its knowledge of illegal communications to track the communicators.<br></p> <p>But images of abuse are illegal to possess and distribute; it\u2019s not illegal to talk to terrorists. \u201cIndividual Fisa orders are supposed to be narrowly targeted \u2013 the equivalent of search warrants \u2013 and this one required a scan of hundreds of millions of users\u2019 emails,\u201d said Goitein. </p> <p>The ODNI, the House judiciary committee, the Senate select permanent committee on intelligence, and the Senate judiciary committee did not return requests for comment. A spokesman for the House select permanent committee on intelligence declined to comment; a spokeswoman for the Senate judiciary committee said she had no new information. Yahoo did not comment.</p>",
  "<p>Some years ago I joined a delegation of Labour MPs to the European parliament. A member of the EU commission gave us some of his valuable time. \u201cThe British people are just going to have to learn to put up with freedom of movement,\u201d he said as he sat down.</p> <p>Everyone around me agreed. I remember thinking that the British people didn\u2019t have to put up with anything, not their politicians and certainly not their bureaucrats. But I said nothing. As a recently elected MP I did not have the confidence to interrupt the consensus. And besides, like all my colleagues, I supported freedom of movement.</p> <p>That consensus is now breaking down. Earlier in the summer I wrote about the fears of many Jeremy Corbyn supporters that without him Labour would race not simply to the right but to a fusion of Blairite managerialism and Farage populism.</p> <p>I thought those fears unjustified, a Corbynista version of <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/staggers/2016/08/labour-mp-any-other-job-jeremy-corbyn-would-have-faced-industrial-tribunal\" title=\"\">Project Fear</a>. But some are now arguing that, like Brexit, Project Fear is becoming Project Fact as Labour MPs argue for the party to walk away from freedom of movement and the home secretary proposes lists of \u201cforeign\u201d employees.</p> <p>It\u2019s not only in the UK. Across Europe the rise of the right has made comrades question the appetite for freedom of movement. While the tone and actual proposals differ, the message is often similar. The white working class has been ignored for too long. We need to check our privilege and check out of Europe.</p> <p>I don\u2019t know that much about privilege. I grew up like the white working class, with one obvious difference: I wasn\u2019t white. I\u2019m certainly in a position of immense privilege now, and that gives me a voice when it comes to my values, but it did not help form them. The white working class helped form my values.</p> <p>On North Kenton council estate, where I grew up, racism was a daily occurrence that marked me for life. But I also benefited from a huge amount of support from working-class friends, families and teachers. I learned abiding and entrenched views on fairness, the value of labour and the importance of solidarity. The values that caused Abraham Lincoln to thank \u201cthe working men of Manchester\u201d for their <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/from-the-archive-blog/2013/feb/04/lincoln-oscars-manchester-cotton-abraham\" title=\"\">solidarity against slavery</a>. The values that formed both the co-operative movement and the fair trade movement.</p> <p>When I was selected as candidate for Newcastle Central I said there was no doorstep in the city where I would not go. If someone was voting BNP or Ukip, I would listen and find out why. I learned that we have a huge job to do to regain the trust of many who have been betrayed by rising inequality, reduced demand for traditional skills and increased competition for certain types of work. There is real and justified anger at that betrayal.</p> <p>I can see that such anger might incline some comrades towards if not a flirtation with xenophobia then at least a wary two-step (\u201cLook, we\u2019re not touching, just moving to the mood music\u201d). They hope in so doing to shore up Labour\u2019s position as the party that speaks for the working class, the same reasoning that led the party to abstain on the second reading of the welfare bill last year. This latest dance is likely to be just as successful, but the impact on our reputation would be even worse.</p> <p>There are certainly arguments to be had about freedom of movement of people versus freedom of movement of exploitation and welfare. And there is much to be said for knowing what happens at our borders, and who comes in to the country and who is leaving it.</p> <p>But these arguments must be made from a position of strong support for free movement of people, the jobs it brings through access to the European market and the value those people add to our economy and our society. Without the free movement of people, the free movement of goods and capital isolates and dehumanises us, free trade without free people both commoditises our experience and makes us less resilient to global forces of change.</p> <p>This is toxic territory. It does not lend itself to \u201ctriangulation\u201d \u2013 particularly by those who have little familiarity with the working class they claim to represent. For too many, the working-class experience is an essay in anthropology, not a reality to be reflected \u2013 far less challenged or questioned.</p> <p>And even if we could triangulate it to try to win more votes, we should not. Labour party members have for the second time overwhelmingly demonstrated they want authenticity. On this subject the Tories can authentically outplay us every time, as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/toryconference\" title=\"\">this week has shown</a>.</p> <p>Ultimately no matter how many soundbites we drop, Labour is not going to be believed as the party that is tough on immigration. We can be believed as the party that is tough on the negative consequences of migration. But if we let our values dance to the tune of xenophobia, we will not be believed on anything.</p>",

These were Aleppo\u2019s darkest days of modern times \u2013 until the blitz of the past year.</p> <p>In early 2014, Isis was ousted by a rebel fightback, which again changed the character of the east. Since then, Islamists have competed with more mainstream groups for influence over territory. Control of access points to the north and south, meanwhile, has been contested between jihadists and mainstream units, with the former mostly dominant.</p> <p>They have not, however, been able to break a siege enforced by Shia militias from Iraq, Lebanon and Iran, which are allied to Assad and providing bombing targets for Russian jets.

Released in 1982, it was seen as a return to poppier territory after the slightly-all-over-the-place Tusk. The remastered version \u2013 in expanded and deluxe editions \u2013 is out now on Rhino.</p> <p>(3) Songbird was originally released as the B-side to Dreams, in 1977.

  "<p>It\u2019s one of the first things we do in the morning and one of the last we do at night. Yet brushing our teeth sees billions of plastic toothbrushes bound for the world\u2019s rubbish dumps and oceans every year. </p> <p>As important as good oral health is, must it be a source of pollution? Two decades ago, that question set Massachusetts-based Eric Hudson on a quest to produce the world\u2019s first recyclable plastic toothbrush. </p> <h2><strong>Recyclable handles</strong> </h2> <p>After months consulting dentists, scientists and engineers, the <a href=\"https://www.preserveproducts.com/shop/bath/oral-care\" rel=\"nofollow\">Preserve toothbrush</a> was born. The award-winning design has a handle made from recycled plastic \u2013 from discarded toothbrushes and yoghurt pots \u2013 and bristles manufactured from new nylon. <br></p> <p>\u201cA lot of big brands say that they don\u2019t see the \u2018purchase intent\u2019 among customers for recyclable toothbrushes,\u201d he says. \u201cBut for us, that\u2019s not the point: the point is to lighten the footprint of the product from the start.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"f3018f6d5443db5f7460f9848b30824fb0d3a1b5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f3018f6d5443db5f7460f9848b30824fb0d3a1b5/0_0_2000_3000/667.jpg\" alt=\"preserve toothbrusg\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Preserve toothbrush.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Preserve</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Preserve says it\u2019s now the top-selling US toothbrush in the country\u2019s $85.5bn (\u00a367bn) natural grocery market. The company\u2019s arched brushes can be found on the shelves of Walmart, Trader Joe\u2019s and a host of other mainstream retailers. Already operating in 18 global markets, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/b-corps-markets-corporate-law\">B Corp-certified</a> Preserve is currently looking to expand in Europe. <br></p> <p>Marking out the product is Preserve\u2019s commitment to so-called closed-loop manufacturing. The company currently operates a nationwide recycling campaign called <a href=\"https://www.preserveproducts.com/recycle/programs/gimme-5-program-171\" rel=\"nofollow\">Gimme 5</a>, which sees around 400 recycling bins placed in retail stores around the US. Consumers can use the bins (mostly located in Whole Foods stores) to return any polypropylene plastics, which are then recycled to make the toothbrush handle. </p> <p>Since 2008, the initiative has saved more than 500,000kg of plastic from going to landfill. To cover its collection costs, Preserve has a sponsorship deal with baby-food manufacturer Plum Organics and Danone-owned yoghurt brand Stonyfield Farm.</p> <p>\u201cToothbrushes get completely lost in the recycling process ... often they\u2019re destined [for] waste-to-energy or shipped overseas, so the Gimme 5 programme definitely has a lighter impact on the earth,\u201d says Hudson. </p> <p>He admits that finding a fully sustainable material for the brush\u2019s bristles is a struggle. Ideally, the company would like to find a biodegradable option \u2013 a quest that remains \u201cstill in the research lab\u201d. It currently uses virgin nylon, which is the \u201cbristle of choice\u201d among dental professionals but is not recycled.</p> <h2><strong>Bamboo brushes</strong></h2> <p>Another option for green-minded consumers is biodegradable toothbrushes. Instead of having to go to the trouble of recycling your brush when you\u2019re done with it (which only 10-20% of those who buy the Preserve Toothbrush actually do), you can just throw it on the compost heap.</p> <p>The overwhelming biodegradable material-of-choice is bamboo, given its natural tensile strength and its ability to grow fast. An early entrant into the market is the <a href=\"http://environmentaltoothbrush.com.au/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Environmental Toothbrush</a>, which retails at \u00a32.85 in the UK. Invented by a suburban dentist in Brisbane, Australia, it boasts a heat-treated carbonised surface that gives it a smooth finish \u2013 as well as stopping it going manky on the edge of your bathroom sink. </p> <p>You\u2019re unlikely to stumble on the Environmental Toothbrush or otherbiodegradable brushes (such as <a href=\"http://savesomegreen.co.uk/product/bamboo-toothbrush-2/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Save Some Green</a> and <a href=\"http://www.brushwithbamboo.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Brush with Bamboo</a>) on the high-street. Consumers have to either go hunting in specialist health stores or surf eco-ecommerce sites such as <a href=\"http://www.soapnuts.co.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Living Naturally</a> or <a href=\"http://www.boobalou.co.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Boobalou</a>. </p> <p>A rare exception is the <a href=\"http://www.humblebrush.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Humble Brush</a>, which UK supermarket Waitrose started selling at the beginning of the year. In addition to its environmental credentials (the handle is made from FSC-certified bamboo), the product\u2019s Swedish manufacturer <a href=\"http://www.humblesmile.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">pledges to donate</a> a free brush or the cost-equivalent in oral care for children living in vulnerable countries. </p> <p>\u201cThe production of plastic toothbrushes produces toxins and leaves a carbon footprint. But more importantly, they never biodegrade,\u201d says Noel Abdayem, a qualified dentist and founder of Humble Brush. </p> <h2><strong>Bio-brushes </strong></h2> <p>For those who aren\u2019t sold on the idea of plastic in any form (Humble Brush uses nylon-6 bristles), the current market options are even more restricted. James Cowles, managing director at the eco-product manufacturer Save Some Green, believes the future could lie with compostable plant-based plastics.</p> <p>\u201cDemand is getting to the stage where [a bioplastic solution] is going to have to happen. Look at the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/shortcuts/2016/aug/24/ban-on-microbeads-tiny-objects-massive-problem-environment-cosmetics\">ban on microbeads</a> and the amount of plastics going into the ocean. It\u2019s not good for the fish, and it\u2019s not good for us,\u201d Cowles says.<br></p> <p>One option for now is to go old-school and revert to the pre-nylon days of toothbrushes with bristles made from pig hair. Germany-based <a href=\"https://www.lifewithoutplastic.com/store/set-of-10-plastic-free-wooden-toothbrushes-for-adults.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Life without Plastic</a> offers just such a product. Its handle, which is made from sustainably-harvested beech wood, should further satisfy (non-vegan) eco-consumers. <br><br>Rachelle Strauss, founder of <a href=\"http://www.zerowasteweek.co.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Zero Waste Week</a>, says a shift to fully recyclable or biodegradable materials by Oral B, Colgate-Palmolive, Crest and the sector\u2019s other big brands is long overdue. As an immediate step, her advice is to go for a recyclable plastic brush with a comprehensive take-back scheme.</p> <p>\u201cThose already committed to buying green show a preference for biodegradable options,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I wonder if the average consumer is really ready to use a bamboo toothbrush.\u201d </p>",
  "<p>As the seasons change and even sunnier days arrive with that familiar autumnal nip in the air, I\u2019m reminded of how my polytunnel really comes into its own. This structure covered in a thin layer of plastic is now invaluable to my growing efforts, providing protection against the lashing rain we had last week in West Wales and affording greater resilience in the battle against <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/gardening-blog/2016/jan/15/it-wont-stop-raining-so-i-am-weatherproofing-my-garden\">extreme weather</a> that faces us for the foreseeable future. <br><br> It\u2019s no wonder that polytunnel growing is on the rise. They are a lot cheaper to buy than a greenhouse and relatively easy to put up yourself. If you can fit one in, they really do take your fruit and veg growing onto a whole new level, widening the range of what you can grow successfully in the first place: you\u2019ll be able to grow grapes, melons, cucumbers, peppers, aubergines and chillies. Plus it provides a delightful haven from the worst of the weather outside. </p> <p>If you\u2019re feeling tempted, spring is the best time to construct one in your garden or on your allotment, although there seem to be lots of discounts around now, so out of season may be a cheaper time to buy. You\u2019ll need to situate your polytunnel carefully: a sunny spot on a level area with some protection from wind is preferable. As long as it isn\u2019t more than 3m tall and doesn\u2019t take up more than 50% of your garden, or cause an issue for your neighbours, <a href=\"https://www.northernpolytunnels.co.uk/blog/polytunnel-planning-permission\">planning permission</a> is not normally required. If in doubt though, do check with your local planning department first. <br><br> Here are just some of the ways you will stand to benefit: </p> <p><strong>Year-round salads</strong> A polytunnel opens up a world of winter salad opportunities that you\u2019d be hard-pushed to experience otherwise. More delicate lettuces and leaves will be better quality and keep going that bit longer, while hardier kales, chard, mustards, cresses, chicories, spinach, parsley and mizuna will keep you in exciting leaves for many months to come. If you\u2019re quick, hardier salad plugs can still be planted out now. You can also try cutting back summer lettuces to reduce the risk of mildew and encourage slow winter growth. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"89a927616332b6bf9d268b7d95b9ceb8fcaddb19\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/89a927616332b6bf9d268b7d95b9ceb8fcaddb19/0_0_2144_1286/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Picking grapes in the polytunnel\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Owning a polytunnel can open up a whole new range of crops, including grapes.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kim Stoddart</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Earlier crops</strong> With a polytunnel, the so-called hungry gap in spring isn\u2019t as noticeable, as many crops including new potatoes, spring cabbage, peas, salad and beans won\u2019t be far off at all. There is still time to germinate pea and broad bean seeds to enable you to overwinter plants for a real head-start come spring. </p> <p><strong>No need to be just a fair weather gardener</strong> No matter how dire the weather, you can garden or just sit and relax in your polytunnel. After the appalling weather last winter I\u2019ve added a deckchair and little seating area in mine now \u2013 it really is a little sanctuary. Simply lay a weed suppressant layer covered with gravel over your chosen spot. This is the quickest (and one of the cheapest) ways to go about it. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ce332e7340103ae00cee8ba85eb844fbcaaa170e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ce332e7340103ae00cee8ba85eb844fbcaaa170e/0_0_1545_927/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bumper strawberry crops inside a polytunnel\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">In a good year, Kim Stoddart gets a bonus second batch of strawberries from her polytunnel plants.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kim Stoddart</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Best for strawberries</strong> I\u2019ve never had a great deal of luck with strawberries grown outside. As soon as they near ripeness, birds, slugs and insects descend to munch on the majority of the crop before I can get stuck in. Inside is a completely different matter, with a bumper harvest each time. In good years we sometimes get a bonus second batch of strawberries from our plants later in the season, too. Now is a good time to get runners established; do so by carefully placing the new plants in pots with fresh multipurpose compost still attached to the parent plant. </p> <p><strong>Growing flexibility</strong> Even in an unheated polytunnel such as mine, you can still sow seeds significantly earlier than you would do otherwise. I also keep a large home-made unheated propagator on the potting bench to further aid germination and protect seedlings from the cold (and the polytunnel mice). Likewise, you can also sow a bit later than you would do normally, as the growing season is extended on both sides, providing all round greater flexibility. Plants such as cucumber, tomato and melon can produce fruit well into November and sometimes December depending on how cold it gets, so it\u2019s well worth leaving them in the ground. </p> <p><strong>A helping hand for harder-to-grow crops</strong> I\u2019d be hard pushed to grow decent tomatoes, cucumbers or peppers in my garden in West Wales without some form of cover. It also gives me room to experiment with more adventurous produce. The key here is making sure your polytunnel is clean inside and out to ensure your plants get as much light as possible, especially this time of year. </p> <p><strong>Seed saving</strong> If you\u2019d like to extend your seed saving efforts, a polytunnel will help immensely. It allows you to safely overwinter more sensitive biennials such as carrots, parsley, beetroot and swede so they can successfully flower and set seed the following year. Now is a good time to take a few tomatoes, peas, french beans, cucumbers and the like and bury them in the ground so they can spring into action when they\u2019re ready the following year. This really is lazy gardening at its best.</p> <p><strong>Winter protection for container plants</strong> Potted herbs such as rosemary, parsley, sage and thyme will benefit from being brought inside, rewarding you for their shelter with more opportunities for winter pickings. While any more sensitive plants can also benefit from being given a barrier against the elements. Just bring them inside and remember to keep watering.<br></p> <ul> <li> <strong>For more resilient gardening ideas and antics see </strong><a href=\"http://www.getbadlybehaved.com/\"><strong>getbadlybehaved.com</strong></a><strong> or </strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/badlybehavedone\"><strong>@badlybehavedone</strong></a> </li> </ul>",

I also tried while listening to audiobooks \u2014 also without success. But somehow the game enables me to forget the pain enough to keep walking for literally miles. I\u2019d say I\u2019m averaging about 4.5 miles a day.

  "<p>The UK has one of the lowest proportions of female judges on its benches, according to a comparative study of judicial systems across Europe.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.coe.int/t/dghl/cooperation/cepej/evaluation/default_2016_en.asp\">report by the Council of Europe</a>, published on Thursday, shows that the systems with the lowest percentage of women among professional judges were Azerbaijan (11%), Armenia (23%), Northern Ireland (23%), Scotland (23%), England &amp; Wales (30%) and Ireland (33%). The Europe-wide average was 51%.</p> <p>By comparison, the European court of human rights in Strasbourg \u2013 repeatedly criticised by Theresa May and Eurosceptics \u2013 has a relatively good record on gender diversity compared with most international courts. Currently 17 out of the 47 ECHR judges are women (36%).<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>The report is the latest in a series of regular reviews of the quality, cost and efficiency of justice across the 47 member nations of the organisation, which includes Russia and Turkey. Belarus is the only European state not to be a member.</p> <p>The confirmation of the gender imbalance in British courts comes days after the justice secretary, Liz Truss, pledged at the Conservative party conference to improve diversity in the legal profession.</p> <p>Britain\u2019s common law procedures are significantly different from most of the continent, where judge-led inquisitorial systems are dominant. In most of Europe, lawyers choose to specialise as judges at the beginning of their careers rather than towards the end; women are more easily recruited straight out of law school before they face the possible career disruption of starting a family.</p> <p>\u201cIn some states,\u201d the report notes, \u201cthe difference is explained by the relatively recent feminisation of the judiciary, whose effects are currently more noticeable [in the lower courts] than at second instance and in the supreme court. In Montenegro, female judges are a majority at all levels, as they are in Bosnia-Herzegovina. In Romania [where 74% of the judiciary are female], the percentage of women increases with each instance.\u201d</p> <p>At the Conservative conference, Truss said: \u201cCurrently, only one in seven of QCs and one in three of partners in law firms are women. Fewer than one in 10 judges come from ethnic minorities. Only a quarter went to state school. This is modern Britain \u2013 we can do better than this.\u201d </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"73d6b3670260b2a1818e0cdcf2c6b75e1598288d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/73d6b3670260b2a1818e0cdcf2c6b75e1598288d/0_89_5130_3077/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Liz Truss at the Tory party conference\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Liz Truss promised to boost diversity in the legal profession at the Conservative conference.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: James Gourley/Rex</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Only one out of the 12 justices on the supreme court, she pointed out, is a woman and none is from a minority ethnic background. \u201cThis would be difficult to justify in any boardroom or around the cabinet table.\u201d The justice secretary did not, however, introduce any measures to rectify the problem.</p> <p>Commenting on the shortage of female judges, Chantal-Aim\u00e9e Doerries QC, chair of the Bar Council, said: \u201cThe lord chancellor\u2019s decision to put diversity high on the agenda reflects [our] priorities. We all want to see greater career progression for women and BAME lawyers and judges. The bar and the judiciary need to reflect society at large.</p> <p>\u201cAt the bar we have a number of initiatives already under way, including several mentoring schemes. One of these is aimed at supporting women and ethnic minority barristers seeking to become QCs and members of the judiciary. We also recently launched a maternity mentoring scheme, open to fathers and mothers with children to help balance parenting with a flourishing career at the bar.\u201d</p> <p>The Council of Europe report also showed that some of the highest-paid supreme court judges in Europe are in the UK when their salaries, \u00a3215,000 a year, are compared against national average gross incomes. For England and Wales, the ratio was 7.7 times the national gross salary. Only Ukraine, with a ratio of 8.5, was higher. </p> <p>The lowest number of professional judges for every 100,000 inhabitants in 2014 were recorded in Ireland (three), England &amp; Wales (three), Scotland (three) and Northern Ireland (four); the Europe-wide average is 21. That disparity is due to the fact that the continent\u2019s inquisitorial system employs far more judges per head of population and consequently spends far less on legal aid for defendants and claimants than the UK adversarial system. </p> <p>The relatively high spend of legal aid in the UK is regularly seized on by ministers as proof that legal aid is excessively generous and should be cut further. According to the report, legal aid per capita spent in Northern Ireland in 2014 was \u20ac73.53 (\u00a364.67) \u2013 by far the highest recorded. It was \u20ac38.14 in England &amp; Wales, \u20ac33.28 in Scotland, \u20ac18.45 in the Republic of Ireland; the Europe-wide average was \u20ac8.64.</p>",
  "<p>Spot the difference.

Onshore windfarms, proven to be low-cost and low-carbon, get undermined by the government, with <a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/briefing-papers/sn04370.pdf\">local opposition given power to block applications</a>.</p> <p>The decision by the communities secretary, Sajid Javid, to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/06/uk-fracking-given-go-ahead-as-lancashire-council-rejection-is-overturned\">overturn Lancashire council\u2019s rejection of Cuadrilla\u2019s plan</a> to drill four fracking wells in the county is, therefore, nothing short of hypocrisy. </p> <p>It is a vital win for the nascent UK shale gas industry. But these are merely the opening skirmishes. To really know if fracking can provide significant gas for the UK, hundreds - if not thousands - of wells need to be drilled. Given the hand-to-hand combat that accompanies <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/may/23/north-yorkshire-council-backs-first-uk-fracking-tests-for-five-years\">even single wells</a> at the moment, the frackers still have an uphill struggle.</p> <p>But the government has their back. It has promised <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/06/fracking-local-people-payments-theresa-may\">cash handouts to local people</a> in fracking areas: compensation or bribes, depending on your point of view. Yet why are the same incentives not offered for windfarms? A key underlying reason for opposition to turbines is the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/mar/01/local-opposition-onshore-windfarms-tripled\">feeling of invasion of a community</a> which derives no benefit from the development.</p> <p>Ministers cannot say they did not know. The <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/public-attitudes-tracking-survey-wave-17\">government\u2019s own public opinion poll</a> shows nearly eight in 10 people agree that renewable energy developments should provide direct benefits to the communities in which they are located. The poll also shows 81% in support of renewables, with 4% against. Contrast that with fracking: 19% in favour and 31% against, with the rest undecided.</p> <p>So why does the government persist? The heady fracking fumes drifting across the Atlantic from the US, where shale oil and gas have transformed the energy market, are intoxicating. Ministers initially argued that fracking in the UK would cut energy bills, only to discover than <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/21/uk-advertising-watchdog-admits-it-was-wrong-to-ban-greenpeace-fracking-advert?CMP=share_btn_tw\">no one else agreed with them</a>. </p> <p>The US is huge, relatively sparsely populated and loosely regulated: a fracker\u2019s dream. Europe is the opposite, meaning shale gas is unlikely to make more than small dent in its integrated gas market, particularly given widespread opposition across the continent. Shale gas could cost double to produce in Europe compared to the US, experts estimate.</p> <p>This makes the energy department\u2019s mantra - keeping bills low for hardworking families - another piece of hypocrisy. Backing fracking that won\u2019t lower bills, while crushing low-carbon wind power, which will.</p> <p>If not lower bills, then how about more secure energy supplies? North Sea gas is running out and a few thousand shale gas wells could significantly offset that. Such a shale gas boom would be needed to make the industry economic. </p> <p>But, perversely, this could actually decrease energy security, <a href=\"http://www.ey.com/Publication/vwLUAssets/Shale_gas_in_Europe_revolution_or_evolution/$File/EY-Shale_gas_in_Europe-revolution_or_evolution.pdf\">according to analysts E&amp;Y</a>: \u201cA shale gas boom in Europe could, in practice, weaken energy security in Europe through over-reliance on a single energy source.\u201d A smart mix of renewables, efficiency, storage and interconnectors, as backed by the government\u2019s own <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/smart-power-a-national-infrastructure-commission-report\">National Infrastructure Commission</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.carbonbrief.org/national-grid-sees-major-boost-for-solar-electric-vehicles-and-batteries\">National Grid</a> and industry group <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/feb/28/top-lobbying-group-green-energy-u-turn\">Energy UK</a>, could deliver security cleanly and cheaply.</p> <p>How about shale gas as a low-carbon fuel, as touted by its backers? Gas is only relatively low carbon if it replaces coal. But coal in the UK is<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/04/solar-outstrips-coal-in-past-six-months-of-uk-electricity-generation\"> already dwindling fast</a>, before serious fracking has even begun, and the government has pledged a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/nov/18/energy-policy-shift-climate-change-amber-rudd-backburner\">complete coal phase out by 2025</a>. </p> <p>Furthermore, the government\u2019s official advisers, the Committee on Climate Change, say the UK\u2019s electricity system must be all but decarbonised by 2030. That\u2019s gives just a 16-year window for the ramping up and closing down of a fracking industry that\u2019s still in nappies, unless carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology comes to the rescue to bury emissions - and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/nov/25/uk-cancels-pioneering-1bn-carbon-capture-and-storage-competition\">government binned its flagship CCS policy</a> in November.</p> <p>Javid\u2019s decision shows the government remains unwavering in its support for unproven, climate-polluting and unpopular fracking, whilst cracking down on proven, clean and popular renewables. The fight to deliver a smart energy policy is tough enough - supplies must be simultaneously affordable, clean and secure - without shooting yourself in the foot.</p>",

That\u2019s much better support than I can get here. These grants are specifically aimed at bringing established people back. Without that it makes it more difficult for people to come back.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be going back just to kill myself eating high table dinners at a college,\u201d he added. \u201cThe ERC made it much more attractive.\u201d</p> <p>Haldane called for scientists to be given a protected status for visas, although he told the Guardian that he did not share some scientists\u2019 broader fears about a potential future clampdown on immigration in Britain. \u201cThere is clearly a need to be able to attract the top scientists and it goes without saying that complicated paperwork is going to put people off,\u201d he said.</p> <p>A second scientist, Sir Fraser Stoddart, the Scottish chemist who was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/oct/05/nobel-prize-chemistry-2016-jean-pierre-sauvage-jean-pierre-sauvage-bernard-feringa-nano-machines\">awarded the Nobel prize on Wednesday</a>, said that government plans to crackdown on immigration could be a deterrent for the best British scientists as well as those from abroad. \u201cI am very disturbed by the talk coming out of the UK at the moment,\u201d he said. \u201cAnything that stops the free movement of people is a big negative for science.\u201d</p> <p>He said that he has even advised young scientists to consider looking outside the UK in the future, due to fears that British science may enter a period of decline.</p> <p>\u201cI would have a plan B if I was a young scientist in Britain,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to be good news for British science. There are a lot of things that, particularly as a Scottish person, you can\u2019t make your mind up about. But there\u2019s no doubt in my mind about this. I do feel very strongly about it.\u201d</p> <p>Haldane\u2019s move the US in the 1980s was prompted by the Thatcher government squeezing funding for curiousity-driven scientific research. \u201cThere was a depressing atmosphere in British science at the time because of stupid government ideas that one should do something \u2018useful\u2019,\u201d he said. </p> <p>\u201cThey wanted to fund research into turbulence in North Sea gas pipes - an idea that I found pretty depressing.\u201d</p> <p>Stoddart moved from Birmingham to the University of California Los Angeles in 1997, where he succeeded a past Nobel laureate, Donald Cram, in a prestigious chemistry professorship.</p> <p>In her conference speech in Birmingham on Wednesday, the prime minister cited Britain\u2019s Nobel successes in science as a source of national pride. \u201c[Britain is] a successful country - small in size but large in stature - that with less than 1% of the world\u2019s population boasts more Nobel laureates than any country outside the United States\u2026 with three more added again just yesterday \u2013 two of whom worked here in this great city.\u201d</p> <p>UK universities currently get about \u00a31.2 billion research funding a year from the EU. Switzerland and Israel both \u201cbuy in\u201d to allow their scientists access to ERC grants, but Swiss participation is in jeopardy because of proposals to limit free movement of EU citizens into the country.<br></p> <p>Stoddart said that in his own research group, at Northwestern University, Illinois, he had scientists and students from more than a dozen different countries. \u201cWe get on extremely well regardless of background,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have this unity based on shared pursuit of science.\u201d<br></p> <p>Stoddart said that early in his career, at Sheffield University, he faced some criticism for recruiting from abroad. \u201cI got colleagues saying \u2018Don\u2019t you know that our people are better?\u2019\u201d he said. But he argues that recruiting from a wider pool and bringing in talent from abroad raises everyone\u2019s standards - an approach that is now widely accepted in the scientific world.</p> <p>\u201cWhen you get people from Messina or Madrid moving to a cold place like Sheffield, they\u2019re serious about science,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s better for everyone.\u201d</p> <p>Sir Martin Rees, emeritus professor of physics at the University of Cambridge, and the Astronomer Royal, said: \u201cThe UK scientific scene is now much stronger than it was [in the 1980s] - thanks in part of the strengthening of science on mainland Europe.

  "<p>The puzzle that is currently frustrating the pundit minds of America is this: why is Hillary Clinton not simply clobbering Donald Trump? How is this ranting, seething buffoon still competitive with her? Trump has now stumbled through a series of the kind of blunders that break ordinary political campaigns \u2013 the sort of deadly hypocrisies that always kill the demagogue in old movies \u2013 and yet this particular demagogue keeps on trucking. Why?</p> <p>Let us answer that burning pundit question of today by jumping to what will undoubtedly be the next great object of pundit ardor: the legacy of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/19/yes-tried-barack-obama-legacy-gary-younge\">President Barack Obama</a>. Two months from now, when all the TV wise men are playing historian and giving their estimation on where Obama ranks in the pantheon of the greats, they will probably neglect to mention that his legacy helped to determine Hillary\u2019s fortunes in this election cycle. As a beloved figure among Democrats, for example, Obama was instrumental in securing the nomination for her. As a president who has accomplished little since 2011, however, Obama has pretty much undermined Clinton\u2019s ability to sell us on another centrist Democratic presidency. His legacy has diluted her promise.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The reform impulse just keeps short-circuiting every time the Democrats try to switch it on</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Let me put this slightly differently. Hillary Clinton has lots of good policy ideas. She promises many fine things. That these things do not attract more voters to her side is (as many have noted) partially due to her wonkish way of presenting them. But it is even more because of the glaring contradiction between the nice things she says she will do and the failure of Obama to advance the ball very far on those same issues.</p> <p>I was pleased to learn, for example, that this year\u2019s Democratic platform includes strong language on antitrust enforcement, and that Hillary Clinton <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/05/upshot/liberal-economists-think-big-companies-are-too-powerful-hillary-clinton-agrees.html\">has hinted</a> she intends to take the matter up as president. Hooray! Taking on too-powerful corporations would be healthy, I thought when I first learned that, and also enormously popular. But then it dawned on me: antitrust enforcement is largely up to the president and his picked advisers. If Democrats really think it is so damned important, why has Clinton\u2019s old boss Barack Obama done so very, very little with it?</p> <p>Or take this <a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/news/clinton-expected-hit-wells-fargo-speech-bad-corporate-040652414--sector.html?ref=gs\">headline </a>from just a few days ago: \u201cClinton promises to hold Wells Fargo accountable\u201d. Go get \u2018em, Hillary! To see a president get tough with elite bankers and with CEOs in general \u2013 that\u2019s something we can all cheer for. But then that nagging voice piped up again: if Democrats think it is so critical to get tough with crooked banksters, why oh why didn\u2019t Barack Obama take the many, many opportunities he had to do so back in the days when it would have really mattered?</p> <p>Where this contradiction gets particularly toxic is on the issue of trade. This is the locomotive of dissatisfaction that Trump means to ride into the White House, and Clinton has tried desperately to neutralize the issue by announcing that she, too, opposes the hated TPP and that she, too, deplores the unfortunate effects certain trade deals have had. And then you open the newspaper and find that her presidential patron and protector, Barack Obama, is <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/05/business/international/obama-trade-tpp.html?_r=0\">still</a> pushing the TPP in order to secure his legacy.</p> <p>The reform impulse just keeps short-circuiting every time the Democrats try to switch it on. They talk about healthcare \u2013 and immediately have to say things like <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/hillary-clinton-obamacare-heck-lot-starting-scratch/story?id=42567432\">this</a> about Obamacare: \u201cIt\u2019s a heck of a lot better than starting from scratch.\u201d They talk about getting college tuition under control \u2013 and everyone remembers that the problem is decades old and that the Dems have done virtually nothing about it all those years. What was without a doubt the worst moment of them all came at the Democratic convention back in July, when Senator Elizabeth Warren <a href=\"http://time.com/4421731/democratic-convention-elizabeth-warren-transcript-speech/\">pronounced</a> on the current state of middle America as follows:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Look around. Americans bust their tails, some working two or three jobs, but wages stay flat. Meanwhile, the basic costs of making it from month to month keep going up. Housing, healthcare, child care \u2013 costs are out of sight. Young people are getting crushed by student loans. Working people are in debt. Seniors can\u2019t stretch a social security check to cover the basics.</p> </blockquote> <p>It was a powerful indictment of what Warren called a \u201crigged\u201d system \u2013 except for one thing: that system is presided over by Barack Obama, a man that same Democratic convention was determined to apotheosize as one of the greatest politicians of all times.</p> <p>It doesn\u2019t really help matters to claim, as the most ardent Obama defenders do, that the president was powerless before Congress, and that it was therefore impossible for Obama to do anything differently than he did during his eight years. Such fanciful talk may help us to feel better about the current occupant of the Oval, but it also negates his would-be successor\u2019s promises more effectively than any lesser argument you might make against them. It transforms a vote for Hillary from mildly distasteful to almost totally futile.</p> <p>The immediate problem for Democrats this year is simple, really: it is hard to criticize power when your own leader is the most powerful person in the land.</p> <p>The larger problem facing them is the terminal irrelevance of their great, overarching campaign theme. Remember the \u201cman from Hope\u201d? \u201cHope is on the way\u201d? \u201cKeep hope alive\u201d? Well, this year \u201chope\u201d is most assuredly dead. Thanks to Obama\u2019s flagrant hope-dealing in the dark days of 2008 \u2013 followed up by his failure to reverse the disintegration of the middle class \u2013 this favorite Democratic clich\u00e9 has finally become just that: an empty phrase. Today as the Democrats go into battle against Trump, they find that their rallying cry has lost its magic. Hillary is discovering how difficult it is to win an election without hope.</p>",
  "<p>There are now more self-employed people than ever before.

And they don\u2019t have access to other employee benefits. There is also some suggestion that they are untreated unfairly when it comes to key financial products such as loans, mortgages and insurance.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Last week, the government launched a review (<a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/oct/01/theresa-may-hires-former-tony-blair-policy-boss-to-review-workers-rights\">to be carried out by Matthew Taylor</a>, former head of Tony Blair\u2019s policy unit) to examine the changing world of work with a clear remit to examine the growth of self-employment. Mike Cherry, chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses, says the policy environment has simply \u201cnot kept pace\u201d with the modern nature of work. \u201cWe will be contributing to the review to make progress on maternity allowance, pension access, collective income insurance models and a new definition of self-employment,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Hayley Smith, founder of Boxed Out PR, believes the self-employed should have better holiday, sickness and <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/small-business-network/2016/feb/15/self-employed-women-disadvantaged-by-maternity-leave-says-report\">maternity rights</a>. \u201cThe government needs to consider implementing the same, or similar benefits for the self-employed as employed people,\u201d she says. </p> <p>Smith, who is self-employed, recently spent a week in hospital but felt she needed to keep working despite her ill health and worked from her laptop in her sick bed. \u201cI had to work while in hospital so I still got paid. I\u2019ve been diagnosed with ectopic endometriosis. I was in a lot of pain.\u201d<br tabindex=\"-1\"><br tabindex=\"-1\">Smith says the Taylor review should look into sickness pay and protection. \u201cWe are still humans who need to recover, and shouldn\u2019t have to worry about finances and work situation, especially when someone has a serious illness and needs genuine recovery time. It isn\u2019t right.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/small-business-network/2016/aug/31/freelancer-what-rate-charge-price-work\">The toughest question for a freelancer: what rate should I charge?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Sara Tomaszewska, managing director of social media agency Little Media Bureau in Birmingham, agrees. \u201cThe reality is that once you\u2019re self employed you don\u2019t take sick days. You work when you\u2019re ill because if you take a day off you don\u2019t earn money. I think everyone can relate to this. If we could have at least a few paid holidays or sick days, it would make our lives a lot easier and less stressful.\u201d</p> <p>Tomaszewska set up her business two years after leaving university, and while she loves her freedom, she suggests that many who choose self-employment do so because they had no other choice. \u201cNowadays even if you are a graduate it\u2019s difficult to find a full-time position in your field.\u201d</p> <p>Darren Fell, the CEO and founder of Crunch, a cloud accountancy firm in Brighton, hopes the review will bring greater understanding about the needs of the self-employed. He describes how he struggled to get a mortgage. \u201cIt took me nearly a year to navigate the process, despite running a successful business. When I founded Crunch seven years ago, I reinvested the money made from the sale of my previous business, Pure 360. Crunch was scaling rapidly every day, as we took on more clients and team members. Yet as the major stakeholder of a business in its startup phase, I was deemed too risky and nobody was prepared to lend to me.\u201d</p> <p>While many self-employed people believe the government could do more to support them, it also has to tread a fine line. The self-employed are not always in favour of greater government regulations, indeed business lobbies spend significant time campaigning against \u201cred tape\u201d. Businesses owners enjoy the thrill of going it alone and the freedom it entails. Jordan Marshall, policy manager at freelancer association IPSE, says freelancers enjoy flexibility at work. \u201cFrom being your own boss to having the flexibility to pick and choose the clients you work for, there are many reasons to take the leap into the world of self-employment.\u201d<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/01/i-tell-theresa-may-working-lives-review-modern-employment-zero-hours-flexibility\">I\u2019ll tell Theresa May what\u2019s wrong with modern work | Matthew Taylor</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But starting-up can be tough and growing a business when finance is in short supply is regularly cited as a major problem. Callum Griffiths is the managing director of family owned Clydach Farm Group, which has revenues of \u00a31.8m. However, he is just 17 and unable to access funding in his own right. Although he is arguably a rare case, he argues that any entrepreneur without a long trading history is disadvantaged. \u201cObtaining finance remains out of the question for many budding entrepreneurs. Younger entrepreneurs will not have a credit history or any assets which makes it practically impossible to secure funding from banks and loan agencies. Overall, there seems to be no legislation in place to support entrepreneurs under 18 with regards to PAYE, the inability to take on your own employees or register as a director with Companies House.\u201d</p> <p>Late payment is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/small-business-network/2016/oct/05/small-business-minister-late-payments-are-an-outrage\">another long-standing issue among small businesse</a>s and so far government initiatives have failed to deliver. Lawrie Jones, managing director of marketing company 42group, said: \u201cwe have been affected by our inability to enforce debt management on clients who haven\u2019t paid us. We have one instance where we spent hundreds chasing after a client who was able to elude us. This left us significantly out of pocket with no recourse for further action,\u201d he says. </p> <p>Many of the UK\u2019s worst payers are big companies which actually win government contracts. There have been calls for them to be stripped of this right, if they fail to pay their suppliers on time. Furthermore, government is also criticised for failing to support smaller companies through its procurement practices. Jones\u2019 42group has worked regularly for government agencies, but says winning the work is time consuming. \u201cIt\u2019s often interesting and challenging work, but they make it very hard for small businesses to break through - either as a result of stringent contract conditions, lengthy forms or long payment schedules.\u201d</p> <p>While the idea of running a company has gained in popularity, in other quarters business has been getting a bad name. Scandals at household names such as BHS and Sports Direct have prompted calls for greater protection for staff. Meanwhile, major companies such as Uber and courier company Deliveroo have been accused of abusing its \u201cself-employed\u201d workforce.

This is unacceptable but such cases do not indicate a problem with self-employment per se, but a problem with employers shirking their responsibilities in providing basic rights.\u201d </p> <p>Sinead Hasson, founder of the 10-strong recruitment company Hasson Associates, welcomes the review of regulations, but says small business must not be punished for the sins of larger companies. \u201cI think there should be some areas where SMEs can have options.

  "<p>A muscle-heavy man sits, staring unsmiling at the camera, on a throne of yellow plastic water cans.

According to Ghanaian tradition, a mother\u2019s belongings are locked away for a year after her death and then distributed to her daughters and other women in the family. </p> <p>As an only son, Clottey had no sister to inherit these belongings and so would have lost the very fabric of his mother\u2019s memory.

Tapestries and sculptures made from these objects are intended to highlight Ghana\u2019s water crisis and soaring levels of pollution. But, twinned with his mother\u2019s clothes, the cans also said something interesting about female domesticity, duty and daily life. \u201cMy mother was collecting the plastic gallon cans for me when she was alive,\u201d says Clottey. \u201cThey are of the streets, they\u2019re everywhere, but they are related to women because most of the time they\u2019re the ones who collect water.

The notion that they should be required to privatize their utility \u2013 I have not seen the state take that action previously.\u201d<br></p> <p>Advocates of public water were blunt about the loan\u2019s terms.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s undemocratic and un-American,\u201d said Mary Grant, a water privatization expert at Food &amp; Water Watch, an advocacy group that monitors corporate water takeover attempts.</p> <p>\u201cThe relationship to Flint is very compelling,\u201d Grant said. \u201cAn emergency manager came in and made decisions about the water system against the wishes of the local elected officials, and that resulted in the Flint water crisis, because they put money before health and human lives.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f00364334ef2d2e6039106d5c652ef1853cb262b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f00364334ef2d2e6039106d5c652ef1853cb262b/0_93_2600_1560/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Atlantic City Mayor Don Guardian waves at a local walking the boardwalk as he passes the huge shuttered Revel casino.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Atlantic City Mayor Don Guardian waves at a local walking the boardwalk as he passes the huge shuttered Revel casino.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael S Williamson/The Washington Post</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Customers of private water companies routinely <a href=\"http://www.commondreams.org/newswire/2016/02/16/new-rate-survey-500-us-water-systems-finds-private-water-providers-charge-58\">pay more for water</a>, and under privatization the people of Atlantic City would lose democratic control of their water and rates, as the people of Flint did when an emergency manager made <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jan/16/flints-water-crisis-what-went-wrong\">broad changes to the city\u2019s source water</a> in 2014 that resulted in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/24/flint-children-water-crisis-lack-of-data-lead\">widespread lead contamination</a>. </p> <p>A change in source water is unlikely in Atlantic City, but residents would have little say in rates or improvements. Currently, a local board supervises Atlantic City\u2019s water utility. If a private company took over, only the state\u2019s public utility board, which has limited power, could intercede to mitigate hefty rate hikes.</p> <p>In September, Atlantic City violated a key term of New Jersey\u2019s $73m loan by failing to dissolve its municipal utility authority, and this month it sailed past the most recent state-imposed deadlines. New Jersey\u2019s division of community affairs, which administers the loan, refused to comment.</p> <p>While it remains unclear when and if the state might enforce the terms of the loan agreement, a <a href=\"http://www.njspotlight.com/stories/15/02/05/with-stroke-of-pen-christie-makes-it-easy-sell-off-water-wastewater-facilities/\">2014 law signed by Christie</a> assured an easy transfer of Atlantic City\u2019s water into private hands, and the governor has made his intentions clear. </p> <p>\u201cI want it secured by every asset they have, so that if they don\u2019t pay it, I get to take the assets, sell them and pay you [the taxpayer] back,\u201d Christie said at a public appearance in August, according to the <a href=\"http://www.pressofatlanticcity.com/news/breaking/atlantic-city-begins-dissolving-water-utility-for-million-loan/article_9bdfa650-55fa-11e6-8c6f-ab79300c9957.html\">Press of Atlantic City</a>.</p> <p>\u201cThey sent [the loan agreement] back all marked up, \u2018We want to change this, we want to change this,\u2019\u201d he said of Atlantic City lawmakers. \u201cExcuse me? You\u2019re asking for $74m to stay alive, you should just say, \u2018Where do I sign? Thank you, sir.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Over the past few years, Christie has laid the groundwork for the lease or sale of New Jersey water utilities. The <a href=\"http://www.njspotlight.com/stories/15/02/05/with-stroke-of-pen-christie-makes-it-easy-sell-off-water-wastewater-facilities/\">2014 Water Infrastructure Protection Act</a> eliminated the requirement for a <a href=\"http://www.nj.gov/dep/wipa/general.html\">public referendum</a> when water infrastructure is sold or leased to a private company in \u201c<a href=\"http://www.nj.gov/dep/wipa/general.html\">emergent conditions</a>\u201d. The law also eliminated the public utility board\u2019s review of rate hikes from water system purchases, an expert at the rate counsel of New Jersey said.</p> <p>In other words, if Atlantic City\u2019s water supply is purchased for $100m, a price <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2016/01/30/464961028/new-jersey-steps-in-to-turn-around-atlantic-city-s-luck\">repeatedly cited in public debate</a>, corporate buyers could lawfully pass on that cost to ratepayers in increased water rates \u2013 not just in Atlantic City, but anywhere across the state that the corporation owns water.</p> <p>\u201cThe bill suggests that costs get automatically passed to ratepayers,\u201d said Stefanie Brand, the director of the rate counsel of New Jersey, about the Water Infrastructure Protection Act, which passed into law. Though she said her organization would fight such an increase, she admitted it was \u201cunclear\u201d whether the rate counsel could triumph. </p> <p>At least two of the largest private water companies in America have lobbied heavily in New Jersey: Suez North America, a French multinational corporation, and American Water.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6a5ca7de1fc127e64282a00a20777bb55dbfb00f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6a5ca7de1fc127e64282a00a20777bb55dbfb00f/0_308_4946_2974/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Chris Christie has laid the groundwork for the lease or sale of New Jersey water utilities.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"601\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chris Christie has laid the groundwork for the lease or sale of New Jersey water utilities.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mel Evans/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>New Jersey American Water, a subsidiary of American Water, spent $708,750 from 2011 to 2015 lobbying New Jersey lawmakers on \u201cutility business issues\u201d, according to state lobbying disclosures.

  "<p><em>Our new series,<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/series/the-divorce-survival-guide\"> the divorce survival guide</a>, hosts writers discussing the most bitter cut of all: the end of a marriage</em></p> <p>Last November, my husband sat me down on the living room floor and told me he didn\u2019t see a future for us. The abrupt end of my 18-year relationship left me feeling blindsided and disoriented, and my brain parsed the event as a trauma. I was in a surreal fight-or-flight mode for months, unable to sleep or eat normally, disoriented to the degree that I would walk into walls as I tried to cook for my son, or fall down the stairs for no reason.<br></p> <p>On top of this personal shock, I also had to face my readers. In my work as a publisher of an online wedding magazine, I spent the winter of my divorce figuring out co-parenting while also co-producing wedding expos nationwide. I juggled meetings with child therapists and wedding vendors. It was rough.</p> <p>But as I round out the first year since my divorce, things have calmed down. I look back and wish I could wrap my arms around that poor blindsided woman a year ago and whisper these truths into her ear.</p> <h2>1. Trip out on grief \u2013 it\u2019s a hallucinogen</h2> <p>Regardless of how your marriage ends, it\u2019s a death. Maybe it\u2019s a loving euthanasia that you both agree on, maybe it\u2019s a violent one-sided decision that only one of you sees coming, but it\u2019s a death regardless. This means both of you will go through grief \u2013 a powerful mind-altering substance.</p> <p>In the darkest of my days, I felt like I was on a low dose of LSD at all times \u2013 time was weird, my vision was odd, I threw up for no reason, my emotions were out of control. Even eating was an intellectual exercise (chew, chew \u2026 swallow? Is that what you do next?). I generally felt like I was tripping. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I felt like I was on a low\u200b-\u200b dose of LSD \u2013 time was weird, my vision was odd, my emotions were out of control</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>This state of mind was profoundly uncomfortable, but also weirdly educational. Never a big crier, I received a crash course in what tear-induced catharsis felt like \u2013 and holy wow, it felt <em>good</em>. Like many mind-altering substances, there are lessons there if you want to learn them.</p> <h2>2. Choose healing</h2> <p>In the first weeks of the separation, I desperately tried to hold the space for two parallel realities: on the one hand, I wanted to hold out hope for the salvage of my marriage. On the other, I recognized that I was traumatized and broken \u2013 and that I needed to heal.</p> <p>A month in, I had a panic attack that made it clear to me that it was beyond my capacity to hold both \u201chealing\u201d and \u201chope\u201d. So abandon hope all ye who enter here. Choose healing, instead. </p> <h2>3. Shift attention away from your former partner</h2> <p>Regardless of how your separation goes down, it\u2019s a waste to expand energy on your ex. This will feel deeply frustrating. You will want to argue over details, assign blame, and defend your actions ... but here\u2019s the cold hard truth: it really doesn\u2019t matter any more. </p> <p>The longer you keep trying to define yourself in relation to your former partner\u2019s actions or opinions, the longer you keep yourself trapped in the relationship. You don\u2019t want to find yourself \u201cdivorced to someone\u201d instead of \u201cdivorced from someone\u201d. Resist the urge to rage at your ex or complain about them to other people. </p> <p>For me, time invested in thinking or talking about my former partner was time away from building my and my son\u2019s new life together. I tried to see my ex as a new person with only one role: a co-parent.</p> <p>Think of it like martial arts: avoid flailing. Conserve your energy. You\u2019ll need it.</p> <h2>4. Grab reinvention by the balls</h2> <p>This may be the best opportunity you\u2019ve had in years (or even decades) to re-assess where you\u2019re at, who you are, and who you want to be. </p> <p>My divorce meant a very abrupt disintegration of domestic systems I\u2019d had in place for years \u2013 childcare, chores, scheduling, finances. Once I\u2019d gotten over the shock, I realized I had an amazing opportunity to rebuild them on my own terms. Once the domestic systems were reestablished so my son had a stable home, I shifted my attention to my own internal systems: food, exercise, sleep. </p> <p>My divorce came with a 50/50 custody split, which meant that suddenly I also had a lot of time on my hands. At first it felt oppressive: I grieved losing so much time with my son, and sat alone in my empty house, hours stretching ahead of me into days. Even my self-employment (which gave me the privilege of a stable income and a flexible schedule) started to make me feel adrift in a structureless, empty life.</p> <p>Then I started to think of rebuilding that empty life as an epic project. Which brings us to ...</p> <h2>5. Try all the things</h2> <p>In part to deal with my own loneliness and anxiety, I started filling my lonely childless days with trying things to see if they\u2019d help me heal. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>You don\u2019t want find yourself 'divorced to someone' instead of 'divorced from someone'</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I tried boxing and firing ranges, sound healing and reiki. I tried jumping jacks to see if they\u2019d help with panic, sprinting to see if it helped with the fear, making an altar to see if it would help with the existential angst. I tried <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flooding_(psychology)\">flooding </a>and doing behavior training on myself, intentionally exposing myself to places and situation that deeply upset me to see if I could burn out my emotional receptors. </p> <p>I tried sleeping pills from my doctor (who diagnosed me with \u201cacute adjustment disorder\u201d) and <a href=\"https://www.leafly.com/explore/category-indica\">indica strains</a> from the local legal pot shop (who didn\u2019t care about a diagnosis). I tried three months of sobriety. I tried floor-length sequin gowns and burlesque instruction from a new age stripper who\u2019s a classically trained ballerina. I tried pull-ups and protein. I tried crying until capillaries broke in my eyelids. I tried grief retreats and keening. I tried weird witchy intention-setting and crystals, and then straight-forward systematic mental exercises and meditation practices. </p> <p>Some things worked better than others, but I learned a lot. </p> <h2>6. Talk to all the people</h2> <p>When you\u2019re partnered, you focus most of your energy on that one person. Out of my partnership, I had an insatiable hunger for new brains. This started with focusing more energy on my closest bonds: I got closer with my parents than I\u2019d been since high school. Then it radiated out to my friends: they held my hands while I lay in bed sobbing, and a year later I\u2019m the one holding hands as they go through their own divorces and illnesses and traumas. There is no longer time for small talk. </p> <p>From there, I radiated out to strangers: I started complimenting randos on the street, just because I needed to see someone smile. </p> <p>Then I started inhaling people\u2019s stories: the queer former-cheerleader, the opera singer, the tree climber, the corset-maker, the pin-up model with PTSD, my mountaineering accountant going through her own divorce, on and on and on. As I made more friends, I absorbed all their tales and my circle of beloveds got both wider and deeper. My sense of place in the world broadened. </p> <h2>7. Know that it gets better (even if you absolutely don\u2019t believe it)</h2> <p>One of the hardest parts of my post-divorce depression was dealing with the feeling that the pain was going to last forever. The hopelessness! The darkness! It engulfed everything: you feel bad, and you will feel bad forever. Your brain simply cannot fathom that it is not the case. </p> <p>You can\u2019t convince yourself of this in the moment, but just let the reality float out there until you eventually feel it: it gets better. Even if all you can do some days is tread water with one nostril above the water, know that there is a shore out there somewhere.</p> <p>You won\u2019t find it; it\u2019ll find its way to you.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Hi Ken, how are you? </strong>I\u2019m good, Small Talk, how are you?</p> <p><strong>We\u2019re fine, thanks. You\u2019re playing Judd Trump in the English Open, which starts next week.

Barry Hearn, World Snooker and the WPBSA have done a tremendous job over the last few years. The game was on its knees five or six years ago but they\u2019ve taken it to a new level. We had 300 million people watching this year\u2019s World Championship in Asia alone, which is incredible. Hopefully tournaments like the English Open will grow and grow.</p> <p><strong>Barry Hearn could make tiddlywinks a box-office sport. What\u2019s his secret? </strong>He\u2019s got the Midas touch. He\u2019s a very good businessman and he tries to push the boat out. Also, he has an infectious personality and character \u2013 I think business people are attracted to that. He\u2019s very well liked within the game.</p> <p><strong>How\u2019s your game at the moment? </strong>(Laughs) My game is crap! I still love the game and I like competing but I\u2019m not playing the way I was. I\u2019m 47 so I don\u2019t expect to be playing like I was at 27 when I won the world championship.</p> <p><strong>In snooker terms, what\u2019s the hardest part about ageing? </strong>I\u2019d say it\u2019s confidence. You become more conscious of certain things that you wouldn\u2019t have thought about before. When you\u2019re younger you just get down and play the shot. Other things come into your life as well, family in particular. That\u2019s just a fact of life. But apart from my family there\u2019s nothing I love more than playing snooker. I still have a great passion for it and I still love being involved in it and that\u2019s why I do the BBC tournaments; I love the craic with the other players and the BBC crew. I still think I can cause a bit of an upset before I hang up my cue; that\u2019s what I\u2019m hoping for.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e191a95d07df58f76e7b873375a8e034966627b9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e191a95d07df58f76e7b873375a8e034966627b9/0_31_1728_1037/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ken Doherty\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ken Doherty in action at the 2001 World Championship.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gareth Copley/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>What\u2019s your most vivid memory of beating Stephen Hendry to become world champion? </strong>When I potted the brown in the final frame. I was on the blue, 11 points ahead, and that was the first time that I realised I was gonna win. I\u2019d been dreaming about winning that World Championship from the time I was eight years old, and all the way through that championship I could see myself lifting up the cup, but I never fully believed it until I potted the brown.</p> <p>When I potted the blue there was a big cheer and I was like a Cheshire cat. I couldn\u2019t wait to get around and pot the pink. It made it even better that my friends from Ireland were in the crowd. None of my family were there. They were too nervous; they couldn\u2019t even watch it. My mother went on the missing list! Nobody knew where she was. It turned out she was roaming the streets of Dublin, going in all the churches and lighting candles for me!</p> <p><strong>Do you watch the final back very often? </strong>No I don\u2019t actually. I don\u2019t have a DVD of it. Sometimes my son might put it on YouTube. I do love watching it \u2013 it still sends the shivers down my spine, because it was a once-in-a-lifetime thing. So many players don\u2019t get the chance of experiencing those emotions, so I feel lucky. I\u2019m disappointed I didn\u2019t win it again because I\u2019ve been in two other finals, but my name is on the trophy and nobody can take that away. It means you\u2019re etched into the annals of snooker history.</p> <p>I can\u2019t believe it\u2019s 20 years! It\u2019s gone so quick. I was 27 then. I look at some of the pictures and, ah gee, I look like a baby. I thought I knew it all. I thought I knew all about the world and life, and I was so stupid and so na\u00efve! But they were great times.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Evz167TOZ34\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Evz167TOZ34?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p><strong>Marcus Rashford wasn\u2019t even born when you became world champion. </strong>That really makes me feel good!</p> <p><strong>How tired were you after your run to the final in 2003? </strong>I think that was the most disappointed I\u2019ve ever been \u2013 that and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adV39JXbcXg\">missing the black for the 147 at Wembley</a>. After all the last-frame deciders and comebacks, to have won the world title that year would have been something. I think I played 132 frames out of a possible 137, it was quite incredible.</p> <p><strong>Did you sleep for days when it was over? </strong>Ah, I was so devastated. I don\u2019t think I ever really got over it. But it was a great tournament and a great final, and it would have been really special winning it.</p> <p><strong>It would have arguably been the greatest-ever world championship win \u2026 </strong>I think it could have been. I had a 10-9 in the first round, 13-12 in the second, 13-9 against John Higgins \u2013 I\u2019d been 10-0 up \u2013 and the semi-final against Paul Hunter which a lot of people still remember, when I was 15-9 down and won 17-16. Even in the final, being 10-2 down, to come back to 12-12 and lose 18-16, that was quite tough. As they say: would, should, could, no good!</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uteOgAAUp0I\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/uteOgAAUp0I?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p><strong>With all those comebacks, did you start to feel invincible? </strong>At the World Championship it helps that you have so many frames to claw your way back. I had an inner belief then \u2013 I wish I had it now! \u2013 that even if a fella went four or five frames ahead of me, I didn\u2019t panic. I knew I had the guts and determination, and the game, to claw it back. There\u2019s nothing worse than somebody coming back at you when you\u2019re quite a few ahead. You get enveloped in a state of nervousness and panic more than anything, because you think, \u2018Jesus if I lose this I\u2019ll never hear the end of it.\u2019</p> <p> <strong>Did anything about being world champion surprise you? </strong>I don\u2019t know if anything surprised me but there was one funny story afterwards. I met the chief superintendent at Mansion House, the Lord Mayor\u2019s residence, for a reception, and he said to me, \u201cYou know something, Mr Doherty, from the hours of 7-10pm, during the final session of the World Championship, there wasn\u2019t one call into the central police station in Dublin.\u201d They thought there was something wrong with the phones! They rang up to ask if there was a problem, and the girl on the other end said, \u201cAre you not watching the snooker?\u201d Even the criminals were watching it!</p> <p><strong>Tell us a bit about your radio show </strong>I co-host it with Reggie Corrigan, who played over 40 times as a prop-forward for Ireland, and it\u2019s live every Saturday on Sunshine Radio from 9am to 11am, and we just talk about sport. It\u2019s a bit like TalkSport. It\u2019s very light-hearted, a couple of guys talking as if they were in the pub with their mates. We have guests from other sports, depending on what\u2019s topical. I absolutely love it, it\u2019s a great passion of ours. We have great craic. If I get stopped on the street these days it\u2019s because of the radio show, not because of the snooker!</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f0cb05a5503d778735f001d8808266a202ff490a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f0cb05a5503d778735f001d8808266a202ff490a/0_698_3188_3987/800.jpg\" alt=\"Ken Doherty\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ken Doherty parades his trophy at Old Trafford in May 1997.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Leech/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>What\u2019s this about you becoming a Barnsley fan? </strong>I went to Barnsley just to watch them play because I love football, and now everyone thinks I\u2019m a Barnsley fan! But no, I love Man United. That was one of the proudest moments of being world champion, parading the cup around Old Trafford. Sir Alex Ferguson and Martin Edwards were fantastic to me that day. They looked after me, showed me round and introduced me to the players. I met Eric Cantona. It was quite funny, because Sir Alex Ferguson bought me into meet the players, who were all sitting having their lunch. I walked into the canteen, and he introduced me, and everybody just looked around. The whole room went quiet and I was standing there like a lemon with the cup; I didn\u2019t know what to do. There was silence for about 30 seconds, and it felt like an hour. Then this fella gets up off his chair and walks straight over and says <em>[Puts on French accent]</em> \u201cCongratulations Mr Doherty\u201d. I was shaking, I was looking up because he was so much taller than me and all I could say was, \u201cThank you Mr Cantona.\u201d I shit myself! He was such a hero, and he was such a huge man. I didn\u2019t know what he going to say to me. He had a lot of class. It was a nice touch that he was the first up, and once he came up everyone followed suit. What I didn\u2019t know is that he\u2019d decided to retire and that would be his last game for United.</p> <p><strong>What\u2019s the best sports book you\u2019ve read? </strong>There are three that stand out: Only A Game by Eamon Dunphy, Open by Andre Agassi and Thomas Hauser\u2019s book on Muhammad Ali.</p> <p><strong>What was the last film you saw? </strong>You\u2019ll probably laugh at this \u2013 it was Pete\u2019s Dragon. It was a lovely movie. I took my son, who\u2019s eight years old, and my nephew and niece. I took them as a treat for my nephew as it was his birthday. We had a great time. I was welling up and they were sitting there with their popcorn and their jellies, looking at me going, \u201cAre you <em>crying?\u201d</em> I said, \u201cNah, not at all, I\u2019ve just got something in my eye!\u201d I\u2019m one of these who weeps at touching things, it\u2019s really weird. I shouldn\u2019t really be telling you that. I\u2019ll ruin my reputation!</p> <p><strong>What\u2019s your favourite TV show? </strong>My favourite of all time would be The Sopranos. I\u2019m watching Narcos at the moment but I don\u2019t watch soaps or anything like that.</p> <p><strong>What did you think of the ending? </strong>That was fantastic. It wasn\u2019t the ending I was expecting, but I wouldn\u2019t have liked to see him get shot anyway. It left it open which was quite clever. I was just sad it finished because it was one of the funniest and most brutal dramas you could ever wish to see. The language and the interaction between the characters was fantastic. I love films like that as well \u2013 Goodfellas, Casino, The Godfather.</p> <p><strong>It\u2019s easy to forget just how funny it was. </strong>It\u2019s amazingly funny. The banter between them, and all the conniving. They have a drink and take the piss out of each other and then they\u2019re stabbing each other in the back! It\u2019s frightening, it was so funny in a dark way.</p> <p><strong>What\u2019s your favourite album? </strong>It would have to be The Joshua Tree. My type of music is U2, Coldplay, Rolling Stones, Oasis, that type of thing.</p> <p><strong>Who\u2019s the most famous person in your phone? </strong>Who\u2019s the most famous person in my phone? Probably Brendan O\u2019Carroll from Mrs Brown\u2019s Boys. He\u2019s from Dublin and we share the same birthday, though not the same age! I did have a call from someone famous during the 2003 World Championship final though. I don\u2019t know how he got my number. I went back to the hotel and was getting ready for the final session. It was 12-12 and I thought I\u2019d check my phone as there were always good-luck messages. One of the messages went like this: \u201cHey maaaaan, I\u2019m sitting here with Guggi and Simon Carmody. We\u2019re watching the snooker, you\u2019ve made a great comeback so far, keep it going man, we\u2019re all proud of you over here.

When I first came over to England, before I was even professional. we used to stay in a B&amp;B in Essex. I was 18 or so. The landlord and landlady were Irish, and it was great \u2013 it was \u00a350 a week, staying in Chadwell Heath in Essex. It was 10 minutes from the Snooker Club where I used to practice every day. You got your bed, breakfast and evening meal, and sometimes she did your washing as well if she was in a good mood! It was happy days, you couldn\u2019t get better. But unbeknown to us, the husband had an alcohol problem and some mental-health issues. One night I was tucked up in bed, dreaming of becoming the world champion, and the husband and wife were in the room next to me. My friend, who shared a twin room with me, used to work late and get home around 1am. He came in the door, and before he went upstairs he smelt something funny. He went into the kitchen and the guy had the gas oven on full blast and three of the hob rings on, not lighting, with just one ring lit up. He was ready to blow the whole place up, and me with it. So my snooker career could have ended before it even began. I always credit my friend with saving my life.</p> <p><strong>Had the bloke fallen asleep? </strong>No, he did it deliberately. We packed our bags and left. We\u2019d thought the \u00a350 deal was too good to be true. We told the woman about it when he wasn\u2019t there.

  "<p> \u201cHello?\u201d Skype blinks across the Atlantic to reveal Greg Jackson in his Brooklyn apartment on a boiling afternoon. One of his characters may use the video chat app to keep in touch with her \u201cdysphoric\u201d dogs, but the debut author confesses he\u2019s unused to such communication himself. And though he\u2019s warm and forthcoming, with the air of a slightly worried Buddha, he does seem a little cautious.</p> <p>This is unsurprising for a number of reasons \u2013 he\u2019s new to media scrutiny, he describes himself (and the other writers he knows) as a \u201cstay-at-home introvert\u201d, and Skype is a peculiar way to talk. But caution, qualification and a keenness to include nuance seem to be part of his style as a person. And they are also characteristic of his striking debut short-story collection, <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/prodigals.html\">Prodigals</a>, for which the US National Book Foundation last week <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/sep/30/national-book-foundation-picks-five-under-35-new-writers-to-watch\">named him as one of five writers under 35</a> expected \u201cto make a lasting impression on the literary landsape\u201d.</p> <p> Wagner in the Desert begins the collection with one of what must be one of the best, and most subtle lists in recent fiction.

Later, we did blow off the keys to ecologically responsible cars.\u201d This voluptuous inventory of sensual pleasures continues through a delicatessen of narcotics, past swaps of prescription drugs, and on to high-end gastronomy washed down with the finest wines and spirits. \u201cWe spent our hot December afternoons next to the custom saltwater pool or below the parasols of palm fronds, waiting, I suppose, to feel at peace, to baptise our minds in an enforced nullity, to return to a place from which we could begin again.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jun/01/top-10-books-to-make-you-a-better-person-wg-sebald-roberto-bolano\">Greg Jackson's top 10 books to make you a better person</a> </p> </aside>  <p> These languid hedonists, like most of Jackson\u2019s characters, have plenty of money, and he\u2019s always alert to their vanity and self-indulgence.

His characters are all, within their ordinary limitations, trying to live a good, socially responsible and \u201csustainable\u201d life.</p> <p> \u201cAt least in the US press,\u201d he says, \u201cthe response I\u2019ve had has indicated the book is about either the upper middle class or about drugs. But actually, if I were to have to pick one theme, it\u2019s seeking. I don\u2019t necessarily mean anything religious, although it could be. I mean the sense that there is a side of life that we can\u2019t just reduce to transactional or practical frameworks. It feels like this is a big part of our feeling alone.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Despite the extreme social divisions in the US, Jackson is unapologetic about treating the rich with sympathy</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p> Other stories in the collection address characters in much tighter circumstances, but despite the extreme social divisions in the US, Jackson is unapologetic about treating the rich with sympathy: \u201cI think money, class background is hugely important in the US. What people objected to, especially when every other book has a cover illustration of a view over Central Park and depicts the follies of the rich, is that I wanted to take the problems of these people seriously. Not because I think we need to be especially sympathetic to <em>them</em>, but because we need to be sympathetic to everybody.\u201d</p> <p> Jackson\u2019s own search has taken him on the familiar route through a creative writing degree into teaching. It\u2019s now brought him, at 33, to Brooklyn, which he describes as \u201cone of the least interesting things I\u2019ve done\u201d, joking that his routine in this modern literary Mecca is to go jogging with Paul Auster every morning.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4b62c333cb6ab2cc4f615848cf98e69546a13948\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4b62c333cb6ab2cc4f615848cf98e69546a13948/343_552_4854_2913/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jogging \u2026 part of the routine in Brooklyn\u2019s literary Mecca.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jogging \u2026 part of the routine in Brooklyn\u2019s literary Mecca.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Oli Kellett/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p> He\u2019s arrived at a literary voice that combines attention to modern minutiae (which he confesses owes something to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/feb/26/infinite-jest-david-foster-wallace-20th-anniversary-20-things-need-know\">David Foster Wallace</a>) with an earlier generation\u2019s attention to intense psychological realism. He\u2019s reluctant to cite influences, lest people imagine he \u201cvery conceitedly\u201d thinks he writes like them. But after gentle prodding a long list rolls out, revealing an early taste for \u201cmaximalist\u201d modernists such as Conrad, before moving on to the likes of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/roberto-bolano\">Roberto Bola\u00f1o</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2007/aug/24/guardianobituaries.booksobituaries\">Grace Paley</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/donald-barthelme\">Donald Barthelme</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2013/may/13/wg-sebald-legacy\">WG Sebald</a>. If his stories are concerned to get purchase on true life, they are also very much aware of the different literary strategies of approaching it.</p> <p> It\u2019s a style that is supersensitive to the contingency and contradiction of individual character. In one story, a woman considers her former husband: \u201cIt did take a certain ballsiness, what he had done, in the middle of their divorce no less, and she could see, in fact she couldn\u2019t not see, that the flipside of this prickishness was the quality she loved in Zeke, loved best in him perhaps, when she did love him \u2013 she still did \u2013 she just hated him now too.\u201d</p> <p> In another story, a man drives south from New York with a woman whom he once almost loved. As they head towards their respective families, a dangerous storm gathering over the highway, the car crackles with the ambivalence they feel towards each other and their apparently settled lives. As mutual attraction flickers, the narrator is reminded of the girl he once knew, \u201c<em>that</em> Susan, excitable and unformed, spilling slightly beyond herself as people when they are at their most beautiful do\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"39b28ee8bfe0406aee30526308bb08ca93d6342f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/39b28ee8bfe0406aee30526308bb08ca93d6342f/0_361_5472_3283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gathering storm \u2026 in his story, the car crackles with feeling.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gathering storm \u2026 in his story, the car crackles with feeling.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ryan McGinnis/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Any easy shorthand to reduce someone into a book character \u2026 does not reflect their full human dignity</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p> Such meticulously uncertain characters seem very close to the emotional heart of his fiction. \u201cThey could all be lots of other people, and they contain other people within themselves. Any sort of easy shorthand that\u2019s going to reduce someone into a character in a book is a reduction that does not reflect their full human dignity.\u201d He frowns reflectively, and adds that although he admires heroes of modernism such as Proust \u201cwho seemed to think if we can capture every single switchback of thought that we can encapsulate full human consciousness\u201d, a writer will never reach humans\u2019 authentic complexity. Jackson hopes instead to \u201cleave some of the mystery and lacunae there, and let us imagine our way in\u201d.</p> <p> Although he enjoys the way a short story can \u201cmore or less invent its own form\u201d, the expansive ambition of his fiction and the commercial challenges of short stories mean he finds himself \u201cunder enormous pressure to produce a novel\u201d.</p> <p> \u201cI love novels,\u201d he adds, \u201cbut it\u2019s such a slog to write one.

A good few carefully modulated sentences stretch out euphoniously over half a page or more. There\u2019s something of this tendency in the way he speaks as well, though Jackson says he wishes his answers could be a bit more compressed. Concision in mind, I offer him a wilfully dumb question to pat back, tweet-style: So, Greg, what\u2019s your book about?</p> <p> He winces, and pauses for a long time, then seems to pause again. \u201cSpiritual longing,\u201d he offers eventually. He winces again, then laughs.</p>",
  "<p>A court in Ontario has agreed to quash $65,000 Canadian dollars (\u00a338,500) worth of tickets racked up during one man\u2019s nine-year stint living on the streets, in a case that has sparked debate on the effectiveness of legislation that criminalises <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/homelessness\">homelessness</a>.</p> <p>Gerry Williams spent years trapped in a cycle of alcoholism and homelessness. Encounters with the police often left him with a battery of tickets for non-criminal offences, from drinking in public to loitering. At the time, he paid little attention. </p> <p>But later, when he was sober and off the streets, the tickets \u2013 450 of them \u2013 came back to haunt him. As he fought to make a clean break with his past, hoping to find work in the restaurant industry or helping others struggling with addiction and homelessness, collection agencies began to hound him for the thousands of dollars he owed. </p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve been stuck in limbo,\u201d said a softly spoken Williams, who has been off the streets for more than two years. \u201cThey were holding me back from obtaining my Ontario driver\u2019s licence and they were also holding me back on my credit rating, which I want to start building up for future loans.\u201d </p> <p>Last year, the 45-year-old enlisted the help of Fair Change, <a href=\"http://www.fairchange.ca/\">a legal clinic run by law students</a> in Toronto. \u201cWhen he came in with this stack of paperwork, my eyes widened as I realised just how big his appeal was going to be,\u201d said Daniel Ciarabellini, a third-year law student at Toronto\u2019s York University and a director at Fair Change. </p> <p>The number of tickets would add up to more than 100 hours of work, said Ciarabellini. Twelve volunteers were brought in to help the clinic\u2019s handful of students tackle the case. \u201cIt took us months to finish this paperwork, even with everybody doing a slice of it,\u201d he said. </p> <p>In her decision this week, Justice Katrina Mulligan waived most of the tickets. One charge remains, with Williams sentenced to 156 hours of community service for aggressive begging. Williams owes a further C$5,000 in tickets for federal offences, which must be appealed against separately. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c7150b8f69dd5ea3ad981ba26d19d0eaddee65ce\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c7150b8f69dd5ea3ad981ba26d19d0eaddee65ce/0_0_5184_3110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Law student Daniel Ciarabellini, left, is thanked by his client Gerry Williams outside Old City Hall court after having about C$65,000 in fines reduced to zero.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Law student Daniel Ciarabellini, left, is thanked by his client Gerry Williams outside Old City Hall court after having about C$65,000 in fines reduced to zero.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris So/Toronto Sta/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The decision, resulting from a deal struck between the crown and defence, came as a relief to Williams. He said: \u201cI thought \u2018finally\u2019. I was happy the courts acknowledged these matters.\u201d </p> <p>In most cases Fair Change has seen like this, the outcome is similar, said Ciarabellini. Often his group is able to get the amount owing to within 10-15%. \u201cIt is very much a formality,\u201d he said of the court process.</p> <p>Apart from the amount he owed, there was little that made Williams\u2019 case exceptional, said Ciarabellini. \u201cPretty much every homeless person that you pass by in Toronto owes money to the city,\u201d he said, citing several people he had met who owed up to C$20,000. </p> <p>He described it as an invisible problem stemming from the various laws that seek to criminalise homelessness. \u201cWhen you live on the street you are constantly receiving tickets, five to 10 a day,\u201d he said. \u201cYou develop this cycle of just always being out in public space, because you don\u2019t have anywhere else to go.\u201d </p> <p>Williams\u2019 case has prompted <a href=\"http://torontoist.com/2016/10/homelessness-fines/\">calls by some to revisit legislation</a> around panhandling and homelessness. A study by Toronto\u2019s York University in 2014 looked at legislation introduced by the province in 1999 to deter panhandling and estimated it had cost nearly C$1m in police time to hand out at least C$4m of tickets over an 11-year period. About 99% of the tickets went unpaid, the study found. </p> <p>A petition, <a href=\"https://www.change.org/p/the-legislative-assembly-of-ontario-repeal-the-safe-streets-act?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=notification&amp;utm_campaign=new_petition_recruit#share\">launched on Wednesday and backed by a coalition of organisations</a> and individuals, calls on Ontario to repeal its legislation targeting panhandlers. </p> <p>These laws often trap people who are homeless, severely disadvantaged and who struggle with mental illness and addiction, said Ciarabellini, along with being costly and ineffective. </p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe anyone in the process believes at any point that all these tickets are going to get paid,\u201d he said. \u201cYou impose a monetary penalty on people who have no money \u2013 it doesn\u2019t take a genius to predict what\u2019s going to happen.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Many students have no trouble adapting to their new university\u2019s culture. They don togas in freshers\u2019 week, assemble their ultimate squad by the end of year one, and make the most of the next few years until a cushy grad scheme picks them up at the end of it. </p> <p>Others, however, will spend their first term fantasising about how great life would be anywhere other than the lonely fourth floor of their halls.</p> <p>In the past, unhappy students pretty much had to find a way to like it or lump it. But now the government is in the process of making it <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/jul/26/flexible-terms-students-swap-university-bill\">easier to switch university</a>. The aim is to increase competition and encourage social mobility. Although the number of student making the change is currently low \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/jul/26/flexible-terms-students-swap-university-bill\">fewer than 7,000 students switched institution in 2013-14, out of about 400,000 UK undergraduates</a> \u2013 it\u2019s likely to increase. So if you\u2019re feeling like you just want out, here\u2019s what you might want to consider first:</p> <h2>Is it you or is it the uni?</h2> <p>Some people have their heart set on going to a certain place. They love the city, they\u2019ve planned their internships and they know exactly how they\u2019re going to spend their weekends. But if you didn\u2019t get into your first-choice university, and you end up, reluctantly, at an unfamiliar campus in a faraway town, then life can feel unfair. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/sep/21/want-to-make-a-difference-at-university-join-the-clubs\">Want to make a difference at university? Join the clubs</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cI had a fine time \u2013 met two of my closest friends \u2013 but my heart was never in it,\u201d says Charlotte Jones, who switched from Southampton to Queen Mary\u2019s in London at the end of her first year. \u201cNot getting into my first-choice universities was really difficult \u2013 it was my first real taste of disappointment, and I hadn\u2019t expected it. I think, in a way, it was immaturity that led me back to London. Southampton wasn\u2019t my first choice of uni and I couldn\u2019t accept the change of plans, or adapt to them.\u201d </p> <h2>Change can be expensive</h2> <p>It\u2019s important to be aware that there are financial implications to switching university. Manuel Souto-Otero, a senior lecturer in social sciences at Cardiff University who prepared a report in 2013 for the Higher Education Academy on credit transfer, says moving university can ending up costing you. \u201cPeople may have established connections \u2013 found a flat, got a job \u2013 and these are additional costs. You will need to check with the student loans company and this is something you might have to take into account when making your decision.\u201d</p> <p>Kirsty Bradbury, who moved from Bournemouth University to Southampton Solent at the end of her first year partly because of poor health, has experience of this. Although pleased she made the move, she says sorting her student finances was stressful and complicated. \u201cI was originally given less funding because the course was deemed to be shorter, but I kept getting told different things by advisers,\u201d she says. \u201cThere need to be much clearer guidelines when it comes to changing courses.\u201d</p> <h2>Leaving can be awkward</h2> <p>Sod\u2019s law dictates you will suddenly start to have a brilliant time once you\u2019ve decided to leave your university. And then there\u2019s the decision of how exactly you tell your new friends. Do you backdoor it? Do you have one last big night out? </p> <p>Jones says the process can be uncomfortable. \u201cIt was an awkward situation where I\u2019d umm\u2019d and ah\u2019d about leaving, and on a whim signed a contract for a second-year house with seven friends, so I had to pull out at the last minute and spend ages trying to find someone to fill my room,\u201d she says. \u201cMy friends in Southampton were all pissed off with me and didn\u2019t understand why I wanted to move. It was like an attack on them. They thought that I thought I was better than them.\u201d </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/sep/13/george-the-poets-message-to-freshers\">George the Poet's message to freshers</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>Try not to leave it late</h2> <p>Making a snap decision is scary but wasting a year thinking \u201cwhat if\u201d is no good either. According to Souto-Otero, it\u2019s easier if people change very early on. </p> <p>\u201cIt can be done through Ucas if it\u2019s in the first days, but if it goes beyond that, it gets a little bit more difficult. You have to contact the new uni directly to see if they have a place available,\u201d he says. \u201cIt can be easier to change courses within your uni, rather than moving away.\u201d</p> <h2>You could trade up \u2013 or down</h2> <p>The idea that you can transfer to a more reputable university is something the government mentioned in the white paper, in order to help under-represented groups who are more likely to have landed up at a uni for which they are over-qualified. </p> <p>Emran Mian, director of the Social Market Foundation and a former director of strategy at the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, expects switching between universities to become more common among those who do exceptionally well in first year. </p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s most likely to be young people who perhaps didn\u2019t get into their university of first choice right away, perhaps because their exam results weren\u2019t quite strong enough, or they didn\u2019t feel confident about doing well in a more competitive university. Perhaps their aspirations have risen, or career choices clarified, during their first year. This group of students will be looking to trade up.\u201d</p> <p>Then there are those who are struggling, and might want to move in the opposite direction \u2013 away from a selective university or a very demanding course. \u201cSwitching courses, for this group, is a better alternative than dropping out of higher education entirely,\u201d says Mian.</p> <h2>Consider staying local</h2> <p>If you don\u2019t want to uproot your life entirely then it\u2019s worth considering changing where you study but not where you live. Mian thinks that at the end of first year students are often settled. \u201cThey have established friendships, perhaps got a job. Some might want to consider moving to a university in the same city or region rather than further afield,\u201d he says. </p> <p>Of course it is possible that leaving the area is exactly what you want - to reunite with schoolfriends, follow a partner to another university or just to make a fresh start.</p> <h2>Will your work translate?</h2> <p>The challenge in moving universities will be transferring credits for the courses you have already completed. However, if universities are actively recruiting switchers \u2013 either to increase their numbers or to improve the diversity of their student body \u2013 then it\u2019s likely they will make it easy for incoming students to bring credits with them. </p> <p>\u201cEither that, or they will ask them to take an additional course or two during second year to bring them up to the same base as existing students,\u201d says Mian. </p> <h2>Whatever you choose, you\u2019re not a failure</h2> <p>When you switch direction, you might feel judged by those who think you lack perseverance.</p> <p>\u201cUni is seen as something you see through, and if you deviate it is something that hasn\u2019t gone according to plan,\u201d says Souto-Otero. Don\u2019t let this hold you back. With the increase in tuition fees, the practice of switching courses is likely to become far more common, and there\u2019s more reason than ever to put yourself first and make a decision that is right for you.</p> <p>For Jones, changing the plan wasn\u2019t easy but ultimately it was the right choice. \u201cMy switch resulted in brilliant work experience and part-time jobs that were crucial for my career. And I made some really good friends \u2013 in the end. But all these things took a while to realise and at the time it was awful, and lonely.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Keep up with the latest on Guardian Students: follow us on Twitter at<a href=\"https://twitter.com/gdnstudents\">@GdnStudents</a> \u2013 and <a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/students/\">become a member</a> to receive exclusive benefits and our weekly newsletter.</strong></p>",
  "<p>When it comes to the diverse range of people championing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/poetry\" title=\"\">poetry</a> in the UK, we seemingly have a lot to celebrate this National Poetry Day.

Writing and mentoring schemes such as <a href=\"http://slam.poetrysociety.org.uk/\" title=\"\">SLAMbassadors UK</a>, <a href=\"https://www.barbican.org.uk/education/young-people/young-poets\" title=\"\">Barbican Young Poets</a> and the<a href=\"http://www.roundhouse.org.uk/whats-on/2014/roundhouse-poetry-collective/\" title=\"\"> Roundhouse Poetry Collective</a> (as well as the Roundhouse\u2019s annual poetry slam) have become almost a rite of passage for young poets, a way for them to take their first guided steps into the poetry scene. The accessibility of the internet and the way it has revolutionised not just how poetry is shared but also what \u201ccounts\u201d as poetry shouldn\u2019t be underestimated either, with YouTube now host to thousands upon thousands of spoken-word videos from across the globe.</p> <p>Unlike a lot of other creative artforms, poetry has managed to diversify itself from the inside \u2013 up to a point. While it might be obvious that the future of poetry is diverse, many people fail to recognise that the present is too. Over the past year, Private Eye magazine has published cutting remarks about various women of colour in poetry \u2013 attributing half-Chinese Sarah Howe\u2019s win of the acclaimed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jan/11/ts-eliot-prize-poet-sarah-howe-wins-with-amazing-debut\" title=\"\">TS Eliot prize</a> to her good looks, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2016/sep/30/forward-prize-backward-reading-who-grumbles-if-white-writers-win-awards\" title=\"\">implying a kind of nepotism</a> because British-Caribbean poet Malika Booker was head of the panel that chose two Caribbean women as Forward prize recipients. Despite the last three Forward prize winners being of Afro-Caribbean heritage, this idea that people of colour succeeding in poetry is not merely rare but suspect is both common and false.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/sep/09/finding-minority-writers-isnt-racial-nepotism-its-cure-bigotry\">Finding minority writers isn't 'racial nepotism'. It's the cure for bigotry | Anjali Enjeti</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The poetry world is also not immune to the racism and sexism that is in the literary scene as a whole. Despite women and people of colour dominating the open mics and poetry slams that keep the scene alive, it is noticeable that you see more men and white people booked for paying gigs and festivals, and more still actually being published \u2013 and I don\u2019t accept that white men are simply better writers. Saying that, they are rarely working class, with classism also a huge but often forgotten problem in poetry. The literary establishment needs to not just encourage and promote more writing from working-class writers, young and old, but also move past assumptions that working-class young boys, for example, won\u2019t want to write poems. The seemingly endless debates about what counts as \u201cproper\u201d poetry and what is \u201cmerely spoken word\u201d are fuelled by a need to define and control the artform, and do little more than alienate the people who enjoy poems under, or identify with, this label.</p> <p>In the closing lines of <a href=\"http://www.poetryarchive.org/poem/my-country\" title=\"\">Jackie Kay\u2019s In My Country</a>, the poet is defiant about where she comes from: \u201c\u2018Here. These parts.\u2019\u201d Writers from all backgrounds deserve the right to feel as strongly about their place in British poetry, regardless of where we may appear to come from. Diversity is not a dirty word, and ensuring that female, working-class and non-white poets are both writing and performing can only serve to make an already wealthy scene even richer.</p>",

  "<p>Like many journalists in Russia, Elena Milashina is reluctant to talk about her work. In 2006, her close friend and collaborator Anna Politkovskaya was assassinated in Moscow, shot four times in the entry hall to her block of flats.</p> <p>It was an event that shocked the journalism community and signalled that the climate of mistrust and the suspicion of a free press, encouraged by a Kremlin crackdown on independent media, was reaching a new peak. </p> <p>Politkovskaya had been reporting closely on the wars in Chechnya, where separatist groups had been fighting unsuccessfully for independence from Russia, since 1994. By 2006 the region was firmly under the control of its Russian-appointed leader, Ramzan Kadyrov, who was operating a large private militia accused of savage brutality. </p> <p>Though Politkovskaya had been warned by many friends and colleagues that she was in danger, she decided to keep returning. Thomas de Waal, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2006/oct/12/comment.chechnya\">writing at the time of her death</a>, described how she had fearlessly reported \u201con the bombings, torture camps, abductions and corruption in Moscow\u2019s second campaign in Chechnya.\u201d</p> <p>He added: \u201cIt felt at times that our news from Chechnya came from a remarkable one-woman reporting operation.\u201d</p> <p>After her death, many of her colleagues left the profession, fearing for their own safety. Others decided to stop reporting from the North Caucausus, where the bloody conflict was still raging. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I'm not interested in writing about flowers.

Milashina reported that the policeman, a close ally of Kadyrov, had threatened reprisals against the girl\u2019s family if she refused his proposal.</p> <p>The story prompted outrage when it appeared in Novaya Gazeta, with human rights activists calling for the Kremlin to step in and users of social media openly criticising Kadyrov\u2019s regime. However, the wedding went ahead, with the Chechen leader posting a picture of himself dancing at the party. Milashina was then warned that the Chechen police had \u201cshown an interest in her\u201d.</p> <p>This was not the first time she had attracted the ire of the authorities. In addition to ongoing threats and pressure from the Chechen authorities, in April 2012 Milashina was beaten outside her home in a Moscow suburb and had her laptop stolen.

She is one of a handful of journalists travelling in and out of the Republic of Dagestan, whose mountains serve as a hideout for groups of local militants with ties to Islamic State.</p> <p>The police and security services have been in a state of war with various armed groups there for more than a decade, with locals targeted by both sides. Since the early 2000s, militant groups have used apartment blocks and villages to target the police, and the authorities have shelled whole communities in response.</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t abandon these people, that\u2019s why I keep writing about Dagestan. Sometimes there is a hope I can help them,\u201d she says.</p> <p>In September, Gordienko published a story in Novaya Gazeta<strong> </strong>about two teenage shepherds apparently killed by the local security services while looking after livestock in the mountains. </p> <p>Early on 24 August, a neighbour discovered their bodies outside the village, dressed in new clothes and with guns hanging from their shoulders. The police claimed they had eliminated two terrorists who had fired at them. </p> <p>After investigating the killing, Gordienko concluded it was a set-up. She is now calling for an official investigation in the belief that the police officers decided to kill the young men and present them as militants.</p> <h2><strong>The Orthodox church</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"723fa0f104c84f20a2d63c53669fa11ccc00428d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/723fa0f104c84f20a2d63c53669fa11ccc00428d/0_323_4928_2957/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Patriarch Kirill poses for a photo at Russia\u2019s Bellingshausen Antarctic station.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Patriarch Kirill poses for a photo at Russia\u2019s Bellingshausen Antarctic station.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tass</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Svetlana Reiter started her career by looking into the number and plight of homeless children in Russia, and the state of healthcare. \u201cBut when you write about sick children,\u201d she explains, \u201cvery soon you start asking why there is a shortage of medicine for them.\u201d</p> <p>Working for popular outlets including Esquire Russia, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://lenta.ru/\">Lenta.ru</a> and RBC Daily, Reiter investigated inflated government contracts that put up the price of medicines. </p> <p>Most recently, Reiter, 40, has investigated the relationship between businesses and the Russian Orthodox church. </p> <p>She exposed the fact that the church\u2019s leader, Patriarch Kirill, ran up a bill of more than 20m roubles (\u00a3250,000) during a trip to Latin America in February. According to Reiter\u2019s report, more than half of this money was spent on the patriarch\u2019s <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/18/head-of-russian-orthodox-church-quizzes-penguin-on-antarctica-visit\">trip to Antarctica</a>, where he presided over a service at the only church on the continent and went on a sightseeing trip to see penguins.</p> <p>Though the wealth of the church is well known, critical articles about the patriarch are rare in Russia: the leader is a powerful political actor and close friend of the president. She faced a wave of abuse after her piece was published, with calls for her to be excommunicated. Fellow journalist Alexander Soldatov, editor of Credo.ru, was forced to leave the country after publishing critical articles.</p> <p>Reiter, who has two daughters, knows the dangers but the pull to investigate further is too great. \u201cThere is always a balance between a common sense and curiosity in our profession. But very often curiosity pushes you forward,\u201d she says.</p>",
  "<p>When I\u2019m travelling in a place I don\u2019t know, I always have a point-and-shoot digital camera in my pocket \u2013 and go looking for \u201cfound onomatopoeias\u201d like these children\u2019s firecrackers. I shot them in San Francisco when I was over for an exhibition, walking around Chinatown.</p> <p>Onomatopoeias have always interested me, these almost animalistic, pre-verbal sounds. Once I had noticed one, I started seeing them everywhere. I have favourites: a cap reading \u201cBuzz\u201d worn by a guy with a buzz-cut in Florida; a dance hall in Innsbruck called <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/clubflashibk/\">Flash</a>, which reminded me of Flashdance; a do-not-disturb sign in Boston that just said: \u201cShhhh.\u201d I have a hairspray called <a href=\"https://www.freemanbeauty.com/products/psssst\">Psssst!</a> and a keyring for a car that says Vroom. It\u2019s nice when the object and the sound fit so well. </p> <p>You can learn a lot about a culture with photographs like this. It\u2019s like being an anthropologist. In San Francisco, I went to this really bad neighbourhood and noticed a lot of cotton buds. I found out later that crystal meth users clean their pipes with them. So suddenly this common object told me something new about where I was. The same with cigarettes. I was photographing cigarette butts and found that, in the East End of London, people smoke right up to the filter. But if you go to Mayfair, people take just a few puffs and throw them away. They can afford the luxury of not smoking it all.</p> <p>I turn all my onomatopoeia images into a big slideshow that accompanies a live performance. A singer, <a href=\"http://www.shelleyhirsch.com/shelley/bio.shtml\">Shelley Hirsch</a>, sees the projections and reacts to them: she never knows what\u2019s coming next. Her reading of the word in an expressive way will then trigger a song, or she\u2019ll tell a story. This image reminded her of a little girl being afraid of firecrackers. For an image of <a href=\"http://www.champagnepommery.com/en/our-products/pop-en/pop-2\">Pop champagne</a>, she started singing some cheesy song about bubbles. </p> <p>There\u2019s a strange relationship between performer and audience and image. While the photographer might be thinking about lighting and facial expression, you never know how the viewer is going to engage with the image. Maybe a tie someone is wearing triggers some memoriesfor them.</p> <p>People just take snapshots of anything these days. This is a much more interesting way to use photography. I\u2019m more interested in shooting unusual things, rather than my meal or my pet.</p> <ul> <li><a href=\"http://whitecube.com/exhibitions/christian_marclay_bermondsey_outdoor_projection_2016/\">Marclay\u2019s six new animations</a> are screening at White Cube Bermondsey, London, 5-10 October.</li> </ul> <h2>Christian Marclay\u2019s CV</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"6e51a0f8c8695259b936744202050d1ee338bdd9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6e51a0f8c8695259b936744202050d1ee338bdd9/130_306_2052_2746/747.jpg\" alt=\"Christian Marclay.\" width=\"747\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Christian Marclay.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rafa Rivas/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Born:</strong> San Rafael, California, 1955.</p> <p><strong>Trained:</strong> \u00c9cole Sup\u00e9rieure des Beaux-Arts, Geneva; Massachusetts College of Art, Boston.</p> <p><strong>Influences:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2011/sep/02/lee-friedlander-america-by-car-in-pictures\">Lee Friedlander</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2002/oct/22/guardianobituaries.arts\">Manuel \u00c1lvarez Bravo</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/mar/14/ed-ruscha-marcel-duchamp-retrospective-los-angeles\">Marcel Duchamp</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/tomserviceblog/2012/aug/13/john-cage-contemporary-music-guide\">John Cage</a>.</p> <p><strong>High point:</strong> \u201cMy first record, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2005/feb/14/popandrock\">Record Without a Cover</a>, in 1985.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Low point:</strong> \u201cIn the early 80s, I gave up on visual arts, and got totally engaged in music.

  "<p>Some years ago, while working as a district nurse at a GP practice, one of the receptionists came to tell me she had just taken a phone call from the son of a patient to say he had returned from the Dignitas clinic in Switzerland. His mother, who had recently been diagnosed with a neurological condition that would kill her slowly, and with loss of dignity and independence, had taken her life there.</p> <p>The reception staff were shocked. I was shocked. My team was shocked. I was dismayed that this lady, who I had known for a number of years, had to go to another country to receive the care she wanted and to die earlier than she should have.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/oct/11/lets-talk-about-death-what-does-it-mean-to-you\">Let's talk about death: what does it mean to you?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The following day her GP asked me what Lily* had been up to over the past few days. You can tell from this perhaps that Lily was a lady who made demands on the surgery team. The GP was upset when I told her what had happened, and contacted Lily\u2019s son.</p> <p>I had known this lady for a number of years and looked after her husband when he returned from hospital after surgery. Lily would turn up at the surgery immaculately dressed and would not leave until she obtained what she thought would help him. I would sometimes receive a phone call from the surgery asking me to come back from my house calls to see her. I was not the only person at the surgery with whom she could be quite insistent. Yet even as she frustrated us all, I found it noble the way she fought for what she thought was best for her husband. </p> <p>After he died I saw her only occasionally. A few years later her health deterioriated and I became involved in her care. Occasionally I found it frustrating when, in the middle of a clinic or housecall, I would be contacted to say Lily wanted to see or speak to me.

  "<p>I have waited a long time to see Mazher Mahmood brought to book. Going back to 1988, when I was his boss at the Sunday Times, I discovered he had tried to pass the blame for his own error on to a news agency.</p> <p>He went to extraordinary lengths to try to cover up his mistake and, when found out, quickly resigned in order to avoid being dismissed. </p> <p>I have watched his career closely ever since. As recently as the Leveson inquiry, in 2012, he was still denying the truth of that Sunday Times incident. </p> <p>But Lord Justice Leveson was not fooled and forced him to admit he had acted improperly,<a href=\"http://www.levesoninquiry.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Transcript-of-Morning-Hearing-25-January-20121.txt\"> telling him he had been disingenuous in his evidence</a>.</p> <p>The Old Bailey jury were not fooled either. And they are far from the first set of jurors to have seen through his lies and to be concerned about his questionable journalistic methods.<br></p> <p>In 1999, a jury who were asked to convict a young peer, the Earl of Hardwicke, on a drugs charge took the extraordinary step of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1999/sep/23/linusgregoriadis\">sending a note to the judge</a> in which they said: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Had we been allowed to take the extreme provocation into account, we would undoubtedly have reached a different verdict.</p> </blockquote> <p>Provocation was the name of Mahmood\u2019s journalistic game. In almost every one of his investigative stories, the methodology was the same: induce the \u201ctarget\u201d to buy a quantity of drugs, publish the story \u201cin the public interest\u201d and turn the target into a \u201cvictim\u201d.</p> <p>Of course, those victims should not have broken the law. But what the Hardwicke jury realised, and I have written about in many other cases, is the disproportionate level of inducement involved.</p> <p>Mahmood offered his targets just enough, and sometimes a great deal more than enough, to ensure that they would be coaxed into doing his bidding in order to win the prize, be it a job offer, money, fame or, in one case, a sexual liaison.</p> <p>That bidding inevitably involved them obtaining a quantity of drugs. That they did so was foolish and, yes, a breach of the law. But in every case they were sorely tempted. </p> <p>Worse by far was the way in which people were enticed into criminal activities by Mahmood\u2019s use of agents provocateur. One, Florim Gashi, came forward to speak to the Guardian. Another person spoke to Panorama. </p> <p>As Gashi said of Mahmood\u2019s victims: \u201cI tricked them.\u201d By that time, with a record of dishonesty, it was easy for lawyers to dismiss his evidence. But his sincerity shone through and he has never deviated from his accounts of what he did on behalf of Mahmood.</p> <p>Make no mistake: people suffered because of Mahmood\u2019s stories. I have lost count of the solicitors who have contacted me down the years pleading for me to highlight the way in which their clients\u2019 lives were wrecked by News of the World exposures.</p> <p>I have given statements about Mahmood to more than half a dozen lawyers and then watched as the cases have come to nought, usually because judges refused to countenance historic evidence.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5524ab6275f755ac17fb12bc335636515d1826cb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5524ab6275f755ac17fb12bc335636515d1826cb/0_35_1034_620/1000.png\" alt=\"The Independent on Sunday on 16 April, 2006.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">My piece in the Independent on Sunday on 16 April, 2006.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Clipshare</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>So the pattern of Mahmood\u2019s methodology, which was the key to revealing his duplicity, did not emerge. I ploughed a lonely furrow for several years in what he rightly called my campaign against him. I was open about it. In 2006, the Independent on Sunday carried a piece by me headlined \u201cWhy I am out to nail Mazher Mahmood\u201d.</p> <p>If other journalists, most especially the police, had taken notice then, a lot of innocent people would have been spared from his brand of journalism.</p> <p>As I have written before, and said often, he brought investigative journalism, and all tabloid journalism, into disrepute. Yet successive News of the World (and Sun on Sunday) editors stoutly defended him and his methods. </p> <p>Did they not note the embarrassing courtroom reverses? The trial that followed the fake Victoria Beckham kidnap plot collapsed, as did the high-profile trial of three men prosecuted for buying a non-existent substance, \u201cred mercury\u201d, in order to build a non-existent \u201cdirty bomb\u201d.</p> <p>But it was the low-profile cases, in which vulnerable people ended up in trouble, that break the heart. In 2005, an Albanian immigrant, Besnik Qema, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2011/jan/31/newsoftheworld-mazher-mahmood\">was sentenced to four-and-half years in prison</a> for obtaining cocaine and forged identity documents on behalf of a \u201cwoman\u201d who contacted him through an Albanian-language internet chatroom.</p> <p>The woman was Gashi, operating on Mahmood\u2019s behalf. Qema spent years in jail before a lawyer decided to fight on his behalf and took his case to the Criminal Cases Review Commission.</p> <p>After considering Qema\u2019s story it declared the conviction unsafe and referred it back to the crown court in 2010. There, the prosecuting authorities offered no evidence and the conviction was quashed. But no action was taken against Mahmood. Why not?</p>",
  "<p>In the course of his long career, the undercover journalist known as the Fake Sheikh bragged about the number of people he\u2019d sent to prison. Back in 2011, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/jan/25/leveson-inquiry-bob-crow-mazher-mahmood-live\" title=\"\">during a melodramatic appearance at the Leveson inquiry</a>, Mazher Mahmood declared that he was \u201cproud to have jailed paedophiles and drug dealers\u201d. Now, in a stunning reversal of fortune, the famously camera-shy Fake Sheikh may be facing a prison sentence himself.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/oct/05/fake-sheikh-mazher-mahmood-tulisa-contostavlos-trial\">'Fake Sheikh' Mazher Mahmood guilty of tampering with Tulisa trial evidence</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Mahmood <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/oct/05/fake-sheikh-mazher-mahmood-tulisa-contostavlos-trial\" title=\"\">has been convicted, along with his driver Alan Smith</a>, of tampering with evidence in the drugs trial of the singer Tulisa Contostavlos. That trial was the result of a \u201csting\u201d operation reported in the Sun on Sunday. Both men have now been found guilty of conspiracy to pervert the course of justice, an offence which carries a jail sentence of up to two years. &#xa0;</p> <p>It is all a far cry from the days when drug dealers, sports stars and celebrities who had fallen on hard times allegedly quaked at the mention of the Fake Sheikh. His scalps included members of the Pakistan cricket team, three of whom were jailed for match-fixing during a tour of England <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/pakistan-cricket-betting-scandal\" title=\"\">in 2010</a>. Mahmood, by contrast, was celebrated. He won a series of press awards for the story.</p> <p>The reporter boasted to <a href=\"http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20140122145147/http:/www.levesoninquiry.org.uk/\" title=\"\">the Leveson inquiry into the culture, practices and ethics of the British press</a> that he had been responsible for more than 250 successful criminal prosecutions, although critics say the figure is closer to 70. He claimed that he lived under \u201ca constant death threat\u201d, persuading the inquiry that he could give evidence only in a courtroom cleared of everyone except lawyers. Reporters had to listen to the audio feed of his evidence from another room, allowing him to protect his identity \u2013 and increasing his mystique.</p> <p>But there was always a darker side&#xa0;to&#xa0;Mazher Mahmood\u2019s self-mythologising, with&#xa0;some of his best-known stories falling apart long before the Contostavlos debacle.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The real scandal in this case is that Mahmood was allowed to operate as a wholly unregulated police force</p> <footer> <cite>Ben Rose</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Stings are part of newspaper life, the most recent being the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/26/sam-allardyce-fa-newspaper-sting-england-manager\" title=\"\">Daily Telegraph\u2019s revelations about Sam Allardyce</a>, which prompted his resignation as England manager. But there is a difference between investigating pre-existing allegations of corruption in sport \u2013 or, indeed, a prominent MP\u2019s willingness to pay for sex while chairing an inquiry into prostitution law, as the Sunday Mirror did recently \u2013 and persuading people such as Contostavlos to act entirely out of character, which is what, we must now conclude, Mahmood did.</p> <p>What next? Mahmood and Smith are due in court for sentencing later this month. But even then, it doesn\u2019t end. Big questions remain for police and prosecutors who relied heavily on Mahmood\u2019s investigations and testimony in a number of contested cases. Surely Ben Rose, who defended Contostavlos at her drugs trial, went to the heart of the matter: \u201cThe real scandal in this case is that Mahmood was allowed to operate as a wholly unregulated police force, \u2018investigating\u2019 crimes without the safeguards which apply to the police,\u201d he said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6e700dafe44013b956ad2095d5679d06a3459bc7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6e700dafe44013b956ad2095d5679d06a3459bc7/0_55_4403_2643/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Mazher Mahmood spread in the last edition of the News of the World on 10 July 2011\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Mazher Mahmood spread in the last edition of the News of the World on 10 July 2011</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Handout/NLA Clipshare</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Following the collapse of the Contostavlos trial, the crown prosecution service dropped a number of criminal cases in which Mahmood was due to be a witness, and announced a review of 25 past convictions. The criminal cases review commission is currently reappraising six cases involving celebrities who were convicted after being targeted by Mahmood.</p> <p>But the questions go further than that. Consider that some police officers have privately complained that all weekend leave was cancelled when their superiors got wind that Mahmood was about to publish a big expos\u00e9 in the News of the World. If true, is that level of complicity at all appropriate?</p> <p>Surely such allegations, indeed all issues raised by the case, demonstrate the urgent need for ministers to set up the second part of the Leveson inquiry,&#xa0;specifically to examine relationships between the police and the&#xa0;press and whether they work towards the public good. It appears to have been parked. The very public fall of&#xa0;Mazher Mahmood tells us it must now be set up without delay.</p>",

This is the place where three countries meet, an epitome of the dream of a borderless Europe, where you can cross the three frontiers in two steps.</p> <p>\u201cFor our generation it is normal to cross the border,\u201d says Michael, a 24-year old architecture student at the University of Aachen, who is visiting with his mother and a friend. \u201cI feel more European than German and I like the fact that I can go and work in the Netherlands or Belgium if I want to.\u201d </p> <p>Down in the valley on the Dutch side lies Vaals, a bustling market town of 10,000 people. Almost half the population (44%) were born in another country: one third are Germans, but people have moved here from all over Europe; last year the town took in 30 Syrian refugees. <br></p> <p>\u201cWe are living in a European region and people cross the borders without really thinking of it,\u201d says Reg van Loo, Vaals\u2019 mayor. Apart from a few road signs and buzzing text messages (telecoms are national), there is little to show you are crossing a border. </p> <p>For some EU leaders this remains the European dream. \u201cBorders are the worst invention ever made by politicians,\u201d Jean-Claude Juncker, European commission president, and Luxemburger, <a href=\"http://www.alpbach.org/en/forum2016/programme-2016/keynotes/\">declared in August</a>, just as checks were being tightened across the continent.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Borders are the worst invention ever made by politicians</p> <footer> <cite>Jean-Claude Juncker</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But in living memory, Europe\u2019s borders were far more tightly controlled. In the aftermath of the second world war, Vaals was a hotbed for smugglers. Packets of coffee and cigarettes were lobbed over border fences into a ruined Germany, as locals sought to cash in on shortages. By the 1970s the Dutch were driving across the border, car boots laden with undeclared West German hi-fis and cameras. \u201cVaals has always been a very plural place,\u201d Van Loo says, describing how 18th-century Catholics and Protestants of all denominations could worship in the town when it was forbidden elsewhere.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/maps/embed/aug/2016-08-25T12:41:15.html\" data-alt=\"Germany, Netherlands and Belgium meeting map\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/maps/embed/aug/2016-08-25T12:41:15.html\">Germany, Netherlands and Belgium meeting map</a> </figure>  <p>Yet this dream of freedom to live and work anywhere in the European Union has been called into question like never before since the Brexit vote.

David Cameron thought he could persuade the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, to grant him limits on EU migrants. <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-29874392\"> He was wrong</a>: the former prime minister did get an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/07/david-camerons-emergency-brake-wins-fans-across-the-continent\">emergency brake</a> to ban EU migrants from getting immediate access to benefits, but this was dismissed as useless by Conservative backbenchers set on leaving the EU.<br></p> <p>Since Cameron\u2019s renegotiation, it has been clear the EU would not budge on free movement of people. Martin Schulz, the president of the European parliament, said last month that the EU\u2019s four freedoms \u2013 people, services, goods and capital \u2013 were inseparable, echoing a consensus among EU leaders that shows no sign of cracking. \u201cI refuse to imagine a Europe where lorries and hedge funds are free to cross borders but citizens are not,\u201d Schulz said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f3c57db453e7bf55ee6ce0d906a963a224b2357d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f3c57db453e7bf55ee6ce0d906a963a224b2357d/0_0_5150_3427/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Passengers relax before departure at the cafe bar at Fryderyk Chopin Airport Warsaw.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"665\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Passengers relax before departure at the cafe bar at Fryderyk Chopin Airport Warsaw.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Merkel on Wednesday made her clearest statement yet \u2013 saying full access to the single market could only come in exchange for signing up to the four freedoms. \u201cAnything else would amount to a systemic challenge for the entire European Union,\u201d she told the BGA trade association.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Free movement runs through many fundamental questions for the EU, says Andr\u00e9 Sapir, a professor at the Bruegel thinktank and influential former adviser to the European commission: the relationship between western and eastern Europe, how the EU manages an unprecedented influx of refugees, as well as attitudes to Turkey and its long-stalled hopes of joining the EU.</p> <p>\u201cWe are not simply making a deal with the UK. The number of dimensions here is endless,\u201d Sapir said. \u201cIf you start putting brakes on this now, in a sense, you are going back on the original EU project. It is one thing the UK leaving, it is another one to start tinkering with the EU as we know it.\u201d</p> <p>Free movement was part of the European idea from the start, when six countries embarked on integration nearly 60 years ago at the Conservatori palace in Rome. The Treaty of Rome and its four freedoms created the fledgling European Economic Community that became today\u2019s EU.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fc6ae2c33849d810dcd7f2263a085947df5fd0ec\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fc6ae2c33849d810dcd7f2263a085947df5fd0ec/0_235_2482_1489/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The signing of the Treaty of Rome in 25 March 1957.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The signing of the Treaty of Rome in 25 March 1957.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But free movement was not carved on stone tablets and initially was restricted to workers. Damian Chalmers, professor of EU law at the London School of Economics, describes the original provision as an afterthought tacked on to please the Italian government. Of the three biggest founding members, France had got farm subsidies and Germany had abolished tariffs for its industrial goods. The Italian government, grappling with the poor southern part of the country, wanted a payoff, says Chalmers, describing Italian workers who moved north as the \u201ccentral-eastern Europeans of the 1950s\u201d.</p> <p>Free movement of workers did not become free movement of citizens until 1993, following another treaty, signed at Maastricht, a city deep in EU heartland that is a short distance from Vaals.<br></p> <p>After Maastricht, Europeans could not only work abroad but study or retire in other EU countries. Amid the surge in optimism following the fall of the Berlin wall, Brussels hoped that citizenship would give the European project the mass appeal it had always lacked.</p> <p>\u201cThe people you talk to in Brussels see [free movement] as central to the dream of a people\u2019s Europe, that is not just about multinationals,\u201d said Chalmers.</p> <p>But still, not many people felt starry-eyed about the EU, or much inclined to live abroad. Few EU nationals chose to move to another country, a fact that caused handwringing in the Brussels beltway around the turn of the century. Policymakers, about to embark on a single currency, fretted that Europe could never match the United States for labour mobility if a person from Manchester wouldn\u2019t move to Munich.</p> <p>That all changed when10 central and eastern European countries joined the EU in two waves in 2004 and 2007 (as well as the Mediterranean islands of Malta and Cyprus). By 2014, around 5% of the EU\u2019s working-age population was born in another member state, compared with just 1% in 2000. In the UK, the figure was 7% of the working-age population. <br></p> <p>Post the Brexit vote, Britain now wants to stop Europeans arriving. May told her Polish counterpart that the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/28/theresa-may-on-brexit-tour-of-eastern-europe\">Brexit vote was \u201ca very clear message\u201d</a> on demands to reduce EU migration \u2013 a message that has gone down badly in Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic and Slovakia. The four central European countries, known as the Visegr\u00e1d 4, have vowed to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/17/eastern-bloc-countries-will-uphold-citizens-rights-to-live-in-uk\">block any future deal with the UK </a>that limits the free movement of their citizens. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f50ade4053de5e2db4fad47e050ebef58e0c578c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f50ade4053de5e2db4fad47e050ebef58e0c578c/0_1_5785_3473/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Theresa May addresses the Conservative party conference\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Theresa May tells the Conservative party Britain is \u2018not leaving the European Union only to give up control of immigration again\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Xinhua/Barcroft Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But senior EU diplomats think the Visegr\u00e1d 4 will prioritise their compatriots already in the UK rather than future movers. <strong tabindex=\"-1\">\u201c</strong>Poland and Hungary will fight for their citizens already there, not for the future, because they could use the workforce back home,\u201d one senior European diplomat told the Guardian. </p> <p>The diplomat pointed out that central Europe was dependent on EU money to keep public works programmes going. \u201cI think they will be ready to make a concession,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are saying citizens\u2019 rights are important but behind the scenes <em tabindex=\"-1\">c\u2019est le fric </em>[it\u2019s the cash].\u201d</p> <p>The Brexit negotiations will turn on these kind of trade-offs, a complex haggle over soaring principle and sharp-elbowed self-interest involving 28 governments and three EU institutions.</p> <p>But this does not mean the British government will get the \u201cmaximum freedom\u201d to trade that May promised Conservative party activists.</p> <p>Sapir, the economist, is one of five high-powered policymakers who argued the EU should allow the UK generous access to the single market, without the fourth freedom. Unlimited free movement of people is not essential for economic integration, they <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://bruegel.org/2016/08/europe-after-brexit-a-proposal-for-a-continental-partnership/\">wrote in a Bruegel paper</a>, rather it is the element that makes the single market a political project. Yet in Brussels, Paris and Berlin, the blueprint was almost regarded as heresy. It might make economic sense, but it is \u201cpolitically naive\u201d, one senior EU diplomat said.</p> <p>And once the herculean task of Brexit is done, one curiosity for historians will be how far British voters\u2019 discontent chimed with the anxieties of their neighbours. Brussels has recently acceded to France\u2019s demand for reform of EU labour laws to make it harder for companies to hire cheap workers from eastern Europe and undercut locally agreed minimum wages.</p> <p>French anxieties about cheap workers or German worries about integrating refugees do not exactly reflect the British rejection of migration, but there are common threads. \u201cIn the name of austerity we have cut holes in our safety net to such a degree that many feel that the open economy is to their detriment in the short term and offers no prospects in the long term,\u201d one senior EU official said.</p> <p>Even in the self-styled heart of the EU region, people feel anxious and detached from the EU. Van Loo, a self-described \u201cEurope-minded mayor\u201d, says the EU needs to change, become less bureaucratic and allow greater regional variation. Many Dutch people share the British view that \u201ceverything that is going wrong is because of membership of the European Union\u201d, he says, a stance that troubles him.<br></p> <p>Despite these doubts, he does not think these anti-EU forces ever will sweep away the free flow of people in his three-country neighbourhood. \u201cWe will always find a way to cross the borders.\u201d</p>",

My early work then focused on people\u2019s personal growth after break-up or a divorce, which got me interested in what makes a relationship actually work.</p> <p><strong>The answer to everlasting love is complicated.</strong> There\u2019s so much variability between people that it\u2019s overzealous to make prescriptions about what people should do with their love life. So if you see an article which says, \u201cthree easy steps for lasting love\u201d it has to be a simplification and will only work for a small amount of people.</p> <p><strong>What actually matters in relationships is whether the two people are kind and emotionally stable. </strong>A lot of dating services match people based on how similar their personalities are, but this isn\u2019t predictive of long-term stability. What matters is whether the two people are secure and emotionally stable. If so, their relationship is more likely to be a success. And interestingly, if one of the pair is emotionally unstable, studies show that they will almost always be the one to break off the relationship. </p> <p><strong>People don\u2019t like that answer because being \u201cemotionally stable\u201d isn\u2019t the most exciting trait in the world.</strong> If you have a partner who is emotionally stable they may be predictable, but you\u2019ll have huge relationships advantages in the long run. You\u2019ll continue to reap benefits from an emotionally stable partner for years to come. Choosing someone like that is a long-term investment in your relationship.<br></p> <p><strong>Our heart rules our head when it comes to love</strong><strong>.</strong> There\u2019s a divide between our emotions and intellect in relationships \u2013 our emotions sometimes take us in one direction, say if we\u2019re attracted to someone really good looking or powerful \u2013 but these things don\u2019t matter long-term. There\u2019s an intellectual side to love where we know we need someone with a kind heart who is committed. So the answer to finding someone like that is to go with wisdom, not fleeting impulses \u2013 there\u2019s such an emphasis in our culture on the passionate side of love that the wise part often loses out.</p> <p><strong>In my work, I\u2019ve learnt s</strong><strong>o many strange things </strong><strong>about love</strong><strong>.</strong> Relationship are weird in wonderful ways. The most interesting thing is how much the small things matter in long-term love. There have been studies of people who have recently lost their spouse, and when you ask them: what do you miss the most? They always talk about small day-to-day details. One man said he missed that his wife knew he liked two lumps of sugar in his coffee, another said that they missed how their husband always forgot to take his gloves in the car. Small things that we take for granted are the driving force for loving relationships.</p> <p><strong>There\u2019s a lot of diversity of opinion </strong><strong>about love.</strong> By speaking to people I hear a lot of different perspectives about love, and try to be as open minded as possible. I have one way of looking a relationships \u2013 the scientific way \u2013 but art, literature and other ways of explaining love all relate to how relationships function.</p> <p><strong>The thing I enjoy most about my work is </strong><strong>that</strong><strong> I\u2019m tackling a big question \u2013 and a mystery. </strong>You\u2019re like a detective looking for clues in journal articles, or in the arts, or daily conversations. You take all these clues and try to find an answer you can articulate that\u2019s useful to everyday life. There\u2019s a divide between life and academic research. My goal is to translate complex research findings into relationship advice that is valuable to people.<br></p> <p><strong>I thrive off</strong><strong> </strong><strong>the</strong><strong> challenge of brid</strong><strong>g</strong><strong>ing science and life.</strong> Everyday people have much better questions about love than scientists. I realised this when I was teaching a class on romantic relationships. Students would have these insightful questions that tapped to core of psychological processes. That\u2019s one of things that got me into wanting to be a relationship writer. For example \u201chow to flirt with boy\u201d, or \u201chow to handle a breakup\u201d \u2013 we don\u2019t have access to good data on how to do these things.<br></p> <p><strong>The most challenging aspect of the work is that you have to boil down hundreds of studies into few lines.</strong> As a relationship writer, it\u2019s complicated because you have to have self-control by not going into details people don\u2019t care about \u2013 while trusting yourself to report accurately on huge diversity of opinion.<br></p> <p><strong>The psychology of relationships is</strong><strong> a crowded field.</strong> My tip for job seekers is to get really good at something that isn\u2019t relationships. For example, a psychology student could get really good at research methods, as it distinguishes you by having something other people don\u2019t have. Or if you wanted to go more into writing, become a good writer, and then you have an advantage over other people. I like the analogy that to be a relationship expert you have to be good at things people don\u2019t like to do \u2013 just like with romantic relationships. Are you willing to be persistent? Disciplined? Then you\u2019ve got what it takes.<br></p> <p><strong>Looking for a job?

One of Denver\u2019s newest breweries (it opened in February 2015), Ratio has six flagship beers on tap, each with its own distinct flavour and finish. Most popular are Repeater, an extra pale ale ($5), and Dear You, a French <em>saison</em> ale ($6).

  "<p>Councils are failing to monitor most schools in Britain for dangerous air pollution despite government advice, freedom of information requests have revealed.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>All Britain\u2019s 433 local councils were asked by the British Lung Foundation (BLF) whether they placed pollution monitors within 10 metres of school grounds. Of the 322 which replied, only 140 said they did. </p> <p>In urban areas identified by the World Health Organisation as having harmful levels of particulate pollution, nearly half were found to be monitoring only one or two schools. Less than one in three local authorities monitored more than two schools.</p> <p>Air quality monitoring guidance for the UK <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/69334/pb13081-tech-guidance-laqm-tg-09-090218.pdf\">is drawn up by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs</a> (Defra). The government does not insist that schools are monitored and local authorities are left to implement and interpret results and take action where needed. </p> <p>The survey showed \u201calarming discrepancies\u201d in council behaviour, said a BLF spokeswoman. Some used very simple diffusion tubes to measure only NO2 gas, but others monitored for different-sized particles called PM10s and 2.5s which are spewed out by traffic and industry, she said. </p> <p>Equally, some authorities monitored the air close to school playgrounds, but others measured air quality hundreds of metres away. </p> <p>\u201cThe guidance on monitoring that Defra gives local authorities needs to be revised and strengthened. Parents should be able to tell what their children are breathing, especially if they have conditions like asthma,\u201d the spokeswoman said.</p> <p>Concern about children\u2019s health has grown following new scientific research which has shown lung capacity can be permanently impaired by pollution at very early ages. </p> <p><a href=\"http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0109121\">A study</a> of 2,400 children at 25 schools across east London found children had 5-10% less lung capacity, with an increased risk of diseases such as asthma and bronchitis. </p> <p>According to the BLF, nearly 1 million schoolchildren up to 15 years old have been diagnosed with lung conditions. </p> <p>\u201cChildren and teaching staff are not being made fully aware of the health risks posed by air pollution. Local authorities need clear guidance to monitor the air that children breathe as well as more resources and funding to tackle it,\u201d said Russell Hobby, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u201cChildren\u2019s lung health is particularly vulnerable to air pollution, yet they are not being protected by the government\u2019s air quality monitoring guidance. There is a huge discrepancy in the levels of monitoring outside schools across the country, with many schools in the most harmfully polluted places not being monitored,\u201d said Dr Penny Woods, chief executive of British Lung Foundation.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>A an LGA spokesman said: \u201cCouncils follow guidelines on monitoring air pollution which are laid down by central government. These are to take a risk-based approach \u2013 monitoring those locations where members of the public might be regularly exposed. </p> <p>\u201cAs well as schools this could also include residential properties, hospitals and care homes \u2013 depending on which area is at greatest risk. Many schools are actually some distance from busy roads and therefore unlikely to have high air pollution levels.\u201d</p> <p>He added that the \u201creal issue\u201d was for councils to move from monitoring pollution to acting on it, which would take government support.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/may/16/boris-johnson-accused-of-burying-study-linking-pollution-and-deprived-schools\">A report</a> that was commissioned but not published by London city hall under Boris Johnson showed that the number of primary schools in the capital breaching EU pollution levels had fallen from 433 in 2010 to 357 in 2013.</p> <p><a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jul/01/children-at-nearly-90-london-secondary-schools-exposed-to-dangerous-air-pollution\">Another report</a>, for the mayor of London, found children at nearly 90 secondary schools in London regularly breathed illegal and dangerous levels of air pollution. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.howpollutedismyroad.org.uk/schools.php\">Research by the Campaign for Clean Air</a> found that 1,148 schools in London are within 150 metres of roads carrying 10,000 or more vehicles per day, and a total of 2,270 schools are within 400m of such roads. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u201cChildren across the UK are exposed to illegal levels of air pollution on a daily basis.

Most were GPs who specialised in women\u2019s health.</p> <p>Of the respondents, 54% had seen female patients requesting genital cosmetic surgery. Overall, 75% of GPs rated their knowledge of the surgery as inadequate and 97% said they had been asked by women of all ages about genital normality. </p> <p>More than half the GPs suspected psychological disturbances in their patients requesting the surgery such as depression, anxiety, relationship difficulties and body dysmorphic disorder.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2011/oct/14/designer-vagina-surgery\">Designer vagina surgery: snip, stitch, kerching!</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Surgery could sometimes lead to complications such as ongoing pain and could also affect sexual response, \u201cbecause the clitoris is not just a \u2018pea\u2019 as described in textbooks, but is a larger organ, most of it not visible to the eye\u201d, Simonis said.</p> <p>\u201cWhen we talk about adult women into their 20s of course they are entitled to make their own decisions about their body and surgery, provided they are well informed and have good information and don\u2019t have any mental health disorders that might be affecting their decision,\u201d Simonis said. </p> <p>\u201cBut the really vulnerable here are young women and teens impressed by what they see online and what a lot of the portrayals are like in pornography.

Famous as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/sep/16/derrick-rose-gang-rape-jane-doe-nba-knicks\">alleged victim raped by NBA star Derrick Rose</a> and two of his friends. Or as the alleged gold-digger seeking a $21.5m payoff. Either way, famous.</p> <p>Her lawyers argued the alleged rape was trauma enough without the world Googling her and rummaging through personal details laid bare in court. They said justice did not demand stripping her anonymity. They lost.</p> <p>The 30-year-old\u2019s name appears in the federal court calendar, a public document, and was cited in court on Tuesday even before the jury was selected. On Wednesday, as lawyers made opening statements, she hung her head and quietly cried.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/sep/21/derrick-rose-trial-anonymity-alleged-gang-rape\">Derrick Rose rape accuser's name to be made public during trial, judge rules</a> </p> </aside>  <p>On Thursday, 28-year-old Rose and the other defendants are due to appear in US district court in downtown Los Angeles, at which point the media floodgate may open and put a name and face to the alleged victim known until now as Jane Doe.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/new-york-knicks\">New York Knicks</a> point guard and two close friends, Randall Hampton and Ryan Allen, are accused of raping her while she was intoxicated in her LA apartment in the early hours of 27 August 2013. They admit taking turns having sex with her but say it was consensual.</p> <p>America\u2019s latest collision of celebrity and alleged sexual assault will be played out not in a criminal trial, but in civil litigation. </p> <p>If the defendants lose, they will be ordered to pay damages but not go to jail or have a criminal conviction. The Los Angeles police department\u2019s criminal investigation remains open, however, and detectives will monitor the trial for evidence that could trigger a criminal prosecution.</p> <p>Judge Michel Fitzgerald granted Doe a cloak of anonymity after she filed the lawsuit last year to not discourage victims of sexual assault from seeking justice. But in the interest of openness and of not prejudicing the jury, he ruled her identity should be revealed once the trial began. </p> <p>Critics are aghast. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Removing the protection serves only to open this survivor to intimidation and harassment</p> <footer> <cite>Meg Garvin</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cIt is incredibly unfortunate,\u201d said Meg Garvin, executive director of the National Crime Victim Law Institute. \u201cThe victim\u2019s name is not relevant to determining the facts of the case. Removing the protection serves only to open this survivor to intimidation and harassment and make the system less accessible.\u201d</p> <p>The decision tells victims to choose privacy or justice, Garvin said. \u201cBecause privacy is so critical to survivors, this is really a Hobson\u2019s choice.\u201d</p> <p>In pretrial skirmishing, Rose\u2019s lawyers made their strategy clear: depict the alleged victim as a sexually adventurous player who had fabricated a story to extort a fortune. She had no \u201clegitimate fear of shame, humiliation, or embarrassment\u201d because photos from her Instagram account were \u201csexual in n ature\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5314eace389040da9f2bf09a52713a8f206e9654\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5314eace389040da9f2bf09a52713a8f206e9654/0_244_5184_3110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Derrick Rose.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Derrick Rose.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mary Altaffer/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This all sounds familiar to Mark Shaw, an author and attorney who chronicled <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/sep/02/usa.julianborger\">Kobe Bryant\u2019s 2003 rape case</a>. A receptionist who accused the NBA star of raping her in his Colorado hotel room found her identity, and sexual and mental history, splashed across the news.</p> <p>\u201cI call it the accused\u2019s accuser defense. You try to ruin the reputation of the person who is doing the accusing,\u201d Shaw said. Bryant\u2019s lawyers were so effective that the alleged victim declined to testify and settled the civil case. Criminal charges were dropped. \u201cThey weakened her so much she couldn\u2019t do it. The poor woman finally just gave up.\u201d</p> <p>The case against Rose, in contrast, is going ahead. The court of public opinion is divided.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I call it the accused\u2019s accuser defense.

Some blogs and fringe news sites have published her name, and mainstream outlets may follow once she testifies, if not before.</p> <p>A day and a half of jury selection produced a jury of six women and two men on Wednesday. None were African American, unlike the defendants.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/sep/16/derrick-rose-gang-rape-jane-doe-nba-knicks\">Derrick Rose rape case: victim's lawyers call for NBA to investigate</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Both sides agree on the following: Rose and the alleged victim dated on and off from 2011, entailing consensual intercourse. Several times Rose proposed group sex but was rebuffed. On the night of 26 August 2013 the plaintiff went with a female friend to Rose\u2019s Beverly Hills home. She became inebriated and after midnight took a taxi back to her apartment. Rose, Hampton and Allen arrived there a short time later and had intercourse with her and left. </p> <p>In his opening statement the alleged victim\u2019s attorney, Waukeen McCoy, showed a clip of Rose\u2019s deposition in which he was asked if he knew the meaning of consent. \u201cNo, but can you tell me?\u201d he replied.<br></p> <p>McCoy gave lurid details of the disputed encounter, telling the jury his client drifted \u201cin and out of consciousness\u201d during intercourse. In a pretrial deposition the alleged victim said she woke after dawn with her dress around her neck, lubricant on her legs, a burning sensation between her legs and condoms around the bed.</p> <p>Rose\u2019s attorney, Mark Baute, gave a dramatically different version, saying the woman was coherent and had invited the men to have sex, then tried to cash in. \u201cThis lawsuit is a fake ... a sad effort to get a lottery hit \u2013 nothing more.\u201d<br></p> <p>Both sides dispute the meaning and significance of texts the woman and Rose exchanged before and after the encounter, some involving taxi fares and a sex belt.</p> <p>The Knicks star was expected to attend court on Thursday, when witness testimony will begin.<br></p> <p>In his deposition Rose said he did not discuss with his friends the purpose of their visit because it was obvious: \u201cWe men. You can assume.\u201d</p> <p>Earlier this week, making his debut for the Knicks in Houston, Rose told the media he welcomed the chance to clear his name. \u201cI wanted to take it to court because I didn\u2019t want to settle. I don\u2019t feel like I did anything wrong. If I go up there and just tell my side of the story, I think I\u2019ll be all right.\u201d</p>"
