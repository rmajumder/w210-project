  "<p>A man has been arrested in Northern Ireland over a televised armed assault on a boxing bout weigh-in in Dublin which sparked a gangland feud that has so far claimed ten lives. </p> <p>The 46-year-old was detained on Monday evening in Strabane, Co Tyrone. The Police Service of Northern Ireland carried out the arrest operation using a European Arrest Warrant that may see the suspect extradited to the Irish Republic.</p> <p>He has been detained in connection with murder and firearms charges, the PSNI said. The arrest warrant allows for suspects to be extradited between EU states.</p> <p>The man arrested will appear at Belfast recorder\u2019s court on Tuesday morning. In the attack at the Regency Hotel in north Dublin in February, 33-year-old David Byrne was shot dead and two men were injured.</p> <p>The attack was filmed and photographed as a live TV stream was recording a weigh-in ahead of a boxing bout taking place in the Irish capital that weekend titled \u201cClash of the Clans\u201d.</p> <p>Video and still photographs captured the armed assault including men dressed like armed Irish police officers carrying AK47 rifles into the hotel. One of the gunmen involved in the shootings was seen dressed as a woman. <br></p> <p>The killing of David Byrne was carried out by gangsters loyal to convicted arch-criminal Gerry \u2018The Monk\u2019 Hutch. The Regency Hotel ambush was a revenge attack for the killing the previous September of Gary Hutch, a nephew of \u2018The Monk\u2019. <br></p> <p>Gary Hutch was murdered by associates of Costa del Sol-convicted Irish drug smuggler Christy Kinahan. Kinahan\u2019s associates believed Gary Hutch had betrayed a drug shipment in Spain. <br></p> <p>However, the ensuing gangland war following the Regency shootings has resulted in \u2018The Monk\u2019/Hutch crime gang sustaining all of the casualties since the David Byrne murder at the hotel.</p> <p>Ten men are dead including Gerry Hutch\u2019s brother as well as an innocent man, Trevor O\u2019Neill, whom members of the Kinahan gang shot dead in front of his wife and children in Majorca last month. They had mistaken O\u2019Neill for being a member of The Hutch gang.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p>",
  "<p>Samsung has told Australian Galaxy Note 7 owners to turn off their phones and return them to stores after reports the phone\u2019s batteries caught fire or exploded while charging.</p> <p>About 51,000 phones were voluntarily recalled in Australia on Monday by Samsung Electronics Australia, following similar moves overseas, citing \u201cisolated battery cell issues\u201d.</p> <p>The company said Samsung customers could receive replacements or full refunds and courtesy devices would be available on Wednesday for those who had to return their phones.</p> <p>The phone was first released in selected markets including Korea and the US.

In this instance, if the service can no longer be provided because the phone is dangerous, you might have a right under the guarantees within consumer law to cancel the service.\u201d </p>",
  "<p>Parents are still packing their children\u2019s school lunchboxes with junk food, despite high-profile awareness campaigns on childhood obesity and guidance provided by consumer groups, research has found.</p> <p>The Leeds University study published on Tuesday found just 1.6% of packed lunches for primary school children met tough nutritional standards set for their classmates eating in the school canteen.</p> <p>About half of all primary school pupils take a packed lunch to school. Researchers found that only 1 in 5 lunchboxes contained any vegetables or salad, while 52%-60% contained too many sweet and savoury snacks, or sugary drinks (42%), leading to high levels of saturated fat, sugar and salt and not enough minerals and vitamins. </p> <p>The study, described as \u201ceye opening\u201d by lead researcher Dr Charlotte Evans, saw only a fractional improvement from a decade ago, when 1.1% of lunches passed the standard set for school meals. The minority of children (17%) who eat vegetables and salad had not altered since 2006, it found.</p> <p>The report found some progress: for instance the majority of packed lunches examined by researchers passed the standards for protein (95%) and vitamin C (75%). There was also a significant reduction in sugary drinks, 46% in 2016 compared with 61%, and a reduction in chocolate-based snacks. But there was no improvement for savoury snacks, such as crisps, found in 60% of packed lunches.</p> <p>Three out of the 300-odd lunchboxes examined by researchers, in 12 different English primary schools, scored zero \u2013 a similar proportion to that found in 2006. One contained blackcurrant squash, a packet of hula hoops and a chocolate roll. </p> <p>The first statutory school meal standard was introduced in 2006 due to growing evidence linking poor health in adults with obesity or poor diet in children. They limit the amount of foods high in salt, sugar and fats and stipulate that school meals should provide a third of a child\u2019s nutritional requirements. However, although Ofsted says schools must have a policy on packed lunches, there is no law requiring them to abide by the same standards.</p> <p>Evans, a nutritional epidemiologist, said that she believed the wealth of information on sugar in sweetened drinks may have had an impact on the reduction in the numbers in lunchboxes. But she added that more needed to be done by retailers, food manufacturers and schools if improvements are to be made overall.</p> <p> Evans said: \u201cI hope the results of the study are an eye-opener, highlighting that more stringent policies need to be introduced if we want to see real change in the nutritional value of children\u2019s packed lunches. New policies for schools, food manufacturers and retailers are needed, which will require strong support from government and stakeholders if progress is to be made.\u201d</p> <p>The report recommends that primary schools introduce a policy restricting sweetened drinks and encouraging water, salad and fruit. It also suggested parents pack smaller portions of the unhealthy snacks, such as packets of crisps that are around 15g rather than 26g and chocolate cakes and biscuits of 20g. More choices of snacks low in saturated fats and sugars and higher in fibre were needed, it said.</p> <p>The children\u2019s lunches that met the standard all contained sandwiches with a protein filling and some salad.</p> <p>Evans said: \u201cParents struggle, and there are many reasons why children don\u2019t have better quality lunches \u2013 cost, peer pressure, convenience, time. Providing information to parents is a start. <br></p> <p>\u201cHowever, we do need to do more than provide information to parents to see a greater impact, such as improving school policies, reformulating products and reducing portions of snacks given to young children. For example, providing a small portion of crisps in a sealed container rather than the full bag.\u201d</p> <p>Few packed lunches met the standards for energy (12%), vitamin A (17 %), iron (26%) or zinc (16%), due to the lack of fresh salad and vegetables, the dearth of non-processed meat or fish as well as the lack of whole-grain bread.</p> <p>Sharon Hodgson MP, chair of the all-party parliamentary group for school food, said: \u201cThe research highlights the need for more action to be taken on food put in children\u2019s packed lunches, something which the school food APPG has recently called for. Despite positive moves with regards to the food provided as part of a school meal, food brought in by children in their packed lunches is lagging behind. Therefore we need more action to be taken if we want to see positive changes.\u201d<br></p> <p>Flora, which commissioned the research, is calling on the government to raise awareness and to do more to ensure the national standards for school food are being met in packed lunches. It has distributed 631,000 lunchboxes containing a healthy lunch planner and made available tips online.<br></p> <p><br></p>",
  "<p>Only 3% of UK householders think there is a stigma attached to wasting food, while many try to save money by switching off lights or turning down the heating, instead of reducing food waste, according to a report.</p> <p>The Sainsbury\u2019s survey of food waste habits shows that the vast majority of people fail to see the value of watching out for food waste, compared with other money-saving habits that have become second nature.</p> <p>According to the poll of more than 5,000 UK adults, 74% of householders actively turn lights off when they leave a room and 55% turn down the heating. Nearly one-third (32%) have changed energy suppliers to keep household bills down, saving an average of \u00a3200 a year.</p> <p>Collectively, these changes would save \u00a3305 a year, less than half of the \u00a3700 a typical family wastes on food that goes uneaten and is thrown away.</p> <p>In January, Sainsbury\u2019s launched a partnership with the town of Swadlincote in Derbyshire, where it is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/01/sainsburys-swadlincote-derbyshire-town-1m-food-waste\">spending \u00a31m to cut food waste</a> by trialling new technology. The market town beat 188 rival areas to be awarded the project and the supermarket is planning to spend \u00a310m over the next five years to develop similar schemes across the UK.</p> <p>Working with the <a href=\"http://www.wrap.org.uk/food-waste-reduction\">government\u2019s food advisory body, Wrap</a>, the initiative will be measurable so that it can be used as a blueprint for the future. Ideas include testing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/14/tech-innovations-that-could-reduce-food-waste\">smarter kitchen appliances such as fridges</a> to allow people can check on their phone what they have at home and <a href=\"http://olioex.com/\">food-sharing apps such as Olio</a>.</p> <p>The Sainsbury\u2019s chief executive, Mike Coupe, said: \u201cWe know our customers are concerned about food waste in their own homes, which is why we\u2019ve committed \u00a310m to help tackle the issue as part of our \u2018waste less, save more\u2019 programme.</p> <p>\u201cWasting food has become so normal, there is now no stigma attached to throwing food away. The report shows that people are cost-conscious and making concerted efforts to turn off lights and minimise energy use. However, people are still overlooking the much bigger savings that could be delivered by simply throwing away less food.\u201d</p> <p>On Wednesday, Sainsbury\u2019s will launch its first waste less, save more advertising campaign, aimed at helping householders save and store food more efficiently.</p> <p>Richard Swannell, the director of sustainable food systems at Wrap, said: \u201cWasting food costs \u00a3700 a year for the average family. That\u2019s money that could be spent on everyday essentials. Both Sainsbury\u2019s and Wrap want to help people see the benefits in making the most of their food.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Human rights and equality campaigners are demanding an investigation into the decision to give the contract to run a discrimination helpline to G4S, the scandal-hit global security firm.</p> <p>A number of organisations, including Liberty, Tell Mama and Inquest, have written to Harriet Harman, the chair of the joint committee on human rights, and Maria Miller, the chair of the women and equalities select committee, to express \u201cprofound concern\u201d over the awarding of the contract to run the Equality Advisory and Support Service (EASS) to G4S. <br></p> <p>They want the contract, due to begin on 1 October, to be halted until an inquiry is held into both the tendering process and the suitability of G4S to deliver the service properly. They claim that G4S is \u201cmanifestly ill-equipped to provide advice on discrimination and human rights\u201d and that the public would be unlikely to have confidence in it. </p> <p>The Law Centres Network, which represents 40 law centres in the UK and is one of the signatories to the letter, has begun a legal challenge to the tendering process and the awarding of the contract. The charity, which provides free legal advice to people on low incomes, accused the government of failing to properly assess the shortcomings of the EASS with stakeholders and said that it did not properly consider how to reform the service with the Equality and Human Rights Commission, which ran it previously.</p> <p>In March, a House of Lords committee recommended that the government restore the helpline to the EHRC. A number of stakeholders told the committee that the decision to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/apr/03/a4e-major-government-contract\">outsource the service</a> had led to a \u201cdisconnect\u201d between disabled people and the body charged with advancing equality and human rights. When run by EHRC, it highlighted trends and issues important to them, they said. The matter is scheduled for debate in the House of Lords on Tuesday.</p> <p>The letter, sent on 5 September and <a href=\"https://www.liberty-human-rights.org.uk/sites/default/files/Joint%20NGO%20letter%20to%20Parliament%20re%20G4S%20EASS%20contract%20Final.pdf\">signed by 41 organisations</a>, said the tendering process was flawed, \u201clacked openness\u201d, and did not require a contractor to have any relevant knowledge or prior skills in delivering equalities or human rights advice. It questioned the appointment of G4S, which it said had \u201cearned a reputation for serious systemic mismanagement and discrimination\u201d and was responsible for human rights violations against those in its care. It highlighted concerns expressed by many MPs over the competence of the security company and included a dossier of serious allegations and findings against G4S.</p> <p>\u201cThese include systemic failings \u2026 the repeated findings of racism and sexism among G4S staff, and harrowing official reports of G4S mistreatment of children, pregnant women and other protected groups,\u201d the letter said.</p> <p>The company most recently came under renewed scrutiny over <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/05/moj-to-take-over-medway-child-jail-from-g4s\">its running of Medway youth jail</a>, which resulted in the government taking over the jail\u2019s management.</p> <p>The decision to award the contract to G4S has been criticised by union leaders, and a <a href=\"https://actions.sumofus.org/a/don-t-hand-the-government-s-discrimination-helpline-over-to-g4s\">petition by campaigning platform SumOfUs</a>, urging Justine Greening, the secretary of state for education, women and equalities not to give the contract to G4S but instead to give responsibility back to the EHRC, has received more than 53,000 signatures.</p> <p> Bella Sankey, director of policy at Liberty, said: \u201cThe EASS provides expert advice to those who face discrimination \u2013 whether refused accommodation because of their race, or sacked from their job because of their age. <br></p> <p>\u201cG4S has been responsible for countless human rights violations and the mistreatment \u2026 of people in their care. It\u2019s hard to think of a company more ill-equipped to provide this vital service. Liberty joins other equality and rights organisations in demanding that this perverse decision be halted while parliament investigates.\u201d</p> <p>Nimrod Ben-Cnaan, head of policy at the Law Centres Network, said: \u201cThis legal action is about ensuring access to justice for some of the most disadvantaged and often vulnerable people in society. It is already difficult for people to access appropriate advice on discrimination and human rights, which are complex areas of law. Our concern is that the government does all it should to ensure that the most suitable provider is chosen, and that the service is effective.\u201d</p> <p>Sondhya Gupta, senior campaigner with SomeOfUs.org, described the decision to award the contract to G4S as a \u201ckick in the teeth to everyone who faces disability, race, or sex discrimination\u201d. She added: \u201cWith hate crimes and discrimination on the rise in post-Brexit Britain, the kind of support that the EASS provides is now more important than ever.\u201d<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>A spokesman for the EHRC said: \u201cWe think the commission should have been given responsibility for running the service, and that remains our position. However, given that the contract has already been awarded, we are working with G4S and government to provide advice on how the service can best meet the needs of those who experience discrimination or an abuse of their human rights.\u201d</p> <p>Maria Miller said: \u201cWe are aware of the concerns that have been raised on this subject and will consider the matter carefully.\u201d </p> <p>A spokesperson for the government said: \u201cThe Equality Advisory and Support Service is an important source of free advice and support for people facing discrimination or human rights issues. To ensure the service can continue and is run as effectively and efficiently as possible, we ran an open and competitive tender process to identify who is best to take it forward. Following this, G4S has been successful, and it will be running the service for three years from October 2016.\u201d</p> <p>Neil Malpas, the managing director responsible at G4S for this service, said the company would bring experience gleaned from its work at the DWP helpline for separating parents. \u201cWe were awarded the contract on the strength of our work handling other complex call centres including the Department for Work and Pensions\u2019 (DWP) child maintenance options service,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have supported that helpline for separating parents over the past three years and feedback from callers and the DWP has been positive.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>Vitamin D pills can halve the risk of serious asthma attacks according to a major review of research into the impact the supplements have on the condition.</p> <p>People with mild or moderate asthma who took the vitamin with their normal medicine had fewer attacks that required hospital treatment than those who went without, scientists found.<br></p> <p>The risk of severe attacks fell from 6% to 3% in patients who had a vitamin D boost for six months to a year. The supplements cut the frequency of attacks too, with cases needing steroid treatment falling from one per person every two or so years, to one every four years.<br></p> <p>Half of all asthma patients will at some point have an attack that needs treating with oral steroids such as <a href=\"https://www.asthma.org.uk/advice/inhalers-medicines-treatments/steroids/\">prednisolone</a>, while a quarter will end up in hospital emergency departments. One in eight will have such serious attacks that they are admitted to hospital for further care.</p> <p>\u201cThere were some pretty striking positive findings,\u201d said Adrian Martineau, a professor of respiratory infection who led the review at Queen Mary, University of London. \u201cAsthma attacks cause 185 hospital admissions and three deaths each day in the UK, so this is a major problem for society.\u201d<br></p> <p>More than five million people in the UK, and 334 million globally, are affected by asthma which causes wheezing, coughing, tightness in the chest, and shortness of breath.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/aug/06/fevipiprant-asthma-drug-trial-treatment\">Asthma drug 'gamechanger' could revolutionise treatment</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The review for the <a href=\"http://www.cochranelibrary.com/\">Cochrane library</a> drew on results from seven published trials on 435 children, and a further two trials on 658 adults. Most of the patients had mild to moderate asthma, meaning they had symptoms at least two days a week, but their daily routine was not seriously affected. Nearly all kept taking their normal asthma medicine on top of the vitamin D supplements.<br></p> <p>While the trials found that a daily dose of 25 to 50 micrograms reduced the risk of serious attacks, the evidence was largely from adults. \u201cWe need more trials specifically focusing on children and also specifically focusing on adults with severe asthma to see if those patient groups could benefit,\u201d Martineau said.<br></p> <p>In July, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/aug/02/britain-not-sunny-enough-healthy-vitamin-d-levels-supplements\">Public Health England recommended</a> that everybody in Britain over the age of one consider taking a 10 microgram daily supplement of vitamin D, particularly over the autumn and winter when sunlight levels are low. The body makes vitamin D when sunlight falls on the skin, but people who cover up outside, and those who are housebound can struggle to make enough.<br></p> <p>It is not clear how vitamin D helps asthma patients, but supplements may work by boosting the immune system\u2019s defences against respiratory infections, such as the common cold, which are the main triggers for serious asthma attacks. The vitamin also seems to keep inflammation under control. <br></p> <p>\u201cYou can think of vitamin D almost as a designer drug because it has these two actions, the first being to boost immunity to infections and the second to dampen down inflammation,\u201d said Martineau.<br></p> <p>One question scientists hope to answer in the next few months is whether supplements only benefit asthma patients with low levels of vitamin D. \u201cAt the moment we just don\u2019t have the evidence to say who are those who are going to benefit and how low their vitamin D has to be in order to benefit,\u201d Martineau said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want people to stop taking their asthma medication and start taking vitamin D instead,\u201d he added.</p> <p>The findings come as scientists report impressive trial results for a drug that cuts asthma attacks in patients with the most severe form of the disease. Two trials in more than 2,500 people showed that a year\u2019s course of benralizumab injections reduced asthma attacks by a third to a half, according to <a href=\"http://www.thelancet.com/\">The Lancet</a>.<br></p> <p>Samantha Walker at Asthma UK said the new drug offered \u201cgenuine hope\u201d for people in the UK who had a type of asthma that does not respond to standard treatments. \u201cThese people struggle to breathe every day, restricting their ability to carry out everyday activities such as going to work or school and severely affecting their quality of life,\u201d she said. </p>",

Nor, a tad more importantly, is it the case with a small group of people in Finland, hailing \u2013 through their heritage \u2013 from Kosovo. The Balkan state will start their first-ever <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/world-cup-football\">World Cup</a> qualifying campaign this evening, but rather than spend the last few days in anticipation, it has been nothing but fret. After being granted admission to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/fifa\">Fifa</a> in May \u2013 with players of Kosovan birth or heritage who had represented other countries invited to apply for a nationality switch \u2013 there has been a long, laborious process of admin to get some of these players cleared to play tonight. The 3pm deadline today came and went with no updates and until a few moments ago, six of the squad were unaware if they had been declared eligible \u2013 hardly ideal circumstances for the manager Albert Bunjaki \u2013 but they have all been given the green light to play. Cue bedlam in Turku! It\u2019s as though they\u2019ve already won the World Cup!

We need such a vision if we are to persuade the electorate that we should stay in the EU.</p> <p>We also need to show that many of the genuine problems that troubled leave voters \u2013 stagnant wages, crowded schools and GP surgeries, not enough homes \u2013 are the fault of our government, not the EU.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>A significant number of leave voters need to change their minds</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>This is why I and some others who wished to remain have launched a new group, <a href=\"http://www.commongrounduk.com/\">CommonGround</a>, that promotes a broad vision for Britain, rather than simply wanting to stay in the EU. We have to find common ground with leave voters on the need for a fair and open society and for honest politics, which was in short supply on both sides of the referendum debate.</p> <p>Now, of course, even if some leave voters change their minds, the people may still not get a chance to vote on the Brexit terms. But let\u2019s peer into the crystal ball and consider a series of admittedly slim possibilities. The prime minister has craftily put<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/sep/05/david-davis-brexit-commons-statement-leaving-uk-since-brexit-vote-poll-suggests-politics-live\"> two Brexiteers \u2013 Davis and Liam Fox</a> \u2013 in charge of negotiating Brexit. If they come up with a terrible deal, she may be able to dissociate herself from it.</p> <p>Alternatively, Labour may get a new pro-European leader or a chunk of its MPs may split off and form their own party. Although Corbyn seems to have the leadership sewn up and most MPs are too scared to leave the mother ship now, things may change in the next couple of years. If so, enough pro-European Tories may join forces with Labour to require the government to hold a referendum on the Brexit deal.</p> <p>It\u2019s also possible that such a plebiscite is already legally required. Under the so-called <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-uk-leaves-the-eu-36749304\">referendum lock legislation</a> passed in 2011, the people have to authorise any treaty that replaces the existing EU treaties. A Brexit deal is likely to involve a new treaty. A clever lawyer could say this would replace the existing ones. If this argument holds water, we may have a new referendum whether May likes it or not.</p> <p>Finally, something may change in the EU that gives May a good excuse to consult the people again \u2013 either with a referendum or an election. In particular, if the EU was prepared to reform free movement, the prime minister might modify her mantra that Brexit means Brexit.</p> <p>Now, of course, the EU isn\u2019t remotely close to making such a change. But next year there is a French presidential election followed by a German general election. The far right is on the march pretty much everywhere, playing on people\u2019s fears over immigration. Germany\u2019s Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/04/mecklenburg-vorpommern-german-anti-immigrant-party-strong-regional-election-exit-polls-merkel\">beat Angela Merkel\u2019s party in a state election at the weekend</a>.</p> <p>The main concern across the Channel is over migration of large numbers of people from outside the EU, rather than freedom of movement of workers within the EU. But, as in the UK referendum, populist politicians may find it convenient to muddle the two issues. If so, mainstream politicians may respond by eventually agreeing to modify free movement.</p> <p>Listing these possibilities may seem like clutching at straws. Each scenario is a low-probability event. But they don\u2019t all have to occur for Britain to stay in the EU. If even one happens, that may be enough.</p> <p>What does have to happen is that a significant number of leave voters need to change their minds. That could in turn trigger one of the other possibilities \u2013 a U-turn by May, a change in the Labour party, or even the willingness of our European partners to offer Britain a concession to persuade us to stay.</p> <p>My own view is that the chance of staying in the EU is now no better than 25%. But no Brexit is a good Brexit except, just maybe, the pure fantasy one promised by the leave camp. Some things are worth fighting for even when the odds are long. This is one of them.</p>",

  "<p><a href=\"http://www.ohtony.com/\">Tony Edward</a>s, a long-term <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/burning-man-festival\">Burning Man</a> attendee, spent last Thursday observing his sixth wedding anniversary at the festival\u2019s temple. He was also returning the ashes of his late wife, <a href=\"http://projectradicalinclusion.com/author/laura/\">Laura Diamond</a>, to the place where they had exchanged their marital vows.</p> <p>A mother of four grown children, Laura \u2013 or Diamond Cutter as she was known at the festival \u2013 began coming to Burning Man in her 40s and met Tony there in 2009. She co-founded one of Burning Man\u2019s hundreds of theme camps, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/QueVivaCamp/\">Que Viva</a> \u2014 a racial and social justice camp.</p> <p>Laura cared deeply about diversity and expended a huge amount of effort to increase it. I had the honor of exchanging Facebook messages with her about these topics early last October. The following day, Tony and Laura were in a vehicle collision while riding a moped in Los Angeles, which left Tony injured and Laura dead. She was 54 years old.</p> <p>Tony moved in with a fellow burner as he mourned. And when the time came to decide what to do with his wife\u2019s ashes, Tony knew he would honor their promise \u201cthat if one of us went, we would take the other back to Burning Man\u201d. And so, at the beginning of last week, he placed Laura\u2019s ashes on an altar in Que Viva camp\u2019s dining tent; and on Thursday, led a procession to inter Laura at the Burning Man temple.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/sep/01/burning-man-2016-festival-guide\">How to survive 24 hours at Burning Man</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It is not unusual for people at Burning Man to memorialise their loved ones at the festival. Though it\u2019s perhaps much more known for all-night raves and some of the largest art installations in the world, Burning Man also sees people conduct the most meaningful ceremonies of life and death. Indeed, since its first temple was built by artist <a href=\"https://www.fest300.com/magazine/15-Years-of-Burning-Man-Temples-and-the-Story-of-David-Best\">David Best</a>, burners have flocked here to get married, as Tony and Laura did \u2013 and they\u2019ve also adorned the temple\u2019s walls with names, elaborate shrines and even the ashes of the deceased.</p> <p>Then, they remember their loved ones throughout the week, and watch on the last night of the festival as the temple is burned to the ground in silence.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"69e1f3afdea3ba5ba64a72743bee365712e50740\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/69e1f3afdea3ba5ba64a72743bee365712e50740/0_0_3500_2306/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Participants watch the Temple Project burn on Sunday night.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"659\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Participants watch the Temple Project burn on Sunday night.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jim Urquhart/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Building the temple</h2> <p>Death is rarely far from the minds of many people at Burning Man. The back of your ticket explicitly warns that \u201cyou hereby assume all risk of injury or death arising from the operation of art installations, theme camps or vehicles (including mutant vehicles or art cars)\u201d. It\u2019s not unusual for there to be a death in Black Rock City in any given year \u2013 just as a death happening in the course of a week in the life of any city of 70,000 people is nothing unusual.</p> <p>It was death by suicide which inspired artist Best to create Burning Man\u2019s first temple \u201caround the year 2000\u201d. \u201cI knew that if you\u2019re a Jew or a Catholic you couldn\u2019t be buried in a cemetery if you took your own life,\u201d Best told me. \u201cWhen I built the temple, my intention was to make it for someone who had taken their own life. Rather than being ashamed of that, you could celebrate and honor [the person who had died].\u201d</p> <p>That first year, Best thought 500 people would write names of dead loved ones on its walls, but \u201c10,000 people wrote names on it. It became a tradition.\u201d They didn\u2019t just write the names of people who took their own lives: \u201cThe next year, people came and brought pictures, ashes, combat boots. That was how it started.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e1654f467532a8c267a62a89f1cf3b3ee24b95ad\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e1654f467532a8c267a62a89f1cf3b3ee24b95ad/0_0_3500_2393/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Participants hug at the Temple Project.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"684\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Participants hug at the Temple Project.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jim Urquhart/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Best talks to me on a scorching hot afternoon a few days before the festival\u2019s gates open to the public. He is spraying a pungent vinegar finishing solution on to a portion of the massive multistory building about to be lifted by a crane, while a crew of about 100 volunteers work feverishly to open it as soon as possible. </p> <p>When they stop for lunch, Best says that mourning is different at Burning Man because \u201cthere\u2019s an understanding and an awareness that is different than the outside world. One year I saw a man in a tutu, with a tie-dyed Grateful Dead T-shirt on and a fluorescent orange wig weeping at the temple. He wouldn\u2019t have been allowed in a mortuary.\u201d</p> <p>The intensity of the festival also leads some to grieve. \u201cYou get your ass kicked, you\u2019re exhausted and your barriers are down. After a week you\u2019ve lost the keys to your RV, you\u2019re not packed, you\u2019ve drank too much, or your girlfriend or boyfriend has broken up with you. You\u2019ve got cracked feet walking on the playa. So you come to the temple and you\u2019re stripped. You\u2019re able to cry, you\u2019re able to reflect on some things.\u201d</p> <p>While we were eating, a member of the build crew brings a woman named Helen Hickman up to Best with a piece of wood which has been colorfully decorated with images and words about her mother.

I want you to carry the joy of that person in your life, for a moment.\u201d Best says he wants the crew to understand they are constructing a space where visitors could reflect on how their grief is \u201cwhat makes you beautiful. It\u2019s not ugly \u2013 it\u2019s tragic, but it\u2019s not ugly.\u201d</p> <p>Best regularly forgets the names of the people who work closest to him, but can recall the life stories strangers tell him about their deceased loved ones.

There are elaborate poster board displays of mothers and lovers alongside detailed photo essays and paintings. There are rainbow flags and Nepalese prayer flag, irreverent reactions to death (\u201cFuck meth!\u201d) and compassionate messages about those who took their own lives (\u201cit\u2019s not your fault\u201d).

A few of his campmates rode bicycles alongside the enormous two-story car decked out with feathers.</p> <p>The mood was both celebratory and somber. Tony and Laura had gotten married exactly six years before on this very car, next to the Burning Man temple. As it drove across the playa, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNC0kIzM1Fo\">Love is in the Air</a> played from its loudspeakers \u2013 a song also played on their wedding day. The car was swarmed by camp-mates on bicycles, like dolphins guiding a ship out to sea.</p> <p>As we rode towards his wife\u2019s final resting place, I asked Tony about how they\u2019d met. \u201cApparently, I\u2019m not good at picking up women, or the signals they are sending,\u201d he said. \u201cShe was across the street just watching me, and she said something like, \u2018Do I have to tell you come over here and talk to me?\u2019\u201d He smiled, holding her ashes.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f87b27231f0e79aa9110dc2ddb62393f0ecb70d7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f87b27231f0e79aa9110dc2ddb62393f0ecb70d7/0_0_3500_2440/1000.jpg\" alt=\"People gather at the Temple Project.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"697\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">People gather at the Temple Project.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jim Urquhart/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It was dusk when the cock car arrived at the temple, the nearby mountains rimmed with golden sunlight as the sky settled into gentle shades of pink and purple, and a warm breeze rose. By now, the volume of names adorning the temple was overwhelming. Tony and Favianna carefully placed Laura\u2019s ashes beneath her portrait, and also placed a number of her personal affects and more photos around her remains, surrounded by campers from Que Viva. Then Tony began to take some pictures of the pictures, as his photographer friend took photos of him taking them \u2013 a memory of a memory of a memory of the woman he loved.</p> <p>Tears trickled down his face as he began to speak. \u201cShe was my best friend and a wonderful mother to four great kids, and she graduated from UCLA last year.\u201d Burning Man had been \u201cthe spark that ignited her for the last years of her life, when she really just blossomed. She worked with many of you to make tickets to Burning Man available to artists of color.\u201d She had made a one-woman show about Burning Man at UCLA.</p> <p>Three weddings happened within earshot as people remembered Laura, punctuating our tears with cheers of celebration.</p> <p>\u201cWhen she left the house, we\u2019d say to each other, \u2018Kiss me in case I never see you again,\u2019\u201d Tony said near the end of the service. \u201cWe don\u2019t know how much time that we have. So love the ones you love and tell them you love them all the fucking time, and that way when they leave, you\u2019ll know you did your best.

  "<p>There are plenty of reasons why <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/05/no-10-theresa-may-rules-out-points-based-immigration-system-for-britain-brexit\" title=\"\">Theresa May\u2019s press conference in Hangzhou</a>, while perfectly competent in most ways, was not the most assured performance of her two-month premiership. She was, after all, attending her first top-level international summit with a group of more practised peers. She had arrived to find many of the G20 leaders in hostile and sceptical mood over Britain\u2019s Brexit vote. She was about to have a sticky encounter over nuclear power with China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping. She had not faced the British press since becoming prime minister. It would have taken someone with the rhinoceros hide of a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/keithvaz\" title=\"\">Keith Vaz</a> not to display a few nerves in such circumstances.</p> <p>Yet the main reason why Mrs May found herself on the back foot on Monday was wholly political not personal. On her way to China she had told the travelling press that the points-based immigration system promoted by the Vote Leave campaign during the EU referendum might not work. On Monday in Hangzhou, speaking from bitter experience from her time as home secretary, she amplified her sceptical view, saying that the trouble with points-based systems is that they take away migration control from governments by allowing people who meet the criteria to have automatic rights of entry.</p> <p>This stance was important for two reasons. First, it marked a clear break from the position adopted by the Vote Leave campaign, which had put a points-based system at the core of its immigration argument. This therefore puts Mrs May potentially at odds with Leavers in her own cabinet and party, including the trade secretary, Liam Fox, and Brexit secretary, David Davis, who campaigned for such a system. It also drew Nigel Farage back in front of the radio microphones and TV cameras \u2013 hasn\u2019t he retired to get his life back? \u2013 to accuse her of betraying Brexit voters.</p> <p>Second, it marked the conclusive arrival in the Brexit argument of a phrase that will soon start to haunt Mrs May unless and until she can deliver on it. The electorate voted to leave the EU, she said, because they wanted \u201csome control\u201d over migration from within the EU into the UK. Later, she varied it a little: \u201can element of control\u201d which could be delivered in \u201cvarious ways\u201d. Faraway in the House of Commons on Monday, Mr Davis, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/sep/05/david-davis-brexit-commons-statement-leaving-uk-since-brexit-vote-poll-suggests-politics-live\" title=\"\">in a generally anodyne statement on Brexit</a>, confirmed it yet again.</p> <p>If politics was a respectful process in which voters allowed a government the luxury of honing its positions on big issues over time, a phrase like this might not matter too much. Since politics does not work like that, however, and since immigration is a toxic issue, the phrase matters. By rejecting the points system Mrs May puts pressure on herself <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/05/uk-immigration-what-are-the-alternatives-to-a-point-based-system\" title=\"\">to define the alternative</a>. This will matter to Brexit voters, many of whom cast their votes because of immigration, real and imaginary. Their wish was for a lot of control, not some. And it will matter to pro-Brexit press campaigners, full of self-confidence now, who know weasel words when they hear them. They will press the issue until Mrs May reveals how much control is some.</p> <p>Mrs May has made her own luck this year, with spectacular rewards. She had another piece of luck on Monday, when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/sep/05/junior-doctors-suspend-planned-five-day-strike-in-september\" title=\"\">junior doctors called off the first of their new waves of industrial action</a>, in a dispute on which Mrs May has been unbending. But she will need to tell a lot of people very soon <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-37277412\" title=\"\">what she means by \u201csome control\u201d</a> if she is not to become a hostage to the ambiguity of the phrase. Mrs May said she would look at all forms of immigration, presumably including non-EU, before reaching a decision, while Mr Davis hinted that existing EU nationals in the UK would be able to stay. Nevertheless, a government that has staked its credibility on delivering Brexit, and that has put migration control at the top of its Brexit goals, is running a serious political risk if it does not come up pretty quickly with a solution that will satisfy its voters and activists.</p> <p>Important though it is, immigration is not the only issue here. Brexit is not a tactical issue. It is as large a strategic issue for the country as can be imagined in peacetime. As Mr Davis told MPs on Monday, even remain supporters have an interest in the government doing as good a job as circumstances permit. The increasing worry now, from both sides of the Brexit argument, is that Mrs May doesn\u2019t actually have a plan at all, and that she is pressing forward into the fog without a clear enough idea of her detailed goals. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing\u201d is a chant from the political terraces that would spell bad news for Mrs May.</p>",

Domestic economic policies pursued by the government will be much more important for the British economy than whether the country retains access to the single market.

  "<p>After two hours walking through the camp in Calais, meeting refugee children who have crossed Europe alone, Alf Dubs is exhausted and feeling uncharacteristically despondent. \u201cIt is awful. I will have nightmares, and this is just the tip of the iceberg,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Lord Dubs, the Labour peer who earlier this year masterminded a political coup forcing the government to promise to give sanctuary to some unaccompanied child refugees, usually comes across as an upbeat figure, not inclined to wallow in despair. Today he seems momentarily overwhelmed by the horrific situation facing about <a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/www.helprefugees.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/census-edit-kids.jpg\">860 children</a> living here in second-hand camping tents and flimsy wooden shacks. Given the amount of energy he has dedicated to trying to help them, and the complete absence of any progress to date, he has every reason to feel depressed.</p> <p>\u201cIt is a disgrace. A piece of legislation was passed with enormous public support, and the government has done nothing discernible about it,\u201d he says. As a former child refugee himself, brought to Britain from Czechoslovakia on one of the Kindertransport trains in 1939, his sense of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/27/peer-condemns-shocking-delays-over-help-for-unaccompanied-child-refugees\">anger at the political inaction</a> is particularly acute.</p> <p>After his intervention shamed Cameron\u2019s government into a U-turn, securing a commitment that Britain would give homes to some of the <a href=\"http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-europe-migrants-minors-idUKKCN0XT15M\">estimated 88,000 child refugees</a> believed to be travelling through Europe, his amendment to the Immigration Act was widely celebrated as a rare sign of the government\u2019s humanity. Four months later, none of the qualifying children have arrived in the UK. Worse still, Dubs is dismayed to find, during a meeting with French officials, that there is no system in place for identifying and registering the children in order to see who might be eligible.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dae2c72b36aaaf77636148356d3b1fdbc68c86e7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dae2c72b36aaaf77636148356d3b1fdbc68c86e7/0_394_5913_3548/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alf Dubs visits the Calais camp: \u2018No wonder they are so desperate to escape.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alf Dubs visits the Calais camp: \u2018No wonder they are so desperate to escape.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alecsandra Dragoi/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>His feelings of disappointment are nothing compared with those felt by the hundreds of children, some as young as eight, living here without parents or close relatives, many of whom have been stranded here, just a few hundred metres from Calais town centre and only 30 miles from England, since the end of last year.</p> <p>Ahead of his visit, volunteers ask some of the youngest children, potentially eligible for help under the \u201cDubs\u201d amendment, to meet him to help explain the urgency of the situation. Two cousins from Afghanistan, aged nine and 10, who left home more than a year ago and who have been in Calais for 10 months, were due to meet him. After months of trying to survive alone, attempting nightly to smuggle themselves into lorries to try to join an uncle in Britain, they are entirely crushed by their experiences and now mainly speak in reluctant monosyllables, occasionally offering a full sentence.</p> <p>The younger boy says (through a translator) that he had recently been hit on the knee with a rubber bullet fired by French police. His older cousin says they have tried more than 20 times in the past month to climb on to trucks. They look more unwell and more fragile than a month ago when I met them, their clothes grimier, and new scabs visible on the face of the younger boy.</p> <p>\u201cI lost my mind here. I don\u2019t remember anything I\u2019ve been doing,\u201d the older boy says. Pushed by the translator to say something else, he adds: \u201cWe ran away from war, and no one here has helped us ... Now the weather is getting colder.\u201d But he is not inclined to say much and tells the translator: \u201cThey ask too many questions, and they aren\u2019t doing anything.\u201d</p> <p>Another eight-year-old boy from Afghanistan, also left to fend for himself after the older relative he was travelling with succeeded in getting to England, is close to tears, and crouches on the sandy path, playing with stones and poking at the dirt with a stick. One of the volunteers who has worked with him says he feels suicidal.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Immigration minister James \u00adBrokenshire \u00adacknowledged: 'We have a moral duty to help'</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cThey need to leave the site now. They are on their own; they have been here through the winter and they are falling apart in front of us. There is no one here to put them to bed and sort their clothes. They are not functioning properly now. I can\u2019t believe that nobody in authority is here sorting this out. The British government has promised to help; the French aren\u2019t coping,\u201d says <a href=\"https://mydonate.bt.com/fundraisers/junglewomenscentre\">Liz Clegg</a>, a volunteer from Devon who has spent much of the past year living on the camp, trying to make up for the absence of support from mainstream international agencies.</p> <p>She and other volunteers have devoted a lot of energy to trying to persuade children to apply for asylum in the France, and hundreds already have, but sometimes children are resistant to logic persuasion when they know their parents have gone heavily into debt, trying to get them to the UK; often they are trying to reach relatives.</p> <p>Visits from groups of politicians are always emotionally fraught because the children expect help to be forthcoming immediately, and find it hard to understand why nothing is done, Clegg says. She decides that these children are not up to speaking to Dubs, who is visiting alongside Vanessa Redgrave and her daughter Joely Richardson, and the Walthamstow MP Stella Creasy.</p> <p>Instead, Dubs has a private meeting in a wooden hut with three boys from Eritrea, aged between 13 and 16, who <a href=\"http://www.citizensuk.org/\">Citizens UK</a>, the campaign group which has been lobbying for Britain to help unaccompanied children, believe have a good case for being transferred to safety in Britain. Their names, along with those of the cousins from Afghanistan, were on a <a href=\"www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/02/home-secretary-urged-to-act-over-refugee-children-stuck-in-calais\">list of 387 refugee children</a> believed to be eligible under the amendment presented by Dubs to the Home Office on Friday.</p> <p>He leaves the meeting aware they need help urgently. \u201cI felt a terrible sense of hopeless despair on their behalf. They are clearly frightened of violence from older people; they don\u2019t feel safe,\u201d he says. Outside the hut, crowds of people gather to find out what help is on offer. \u201cThis boy is 14, what about him?\u201d one older camp residents shouts. \u201cCan you meet my friend who is 12?\u201d another asks.</p> <p>The problem facing campaigners such as Dubs is immense, and he acknowledges that it is a struggle not to feel overcome by the weight of responsibility.</p> <p>Fleetingly in May, it appeared that, regardless of political sensitivities around immigration, there was a consensus that something needed to done for the lone child refugees. With Save The Children estimating that there were 85,000 across Europe, politicians acknowledged that Britain had a responsibility to take its share of stranded children.</p> <p>Originally, the government rejected Dubs\u2019s amendment on the grounds that France, Greece and Italy are safe countries, until Dubs argued that there was a responsibility to share the burden between countries. The then immigration minister, James Brokenshire, acknowledged: \u201cWe have a moral duty to help.\u201d Even the <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-3562690/DAILY-MAIL-COMMENT-Mail-s-robust-migration-lost-children-sanctuary.html\">Daily Mail launched a campaign</a> to help the children.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8566845e90a6a88a48107558cbd9445a4ab15ea7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8566845e90a6a88a48107558cbd9445a4ab15ea7/0_0_6016_4016/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A nine-year-old boy in the Calais camp.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"668\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A nine-year-old boy in the Calais camp.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alecsandra Raluca Dragoi/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The impetus got lost in the Brexit referendum, amid a hardening of attitudes on immigration. Local authorities with stretched budgets have yet to offer enough spaces to accommodate more asylum-seeking children. The situation in Calais is volatile and complex, and there is no simple solution. With the camp population now more than 9,000 and rising \u2013 higher than it has ever been \u2013 alarm among local people is mounting. The roads around the town this week are being <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/05/travel-chaos-warning-as-french-farmers-and-truckers-plan-calais-camp-protest\">blockaded by French farmers</a>, truck drivers and residents, demanding that the government set a firm date for the camp to be cleared. The French government has said it will be gone by Christmas, but plans for the refugees are not clear. Attempts by some migrants to block the road at night and storm on to lorries have become <a href=\"[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3772571/Carnage-Calais-Horrific-crash-jungle-migrant-gangs-target-tourists-cars-MoS-journalists-badly-hurt-terrifying-new-ambush-technique.html\">more violent and more frequent</a>, making the area dangerous for lorry drivers.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It\u2019s not surprising they are doing \u00adeverything to cross the Channel.

But somehow the numbers are rising. Volunteers attempting to register the new unaccompanied children arriving in Calais note that numbers have jumped by about 100 in the past month, with more children coming from Eritrea, Ethiopia and Iraq, and greater numbers of unaccompanied girls.</p> <p>New reports documenting the dangers of the camp are published every week; on Monday <a href=\"http://www.unicef.org.uk/Media-centre/Press-releases/Children-risking-their-lives-over-2000-times-a-week-to-reach-the-UK/\">Unicef research</a> suggested that the Calais refugee children were risking their lives 2,000 times a week to reach Britain, trying to stow away in lorries or jump on trains.</p> <p>The Home Office says it is in \u201cactive discussions\u201d with the UNHCR and Italian, Greek and French governments to \u201cspeed up mechanisms to identify, assess and transfer refugee children to the UK where this is in their best interests.\u201d But no children have come as a result of the Dubs commitment.</p> <p>\u201cI was shocked that nothing had happened despite the amendment. There are more people than ever, and the conditions are as awful as ever \u2013 children living in shacks, in tents very makeshift, with just one meal a day, often not enough to eat, with no support system except for the volunteers, left to their own devices,\u201d Dubs says.</p> <p>\u201cVisually, it is pretty awful, hemmed in, with barbed wire along the motorway; what it will be like in the cold and winter, I shudder to think. Human beings can\u2019t survive indefinitely like this. No wonder there is violence in the camp, no wonder they are so desperate to escape.

Like the children in Calais, he had very little with him, a few clothes and a knapsack of food, (which he forgot to open on the journey \u2013 a sign, he thinks, of how traumatised he was).</p> <p>He only remembers the journey hazily. \u201cMy mother saw me off. I can see my mother with a friend at the station and a soldier with a swastika on the platform. When we got to the Dutch border, the older ones cheered. I had no idea, but they knew it meant something.\u201d Later, he remembers waiting at Liverpool Street station with a name tag around his neck, until his father (who had fled Prague a few months earlier) was allowed to take him back to a bed and breakfast where his father was staying in Belsize Park, north London.</p> <p>\u201cThere is a temptation to make up what you thought at the age of six; actually you don\u2019t remember much. I didn\u2019t know what was happening; I couldn\u2019t understand. I don\u2019t want to pretend I had a sensitivity or wisdom that I didn\u2019t have,\u201d he says. Nevertheless, he believes his experience has given him some understanding of how the unaccompanied children in Calais are feeling. \u201cSome of them were helped to flee by their parents or by traffickers, because they feared death, war, bombings \u2013 not totally different motivations from mine. I see them, and I see think there but for the grace of God ...\u201d</p> <p>He takes some inspiration from Winton\u2019s campaign. \u201cIt was a matter of luck that he was persuaded to give up a skiing holiday to go to Prague and he saw for himself what was happening. He set about working extremely hard to overcome the resistance of the British government and the suspicion of the Germans.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>This is not a place for living. The human is not created to live like this</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In some ways, it might have been easier for Winton, because \u201cimmigration wasn\u2019t the political issue on which the administration had staked its reputation\u201d, Dubs says. \u201cBut he took on the British authorities almost single-handedly and got them to agree. He was an exceptional individual who made things happen when a lesser person would not have bothered.\u201d</p> <p>Winton\u2019s MP was Theresa May, and Dubs met her first at his 103rd birthday party. While May was home secretary, he met her twice to talk about his amendment; the second time, under considerable political pressure, she agreed to include it in the immigration bill. He is uncertain about the strength of her ongoing commitment to the issue.</p> <p>In a wooden hut, set up by volunteers as a safe meeting space for the children travelling alone, a couple of dozen boys, mostly in their early teens, are waiting for food, half-watching a Bollywood film involving a flying taxi; some are curious about the visit from British politicians.</p> <p>Among them is 13-year-old Jawaad (not his real name) from Afghanistan, who learned English from his father, a Nato translator who has been pursued by the Taliban for working with western forces, and who has separately fled the country. \u201cIs it true that the government will pick up the right boys and take them legally?\u201d he asks, in careful, grammatically correct English.</p> <p>He says he his too tired and frightened to continue attempting to travel to the UK illegally. \u201cEvery second you are scared that something dangerous will happen to you. The French police, they are familiar with beating. When the police started beating dangerously, a lot of the underage boys stopped trying to go illegally. They don\u2019t care if you are a child or a grownup. They send dogs after us. The dog\u2019s mouth is covered but they can get you with their nails.\u201d</p> <p>He is clear about why Calais is not a suitable place for children travelling alone. \u201cFrom the time I arrived in Calais, I don\u2019t have a happy moment.

Calais is full of dangers and difficulties. When we want to take a shower, we cannot. We have no money for anything. When we want to call our parents, we are not able to. We have no relatives here.</p> <p>\u201cThis is not a place for living. The human is not created to live like this. In my room in Afghanistan, I had electricity, I could study night and day. I had a beautiful bed, I slept comfortably. Here I have a tent. I have only a blanket, and the clothes I am sleeping in. When it is raining heavily sometimes the water comes inside the tent. Sometimes when you are late for the food, you will be hungry. At home, I never lived like this. It is too strange.\u201d</p> <p>Returning home would be extremely dangerous. \u201cI don\u2019t want to go to back to Afghanistan. I couldn\u2019t be alive for a moment back there. The Taliban forced my father to leave his job. I don\u2019t know where he is now.\u201d</p> <p>Volunteers who have been trying to help the children, struggling without the support of international aid agencies, are jaundiced by the lack of progress on the \u201cDubs\u201d amendment. \u201cI\u2019d love to say I was surprised,\u201d says Karen Moynihan, who works with children in a youth centre on the camp. \u201cThere have been lots of politicians with good intentions, but, on the ground, very little has changed.\u201d</p> <p>Volunteers are becoming used to seeing children with cuts to their heads from falling off lorries, or complaining of having been sprayed in the face with pepper spray, she says. \u201cNow we just say: \u2018Are you OK?\u2019 It has become normalised. These are, without doubt, the most appalling conditions for young children to be living in.\u201d</p> <p>Dubs leaves the camp determined to keep fighting to ensure that at least some of the children are helped. \u201cThese kids are having a terrible time. There\u2019s no safety, no security. The situation we saw today is terrible.

The Prevent strategy has never conflated religious practice with radicalisation. Indeed, we are clear there is no single path to radicalisation, just as there is no single red flag that identifies it. In fact, Prevent\u2019s multi-agency approach recognises that factors such as mental health, substance abuse and social circumstances are crucial factors. What is more, Prevent also deals with far-right extremism. Of course, this is difficult and challenging work, but the kind of grassroots education that Professor Ramadan calls for is already happening around the country. Civil society groups supported by Prevent ran 130 projects last year, reaching more than 25,000 people and countering radicalisation in numerous communities. For example, one such group \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.kikitproject.org/\">Kikit Pathways</a> in Birmingham \u2013 succeeded in stopping two young men from travelling to Syria, even though they had tickets booked. We work with many other community groups, and mosques around the country, and more recently the NSPCC.</p> <p>The UK is leading the world in preventing people being drawn into terrorism and many countries are starting to copy our approach. Irresponsibly fuelling the myths around Prevent makes this vital work harder and inadvertently helps those who seek to radicalise young minds. It is misleading and dangerous.<br><strong>Ben Wallace MP</strong><br><em>Security minister</em></p> <p>\u2022 Tariq Ramadan claims that by focusing on security, surveillance and criminalisation, counter-terrorism in Europe and the US targets all Muslims, and not just violent extremists, when a genuine partnership is needed instead. These are familiar yet unconvincing claims. What those who take this view consistently fail to explain is how such cooperation can be established when every official overture in this direction is so vehemently and noisily denounced as merely another exercise in securitisation, surveillance and criminalisation. The voices of Muslims and others who understand that partnership must go hand-in-hand with securitisation need to be heard more clearly above the uproar of denunciation created by those who don\u2019t.<br><strong>Professor Steven Greer</strong> <em>Professor of human rights, University of Bristol Law School, </em><strong>Dr Lindsey Bell</strong> <em>Lecturer in law, Royal Holloway, University of London</em></p> <p>\u2022 Although Tariq Ramadan helpfully draws attention to the fact that political as well as religious issues play a part in the radicalisation of young people, he at one point suggests that jihadis \u201cmust be seen more as propaganda victims than as consciously responsible for their actions, however extreme\u201d. This is problematic. For example, regardless of what propaganda he may have been fed, a man in Nice made a conscious decision to drive a truck into a huge crowd on Bastille Day. He intentionally killed many innocent people. The people Ramadan is talking about are autonomous moral agents, old enough to be held accountable for their actions, not passive vessels for extremist propaganda with no control over their moral choices. Framing terrorists as victims and suggesting that they are not consciously responsible for their actions is unhelpful and deeply disrespectful of the victims of the atrocities that they commit.<br><strong>Christian Goulart Mc Nerney</strong><br><em>St Hilda\u2019s College, Oxford</em></p> <p>\u2022 It is tragic that the US and Russia have failed to agree on strategy for fighting Isis in Syria (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/04/syria-peace-talks-us-and-russia-stall-g20\">Report</a>, 5 September).

There was a furious row over bonuses a couple of years ago when the board had to have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/jul/02/sports-direct-meeting-mike-ashley\">four attempts to push through a scheme for Ashley</a>. </p> <p>Then there was Hellawell\u2019s ineffectual appearance in front of the Scottish affairs select committee; <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/mar/25/sports-direct-backstreet-outfit-mps-parliamentary-inquiry\">MPs were astonished</a> by his lack of knowledge about the collapse of a subsidiary. Or try Hellawell\u2019s baffling tolerance for Sports Direct being run without a permanent finance director for the past two and a half years; Matt Pearson <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jun/04/sports-direct-chief-financial-officer-matt-pearson-mike-ashley-power\">has been \u201cacting\u201d chief financial officer since June last year</a>.</p> <p>This year\u2019s kerfuffle put the others in the shade, of course: the HMRC investigation that followed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/09/how-sports-direct-effectively-pays-below-minimum-wage-pay\">this newspaper\u2019s investigation</a> into working practices at the company\u2019s Shirebrook distribution warehouse. Ashley, as well as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jun/07/mike-ashley-admits-sports-direct-staff-were-not-paid-minimum-wage\">admitting</a> to parliament that Sports Direct had broken the law by paying some workers less than the minimum wage, conceded that the company \u201cprobably\u201d outgrew his ability to manage it \u201ca long time ago.\u201d Shouldn\u2019t a responsible chairman have noticed?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/05/from-sutcliffe-to-drugs-policy-the-career-of-keith-hellawell\">From Peter Sutcliffe to drugs policy: the career of Keith Hellawell</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Outside shareholders would also expect an effective chairman to have told them more about the odd arrangement whereby Sports Direct pays a company <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/22/sports-direct-pays-mike-ashleys-older-brother-international-delivery\">owned by Ashley\u2019s brother to deliver online orders outside the UK</a>. Again, that disclosure came via the press.</p> <p>Add it all up and this year\u2019s rebellion against Hellawell\u2019s stewardship is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/05/sports-direct-braces-for-investor-revolt-against-management-at-agm\">likely to be heavier than usual</a>. Hermes, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/25/sports-direct-corporate-governance-criticised-investor-forum\">Legal &amp; General, Aberdeen Asset Management </a>and Royal London are all thought to be the \u201coppose\u201d camp. New rules mean Ashley cannot vote his 55% stake so it is possible that Hellawell\u2019s re-election could be defeated on Wednesday.</p> <p>If so, Sports Direct and Hellawell will have two options. The first is to say \u201cup yours\u201d and call a second poll, in which Ashley would be allowed to vote, and force through the appointment anyway. The second is to conclude that the game is up, and that a new chairman is overdue.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/05/from-sutcliffe-to-drugs-policy-the-career-of-keith-hellawell\">Former policeman Hellawell is not a chap noted for taking a step backwards</a> but even he should be able to see where Sports Direct\u2019s own interest lies. The shares have plunged 60% since last summer, shareholders aren\u2019t getting a dividend and the fabled bonus scheme isn\u2019t even paying out for full-time staff. Bloody-mindedness isn\u2019t working. It\u2019s time to go.</p> <h2>Another JP Morgan bloke for Barclays\u2019 executive committee</h2> <p>Chief executive Jes Staley\u2019s latest senior recruit to Barclays is Tim Throsby, who will head the corporate and investment bank. He comes from JP Morgan. They usually do.</p> <p>Staley has made five appointments to his executive committee since becoming boss last year. Two have been internal promotions and three have been hires from JP Morgan, his old shop. Another former Morganite, finance director Tushar Morzaria, was already in place when Staley arrived. So the ex-JPM tally now reads five out of nine members of the executive committee, including Staley himself. It\u2019s been a quiet takeover \u2013 though not necessarily one that will upset shareholders.</p> <p>But the lack of diversity is striking in another regard: where once there were two women on Barclays\u2019 executive committee, now there are none. \u201cWe want to see more women represented in senior roles,\u201d runs the bank\u2019s standard blurb. Easy to say; easier in practice, it seems, to get a bloke from JP Morgan.</p> <h2>Corporate types take note: May might have meant it</h2> <p>Still on boardroom governance, half the corporate world seems to have convinced itself that Theresa May didn\u2019t really mean it when she made that fierce speech in her leadership campaign about \u201cdoing something radical,\u201d like putting employees and consumers on boards.</p> <p>Corporate lobbyists have spent subsequent weeks suggesting ways in which the prime minister could water down her ideas with minimum political fuss. Instead of elected representatives on boards, how about allocating the role to a regular non-executive director?, runs one feeble compromise.</p> <p>What if May meant every word? \u201cWe\u2019ll be bringing out some proposals later in the year,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/05/theresa-may-tells-g20-she-plans-to-tackle-bad-corporate-behaviour\">said May when asked about corporate taxes and responsibility at the G20 summit</a>. That commits her to nothing, but corporate types should take note: there\u2019s no hint of back-sliding yet.</p>",
  "<p>Juan Mart\u00edn del Potro, in his quiet and ambling fashion, has built up a steady body of work on his return to the tournament he won in 2009, and, with the crowd warming to every pistol crack of his huge forehand, he enters the quarter-finals on Wednesday as a dangerous contender.</p> <p>As with Andy Murray, the scene of his breakthrough major will always hold a special place in his heart, and the Argentinian seemed energised against the Austrian Dominic Thiem, who quit after only an hour and 12 minutes of their match on Arthur Ashe Court with a knee injury, when 6-3 and 3-2 down.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2009/sep/15/juan-martin-del-potro-us-open\">Juan Mart\u00edn del Potro shocks Roger Federer to win US Open title</a> </p> </aside>  <p>That took Del Potro\u2019s total court time in four matches to eight hours and 21 minutes, blessed relief for a player who is still picking up the rhythm of the Tour after missing so much tennis with a lingering wrist injury over the past two years. He played only four matches last year, to Thiem\u2019s 64, and 10 the year before compared with Thiem\u2019s 45. This is Del Potro\u2019s his first grand slam quarter-final since Wimbledon 2013. He faces Stan Wawrinka, who later beat Illya Marchenko in four sets.</p> <p>\u201cIt is a good win. I wish all the best to Dominic. He has great future,\u201d the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/15/andy-murray-beats-juan-martin-del-potro-rio-2016\" title=\"\">unseeded Olympic silver medallist </a>said. \u201cI really don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on but I have a good connection with the people of New York City. I am far away in Argentina but I feel at home here, in this stadium, in this city. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m playing better than in 2009, but I keep winning.\u201d</p> <p>The Argentinian\u2019s absence \u2013 he missed nine successive grand slam events \u2013 has sent his ranking south and, at 142 in the world, he is the lowest-rated to reach the quarter-finals since Jimmy Connors (174) 25 years ago. The American went on to lose in the semi-finals. There was a certain irony in Thiem\u2019s retirement: the 23-year-old\u2019s 69 matches for the year is the most of any player on the Tour, more than twice Del Potro\u2019s 30. Managing resources is a skill in itself and the former US champion looks as if he has mastered it. Despite his injury woes, it was clear who was the most weary on court on Monday afternoon.</p> <p>Thiem called for the trainer after struggling through the latter part of the first set and the early stages of the second. It was not a great surprise when he became the ninth player to retire during a match in the final grand slam of the season, which invariably has a high casualty rate. Although Del Potro hit only 10 clean winners in the shortened contest, they were invariably eye-catching and gave his opponent no chance of keeping the ball in play. He served efficiently, was lethal at the net, took all three break opportunities and hit a mere 10 unforced errors.Elsewhere, Kei Nishikori booked his place in the last eight with a straight sets victory over Ivo Karlovic in the last match to be held on Louis Armstrong before it is rebuilt. The Japanese was always in control against the big-serving Croat but needed a tie-break to seal the third set.</p>",

He replied:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Access to the single market is not really up for grabs. It is there for everybody. There are many, many countries, many countries outside the European Union, that do a better job, frankly, of exporting to the single market than we do, even without a trade arrangement. So of course we want to have access to the single market. We don\u2019t need to be a member of it to do it. Indeed, being a member of it has caused some of the problems of sovereignty that this referendum was driven by.</p> </blockquote> <p>Later, when the pro-European Tory<strong> Anna Soubry</strong> asked Davis to confirm that he was willing to abandon single market membership, Davis replied:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>What I\u2019m saying is that this government is looking at every option. But the simple truth is that if a requirement of membership is giving up control of our borders, I think that makes it very improbable.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>Davis said he did not accept the claim that there was a trade off between getting control of immigration and protecting free trade by remaining in the single market.</strong> It was a false choice, he argued, because it was in the interests of both sides to promote free trade. (See<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/sep/05/david-davis-brexit-commons-statement-leaving-uk-since-brexit-vote-poll-suggests-politics-live?page=with:block-57cd9281e4b01f3b27891895#block-57cd9281e4b01f3b27891895\"> 4.46pm.)</a></li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>He said the government\u2019s post-Brexit immigration system would be \u201cmore rigorous\u201d than a points-based system. </strong>He said Theresa May was \u201cvery clear\u201d in her comments in China earlier.</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>She was concerned that a points-based system was too open-ended, that it did not actually put a control on the number of people coming to the UK. And therefore she wanted something which sounded like it would be more rigorous not less.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He said he would oppose any attempt to undermine workers\u2019 rights as part of the Brexit settlement.</strong> He said this in response to a question from Labour\u2019s<strong> Angela Eagle</strong> (see <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/sep/05/david-davis-brexit-commons-statement-leaving-uk-since-brexit-vote-poll-suggests-politics-live?page=with:block-57cd9736e4b01f3b278918ba#block-57cd9736e4b01f3b278918ba\">5.05pm)</a> using language very similar to that he used<a href=\"http://www.conservativehome.com/platform/2016/07/david-davis-trade-deals-tax-cuts-and-taking-time-before-triggering-article-50-a-brexit-economic-strategy-for-britain.html\"> in his ConservativeHome article in July. </a>In that article he said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The great British industrial working classes voted overwhelmingly for Brexit. I am not at all attracted by the idea of rewarding them by cutting their rights. </p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He said the government would have to decide whether or not it wanted to remain part of the European customs union before invoking article 50, starting the formal EU withdrawal process. </strong>(See<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/sep/05/david-davis-brexit-commons-statement-leaving-uk-since-brexit-vote-poll-suggests-politics-live?page=with:block-57cd9a6ee4b01f3b278918c7#block-57cd9a6ee4b01f3b278918c7\"> 5.20pm.)</a></li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>He refused to say whether the UK would remain part of Europol.</strong> Labour\u2019s Yvette Cooper asked this. Davis said the government wanted to preserve the relationship with the EU on security matters as best we can. He went on: \u201cOf course we are aiming to maintain that. And that\u2019s the answer.\u201d But he seemed to be making a general point, not answering the specific question about Europol. That is how Cooper interpreted his answer.</li> </ul>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/YvetteCooperMP/status/772827185128280064\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Asked if Gov had made decision on whether we shd stay in Europol (fundamental for fighting crime &amp; trafficking).

I will probably be writing that sentence again after David Davis\u2019s Commons statement, and probably quite regularly for the rest of the decade. In truth May and her team may have little idea what the final Brexit settlement will look like and, as they try to craft a deal acceptable to both Nigel Farage, the CBI and the EU, the outcome is likely to emerge slowly and haphazardly. (That\u2019s why <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jasongroves1/status/745278844135931904\">David Cameron once said a Brexit vote would mean \u201cthree years of Euro-wank.)</a></p> <p> But some of May\u2019s comments were moderately revealing. Here are the key points.</p> <ul> <li><strong>May said that leaving the EU would give the UK \u201csome control\u201d over EU migration - suggesting that the restrictions on EU migration might just be partial.</strong> She said that at present the UK could not restrict EU migration. She went on:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>What we will now have an ability to do, which we haven\u2019t had before, is when we come out of the EU, we will be able to have some control on movement of people coming from the EU into the UK, which of course was one element over which we weren\u2019t able to have control before. </p> </blockquote> <p>It is not entirely clear what May meant, but hardline anti-Europeans like Nigel Farage (see <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/sep/05/david-davis-brexit-commons-statement-leaving-uk-since-brexit-vote-poll-suggests-politics-live?page=with:block-57cd2b09e4b01f3b278917b0#block-57cd2b09e4b01f3b278917b0\">9.33am)</a> are likely to be worried by her tone. My colleague <strong>Alan Travis </strong>says this could be a hint that free movement could remain for EU citizens with job offers in the UK.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/alantravis40/status/772767292937625600\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">May says she wants to &quot;gain an element of control&quot; over immigration.

She explained her point with a story about what she learnt when she visited Heathrow to speak to Border Force staff with David Cameron after they took office.</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>And we talked to Border Force officers there. And we said to them, \u2018What\u2019s the most important thing that we can focus on?\u2019 And they said, \u2018You need to look at the issue of students who come here, who appear to have met the criteria, they don\u2019t speak English, they don\u2019t know which institution they are going to and they don\u2019t know what course it is they\u2019re doing\u2019.

This is what May actually said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>You really don\u2019t want to ask a former home secretary about the intricacies of a points-based system because it might take a very long time to answer your question. One of the issues is whether or not points-based systems do work.</p> </blockquote> <p>May said what people wanted was \u201can ability to be able to control the movement of people from the European Union ... not free movement as it has been in the past.\u201d She left reporters with the impression that EU citizens could still take priority over non-EU citizens under the immigration rules that will eventually be adopted post-Brexit.</p> <p><strong>Nigel Farage,</strong> the outgoing Ukip leader, has responded this morning by issuing a statement criticising May\u2019s stance. He said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Theresa May\u2019s track record on immigration as Home Secretary was appalling and her comments rejecting an Australian-style points system really worry me. There is already huge anxiety out there in the country regarding Theresa May\u2019s reluctance to trigger article 50. Her rejection of the type of migration system so many went out there and voted Leave to see implemented indicates serious backsliding. </p> <p>The people were clear in wanting a points-based immigration system which is why so many went out and voted to Leave the European Union. Any watering down from that will lead to real anger.</p> </blockquote> <p>Farage also said it would be \u201ctotally unacceptable\u201d to give EU citizens priority under the post-Brexit immigration rules.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Given that myself and others also campaigned for a migration system that would treat all who wanted to come equally, any preference for EU nationals would be totally unacceptable.

We\u2019ve been told that Brexit means Brexit, but beyond that relatively little has been said about what Brexit will entail and Davis\u2019s statement may enlighten us (but probably only marginally - don\u2019t expect the full negotiating prospectus). In a statement released overnight Davis stressed that Britain\u2019s future outside the EU would be marvellous.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Brexit isn\u2019t about making the best of a bad job. It is about seizing the huge and exciting opportunities that will flow from a new place for Britain in the world. There will be new freedoms, new opportunities, new horizons for this great country.</p> </blockquote> <p>But hang on. On her flight to the G20 summit in China, in a briefing with journalists, <strong>Theresa May</strong> gave a rather more sober assessment of Britain\u2019s prospects. She told the hacks:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Now I\u2019m not going to pretend it will be plain sailing. There\u2019ll be some difficult times ahead.</p> </blockquote> <p>Like the cabinet, the public at large also seems uncertain about the implications of Brexit. The BBC is focusing on Brexit today and it has released a poll showing that, while 62% of people are positive about Britain\u2019s future after the EU referendum, 35% are negative.

  "<p>One of the leading test cases retried under revised \u201cjoint enterprise\u201d rules has resulted in a man being acquitted of murder.</p> <p>Ameen Jogee, 27, was, however, convicted at Nottingham crown court of the manslaughter of former police officer Paul Fyfe in Leicester in June 2011.</p> <p>The verdict represents a significant development for the grassroots organisation Joint Enterprise Not Guilty By Association (Jengba), which led the campaign to overturn convictions and secured the support of the House of Commons justice select committee, the playwright Jimmy McGovern and senior lawyers.</p> <p> Jogee, who has already served five years in prison, had originally been found guilty of murder and sentenced to 20 years in jail. He will be sentenced for the manslaughter conviction on 12 September. <br></p> <p>The controversial criminal law doctrine permits two or more defendants to be convicted of the same offence, even where they had different levels of involvement. Critics have accused police and prosecutors of using it as a \u201cdragnet\u201d to target young people \u2013 often from black, Asian and minority ethnic backgrounds.</p> <p>This year, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2016/feb/18/joint-enterprise-law-wrongly-interpreted-for-30-years-court-rules\">the supreme court ruled that for the past 30 years judges had been misinterpreting a key justification for obtaining convictions</a>, confusing the fact that an outcome might be foreseeable with criminal intent.</p> <p>The court of appeal has begun considering a number of test challenges that could have implications for hundreds of prisoners convicted under joint enterprise rules.</p> <p>In the case of Jogee, a retrial was ordered. On Friday, the jury in Nottingham returned a not guilty verdict to murder after more than 13 hours of deliberations. They returned the manslaughter verdict on Monday.</p> <p>Jogee was charged with murder and the alternative charge of manslaughter over the death of Fyfe, a 47-year-old father of three, who was stabbed at the home of his girlfriend.</p> <p>During a two-week retrial, the jury heard that Mohammed Hirsi, then 25, delivered the fatal blow to Fyfe\u2019s heart. The prosecution alleged Jogee \u201cegged on\u201d Hirsi while standing on the doorstep of the property. Jogee denied both counts.</p> <p>During the trial, William Harbage QC, prosecuting, told the jury it was accepted that Hirsi \u201cwielded\u201d the knife but added: \u201cThis trial concerns the part played by this defendant and his criminal responsibility.\u201d</p> <p>Felicity Gerry QC, defending, said Fyfe\u2019s death had been a surprise to Jogee, adding: \u201c[He] is not a murderer. He was just in the wrong place at the wrong time.\u201d</p> <p> Gloria Morrison, one of the leading activists in Jengba, said: \u201cIt\u2019s a significant victory. If the supreme court had not made the decision it did, he would still be in prison for murder. It means others can appeal to have their sentences reduced. It\u2019s really important that he will not be a convicted murderer now. His mother was in tears on Friday.\u201d </p> <p>Morrison said she was disappointed by the manslaughter conviction because she believed Jogee had been trying to persuade Hirsi to leave the house, not stab Fyfe.</p> <p>Speaking after the verdict, the chief crown prosecutor for the East Midlands, Janine Smith, said she was \u201csatisfied\u201d justice has been done. She added: \u201cAmeen Jogee actively encouraged Mohammed Hirsi in the violent assault against their victim. Although Mohammed Hirsi was responsible for inflicting the fatal injury that killed a former police officer, both were responsible for his death. The appalling nature of this crime has not lessened with time and we are satisfied justice has been done in this case.\u201d </p> <p>DI David Swift-Rollinson, the senior investigating officer in the case, said: \u201cToday\u2019s result is the culmination of a lengthy legal process following Paul\u2019s death five years ago.</p> <p>\u201cWhile we are satisfied with the verdict that has been reached, this further trial has delayed the closure which Paul\u2019s family and relatives have been seeking.\u201d</p>",

He is also, by some distance, the most interesting. Listening to his bland statement on Brexit to MPs this afternoon, though, you would never have guessed it.</p> <p>Davis, head of the new department of Brexit, yields nothing to either Liam Fox or Boris Johnson in self-esteem. Yet Davis is a deeper and more nuanced political figure than the other two. As a working-class small-state libertarian for whom cabinet office has come late (he is 67), his reputation, which took a huge hit after he lost the Tory leadership to David Cameron in 2005, now stands or falls on what he achieves on the most important subject in British politics.</p> <p>Davis\u2019s statement today gave nothing away. Everything that he said had already been said by May in her interview at the weekend with Andrew Marr, in her <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/sep/05/david-davis-brexit-commons-statement-leaving-uk-since-brexit-vote-poll-suggests-politics-live?page=with:block-57cd5e8de4b0c2a396c06dd3#block-57cd5e8de4b0c2a396c06dd3\" title=\"\">Hangzhou press conference</a> or elsewhere. Indeed the only new fact in his statement was to confirm that it would be May, not Davis, Fox or Johnson, who would lead the Brexit negotiations. The idea that the Brexiteers would formally set the agenda for the Brexit talks seems dead, if indeed it ever existed.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/sep/05/david-davis-brexit-commons-statement-leaving-uk-since-brexit-vote-poll-suggests-politics-live\">David Davis - backed by Boris Johnson and Liam Fox - sets out Brexit plans - Politics live</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Over the summer there has been much comment about the turf wars between Johnson and Fox. Don\u2019t underestimate Davis in this regard, however. We know he has very strong views on delivering an <a href=\"http://www.daviddavismp.com/david-davis-writes-for-conservative-home-about-the-economic-strategy-for-brexit/\" title=\"\">export-led set of trade deals</a> that put him on a collision course with Fox. In his generally anodyne statement he was careful to mention issues \u2013 trade and business \u2013 that Fox, whose brief is non-EU trade, will nevertheless regard as his own.</p> <p>The reality is that the Brexit department is embarking on a course whose detailed destination it does not know. The real revelation in government policy on the EU in the last few days has been that no one \u2013 not Davis, not May, not anyone \u2013 actually knows what kind of a Brexit deal they really want. Politically, migration is top of the government\u2019s agenda, but the balance between migration control and EU single market access is speculation, even within Whitehall, because not only do ministers disagree but the EU does too.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"b6c6e8fc5001ed079eafd7e89388e9d36edf6d2b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b6c6e8fc5001ed079eafd7e89388e9d36edf6d2b/0_0_280_280/280.png\" alt=\"Mark Wallace\" width=\"280\" height=\"280\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/mark-wallace\" title=\"\"><strong>Mark Wallace</strong></a><strong>: </strong>Davis has shown he is still a formidable performer</h2> <p>What Brexit takes away, it can also give. While David Cameron and George Osborne were cast out of government by the referendum, David Davis has found himself lifted on to the frontbench, a full eight years after he chose \u2013 unwisely \u2013 to leave it. While some new to the despatch box can look a little nervy, particularly if they have just been handed responsibility for a hugely complex brief, he seemed completely at ease.</p> <p>That\u2019s not surprising; having cut his teeth as Europe minister in John Major\u2019s troubled government, he knows the issues inside out, and he has spent recent years preparing in detail for the Brexit process.</p> <p>If anyone thought that his time spent as a freelance campaigner on the backbenches might have diluted his aptitude for parliamentary performance, they were mistaken. He has evidently never lost the very specific skill set required to bat from the ministerial crease \u2013 friends were welcomed, enemies rebuffed and technicalities negotiated, and his position remained firm throughout.</p> <p>His opponents failed to produce anything to seriously unsettle him. The SNP angrily demanded more detail, but he remained insistent on doing things in his own good time, thank you very much. If anything, Emily Thornberry\u2019s attempt to insist that MPs get a vote on the outcome of the referendum seemed to add fuel to his fire, as he denounced her as an opponent of democracy, trying to stymie the will of the people.</p> <p>The new Brexit secretary demonstrated to the Commons that he was still a formidable performer, with the expertise and the rhetorical speed to defend his position. The big question will be whether he ever needs to deploy a similar defence at the cabinet table, should the prime minister\u2019s position come to differ from his. It is hard to imagine him backing down in that circumstance, either.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"4317980458c7079b7d328158d7e5d8072cdee189\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4317980458c7079b7d328158d7e5d8072cdee189/0_0_480_480/480.png\" alt=\"Deborah Orr\" width=\"480\" height=\"480\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/deborah-orr\" title=\"\"><strong>Deborah Orr</strong></a><strong>: </strong>We won\u2019t know what the mandate mandated for years</h2> <p>There\u2019s something a bit cart before the horse about this whole Brexit thing. David Davis, the Parliamentary Supremacist in Chief, reiterated in the Commons today that there was a national mandate for leaving the EU. He added, rather too quickly, that having provided the mandate so obligingly, \u201cpeople will want to know what Brexit will mean\u201d.</p> <p>Leaving the EU meant different things to different people. (While staying in simply meant staying in.) In the coming months and years, leavers will learn whether the national mandate they assisted in providing was they one they had in mind or the one someone else had in mind.</p> <p>If Davis knew what sort of national mandate he had in mind, he doesn\u2019t seem too keen to draw attention to the fact. He is staring, it seems, at a blank sheet of paper, on which he is eager to doodle. Davis is gathering together a large department, who will busy themselves with sounding out as many organisations and people as possible, before deciding exactly what our \u201cnew freedoms, new opportunities and new horizons\u201d are going to be. If only we could stay in this state of excited anticipation forever, the unknown future always bright.</p> <p>Davis was, for a man so concerned with \u201cthe sovereignty and supremacy of this parliament\u201d, awfully bossy about the kind of EU he wants to see after we\u2019ve left. He wants it to be strong, steadfast and successful. He just doesn\u2019t want Britain to take part in such an endeavour. Anyone used to subsidy from the EU, however, can relax until 2020, when EU promises already made will be reassessed.</p> <p>Which basically means that a lot of people won\u2019t have that much clarity what the national mandate mandated until four more years have passed. No wonder people are already acting like the Brexit vote never happened. Even Davis seems keen to make long-winded assertions promising that long-winded assertions will have to wait.</p>",

  "<p>Cameron Leslie has had better weeks. On Tuesday, the co-founder of Fabric, arguably the UK\u2019s best known nightclub, faces Islington council in a licence review hearing that will determine the future of the venue. But with a growing discourse around the cultural and economic significance of the capital\u2019s clubland and increasing frustration from clubbers after years of venues closing their doors, Tuesday\u2019s meeting represents so much more than the survival of one club. <br></p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t say I can give you confidence,\u201d says Leslie. \u201cI\u2019m hopeful. But this is a real complex challenge. Look at the picture of London in 2006 then in 2016, and just take that as a snapshot. This is not a thriving industry.<strong> </strong>If we close I think it would be a rather damning testament to exactly where we are at the moment.\u201d</p> <p>Fabric\u2019s situation has shocked the clubbing community. Three weeks ago the club <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/11/fabric-london-nightclub-close-weekend-deaths-teenagers\">closed its doors</a> after its licence was suspended following two drug-related deaths this summer.

Deaths from ecstasy have been increasing \u2013 with the drug said to be at its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/jun/15/ecstasy-mdma-warning-after-pills-found-with-double-or-triple-doses-in-uk\">strongest in over a decade</a>. According to the <a href=\"http://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/bulletins/deathsrelatedtodrugpoisoninginenglandandwales/2015-09-03\">Office for National Statistics</a>, deaths from ecstasy rose from eight in 2010 to 50 in 2014. This year reports of those dying from ecstasy \u2013 usually teenagers \u2013 have been frequent. Last week a 17-year-old boy, believed to have taken drugs, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/28/two-held-suspicion-drug-offences-leeds-festival\">died at Leeds festival</a>. </p> <p>Despite incidents like these becoming more common, the most sincere harm-reduction efforts have not come from the government, rather the initiatives of smaller groups and charities. In August Mixmag launched a <a href=\"http://mixmag.net/feature/were-launching-a-campaign-to-promote-safe-ecstasy-use\">campaign</a> to promote safer ecstasy use, advising its readers: \u201cDon\u2019t be daft, start with a half.\u201d Meanwhile charities such as <a href=\"http://chillwelfare.org.uk/\">Chill Welfare</a> and <a href=\"http://wearetheloop.co.uk/\">the Loop</a> \u2013 whom Fabric has collaborated with \u2013 have taken their pioneering drug testing and advice centres to festivals in the UK. But this is by no means the norm.</p> <p>\u201cThe government isn\u2019t doing anything at all in terms of harm reduction,\u201d says Duncan Dick, editor of Mixmag, explaining why the magazine started the campaign. He points out that harm reduction strategies are far more critical to stopping future drug deaths than trying to stop drugs coming into clubs. \u201cHow do you stop people taking drugs before they get into a club?\u201d he says. \u201cThey can\u2019t even keep drugs out of a prison.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"8a3dcb42287933a52d3fec0a0bbd9745239d9f7a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8a3dcb42287933a52d3fec0a0bbd9745239d9f7a/0_0_2037_3072/663.jpg\" alt=\"Fabric nightclub in Farringdon, London.\" width=\"663\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Reduced opening hours would be a slow and painful death\u2019 \u2026 Fabric nightclub in Farringdon, London.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sarah Lee for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Fabric hopes the licensing committee will take its ambition to \u201cset a new gold standard for safe clubbing\u201d seriously. Among the measures it wants to introduce is a new search policy, industry-leading training for staff to identify and tackle drug\u00ad taking and drug dealing in clubs and a working group with the police and drugs awareness charity the Loop to establish best practice and continually review its operations. The hope is that Islington council will support them in doing this. </p> <p>As for what the outcome will be on Tuesday, it may not be a binary one. Perhaps the most difficult for the club would be if it is allowed to stay open but with conditions that make it unworkable as a business \u2013 such as reduced opening hours \u2013 a situation that led to the recent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jun/10/glasgow-arches-club-goes-into-administration-and-is-set-to-close\">closure of the Arches</a> in Glasgow. \u201cIt would be a slow and painful death,\u201d says Leslie, who has 250 members of staff to think about as well as himself. </p> <p>At a time when City Hall is only just beginning to shape a policy on the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/small-business-network/2016/jul/13/open-all-hours-24-hour-businesses-night-time-economy\">night-time economy</a> and the cultural value of dance music and its venues barely starting to be acknowledged, Fabric\u2019s closure would set an unnerving precedent for the capital. Clubs of that size could become a thing of the past. </p> <p>\u201cYou can\u2019t get bank funding and why would any private individual put their money into building a large-scale venue when the risks are so great that your licence can be removed for events sometimes out of your control?\u201d says Leslie. \u201cWhy would anybody do that? The night-time economy is broken.\u201d</p> <p>In a letter to Islington council\u2019s licensing board, Mixmag\u2019s editor, along with more than 900 others, wrote passionately in support of Fabric. Shutting it down, he wrote, would be an act of \u201cself-mutilation\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t rip the heart out of London by closing Fabric,\u201d he wrote. \u201cOnce it\u2019s gone we will have lost so much more than just a club.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>\u201cI think I\u2019m losing my voice,\u201d says Nick Cave, early on in this documentary, directed by Andrew Dominik of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/jan/08/the-assassination-of-jesse-james-brad-pitt\">The Assassination of Jesse James</a> renown. Cave certainly sounds a little croaky at the time, but the metaphorical ramifications are not in the slightest bit lost on the spindly, silk-shirted poet of ruination and loss. </p> <p>And so begins the transformation of this film from a hagiographic, but essentially standard-issue, promotional film for Cave\u2019s upcoming album, into an undeniably moving contemplation of shattering loss and \u2013 as Cave repeatedly terms it \u2013 \u201ctrauma\u201d.

She wanted to become an engineer but watched as men were promoted ahead of her. Darden confronted the division chief and asked why men who had the same education and experience as her \u2013 and often less \u2013 were promoted while she was not. \u201cHis answer was that the women had never complained about it before,\u201d remembers Darden. There was the belief that women would give up work as soon as they had children. \u201cYou would find that, for the most part, that was not true for a lot of black women who, once they went to work, had to continue to work.\u201d</p> <p>Darden argued her case, and was almost instantly promoted to an engineering team where she started her career in sonic boom research. She would later complete a doctorate in mechanical engineering, but her early work provided some of the fundamentals in sonic boom reduction technology. During the course of her 40-year career at Nasa, Darden became one of the world\u2019s leading experts in this area.</p> <p>She had started her Nasa career in the computer pool in 1967 (it had been desegregated by then), and she knew several women who had been in that first cohort of West Computers. \u201cI knew that I stood on their shoulders and was able to do some things because of what they had done,\u201d says Darden. \u201cAnd I like to think that some of the younger ones might have stood on my shoulders, too.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Does Amy Schumer\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/aug/31/amy-schumer-review-edinburgh-playhouse\">new tour</a> justify the hype? I caught up with it at the O2 in London on Sunday night and one of the aspects that struck me most was the unresolved tension \u2013 a creative tension, probably \u2013 between Schumer\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2012/mar/21/sarah-silverman-jesus-is-magic\">Sarah Silverman</a>-style faux-arrogance (\u201cI\u2019m a superstar, you\u2019re lucky to be near me\u201d) and her self-loathing (\u201cI am trash\u201d). The reason it struck me so forcibly was because I\u2019d just spent three weeks at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/edinburgh-festival-2016\">the Edinburgh festival</a>, watching comedians foreground their personal problems. Schumer is a comic with challenges of her own but \u2013 in time-honoured comedian fashion \u2013 she chooses to keep them at arm\u2019s length rather than putting them centre-stage.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/aug/31/amy-schumer-review-edinburgh-playhouse\">Amy Schumer review \u2013 sex, neuroses and gun control from a sure-footed star</a> </p> </aside>  <p>That\u2019s not to say Schumer is evasive about her body-image issues. There\u2019s the routine where she parts her legs ever further until she identifies the moment her thighs stop touching. There are multiple jokes about women\u2019s magazines, Hollywood and the pressure on women to be thin. She is by turns defiant of these pressures, and vulnerable to them. She knows she\u2019d be (only) the third best-looking bartender in the bar, she says. She shows us paparazzi shots of her and her sister, and tells us that (generally, not just in these pictures) she looks like \u201cgarbage\u201d.<br></p> <p>At that moment, the audience intervenes; there are cries of \u201cno!\u201d to rally Schumer\u2019s self-confidence. That\u2019s an odd moment, but also the moment Schumer\u2019s show intersects with what we\u2019ve just seen at Edinburgh: an outpouring of emotional candour from clowns no longer prepared to conceal their tears. For years, cynics have been caustic about the preponderance of \u201cdead dad\u201d shows at Edinburgh \u2013 a catch-all complaint about the supposed obligation to make shows with an emotional or narrative arc that\u2019s anathema (some would say) to standup comedy. Until this year, that phenomenon was greatly, and tediously, exaggerated. But dead dads weren\u2019t the half of it at the fringe in 2016: in the work of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/aug/08/sofie-hagen-edinburgh-festival-review-shimmer-shatter\">Sofie Hagen</a>, Jayde Adams, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/jul/30/chris-gethard-depression-standup-comedy\">Chris Gethard</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/aug/11/rachel-parris-review-comedian-best-laid-plans-depression\">Rachel Parris</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/aug/25/scott-agnew-review-gilded-balloon-edinburgh\">Scott Agnew</a> and more, dead siblings and brain haemorrhages, histories of abuse, bad breakups and lifetimes of depression were all fair game.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"701851272227e55cc01bd87b95445b4e7e3824c2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/701851272227e55cc01bd87b95445b4e7e3824c2/0_384_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Chris Gethard\u2019s Edinburgh show focused on his depression.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chris Gethard\u2019s Edinburgh show focused on his depression.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo Macleod/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Is this the Oprah-fication of comedy? It sometimes felt like it. Or is it a valuable airing of feelings that society prefers us to deny or suppress? Well, it\u2019s that too. It certainly enriches or complicates our expectations of what a comedy show can deliver. In that Schumer moment, when the audience collectively gave her a supportive hug, or the closing stages of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/aug/12/richard-gadd-review-banshee-labyrinth-edinburgh\">Richard Gadd\u2019s award-winning show</a>, where he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/aug/22/richard-gadd-edinburgh-festival-fringe-comedy\">talks frankly</a> about the sexual assault he\u2019s spent four years running from, the audience-performer relationship is more about emotional intimacy and support than it is about laughter.<br></p> <p>The difference is, Schumer stumbled upon that connection seemingly by accident. Her show wasn\u2019t structured to foreground her distress or self-loathing \u2013 which were present only as a subtext or low drumbeat beneath the sassier shtick about her sex life, schmoozing with Hillary Clinton, or indeed gun crime. That\u2019s how comedians\u2019 real-world problems traditionally operate in their work: as something occasionally alluded to (although you\u2019re never sure if they\u2019re joking or not); as something to speculate about, or read about in interviews. Maybe the bottling-up of broiling feelings that couldn\u2019t be expressed, gives some acts their comic charge? Or maybe it denied us intimate, insightful comedy shows that those acts never felt it appropriate to make?<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/aug/27/amy-schumer-not-trying-be-likable\">Amy Schumer: \u2018I'm not trying to be likable\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I really enjoyed Schumer\u2019s show \u2013 and she\u2019s perhaps a bad example to hang these thoughts on because, by any normal standards, she\u2019s an emotionally intelligent and candid comic. But Edinburgh imposed (however temporarily) abnormal new standards, by which Schumer might easily make a whole heart-on-sleeve show fronting up about her body-image anxieties \u2013 or indeed (as per <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/aug/27/amy-schumer-not-trying-be-likable\">Emma Brockes\u2019 recent interview with her</a>) the difficult childhood that contributed to them. Instead, we\u2019ve got this intriguing clash of swagger and self-disgust, these slightly awkward asides implying low self-esteem, that sit there unresolved. As an audience member, I\u2019m happy with that. I don\u2019t (always) need the full story: I think the hints, loose ends and contradictions add up to something complex and human, and funny too. But a new context has been established for emotional candour in comedy, and next to its oversharing figureheads, Schumer looks positively coy by comparison.</p>",

  "<p>Donald Trump\u2019s golf resort near Aberdeen is being sued for breach of privacy and damages by a rambler who was filmed without her consent on the course.</p> <p>A lawyer acting for Rohan Beyts, a retired social worker and environmental activist, has accused Trump\u2019s staff of breaching the Data Protection Act by taking mobile phone footage of her in April as she allegedly urinated behind a dune on the course. <br></p> <p>Beyts\u2019s lawyer, Mike Dailly, has accused Trump\u2019s staff of illegally filming and retaining that footage, after the Guardian <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/11/trump-scottish-golf-resort-admits-breaching-data-protection-law\">revealed </a><a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/11/trump-scottish-golf-resort-admits-breaching-data-protection-law\">last month</a> that the resort had breached the UK\u2019s strict laws on data protection and privacy.</p> <p>Trump International Golf Course Scotland, which is wholly owned by the Republican presidential candidate, admitted it had failed to register with the information commissioner\u2019s office, the UK\u2019s data protection regulator. This was despite operating at least nine CCTV cameras at the resort and holding records on thousands of guests, 95 employees and a large number of contractors and suppliers. </p> <p>The resort also breached official guidelines on using CCTV by failing to display prominent signs warning visitors and guests at the course and its 19-bedroom boutique hotel that they were being filmed. </p> <p>In a statement, TIGCS said the failure to register with the commissioner was a clerical error, and it had submitted its registration on 10 August. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Under Scotland\u2019s wide-ranging laws that uphold public access to open land, Beyts and a friend had used a public footpath across the Trump course to walk past the clubhouse to reach a thick band of sand dunes and beach bordering the course. </p> <p>As they came back from their walk, the pair say there were challenged by resort staff and then photographed by a local newspaper photographer. </p> <p>Three days later she was visited at home by two Police Scotland officers who formally charged her with public annoyance. A third officer in charge of the complaint told her that two members of Trump\u2019s staff and a guest on the course had filmed her on their mobile phones as she ducked out of sight. </p> <p>Beyts, 62, has been a longstanding critic of Trump\u2019s development, and her prosecution raised fresh accusations from Trump\u2019s critics that his staff were deliberately persecuting his opponents and closely monitored their movements on the resort.</p> <p>Dailly, the principal solicitor at Govan Law Centre in Glasgow, said the resort\u2019s admissions raised substantial doubts about the legality of its use and circulation of any video footage, whether taken by a CCTV camera or a smartphone. </p> <p>\u201cThis is a straightforward claim for invasion of privacy, on the basis that the golf course has admitted that they weren\u2019t registered with the ICO,\u201d he said. \u201cThat means they weren\u2019t in a position to be processing people\u2019s data [lawfully] because they weren\u2019t doing it under the auspices of the legislation.\u201d</p> <p>Dailly has written twice to TIGCS advising it that Betys is seeking \u00a33,000 damages under the Data Protection Act for breach of privacy and for being \u201cdeeply distressed\u201d by being filmed. He said Beyts would start court proceedings if the company rejected her damages demand.</p> <p>TIGCS told the Guardian that the complaint was without foundation. \u201cMs Beyts has no claim against us,\u201d a spokeswoman said. \u201cCCTV footage had no part in the police investigation. Her prosecution was based on three eyewitness accounts.\u201d The company did not answer further questions.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s Scottish spokeswoman, Sarah Malone, told the Sunday Herald in April that the complaint against Beyts was wholly justified. \u201cThis disgusting and shameful act took place in broad daylight in full view of our staff and guests by an individual who has been disruptive in the past,\u201d she said.</p> <p>On 24 May, Beyts received an official warning letter from local prosecutors under the Civic Government (Scotland) Act that put the charges on record for two years, without involving a court hearing, which she has since refused to accept. Her refusal means local prosecutors have six months to take further action.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Beyts said she was not pursuing the case for the money. A keen rambler and outdoors enthusiast, she said the experience in April had left her feeling vulnerable and insecure every time she went for a walk and needed to urinate outside. She now fears she could be filmed anywhere.</p> <p> \u201cIt is absolutely not about the money: it\u2019s about the principle, making sure that people can feel free to walk on a place where they previously they could walk, unmolested, to stop people feeling intimidated.\u201d</p>",

Men (and women) from all walks of life. I don\u2019t like the thought of it any more than you probably do, but I don\u2019t have the luxury of pretending it doesn\u2019t happen. It does. As a former escort, I\u2019ve lived it. I\u2019ve entertained men who, when the fun has ended, call their wives to tell them they\u2019re off to pick the kids up from school.

What two consenting adults agree to do together is up to them. Trying to \u201cend demand\u201d \u2013 which is never going to work anyway \u2013 only puts sex workers at greater risk.

I haven\u2019t. For most people it\u2019s just a job. I know people who\u2019ve done it once or twice when they needed a bit of extra cash, and others purely for the thrill. That\u2019s right. Sex work can be fun. Exciting. Lucrative. And, believe it or not, sane adults can and do choose to do it of their own free will.</p> <p>Banning all sex work because of sexual exploitation is like banning all factories because of a handful of sweatshops. The difference between a willing sex worker and someone who has been forced to do it is the difference between a cleaner and a slave. We managed to explain this important distinction to the committee, but it wasn\u2019t easy. Let me be clear: from start to finish, the committee was heavily skewed towards <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2013/dec/11/uk-nordic-model-prostitution-clients-buyer-sex\">the Nordic model</a> of criminalising those who buy sex rather than those who sell it. Yes, Vaz is a hypocrite if the claims about him are true, but that does not change the committee\u2019s important findings that criminalising sex work puts sex workers in danger.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"7a575d8ab0c47b0724d49422ba3be9f61b67f9e0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7a575d8ab0c47b0724d49422ba3be9f61b67f9e0/0_0_480_480/480.png\" alt=\"Peter Tatchell\" width=\"480\" height=\"480\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/petertatchell\">Peter Tatchell</a>: \u2018There is no contradiction between Vaz\u2019s public pronouncements and private behaviour\u2019</h2> <p>Keith Vaz may have behaved recklessly and said some ill-advised things. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s blameless. But as far as we know he has not committed any crime and is not guilty of hypocrisy.</p> <p>Buying sex is not an offence, the men were consenting adults, there was no use of cocaine and poppers are legal. Vaz has supported gay equality and the decriminalisation of sex work. There is no contradiction between his public pronouncements and his private behaviour.</p> <p>So where is the public interest in outing him? This looks like a classic tabloid sting perpetrated by the Sunday Mirror for sensationalist motives in order to boost sales. The whole scenario may have been set up by the newspaper in collusion with the escorts, in order to entrap the MP. This could even include the paper assisting with the recording equipment and laying in wait outside the flat where the rendezvous with Vaz took place (although the paper denies this). It may even have prompted the escorts to ask Vaz leading questions about drugs. The Sunday Mirror allegedly paid the escorts \u00a330,000.</p> <p>This was not about defending the public interest. It looks like a sordid money-making conspiracy by the newspaper and the escorts \u2013 a throwback to the squalid tabloid excesses of the 1980s. To establish the truth, the Sunday Mirror must come clean about whether it knew in advance about the escorts meeting Vaz and whether it collaborated with them. How much did the paper pay the escorts for their story? Was there a signed contract? If so will the paper now publish it?</p> <p>Given the absence of any public interest justification, there is prima facie evidence that the Sunday Mirror has broken the press regulation code prohibiting unwarranted intrusion into privacy.</p> <p>It said that Vaz failed to declare an interest when his home affairs committee was investigating a ban on poppers and sex work criminalisation (he opposed both). Perhaps he should have declared an interest, but I am not sure that his failure to do so is a major lapse. After all, we don\u2019t demand that MPs who drink and smoke declare an interest when they discuss legislation affecting the alcohol and cigarette industries. There is never any insistence that MPs who have pension plans step aside from committees discussing pension regulation or that gay MPs must come out and declare themselves before voting on gay issues. I sense a whiff of double standards.</p> <p>Finally, I sympathise with Vaz\u2019s wife and children. Perhaps they never knew. But we must also remember how difficult it is for gay and bisexual people to come out in some sections (not all) of the Asian community. Homophobia kept Keith Vaz in the closet and we should be angry about that.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"30806a87833875ab9c8b4c2b0fdcfb5526e8ebe9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/30806a87833875ab9c8b4c2b0fdcfb5526e8ebe9/0_0_280_280/280.png\" alt=\"Julie Bindel\" width=\"280\" height=\"280\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/juliebindel\">Julie Bindel</a>: \u2018If Vaz is a sex buyer, how can he not have a stake in the committee\u2019s findings?\u2019</h2> <p>As predicted, the boys are out to defend Keith Vaz. <a href=\"http://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/keith-vaz-prostitution-scandal-is-a-private-matter-says-jeremy-corbyn-a3336496.html\">Jeremy Corbyn has said</a> that the scandal is a \u201cprivate matter\u201d.

In its <a href=\"https://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/home-affairs-committee/inquiries/parliament-2015/prostitution/\">recent interim report</a>, the committee stated that it is \u201cnot yet persuaded that the sex buyer law is effective in reducing, rather than simply displacing, demand for prostitution\u201d. If the Nordic model was applied in England and Wales, those engaged in activities such as those Vaz is alleged to have partaken in would face criminal sanctions. If Vaz is himself a sex buyer, how can he not have a stake in these findings?</p> <p>The current law is that criminal charges can be brought if a person pays for sex with somebody who is \u201ccontrolled for another person\u2019s gain\u201d. Significant numbers of women and smaller numbers of men in the UK have been coerced into the sex trade, including those from poor and developing countries. To argue that Vaz, if he has paid for sex, can continue as chair of the very committee that will soon decide whether or not sex buyers should be criminalised is ludicrous. Vaz should step down now, and the interim report be scrapped and rewritten once the new chair is appointed.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"77d1edda41627f2cf86418c0b9bba776c1490c8d\"> <img src=\"https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2016/09/05/Margaret_Corvid_opt.png\" alt=\"Margaret Corvid\" width=\"280\" height=\"280\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/margaret-corvid\">Margaret Corvid</a>: \u2018Prurient interest must not derail the chance for sex workers to live free from fear and stigma\u2019</h2> <p>I\u2019m no fan of Keith Vaz, but when I read that he\u2019d been accused of hiring male sex workers, I knew that defending him isn\u2019t about him \u2013 it\u2019s about our right as sex workers to work without threat of violence and arrest.</p> <p>The papers call him a hypocrite for alleged gay sex and for hiring sex workers when he\u2019s chaired a <a href=\"https://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/home-affairs-committee/news-parliament-2015/prostitution-report-published-16-17/\">parliamentary committee investigating the sex work laws</a>.

Its groundbreaking inquiry heard testimony from current and former sex workers, receiving written submissions from hundreds of us, who asserted, in accord with the most rigorous research, that decriminalisation would drastically improve our safety and health, letting us work together and letting us go to police when we\u2019re robbed or assaulted, rather than fearing they will mock, arrest or deport us.</p> <p>The committee <a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/home-affairs-committee/news-parliament-2015/prostitution-report-published-16-17/\">recommended the decriminalisation of sex workers</a> working together for safety; those recommendations were not the result of Vaz\u2019s alleged lusts. They emerged from a multi-party inquiry based on scientific evidence and the testimony of those affected most by criminalisation. Whether Vaz stays or goes, we must not let prurient interest in his personal life derail this precious moment \u2013 this chance for sex workers in the UK to live a life free from fear and stigma. The committee\u2019s recommendation for decriminalisation must stand.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"b40ba57e6b8b3d9ab96e9749d03bf4df92f5f55a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b40ba57e6b8b3d9ab96e9749d03bf4df92f5f55a/0_0_480_480/480.png\" alt=\"Joan Smith\" width=\"480\" height=\"480\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/joansmith\">Joan Smith</a>: \u2018It\u2019s hard to think of a more blatant conflict of interest\u2019</h2> <p>Public attitudes to prostitution are changing. In Sweden, where what\u2019s known as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2013/dec/11/prostitution-sweden-model-reform-men-pay-sex\">the Nordic model of prostitution policy</a> was first introduced, a majority of the public now regards paying for sex as a form of abuse. Women and men who sell sex no longer face criminal sanctions but, crucially, people who buy it do.</p> <p>In this country, we still have out-of-date laws that criminalise vulnerable individuals who are in reality victims of a vast commercial sex industry. That\u2019s one of the reasons why many of us would like to see a sex buyers\u2019 law introduced in the UK, forcing men who drive this trade (and it is mostly men) to face up to their responsibilities.</p> <p>The Labour MP Keith Vaz chairs a powerful House of Commons committee that has been holding an inquiry into this key area of public policy. It has heard evidence from a number of organisations that support the Nordic model, yet no one knew that a change in the law may \u2013 if the <a href=\"http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/married-mp-keith-vaz-tells-8763805\">allegations in the Sunday Mirror</a> are true \u2013 affect the committee\u2019s chair directly.</p> <p>That\u2019s why these claims, no matter how luridly they have been presented, are in a different category from other stories exposing the private activities of well-known people. To take a recent example, the argument for publishing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/apr/13/mp-john-whittingdale-had-relationship-with-sex-worker\">details of the sexual relationships of the former culture secretary, John Whittingdale</a>, was undermined by the fact that there was no clear evidence they had affected the way he did his job.</p> <p>Vaz\u2019s situation is very different from Whittingdale\u2019s. To put it bluntly, he appears to have chaired hearings where campaigners proposed a change in the law that could, in theory, turn his own private behaviour into a criminal offence. This is jaw-dropping stuff, and it\u2019s hard to think of a more blatant conflict of interest.</p>",

Shaking her head at the claim that she was going soft on controlling immigration, the prime minister said: \u201cWhat the British people voted for on 23 June was to bring some control into the movement of people from the European Union to the UK. A points-based system does not give you that control.\u201d</p> <p>In an attempt to illustrate her point, May said Heathrow staff had told her and David Cameron that immigrants were abusing student visa rules through a points-based system.</p> <p>\u201cBut because they met the criteria, they were automatically let in,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s the problem with a points-based system. I want a system where the government is able to decide who comes into the country. I think that\u2019s what the British people want.\u201d</p> <p>After the former Ukip leader Nigel Farage suggested that the prime minister was betraying leave voters, No 10 issued a statement on Monday saying the government would devise an immigration system that gave it more control than a points-based system.</p> <p> \u201cOne of the opportunities of Brexit is that we will be able to control the number of people coming to Britain from the EU.

In Australia, they have a points-based system and they have higher immigration per capita than Britain. A points-based system would give foreign nationals the right to come to Britain if they meet certain criteria. An immigration system that works for Britain would ensure that the right to decide who comes to the country resides with the government.\u201d</p> <p> A points-based system applying to migrants from across the world was first suggested by Ukip and quickly championed by the leave campaign, spearheaded by the foreign secretary, Boris Johnson. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>It would have <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jul/12/uk-immigration-system-not-points-based-minister\">allowed equal access to the UK</a> based on certain criteria, such as skills and qualifications, without giving any special access to those from the EU.</p> <p> Farage said: \u201cTheresa May\u2019s track record on immigration as home secretary was appalling and her comments rejecting an Australian-style points system really worry me.</p> <p> \u201cThere is already huge anxiety out there in the country regarding Theresa May\u2019s reluctance to trigger article 50.

Theoretically, this could include a work permit or visa system, restrictions on entry to those with job offers, a quota system or an emergency brake.</p> <p> However, the prime minister has given no details about how this might be done and has not answered the crucial question of whether the government could give preferential access to EU citizens over those from the rest of the world.</p> <p> The dilemma for May is that a number of EU states have indicated that the UK will not get preferential terms for trading without accepting <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/31/after-article-50-the-eu-trade-and-movement-deals-the-uk-could-seek\">at least a degree of free movement</a> for EU citizens.</p> <p> Carlo Calenda, the Italian economic development minister, told Bloomberg: \u201cWe cannot waste two years by negotiating with the UK how to maintain them inside without them wanting to be inside.

  "<p>The decision by leading leave campaigners such as Boris Johnson to endorse Nigel Farage\u2019s policy of an Australian points-based system for a post-Brexit British approach to immigration was one of the bigger surprises of the referendum campaign.</p> <p>For, as experts such as the Migration Observatory <a href=\"http://www.migrationobservatory.ox.ac.uk/resources/commentaries/uk-immigration-policy-look-like-brexit/\">have pointed out</a>, points-based systems have been used by countries such as Canada, Australia and New Zealand with liberal migration policies looking to admit more people than come under company-sponsored work permits alone.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/sep/05/david-davis-brexit-commons-statement-leaving-uk-since-brexit-vote-poll-suggests-politics-live\">Theresa May promises only 'some control' over EU migration post-Brexit - Politics live</a> </p> </aside>  <p>On one calculation, introducing a scaled-up Australian system in Britain could actually double annual immigration to the UK to 1.5 million or more.</p> <p>So it is no wonder that on Monday at her G20 press conference in Hangzhou, the prime minister decisively rejected a points-based immigration system. </p> <p>She argued that the \u201ctick-box\u201d approach of allowing in everyone who meets the criteria was a recipe for abuse, citing the example of \u201cbogus overseas students\u201d. She said that a new immigration policy would involve Britain \u201cregaining an element of control\u201d over EU migrants coming into the country.</p> <p>So what\u2019s wrong with a points-based system? The Australians introduced theirs in 1979 with the aim of attracting skilled migrants from anywhere on the planet. It has certainly helped grow their population to the point where those born overseas now account for 28% of the population \u2013 double the British share.</p> <p>The idea of points-based system \u2013 under which migrants who score highest on qualifications, experience, youth, education and language fluency are offered permanent citizenship \u2013 sounds fair but even the Australians have moved away from that model. </p> <p>For it is a system that means the state, rather than employers, must decide whether childcare centre managers, electrical engineers or even ballerinas are in short supply and should be opened to migrants. Companies sometimes don\u2019t share the state\u2019s assessment of an individual\u2019s overseas experience or qualifications, and in 2013 more than 13% of those who arrived under the points system were unemployed.</p> <p>In fact, the Australians have now introduced an employer-led system of temporary and permanent work visas that have left the points-based system covering only 15% of all migrants entering Australia.</p> <p>As Alp Mehmet of the anti-migration group Migration Watch UK has <a href=\"http://www.migrationwatchuk.org/press-release/398\">put it</a>: \u201cA points-based system might suit the Australians who are trying to increase their population but, in fact, it is extremely complex and would be a non-starter for the UK. Yet another rehash of such a system would be a disaster.\u201d</p> <p>But Britain has a points-based system for non-EU migration so why not for EU migration? As the prime minister knows only too well, the points-based system for skilled non-EU jobs in Britain introduced in 2008 is already full of holes and exceptions. </p> <p>Its cap of 20,700 on tier-two skilled migrants has only recently been reached as exceptions have been repeatedly made in the face of business pressure, notably intra-company transfers and lately to recruit NHS nurses. This was also criticised by the Conservatives as a mechanical \u201ctick-box\u201d immigration system that fails to recognise the complexities of migration.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>So if not a points-based system to reduce Britain\u2019s near record level of 327,00 net migration a year, then what? The main options being canvassed are:</p> <p><strong>Work permits: </strong>As advocated by Lord Green, the chairman of MigrationWatch UK, who proved highly influential in shaping May\u2019s immigration policies as home secretary. He has suggested a Brexit negotiating position that opens with an offer of free movement for European Union tourists, students, pensioners and other self-sufficient people on the basis that it is reciprocated.</p> <p>But that would be accompanied by a proposal that all entry to the UK to work for both EU and non-EU citizens should be subject to the present points-based system of work permits with the cap expanded as necessary. Cap to be decided not by business but by national need. Green claims this could cut net migration by 100,000. A further deep cut would be achieved by a much tougher regime against non-EU students who fail to leave at the end of their studies. Imposing work permits on EU citizens would, however, breach EU free movement rules and so likely lead to highly restricted access to Europe\u2019s single market for goods and services.</p> <p>\u201cThe issue is confidence in the government\u2019s intention to reduce immigration from the EU. This is what the public voted on, not on a particular system. In fact, the prime minister was right to indicate that the Australian points-based system is not appropriate for the UK. The way forward is to expand and adapt our present work permit system. In reality, this will be simpler and more effective,\u201d said Green on Monday.</p> <p><strong>Restricting free movement from the EU:</strong> May herself spelled out a year ago how she thought that Britain could close the door to unskilled labour from within the European Union without losing the UK\u2019s access to the single market.</p> <p>\u201cReducing net EU migration need not mean undermining the principle of free movement,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/news/world_news/article1600014.ece\">she said in a Sunday Times article.</a> \u201cWhen it was first enshrined, free movement meant the freedom to move to a job, not the freedom to cross borders to look for work or claim benefits. Yet last year, four out of 10 EU migrants \u2013 63,000 people \u2013 came here with no definite job offer whatsoever.\u201d</p> <p>The latest figures show that the proportion of EU migrants to come to work in Britain in a specific job has risen to more than 70%, with 176,000 having a definite job offer in their pocket. The other 127,000 who came in the last 12 months were looking for work in Britain and most of them found one.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2111c7a0745107a44064b2b68a5b7b7f49ee3463\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2111c7a0745107a44064b2b68a5b7b7f49ee3463/0_199_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Passport control at Gatwick airport\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An outright ban on the 127,000 who came looking for work is highly likely to breach the EU treaties on free movement.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Oli Scarff/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>An outright ban on the 127,000 who came looking for work is highly likely to breach EU treaties on free movement. But a system in which labour migrants who arrive without a job have to register on a Home Office database, perhaps be issued with an identity card and be obliged to go home if unable to find a job within a few months, might fall within the kind of reform of the EU\u2019s free-movement rules that Britain could put on the table in the Brexit negotiations.</p> <p><strong>Emergency brake: </strong>This option has been backed by both ends of the political spectrum. The Institute of Public Policy Research has argued for Britain to negotiate to be able trigger a temporary halt in EU migration in particular occupations, sectors or locations where wages are being undercut. The Adam Smith Institute has argued for the UK to join the European Economic Area whose members have the power to exercise an emergency brake on any of the four \u201cfreedoms\u201d including freedom of movement.</p> <p>The IPPR\u2019s emergency brake will require constant sectoral and local analysis of labour market wage levels. It also raises questions about who takes the decision to operate the brake and for how long. A decision by Britain alone is likely to produce retaliatory action with countries across the EU closing their doors to British workers. David Cameron raised the question in his pre-Brexit vote tour of the EU and came back with a limited offer of an emergency brake on benefits \u2013 no payments for the first four years. But even that faced threats of legal challenges from other EU states.</p>",

Employment also expanded, following stagnation in July. But the inflationary consequences of a <strong>weaker pound</strong> appear to be making their mark in the services sector \u2013 <strong>input prices</strong> rose at the fastest pace in 33 months.</p> <p>The strong recovery in all three CIPS surveys in August suggests that the likelihood of a <strong>recession this year is looking more remote</strong>, in line with our view. </p> <p>However, a composite PMI, which weights together the sectoral PMIs by their respective shares in the economy, points to an economy that will struggle to see much growth in Q3. </p> <p>Our expectation, allowing for the official and survey data available so far, suggests that <strong>GDP will expand by around 0.2%</strong>.

If we take the July/August average of our weighted PMI for services, manufacturing and construction at face value, it points to stagnation in Q3.<br></p> <p>Importantly, whereas the PMIs indicated that the economy slowed in Q2 to a growth rate of around 0.2% quarter on quarter, official data showed the economy actually expanded by 0.6%.

  "<p>Northern Ireland\u2019s most senior judge has demanded the creation of a special unit to deal with a backlog of inquests into some of the most controversial killings of the Troubles.</p> <p>Sir Declan Morgan, the region\u2019s lord chief justice, said the power-sharing executive at Stormont should fund the new unit.</p> <p>No inquests have yet been held into dozens of killings, including the shootings of republican terror suspects and civilians by the police and British army. There are also cases in which allegations have been made of collusion by security forces in loyalist murders, and of British agents operating within the republican movement.</p> <p>Speaking at the start of the new legal term in Northern Ireland, Morgan described the slow pace of inquests into these deaths as \u201chugely disappointing\u201d and said a dedicated unit operating over five years was needed to cope with the backlog.</p> <p>\u201cI therefore call again on the local executive and legislature, and on the UK government, to play their part as a matter of urgency. We cannot move on while we remain under the shadow of the past. Nor should we.

  "<p>The leading cause of death from infectious disease worldwide, tuberculosis (TB), is associated with immigration in the UK. There, I\u2019ve said it. Now let\u2019s move on because no Donald Trump-esque wall or Brexiteer is going to keep TB out. Perhaps we should ban all migration?

Not to mention the ethical considerations. In any case, there is currently no effective way to treat the latent form of multi-drug resistant TB (MDR-TB). So, to my mind, there really is just one choice \u2013 we must tackle TB on a global scale and that means overseas investment.</p> <p>For those of you that think TB was eradicated long ago, consigned to history with the likes of Edgar Allen Poe, think again.

  "<p>There\u2019s supposed to be a war for talent. If so, it became pretty clear last week why Britain\u2019s investment banks are losing it. The recruitment filter, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/sep/01/top-graduates-missing-out-on-banking-jobs-for-lacking-polish\">revealed in a report from the Social Mobility Commission</a>, works like this: you can only join the customer-facing part of an investment bank if you went to one of four public schools; got a first from one of five universities; and possess \u201csheen\u201d.</p> <p>Yes, sheen. And polish. No matter how good you are, if your tie is not right or your suit does not fit like a glove, you are destined to take your excellence somewhere else.</p> <p>Little wonder, then, that the world of investment banking suffers from group-think on a scale that crashed the world markets in 2008 and has led to wave after wave of fines for fraudulent behaviour.</p> <p>Given that the signifiers are so clear and obvious, how would you scam your way in? How would you hoodwink the informal process based on \u201cspecific behaviours, speech patterns and dress codes\u201d? Unwittingly, the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/socio-economic-diversity-in-life-sciences-and-investment-banking\">commission\u2019s report</a> provides plenty of clues.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/02/city-of-london-dress-code-brown-shoes-finance\">How well-heeled City types leave you brown and out in finance</a> </p> </aside>  <p>First, the obvious don\u2019ts. No beards. Not Muslim ones, not hipster ones, not the stubble worn by movie stars. None. One of the clearest demographic faultlines in the world runs along <a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=White+Kennett+Street&amp;gws_rd=cr,ssl&amp;ei=ADHNV767PMPJgAa556jIBg\">White Kennett Street</a>, in east London \u2013 where the beards of hipsterland begin and the twice-shaven faces of the City end. Also, no brown shoes.</p> <p>In fact, the brown-shoes thing, plus numerous other faux-pas, can be easily avoided by reading <a href=\"http://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/\">GQ magazine</a>. But buy the British edition because if you read the Italian one you are going to arrive in the wrong kind of suit, shoes and \u2013 very important, this \u2013 socks. I once met a management whizz-kid thrown out of his City internship for wearing plaid socks.</p> <p>You need the haircut, the suit, the shoes, the tie. They are all \u2013 like the outmoded economic theories you will have to waffle on about \u2013 available as a job lot in and around Savile Row.</p> <p>The suit has to be blue or grey. Sure, you will see electric-blue suits, or pinstripes, on the streets of the Square Mile, but don\u2019t try to pull this off unless your family\u2019s yacht has a helicopter pad. Shoes have to be black leather and click as you strut along a corridor, shutting down venerated retail chains by text message.</p> <p>The bankers surveyed were disdainful of people who \u201ccan\u2019t wear a suit\u201d. To their jaundiced eyes, this means you have bought a suit off the peg, and cannot afford six grand to have one made that immobilises you at the armpits and makes your bum look like that of a figure skater.</p> <p>The haircut has to be bouffant. One of the surest signs you have walked into a workplace that recruits only from the elite is that the haircuts do not change. Neat back and sides, big bouffant quiff, no gel, no wax, no putty. These are the marks of convicts or advertising men, not the front-office banker.</p> <p>All this is fakeable, with money, practice, a willing tailor and obedient hair. But then you need to open your mouth to speak.</p> <p>Take careful note of what\u2019s happening to the \u201cposh\u201d English accent. It is no longer enough to have the calm, fruitily inflected RP common among barristers. More fashionable now is the \u201cRees-Mogg\u201d \u2013 a throwback to the accent of the aristocracy in the 1920s, where the consonant \u201cr\u201d migrates slightly towards \u201cw\u201d and even spontaneous utterances sound like they have been written by Michael Gove. This is achievable with practice.</p> <p>Next you need subject matter. <a href=\"http://www.laffercenter.com/the-laffer-center-2/the-laffer-curve/\">The Laffer curve</a>, which attempts to illustrate that taxing the rich is futile, is a good thing to talk about. Also the work of any fashionably rightwing African economist. And Venezuela. If in doubt, diss Venezuela.</p> <p>But \u2013 and this is critical \u2013 you must understand that words are not the primary medium of communication. If you are going organise a team to fix <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libor\">Libor</a>, you don\u2019t say \u201clet\u2019s fix Libor\u201d. You use subtle understatements, allusions, metaphors, sentences that trail off, eyebrows that curl independently. To learn this you have to hang around in places like St Moritz, and not just for a single season.</p> <p>As to the CV, you must make it up. The four spring internships claimed by elite candidates in their first year at university (the new normal according to the report) come in limited supply. Apart from the sons and daughters of the bankers themselves, most other places will be reserved for the offspring of Arab despots and Russian crooks.</p> <p>And if you are proud of having climbed in Glencoe on your Duke of Edinburgh award, be aware that\u2019s not good enough. You must have, at the very least, discovered a new species in the Amazon while in the lower sixth, or still better, a new tribe. You must have proof of this on Facebook and Instagram. Also references from Nobel prize-winning economists.</p> <p>Fortunately, it\u2019s all fakeable.</p> <p>But here comes the unfakeable part. You must go into that interview not just with a tie from Ede &amp; Ravenscroft and shoes from Lobb. You must go in believing that it is the duty of high finance to avoid tax, rewrite the law of sovereign states, enrich dictators, boost inequality and \u2013 in return \u2013 voluntarily clean up litter in Haringey on the annual away day.</p> <p>Above all, you must subscribe to the efficient-markets hypothesis so unequivocally that it becomes your religion. This says it\u2019s the job of the financial market to allocate capital efficiently. Centuries of good practice show that capital can only be allocated efficiently when the participants in the deal played rugby with each other at the age of 12.</p>",

Where I\u2019m from \u2013 Belfast in Northern Ireland \u2013 peace is intrinsically linked to the cooperation of nationalists and unionists, Protestants and Catholics. It is tied to the idea of a peace process, whereby the Good Friday agreement, a treaty tied to the European convention on human rights, has defined how two opposite sects can live alongside each other in harmony. </p> <p>But this peace is neither universal nor solid, as dissident groups and individuals seek to undermine it daily. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\">Brexit</a> has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/19/brexit-northern-irish-politics-border-eu-good-friday-agreement\">potentially catastrophic implications for the peace in Northern Ireland</a>, first for the validity of the peace process itself, and second if there is further separation from the Republic by a physical border. As such, the region\u2019s peace is at risk, as well as its development. </p> <p>If sustainable development is to progress in poverty-stricken countries around the world, peacemaking must play its part. Money diverted to arms, and aid funding used to to repair the damage caused by conflict, takes away from investment in hospitals, schools and young people\u2019s futures. However, it is the attitude that comes with war that is most significant, the placing of personal ambitions and strategies for power over the progression of the lives of your people. In Northern Ireland, rejecting this doctrine has so far enabled the fragile peace to endure. </p> <p>Until this power-hungry perspective changes, NGOs must focus on how to control the cause of the conflict.<br></p> <ul> <li><strong>Lucy Keown, University of Glasgow, UK</strong></li> </ul>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"020d3ae1f019939de72b4df051c7ff7508df4134\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/020d3ae1f019939de72b4df051c7ff7508df4134/0_438_5303_3183/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A family walks past a mural depicting a scene from Bloody Sunday in Londonderry, Northern Ireland\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A family in Londonderry, Northern Ireland, walks past a mural depicting the events of Bloody Sunday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Charles McQuillan/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Working collaboratively in conflict zones is vital</h2> <p>Development occurs in conflict.

Having regard to all the information available to us, we assess this test has not been met.\u201d <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p> His judgment is based largely on an Saudi-led inquiry into eight controversial incidents, including the bombing of hospitals. The report, published on 4 August, largely defended the bombing runs on the basis that the Saudis had received credible intelligence that enemy Houthi forces were in the area. In one case it offered compensation to the victims.</p> <p> Defending the credibility of a Saudi-led inquiry exonerating Saudi targeting, Johnson said: \u201cThey have the best insight into their own procedures and will be able to conduct the most thorough and conclusive investigations. It will also allow the coalition forces to work out what went wrong and apply the lessons learned in the best possible way. This is the standard we set ourselves and our allies.\u201d <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>The Johnson statement clarifies the UK position after ministers were forced to retract some statements asserting unequivocally that there had been no breaches of international humanitarian law by the Saudis in Yemen. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p> Subsequent to the Saudi inquiry report, Saudi airstrikes on 15 August left 19 killed and 24 injured when <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/15/saudi-led-air-strike-yemen-hospital-kills-at-least-seven\">a raid hit a Yemeni hospital</a> supported by M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF).

Such a move would infuriate Riyadh, unnerve arms manufacturers and embarrass the Conservative government. </p> <p>On 25 August the United Nations\u2019 top human rights official, Zeid Ra\u2019ad al-Hussein, called for an international independent inquiry into the Saudi air campaign. A UN report said 60% of the civilian deaths documented in a one-year period had resulted from airstrikes carried out by the Saudi-led coalition on weddings, markets, schools and hospitals. In several of those attacks, the UN said it was unable to identify any possible military target.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/22/why-do-they-target-us-yemeni-civilians-pay-the-price-of-escalating-crisis\">'Why do they target us?'

However, the latest incidents and the Saudi-led coalition\u2019s rejection of wrongdoing is likely to strengthen the case for the suspension of arms sales.</p> <p>In a series of written corrections made on 21 July, the last day of parliament, the Foreign Office withdrew previous claims that the UK judged that no breaches of humanitarian law had occurred, stating instead: \u201cWe have been unable to assess whether there is a breach of international humanitarian law.\u201d</p> <p>The Ministry of Defence also revised its position, stating it had \u201cnot been able to assess whether the Saudis were targeting civilians\u201d.

The Tory majority voted instead to refer the issue to the committee on arms exports controls.</p> <p>Since March 2015 Saudi Arabia, backed by its Sunni Arab allies, the US and Britain, have been launching airstrikes in neighbouring Yemen to reinstate the president, Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi, and counter advances by Houthi rebels.</p> <p>Houthi fighters, who belong to the Zaydi sect of Shia Islam, control the capital, Sana\u2019a, and the western part of Yemen, and are allied with the former president, Ali Abdullah Saleh, who led the country from 1990 to 2012. Hadi is currently living in exile in Riyadh, and the Saudis regard the Houthis as proxies for Iran. Peace talks sponsored by Kuwait broke down in August.</p>",

  "<p>With university fees of up to \u00a39,000 a year, it\u2019s important to make an informed decision about what and where to study. So how can you use a university open day to help you make the right choice? </p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s really important to make your choice based on the big picture,\u201d says Verity Law, senior marketing officer for UK recruitment at the University of Northampton. \u201cBefore you even arrive at the open day, get prepared. Note down the things you and your family think are important and split the list up between you all. </p> <p>\u201cMaking sure the course is right is one of the most important uses for an open day. It\u2019s your chance to find out exactly what your course involves, so ask questions about the topics you will study and what the work is like.\u201d </p> <p>David Seaton, head of student recruitment and engagement at the University of Bedfordshire, says: \u201cMake sure you have a good look at the halls. This is where you will be living, so it should form a big part of what you take away from the day. Speak to current students to hear what it is like to study at the university.</p> <p>\u201cThe town or city you are in could be your home for the next three years, so it\u2019s important to go off campus to get a feel for the area. Book a night in a hotel and make a day of it. Bring your family and friends \u2013 the more the merrier!\u201d </p> <p>Mandy Pine, development manager for recruitment and reputation management at Nottingham Trent University says lots of students turn up without a precise idea of what they want to study: \u201cIt is an opportunity for students to see the range of courses available \u2013 including some opportunities they may not have considered before, or even knew existed.</p> <p>\u201cBut, when it comes down to it, most people have a gut reaction to a place. There may be several universities that offer the right course and the right environment but don\u2019t feel right \u2013 so it\u2019s vital to visit and not just rely on information online or in the prospectus. It is always a personal choice.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Ellie Wynn, 18, visited two open days, including one at Leeds Beckett, where she is now studying psychology, with her mum, Paula McIntosh. Paula is now going through the process again with her 17-year-old son.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I went to an open day at Manchester University, it just seemed too big for me,\u201d says Ellie, \u201cbut as soon as I started the Leeds Beckett open day, the people were so nice and it just felt like home. </p> <p>\u201cI went with my mum \u2013 which wasn\u2019t embarrassing, everyone had their parents with them,\u201d she laughs. \u201cThe main thing I was interested in was more detail on the courses \u2013 you can see the module titles online, but talking to the actual lecturers and tutors that I knew I\u2019d have if I went there was brilliant. They went through every module and it sounded really interesting, then we went to a lab class and they picked someone out to be a guinea pig, with their eye movements monitored as they looked at an advert.\u201d </p> <p>Paula points out that her main priority on the open day was different to Ellie\u2019s: \u201cI was keen \u2013 with it being such a big city \u2013 that Ellie would be living somewhere safe, in accommodation closest to the university building. So we looked at that, and facilities outside of the course too. We also spoke to people in the hall manning different desks to find out about societies she could join. </p> <p>\u201cThere were practical things, too: a relative of mine who\u2019s done a degree is now working in a supermarket, which seems like a massive waste of his education. You have to make sure the students are going to come out of their university with good job prospects, so ask about how many kids are in employment after leaving and the type of industry they work in. Also, ask students what they think about the course they\u2019re on \u2013 can they choose certain aspects or is it all fixed?\u201d Ellie\u2019s top advice for would-be undergrads at open days is to chat to your lecturers: \u201cSee if you like them and find it easy to ask them for help. They are such a big part of your uni experience.\u201d</p> <p>Paula says she\u2019s really glad she went with Ellie: \u201cYou really do have to go and have a look to check that the university offers the experience your child is looking for. It\u2019s a very expensive thing to do, going to uni, so you need to get your choices right.\u201d And Ellie is adamant she has: \u201cAt the open day, Leeds Beckett just felt right. And a year later, I still think that. I love the university so much.\u201d <em>Lucy Tobin</em></p> <p><strong>Chloe Wiles, 19, from Billericay, Essex, is doing a BA (Hons) in applied theatre and community drama at the Liverpool Institute of Performing Arts (LIPA).</strong><br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"2abc744e8d2940caa9547e411ffaf793465ee65a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2abc744e8d2940caa9547e411ffaf793465ee65a/0_0_953_1204/792.jpg\" alt=\"Young woman in evening wear\" width=\"792\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Distance learner: \u2018It appealed to me more to go slightly further away from home,\u2019 says Chloe Wiles.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR Company Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I had been looking at acting courses, and my teacher suggested LIPA. The prospectus gave a lot of information, but on the open day, the head lecturer, Brendan, went into more depth and gave a huge presentation. He didn\u2019t hesitate to answer any of our questions. We also had second and third years on the course leading us around \u2013 we could ask them anything and get a realistic answer. And it was good to experience the overall friendliness of the course in person \u2013 you can\u2019t get that just by picking up a prospectus. I\u2019d found lots of courses down in London too, but it appealed to me more to go slightly further away from home, just to experience university a bit more.<br></p> <p>It\u2019s been a lot easier to cope with the distance than I thought it would be. The classes are small \u2013 they only let in about 20 \u2013 so it\u2019s almost like a family and you get loads of contact hours with lecturers \u2013 about 20 a week \u2013 so I\u2019ve been too busy to think about being away from home. </p> <p>When I came back at Christmas, my family were saying I\u2019d grown in confidence.

  "<p>With references to Star Wars, Star Trek and, er, Grange Hill, they threw everything at the Strictly launch and completely indiscriminately. Are we on Starship Strictly or is this the Class of Strictly 2016? Make up your minds! Heaven knows that seems ill-advised as a strategy, but it worked: a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/sep/04/strictly-come-dancing-launch-show-draws-more-than-10m-viewers\">record audience of 10 million</a>, almost 1.5 million up on last year. All the glitz, all the glamour, six new pro dancers (many of them looking barely legal) and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/02/ed-balls-interview-speaking-out-memoir-labour-blair-brown\">a former shadow chancellor</a> all added up to an opener which came across, although only just about, as poised and exciting.</p> <p>Welcome to Monday\u2019s Strictly Judgewatch. When things kick off in three weeks\u2019 time (they\u2019re currently on a break for training), we will be analysing the show from the point of view of each of the judges. Oh yes. Who does Darcey secretly hate? Who is always the subject of tellingly patronising platitudes from Len? Who will be first to bring Bruno to his feet? And who will finally crack the veneer of Craig\u2019s barely-concealed contempt for the whole enterprise? </p> <p>The launch show is the moment for the judges to practise their \u201cI\u2019m not bored, really\u201d face (mostly unsuccessfully) and for the professional dancers to practise their \u201cI really love my partner!\u201d face. This was particularly dramatic in the case of Katya Jones, the feline-faced new pro dancer paired with Ed Balls. It\u2019s worth watching this series for Katya\u2019s accent alone: the natural successor to Ola Jordan, her voice is a truly extraordinary and inimitable blend of Russia and Croydon. I do hope we hear a lot of it. </p> <p>The Strictly launch is always tricky. There is an awful lot of information to impart and nothing to actually judge, except for the wisdom of the pairings which can often be guessed by virtue of a) the height of the participants and b) the poorly-concealed Strictly reward system which means that favourite pro dancers like Kevin and Karen get paired with likely audience favourites like Louise Redknapp and Will Young. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"281b52e144f1c6c11820ed2a8c6d3043363f7edf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/281b52e144f1c6c11820ed2a8c6d3043363f7edf/0_0_2552_1070/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Darcey as Lieutenant Uhura in the nightmarish Strictly Starship opening sequence.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"419\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Darcey as Lieutenant Uhura in the nightmarish Strictly Starship opening sequence.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The judges were keeping their cards close to their chest with non-comments and random alliterations (a nod to the much-missed Arlene Phillips school of judiciously juicy judging). \u201cWe\u2019ve yet to see them strut their stuff ...\u201d \u201cThe girls are frisky and risky. The boys are powerful and perky.\u201d \u201cI think they will do very well.\u201d Close your eyes and it could be Crufts. But the best comment of the night? Bruno\u2019s enigmatic utterance: \u201cI know them in the temperament.\u201d What? </p> <p>Meanwhile Len looks rather tired of it all in this, his final series. I quite fancied Darcey as Lieutenant Uhura in the nightmarish Strictly Starship opening sequence. But Craig dancing Gangnam Style after a brief stint as Darth Vader brought us all crashing down to earth. Whose idea was this? I\u2019m minded to imagine that Craig has now stipulated in his contract that he must dance as much as possible. Every episode seems to feature more Astaire-style cameos. It\u2019s generous of him \u2013 who doesn\u2019t love to critique his finger placement? (Which is, irritatingly, usually utterly perfect. He does love a beautifully-splayed hand, does Craig, and he practises what he preaches.) </p> <p>Early audience favourites? Melvin Odoom (although there are already rumblings of a dance background), EastEnders\u2019 Tameka Empson and singer Anastacia: all with the charisma to match their enthusiasm. But beware the gymnast paired with the tiny new baby-faced boy. And I would never underestimate the combination of Natalie \u201cTerminator\u201d Lowe and the Olympian. Her face when she realised she had access to world-class athleticism in the training room ... Images of the glitter ball were shining in her eyes. My early fave? Judge Rinder. It\u2019s about time someone challenged Craig to a camp-off.</p>",
  "<p>Dozens of Conservative MPs have written to the prime minister, Theresa May, urging her to shift billions of pounds of post-Brexit farm subsidies towards protecting and improving the environment.</p> <p>The 36 MPs, including former environment ministers, also urge May to maintain the strong protection for wildlife and water provided by EU directives.

  "<p>Mexico was the focus of the global lens last week thanks to an unexpected and dreadful event: the visit of the most rude and unapologetic US presidential candidate in political history. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/31/donald-trump-mexico-visit-greeted-with-hostility-online\" title=\"\">Why did Donald Trump come here? </a>It was the question that millions of Mexicans kept asking ourselves while saying, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2016/aug/31/protests-mexico-city-donald-trump-visit-video\" title=\"\">\u201cYou\u2019re not welcome!\u201d</a></p> <p>The Republican presidential candidate arrived in my country offering diplomacy as fake as a $3 bill.

He has not only gathered the hate and distaste of the world, but with this visit to my country he has confirmed that he is without a doubt someone who cannot be trusted. You only have to look at the stunt that he pulled on his trip to Mexico: a charade to prove the unprovable \u2013 civility.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Trump is witnessing his own demise; he\u2019s aware that every poll is against him</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Trump has built his campaign based on the saying \u201cbad publicity is better than no publicity\u201d. It is clear that Trump loves only ratings, not credibility. His campaign is a farce and he has been deceiving his followers since the beginning. But the biggest issue is that he handles information like a virus, which has sickened the American people.</p> <p>Trump has said that Mexican and Latin American migrants are the ones who bring guns, crime and drugs into the US, that we Mexicans are responsible for violence. But while he points with one hand to Mexico, with his other hand he encourages the American people to arm themselves \u2013 according to US government figures, seven out of 10 seized weapons in Mexico come from the United States.</p> <p>Trump proves with such statements that he doesn\u2019t care about facts, he doesn\u2019t care about reality. Instead he keeps spreading his distorted point of view, suggesting that he\u2019s completely ignorant or he\u2019s lying.</p> <p>Last Wednesday, in front of the cameras he didn\u2019t have any choice but to recognise Mexico as a commercial partner, and the hard work Mexicans do in the US.

  "<p><strong>Hometown: </strong>Cardiff. </p> <p><strong>The lineup: </strong>Monique B (vocals), Cara Elise (vocals, guitar), Estelle Ios (vocals, bass), Vanity Jay (vocals, guitar), Ruth Vibes (vocals, guitar).</p> <p><strong>The background: </strong>Baby Queens have been likened to TLC produced by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/portishead\">Portishead</a>, and for once the impossibly alluring one-line pitch isn\u2019t too wide of the mark. They\u2019re an all-girl outfit (token male drummer, Leroy, not pictured) allying flawless R&amp;B harmonies to gritty, sometimes retro, sometimes reggae, soul, hip-hop, rocky or even trip-hop tinged production and arrangements. To put it another way, they\u2019re <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/mar/02/en-vogue-review-high-lustre-harmonies-and-crisp-baby-making-anthems\">En Vogue</a> mixed by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jan/29/massive-attack-someone-ready-to-bash-head-in-tour\">Massive Attack</a>. Or Destiny\u2019s Child at their most polished given some studio murk by Tricky. They\u2019ve been called a girl group with a difference, which might be fanciful, or might rather suit this bunch of DJs, tattooed bouncers and anti-nuclear activists (about which, more later). </p> <p>Clashes of opposites, meetings of minds from different aesthetic universes, often sound better on paper than in reality but with Baby Queens it works. Actually, although some of the production techniques are indeed trip-hoppy and 90s-inflected, it\u2019s not one of the crucial Bristol three at the controls, it\u2019s someone from over the (Bristol) channel: synth wizard <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/mar/09/pop-political-british-musicians-paloma-faith\">Cian Ciar\u00e1n</a> of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2015/mar/04/super-furry-animals-10-of-the-best\">Super Furry Animals</a>. He has put Baby Queens\u2019 soulful singing and their 60s Motown and modern R&amp;B beats and melodies through the console at Strangetown Studios in Cardiff and they\u2019ve come out the other side sounding like, well, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHwXoY0LiQk\">SWV</a> produced by SFA. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"New band of the week: Baby Queens\">  <iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/253751682%3Fsecret_token%3Ds-3KggH&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>The results can be heard on their imminent self-titled debut album, and they\u2019re uniformly excellent. The single, Tired of Love, opens with soulful melismas, just to prove they can do all that X Factor exhibitionism lark, but this is more than just a showcase for technically fancy warbling. There is a gospel sadness to it, even as the song becomes increasingly exultant, with handclaps and a rousing melody. \u201cRuth grew up going to church, so we wanted to bring some of that to the song,\u201d explains Estelle. Melodi opens with Beach Boys harmonies and has the graceful glide of Marvin\u2019s What\u2019s Going On, with production that splits the difference between coolly classic and edgy-modern. You and I is one of many songs that, if you were told it was a cover version by an obscure soul artist, you wouldn\u2019t blink. The lyrics (\u201cAbout love and life,\u201d says Estelle, not very helpfully) are a weak point on this entirely self-penned album, with too many banal rhymes of the \u201chigh\u201d/\u201cdie\u201d or \u201cpain\u201d/\u201cinsane\u201d variety, but really, if Noel Gallagher can get away with it, why can\u2019t they? Besides, as Estelle says, \u201cThe lyrics are the least important part for me \u2013 it\u2019s about the feeling, the whole song in general.\u201d </p> <p>The music more than makes up for any lyrical shortcomings. It Feels Like - with its ghostly, spacious production \u2013 will be loved by those for whom Unfinished Sympathy is a Year Zero artefact. Forever is <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otwkrRLRkXQ\">King Tubby-dubby</a>, not so much lovers rock as lovers trip-hop. Samsara, a solo writing effort from Estelle, appears to have come from a different group, and there\u2019s a good reason for that: she initially intended it for Zefur Wolves, the \u201cshoegazey-grunge\u201d band she\u2019s in with her partner, Ciar\u00e1n. She\u2019s often in the studio with him, offering advice on production. \u201cWe try and stay away from cliched beats,\u201d she says \u2013 her favourite SFA track is <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYheU3MJ-fk\">Some Things Come from Nothing</a>, and you can tell why from its scuffed, acoustic-electronic ambience.</p> <p>Baby Queens cover the waterfront in terms of vocal styles and positions on the singing scale: Estelle and Ruth sing low, Monique takes the mid-range, and Cara (the one with the neon pink hair in the photo) and Vanity handle the high notes. There\u2019s a reason they\u2019re simpatico: Estelle and Cara are sisters, while Ruth and Monique are cousins, with Vanity their adopted sister. Cara\u2019s breathy-cute sigh takes the lead on Had My Heart, with shades of the Mya/Aaliyah/Ciara school of R&amp;B . Does Estelle think people will be able to tell where Baby Queens are from, from listening to them? Could they be a NYC girl group, or does essence-of-Cardiff spill out of their music? \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a Cardiff thing,\u201d she says. \u201cNew York to me is a band like Interpol. There are cities with their own individual flavour - Detroit techno, say, or Iceland\u2019s electro dream-pop - but I think we could be from anywhere.\u201d</p> <p>There are no simpering stage school sirens here. Estelle used to be in a punk band with her sister called IDFT which stood for If Destroys Feel True, but they weren\u2019t angry \u2013 she\u2019s more into \u201cthe melodic side of punk, like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/ramones\">Ramones</a>\u201d. She identifies her and Cara\u2019s style as \u201csurf and skate\u201d while Monique and Ruth are urban and Vanity with the purple hair is \u201cmore feminine and R&amp;B\u201d. She goes further: Vanity is the \u201chappy\u201d Baby Queen, with a day job as a carer in an old people\u2019s home. Monique \u2013 the \u201ccool\u201d BQ \u2013 is a DJ. Cara is the \u201cspaced-out\u201d one who looks after children with disabilities. Ruth is \u201cserious on the surface but knows how to have a laugh\u201d \u2013 she works as a nightclub bouncer. As for Estelle herself, she\u2019s \u201cchilled\u201d (she\u2019s a massage therapist), with a side order of righteous indignation: she\u2019s an anti-<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/trident\">Trident</a> campaigner who regularly goes on marches with CND. \u201cI\u2019m the politically charged one,\u201d she laughs. Still, you won\u2019t hear any protests from us about Baby Queens and their marvellous, moody girl group soul-pop. <br><br><strong>The buzz:</strong> \u201cImagine Portishead producing TLC\u201d \u2013 BBC Wales. </p> <p><strong>The truth: </strong>They\u2019re the new (Baby) queens of Wales. </p> <p><strong>Most likely to: </strong>Get tired of love. </p> <p><strong>Least likely to:</strong> Get tired of Baby Queens. </p> <p><strong>What to buy:</strong> Tired of Love is released by Strangetown on 9 September.

  "<p>Like many good ideas, <a href=\"http://www.orderella.co.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Orderella</a> was conceived over a pint. The pub, in London, was very busy. \u201cIt was my turn to get the next round, and I had to wait 10 to 15 minutes,\u201d recalls Dennis Collet, CEO and co-founder of the company. \u201cThat got us thinking, wouldn\u2019t it be nice not to have to go through all that rigmarole to be served?\u201d<br></p> <p>Orderella\u2019s proposition is simple: let your phone do the queuing. Its app (for Android and Apple mobiles) lets consumers order and pay for their drinks without leaving their table, so friends and colleagues can spend more time talking to each other. Users can also pre-order drinks in advance \u2013 from a taxi, for example. \u201cIf you lose half of your evening to queuing, that\u2019s a lot of banter you\u2019re missing,\u201d Collet notes.</p> <p>The lightbulb moment came in 2012. Collet was working at Ernst &amp; Young, as a consultant specialising in mobile payments. \u201cHailo had just started \u2013 you could hail a cab from a few miles away, but in a bar you couldn\u2019t order a drink to come across the room,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Collet and his four co-founders, who have backgrounds in finance, legal and IT, funded the launch themselves, with help from family, friends and business contacts. This paid for initial development of the app, by a German IT agency. </p> <p>Consumers download the Orderella app for free \u2013 70,000 have downloaded it to date \u2013 and more than 10,000 actively use it. In a typical venue offering the facility, 5 to 10% of customers will order their drinks this way, says Collet. There is no surcharge for using it: drinks cost the same as paying cash at the bar.</p> <p>\u201cAt first we charged the venues a commission, and a lot of them were interested in trying the app,\u201d he explains. But not everyone followed through, which meant the company had invested time getting them up and running for nothing. So in 2015, the business switched to a fixed monthly subscription fee.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/small-business-network/2016/aug/12/use-logic-emotion-negotiate-entrepreneurs\">'Show me the money!' \u2013\u00a0do you use logic or emotion to negotiate?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Orderella covers all the transaction costs. \u201cThis encourages venues to promote the app, because they\u2019re avoiding credit card fees,\u201d explains Collet. Its primary market is bustling city pubs, sports bars, student unions and bars with large outdoor areas. \u201cThe app comes alive where it\u2019s busy or there is a distance to the bar,\u201d Collet says. </p> <p>The real money-spinner for the business is in selling promotions to brands \u2013 for example, drinks companies like Diageo. Other commercial customers include PayPal who can run their own campaigns, perhaps offering a discount to customers who pay through its channel. Together, these commercial partners account for 70% of Orderella\u2019s revenues.</p> <p>Orderella isn\u2019t the first app that aims to put an end to queuing. Kate Nicholls, CEO of the <a href=\"http://www.almr.org.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Association of Licensed Multiple Retailers</a> warns that similar apps have failed to crack this market, perhaps due to a lack of take-up by venues, or apps not working as they should in practice. Nicholls says: \u201cTo succeed, apps like this need widespread functionality and reliability. If customers cannot use the app in their favourite bar or are struggling with reliability issues, they will abandon it pretty smartly.\u201d</p> <p>Michael Mann, owner of <a href=\"http://theearlspencer.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Earl Spencer</a> in London, was an early adopter of Orderella. However, a family-orientated venue with a constantly changing menu, the pub found it added an extra layer of programming each day and so no longer uses it. Another complicating factor was that the app wasn\u2019t integrated with the till system, so staff had to also enter orders into the till.</p> <p>Mann sees Orderella\u2019s appeal for venues that have fixed menus or just serve drinks. \u201cThey\u2019ve had huge success in some pubs. If I had just a bar I\u2019d be using it for sure, it\u2019s a fantastic idea.\u201d</p> <p>Ben Perkins, head of consumer research at Deloitte, says one challenge for ordering apps is demonstrating that they improve efficiency. Pubs have a bar with staff behind it because this has traditionally been the most efficient way of serving a large volume of customers, says Perkins. </p> <p>However there is a trend towards a more independent and empowered consumer. \u201cWhat we may see with these apps is that traditional pubs or hotels need to adapt and change their environment.\u201d For example, in the future pubs might not have a bar, says Perkins.</p> <p>Collet says venues that use Orderella can process more orders as they handle fewer transactions \u2013 it typically saves staff 90 seconds per order, he says. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/small-business-network/2016/jul/15/the-doctor-will-see-you-online-now\">The doctor will see you online now</a> </p> </aside>  <p>To date, around 150 venues across the UK and Ireland have come on board, including temporary venues at festivals, banquets and awards events, and corporate VIP locations.</p> <p> The startup has so far raised \u00a32m in market funding in addition to the initial sums from existing contacts.

  "<p>A rocket crashing into a satellite and cutting off the internet may sound somewhat like the start of an end-of-the-world blockbuster; surely such destruction, and lack of Wi-Fi, could only be a harbinger of doom?</p> <p>Fortunately, the scenario that played out last week was slightly less portentous. A SpaceX rocket, part of Elon Musk\u2019s fevered attempts to eventually colonise Mars,<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/01/spacex-explosion-launch-site-florida\" title=\"\"> exploded on Thursday</a> as part of a failed pre-launch test fire, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/sep/01/mark-zuckerberg-spacex-explosion-africa-internet\" title=\"\">destroying a Facebook-owned satellite in the process</a>.</p> <p>The satellite, which cost the company around \u00a3150m, was due to be used as part of Internet.org, a project designed to bring web connectivity to areas of the world with limited internet access. Free Basics, a program developed by Facebook with six internet service providers, is an \u201conramp to the internet\u201d, designed to help those without the internet get online. Its latest iteration, in Nigeria, saw the launch of 85 free online services including healthcare offerings, job listings, education portals and, of course, Facebook itself.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Users of [Facebook's] service may be connected to the internet, but their browsing choices are severely limited</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>So far so good, right? Well, kind of. Providing access to the internet is a noble cause, particularly in parts of the world where it is severely limited or even non-existent. But should this infrastructure belong to a private company like Facebook, or should it be state-owned and maintained? Far be it from me to question the true nature of CEO Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s philanthropy, but no matter how charitable a cause Facebook is championing, its primary aim is to make money \u2013 often from monetising its users\u2019 data.</p> <p>It\u2019s not just an issue of infrastructure, either; the destruction of the satellite also raises important questions about net neutrality \u2013 that internet service providers, be it Sky, BT, or Facebook, should enable equal access to all content and applications on the web without favouring any source over another. The narrative Facebook has given Internet.org is lofty and well-meaning enough \u2013 it describes the difference a weather report could make for a farmer planting some crops, and talks of how free information could help a child without textbooks \u2013 but look beyond the sleek website and humanitarian buzzwords and it\u2019s a little more troubling.</p> <p>Users of the service may be connected to the internet, but their browsing choices are severely limited \u2013 the 85 services that are provided in Nigeria, for example, may be a good start for those getting to grips with the web, but are otherwise entirely inadequate. The whole point of the internet \u2013 the joy of it, the endlessly radical possibilities that are part and parcel of it \u2013 is that it\u2019s open, that it\u2019s neutral, that its users are free to say, do, and read almost anything they want on it.</p> <p>It\u2019s not been without critics on this front, either; when Facebook attempted to launch the Free Basics initiative in India it met fierce opposition from net neutrality groups who felt that the entire internet should be accessible to users. Several campaigns were set up to lobby against the service, with one, <a href=\"https://www.savetheinternet.in/\" title=\"\">Save the Internet</a> (now the Internet Freedom Foundation), stating that one network provider should \u201cnot have a competitive advantage for specific services\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cEverybody should have an equal opportunity to use the sites and services they want, irrespective of which provider they use to connect to the internet,\u201d the campaign wrote in its mission statement. Evidently Indian regulators agreed: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/feb/08/india-facebook-free-basics-net-neutrality-row\" title=\"\">Free Basics was blocked in February</a> until Facebook could provide more details about the terms of the service.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/sep/01/mark-zuckerberg-spacex-explosion-africa-internet\">SpaceX rocket explosion: Mark Zuckerberg laments loss of Internet.org satellite</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There\u2019s obviously no immediate need to panic \u2013 it\u2019s not like Zuckerberg is holed up in a den somewhere laughing maniacally about his omnipotent control of the internet. State-controlled infrastructure isn\u2019t always safe or reliable either \u2013 earlier this year, for example, the internet was effectively switched off in Iraq to prevent teenagers from cheating on their exams, and the internet is widely censored in countries such as China and North Korea. This, clearly, is not a favourable outcome.</p> <p>But if we\u2019re slightly more cynical about the whole endeavour, it\u2019s not hard to see why Facebook might be so keen to provide these services beyond its possibly genuine desire to create a more connected world. Facebook\u2019s user base has reached near saturation point in the US and Europe, making countries such as Nigeria and India potential goldmines when it comes to new sign-ups. More users, and more user data, benefit Facebook in one extremely simple way \u2013 financially.</p> <p>Like it or not, this financial consideration is a significant factor in the way that the company both provides its services and limits access to others. Free and open access to information is a right \u2013 and privately held companies should not be the ones who decide how, where, and to whom that right is bestowed.</p>",

His sporting talent was soon evident in judo classes \u2013 and when he was enticed into a gym his immense upper body strength became obvious.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2016/jul/23/ten-to-watch-meet-team-gbs-sporting-superheroes\">Ten to watch: meet Team GB's sporting superheroes</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Jawad emerged as an impressive force on the junior powerlifting circuit and, aged 19, he qualified for the 2008 Paralympic Games. The night before he was due to compete in Beijing, <a href=\"https://www.crohnsandcolitis.org.uk/about-inflammatory-bowel-disease/crohns-disease\">Crohn\u2019s disease</a> took its first, terrible hold of him. He would be almost as unlucky four years later when, at London 2012, his certainty that he had won a silver medal was curdled by controversy <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/aug/31/paralympics-2012-powerlifting-paralympicsgb\">and he ended up with nothing</a>. It seems incredible that, from a point of \u201chating\u201d his sport and his life, with Crohn\u2019s controlling him, Jawad would become a world champion in 2014.</p> <p>He is now in Rio and, just before we move deeper into the darker corners of his story, Jawad talks serenely. \u201cWhen I first started lifting I was loud and aggressive \u2013 but I\u2019ve learned to channel that aggression into a sense of calm. I know what I\u2019m doing. I\u2019m experienced. I just need to execute under pressure. When I was young it wasn\u2019t focused. Now I have this calm, quiet, channelled aggression \u2013 so I\u2019ve changed a lot these last two Games.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2016/sep/03/paralympics-against-odds-rio-can-deliver-games\">Paralympics: against the odds, Rio can deliver Games to treasure | Jacob Steinberg</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cOn Friday, I will remind myself I am in the best place I\u2019ve ever been in my career. I\u2019m the most relaxed I\u2019ve ever been going into a Paralympic Games. I\u2019ve done the work and I know that if I perform to my best I should come away with something. Eight years ago, Beijing was different. I wasn\u2019t aiming for a medal. I was only really there for experience because I was so young. I was just very happy and excited to be there. But training was incredible and two days before the Games I lifted a weight which would have actually won me bronze.</p> <p>\u201cBut I was unlucky, I got sick 24 hours before my competition. I didn\u2019t realise it was the start of Crohn\u2019s. I just thought I\u2019d got a bug so I went out and lifted the next day. I finished ninth. I had no idea how serious it was until I got back home and felt really sick. I was collapsing because of the pain. I was seeing blood in the toilet. I was really fatigued. I couldn\u2019t get out of bed. I lost 25kg in eight weeks. I knew then something was seriously wrong.\u201d</p> <p>Had he begun to fear cancer? \u201cExactly,\u201d Jawad says softly. \u201cThat\u2019s what they thought. I was being checked for loads of cancers and that got really scary. Luckily, it wasn\u2019t. It was Crohn\u2019s \u2013 and for me Crohn\u2019s disease meant nothing. I just thought I\u2019d take a pill and be better. But the doctor said this is an incurable life-long disease \u2013 and it is a disease that can hit you at any time. He explained that no Crohn\u2019s sufferer had ever won a medal at the Olympics or the Paralympics. I was so ill that I retired for six months.</p> <p>\u201cIt was devastating. I was only 19 and I thought I was living the dream but to crash down like that affected me. I got really sick and I had an operation in 2010 to remove part of my intestines. It was life-threatening and I could have died. But I came through it and I knew I\u2019d been given a second chance. So I had to embrace it. Obviously my friends and family weren\u2019t happy I wanted to come back but London 2012 was only a couple of years away and I thought I could make it. So two weeks after the operation I went to the gym \u2013 which is mad.\u201d</p> <p>Jawad laughs incredulously at the memory. \u201cAt first it was very up and down. One day I am fine and happy and the next day I am depressed and in pain and sick. There was never any consistency. But, luckily, five months before London the training picked up. I got to the point where I had not only qualified but could go in as a dark horse for a medal.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ee16baba4a21c46458c9bed8da3545fb9fe9c1a7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ee16baba4a21c46458c9bed8da3545fb9fe9c1a7/164_0_4210_2526/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ali Jawad\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ali Jawad competes in the 56kg powerlifting competition at London 2012.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Competing in his home Paralympics, Jawad felt inspired. \u201cI am British and so to represent my country in front of my friends and family was surreal. It was like a dream and I knew how hard I\u2019d had to work to get back from being so ill \u2013 and that everyone had written me off. So just getting to London 2012 was a massive achievement.\u201d</p> <p>His parents were in the sold-out crowd at the ExCel Arena where Jawad\u2019s name was chanted. \u201cI think my mum and dad were the loudest people in the arena,\u201d he chortles. \u201cSix thousand people cheering and you could hear my dad above anyone else. I loved that. I perform better in front of big crowds so for me the louder the better.\u201d</p> <p>Jawad broke the European record and then beamed in jubilation after his last lift. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyGliCoOGVo\">He appeared to have lifted 189kg</a> and to have secured silver but the judges ruled it out. His team management raised a protest against the ruling of a technical fault and the judges ordered a relift \u2013 even if his chances of success were ruined by the energy he had already expended. Jawad slipped down to a tie for third place. He felt even more crushed when he realised his Chinese rival would take bronze because he weighed slightly less than Jawad.</p> <p>\u201cThat day nearly broke me because I\u2019d had to fight so hard to get there. I was naive because I felt I was owed a little bit of luck and it turned out that I got the worst luck you could ever imagine. I was totally disillusioned. I had given up all my teenage years for lifting and I hated the sport and didn\u2019t want to come back. I was depressed and caused myself to flare with Crohn\u2019s. It wasn\u2019t until December 2012 that I sat down with my team and they said: \u2018Listen, in the last four years we\u2019ve only trained eight months and for you to win a silver that got taken away is huge. Imagine what you could do with four years of being healthy.\u2019 That made me realise I could go to Rio and hopefully redeem myself.\u201d</p> <p>London 2012 also made Jawad appreciate with fresh force how brave his parents had been in leaving Lebanon. \u201cI never really heard the stories until I was 14. I just wondered what had happened and how we got here. I asked my dad and he said: \u2018Yeah, we had to sacrifice a lot to get here. When you were born the doctor wanted to kill you off \u2013 he actually asked the question.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Jawad pauses as we imagine how his father must have felt in that moment \u2013 with a doctor wanting to terminate his son\u2019s life just because he had no legs. \u201cDisabled people back then were second-class citizens in Lebanon. My parents felt different, and even blessed I had been born. No matter my impairment and disability they wanted the best life possible for me. They knew they had to move away from Lebanon to give me a chance.</p> <p>\u201cBut they never wanted to move because all our family are there. So they had to rebuild a life in a foreign county. They could hardly speak any English and didn\u2019t have much money or education or qualifications for work. So for them to come over was a huge risk. Hopefully I\u2019ve paid my parents back but for them to build a life in Britain and to raise me the way they\u2019ve done is a credit to them. I get my mentality from them.\u201d</p> <p>That mentality meant that, in 2013, after committing himself to a strictly disciplined diet to control his Crohn\u2019s, Jawad set a world record. A year later <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/disability-sport/26918598\">he became world champion</a>. \u201cOh yeah,\u201d he says huskily. \u201cTo be controversially denied silver in my home games and then, a year later, be No1 in the world was huge. That justified why I carried on. Being world champion was even sweeter. But I\u2019m in much better shape now than I was for the [2014] world championships. So I should put in my best-ever performance in Rio.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/05/former-australian-paralympian-don-elgin-society-is-getting-a-bit-soft\">Former Australian Paralympian Don Elgin: \u2018Society is getting a bit soft' | Russell Jackson</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cFriday is arguably the biggest day of my life but I need to treat it as another gym session \u2013 a glorified gym session.

I said: \u2018Yeah, I\u2019m going on holiday.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>At least Jawad has an emotional holiday planned once the Paralympics are over. \u201cIt\u2019s funny you should ask me about Lebanon because I\u2019m going after Rio \u2013 for 10 days. It\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve been back in 15 years. I will see all my family again. Of course the power of social media means everyone in Lebanon can track my progress. They\u2019re all very proud but they want me to get the medal because they think I deserve it. Hopefully I will come back happy this time.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>Most years, soups \u2013 like pies, stews and crumbles \u2013 are banished for the summer before I cook them in an excited flurry about the same time as I stop wearing sandals.</p> <p>In winter, I find comfort in deep bowls of vegetables that don\u2019t require chewing. But summer soups are different. I want freshness, crunch, and zippy flavours. So many summer soups are cold, and while I do like a cold soup, I have to say I only crave it when the weather is blistering. I almost always want something warm at dinner time.</p> <p>These late summer soups focus on lightness and brightness. Some days it\u2019s a summery dal of red lentils, spiked with a heap of turmeric and finished with a brave amount of lemon juice. Other days it\u2019s a quick tomato soup, cooked with garlic, no onion, the vines kept on until it\u2019s blended and then finished with a lot of good olive oil.</p> <p>When I do crave a cold soup, I pile the blender with a couple of scooped\u2011out avocados, a head of fennel, a couple of spring onions, the juice of a lemon and some summer herbs, blended with a good handful of ice and drizzled again with good oil when it\u2019s served.</p> <p>There are, of course, gazpacho soups too, my favourite being a white one that\u2019s made with almonds, grapes and bread soaked in vinegar.</p> <p>This week though, it was a warm coconut soup with one of the freshest, cleanest flavour pairings I know: lemongrass and lime leaves. The next one has been made from the hero of the hour: papery husked corn on the cob (not least because its currently my little boy\u2019s favourite vegetable) teamed up with green chilli, courgettes and crisp lettuce.

  "<p>Unlike most US holidays, Labor Day is a strange celebration without rituals, except for shopping and barbecuing. For most people it simply marks the last weekend of summer and the start of the school year.</p> <p>The holiday\u2019s founders in the late 1800s <a href=\"http://www.jstor.org/stable/2079344\">envisioned something very different</a> from what the day has become. The founders were looking for two things: a means of unifying union workers and a reduction in work time.</p> <p>The first Labor Day occurred in 1882 in New York City under the direction of that city\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.questia.com/library/1459046/history-and-functions-of-central-labor-unions\">Central Labor Union</a>.</p> <p>In the 1800s, unions covered only a small fraction of workers and were balkanized and relatively weak. The goal of organizations like the Central Labor Union and more recent counterparts like the <a href=\"http://www.aflcio.org/\">AFL-CIO</a> was to bring many small unions together to achieve a critical mass and power. The organizers of the first Labor Day were interested in creating an event that brought different types of workers together to meet each other and recognize their common interests.</p> <p>However, the organizers had a large problem: no government or company recognized the first Monday in September as a day off work. The issue was solved temporarily by <a href=\"http://www.jstor.org/stable/2079344\">declaring a one-day strike in the city</a>. All striking workers were expected to march in a parade and then eat and drink at a giant picnic afterwards.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030214/1882-09-07/ed-1/seq-4/\">New York Tribune\u2019s reporter covering the event</a> felt the entire day was like one long political barbecue, with \u201crather dull speeches\u201d.</p> <p>Labor Day came about because workers felt they were spending too many hours and days on the job.</p> <p>In the 1830s, <a href=\"https://eh.net/encyclopedia/hours-of-work-in-u-s-history/\">manufacturing workers</a> were putting in 70-hour weeks on average. Sixty years later, in 1890, hours of work had dropped, although the average manufacturing worker still toiled in a factory 60 hours a week.</p> <p>These long working hours caused many union organizers to focus on winning a shorter eight-hour work day. They also focused on getting workers more days off, such as the Labor Day holiday, and reducing the workweek to just six days.</p> <p>These early organizers clearly won since the most recent data show that the average person working in manufacturing is <a href=\"http://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.t18.htm\">employed for a bit over 40 hours a week</a> and most people work only five days a week.</p> <p>Surprisingly, many <a href=\"http://press.princeton.edu/titles/6555.html\">politicians and business owners were actually in favor of giving workers more time off</a>. That\u2019s because workers who had no free time were not able to spend their wages on traveling, entertainment or dining out.</p> <p>As the US economy expanded beyond farming and basic manufacturing in the late 1800s and early 1900s, it became important for businesses to find consumers interested in buying the products and services being produced in ever greater amounts. Shortening the work week was one way of turning the working class into the consuming class.</p> <p>The common misconception is that since Labor Day is a national holiday, everyone gets the day off. Nothing could be further from the truth.</p> <p>While the first Labor Day was created by striking, the idea of a special holiday for workers was easy for politicians to support. It was easy because proclaiming a holiday, like Mother\u2019s Day, costs legislators nothing and benefited them by currying favor with voters. In 1887, Oregon, Colorado, Massachusetts, New York and New Jersey all declared a special legal holiday in September to celebrate workers.</p> <p>Within 12 years, half the states in the country recognized Labor Day as a holiday. It became a national holiday in June 1894 when <a href=\"http://history.house.gov/Historical-Highlights/1851-1900/The-first-Labor-Day/\">President Grover Cleveland signed</a> the Labor Day bill into law. While most people interpreted this as recognizing the day as a national vacation, <a href=\"http://www.senate.gov/reference/resources/pdf/Federal_Holidays.pdf\">Congress\u2019s proclamation</a> covers only federal employees. It is up to each state to declare its own legal holidays.</p> <p>Moreover, proclaiming any day an official holiday means little, as an official holiday does not require private employers and even some government agencies to give their workers the day off. Many stores are open on Labor Day. Essential government services in protection and transportation continue to function, and even less essential programs like national parks are open. Because not everyone is given time off on Labor Day, union workers as recently as the 1930s <a href=\"http://www.jstor.org/stable/41814888\">were being urged</a> to stage one-day strikes if their employer refused to give them the day off.</p> <p>In the president\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/09/08/presidential-proclamation-labor-day-2015\">annual Labor Day declaration</a> last year, Barack Obama encouraged Americans \u201cto observe this day with appropriate programs, ceremonies and activities that honor the contributions and resilience of working Americans\u201d.</p> <p>The proclamation, however, does not officially declare that anyone gets time off.</p> <p>Today most people in the US think of Labor Day as a non-controversial holiday.</p> <p>There is no family drama like at Thanksgiving, no religious issues like at Christmas. However, 100 years ago there was controversy.</p> <p>The first controversy that people fought over was how militant workers should act on a day designed to honor workers. Communist, Marxist and socialist members of the trade union movement supported 1 May as an international day of demonstrations, street protests and even violence, which <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/picture-gallery/news/2016/05/01/protesters-clash-with-police-at-may-day-rallies-world-wide/83792826/\">continues even today</a>.</p> <p>More moderate trade union members, however, advocated for a September Labor Day of parades and picnics. In the US, picnics, instead of street protests, won the day.</p> <p>There is also dispute over who suggested the idea. The earliest history from the mid-1930s credits Peter J McGuire, <a href=\"http://www.jstor.org/stable/41814888\">who founded the New York City Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners</a>, in 1881 with suggesting a date that would fall \u201cnearly midway between the July 4 and Thanksgiving\u201d that \u201cwould publicly show the strength and <em>esprit de corps</em> of the trade and labor organizations\u201d.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/41838739\">Later scholarship from the early 1970s</a> makes an excellent case that Matthew Maguire, a representative from the Machinists Union, actually was the founder of Labor Day. However, because Matthew Maguire was seen as too radical, the more moderate Peter McGuire was given the credit.</p> <p>Who actually came up with the idea will probably never be known, but you can vote <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.dol.gov/general/laborday/history\">online here</a> to express your view.</p> <p>Today Labor Day is no longer about trade unionists marching down the street with banners and their tools of trade. Instead, it is a confused holiday with no associated rituals.</p> <p>The original holiday was meant to handle a problem of long working hours and no time off. Although the battle would seem to have been won long ago, this issue is starting to come back with a vengeance, not for manufacturing workers but for highly skilled white-collar workers, many of whom are constantly connected to work.</p> <p>If <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/3046429/the-new-rules-of-work/the-highest-paying-jobs-of-the-future-will-eat-your-life\">you work all the time</a> and never really take a vacation, start a new ritual that honors the original spirit of Labor Day. Give yourself the day off. Don\u2019t go in to work. Shut off your phone, computer and other electronic devices connecting you to your daily grind. Then go to a <a href=\"http://www.wbaltv.com/news/labor-day-cookout-ideas/41411898\">barbecue</a>, like the original participants did over a century ago, and celebrate having at least one day off from work during the year!</p> <p><em>This article originally appeared on <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/us\">The Conversation</a></em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Counter\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://counter.theconversation.edu.au/content/64526/count.gif&quot; alt=&quot;The Conversation&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>",

  "<p>For months, fierce political campaigns, vicious personal attacks and sporadic allegations of electoral irregularities had filled the airwaves and fuelled social media discourse in Hong Kong. One candidate was <a href=\"http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/2009109/hong-kongs-new-territories-west-candidate-drops-out-race\">forced to drop out</a> and flee to the UK after receiving threats of physical harm.</p> <p>That is because the stakes had never been higher.</p> <p> On Sunday, in the first election in Hong Kong since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/29/hong-kong-democracy-protests-china-umbrellas-police\">the umbrella movement was spawned in 2014</a>, more than 2 million citizens \u2013 nearly 60% of all registered voters \u2013 went to the polls. Forty seats on the legislative council, or Legco, the region\u2019s parliament, were up for grabs by candidates representing a wide spectrum of political parties. They ranged from diehard Beijing loyalists to pro-democracy veterans and younger, more radical newcomers calling for autonomy <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/26/liberate-hong-kong-calls-independence-china-elections-loom\">and even independence</a> from China.</p> <p>As the count continued overnight, it appeared that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/05/hong-kong-poll-pro-independence-activists-poised-to-win-seats-in-record-turnout\">the new kids on the block</a> would have the last laugh. Six fresh faces had peeled enough votes from their more established counterparts within the opposition camp to become a force to be reckoned with in a fast-changing political landscape. </p> <p>One of them, Nathan Law, had protested alongside <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/15/hong-kong-student-joshua-wong-avoids-jail-over-pro-democracy-protest\">Joshua Wong</a> during the umbrella movement. Earlier this year, the two founded <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/10/hong-kongs-umbrella-movement-spawns-new-political-party-demosisto\">a political party, Demosisto</a>, running on a platform of self-determination and self-governance. Voters saw Law gradually reinvent himself from a street activist to a serious politician. On Monday morning, he became the youngest person to win a Legco seat in Hong Kong\u2019s history.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"441edbd69c53bc37bb95f973921ba531209a981f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/441edbd69c53bc37bb95f973921ba531209a981f/0_123_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Joshua Wong celebrates after Nathan Law wins seat\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Joshua Wong celebrates after Nathan Law wins seat.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tyrone Siu/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There were others, too: a university lecturer who was heavily involved in the umbrella movement; an environmentalist seeking to reform the city\u2019s land development; a pair of young activists from <a href=\"https://www.hongkongfp.com/2015/10/31/hkfp-interview-umbrella-soldier-group-youngspiration-vows-to-find-new-path-to-democracy/\">a year-old party called Youngspiration</a>; and a firebrand from the controversial Civic Passion group, known for its localist, anti-mainland rhetoric.</p> <p>The pack of six won largely at the expense of the traditional pan-democratic parties, who are regarded by many young voters as too passive and conservative to tackle the modern political reality.

Other so-called \u201cpan-dems\u201d, such as the Neo Democrats and the Association for Democracy and People\u2019s Livelihood, failed to secure a single seat and now face political extinction.</p> <p>While pundits debate the shifting dynamics the new Legco will bring, one thing is certain: a generational handover within the opposition has taken place, whether the pan-dems like it or not.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/05/hong-kong-poll-pro-independence-activists-poised-to-win-seats-in-record-turnout\">Hong Kong elections: anti-Beijing activists gain foothold in power</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The shift in the tectonic plates of local politics is widely considered a direct consequence of Beijing\u2019s increasing intervention in Hong Kong, including the ever-tightening grip on the city\u2019s freedom of expression, as well as other civil liberties and local affairs. Recent happenings such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/17/china-behaving-like-gangster-state-with-bookseller-kidnap-say-hong-kong-politicians\">the disappearances of booksellers</a> and <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/27/world/asia/hong-kong-corruption-icac-china.html\">a high-profile management reshuffling at the Independent Commission Against Corruption</a> have provoked a response-in-kind from the opposition. If Beijing has raised the stakes, then Hong Kong voters appear to have seen the bet and raised it.</p> <p>It means the next Legco session promises more explosive battles between the opposition and the government, led by the unpopular chief executive, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/feb/19/be-like-sheep-wolf-of-hong-kong-cy-leung-tells-citizens\">CY Leung</a>. At the same time, the cracks within the pro-democracy camp will likely bring more confrontation between the pan-dem old-timers and the vocal youth. All that is expected to engender deeper fractures and further polarisation inside and outside of Legco, culminating in yet another political showdown when it comes to the chief executive\u2019s re-election bid next spring.</p> <p>For now, the opposition is celebrating, happy to have retained the one-third voting bloc necessary to veto critical bills that require super-majority approval; examples have included an anti-subversion law and electoral changes favourable to the ruling elite. </p> <p>As the cheers die down, however, the vicious attacks among the opposition will resume, as the lines continue to blur between friends and foes, allies and adversaries.</p> <p><em>Jason Y Ng is a Hong Kong-based columnist and author of Umbrellas in Bloom: Hong Kong\u2019s occupy movement uncovered</em></p>",

  "<p>When you want to hook your headphones up to your smartphone you could soon find yourself searching for a non-existent socket if certain manufacturers \u2013 including possibly even Apple \u2013 get their way.</p> <p>The sad thing is, the headphone jack \u2013 that 3.5mm analogue three or four pole plug \u2013 is a very good connector. It\u2019s a universal connector: it can plug into your smartphone, your tablet and computer, your TV, hi-fi, radio, Game Boy or console. And it has been used widely for decades, more or less replacing the larger 1/4-inch jacks (which dated from the 1870s) since the 1960s for all but specialist applications, such as electric guitars and some more powerful amps.</p> <p>As smartphones have become the primary music device for a whole generation and more, most headphones spend the majority of their time plugged into these pocket computers. But now the jack\u2019s dominance is being contested.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"119fe826d0423e08e22259e48f2a0f522302ea99\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/119fe826d0423e08e22259e48f2a0f522302ea99/94_60_1843_1106/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Moto Z\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Lenovo Moto Z, with no 3.5mm socket to be seen.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Motorola</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Several smartphone manufacturers have started shipping handsets without 3.5mm sockets. Lenovo\u2019s new modular <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jun/10/lenovo-smartphone-terminator-vision-project-tango\">Moto Z shirks</a> the headphone socket for a dongle that\u2019s plugged into the relatively new USB-C socket in the bottom. China\u2019s LeEco also dumped the socket, while chip giant Intel is actively encouraging others to kill off the analogue 3.5mm socket in favour of USB-C.</p> <p>But it is arguably Apple, which is strongly rumoured to be planning to dump the 3.5mm standard at its iPhone 7 launch on Wednesday, that will likely have the largest impact on the market, particularly given the world\u2019s largest smartphone manufacturer, Samsung, has continued to fit the socket to its smartphones.</p> <p>Why would Apple dump the handy, helpful, user-friendly headphone jack? There are several reasons. The Lightning port in the bottom of an iPhone is already capable of outputting audio, and is needed for power, so if one of the two has to go to save a little bit of space, the 3.5mm jack gets the boot.</p> <p>That port also gives Apple much more control over accessories, as to use it you might have to apply for a licence and certification from Apple under its so-called Made for iPhone (MFi) scheme.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"893bab8f8ab8645b39343e79f61b57ef28f90e14\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/893bab8f8ab8645b39343e79f61b57ef28f90e14/0_103_5184_3110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"apple lightning port\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Is the Lightning connector Apple\u2019s one port to rule them all?</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>All recent iPhones, iPads and iPod touches have a Lightning port for charging and it can output audio, video or data, whatever is needed, using various different cables. For listening to a smartphone it works just like a 3.5mm jack would, except it\u2019s purely digital. Plug your Lightning connector in and hit play.</p> <p>The trouble is, you can\u2019t plug Lightning headphones into anything else. Not even Macs have Lightning ports, and you can forget about hooking them up to a stereo or similar. For that reason, the current crop of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jun/11/philips-fidelio-m2l-review-lightning-connector-headphones-apple\">Lightning-only headphones aren\u2019t great</a>.</p> <p>But the Lightning connector isn\u2019t the only technology gunning for the headphone jack.</p> <p>USB-C is another contender for the headphone throne. It\u2019s new, which means not many devices currently have the sockets except a collection of Android smartphones and a few tablets, but computers, including Apple\u2019s MacBook, do have the new USB-C standard. That means a pair of USB-C headphones can be used in more than just a smartphone, even if there\u2019s very little chance of being able to plug them into a stereo or similar any time soon.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"839bb02d1076f38327e60d0525650fc65a3ba868\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/839bb02d1076f38327e60d0525650fc65a3ba868/0_0_2100_1260/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Apple MacBook\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Apple MacBook and its USB-C charging and data cable.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Apple</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>USB-C, like Lightning, also has an audio quality advantage. They both carry digital audio directly to the headphones, which means there\u2019s no loss of quality caused by the smartphone\u2019s digital-to-analogue converter (Dac). If the music sounds poor with a pure digital stream to your ears, it\u2019s the headphone\u2019s fault.</p> <p>If you\u2019re ditching the standard 3.5mm cable, however, there\u2019s already a well established technology that doesn\u2019t need a new connector: Bluetooth. Wireless headphones are nothing new, but in the last three years they\u2019ve gone from lumbering, heavy over-ear beasts with poor battery life to headphones, earphones and even just buds that last anywhere from a few hours to a few days between charges.</p> <p>Over-ear and on-ear Bluetooth headphones are the most popular and are almost indistinguishable from their cabled siblings. Most also have the option of plugging in a headphones cable for connecting to non-Bluetooth devices or for using them when the battery runs out.</p> <p>In-ear Bluetooth headphones are less common, but come in several types: neck-phones with a plastic collar that sits on your shoulders, wireless earbuds connected by a short cable that sits around the back of your neck, or a new breed of truly wireless earbuds that are not physically connected to each other.</p> <p>While the first two are established and work well, despite the neck phones defeating the object of being wireless, the truly independent wireless earbuds are still a work in progress, suffering connectivity and battery life issues.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"20663b4cf6437abafd75e31ed6cc6965306372fb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/20663b4cf6437abafd75e31ed6cc6965306372fb/0_625_3840_4622/831.jpg\" alt=\"moto z\" width=\"831\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Is yet another dongle or adapter in your future.

But dongles suck, getting in the way, offering another thing to lose or to break and run the risk of damaging the one thing your phone cannot live without \u2013 the power socket \u2013 if bent or ripped out.</p> <p>None of the options are as simple and compatible as the humble 3.5mm headphone jack, and while wireless headphones are certainly more convenient, most still use the 3.5mm connector as a fall back. The removal of that standard connector must be compensated with something as good, if not better, otherwise there really is no benefit to the consumer.</p> <ul> <li><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jun/21/bose-qc35-wireless-bluetooth-noise-cancelling-headphones-review\">Bose QC35 wireless headphones: simply unrivalled noise cancelling</a><br></strong></li> <li><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/mar/15/marshall-major-ii-bluetooth-headphones-battery-life-sound-wireless\">Marshall Major II Bluetooth headphones: they last for ages and sound great too</a><br></strong></li> <li><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/apr/06/sony-hear-on-wireless-nc-headphones-review-just-shy-of-really-great\">Sony h.ear on Wireless NC headphones review: just shy of really great</a></strong><br></li> <li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/nov/04/plantronics-backbeat-sense-review-light-long-lasting-great-sounding-bluetooth-headphones\"><strong>Plantronics BackBeat Sense review: light, long-lasting and great sounding Bluetooth headphones</strong></a></li> </ul>",

This week\u2019s poem is by the Truro-born, London-based Irish poet Maura Dooley and is from her latest Bloodaxe collection <a href=\"http://www.bloodaxebooks.com/ecs/product/the-silvering-1108\">The Silvering</a>: spring-published and often full of that season\u2019s luminosity. Like many poems in the collection, In a dream she meets him again has a sense of natural, weather-y, precarious beauty.</p> <p> It\u2019s a poem with a narrative, though, not a static lyric, and belongs to a trio which Dooley, when <a href=\"http://poetrylondon.co.uk/playing-with-light-and-time-maura-dooley-talks-to-karen-mccarthy-woolf/\">interviewed</a> by Karen McCarthy Woolf for Poetry London, described as \u201cthat little run of dream poems\u201d. In a dream she meets him again is the first of the three. It is like the opening bud of a short story that contains little seeds of the plot, and yet has a perfectly satisfying shape of its own. The other two are called In a dream she encounters a snag and In a dream he is still busy: you may guess there\u2019s a certain decline of hope in the narrative (but for the full story, you will need to buy the book).</p> <p> I like the quick, film-like movement of this poem, the focus-shifts from the leaves to the face to the river to the sunset to the glass. Wind-shaken leaves catch the external light differently, but it\u2019s \u201cthis loveliest of springs\u201d which is the subject described as \u201clit from within\u201d. Some transforming illumination has occurred inside the central character, the unnamed young woman whose narrative point of view the poem adopts. </p> <p> Whatever it is, the enchantment occupies both the characters, of course. Adolescence, champagne, the future? Or a dizzy combination, perhaps. The boy is tilting his glass \u201cat a book or film, at life itself\u201d. Perhaps he has just received a brilliant set of exam results? </p> <p> Yet something seems not quite settled between the couple. She may be enchanted by him: he is looking away. Although his glance \u201cfinds hers\u201d, his glass (notice the tantalising \u201cnot-quite\u201d of that glance/glass rhyme) is tilted in another direction: she\u2019s not the object of the toast. And later on in the poem, we\u2019re told (now in the past tense) that \u201cshe almost had his name\u201d. She has forgotten it, then! Or is she teasing?</p> <p> Perhaps the radiance bathing the poem is purely the cinematic light of the dream. The title reminds us that this is not really happening. It may have happened once, only differently. Dreams can excavate memories, although they often revise them. Spring-memories revisited in a middle-aged, autumnal dream may be sharpened or blunted by the dreamer\u2019s subliminal awareness of their unattainability. </p> <p> Opacity increases, even as typography extends the power of the visual. First, we imagine the bubbles; then, we actually see them: \u201cO, o, she almost had his name.\u201d Significant, too, is the auditory drama enacted by the not-fully contextualised exclamation. It\u2019s not a sceptical \u201cuh-oh\u201d, but a gasp of pleasure, I think. And yet there\u2019s a tiny, sardonic ring to it. Surprise and uncertainty are present, too. It\u2019s a moment of revelation for the speaker \u2013 but of what? Are those circular marks little wounds in the dream fabric? Questions, questions \u2026</p> <p> The poem\u2019s only direct question, \u201cRemember me?\u201d is the boy\u2019s. Wily, the narrator ducks away from it. \u201cMaybe she does\u201d could be a flirtatious \u201cyes\u201d, but, again, a great deal can be read into the hesitation, the narrator\u2019s unwillingness to let us see into her character\u2019s mind. \u201cMaybe she does\u201d but maybe she doesn\u2019t. If she\u2019s pretending not to remember, why is she? The woman in the poem seems to have two identities, as often happens to someone dreaming: you\u2019re a past self but also, somehow, the same person who fell asleep a few hours ago. In the poem, it\u2019s as if there\u2019s a double-remove, two veils which shimmer faintly and differently. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2016/aug/08/poem-of-the-week-ifs-by-caroline-norton\">Poem of the week: Ifs by Caroline Norton</a> </p> </aside>  <p> From being emotionally unguarded (we know how delighted and blessed the dreamer feels because of those phrases \u201cloveliest of springs\u201d and \u201cfresh glance\u201d) the narrative turns secretive. The woman is caught at a trembling, high-wire moment which leaves her oddly composed and, perhaps, enjoying the height of her power in this relationship.</p> <p> In the interview mentioned above, Dooley shares her dislike of being described, once, as a miniaturist. This is certainly inadequate, in view of her range and her political thrust. But the fact is that Dooley does possess an unusual boldness and artistry in the medium of the short lyric.

  "<p>I didn\u2019t realise I had a mental health problem. I\u2019m a GP and it\u2019s a common misconception that we don\u2019t get them. We get stressed, of course. We get burnout \u2013 yes. But we don\u2019t get mental health problems.</p> <p>When I found myself working in a practice hit, like so many others, by the lack of GPs and nurses of course it was difficult. Spending days as the only doctor for 8,500 patients was horrific. On-call days started early with visits that were left over from earlier in the week because we hadn\u2019t had enough doctors to go out. There was a list of patients to call back before the phone lines even opened, booked in by the receptionists because they had nowhere else to put them. Blood results to look at. Medication queries to answer. Letters to read and file. Repeat prescriptions to sign. Complaints letters to respond to. Care Quality Commission boxes to tick. </p> <p>It was never ending. Somehow, in the middle of all this, I was expected to try and make a quiet calm, caring bubble with each patient for ten minutes. I was meant to put all this out of my mind and focus only on them. It\u2019s what they deserved and it\u2019s what I wanted to do. But I couldn\u2019t.</p> <p>Medicine is a busy job. General practice is a busy job. I never expected to have quiet days. But when arriving at 7am, and leaving at 11pm isn\u2019t enough \u2013 what is? The constant pressure and the never-ending demands on my time got to me. I wanted to be a good doctor for my patients, and a good colleague to the staff who were all struggling. I pushed myself because that\u2019s what we do. It didn\u2019t matter that I hadn\u2019t stopped to eat, drink, go to the toilet \u2013 as long as I was doing the job that was all that counted. </p> <p>But what I couldn\u2019t see was that I wasn\u2019t doing the job. I was nowhere near being the doctor I wanted to be. I was so tired, I couldn\u2019t concentrate. I had to double check everything I prescribed in case I\u2019d made a mistake. I sat and filed hundreds of blood results like a robot. Clicking \u201cnormal\u201d over and over again but not realising my brain could well be missing something important. My judgment went out of the window. My referral rates went up. I did blood tests on everyone because I couldn\u2019t think through what was wrong with them. I thought I was being stoic, carrying on. I couldn\u2019t admit to myself that actually I wasn\u2019t safe. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/healthcare-network/views-from-the-nhs-frontline/2014/sep/15/burnout-gp-nhs\">I faced burnout working as a GP in the NHS \u2013 I had to stop</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I ignored all the signs \u2013 sleepless nights, early morning waking, overeating, drinking too much, no enjoyment in anything, dreading the next day.

  "<p>The figure of Judas, the apostle who betrayed Jesus, has been explored and exploited many times over 2,000 years, seldom emerging with any credit. Medieval Christianity, for example, turned him into the archetypal Jew and used his example to justify its own murderous antisemitism. But are traitors always bad?</p> <p>That is the question posed by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2009/feb/14/amos-oz-interview\">Amos Oz</a>, Israel\u2019s best-known novelist, perpetually mentioned as a candidate for the Nobel prize for literature. <em>Judas </em>combines an exploration of the motivation of the renegade apostle (over which the gospels are decidedly muddled) and what he calls a story of \u201cerror, desire [and] unrequited love\u201d, set in Oz\u2019s native Jerusalem in the winter of 1959.</p> <p>The link between the two strands is young, sensitive Shmuel Ash, a student who has dropped out of university. He takes a live-in job as companion to an elderly, incapacitated man, Gershom Wald, who unattractively needs someone with whom to argue. Sharing the gloomy house, heavy with unspoken history, is Atalia Abravanel, a sensual, mysterious woman in her 40s, who it emerges is Wald\u2019s daughter-in-law.</p> <p>Shmuel falls in love with her in what becomes a tender coming-of-age tale; Wald, meanwhile, encourages his young helper to rekindle his studies on Jewish views on Jesus. That leads him naturally enough into an exploration of the character of Judas.</p> <p>The Judas that takes shape is a spy, sent by the Jewish authorities, to infiltrate the inner circle of Jesus, a preacher in distant Galilee who has attracted an enthusiastic following with his miracles and his reinterpretation of what it means to follow God. But Judas goes native, and becomes the most ardent believer in Jesus\u2019s divinity, more so than the man himself. It is, therefore, Judas who encourages Jesus to take his message to Jerusalem, and Judas who presses the chief priest to have Jesus crucified, believing he will rise from the dead on the cross. When Jesus doesn\u2019t, Judas recognises himself as potentially the first and the last Christian and, in despair, takes his own life by hanging himself from a tree.</p> <p>This was treachery in a good cause. It is not a new idea. As early as the 14th century, Saint Vincent Ferrer, a celebrated Dominican preacher close to the papacy, was pointing out that if Jesus was truly God\u2019s son, come to Earth to redeem humankind, then his betrayal had to be part of God\u2019s plan. Judas was therefore doing God\u2019s business, not the devil\u2019s.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"2a60054363715aeda011d5fd73a7b212e23b4bb6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2a60054363715aeda011d5fd73a7b212e23b4bb6/0_459_2747_3432/800.jpg\" alt=\"Israeli writer Amos Oz.

The author\u2019s political views have led other Israelis to accuse him of being a traitor.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>What gives Oz\u2019s rereading of Judas such power, however, is how he juxtaposes it with the story that Atalia reluctantly reveals to Shmuel about her own recently dead father, Shealtiel Abravanel. He had been the only member of the Zionist executive committee to oppose David Ben-Gurion (whom he suspected of having a messianic complex) over the foundation of the state of Israel in 1948.</p> <p>Abravanel had developed close links with the local Arab population and advocated instead that Jews and Arabs should live side by side as equals in a country under international control. His colleagues rejected his views, suspected him of conspiring with their enemies, forced his resignation and labelled him a traitor. Abravanel had lived out his life as a Judas, an outcast, shut away in the gloomy house. Yet, Oz suggests without ever quite saying it, he may have been right in his thinking, one of those politicians such as Churchill or even Lincoln, whose challenging, unpopular views caused them, at times, to be labeled a traitor. Their love for their country was, however, ultimately requited, while Abravanel died a prophet without honour in his own land.</p> <p>Those aware of Oz\u2019s own standing in Israel will hear echoes of the novelist himself in Abravanel. Because he has steadfastly, since 1967, advocated a two-state settlement with the Palestinians, and has robustly criticised those Israeli governments that refuse to engage with this policy, he has been dubbed a traitor by some of his fellow Israelis.</p> <p>Many-layered, thought-provoking and \u2013 in its love story \u2013 delicate as a chrysalis, this is an old-fashioned novel of ideas that is strikingly and compellingly modern.</p> <p><em>Judas is published by Chatto &amp; Windus (\u00a318.99). </em><a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/judas-443413.html\"><em>Click here to buy it for \u00a315.57</em></a></p>",

The site offers information about how Italian regions will be involved, with doctors, pharmacists and clinics available to give advice to those interested in the subject of procreation. And in four major Italian towns \u2013 Rome, Bologna, Padova and Catania \u2013 there will be events to promote fertility and discussions on the subject.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In the 1930s posters on the walls incited women to give more children to the fatherland</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In and of itself that might not have been cause for such a furore \u2013 but what has ignited anger is not just the idea of procreation as a matter for the state to intervene in, but the images associated with it: a series of photos of pregnancy, and some troubling adverts, such as one where a woman holds an hourglass to show that her biological clock ticking away.</p> <p>The reaction has been fierce, with many questioning if there is not a better way to encourage people to have children \u2013 by promoting employment policy, for example, and by helping the economy to grow more after many years of recession. Only in the last six months has Italy started to recover from a long period of economic trouble. But growth is slow and unemployment is still very high \u2013 <a href=\"http://uk.businessinsider.com/italys-youth-unemployment-just-hit-a-new-record-high-heres-whats-going-wrong-2015-7\">over 40%</a> \u2013 among the under-25s.</p> <p>It\u2019s that age group that also feels put out .

Why should they be discriminated against? The recent law on civil unions approved by the Italian parliament a few weeks ago gave many the impression that the state had finally accepted a broader idea of the family, but now this campaign puts the emphasis back on discrimination. Women are targeted by this fertility campaign, as if they were the only people responsible for the declining birthrate that has been affecting Italy for many years.</p> <p>It all sounds so similar to the fascist slogans of the 1930s, when posters on the walls incited women to give more children to the fatherland. Many cannot believe that a female minister has launched such a sexist, ageist, anachronistic campaign in a country where many other urgent problems remain to be addressed.</p>",

  "<p>As the presidential election enters the home stretch, Donald Trump\u2019s campaign is in a vulnerable position. In recent weeks, the Republican nominee has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/26/steve-bannon-florida-registered-vote-donald-trump\">changed key aides</a> yet again, flip-flopped on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/04/donald-tump-immigration-mixed-messages-republicans\">his signature issue of immigration</a> and stayed well behind Hillary Clinton in fundraising, organization and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/29/donald-trump-nascar-north-carolina-republicans\">polling</a>.</p> <p>Trump is by no means out of the race, but his path to victory relies as much on Clinton missteps as on his own successes. That means he now has a clear goal. He is not going to try to be a normal candidate. There will be no attempt to pivot to the center. There will not be a softer side. </p> <p>Trump will be the same fiery demagogue that tore up the Republican primary. The goal will not be to dam his torrent of political incorrectness. It will be to channel it, to produce maximum appeal to voters.</p> <p>The biggest change in the Trump campaign in recent weeks was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/19/paul-manafort-resigns-donald-trump-campaign\">the replacement</a> of top aide Paul Manafort with a two-headed team, pollster Kellyanne Conway as campaign manager and rightwing publisher Steve Bannon as campaign CEO. The two took over in mid-August, after a series of revelations about Manafort\u2019s ties to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/16/donald-trump-campaign-paul-manafort-ukraine-yanukovich\">allies of Russian president Vladimir Putin</a>. </p> <p>A veteran of Republican campaigns since 1976, Manafort was brought on to help guide the campaign through the arcane process of delegate selection for the Republican convention in Cleveland. He was then able to push out Corey Lewandowski, Trump\u2019s previous campaign manager, who was known for his brash, hard-charging style. </p> <p>Manafort is known for his charisma, but he was not able to bring it to bear on Trump. Before the billionaire clinched the nomination, Manafort <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/apr/21/trump-campaign-republican-establishment-election-strategy\">promised top Republicans</a> his candidate was putting on \u201can act\u201d for primary voters. Trump was reportedly furious, and therefore did his utmost to demonstrate that he was just being himself.</p> <p>Trump subsequently meandered from controversy to controversy, a situation not helped by the fact that unlike Lewandowski, Manafort did not travel with him. It is almost unheard for campaign managers to travel with their candidate, but no candidate in American history has been so impulsive as Trump. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/03/citizens-united-david-bossie-trump-campaign\">Trump's new hire David Bossie has decades-long history attacking Clintons</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The result?

As a result, the campaign\u2019s brains trust, which also includes Trump\u2019s son-in-law <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/05/jared-kushner-new-york-observer-jewish-antisemitism\">Jared Kushner</a>, has no experience working for a presidential candidate in a general election. It is however well-attuned to Trump\u2019s idiosyncratic ways.</p> <p>One of the biggest changes is that Trump now uses a teleprompter when speaking, even at his raucous campaign rallies. Although he has long disdained the device and boasted of his ability to improvise every night, thanks to the arrival of Conway he has finally been persuaded to stick to something resembling a script. </p> <p>No one, of course, should mistake Trump for an automaton. He uses his prepared remarks in the same way John Coltrane used the sheet music to My Favorite Things: as the basis for a series of wild riffs. But the presence of the teleprompter means that Trump at least gets back to the basic notes, rather than off on a politically costly solo.</p> <p>The most glaring sign Trump\u2019s new reliance on technology came at the end of August, at an Iowa fundraiser for Senator Joni Ernst that was held in a barn on the state fairgrounds, where livestock normally compete for blue ribbons. Politician after politician took the stage to cheers from crowd sitting on benches on the dirt floor, wolfing down barbecued pork sandwiches. As Trump\u2019s appearance drew near, technicians suddenly appeared and installed a teleprompter. At such an informal event, it was a jarring site.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d9ec5297b1d66276248bc101c1f8a915d5d659bb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d9ec5297b1d66276248bc101c1f8a915d5d659bb/0_319_5200_3119/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Donald Trump Attends Joni Ernst\u2019s Annual Roast And Ride In Des Moines\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Donald Trump speaks from a teleprompter at the 2nd annual Joni Ernst Roast and Ride in Des Moines last month.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stephen Maturen/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In terms of policy, the candidate has returned to the \u201clet Trump be Trump\u201d tactics that defined his campaign in the primary. This was most clear in his immigration speech in Phoenix on Wednesday, where Trump definitely took a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/01/donald-trump-vows-to-deport-millions-during-first-hour-in-office-in-hardline-speech\">hardline stance</a>, doubling down on the inflammatory rhetoric that drove his surge to the nomination. </p> <p>Proclaiming \u201cthere will be no amnesty\u201d, parading family members of Americans killed by illegal immigrants, he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/01/in-arizona-we-saw-the-real-donald-trump-the-one-we-already-knew\">framed the issue</a> not as \u201ca humanitarian crisis\u201d, as he said earlier that day in Mexico, or even an economic one. Instead, it was about public safety and the \u201cwellbeing of the American people\u201d.</p> <p>In the aftermath of a speech that showed little potential to improve poll numbers among Latino voters, a number of members of Trump\u2019s Hispanic advisory council resigned. A recent poll showed <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/trailguide/la-na-trailguide-updates-1472827916-htmlstory.html\">only 19% of Hispanics</a> supporting Trump. In 2004, George W Bush won 44%. In one recent poll, Trump\u2019s approval rating among African Americans was <a href=\"http://fusion.net/story/341993/trump-public-policy-polling-0-percent/\">zero</a>. To win, he will have to run the table with white voters.</p> <p>Trump does appeal to disconnected blue-collar white voters. While diverse states like Colorado and Virginia, swing states in past cycles, have moved off the map, Trump is showing staying power in places such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/28/donald-trump-iowa-republican-red-state\">Iowa</a> and Nevada, which have recently leaned Democratic. The problem is that those states have comparatively few votes in the electoral college.

Over the course of the last six years, skills provision has been quietly decimated, and although the government <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2015/nov/25/further-education-sector-budget-protect-spending-review\" title=\"\">pulled back</a> from taking the axe to budgets again in last November\u2019s spending review, I fear that this next round of cuts might be the final nail in the coffin.</p> <p>Large numbers of apprenticeship-providers have already warned that they will be forced to cut back or even withdraw provision altogether, as their programmes will simply no longer be financially viable. This clearly undermines the government\u2019s pledge to <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/government-kick-starts-plans-to-reach-3-million-apprenticeships\" title=\"\">create 3 million apprenticeships by 2020</a>. The government will continue to point to this target as evidence of progress, but this is actually about quality as well as quantity.</p> <p>The providers that do manage to survive will have to pare programmes back to the bone, and will not be able to provide the sort of rigorous, high quality-programmes that will equip our young people with the technical skills that they, businesses and our economy so desperately need.</p> <p>Youth unemployment is already worryingly high at 13.7%, and well over <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/may/25/more-youngsters-shut-out-of-work-or-training-study-finds\" title=\"\">1 million 16- to 24-year-olds</a> are not in education, training or employment during any six-month period. The skills gap and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/apr/25/growth-uk-productivity-crisis\" title=\"\">productivity crisis</a> holding back Britain\u2019s businesses and economy are both well-documented and of serious concern. Surely the government can appreciate how closely apprenticeships and further education more generally ties into its own stated objectives of a dynamic, modern economy that \u201cworks not for a privileged few, but for every one of us\u201d?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/sep/04/uk-apprenticeship-funding-rethink-attacked-labour\">UK apprenticeship funding changes attacked by Labour</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Education and training for over-16s is not just an add-on for the millions of young people who do not follow the neat linear trajectory from school to university \u2013 it equips people who are not well-suited to academia with the skills that can transform their life chances. There are very few areas of government policy in which public investment directly leads to such a large dividend in terms of increasing social mobility.</p> <p>These cuts represent everything that is wrong and unjust about the Conservative government\u2019s pursuance of an austerity agenda: it is the poorest, the most-disadvantaged and those who most need support who suffer the greatest. That\u2019s why more than <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/sep/04/uk-apprenticeship-funding-rethink-attacked-labour\" title=\"\">50 Labour MPs have written to the apprenticeships and skills minister Robert Halfon</a> calling on him to reverse these misguided cuts.</p> <p>On the steps of Downing Street, <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/statement-from-the-new-prime-minister-theresa-may\" title=\"\">Theresa May promised</a> to \u201chelp anybody, whatever your background, go as far as your talents will take you\u201d.

  "<p>Darren Sarll may be the youngest manager in the Football League but some of his views come straight from the old school. The Stevenage manager made sure his players trained \u201charder and for longer\u201d last week and the result, a 6-1 win over Hartlepool, suggests his traditional methods may just be worthwhile at a club where, for now, survival represents success.</p> <p>On Saturday Sarll\u2019s team fought back from going a goal behind against a dismal Hartlepool to earn not only their second win of the season but also record their biggest home victory in the league. They have gone one better on the road, putting half a dozen without reply past Yeovil in April 2012. Cruelly, Hartlepool\u2019s midfielder Michael Woods was on the opposing side at Huish Park too.</p> <p>And, really, Stevenage could have added a few more. The manner in which Hartlepool threw in the towel midway through the second half should cause their manager, Craig Hignett, much cause for concern but Stevenage\u2019s transformation within the game from anxiety after falling behind, following a defensive calamity, to supreme confidence by the end was quite impressive.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/sep/03/football-league-your-thoughts-afc-wimbledon-claim-first-win-luton-top-league-two\">Football League your thoughts: AFC Wimbledon claim first win, Luton top League Two</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cAugust is now history and September is our world,\u201d Sarll wrote in his programme notes. The form guide and early exchanges suggested that was a tad optimistic but by full-time the 33-year-old wore an expression of delight.</p> <p>Stevenage had endured a dismal week, conceding five at Grimsby before succumbing at Leyton Orient in the EFL Cup. Nobody saw such a winning margin coming. Even Sarll, who is being assisted by Glenn Roeder, seemed quite surprised. \u201cIt was a long time coming,\u201d he said before sagely preaching that one big win does not make a season. \u201cThis time last Saturday I was in a completely different emotional place.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve had some real in-depth meetings this week to discuss absolutely everything. But I\u2019ve said to the players let\u2019s not get our heads among the clouds here. Things are still not right, the balance and play is not right. We made necessary tweaks last week, and we will make necessary tweaks this week for next Saturday. But it\u2019s a good way to start September.\u201d</p> <p>While the results were gravely concerning \u2013 a win and a draw from five league games \u2013 the final moments of August may be marked as crucial. Deadline day in League Two is aeons away from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/sep/01/premier-league-billion-pound-spenders-transfer-window\">billionaire boys club of the Premier League</a>. Sarll spent the final moments of the window trying everything to bolster his squad and on this evidence, the loan signing of Tyler Walker from Nottingham Forest looks like a fantastic piece of work.</p> <p>Walker, a rapid and lean striker recently hampered by injuries, scored twice and could have had a hat-trick if Michael Tonge had not demanded to take a penalty in the 69th minute. The teenager\u2019s body language as the veteran midfielder dispatched low to the left of the unfortunate Adam Bartlett said plenty about his disappointment, although he did make certain to congratulate Tonge for his goal. He also missed a one-on-one two minutes later, before being substituted to a standing ovation.</p> <p>The 19-year-old\u2019s first, to put Stevenage in front a minute before the interval, after Tom Pett equalised on the counter, was a wonderful overhead kick and his second, making it 4-1, was executed with notable confidence. \u201cLong may it continue,\u201d Sarll said.</p> <p>Dean Wells and Matt Godden scored the others, and it will be of little consolation to Bartlett that without him Stevenage could have racked up double figures.</p> <p>Boro\u2019s other debutant, Kgosi Ntlhe, acquitted himself well at left-back, though was fortunate to remain on the pitch after a nasty tackle on Jordan Richards 11 minutes before half-time, sliding in high after losing control of possession. He escaped with a yellow card from the referee, John Busby, a recent promotion from the National League where his record suggested a penchant for flashing red.</p> <p>Sarll was impressed by the 22-year-old South African, signed from Peterborough hours before the deadline. \u201cI was delighted to get him in because since [Scott] Laird was here [in 2012] we haven\u2019t had a top quality left-back, but on the whole he knows more hard work is to come,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cIt has taken us a while to learn and evolve but today was a clear indication that we are trying to get better,\u201d the manager added.</p> <p>They may not achieve a more convincing win all season but if Stevenage can continue to attack with such verve, staying in the league should be no problem.\u2022 The Hartlepool manager, Craig Hignett, could not hold back on his team\u2019s shortcomings in Hertfordshire, though his players were not shying away from the embarrassment by apologetically applauding the disgruntled travelling supporters at full-time. Several made their feelings known at the end \u2013 and they had a right to after a 450-mile round trip. \u201cIt was painful to watch,\u201d said Hignett. \u201cBut what can I say after that, it was embarrassing, I\u2019m struggling to find the words to sum it up.\u201d Embarrassing was his word of the day \u2013 adding that the \u201cschoolboy\u201d manner in which they defended for every goal left them repeatedly red-faced.</p> <h2>Talking points</h2> <p>\u2022 In League One the result of the weekend was AFC Wimbledon\u2019s first in the division, coming against Chesterfield thanks to Dom Poleon\u2019s 91st-minute winner. And that was probably made all the sweeter by MK Dons falling apart against their local rivals Northampton in startling fashion early-on, though they did fight back to make it 3-2. Yet perhaps the most startling statistic of the weekend is that Northampton, last season\u2019s runaway League 2 champions, are now unbeaten in 30 league games.</p> <p>\u2022 With 25 minutes to go at Priestfield on Sunday, the former Northampton manager, Chris Wilder, may have been pondering if his departure from Sixfields at the end of last season was the right call, but Sheffield United came from a goal down to beat Gillingham, thanks to a last-minute penalty, and ensure they are not in the relegation places. But what is the minimum Blades fans will accept in May? It should be a play-off place at the very least.</p> <p>\u2022 Luton not only lead the way in League Two but they are also the highest scorers in the Football League with 14. A lot of that is down to Danny Hylton, whose hat-trick went a long way to beating Wycombe on Saturday. He has five from six and had big plans for celebrating afterwards. \u201cI\u2019ll go back to three kids, my wife\u2019s going out. It will probably be playing Nerf guns or something and then fall asleep about nine o\u2019clock.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 The deluge that descended upon Rodney Parade on Saturday, forcing Newport\u2019s game with Barnet to be abandoned after 45 minutes with the visitors leading 1-0, brings to mind other early-season waterlogged pitch fiascos. From recent memory, Charlton had a home game against Doncaster in the Championship postponed on 24 August 2013 \u2013 with the away team livid because they led 3-0. But what has been the earliest abandonment due to the weather (in a season, not minutes)? Answers by post, or, er, below the line.</p>",
  "<p>Amat Escalante is the director who made a considerable splash at Cannes in 2013 with Heli, a brutal slice of working-class life in narcoterrorist Mexico, which won him the best director award. Now Escalante is back with a follow-up, The Untamed \u2013 though its original title is La Regi\u00f3n Salvaje (The Savage Region), which seems to fit its mysterious, elliptical narrative a little better.</p> <p>Escalante\u2019s film begins by pitching us into a knotty, but not immediately unlikely, drama of family dysfunction in a small Mexican town. Ale is unhappy with her boringly macho husband Angel; he\u2019s got a decent job, with a surveying crew, but is secretly cheating on Ale with \u2013 of all people \u2013 her doctor brother Fabian. (Angel\u2019s method of deflecting suspicion is to pour a stream of homophobic abuse in to Ale\u2019s ear; in true machista style it\u2019s not entirely clear that he\u2019s not entirely in earnest.) Ale is also cursed with an overbearing mother-in-law, to whom Ale is indebted for a job and from whom she must accept a proprietal interest in her two small children.</p> <p>Incrementally, Escalante\u2019s narrative begins to get surreal round the edges, largely through the agency of Veronica, a young woman who seems to have no ties but an ability to befriend people. Fabian treats her for a dog bite, and soon she persuades him to take a trip to an isolated tract of country: soon after Fabian is found naked and unconscious in a culvert, the victim of a sexual assault so severe it has rendered him comatose. Angel\u2019s illicit relationship with him is uncovered, to Ale\u2019s dismay, and he is quickly arrested.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2013/may/19/heli-director-amat-escalante-video-interview\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/3gvkm\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"1909813\"            data-video-name=\"Heli director Amat Escalante: critics are 'cowards' - video interview\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            data-video-poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/5/18/1368891804165/Film-director-Amat-Escala-005.jpg\"> <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-409105471\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/5/18/1368891804165/Film-director-Amat-Escala-005.jpg\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2013/5/18/130518HeliInterview_FromRemote-16x9.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2013/5/18/130518HeliInterview_FromRemote_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/ad/2013/5/18/130518HeliInterview_FromRemote/130518HeliInterview_FromRemote.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2013/5/18/130518HeliInterview_FromRemote_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2013/may/19/heli-director-amat-escalante-video-interview\">Heli director Amat Escalante</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>It\u2019s at this point that things get seriously freaky. Without wishing to give too much away, we quickly move into pornified body horror territory: this \u201cregion\u201d is the resting place of an extremely strange organism, apparently deposited on earth via asteroid, and which induces a sort of atavistic sexual frenzy in any nearby creatures. (One spectacularly odd shot features a whole selection of farm animals rutting together in a giant pit.) Suffice to say, it messes Ale and Angel\u2019s family dynamics up even more, to the point of irretrievability. </p> <p>Throughout all this, Escalante retains his washed-out, low-key shooting style: occasionally the frame appears so muddy it\u2019s hard to make out exactly what is going on. Escalante also appears to have appropriated some of the style tics of fellow Mexican director Carlos Reygadas, though in truth The Untamed falls some way short of Reygadas\u2019 rich stew of imagery. What Escalante has contrived is, however, eye-popping enough; but in all honesty The Untamed doesn\u2019t seem to go anywhere special. But connoisseurs of oddness may cherish it.</p>",

  "<p>Weathered, mottled, and missing several teeth, the skull of a carpenter from the Mary Rose is a poignant sight. </p> <p>A long, wiggling suture can be seen across the crown where the bones fused as the man aged. If you gaze deep into an empty eye-socket, inner fissures can be seen. This is death, up close and personal. </p> <p>But it is also digital. Part of an ambitious online project, launching today, the skull is an interactive 3D model of physical remains recovered from the wreck of Henry VIII\u2019s great flagship, which sank during the Battle of the Solent in 1545.</p> <p>Named <a href=\"http://www.virtualtudors.org/\">Virtual Tudors</a>, and produced from a collaboration between Swansea University, the Mary Rose Trust and Oxford University, the website will host 10 other virtual skulls for academics worldwide to analyse. The goal, the team say, is to assess whether experts can glean as much from such \u2018digital remains\u2019 as the real thing: if so, it would allow many more researchers to analyse such finds and draw insights from them - from an individual\u2019s age and sex to the diseases they experienced.</p> <p>But it isn\u2019t only academics who are able to explore the virtual skulls: in a separate public section, the carpenter\u2019s skull will be available for everyone to examine, together with similar rotatable, high-resolution 3D images of a selection of the carpenter\u2019s tools and personal items found on board the ship, including his wood-plane and whetstone holder. The hope, the team say, is that the public section will captivate a wider audience than can be reached by through a museum alone, and bring the story of those who perished on the Mary Rose to life.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/gallery/2016/sep/05/from-the-depths-to-the-web-artefacts-of-the-mary-rose-in-pictures\">From the depths to the web: artefacts of the Mary Rose - in pictures</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201c[The ship] is a workplace for the people on board, it\u2019s a home and it\u2019s a machine and it\u2019s a warship and it\u2019s also a moment in time,\u201d said Alex Hildred, head of research and curator of human remains at the Mary Rose Trust. </p> <p>Raised in 1982, the Mary Rose has long captured the public\u2019s imagination, with the superbly-preserved artefacts offering up a host of insights into the lives of those who set sail on her - of whom only around 35 survived when the ship sank. </p> <p>Of the 500 or so crew who died, a multitude of bones including 179 skulls (all male) have been recovered. Some skulls have been attributed to men doing particular jobs, such as a gunner or cook, and form part of new displays at the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/jul/19/mary-rose-newly-decked-out-reopens-5m-makeover\">recently revamped</a> Mary Rose museum in Portsmouth.</p> <p>The remains of the supposed carpenter were found in a storeroom below the master carpenter\u2019s cabin, with a tools and a sawhorse nearby. Also found, in the doorway of the Carpenter\u2019s cabin, were the remains of dog (named Hatch by researchers) that would have been in charge of rodent control. \u201cThe closet genetic affinity is with the Jack Russell, but with some whippet and greyhound within it as well,\u201d said Hildred.</p> <p>A strong man between 30 and 40 years old, and around 5ft 7in tall, the carpenter, says Hildred, suffered from a number of complaints, including arthritis in his spine, ribs and left collarbone and a large - and likely very painful - abscess in his jaw. \u201cHe had a wound, possibly a scar from perhaps fighting or something, that goes across his forehead,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Accessible online to the public, the team hope that the carpenter\u2019s skull and artefacts will capture the imagination of the all who view them. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>But Virtual Tudors is also an experiment. While museums worldwide are embracing the burgeoning trend for capturing collections in digital form, the question remains as to whether these virtual objects can actually be useful for research. <br></p> <p>With the new project, the team are hoping to provide an answer, challenging bone experts around the world to scrutinise the skulls and complete questionnaires on their osteological observations, as well as sharing information about the type of device they are viewing the virtual skulls on. <br></p> <p> \u201cWe will take those results from around the world and try and compare them to a study we did when people looked at the real remains,\u201d said Richard Johnston, materials scientist and engineer from Swansea University. <br></p> <p>A skull, the team add, can offer a number of insights. \u201cYou can estimate the sex of an individual, you can estimate the ancestry of an individual and you can certainly diagnose the pathology of an individual: things like scurvy and a number of other conditions,\u201d said Nick Owen, a sport and exercise biomechanist also from Swansea University.</p> <p>At the heart of the project is a technique known as photogrammetry. For each of the skulls, around 120 high resolution photographs were painstakingly taken from many different angles, with the in-focus sections digitally stitched together to produce the final, state-of-the-art, 3D models.</p> <p>The team hope the approach could help in reconstructing the skeletons of the ill-fated crew while avoiding problems of damage and contamination from handling, as well as democratising access to the bones, allowing many more to glean insights from the remains. \u201cIt has the potential to speed up science massively,\u201d said Johnston. <br></p> <p>Elizabeth Craig-Atkins, a human osteologist at Sheffield University and who was not involved in the project, is optimistic about the digital approach.</p> <p>\u201cThis idea of opening up interaction with archaeological material to a much wider audience is a really important one,\u201d she said.</p> <p>But, she adds, there are still details that are best gleaned from the physical remains themselves, including the subtleties of surface texture and colour that could hint at a particular disease, as well as the need for physical remains in order to take samples for DNA or conduct structural analysis.</p>",

  "<p>One of the country\u2019s biggest childcare charities, which provided thousands of low-income families with nursery, after-school clubs and parenting services, has collapsed.</p> <p>4Children, which was the government\u2019s official Early Years strategic partner, went into administration after a rapid corporate expansion fuelled by private loans unravelled in the face of government cuts. </p> <p>Charity leaders blamed the collapse of 4Children, a respected and nationally recognised charity, on an increasingly tight financial environment for charities delivering council-funded services and described it as a a warning sign to ministers about the sustainability of children\u2019s services in a competitive public sector marketplace.</p> <p>Kathy Evans, the chief executive of <a href=\"http://www.childrenengland.org.uk/\">Children England</a>, which represents children\u2019s charities, said the closure of one of the sector\u2019s biggest names had surprised many. She said: \u201cThe serious financial fragility of the children\u2019s services \u2018marketplace\u2019 is a very real and urgent problem, for large and small organisations alike.\u201d</p> <p>Imelda Redmond, who was brought into 4Children as chief executive just over a year ago, said that although massive financial losses had been brought under control in recent months the board felt the charity was not viable in the long term. \u201cWhen we looked at the horizon it looked too precarious,\u201d she said.</p> <p>The rapid expansion of 4Children was overseen by Redmond\u2019s predecessor, Anne Longfield, who left 18 months ago after being <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/new-childrens-commissioner-appointed\">appointed children\u2019s commissioner</a> for England by the former education secretary Nicky Morgan.</p> <p>Longfield said in a statement on Friday: \u201cWhen I handed over the reins of 4Children after over 20 years leading it alongside an extraordinarily committed group of trustees, I considered it to be in good shape with a positive future ahead. </p> <p>\u201cTimes are tough for charities though and it\u2019s right that they work together and merge services so that they minimise risk and reduce back office spend in order to provide the best possible support in as cost-effective a way as possible, and I understand their decision to do this.\u201d</p> <p>The closure will come as a blow to the government, which needs a stable childcare market to help deliver its employment and poverty agenda. Ministers have <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/thousands-of-parents-benefit-from-30-hours-free-childcare-early\">promised to double free childcare</a> from 15 to 30 hours for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/sep/03/free-childcare-may-leave-nurseries-struggling\">working parents of three- and four-year-olds from 2017</a>. However, critics warn that childcare providers cannot afford to take on the extra demand.</p> <p>Neil Leitch, chief executive of the Pre-school Learning Alliance, said: \u201cThe collapse of [4Children] should serve as a stark reminder to government of what can happen when childcare providers are no longer able to remain financially sustainable, a challenge facing many \u2013 large and small \u2013 across the country due to a continued lack of adequate funding.\u201d</p> <p>Redmond said the impact of the closure this week was softened by a decision taken four months ago to wind down the charity in an orderly way and arrange for other organisations to take on its contracts, a process overseen by the DfE.</p> <p>As a result, all but three of its 151 different sites had moved into new ownership last week, reducing disruption to families and minimising the number of redundancies. Of 1,068 4Children staff, 46 have lost their jobs as a direct result of the collapse.</p> <p>The charity Action for Children has taken on the bulk of the contracts, which are mainly let by local authorities. Other services have been moved back under council control. </p> <p>However, the news came as a shock to parents, and <a href=\"http://www.civilsociety.co.uk/governance/news/content/22288/fundraising_and_contracting_pressures_force_closure_of_4children_with_the_loss_of_85_jobs\">angry messages</a> were left on the charity\u2019s website after families arrived at centres last week to find the doors locked. </p> <p>One parent said: \u201cYou haven\u2019t given my girls a chance to say goodbye, they will never understand why they cannot return to their nursery, a place they felt so happy. In fact, I cannot think of a more disruptive, unsettling and hurtful way you could have done this.\u201d</p> <p>All but one of those services have since found new owners and will reopen from Monday.<br></p> <p>A spokesperson for the Department for Education (DfE), which had funded 4Children to the tune of over \u00a37m during the past five years, said: \u201cWe are working closely with 4Children and Action for Children to make sure that disruption is minimised for children and families. We are confident that Action for Children will successfully deliver our work with the early years sector, and no public money will be lost as a result of this transition.\u201d</p> <p>Action for Children\u2019s managing director of operations, Carol Iddon, said changes required to sustain the services in future included the possibility of introducing or raising childcare charges. She said that although Action for Children was confident it could make the services viable, there could be no long-term guarantees. \u201cIt\u2019s a competitive market, and challenging market, and 4Children were not the only charity facing these kinds of challenges,\u201d she added.</p> <p>The demise of 4Children follows the high-profile closures of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/aug/05/kids-company-founder-camila-batmanghelidjh-confirms-charity-closure\">Kids Company</a>, and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/aug/07/leading-adoption-fostering-charity-baaf-closes-economic-problems\">adoption charity BAAF</a> in August 2015.</p> <p>Questions are being asked about the suitability of private finance in a market where council childcare spending has been cut so deeply that charities are unable to make a sufficient financial margin to repay interest on loans, despite ratcheting down costs and wages and making widespread use of zero-hours contracts for staff.</p> <p>4Children embarked on its rapid expansion plan under Longfield in 2011, more than doubling income to \u00a330m within four years after an aggressive pursuit of council contracts. \u201cIt went hell-for-leather. They were not market-averse; they had a capitalist view of how to do business,\u201d one sector insider told the Guardian.</p> <p>In October 2014, it raised \u00a31.7m in loans to fund the plan, including \u00a3700,000 from <a href=\"https://www.bigsocietycapital.com/\">Big Society Capital</a>, the body set up by former prime minister David Cameron to encourage charities delivering public services to adopt a more commercial and business-like approach to capital funding.</p> <p>HSBC bank loaned \u00a31m to 4Children as part of the deal, which was brokered by <a href=\"http://www.thefsegroup.com/\">FSE Group</a>. It was trumpeted at the time as a way of attracting investment into charities normally unable to secure private finance. FSE said the loans would promote \u201ca financially sustainable future for the charity\u201d.</p> <p>4Children declared soon after that it was \u201cnow considered as the pre-eminent children\u2019s charity\u201d. Within months, however, Longfield had left to become children\u2019s commissioner, and the charity admitted in its <a href=\"http://apps.charitycommission.gov.uk/Showcharity/RegisterOfCharities/FinancialHistory.aspx?RegisteredCharityNumber=288285&amp;SubsidiaryNumber=0\">annual accounts</a> for the year to the end of March 2015, that its financial performance was \u201cnot satisfactory\u201d. </p> <p>It had run up a \u00a33m loss on income of \u00a330m, and drained its financial reserves. \u201cEconomic conditions continue to be difficult and we have not responded as well as we would have liked to that environment, particularly in not making the savings required in delivering and supporting our services,\u201d it said.</p> <p>Cliff Prior, chief executive of Big Society Capital, said: \u201cSince 2012, Big Society Capital has made 50 investments, working with our fund managers and co-investors to bring more than \u00a3270m to over 300 charities and social enterprises. Unfortunately, not all of these organisations are successful. <br></p> <p>\u201cWe always explore how we can learn from failures and we are working to develop principles of best practice with our fund managers and co-investors.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>David Cameron seemed a little on edge. We were alone in his study in Number 10, very shortly after the formation of the coalition, and he wanted to ask me something that had clearly been preying on his mind. \u201cThis is terribly awkward,\u201d he admitted. \u201cThe thing is \u2026 George has for so long had his eye on Dorneywood\u2026 He\u2019s very close to me\u2026 Would you mind if he used Dorneywood instead of you?\u201d He then proposed that I share the foreign secretary\u2019s traditional grace-and-favour countryside retreat, Chevening, rather than Dorneywood, which was ordinarily used by the number two in government.</p> <p>I was a bit taken aback. I thought he wanted to ask me something important. It hadn\u2019t really occurred to me that I might get a retreat to use at weekends, still less that there was any great distinction between one or the other. Cameron\u2019s plea suggested that George Osborne had been measuring up the curtains for years.</p> <p>I accepted the new arrangement and found myself sharing Chevening, a grand mansion in the Kent countryside near Sevenoaks, for the next five years with the foreign secretary, first William Hague and later Philip Hammond. Not at the same time, I hasten to add; that would have been taking coalition a little too far.</p> <p>Whether or not occupying Dorneywood made any difference to anything, I couldn\u2019t say. But, like Westminster itself, many of the so-called trappings of power \u2013 grace-and-favour mansions, grand offices, ministerial Jaguars \u2013 can seem completely alien to people who have not spent their lives preparing for power. As such, it is easy to underestimate their importance.</p> <p>When it was suggested that I take an office with no publicly recognisable entrance of its own, I didn\u2019t mind, as I thought I wouldn\u2019t need an equivalent of the Number 10 door at which to receive guests. When it was decided where I would sit in the House of Commons at Prime Minister\u2019s Questions, I thought it made sense to sit supportively next to the PM, to show that the coalition could work smoothly.</p> <p>Big mistakes. All of them.</p> <p>***</p> <p>From the outside, the first day of the coalition government looked just about as smooth a transition of power as you could wish for, but behind closed doors it was anything but. With the negotiations wrapped up in just five days, the prime minister and I spent the morning of Wednesday, 12 May 2010 in Downing Street, appointing ministers to our first cabinet, before sharing the stage in the sun-drenched Rose Garden. When Cameron turned to me shortly afterwards and told me that, \u201cWe may have overdone it a bit\u201d, he was probably right. It was easy to get a little carried away with the \u201cnew dawn\u201d feel of the occasion. But I soon found out that not only was I physically unprepared for government; government was physically unprepared for me.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It was easy to get a little carried away with the 'new dawn' feel of the occasion</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>On that first day in Downing Street, there was no office waiting for me. The in-house team at Number 10 quickly switched into gear for the incoming prime minister, but had little idea how to handle a deputy prime minister sharing power at the top. I was ushered upstairs to one of the first-floor state rooms. There I spent several hours, accompanied by Danny Alexander and a small number of my closest advisers, while the civil service buzzed around the building, supporting the new PM and largely ignoring us. There wasn\u2019t even a phone.<br></p> <p>While the 200 or so staff in Downing Street leapt into action to support the new prime minister, I was given just a single civil servant. My mistake, at least at first, was to accept the model presented to me. Having negotiated the coalition agreement without the help of civil servants, and with no experience in government myself, I simply didn\u2019t see the need to surround myself with teams of officials. And having witnessed the infantile Whitehall turf war waged by Gordon Brown\u2019s courtiers against Tony Blair, I thought it best to avoid rival power centres.</p> <p>The most unforgiving consequence was the tsunami of paperwork that fell directly to me to contend with. I was asked my opinion on things I didn\u2019t have the remotest clue about \u2013 dense, technical issues to do with the mechanics of everything from local government finance to energy subsidies. Every evening I would plonk myself on the sofa at home with my box and sit there dutifully wading through it, as family life happened around me. I would stay there virtually every night until the early hours. Then I would grab a few hours\u2019 sleep, which were disturbed most nights by our then one-year-old son Miguel, only to get up early to help get our two older boys fed, changed and packed off to school.</p> <p>The effect was not only physically draining, it was politically debilitating, too. Very quickly it became obvious that the central nervous system of Whitehall lay in the daily negotiations between me and Cameron. At the same time, the two most senior Liberal Democrats in the cabinet, Vince Cable and Chris Huhne, were, notwithstanding their obvious intellectual strengths, not known as nature\u2019s keenest team players. From the outset, their focus was devoted to their own departments \u2013 and their own political reputations. While they did this to great effect (and I encouraged them to do so), it meant I was unable to rely on others to defend in the media what we were doing. I soon became such a focal point for anger that I felt the impulse to defend myself publicly. No wonder Osborne said, somewhat smugly, in an interview in 2011 that, having expected to become British politics\u2019 public enemy number one, he \u201chadn\u2019t reckoned on Nick Clegg\u201d.</p> <p>I never contacted newspaper editors in response to negative coverage about myself. My only exception to this rule was when my family was affected. Every few weeks, Miriam and I had to devote a fair amount of time and emotional energy to rebutting ludicrous claims: that Miriam was somehow responsible for human-rights abuses in Western Sahara; that she was guilty of tax irregularities in her law firm several years before she was even employed by it; that our decision to send our Catholic children, who had attended a Catholic primary school, to a Catholic secondary school was a sign of hypocrisy. And so on.</p> <p>I mistakenly assumed that if I worked hard within government, did my homework and took decisions on their merits, then, one way or another, the truth \u2013 that the coalition was acting out of reasonable motives \u2013 would become plain to see and political dividends would follow. What I did not anticipate was what actually happened: I did all that \u2013 and no one knew about it. This enabled critics from the left to lampoon the Liberal Democrats as spineless, and critics from the right to lambast us as illegitimate irritants who shouldn\u2019t have been in government in the first place. The public readily turned away from us. I failed to realise an interesting paradox of modern politics: in an age of unprecedented transparency, the reality of power can still remain obscure to the public.</p> <p>By the spring of 2011, I was both drained and physically unfit. I smoked several cigarettes a night. I got virtually no exercise. Since becoming leader of the Liberal Democrats, I had dealt with pneumonia, chest pains, a broken toe, chronic coughs and bronchitis, while trying to look perky in public at all times. And throughout all of this, I would regularly crisscross London in the early evening to help put our three young boys to bed before returning to Westminster. No wonder there was a Nick Clegg Looking Sad website. They could have added Nick Clegg looking fat, pale and unhealthy, too.</p> <p>Over time, I worked out a better balance. I employed a larger team; I took up weekly kickboxing classes and had a rowing machine installed in a cubbyhole near my office; I cut down on the cigarettes and started to eat better. I handled the vast amount of paperwork more effectively by tackling most of it early in the morning instead of late at night, a switch of technique I later discovered Cameron had adopted, too.</p> <p>I discovered that one of the best ways to master the dysfunctional worlds of Westminster and Whitehall was simply to work outside them as much as possible. I restarted my pre-election habit of holding public question-and-answer sessions. I even started my own call-in show on LBC Radio with the veteran presenter Nick Ferrari. It was condemned as a foolish risk by many in the Westminster village, yet quickly proved to be sufficiently popular that a number of other politicians followed suit.</p> <p>Much of what I have described might seem like the footling ephemera of political life. But I believe it lifts the lid on something more serious: politics is already populated by a surfeit of political professionals and apparatchiks; if we want people with an independent turn of mind who have led normal lives to represent our country in the future, there will need to be a shift. If every youthful misdemeanour is recycled on social media for ever, if the dysfunctional operation of Whitehall continues to expect too much of people at the top, and if politicians cannot protect their loved ones, we should not be surprised if in future parliament is populated by robots, monks and nuns.</p> <p>\u2022 This is an edited extract from Politics: Between The Extremes, by Nick Clegg, published on 15 September by The Bodley Head at \u00a320.

  "<p>Going to the GP can be a stressful experience: the phone\u2019s engaged for ages, the receptionists are scary as hell and securing an appointment this side of Christmas can be tricky. Then you sit in the waiting room and read a sign that says you should only discuss one thing with the doctor and make another appointment if you have multiple problems. And you only have a 10-minute slot to tell your story, be examined, agree a plan and ask any supplementary questions.</p> <p>Many patients feel hurried by this short time frame, especially elderly people who may take several minutes just to walk into the room and settle down. And it\u2019s a tough ask for doctors too; in 10 minutes they have to engage with the current problem, deal with ongoing conditions like diabetes, offer interventions such as smoking cessation, feed the computer and listen out for a hidden agenda \u2013 the real reason you\u2019ve come. So it\u2019s no surprise that the British Medical Association is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/aug/28/doctor-appointments-15-minutes-bma-overweight-population\">calling for GP appointments to be extended to 15 minutes</a>.

But in the meantime, you\u2019ve bagged your precious appointment slot and you\u2019ve got 10 minutes to sort yourself out. How can you make the most of the time? Here\u2019s my advice.</p> <h2><strong>Rehearse what you want to say</strong><br><br></h2> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.gponline.com/gp-consultation-skills-10-minute-consultation/article/1357760\">GP will kick off</a> with an open question like: \u201cWhat brings you here today?\u201d This is an invitation to tell your story. Evidence suggests that if you are allowed to talk uninterrupted for 90 seconds, you\u2019ll be able to impart the key details. In most cases, the GP will make a diagnosis on the basis of what you say, backed up by examination and some basic tests if needed. Doctors are trained to listen out for \u201c<a href=\"http://www.gponline.com/education/medical-red-flags\">red flags</a>\u201d that suggest you may have a serious underlying problem.</p> <p>So if you say you\u2019ve had unexplained weight loss, blood in your poo or a new breast lump, expect further detailed questioning and urgent referral. Other diagnoses are made by recognising a pattern of typical symptoms that strongly suggest a particular cause. If you say you\u2019ve had an attack of severe pain in your right upper abdomen and right shoulder with nausea and vomiting that started after a large, fatty meal, your doctor will assume you\u2019ve got <a href=\"http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/cholecystitis/basics/symptoms/con-20034277\">gallstones</a>. That will mean blood tests, a scan and possibly referral for surgery. But if you say you\u2019ve had an attack of pain behind the breastbone and both shoulders with lots of burping, that suggests <a href=\"http://www.webmd.com/heartburn-gerd/guide/what-is-acid-reflux-disease\">acid reflux</a> which is treated with dietary advice and medication.</p> <h2><strong>Keep it clear and jargon-free</strong><br><br></h2> <p>In the bad old days of paternalistic medicine, people were labelled as being \u201cpoor historians\u201d. This was shorthand for doctors\u2019 frustration when they just couldn\u2019t get a clear story. These days the problem is often that the doctor is too rushed, doesn\u2019t listen carefully or fails to ask the right open-ended questions. But there is no doubt that some people are clearer than others. Doctors make the worst patients in my experience; they pre-empt the diagnosis \u2013 not always correctly \u2013 and use medical jargon instead of describing what\u2019s actually happening to them. People often Google their symptoms, find a diagnosis and then mould their story to fit. The \u201cbest historians\u201d write down their symptoms and just tell it as it is. It\u2019s fine to discuss what you\u2019re worried about at the end of the account. \u201cI\u2019ve had tingling in my right hand and pain in my neck for the past week since I got back from a cycling holiday. I\u2019ve never had it before and it\u2019s getting better now.\u201d That says \u201ctrapped nerve\u201d to the GP but if you\u2019re worried that you may have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/multiple-sclerosis\">multiple sclerosis</a>, you should say so.</p> <p>It can be good to take someone with you for support and as another pair of ears. They may have witnessed a seizure or have important information. But don\u2019t let them talk over you or interrupt. I am amazed at how many people in their 20s let their mums talk for them and how often spouses contradict their partner\u2019s account.</p> <h2><strong>Don\u2019t be coy</strong><br><br></h2> <p>By all means ask for a chaperone for intimate examinations; all GP surgeries offer the service. But don\u2019t waste precious time apologising for having an \u201cintimate\u201d problem. Similarly, don\u2019t worry about shaving; the doctor won\u2019t notice or care. Best to be honest, clear and use accurate language. You may feel embarrassed but the GP won\u2019t be. So if you have a smelly vaginal discharge and suspect you left a tampon in over a week ago, do say so. If you have no difficulty getting an erection but suffer from premature ejaculation, it\u2019s so much better to describe what happens than to mumble about \u201csomething wrong down there\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0917982014547ca8ef4c6256ae7c75b7c4e2ec5f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0917982014547ca8ef4c6256ae7c75b7c4e2ec5f/0_0_509_305/500.jpg\" alt=\"There\u2019s no place for embarrassment at the GP surgery.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Patients may feel embarrassed discussing intimate problems but the GP won\u2019t be.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: SolStock/Getty Images/iStockphoto</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Access all areas</strong><br><br></h2> <p>Be prepared to show the body part that you\u2019re concerned about. It sounds obvious, but people often pitch up to discuss their fungal toenails with every nail painted a dark and impenetrable colour. Or they have a rash on their calf but are wearing skinny jeans and knee high boots. It\u2019s understandable why teenage girls with facial acne like to wear thick foundation but this needs to be wiped off before the appointment if the acne\u2019s severity is to be assessed.</p> <h2><strong>Bring data \u2013 and urine</strong><br><br></h2> <p>Data is helpful; recording your weight, blood pressure, blood sugar levels, date of your last period, last seizure or migraine and details of possible allergies can all add valuable information if they relate to the problem you want to discuss. And if you think you may have a urine infection, it\u2019s great to produce a fresh sample with a flourish as you describe your symptoms of pain and frequent urination. The GP can check it on the spot, confirm your diagnosis, prescribe an antibiotic, check your blood pressure and still have time for a relaxed chat about your holiday. You\u2019ll be in and out within the 10 minutes; sometimes that\u2019s all it takes.</p>",
  "<p>On a street corner in Vedado, Havana\u2019s most affluent suburb, pedestrians have had to manoeuvre around a metre-wide hole in the pavement on <a href=\"http://www.lahabana.com/guide/calle-10/\">Calle 10</a> for months. Smashed concrete spills on to the road, encircling what has since turned into a pit of rubbish \u2013 a pockmark on the face of Havana\u2019s fading grandeur.</p> <p>This is, according to residents, \u201cthe way things are\u201d in the Cuban capital. As the city, its people and its architecture has aged, so too have its public services. While on the face of it, the city is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2016/apr/30/cuba-havana-music-art-restaurants-tech-tattoos\">getting a new lift</a> through the easing of Cuban-US relations, municipal support structures are failing badly in many parts of the city. As residents get tired of these inefficiencies, they\u2019re expressing their anger \u2013 and pointing to the breakdown of Cuban socialism.</p> <p>\u201cWhen <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/21/obamas-touch-down-in-havana-but-cuban-concern-is-whether-business-takes-off\">Obama came [in March]</a> they cleaned the whole street; they put the beggars and homeless in a special asylum,\u201d says Hamlet Lavastida, a 33-year-old artist who lives in Havana. \u201cThey made new roads, they painted many buildings, just in the areas where Obama was going to be. People joked that now we\u2019re going to have to wait another 50 years for the next US president to come, to make another new road ...\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/jun/17/havana-city-brink-change\">Havana: one of the world's great cities on the brink of a fraught transition</a> </p> </aside>  <p>These may just be lighthearted jokes for now, but Lavastida suggests there is a growing discontent among Cubans about the state of public services: the dirty streets, the broken infrastructure.</p> <p>\u201cSometimes the telephone company \u2013 of course, controlled by the state \u2013 dig a hole to put in the wires and cables of the telephone, but they never cover the hole. They leave it like that for months,\u201d he says. </p> <p>Water leaks flow regularly across the streets of Havana\u2019s barrios without being fixed. Waste can overflow public bins for weeks, with residents having no idea when it will be collected. When referring to the lack of cohesion between the various government-run, centralised organisations \u2013 the communications company, the water company, the rubbish collectors (<em>\u201c</em><em>communales\u201d</em>) \u2013 Lavastida uses the word \u201canarchy\u201d.</p> <p>Walking through the city centre with three writers from <a href=\"http://www.havanatimes.org/\">Havana Times</a> \u2013 an English-language blog that describes itself as \u201copen-minded writing from Cuba\u201d \u2013 the conversation quickly turns to Havana\u2019s streets. \u201cWe have serious environmental problems in the city.

Instead of overpowering petrol fumes from Havana\u2019s ageing cars, you smell sewage and dust compounding in the muggy air. We turn a corner and rubbish falls from a flowing dustbin. Stagnant water from a leaking drain sits along a pavement. Above it, a building with cracks in the wall is held up by wooden scaffolding. </p> <p>\u201cThe trash is all over the place,\u201d says Luis Miguel Bahia, who lives in <a href=\"http://www.lahabana.com/guide/havana-guide-home/places-in-havana/other-places/places-in-cerro/\">Cerro</a>, one of Havana\u2019s poorest municipalities. \u201cI walk and when I turn the next corner hoping for some fresh air, there is the smell of this trash that\u2019s all over the road, and I think: \u2018Where am I? Why did this place become like this?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Unsurprisingly, the outer neighbourhoods and poorer communities are more neglected. Will Aurelievich also lives in Cerro; he tells me that around his home their sewage system broke, and residents were having to avoid walking on \u201cactual human shit\u201d, as he describes it, for six months before it was fixed. He was planning on making a documentary about the problem, but coincidentally as soon as he started the project the state services came to fix it.<br></p> <p>Residents of Alamar, another neglected district, have often written in Havana Times about the <a href=\"http://www.havanatimes.org/?p=120733\">inefficiencies in rubbish collection in their neighbourhood</a> \u2013 one of the posts is entitled \u201cCuba: till the shit do us part\u201d. The <em>communales</em> (rubbish collection) apparently <a href=\"http://www.havanatimes.org/?p=117258\">receives the biggest state budget</a> but is said to be \u201cone of the most inefficient sectors in the country\u201d.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"be1add13597aa75c514b70203a849789b67b42ed\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/be1add13597aa75c514b70203a849789b67b42ed/0_23_1087_652/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Havana\u2019s crumbling public services\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Havana today: \u2018The authorities here have very limited budget. Infrastructurally, they\u2019re really struggling.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Naomi Larsson</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>One of the problems, it seems, is the high level of bureaucracy here. The city administration is theoretically answerable to the national assembly of people\u2019s power, but they don\u2019t have budgetary control \u2013 that is in the hands of central government. A channel of complaint from the population can only lead to an advisory department, rather than the funding source, according to Stephen Wilkinson at the International Institute for the Study of Cuba.</p> <p>But above all, Cuba has limited resources. It\u2019s a trade-dependent country living with a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/22/obama-cuba-embargo-free-market-economy\">56-year US embargo</a>. <a href=\"http://www.lse.ac.uk/economicHistory/whosWho/academic_staff/Profiles/HYaffe.aspx\">Helen Yaffe</a>, an LSE fellow who specialises in the Cuban economy and has spent years living in Havana, says: \u201cYou have to start with the blockade [which has prevented trade and investment from the US since 1960], although you don\u2019t want to always sound defensive. But the authorities here have very limited budget. They have to prioritise what they do with their hard currency.\u201d<br></p> <p>As Yaffe points out, Cuba is a country of contradictions. You might have to swerve a hole in the pavement on a daily basis, but the government does provide free universal healthcare and education (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2016/mar/21/barack-obama-cuba-visit-raul-castro?page=with:block-56f04384e4b04098f62c5d71#block-56f04384e4b04098f62c5d71\">Raul Castro used these services as a defence</a> when questioned about the government\u2019s record of human rights violations during Obama\u2019s visit). Indeed, Yaffe recalls a time when her two-year-old daughter was struck with pneumonia when they were staying in Havana. \u201cInside a hospital, the level of care was phenomenal. Yet we were in a room without hot running in water; in fact, there wasn\u2019t even water all the time.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/feb/01/cuba-for-sale-havana-is-now-the-big-cake-and-everyone-is-trying-to-get-a-slice\">Cuba for sale: \u2018Havana is now the big cake \u2013 and everyone is trying to get a slice\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThis shows the contradictions that Cuba\u2019s had to face in terms of its development. Infrastructurally, they\u2019re really struggling.\u201d<br></p> <p>Lavastida, who recently moved back to his home country after living abroad for five years, acknowledges the lack of resources, but he suggests the disintegration of the city\u2019s infrastructure and public services goes much deeper. He believes people care less about their local community, reflecting the breakdown in Cuban socialist values.<br></p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a lack of public interest in what is happening in the street. This is somehow also part of the change; that Cubans are becoming individualistic,\u201d he says. He sees this apathy as a \u201cpassive dissidence\u201d.<br></p> <p>\u201cI remember when I was a kid there was something called <em>Domingo Rojo</em> (\u2018Red Sunday\u2019) and everybody in the neighbourhood decided we were going to clean the streets, like a communal voluntary service, and it was great. But nobody believes in the voluntary thing now, in communism. There is incredible hostility between government and citizens \u2026 every day.\u201d<br></p> <p>Bahia agrees. He has also noticed a feeling of apathy in Cuban society: \u201cIn the long term people react to the the impositions [by the government] of solidarity, the community and so on. Those kinds of things must not be imposed because it creates the opposite effect. For example, with the trash on the street, I told a neighbour about it, and he said to me to take another route to avoid this trash. No one cares.\u201d<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"226021fc68641892848f0e00210a3f2b67415f9c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/226021fc68641892848f0e00210a3f2b67415f9c/0_63_1087_652/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The communales (rubbish collection) is said to be \u2018one of the most inefficient sectors in the country\u2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The <em>communales</em> (rubbish collection) is said to be \u2018one of the most inefficient sectors in the country\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Naomi Larsson</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As more foreign money enters Havana, it seems individualism and the gap between rich and poor will only increase. The number of Cubans <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/09/18/world/americas/cuba-state.html\">working in the private sector has reached nearly half a million</a> \u2013 three times the number in 2008, and there is a new generation of <em>nuevos ricos</em> (new rich) who isolate those left on government wages. Habaneros worry that privatisation is slipping into the public sector: apparently if you hand the <em>communales</em> some money, they\u2019ll take your rubbish straight away.<br></p> <p>In the last Community Party Congress in April, Raul Castro released <a href=\"http://palgrave.typepad.com/yaffe/2016/06/cuban-communists-in-congress-change-within-a-socialist-framework-by-helen-yaffe.html\">new documents outlining the meaning of Cuban socialism</a>. Yaffe says this was hugely significant, and \u201cthe need for improvement is very much a focus of the plan document\u201d; but only time will tell if it will change the way Cubans feel about their communities.<br></p> <p>Walking back through Vedado, I see a machine grabbing some of the rubbish in Calle 10, engulfed in a cloud of dust.

  "<p>Few people have shaved their head, hung from under a fast-moving truck and been catapulted through the air all in the name of work. But then not many people are as tough and determined as stuntwoman Dayna Grant. She has worked as a double for A-list actors including Charlize Theron and Tilda Swinton during her thrilling 20-year career, but to the easy-going Kiwi, it\u2019s all in a day\u2019s work.</p> <p>Like the actors they\u2019re doubling for, stunt artists also have to get into character during a shoot. For the action film Mad Max: Fury Road, Grant spent nine months in the Namibian desert as Oscar-winning Theron\u2019s double. \u201cI lived and breathed that film,\u201d she says. \u201cWe became the characters. I had to shave my head. Everyday we were pumped into our characters. The whole film was a stunt from start to end \u2013 I was flying, running, sliding under a moving truck, hanging out the side of a truck door.\u201d</p> <p>Stunting isn\u2019t just about jumping out of buildings and fighting scenes, though. \u201cOur job is to train the actor,\u201d says Grant. \u201cIn some jobs we train with the actor every day. We could be in the gym with them to make sure they have the right body type for the film. We\u2019re with them the whole time, and any time they have downtime we are training ourselves to make sure we\u2019re fit for the scenes. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"e939063cd70b2a70ecd79e0ef50c2e92554a391e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e939063cd70b2a70ecd79e0ef50c2e92554a391e/42_0_1250_750/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Grant\u2019s stunts sometimes involve leaping off a building while on fire (with a fireproof suit, of course).\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Grant\u2019s stunts can involve leaping off a building while on fire (with a fireproof suit, of course).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dayna Grant</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIn [fantasy adventure film] Hercules, I was driving chariots and doing archery, so we have to practise whatever skill is in the film. You get there three months before filming starts and have full on training for 12-hours a day. You\u2019re rehearsing all the time.\u201d</p> <p>Grant fell into the world of stunting when she was 18 when some male stunt friends asked her to audition to be a stuntwoman in cult hit TV show Xena: Warrior Princess, which was shot in her native New Zealand. Although a keen gymnast and horse rider, Grant admits she knew nothing about the profession and didn\u2019t expect to get the job. But they liked her and she started the next day. \u201cI was thrown into it and it was pretty full on,\u201d she says. \u201cI was fighting, stunt riding and catapulting through the air.\u201d </p> <p>From there she continued working in TV shows before landing bigger roles including doubling for Tilda Swinton in The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. \u201cThere were never any auditions,\u201d reveals Grant. \u201cAs soon as you are known, you\u2019re just contacted.\u201d</p> <p>Amanda Foster joined the industry when she was slightly older, in her late 20s, while working as a PE teacher and a film extra after hearing that there were no British black stuntwomen. She landed her first major role in 1997 when she doubled for Whoopi Goldberg in A Knight in Camelot. </p> <p>\u201cI was sword-fighting, jumping over tables, getting thrown about,\u201d Foster recalls. \u201cIt was good fun.\u201d She also doubled for Halle Berry in the Bond film Die Another Day. \u201cIt was practically all action \u2013 I was abseiling down wires and involved in dagger fights. Berry was very sweet and often stopped by to watch the stunts.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I was sword-fighting, jumping over tables, getting thrown about</p> <footer> <cite>Amanda Foster</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Foster says the best bit about being a stunt performer is the variety involved in the job. \u201cI love that I\u2019m consistently challenged and learn new things.\u201d </p> <p>But how worried is she about accidents when faced with challenging and sometimes dangerous stunts? \u201cWe don\u2019t talk about that stuff,\u201d she replies. \u201cIt\u2019s a good day when you get in your car at the end and don\u2019t leave in an ambulance. Accidents can happen everywhere. Here you\u2019re reliant on other people doing their job.

They pay for my accommodation and I just bring the kids.\u201d </p> <p>She admits it can be intense, however. \u201cI can be away for six to nine months per film and it\u2019s pretty much six or seven days a week and 18\u201319 hours a day. It\u2019s full on. I\u2019ll spend my day off with the kids.\u201d </p> <p>Both women are well aware they\u2019ve chosen very unusual careers. Grant recalls when her son came back from school one day: \u201c\u2018I\u2019ve just realised you\u2019re not a normal mum. Most mums drink tea and sit on the couch. You jump off buildings and set yourself on fire\u2019. He had thought that was normal, actually.\u201d Now her son, who is 15, is a stunt performer as well.</p> <p>Does being a stunt performer have a certain lifespan? \u201cI\u2019ll keep going until my body won\u2019t allow me to,\u201d says Foster.</p> <p><strong>Looking for a job?

  "<p>The British government, like its European and US counterparts, has been struggling to find an effective strategy to counter \u201cradicalisation\u201d within Muslim communities. When programmes like <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/apr/21/government-prevent-strategy-promoting-extremism-maina-kiai\" title=\"\">Prevent</a> were established, they quickly came under heavy criticism, both for their approach and for their poor results. Over a decade&#xa0;on, it is clear not a single anti-radicalisation scheme, either in Europe or the US,&#xa0;has proved effective.</p> <p>There are several reasons for this.&#xa0;To&#xa0;begin with there is the terminology employed. Religious radicalisation is described as a process through which individuals pursue a continuing trajectory, leading from a \u201cmoderate\u201d understanding and practice of religion, to an increasingly violent or extremist involvement. Nothing could be further from reality.</p> <p>The religious practice of the overwhelming majority of those caught up by Isis propaganda is weak at best, and mostly partial or very recent. This diagnosis has been reconfirmed time and time again since 11 September 2001. Far from being \u201cradicalised\u201d, such vulnerable individuals slide into terrorist action not because they are supportive of Isis and its claim to \u201cIslam\u201d, but for mostly non-religious reasons. To respond to a complex phenomenon only by pointing to signs of increased religiosity in a given individual, or by targeting a community or a specific religious profile, is unlikely to work.</p> <p>Undoubtedly religious interpretation plays a role: extremist and literalist readings of Islam\u2019s source texts exist, and can only be countered by solid arguments produced by Muslim scholars whose credibility is widely recognised. Individual profiles are also a crucial factor, as are social status, unemployment, drug use and psychological imbalance.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Acts of violence do not take place in a political vacuum</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Young people may be drawn to a cause that purports to lend new meaning to their lives, allows them to overcome their daily frustrations, and even gives them feelings of pride. But in&#xa0;such instances they must be seen more as propaganda victims than as consciously responsible for their actions, however extreme.</p> <p>At the <a href=\"http://www.euro-muslims.eu/\" title=\"\">European Muslim Network</a>, a&#xa0;thinktank I chair in Brussels, we have&#xa0;heard many testimonies of young boys and girls being manipulated via the&#xa0;internet or through dubious social contacts, who are completely disconnected from Muslim communities. Such individuals should be dealt with according to their background; if we focus solely on security concerns related to religious expression, any action will fall short of its target.</p> <p>Politics must also be singled out as a prime cause of citizens slipping into violence \u2013 an issue on which deradicalisation programmes are almost entirely mute. Acts of violence do not take place in a political vacuum. As early as 2005, the then prime minister Tony Blair refused to admit any connection between British foreign policy and radicalisation. Though nothing can justify the killing of innocent civilians in London or Paris, any more than in Damascus or Baghdad, it\u2019s clear that western policies in the Middle East have led to high levels of frustration and may well explain why some individuals have adopted extremist views.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"789984b5a36ebb41015b0a95fe36d75a99f8b8e8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/789984b5a36ebb41015b0a95fe36d75a99f8b8e8/0_0_3500_2399/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Children arriving at school.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"685\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018To act against violent extremism does not mean snooping on every single \u2018sign of radicalisation\u2019, or criminalising every individual.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Milligan/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Silence on the Palestinian tragedy, western intervention in Iraq and ambiguity in Syria, not to mention <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/09/yemen-saudia-arabia-us-military-trump-clinton\" title=\"\">support for the Saudi war against Yemen</a>, has provided ample material for young people to question incoherent western policies. So to deny the role of politics is not only inconsistent; it is above all counterproductive.</p> <p>This is made even worse when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/mar/09/prevent-strategy-stifles-debate-and-makes-teachers-feel-vulnerable\" title=\"\">political expression is itself seen as a potential indicator of radicalisation</a>. The struggle against violent extremism must simultaneously protect freedom of speech, particularly when practised by Muslims. The possibility that anyone can express their dissatisfaction, frustration and disagreement <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/sep/23/prevent-counter-terrorism-strategy-schools-demonising-muslim-children\" title=\"\">without becoming immediately suspected or stigmatised is</a>, in itself, a powerful protective measure against those who call for violence. Those Muslims who are critical of government policies while rejecting violence are perhaps best placed to influence young people attracted to extremist acts.</p> <p>Numerous testimonies across Europe and the US confirm that these measures are not targeting the terrorists but targeting all Muslims. Over the past five years I have met increasing numbers of Muslim women \u2013 both in Europe and the US \u2013 who fear being visibly religious and have begun to refrain from wearing their&#xa0;headscarves in public. Some individuals have been jailed in the UK, Germany and in Belgium, or have been detained under house arrest in France, because of so-called suspicious activities \u2013 such as visiting a website, or for expressing their&#xa0;views on Syria or Palestine which are deemed \u201cdangerous\u201d. We will not get peaceful societies if we fear intellectual arguments.</p> <p>The struggle against violent extremism requires a comprehensive approach that brings together all shades&#xa0;of opinion. However, the vast majority of government programmes are narrowly focused on security, favour&#xa0;short-term measures, and are inclined to see Muslim communities as seedbeds of potential violence to be kept under constant surveillance. In fact, security and surveillance have become the two dominant aspects of deradicalisation strategies.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/sep/23/prevent-counter-terrorism-strategy-schools-demonising-muslim-children\">'You worry they could take your kids': is the Prevent strategy in schools demonising Muslim children?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>What is needed instead is a plan that deals with the phenomenon at many different levels and, first and foremost, focuses on grassroots education. To do this, local Muslim organisations must accept full partnership. Communication needs to be established with such groups to help build confidence in state institutions. At present, those organisations \u2013 the \u201cgood Muslims\u201d\u2013 which the government collaborates with or finances, frequently enjoy no street credibility: how could they, if they never criticise the domestic or foreign policies of their government sponsor?</p> <p>We must add to this the task of mapping the diversity of social, political and religious trends, and the unanimous rejection of extremist violence. The frustration of individuals must be taken seriously: problems should be identified, and greater social justice and social cohesion established, even though the results may not appear immediately.</p> <p>An in-depth review of current political rhetoric is imperative. Our politicians are ethicising and Islamising the question of violent extremism in order to avoid&#xa0;dealing with real issues. The politics of fear must be abandoned. To act against violent extremism does not mean snooping on every single \u201csign of radicalisation\u201d, or criminalising every individual, or group of individuals&#xa0;involved.</p> <p>The UK government has created an atmosphere of suspicion and stigmatisation of Muslims. An effect of this will ultimately be to nurture the very radicalisation they wish to eradicate. A re-examination of strategy is required, going beyond security and surveillance, and placing greater emphasis on education, partnership, and the social and political factors at play. Unfortunately we are very far from this goal.</p>",
  "<p>Relatives of victims of the IRA\u2019s 1974 Birmingham pub bombings are to meet the home secretary, Amber Rudd to request funding for legal representation at the resumed inquest.</p> <p>The private discussions on Monday come amid mounting concern over the way police, prison officers and local authority staff are invariably provided with lawyers at coroners\u2019 courts whereas the families of those who died are repeatedly denied legal aid.<br></p> <p>In June, Louise Hunt, the senior coroner for Birmingham and Solihull, ruled that the inquest into the double pub bombing that killed 21 people and injured 222 others should be completed because there is a \u201cwealth of evidence that still has not been heard\u201d about the atrocities.<br></p> <p>The original inquest was adjourned in 1975 after six men were convicted of carrying out the attack.

His columns weren\u2019t declared illegal, they weren\u2019t withdrawn and Bolt wasn\u2019t even made to apologise.</p> <p>A few sentences were appended clarifying factually incorrect claims. That was it.</p> <p>Gallileo, he ain\u2019t.</p> <p>Everyone knows that, had a judge decreed that Bolt couldn\u2019t write or say particular words, white conservative tears would have flowed into a deluge of Biblical proportions, a great ocean of salty outrage and self-pity.</p> <p>But that hypocrisy\u2019s typical of the so-called free speech debate in Australia, where there\u2019s almost an inverse proportion between the severity of censorship and the degree of outrage of the so-called libertarians.</p> <p>You could not find, for instance, a more draconian violation of speech rights than that underpinning the offshore detention of asylum seekers. The immigration department flatly refuses to release basic information about its activities; journalists lack access to camps in which staff face two years jail for speaking out about what they see; refugees remain detained for years without charge in isolated facilities with little contact with the outside world.</p> <p>Yet, almost without exception, the senators campaigning for freedom enthusiastically support a refugee policy that couldn\u2019t exist without censorship.</p> <p>There\u2019s an especial irony to the indifference shown by the free speech warriors to the CUB case, since the ban imposed on the word \u201cscab\u201d actually illustrates a genuine problem with the sorts of legislation that our freedom senators hate. </p> <p>The legal system (almost by definition) simultaneously abstracts and individualises behaviour it seeks to criminalise, stripping it from the context from which it derives meaning. As a result, there\u2019s a long history of measures passed by those seeking to deter racism or sexism and then being hijacked by the privileged to use against the oppressed (much as David Leyonhjelm\u2019s seeking to do with his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/15/david-leyonhjelm-racial-discrimination-complaint-angry-white-male-fairfax-18c\">stunt prosecution of Fairfax</a>).</p> <p>We can see something similar taking place in Abbottsford, where the commission\u2019s ruling derives from amendments introduced into the Fair Work Act by the Gillard government in 2013 to combat workplace bullying.</p> <p>As workplace relations minister <a href=\"http://www.news.com.au/national/workplace-bullies-face-10000-fine-in-gillard-plan/story-fncynjr2-1226658053191\">Bill Shorten championed the changes</a>, saying they\u2019d help combat toxic work environments.</p> <p>Instead, <a href=\"http://www.afr.com/news/economy/employment/labors-bullying-laws-turned-on-union-pickets-20160823-gqzcav\">as the Australian Financial Review notes</a>, the laws have given bosses an important new weapon against trade unions. The article<em> </em>cites employment lawyer Stephen Jauncey, who thinks employers could now use the amendments to combat \u201ccommunity protests\u201d \u2013 even if strikers aren\u2019t involved and the protests don\u2019t involve obstructions, assault or trespass. Industrial relations barrister Stuart Wood, QC, seems equally bullish.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a need for quick, effective and cheap remedies [to end pickets] and this is a good example of someone being creative and innovative in achieving that,\u201d he says.</p> <p>How did measures intended to protect workers become a weapon against them?</p> <p>Again, the problem\u2019s one of context.</p> <p>The Fair Work Commission describes \u201cbelittling or humiliating comments\u201d as an example of bullying.</p> <p>Is it belittling to call someone a scab? <a href=\"http://www.iamll1005.org/definition_of_a_scab.htm\">The novelist Jack London certainly thought so</a>. He wrote:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>After God had finished the rattlesnake, the toad, the vampire, He had some awful substance left with which He made a scab. A scab is a two-legged animal with a cork-screw soul, a water-logged brain, a combination backbone of jelly and glue. Where others have hearts, he carries a tumor of rotten principles. When a scab comes down the street, men turn their backs and angels weep in heaven, and the Devil shuts the gates of Hell to keep him out. No man has a right to scab so long as there is a pool of water to drown his carcass in, or a rope long enough to hang his body with.</p> </blockquote> <p>Not exactly a compliment, then. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/past/issues/04jan/london.htm\">But in another passage</a>, London explained why scabs had earned such opprobrium. </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>To strike at a man\u2019s food and shelter is to strike at his life, and in a society organized on a tooth-and-nail basis, such an act \u2026 [is] menacing and terrible. It is for this reason that a laborer is so fiercely hostile to another laborer who offers to work for less pay or longer hours \u2026 To sell his day\u2019s work for two dollars instead of two dollars and a half means that he, his wife, and his children will not have so good a roof over their heads, such warm clothes on their backs, such substantial food in their stomachs.</p> </blockquote> <p>That\u2019s a pretty good summation of what\u2019s taking place in Abbottsford, where 55 workers have been sacked \u2013 and then invited to apply for their old jobs on terms that, in some cases, amount to pay cut of 65%.</p> <p>In the face of union protests, a contract company called Programmed has engaged temporary employees to keep the brewery operating. Those individuals are behaving precisely as London describes: they\u2019re driving down others\u2019 wages and conditions for their own benefit.</p> <p>No doubt it\u2019s unpleasant (even humiliating) for the contractors to hear themselves described as \u201cscabs\u201d (or \u201cdogs\u201d, \u201cfuckwits\u201d, etc). But the truth doesn\u2019t change according to how someone feels about it.</p> <p>The Fair Work Act defines \u201cbullying\u201d as behaviour that\u2019s \u201cunreasonable\u201d. Is it unreasonable to dissuade strikebreakers from destroying hard-won awards? Certainly, CUB management thinks so but one suspects that most of us, if we were confronting the prospect of either unemployment or a massive pay cut, would form a different opinion.</p> <p>But the legislation doesn\u2019t make such distinctions, enabling a contractor seeking to pulverise working conditions to get an order restraining the union in the name of \u201chealth and safety\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jun/30/dont-let-the-election-distract-you-from-whats-happening-to-workers\">Don't let the election distract you from what's happening to workers | Van Badham</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There\u2019s one other point worth noting about the CUB case. In comments to the Financial Review, ETU state secretary Troy Gray explains that \u201cthis dispute is not going to turn on whether you can call a \u2018scab\u2019 a \u2018scab\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>In the real world, censorship cases are almost never solely to do with censorship. It\u2019s far more common that the people being silenced are menaced in a variety of other ways as well.</p> <p>The detainees in Nauru and Manus Island, for instance, want to have their voices heard. But much more than that, they want to be resettled.</p> <p>In the same way, the unionists at Abbottsford are being censored. But, as Troy Gray says, that\u2019s only a minor part of what\u2019s at stake. </p> <p>Again, the comparison with Bernardi and his ilk could not be greater. Could you imagine the yelps of anguish and outrage were the wages of all parliament\u2019s senators were suddenly cut by, oh I don\u2019t know, 65%?</p> <p>But, of course, that\u2019s not on the agenda. For the campaign against section 18C is being pushed by the most privileged people in the nation, a crew who invoke high principles only to obscure how little skin they have in the game.</p>",
  "<p><strong>\u2018Where are we going to go, Dad?\u2019</strong><br></p> <p>Well, it only took three episodes for Travis to learn what viewers knew since the pilot: his son Chris is the absolute worst. And it\u2019s not even his reprehensible shooting of the farmer at the end of the episode that confirmed it. He sort of behaved like a jackass the whole time. First he goes into the taco stand, steals someone\u2019s food and water, and takes off leaving them to clean up a herd of zombies. Then he lies to his father about how he came across the supplies. Then, when the guys finally confront them at their campsite, he behaves like an entitled jerk thinking that he deserved their food because he killed one of the zombies. God, why can\u2019t something just eat Chris?</p> <p>For a while, Travis thought he could get through to Chris after the traumatic death of his mother in the season one finale. They had a nice moment where he taught him to drive on the empty highway and Chris even avoided gunning it and running over the sole walker ambling down the shoulder, which would have been the immature thing to do. When they were having their little father-son campfire chat, Travis wanted to find a house where the two of them could settle down and start a life together, just the two of them. Chris, however, seemed to not want any part of that even from the outset.</p> <p><strong>\u2018We were nothing before this. We were less than. But the end times made us gods.\u2019</strong></p> <p>The problem, of course, is the Sigma Alpha Epsilon brothers they meet on the road. We don\u2019t know for a fact that they are frat boys, but these are the most bro-y bros to ever play lacrosse. One of them even delivered the above quote when they were traveling in the pickup truck, which is entirely awful. Then one of them explained that they call the zombies the \u201cwasted\u201d because they look drunk, like it\u2019s an eternal spring break. Then they talked about how much they love rape culture and wish that they could still log on to a men\u2019s rights forum on Reddit. Well, that didn\u2019t happen, but it seemed like it could.</p> <p>Brandon, Derrick and Baby James were awful from the minute they rolled up to Travis and Chris at the campsite and, even though they seemed up to no good, Chris definitely wanted to trust them. Something about their eagerness to take on these two strangers seemed false to me, like there was some kind of game they were playing. Chris, desperate for the validation of men and dying to hang out with some people his own age, falls right into their clique. </p> <p>When they find a farm that seems like a good place for Travis and Chris to settle down, Chris would rather chase chickens in the barn with his new friends. Isn\u2019t this what every teenager goes through when he has to pull away from his parents? The difference here is that the world has ended. Chris is right, that the two of them need a group to stay alive, but Travis is also right that attaching themselves to the junior varsity wrestling team probably isn\u2019t a smart idea. </p> <p>Regardless of the negative influence of the bros, it is Chris who kills the farmer when he tries to kick them out of the barn. They might be having some sway over him, but there is something that is broken inside of Chris, something that came loose after the death of his mother, that Travis not only hates but also can\u2019t seem to fix. God, Chris is the absolute worst. </p> <p><strong>\u2018I contained the situation\u2019 </strong></p> <p>Elena, the insane hotel event planner, might also be the worst. At the top of the show we learn that, when a zombie shows up at the wedding being held in the hotel when the plague hit, she locked all the guests in the room with it. Her justification was that she needed to contain the situation. Elena is clinging to an old role, the person in charge of the hotel, when she needs to abandon that and find what she has to do now that one\u2019s profession and loyalty to an employer has been rendered obsolete. </p> <p>With her cousin Hector, Elena is trying to maintain some semblance of order and is failing miserably. She\u2019s also at war with the remaining guests, who want her punished for what she did at the wedding, even though it seems like Elena is punishing herself plenty. She might seem like an awful person to them, but she helps Alicia get down to the ground floor to find her family. She might have made a grave mistake, but she\u2019s not as awful as they all think. </p> <p><strong>\u2018They\u2019re good people. They\u2019re strong people\u2019 </strong></p> <p>Alicia is also proving herself to be stronger than she was initially. She finds a way to fight off the walkers and has somehow acquired some sick butterfly knife skills. (Did she watch a YouTube video or something?) Her move opening up the elevator and jumping onto the cable to avoid some zombies was a good one, but I\u2019m not so sure she should have been so quick to trust Elena. This woman is clearly nuts and running around a hotel brandishing an ax. Should Alicia really be taking her side and sending the herd of zombies after the living guests? They seem a lot more sane and rational. Maybe she should team up with them. </p> <p>Anyway, Alicia and her two new friends disappear into the bowels of the hotel and end up in a bathroom, where her mother, suddenly sober after sharing a whole bottle of tequila with Strand, has been hiding out waiting for the flesh biters to dissipate. They might be waiting there for as long as it takes Chris to become a tolerable person, and by that I mean forever. </p>",
  "<p>Voters across New South Wales will cast their ballots in council elections on Saturday \u2013 or at least those <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/may/12/nsw-council-mergers-19-new-local-bodies-created-under-forced-plan\">not living in recently amalgamated council areas</a> will.</p> <p>The contest in the City of Sydney promises to be interesting. The independent lord mayor, Clover Moore, is running for a fourth term after easily winning the past three elections but she faces new rules which will make her task significantly harder, thanks to a lot of additional business votes being cast.<br></p> <p>Moore has been a presence in the inner city of Sydney for well over 30 years, first elected to South Sydney council in 1980. Moore served on the City of Sydney throughout the 1980s and managed to win a state seat as an independent in 1988 after the council was sacked.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/may/22/new-south-wales-council-mergers-have-political-ramifications\">New South Wales council mergers have political ramifications | Ben Raue</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There is a long history of state governments of all political persuasions rewriting the council boundaries and the voting rules to determine who wins control of Town Hall. A Labor government in the 1940s amalgamated a number of small neighbouring councils into a larger City of Sydney which included a string of Labor-voting working class suburbs in areas like Alexandria, Redfern, Glebe and Newtown.</p> <p>A Liberal government in the 1960s broke off those suburbs into a separate South Sydney council, allowing conservative business interests in the Sydney city centre to control the council. Another Labor government brought these suburbs together in the early 1980s, and then the Greiner Liberal government in 1989 broke Sydney and South Sydney apart.</p> <p>The Carr Labor government thought it was on to a winner in 2004 when it merged the traditionally Labor-voting suburbs of South Sydney council with a much smaller CBD-based City of Sydney council, but their plans were undone when Moore announced she would return to local politics and run for lord mayor.</p> <p>Moore easily won election in 2004, and went on to win second and third terms in 2008 and 2012. Not only did she win the lord mayoralty but candidates on her ticket won enough seats on the council to give her an absolute majority on the local council.</p> <p>After 12 years as mayor, Moore remains very popular with residents of the city, but has drawn the enmity of the state government and some local business interests.</p> <p>The city has acted as a rival source of influence to the state government, loudly advocating for improved public transport, improving cycleways and other local infrastructure, and regularly disagreeing with the Liberal state government. </p> <p>The City of Sydney is not the most populous council in New South Wales, but is much more financially powerful than its neighbours thanks to rates revenue from the central business district. The council has been effective at using these financial resources to improve services and infrastructure for local residents, and has been a constant thorn in the side of Labor and Liberal state governments over the past 12 years.</p> <p>Recent state legislation was aimed at shifting the balance away from residents and towards businesses. In most councils ratepaying businesses have a right to vote, but the vote is voluntary and most businesses don\u2019t bother to enrol or vote.</p> <p>The 2014 law which only applies to the City of Sydney, makes it compulsory for local businesses to enrol and vote and gives each business two votes.</p> <p>Only 1,709 businesses enrolled to vote in the City of Sydney at the 2012 election. This year that number is just shy of 23,000, suggesting as many as 45,000 new business votes could be cast. This voting bloc will make a significant difference in a council where only 120,000 people voted in 2012.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/30/does-the-nsw-government-care-more-about-litter-than-the-safety-of-cyclists\">Does the NSW government care more about litter than the safety of cyclists? | Steven Herrick</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Liberal councillor Christine Forster, sister of Tony Abbott, will be hoping to capitalise on this business vote <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/jul/11/tony-abbotts-sister-says-he-will-not-have-big-role-in-sydney-mayor-bid\">as she aims to replace Moore as lord mayor</a>. It would be a mistake, however, to assume that all of these newly enfranchised voters would be voting against the sitting lord mayor \u2013 Moore will likely still pick up quite a few votes from friendly businesses.</p> <p> While Moore is still the favourite to win the mayoralty, her team may struggle to win enough council seats to control the council. If the Clover Moore Team can only win a handful of seats, she may need to rely on Labor and Greens councillors on controversial issues.</p> <p>If Moore was replaced by her Liberal rival Forster, it would likely see a shift in the focus of the council away from the residential \u201cvillages\u201d Moore has championed and towards business, and would result in a council less willing to set out a different direction from the state Liberal government.</p>",
  "<p>Christopher Pyne has accused the Labor senator Sam Dastyari of breaking an \u201cethical rule\u201d by receiving gifts from Chinese business interests but ruled out a government crackdown on foreign donations.</p> <p>Pyne, the leader of the House, called for Dastyari to be sacked.
