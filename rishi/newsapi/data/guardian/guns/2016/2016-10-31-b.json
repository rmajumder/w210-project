  "<p>A new academic study has found \u201ca pattern of discrimination\u201d against passengers with African American-sounding names by Uber and Lyft drivers.</p> <p>The findings call into question a <a href=\"https://medium.com/matter/ubering-while-black-146db581b9db#.yle9nmpsl\">central narrative</a> of ride-hail apps that they solve the entrenched and humiliating problem of hailing a cab for black passengers. </p> <p>Waiting times for black passengers in Seattle were 35% longer than for white passengers, and drivers in Boston cancelled rides for black passengers more than twice as frequently as for white passengers, researchers found in a <a href=\"http://www.nber.org/papers/w22776?utm_campaign=ntw&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=ntw\">study</a> published Monday by the National Bureau of Economic Research. </p> <p>In order to study the issue, researchers designed randomized trials by sending research assistants on nearly 1,500 rides in Seattle and Boston. </p> <p>\u201cIs a taxi driver\u2019s decision, made in public view, not to stop for an African American passenger being eliminated? Or is it just being replaced by a TNC driver\u2019s screen swipe, made in private, that has the same effect?\u201d asked the study\u2019s authors. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2014/nov/12/algorithms-race-discrimination-uber-lyft-airbnb-peer\">The sharing economy is not as open as you might think</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cDiscrimination has no place in society, and no place on Uber,\u201d Uber\u2019s head of North American operations, Rachel Holt, said in a statement. \u201cWe believe Uber is helping reduce transportation inequities across the board, but studies like this one are helpful in thinking about how we can do even more.\u201d</p> <p>Lyft spokesman Adrian Durbin said in a statement: \u201cWe are extremely proud of the positive impact Lyft has on communities of color.

However, disappointingly, it does not set any milestones in terms of meeting the government\u2019s important commitment to halve the disability employment gap.\u201d</p> <p>Mark Atkinson, chief executive at disability charity Scope, welcomed the green paper but said it must lead to concrete action. \u201cDisabled people are twice as likely as the general public to be unemployed. For this consultation to succeed it must lead to real changes in policy, legislation and employer attitudes.\u201d <br></p> <p>The Labour chairman of the Commons work and pensions committee, Frank Field, said: \u201cPeople with disabilities have been among those least well-served by jobcentres and welfare-to-work programmes in recent years. All too often, having a health condition or disability means dropping out of work and struggling to return. <br></p> <p>\u201cThe committee welcomes the government\u2019s ambition to support people into work faster and more sustainably. Equally important is the review of the work capability assessment, which for too long has been a source of anxiety and fear for disabled people. <br></p> <p>\u201cGetting this right is key not just to ensuring that disabled people get the support they need, but also to building confidence that the department has their best interests at heart.\u201d</p>",

in the summer of 2018, but he has the option to stick in the job for another three years.</p> <p>Some pro-Brexit politicians have heaped heavy criticism on Carney, saying he was discredited for being unduly pessimistic about leaving the EU.</p> <p>But earlier today, Theresa May\u2019s spokeswoman gave him a resounding endorsement, saying:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cIt is clearly a decision for him, but the PM would certainly be supportive of him going on beyond his five years.</p> <p>The PM has always had a good working relationship with the governor of the Bank of England and

And recent events suggests he may have a fine grasp of the dark arts of political spin.</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/10/31/mark-carney-hasnt-just-played-a-political-game-hes-won-it-hands/\">The Telegraph\u2019s James Kirkup argues</a> that Carney has played a blinder this month, by using the attacks from Brexit supporters to spark a debate about his future.</p> <p>The key to the saga is Carney\u2019s declaration last week that his decision on whether to stay or go in 2018 was \u201centirely personal\u201d. That sent the hare running.... and it got a second burst of speed when various Carney \u2018friends\u2019 suggested he was leaning towards a return to Canada.</p> <p>Kirkup explains how Carney outfoxed his detractors within Theresa May\u2019s government: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Before the row over his ideological commitment to Brexit blew up, there was a perfectly respectable question to be asked about Mr Carney\u2019s future based on his competence as a central banker. Some of his policies, especially \u201cforward guidance\u201d about rates, have been less than impressive, leading to confusion instead of the clarity he promised.</p> <p>But the Carney-bashers have allowed that debate to shift from economics into politics, an arena where Mr Carney does rather well. He understood that Mrs May could not afford to have markets and investors (and even some voters) see Brexit Britain as the sort of country where the central bank governor can be purged for failing to pass a political purity test. </p> <p>Simply, it might (just) have been viable to let Mr Carney go for being incompetent, but it wasn\u2019t sensible to do so for reasons of politics. The Governor saw that and upped the ante accordingly: he could afford to walk away; could Britain afford to have him go?</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/jameskirkup/status/793092190746599428\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Mark Carney hasn&#39;t just played a political game, he&#39;s won it hands down <a href=\"https://t.co/DysNcGVOMT\">https://t.co/DysNcGVOMT</a> via <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TelegraphNews\">@telegraphnews</a></p>&mdash; James Kirkup (@jameskirkup) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jameskirkup/status/793092190746599428\">October 31, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-581751a8e4b0219a00d3a9e4\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-31T14:19:01.101Z\">2.19pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here\u2019s our latest news story on Mark Carney\u2019s future, by economics editor Larry Elliott: </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/31/theresa-may-support-mark-carney-full-term-bank-of-england-governor\">May backs Carney to serve full term as Bank of England governor</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58174ea7e4b01c528432e9c4\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-31T14:12:54.621Z\">2.12pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">A quick catch-up</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Right, let\u2019s quickly recap before Mark Carney emerges from his meeting at Number 10 Downing Street.</strong></p> <p>The future of Britain\u2019s central bank chief could be decided soon, following a weekend of speculation that has gripped the City.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/oct/31/mark-carney-bank-of-england-speculation-eurozone-gdp-business-live?page=with:block-5816f394e4b08d944ba4c7f7#block-5816f394e4b08d944ba4c7f7\">Mark Carney is meeting with Theresa May now, less than a day after the Financial Times reported that he was ready to serve another three years as Bank of England governor</a></strong>.</p> <p>Theresa May\u2019s spokeswoman has already signalled that the government backs Carney, following several days of criticism from politicians who campaigned for Brexit.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/oct/31/mark-carney-bank-of-england-speculation-eurozone-gdp-business-live?page=with:block-58172d71e4b01c528432e925#block-58172d71e4b01c528432e925\">The spokeswoman said that Carney was \u201cabsolutely\u201d the right man to run the BoE, saying</a></strong>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The PM has been clear in her support for the governor, the work he is doing for the country.

Whichever one you take, it\u2019s either \u00a331bn or \u00a32bn more than the minimum they said was needed.\u201d</p> <p>But Stephen Dorrell, the former Conservative health secretary who now chairs the NHS Confederation, said: \u201cIt is misleading to suggest the NHS budget is being protected when the same is not true of social care and public health.\u201d </p> <p>The coalition government pledged in April 2015 to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/apr/10/george-osborne-conservative-party-election-pledge-extra-8bn-nhs\">give the NHS \u00a38bn more</a> between 2016-17 and 2020-21. Ministers now say they are boosting the NHS budget by \u00a310bn but admit that comes from including a \u00a32bn rise that was already planned. </p> <p>Health thinktanks say the NHS England chief executive, Simon Stevens, has made clear that it is not due to receive the extra money he believes it needs between 2017-18 and 2019-20, and so May and Hunt\u2019s claims that the NHS is getting all the money it requested are false. </p> <p>Dr Sarah Wollaston, the Conservative MP who chairs the select committee, welcomed Hunt\u2019s acknowledgement that the \u00a310bn figure was based on one year more than the five years over which the \u00a38bn was due to arrive and money being taken from other parts of the health budget. But the committee\u2019s criticisms were accurate, despite Hunt\u2019s rejection of them, she said.

A <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/10/clinton-emails-comey-poll-politico-morning-consult-230519\">Morning Consult/Politico poll</a> carried out after the announcement put Clinton three points ahead, while a CBS/YouGov survey of likely voters in 13 battleground states showed that only 1% of Clinton supporters were less likely to vote for her as a consequence.</p> <p>Trump claimed on Monday that the FBI had stumbled across a digital \u201cmother lode\u201d and predicted they would discover missing work-related emails that had been deleted from Clinton\u2019s computers.</p> <p>\u201c650,000 [emails]? \u2026 I think you are going to find the 33,000 that are missing,\u201d he told supporters in Michigan. \u201cI think we hit the mother lode, as they say in the mining industry.\u201d</p> <p>Trump urged Comey to resist political pressure. \u201cHe\u2019s gotta hang tough because a lot of people think he did the wrong thing, but he did the right thing,\u201d he told the Grand Rapids rally. \u201cI was not his fan but what he did he brought back his reputation.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt took guts for director Comey to do what he did,\u201d he added, to chants of \u201clock her up\u201d from the crowd.</p> <p>Trump has seized on signs of momentum to push into once-safe Democratic territory in the industrial mid-west. He was also due to speak in Warren in Michigan on Monday before appearing with running mate Mike Pence in Eau Claire, Wisconsin, on Tuesday.</p> <p>Until his polling gap began to narrow again last week, Trump had been forced back to a dwindling number of swing states, while Clinton eyed Republican territory in Utah, Arizona and Georgia. Renewed optimism among Republicans has created an unusually vast national battleground, particularly as Trump\u2019s economic populism scrambles traditional demographic dividing lines. </p> <p>Michigan and Wisconsin have both been hit hard by the loss of manufacturing jobs and were the scene of surprise defeats for Clinton in the Democratic primary, when large numbers of blue-collar workers favoured Bernie Sanders. Signs of Democratic nervousness in Wisconsin became apparent last week when the Clinton campaign suddenly announced an advertising blitz. Sanders has been dispatched to help campaign for Clinton in the state on Wednesday.</p> <p>The impact of early voting may also be forcing Trump to look further afield. States such as a North Carolina have seen heavy early turnout among Democrats and may be relatively immune from any late swing away from Clinton.</p> <p>If he cannot win North Carolina but picks up Florida and Ohio, Trump\u2019s best hope of pulling off a shock victory will rely on either rustbelt states like Michigan and Wisconsin or, in the north-east, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania and Maine.</p> <p>Clinton is redoubling her efforts.

The city saw a spike in drug-related deaths last year of 15%, particularly among older long-term addicts.</p> <p>The Glasgow City Integration Joint Board, which includes council leaders, local police commanders and health board officials, also approved in principle a plan to offer clean medical\u2013grade heroin to some users at the same site. </p> <p>\u201cGiven the scale and persistence of public injecting in Glasgow, these problems are likely to persist or worsen unless new approaches to harm-reduction are considered,\u201d the committee was told by the Glasgow City Alcohol and Drugs Partnership, which is leading on the project. </p> <p>The proposals, which still need a detailed business case, costings and an operational plan to be agreed, met with hostility from some drugs experts and clear signs of scepticism from Scotland\u2019s chief law officer, the lord advocate, James Wolffe, and Scottish ministers.</p> <p>The backers of the scheme admitted that setting up a fix room would need special legal approval from the lord advocate to make it compliant with the Misuse of Drugs Act 1972. Without any exemption from prosecution, addicts could find themselves risking arrest for using the facility. </p> <p>The lord advocate\u2019s officials were irritated by claims in an official report on the proposals that \u201cdiscussions to allow the proposals to proceed are at an advanced stage\u201d with both the Crown Office and Scottish government. That was rejected by both bodies, with sources indicating that their involvement in the scheme was at a very early stage and their support not guaranteed.</p> <p>A Crown Office spokesman said: \u201cThe lord advocate will carefully consider any detailed proposal [that] is made, taking into account the public health and criminal justice implications.\u201d</p> <p>Aileen Campbell, the public health minister, said this plan was not being backed by Scottish ministers and, before it could go ahead, it needed legal authority from the lord advocate. \u201cThe Scottish government has no plans to introduce drug consumption rooms or heroin-assisted treatment,\u201d she said.</p> <p>The committee was told there was a clear economic and social case for the scheme, which has been mooted in the past for Brighton and Doncaster. Fix rooms were in widespread use in Europe, Canada and Australia, with that international evidence \u201cconsistently demonstrating the highly cost-effective nature of both safer consumption facilities and heroin-assisted treatment services\u201d.</p> <p>It reduced risky injecting behaviour; minimised harm from overdoses; increased addicts\u2019 access to preventative healthcare; and cut criminal activity. That reduced costs for hospitals, GPs services, policing and the city generally. </p> <p>In a statement Susanne Millar, chair of the city\u2019s alcohol and drug partnership, said the go-ahead \u201cenables us to build a robust business case [that] will support this service. We believe it will improve the health of the target population as well as benefit local communities and businesses that are currently adversely affected by public injecting\u201d. The scheme is being backed by an influential drug-users charity, the Scottish Drugs Forum. </p> <p>But Professor Neil McKeganey, an expert in drugs policy with the <a href=\"http://substanceuseresearch.org/\">Centre for Substance Use Research</a> in Glasgow, said the scheme was highly flawed. There was a clear risk it would fail to cut heroin abuse and deaths: there was no clear evidence it would work. The same promises had been made for widespread access to methadone as a heroin replacement but that had failed, he said.</p> <p>McKeganey was dubious that workers in this unit would have the skills or inclination to pass drug users on to projects to help them quit heroin. The fast majority of addicts wanted to become entirely clean, he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit like going to McDonalds and expecting a referral to Burger King,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is entirely legitimate to ask for the evidence that this scheme is going to work effectively, and in Glasgow.\u201d</p>",

They claim legalization of recreational cannabis is a disaster which has failed to deliver the much promised tax windfall and turned the state into a haven for smugglers. Above all, critics say, statistics show a sharp rise in drug use by teenagers, in fatal car accidents involving drivers under the influence of cannabis and of hospitals treating overdoses.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The marijuana industry is taking pages out of the tobacco industry\u2019s playbook</p> <footer> <cite>Kevin Sabet, drug policy adviser</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cIf this was a virus or alcohol, anybody looking at those numbers would be alarmed,\u201d said Tom Gorman director of the Rocky Mountain High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area (RMHIDTA), a federal anti-drug program covering four states in the region. \u201cWhy are we not alarmed by this?\u201d</p> <p>Far from being alarmed, opinion polls suggest support for legalization <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.denverpost.com/2016/09/20/legalize-marijuana-poll/\">has held up in Colorado</a> where combined sales of recreational and medical cannabis are up by more than 40%, to nearly $1bn over the past two years.</p> <p>That has forced opponents to focus on a different target: the corporate interests making millions from cannabis.

Advocates for legalization did not need a dope head with a string of drug convictions as the face of the new freedom. So they chose Sean Azzariti, a marine corps veteran with two tours in Iraq behind him, to make history.</p> <p>Azzariti was ushered to the front of the queue at the 3D Cannabis Center in Denver, past people from as far as Virginia and Ohio, to buy a bag of weed and a marijuana-laced truffle.</p> <p>\u201cI felt bad because there were people who had camped out all night and I just went in,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s something I never thought I would do, especially being in the Marine Corps for six years and it\u2019s very anti-marijuana and anti-drugs.

Azzariti said legalization \u201cwould give veterans safer access to marijuana\u201d and that they shouldn\u2019t face criminal charges for cope with the consequences of combat.</p> <p>Andrew Freedman, the state\u2019s first director of marijuana coordination, a position in the governor\u2019s office, said characterizing legalization as a civil rights issue was a deciding factor in the 2012 vote in favor of legalization by a public weary of the failed \u201cwar on drugs\u201d and prosecutions.</p> <p>\u201cWithin the first year there was an 80% decrease in marijuana-related prosecutions,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Arrest rates were already dropping with decriminalization and growth of the medical marijuana industry, but it was still possible to fall afoul of laws on use in public and distribution, which could have life-altering consequences.</p> <p>The new laws in Colorado and Oregon provide relief for people with criminal convictions for what is now legal. In August, Jordan Visarraga applied to have his record expunged with the help of legal volunteers in Portland. Four years ago, Visarraga was 18 and in his last year of high school, with offers of football scholarships at three universities, when he was arrested for possession of marijuana. Because he was caught with the drugs within 1,000ft of a school, Visarraga was convicted of a felony.

But a number of polling and election law experts cast doubts on the methodology and suggested the process could be a smokescreen for voter intimidation. </p> <p>For months, Donald Trump has warned supporters of a \u201crigged election\u201d and encouraged them to monitor polling areas in cities such as St Louis, Chicago and Philadelphia. The lawsuits, filed by state Democratic parties in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Arizona and Nevada, would cover many of the cities Stone said he intended to target. </p> <p>The filings argue that such efforts, along with Trump\u2019s rhetoric, could violate both the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which outlawed discriminatory voting practices in the American south, and the Ku Klux Klan Act of 1871, which outlawed intimidation against African American voters. </p> <p>Election law experts said it was unclear whether courts would issue a broad order, as requested in the filings, to simply prevent voter intimidation, but they could look in more detail at the temporary restraining order requested against Stone\u2019s exit polling. </p> <p>\u201cIt could be useful in getting the word out about these activities, and secondly getting the [Republican state] parties and [Trump] campaign on record saying they will not engage in these activities,\u201d said Rick Hasen, an election law expert at the University of California whose <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://electionlawblog.org/?p=88351\">Election Law blog first reported the lawsuits on Monday</a>. </p> <p>The Republican National Committee has been under a consent decree since the 1981 gubernatorial election in New Jersey, when the group sent armed off-duty law enforcement officers to patrol polls in minority neighborhoods.

The organisation is still encouraging its volunteers to livestream video from polling stations. </p> <p>In an emailed statement, Stone dismissed the lawsuits as \u201cwithout merit\u201d and argued the lawyers who filed them \u201ccould face sanctions\u201d.

  "<p>Almost exactly 499 years ago, when he fastened his 95 theses to the door of the church in Wittenberg, Martin Luther set in motion the cascade of argument, then formal schism, war and revolution that we know as the Reformation. Latin Christianity had been the language in which Europe talked to itself for the preceding 1,000 years. Now it was to become the language in which Europe fought with itself. The consequence was the modern world. The savage religious wars of the 16th and 17th centuries gave birth to the nation state. The vernacular bibles of the Reformation shaped and fixed the languages in which they were printed. The struggles of European nations became global and their empires spread Christianity around the world.</p> <p>And now, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/29/reformation-luther-pope-francis-catholics\" title=\"\">the European centuries are over</a>. An Argentinian Jesuit pope is visiting a female archbishop who heads the Lutheran Church of Sweden, one of the most secularised countries in the most secularised continent in the world. This would have been almost unimaginable half a century ago. The Reformation is finally over in Europe, not because either side has won, but because both&#xa0;sides have been overcome with exhaustion and brushed to the margins of history by their apparent irrelevance.</p> <p>Churchgoing is collapsing; the proposed EU constitution of 2005 chose not to acknowledge that Europe had Christian roots, let alone suggest that it might have a Christian present or future. For 500 years, Christians, when <a href=\"http://www.ccel.org/f/foxe/martyrs/home.html\" title=\"\">they wished to be frightened</a> by the thought of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Clitherow\" title=\"\">a truly dangerous</a> and contagiously misleading religion, would think of the churches on the other side of the Reformation divide. Now they are more likely to be frightened and repelled by Islam.</p> <p>Nevertheless, Christianity remains a global force. There are more than two billion Christians. In large parts of Africa and Latin America, where the state has failed or is failing, organised Christianity remains as important as it was in Europe 500 years ago. Pope Francis is the head of the largest healthcare organisation in the world, and possibly the largest educational organisation too. Even in the western world there are still many places where traditional Christianity is morally and politically important. Poland is governed by a strongly Catholic, populist and nationalist party. Orthodox Christianity lends a heroic cast to the squalid crimes of Vladimir Putin. The votes of white evangelicals may yet give Donald Trump the presidency. All over Europe, the word Christianity is once more waved as a crusading banner.</p> <p>Yet the revulsion that we feel against those forms of Christianity itself derives from Christian thought and practice. The welfare states, which seem to have replaced the social functions of Christianity, had deep and often explicit Christian roots, as do the ideals of secular democracy. You need only look at Greek or Roman attitudes to slavery, genocide, or even infanticide to realise what a revolution Christianity brought into the world, and how this change has shaped modern, secular Europe.</p> <p>The great question confronting Europe now is whether the values of liberal democracy can sustain themselves. Through the fat years when religion faded it seemed that an appeal to reason and self-interest was enough. In&#xa0;the age of Trump, of Brexit, and the Polish Law and Justice party it is obvious that it is not. Emotion and imagination are needed too, and these are the qualities that make up spirituality. Without a belief that human rights are a way of talking about objective reality, and that morality \u2013 however disputed \u2013 is a matter of fact and not of preference, the web of trust and decency that holds our societies together could be ripped to shreds.</p> <p>We can\u2019t go back. The old model of state churches is dead or dying everywhere today. But something must replace it soon, or we may find that the French novelist Andr\u00e9 Malraux (who fought against the Catholic side in the Spanish civil war) was right when he predicted that this century would be religious \u2013 or it would not be at all.</p>",

As the responsible adults in children\u2019s lives, we need to be sure they are getting accurate, impartial information that doesn\u2019t sensationalise or scaremonger. At First News, the weekly national newspaper for children, we give the background to stories and put them in context. This makes even the most frightening news stories less scary to children and helps them to decipher between the fact and the fiction. Children should not be sheltered from the news but given the support they need to properly understand what they might hear in the playground or read online.

Clark replied:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It seems to me why would you not aim as a matter of negotiation to avoid bureaucratic impediments. That seems to me common sense.

Clark replied:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>What I was able to say is how you would go into a negotiation. That seems to me to find common ground.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>Clark suggested that the government could seek different trading arrangements with the EU for different sectors of the economy. </strong>He also implied there was a regional element to this.<strong> </strong>In response to a question from the Labour chair of the Commons business committee, <strong>Iain Wright,</strong> Clark said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It seems to that the the approach - not only that I intend to take, but that I am already taking - with the firms that are in our economy is to take time to meet them to understand the different needs of different sectors, so that we can be informed by them, as we form our negotiating mandate. It will be different from sector to sector. That\u2019s obviously the case. </p> <p>My commitment, which we will share when we meet in his committee, is through our industrial strategy to make sure that we not only have confidence for individual sectors, but individual places as well. Because there is a very interesting confluence there, and I think the investment in Nissan is good for the sector, and good for Sunderland and the North East.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Hilary Benn</strong>, the Labour chair of the Commons Brexit committee, later put it to Clark that his reply to Wright implied some sectors of the economy might be offered tariff-free trade with the EU while others would not.

He told MPs:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Through many conversations I, and my colleagues had, here and in Japan, it became clear that four reassurances were important to securing the investment for Britain.</p> <p>Three were about the automotive sector generally and one was about Brexit.</p> <p>These were</p> <p>1 - That we would continue our successful and longstanding programme of support for the competitiveness of the automotive sector, including Nissan.</p> <p>This support is available to firms for skills and training of the local workforce, for research and development and innovation \u2013 in line with EU and UK government rules.</p> <p>Since 2010 the government has invested \u00a3400m into the UK automotive sector in this way and we will continue to invest hundreds of millions more over the coming years.</p> <p>All proposals of course \u2013 from any company \u2013 must be underpinned by strong business cases and tested against published eligibility criteria. All proposals are subject to rigorous external scrutiny by the Independent Industrial Development Advisory Board and are reported on to parliament.</p> <p>2 - We would continue our work with the automotive sector, including Nissan at Sunderland, to ensure that more of the supply chain can locate in the UK, and in close proximity to the major manufacturing sites. In a previous post I established the local growth deals and the city deals which working with Local Enterprise Partnerships, have provided a way in which local councils, businesses and the government can upgrade the sites, especially sites brought into use from dereliction, and to provide the infrastructure for small and medium-sized businesses that can supply these major companies. This programme I can confirm will continue and with vigour</p> <p>3 - We would maintain a strong commitment to research and development and in particular to the take-up of ultra-low emission vehicles. The opportunities presented by bringing the energy and climate change department together with the business department make us ideally placed to build on Britain\u2019s strengths in low carbon energy, the automotive sector, in science and research and many other areas</p> <p>4 - In our negotiations to leave the EU we will emphasise the very strong common ground there is especially in the automotive sector between ourselves and other EU member states in ensuring that trade between us can be free and unencumbered by impediments.</p> <p>A good deal for the UK can also be a good deal for other member states, and that is how we will approach the negotiations. Whatever the outcome we are determined to ensure that the UK continues to be one of the most competitive locations in the world for automotive and other advanced manufacturing.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58178800e4b08d944ba4cb48\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-31T18:06:26.903Z\">6.06pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Back in the Commons <strong>Greg Clark</strong> says that the Brexit talks have not started, but that the demeanour the government should adopt should be to seek common ground and common interests with EU partners.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58178707e4b0219a00d3ab23\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-31T18:05:42.254Z\">6.05pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Mark Carney to stay on as Bank of England governor until 2019</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Turning away from Greg Clark for a moment, it has just been announced that Mark Carney will stay on as governor of the Bank of England until 2019.

Nissan announced last week <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/27/nissan-to-make-new-qashqai-and-x-trail-models-in-britain\">that it would build the next Qashqai and X-Trail models at Sunderland </a>after receiving assurances from the government that it would not lose out from Brexit. Clark has not published the letter the government gave to Nissan that helped secure the investment, but he spoke about the assurances in some detail yesterday in an interview that shed considerable light on how the government will approach Brexit.</p> <p>Over the summer, and at the Conservative conference, Theresa May suggested that her Brexit priority would be getting control of immigration, even if that meant limiting access to the single market. Clark\u2019s comments yesterday suggested that in recent weeks there may have been something of a rethink, because<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/30/nissan-eu-tariff-free-brexit-sunderland\"> he implied Downing Street want a free trade relationship similar to the single market and customs union.</a></p> <p>Clark\u2019s interview has already prompted much analysis. Here are three articles worth reading.</p> <ul> <li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/30/greg-clark-brexit-negotiations-andrew-marr-show-nissan-auto-industry\"><strong>Patrick Wintour in the Guardian says Clark suggested the government was going for a sector-by-sector deal.</strong></a></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Describing his talks with Nissan executives, Clark told Marr: \u201cWhat I said was that our objective would be to ensure that we would have continued access to the markets in Europe \u2013 and vice-versa \u2013 without tariffs and without bureaucratic impediments and that is how we will approach those negotiations.</p> <p>\u201cFor the continental European car manufacturers, they export a lot to us, we export a lot to them, components go backwards and forwards. If you conduct the negotiations in a serious, constructive and civilised way there is a lot in common that we can establish. I was able to reassure Nissan \u2013 and other manufacturers \u2013 that that is the way we are going to approach it.\u201d</p> <p>This implies that the business department regards access to the EU single market must at the least be set alongside control of migration and UK borders as a negotiating objective.</p> <p>The aim, according to one minister, is for the outcome to feel like the UK is in the EU single market without being a member.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong><a href=\"http://labour-uncut.co.uk/2016/10/30/nissan-might-have-got-the-headlines-last-week-but-the-real-story-is-whats-bubbling-on-free-movement/#more-21170\">Atul Hatwal at Labour Uncut says he thinks the Nissan deal means the government is going to compromise on free movement.</a></strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There is absolutely zero chance that Monsieur Barnier would permit the UK to have one of the things it prizes the most \u2013 the automotive single market\u2013 without extracting a concession on the issue that exercises Central and Eastern European states the most: migration.</p> <p>Some of the animus among the Visegrad, Baltic and Balkan nations will be assuaged with direct financial contributions from Britain but a blanket ban on free movement is politically impossible in the EU.</p> <p>The firmness of Britain\u2019s commitments to Nissan mean that the British government knows that it has to accept a compromise on this issue.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5817779fe4b08d944ba4caca\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-31T16:56:58.247Z\">4.56pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here is the full statement from <strong>Diane Abbott</strong>, the shadow home secretary, on the Orgreave announcement.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The victims and their families have been treated shamefully by this government.</p> <p>The campaigners were led to believe only that there was debate on the form of Inquiry, but Amber Rudd and Theresa May have led them up them up the garden path.</p> <p>The South Yorkshire police chief constable is in favour of an inquiry, as are many stakeholders, and of course the campaigners themselves.</p> <p>The current and previous home secretaries both indicated that an Inquiry would be granted.</p> <p>This is a shameful decision, which ignores the need for truth and justice.</p> <p>Labour stands with the campaigners and will not rest until there is a full Hillsborough-style inquiry.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5817773ce4b08d944ba4cac7\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-31T16:54:38.818Z\">4.54pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here is a Guardian video of Labour MPs responding to Amber Rudd\u2019s Commons statement.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/oct/31/orgreave-inquiry-burnham-accuses-rudd-of-nakedly-political-act-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/5a7vd\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2859151\"            data-video-name=\"Orgreave inquiry: Burnham accuses Rudd of \u2018nakedly political act\u2019 \u2013\u00a0video\"            data-video-provider=\"Parliament TV\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-58176cade4b01c528432ea79\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/10/31/161031rudd_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/10/31/161031rudd.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/10/31/161031rudd_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/oct/31/orgreave-inquiry-burnham-accuses-rudd-of-nakedly-political-act-video\">Orgreave inquiry: Burnham accuses Rudd of \u2018nakedly political act\u2019 \u2013 video</a></figcaption> </figure>  </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-581775cae4b01c528432eabc\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-31T16:52:43.769Z\">4.52pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here is some more political reaction to Amber Rudd\u2019s decision not to hold an inquiry into Orgreave.</p> <p>From <strong>Nick Clegg</strong>, the former Lib Dem leader and former deputy prime minister and a Sheffield MP</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/nick_clegg/status/793117883043807232\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Questions over Orgreave continue to undermine public trust in SY police.

This is a very important consideration when looking at the necessity for an inquiry or independent review and the public interest to be derived from holding one.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>She says policing has changed \u201cfundamentally\u201d since 1994, and she implies this makes it very unlikely that the Orgreave events could happen again.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There have been very significant changes in the oversight of policing since 1984, at every level, including major reforms to criminal procedure, changes to public order policing and practice, stronger external scrutiny and greater local accountability.</p> <p>The operational delivery and practice of public order policing has moved on a great deal from the arrangements in 1984, and tactics have now been reviewed and altered several times both by the police and the courts.</p> <p>Protections which were singularly lacking at the time of Orgreave now exist with the introduction in the mid-80s of the Police &amp; Criminal Evidence Act which has vastly improved the way police investigations and powers operate.</p> <p>The creation of the Crown Prosecution Service in 1986, with the introduction of independent CPS prosecutors, fundamentally altered the prosecution of offences. It ended the existence of ad hoc prosecution arrangements across the country whereby a mixture of police prosecutors and private firms of solicitors - hired by the police and acting for and on the instruction of the police \u2013 conducted prosecutions.</p> <p>With regards to the external scrutiny of complaints against the police, this was strengthened by the creation, in 1985, of the Police Complaints Authority which was replaced in 2004 by the more effective Independent Police Complaints Commission and in turn will be replaced by the Office for Police Conduct in 2017. The exemplary standards of behaviour expected of everyone who works in policing were reinforced by the introduction of a statutory Code of Ethics, laid before this House in 2014.</p> <p>Lastly, the introduction of directly elected Police and Crime Commissioners in 2012 has given the public a voice in shaping their local policing priorities and improved the accountability of police leadership.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>She says she is not convinced that a proper investigation into Orgreave at the time would have prevented the Hillsborough tragedy.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The campaigners say that had the consequences of the events at Orgreave been addressed properly at the time, the tragic events at Hillsborough would never have happened five years later.

He told the programme:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The point I have made in response to that is that\u2019s precisely what the Hillsborough families were offered in 1998.

He said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>For all those people who were originally attracted to Zac Goldsmith as a modern, idealist, attractive, faintly glamorous ... minor royal, for those people, if you look back to his demeanour (when he was first elected), I think many people will be gobsmacked that he\u2019s now Nigel Farage\u2019s favoured candidate.</p> </blockquote> <p>The Lib Dems projected an aura of confidence about their chances with Olney declaring her chances of winning at 10/10. She said it could not be a referendum on Heathrow as there was no candidate in favour of a third runway while Clegg said Goldsmith had been unable to stop the government taking the Heathrow decision when a Tory so would be even less influential as an independent. He recalled:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>All the hours and hours I spoke to David Cameron and George Osborne (about Heathrow)... Goldsmith\u2019s name never came up.

He was one of Nigel Farage\u2019s chief advisers in the run-up to the 2015 and was credited/blamed for encouraging Farage to adopt increasingly hard right positions, especially on immigration. When he announced his leadership bid he seemed an unlikely candidate, partly because of his age (30) but more because <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/ukip-leadership-frontrunner-raheem-kassam-nicola-sturgeon-twitter-apology_uk_5813943de4b0672ea688ddc0\">his Twitter feed is littered with offensive comments that make Donald Trump sound diplomatic, </a>but he campaigned energetically, and was good at generating publicity. Given the internal dynamics of Ukip, his decision to withdraw from the contest may be more significant than it looks.</p> <p>Here are three takeaways from the announcement.</p> <p><strong>1 - Paul Nuttall is now even firmer favourite to win than he was.</strong> His main rival is Suzanne Evans, the party\u2019s former deputy chairwoman. Evans is a strong media performer but, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/29/suzanne-evans-gaping-hole-in-british-politics-for-ukip\">as her interview with the Guardian at the weekend showed,</a> one many issues her views don\u2019t square with traditional Ukip thinking.

Kassam, a former aide to Nigel Farage who was running as the continuity Farage candidate, was always a relative outsider, and in a statement he says he is suspending his campaign because he has decided he cannot win.</p> <p>Paul Nuttall, the former deputy Ukip leader, was already the strong favourite, and Kassam\u2019s move means his chances of winning are now even higher.</p> <p>Here is his statement in full.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><strong>As of today, I am formally suspending my campaign for UKIP leader.</strong></p> <p>After much consideration, I have decided not to pursue my campaign to be UKIP leader any further. This was a very difficult decision, and I want to thank everyone who supported me in the process.</p> <p>It is a decision I have not taken lightly, but following meetings this weekend I realised the path to victory is too narrow. <strong>I would encourage my supporters to back Peter Whittle, who I think would make a fantastic leader of the party.</strong></p> <p>On their own, the following issues would not have caused me to take this decision, but taken together, the following reasons created an impossible route forward for me: </p> <p><strong>1. The top of the party is treating this like a coronation:</strong> I am not satisfied about the integrity of the process, and having put a number of complaints in to the party chairman, I was disappointed that incidents whereby Members of the European Parliament are using party databases to effectively campaign against me \u2013 ostensibly against the rules \u2013 were not challenged.</p> <p><strong>2. Disgraceful treatment by the media: </strong>I am tough and I can take it, but when<em>Times</em> journalists show up at my elderly parents\u2019 house at dusk, intimidating them, I draw the line. Billy Kenber at the <em>Times</em> has a lot to answer for and I will be pursuing a harassment complaint further.</p> <p><strong>3. Fundraising:</strong> While we raised enough for our deposit, and got over 200 assentors to my nomination, we could not raise enough for this to be more than a digital campaign run from SW1, and to not feature at events all around the country would have made me a hypocrite, given how much I criticise the establishment for ignoring the country.</p> <p>Over the next few weeks I will be providing a statement of accounts for all my donors, and in-keeping with my money pledge on my website, I will be giving them the choice as to what happens with the remainder of the money they donated. I will suggest we either: donate to the Royal British Legion or Help for Heroes, donate to the party, donate to Peter Whittle\u2019s campaign. Those who want refunds are welcome to contact me.</p> <p>I wish the UK Independence Party and whoever its new leader is all the best in ensuring Brexit happens, and in the upcoming electoral tests next year. I remain commited to the causes of the UK Independence Party, but sadly, at this campaign, it was a bridge too far for us.</p> <p>I will be continuing at my job as Editor in Chief of Breitbart London, returning to the United States this week to cover the last leg of the presidential elections.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-10-31T09:59:30.064Z\">at 9.59am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-58171022e4b0219a00d3a8b9\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-31T09:36:25.031Z\">9.36am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>NHS Providers,</strong> a group representing hospitals, has put out <a href=\"https://www.nhsproviders.org/news-blogs/news/time-has-come-for-a-new-financial-settlement-for-the-nhs-and-social-care\">a statement backing what the MPs from the health committee are saying. </a>This is from Chris Hopson, its chief executive.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We share the health committee\u2019s concerns that short term pressures, combined with cuts to public health, social care and capital funding, risk overwhelming the NHS\u2019 ability to provide the quality of care we all want when funding increases significantly tail off from 2017/18 onwards.

She told the programme.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Well, it\u2019s only technically correct if you\u2019re looking at spending on NHS England and you add an extra year to the spending review and you also take account of the switch from other budgets that we would normally think of as health spending. So, for example, you can only arrive at the \u00a310bn by shifting money from public health budgets and from health education and training, and also by changing the date at which you calculate real terms increases. So, yes, you can see how they have arrived at the figure. But the real figure we feel should be quoted at \u00a34.5bn which is considerably less ... That\u2019s over the period of the spending review and that\u2019s the period that we usually talk about increases in spending. We wouldn\u2019t normally, say for other government departments, just add an extra year.</p> </blockquote> <p>She also rejected the claim that Simon Stevens, NHS England\u2019s chief executive, has said that the government has given him what he wants. In fact, health spending is due to fall on a per head basis towards the end of this parliament, she said.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>[Stevens] was very clear when he came before our committee during our inquiry that if you look at the middle years, next year and the year after, we are going to be seeing a far more constrained situation, and certainly not what he asked for. So, certainly, for 2018-19 we will be seeing a per capita fall in funding for the NHS at a time when our demographics [are changing], the increase in older people, a 21% increase in the number of people over 65 in the last decade up to 2015.</p> </blockquote> <p>Here is a clip from Wollaston\u2019s interview.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/BBCr4today/status/792994381645148160\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">&#39;Government wrong on NHS spending&#39; - <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sarahwollaston\">@sarahwollaston</a> says actual figure \u00a34.5bn rather than \u00a310bn they have claimed <a href=\"https://t.co/BfALjw4bMg\">https://t.co/BfALjw4bMg</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/BVT6qNe3F2\">pic.twitter.com/BVT6qNe3F2</a></p>&mdash; BBC Radio 4 Today (@BBCr4today) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BBCr4today/status/792994381645148160\">October 31, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>I will report more on this if the story moves on.</p> <p>Otherwise, it\u2019s a patchy day.

I looked out into the room from the bed and I saw a man who looked to be in his thirties or forties, in overalls and with thick black hair slicked back at the top. He was just standing there staring at me intently and I intuited that he was checking me out because he knew I would be the one to have a baby with his grandson.</p> <p>A month or so later, I travelled to Maine with my husband to meet his parents for the first time. That first evening, his mother handed me a family album and the first photo was an 8x10 black and white of the man I saw that night standing in the room, and it was my mother-in-law\u2019s father. </p> <p>I felt a bit relieved that my experience was validated. I didn\u2019t tell my future mother-in-law about it but I did tell my husband who neither negated my experience nor bought it wholesale. I enjoy sharing the story today as it was an important moment for me when it happened and still amazes me.<br></p> <p>Since this experience in I have had one more run-in with this spirit in the same house. In 2015, I was sleeping in the same room when I was poked hard in the back waking me up. When I woke, I saw that my young daughter was about to fall off the bed and would have hit her head on the corner of a table. I believe he was looking out for us. </p> <p>The few people I\u2019ve told think it\u2019s pretty amazing. I don\u2019t tell a lot of people but the ones who know have never doubted my experience and are open to the idea of an afterlife. <br></p> <h2>\u2018I wonder if I dreamt it all but I know I was awake\u2019 \u2013 Den Brimmell, Wolverhampton</h2> <p>It was 1976, and I was 13 years old. I was sleeping out in my back garden in an old four man scout tent with some school friends. I woke around 5am to find a young blonde boy had his head stuck through the door of the tent looking at me. It was early and I was tired, so I thought it was my brother who was blond but as he was only nine at the time he was sleeping in the house. Later that day, I asked my brother what he was doing up so early and he denied all knowledge and said he was in bed.</p> <p>A week or so later, I was camping in the garden with my mates when I woke up early again and saw this blond child sitting cross-legged on my friends head who was fast asleep. Being a teenager, ignored it and went back to sleep! None of my friends ever mentioned anything strange to me, so I guess they never saw anything.</p> <p>I pretty much forgot about it and never mentioned the second experience to anyone, until I was talking with my brother in the late 1980\u2019s and, out of the blue, mentioned that he and his mates had camped out in the garden and one of them had asked him next morning who the blonde kid was who kept looking at them through the tent door and had been walking around the garden!</p> <p>That tent had a loop and eyelet fastening for the door which meant that it was difficult to slide a hand in when it was shut from inside, let alone a head! I still live in the house but have not seen the blonde kid since. </p> <p>I live in my parents old 2 bed semi, on a council estate in Wolverhampton \u2013 so no spooky mansions or bats in the belfry! I never felt scared. The kid looked completely normal, I was just a bit confused. I was astounded when my brother, years later, mentioned his friend seeing him; it did send a shiver up my spine.</p> <p>Now when I remember the events, I just find it intriguing and wonder if I dreamt it all but I know I was awake both times and I also know,that my brother\u2019s mates had no prior knowledge of my experiences.</p> <p>I\u2019m not sure what ghosts are but I know they\u2019re real.</p> <h2>\u2018My eyes always water when I tell the story now\u2019</h2> <p>It was 2006, and I was staying over in my friend\u2019s basement flat in Edinburgh. It was quite an old-fashioned, stone building. At around 5am, I woke up and felt like there was something happening in the room. I looked up and saw a little girl staring at me from the end of the sofa. I can\u2019t really remember what she looked like but she was completely still and had her hair tied up in a bun. I obviously got a fright so started to repeat \u201cHello? Hello?\u201d out loud, as in the moment I couldn\u2019t work out if it was real or if I was hallucinating. I then put my head under my blanket for a second, and by this point my friend who was also in the room woke up and worriedly asked me what was happening. <br></p> <p>By the time I looked back up again, the figure was gone. My friend was not convinced as I was still basically asleep so in that half-awake, half-still dreaming state, but I am certain there was something there. When I then told my friend whose house we were in, he got pretty freaked out as I was the second person to have stayed in the living room to mention seeing a little girl. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/28/halloween-confession-believe-ghosts\">Here\u2019s a Halloween confession: I wouldn\u2019t bet on there not being ghosts | Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett</a> </p> </aside>  <p>At the time, I was less scared and just more confused. To wake up and have someone you don\u2019t recognise looking at you is very odd, and to not be able to see properly doesn\u2019t help. When you try to speak to it and get no response, that is when it started to get frightening, and why I ended up hiding under the blanket. The ghost, spirit, energy was only there for a couple seconds and the other person in the room couldn\u2019t see it, so it was a very uncomfortable experience. I knew I had been engaged with this figure for a few seconds, but then it was just inexplicably gone. My eyes always water when I tell the story now, as I just don\u2019t think I will ever know what was happening. </p> <p>I think if people haven\u2019t experienced anything like that, they have this notion of \u2018ghosts\u2019 as being spooky, scary, dangerous but I believe it\u2019s more of an energy that is left over from someone. I think that\u2019s why I\u2019m so sure that it was real, because I must have woken up because of something in the room waking me somehow, just by changing the energy in the room. I know that it was different from a half asleep hallucination and that something was there, and maybe my willingness to understand that is the difference. It might be that people have been through a similar thing but don\u2019t believe that it is an actual spirit. If someone else had seen the same figure as me, I know it must exist there for some reason. It\u2019s really difficult to work out what I feel about ghosts because I am usually not one to believe in things like that but I can\u2019t deny that experience at all.<br></p> <h2>\u2018I don\u2019t expect to be believed whenever I choose to share this story\u2019 \u2013 Tim, Hove</h2> <p>One night in December 2004 I was driving back to Brighton from my workplace near Lindfield in Sussex, a little after 11pm. I worked in a care home, and the hours were unsociable. The journey took me along the B2112 from Wivelsfield through the village of Ditchling, and then a left turn onto Beacon Road before ascending the very steep, winding road known as Ditchling Bostall leading up to Ditchling Beacon, the tallest peak on the Sussex Downs.</p> <p>I passed through the quiet village and, as the streetlights came to an end, flicked on my main beams and shifted into low gear to negotiate the tight bends which snaked their way up the hillside, trees reaching in from either side of the road to meet in the middle. </p> <p>As I made my way around the fourth turn on the ascent, about two-thirds of the way up the incline, my headlamps illuminated the back of a tall male figure, striding up the right hand side of the road and travelling in the same direction as me. High leather boots, a long, dark coat and a wide-brimmed hat were clearly picked out in the Ford Escort\u2019s halogen main beams. My immediate impulse was to avoid hitting the unexpected walker, who I assumed to be a farmer, perhaps making his way home from one of the village pubs. High earthen banks and dense trees lined both sides of the road, and there was nowhere for a pedestrian to move out of the way of traffic.<br><br>It occurred to me that maybe something was wrong, like his car had broken down in the village and he could use a lift up such a punishingly steep hill on such a cold night. I eased off the throttle, coming to a halt halfway between the two bends with my foot on the brake pedal, and lowered the driver\u2019s window. I could clearly see the figure reflected in my door mirror, still striding up the side of the road towards me, and brightly lit by the brake lights. As he drew closer I cleared my throat and prepared to ask him if he needed a lift up the hill and then I noticed one tiny detail: it had no face. <br><br>The hat, the coat, and even a scarf knotted at the throat were plain to see in the bright red brake lights but where the face should have been was nothing but darkness. It wasn\u2019t in shadow from the hat, as the brakes were low down and lit the figure completely. It wasn\u2019t a balaclava or any other face covering, as that would at least have shown an outline. Above the scarf and below the hat, there was simply nothing at all. </p> <p>I tried to rationalise what I\u2019d seen, but I couldn\u2019t come up with anything. I don\u2019t expect to be believed whenever I choose to share this story, and I accept that there is always a high level of ridicule levelled at people who claim they\u2019ve had a brush with something inexplicable.</p> <h2>\u2018I wouldn\u2019t have entertained the idea of supernatural entities until I had experienced it first hand\u2019 \u2013 Matt, Manchester</h2> <p>It was 2005, and I was living in a shared rented house in north Wales. The house itself was an old terraced house that had belonged to an elderly lady before the landlord had purchased it and rented out. </p> <p>A couple of weeks after my partner and I moved in I was convinced I saw something move quickly upstairs. My room was the front room, and I had a desk at one end. My back was to the door, and whenever I sat there I always felt an uncomfortable sense of being watched. </p> <p>We\u2019d see movement or a shape that would, very briefly, seem like a white cat out of the corner of our eyes. Almost all of these were either of the shape running up or down the stairs, or sitting at the top on the landing. Both my partner and I experienced them. This continued for the entire two years we lived there. It was unnerving at first, and the first few times we were convinced a cat had got into the house. After a while, we became accustomed to the occasional sense of \u2018ghost cat\u2019 and it became a bit of a joke with friends when they visited. </p> <p>When we lived at the house there was a freezer unit under the stairs. When we moved it, we realised the carpet was damp. We reported it to the landlord who shared an anecdote that whilst he was renovating the house, he\u2019d found loose stone under the stairs and the skull and bones of a cat buried inside. He didn\u2019t know about \u2018ghost cat\u2019 until we both burst out laughing and told him. </p> <p>I wouldn\u2019t have entertained the idea of supernatural entities until I had experienced it first hand. I\u2019m neither religious nor superstitious and find it particularly difficult to explain the ghostly cat stalking up and down the stairs! I\u2019m still dubious of a lot of the stories, as there\u2019s plenty of money to be made on playing on people\u2019s superstition, but I\u2019m certainly a believer in some kind of supernatural ability. </p> <h2>\u2018There are things we can\u2019t explain and we have to make peace with that\u2019</h2> <p>It was my mother\u2019s 60th birthday and it was the night before a big gathering the following day. Our family - my sisters, their partners and my parents - were all staying the night before the big day. After a lovely evening meal and only a few glasses of wine, we all turned in for a good night\u2019s rest, hoping to be fresh for all the festivities to come. <br><br>I stayed in what used to be my childhood bedroom, which was now the guest room. After settling into a gentle slumber only 45 minutes or so must have passed. At that point I was startled awake by the bedroom door, which had been closed, slamming shut with force and giving me quite a start. My husband was still dead to the world; he\u2019s a heavy sleeper. Now awake, I saw what I could only describe as a faint and translucent figure hovering by my bedside. I couldn\u2019t make out a face or distinct shape, but it was gazing at me. Not maliciously. But it did leave me confused and ill at ease. I felt I knew the presence and couldn\u2019t quite adapt to the reality of what was beside me. The figure moved further up the bed. Incredulous, I reached my hand out to touch the space where it floated. Nothing. But in reaching out, I suddenly felt I knew this was my grandfather who had lived with us in our family home until he passed away from meningitis in his early 60s. </p> <p>Completely freaked out at this point, I turned to face away and instead face towards my husband, clinging for reassurance and he in turn woke up. Nothing was then visible, but my heart was hammering in my chest. I told my family and they believed me entirely. It felt timely and special but creepy all at once. Friends tried to rationalise what had happened for me, it\u2019s not an easy thing to hear from someone who is known for being a pragmatic and slightly cynincal. I am quite an open person with high levels of empathy. This isn\u2019t always a blessing in life but I do think it may have something to do with the visit I received. </p> <p>There are things we can\u2019t explain and we have to make peace with that. As a staunch atheist that\u2019s a tough belief to hold. </p> <h2>\u2018My story creeps people out because ... I\u2019m a level-headed strong character\u2019</h2> <p>I was a junior Detective in the 80\u2019s helping out on a particularly gruesome domestic murder investigation in a major UK city.The body was being forensically examined by a pathologist, with myself and a few others acting as witnesses. The mortuary was an old Victorian Gothic building and during the (cold, evening) procedure I was suddenly aware of someone watching me from the corner of the high-vaulted, tiled room.I glanced into the corner and saw what appeared to be a cloud of flies in a column, such as you might see on a hot day at the bottom of the garden; for a split second it coalesced into the faint, transparent shape of a young woman, who smiled briefly at me, then vanished. We solved the case the next day.</p> <p>All the hairs on the back of my neck stood up. I had done countless such examinations in the past, but I felt her looking at me before I saw her. It\u2019s quite cathartic sharing the story. Nobody else mentioned seeing anything. My story creeps people out. Because it has some veracity: location, circumstances, I\u2019m a level-headed strong character.</p> <p>It gave me cause for question, but I\u2019m still a huge sceptic ... perception is not always reality.</p> <h2>\u2018These experiences I\u2019ve had in my life have shown me just how much we don\u2019t know\u2019 - Ian, Switzerland </h2> <p>My wife of 50 years died in 2009. I was quickly able to find another smaller flat to cover my needs. This flat is about one mile from our old home. This story and two other experiences took place in the three months or so after her death. </p> <p>I was sitting in the living room watching TV. From my chair a good part of the kitchen was visible. I became aware that my wife, full size, was standing in the middle of a man-high glass vitrine standing in the kitchen corner. She was simply watching me. I believe she was in fact simply letting me know she was still around, so to speak. Oddly enough when I looked directly at the vitrine she wasn\u2019t there. I only saw her out of the corner of my eye \u2013 not quite, but I can\u2019t put it a better way.</p> <p>She appeared to be semi-transparent, to say she shimmered wouldn\u2019t be right but she was sort of silvery. She simply watched me. This lasted for about half a minute and then she was gone. There wasn\u2019t anything like fear on my part, after all it was my wife. In fact I was elated that this was taking place, that she had gone to the trouble to show herself to me and that she knew where I now lived! </p> <p>It was a gladdening experience and I did for a while hope that it would repeat itself, but it didn\u2019t. It was sufficient. </p> <p>It only confirmed once again that these experiences I\u2019ve had in my life have shown me just how much we don\u2019t know. </p> <p><strong>If you have a ghost story to share, please do so in the comments below.

This implication is not confined to one instance, but rather is increasingly how Britain responds to any group in need: from foreign children begging for refuge to disabled people struggling without benefits.</p> <p>It showed itself back when the Conservatives <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/9263502/Iain-Duncan-Smith-Im-not-scared-to-light-the-fuse-on-disability-reform.html\">began to roll out sweeping disability cuts</a> in 2012 as government ministers and the rightwing press combined faux concern for the \u201cvulnerable\u201d with the claim the welfare bill was riddled with fraud and abuse.

But when suspicion is the default setting, the goalposts are ever shifting. A teenager can meet the requirements necessary to be approved for refugee status by the British authorities, but one look at a photo and the Sun can declare he\u2019s \u201c35 if he\u2019s a day\u201d.

On the contrary, it\u2019s all been done to ensure support goes to those who truly need it.</p> <p>In reality, this line of thinking not only suggests that the people who are not genuine \u2013 say, 19-year-old refugees \u2013 don\u2019t deserve help, it also creates a excuse to not help anyone at all. \u201cI\u2019d support a benefit system for real disabled people but all the scroungers make it impossible,\u201d goes the argument. Or \u201cI\u2019d obviously help a refugee child, but how can we if we can\u2019t tell who\u2019s actually a child?\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/oct/29/kindertransport-heros-daughter-urges-uk-to-welcome-calais-refugees\">Kindertransport hero\u2019s daughter urges UK to welcome Calais refugees</a> </p> </aside>  <p>What it is doing fundamentally is setting us against each other, introducing a poisonous paranoia into daily discourse that says we should look with suspicion at anyone who asks for help.

  "<p>When Colin George announced in 1967 that the new theatre planned for Sheffield would have a thrust stage with the audience on three sides, one city councillor said he was not \u201cgoing to pay to see Hamlet\u2019s backside\u201d and Sir Bernard Miles, then running the Mermaid in London, but with a background in Sheffield rep, said: \u201cIt will be blacklisted by all reputable dramatists.\u201d</p> <p>Ten years later, however, the city was famous as the home of world championship snooker \u2013 broadcast from the <a href=\"https://www.sheffieldtheatres.co.uk/news/paying-tribute-to-colin-george-founding-artistic-director-of-the-crucible-theatre\">Crucible</a>. The theatre was also doubling its audience and winning awards.</p> <p>George, who has died aged 87, was one of the postwar generation of British directors who moved theatre on from fortnightly rep in \u201cthe provinces\u201d to more adventurous productions that could compete with television drama and the West End stage. A quietly spiritual man \u2013 he became a Quaker \u2013 he was also a theatre visionary, founding the Crucible\u2019s education and community company, Theatre Vanguard. It made Sheffield only the second rep in the UK to produce work for schools and young people.</p> <p>George was born in Pembroke Dock, south-west Wales, the son of Edward George, a Congregational minister, and his wife, Helen (nee Sandercock). He attended Caterham school in Surrey, and after national service studied English at University College, Oxford, where he was heavily involved with the Oxford University Dramatic Society. On graduating, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2005/feb/12/rsc.theatre\">Peter Hall</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2006/feb/07/theatre.rsc\">John Barton</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/apr/30/paul-almond\">Paul Almond</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2012/jul/08/toby-robertson\">Toby Robertson</a> in 1952 he formed the Oxford and Cambridge Players, which became the Elizabethan Theatre Company.

There, in 1964, he directed Alastair Sim as Shylock and Gemma Jones as Portia, and the theatre\u2019s artistic director, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2011/nov/21/john-neville\">John Neville</a>, in Sophocles\u2019s Oedipus the King. Steeped in the classics, he would direct Oedipus again in a memorable Sheffield production using masks; a \u201cfascist\u201d Macbeth followed in 1970 with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2001/dec/26/guardianobituaries.filmnews\">Nigel Hawthorne</a> establishing himself as much more than a light comedian.</p> <p>George took over from Geoffrey Ost as artistic director of Sheffield Playhouse in 1965, and introduced the city\u2019s audiences to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2008/dec/27/harold-pinter-obituary-playwright-politics\">Harold Pinter</a>, Bertholt Brecht, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/dec/24/john-osborne-a-natural-dissenter-who-changed-the-face-of-british-theatre\">John Osborne</a> and John Arden. While these writers did not fill the 560-seater converted temperance hall, the play about the <a href=\"https://www.tuc.org.uk/about-tuc/union-history/section-events-led-first-tuc\">\u201cSheffield outrages\u201d</a> \u2013 murderous attacks on exploitative non-union employers a century before that led to the first trade union regulation \u2013 which he commissioned from the actor Alan Cullen most certainly did. Called <a href=\"http://www.suds.shef.ac.uk/production/stirrings/stirrings.html\">The Stirrings in Sheffield on Saturday Night</a>, and with music by Rod Horn using traditional material, the play entered the city\u2019s bloodstream and there are hundreds of Sheffielders today who can still make a fair stab at To Be a Sheffield Grinder, the show\u2019s hit song. The production featured Dorothy Vernon, a former Sheffield teacher turned actor, whom George married in 1967.</p> <p>In 1966, much to his astonishment, the city\u2019s Labour council asked George where he wanted his new theatre. The Playhouse was to be demolished to make way for a ring road. A site was found, within a stone\u2019s throw of the old Edwardian Lyceum theatre. A proscenium arch with a large forestage was planned for the new building. But in October 1967 the director Tyrone Guthrie visited Sheffield to give a talk. Something of a maverick, he had discovered the \u201cthrust\u201d configuration in Edinburgh when, working with Laurence Olivier, a production had to be moved into a hall with seats arranged on three sides.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3a5d31efde96d85eabc89218f549a3bd61831deb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3a5d31efde96d85eabc89218f549a3bd61831deb/51_108_2373_1424/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Colin George in rehearsal.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Colin George in rehearsal.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Crucible Theatre</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He persuaded George to visit the US and Canada and look at the thrust stages in Stratford, Ontario, and Minneapolis. Henry V, and the prologue\u2019s speech asking the actor to \u201cascend the brightest heaven of invention\u201d came into George\u2019s head as he walked up the tunnel to the stage of the <a href=\"https://www.guthrietheater.org\">Guthrie Theater</a> in Minneapolis. It was a road-to-Damascus moment.</p> <p>The 1,000-seater Crucible opened in November 1971 with Fanfare, a compilation show featuring Ian McKellen and Edward Petherbridge in Chekhov, a brass band and Sheffield children singing Consider Yourself from Oliver!. All well and good but not yet the real thing.Guthrie died before he could direct the first play, Aeschylus\u2019s Agamemnon. George staged Peer Gynt instead, but the energy needed to get the theatre built had taken its toll. With many theatregoers already sceptical about the thrust stage,<strong> </strong>this was not the moment for a somewhat underpowered Ibsen and an even less well-known play, in Thomas Dekker\u2019s The Shoemaker\u2019s Holiday.</p> <p>But when he revived Stirrings in 1973 things looked up. He left Sheffield on a high a year later with Calamity Jane, featuring Lynda Marchal \u2013 now better known as the writer Lynda la Plante \u2013 as a wonderfully feisty and funny lead.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/jan/17/colin-george-obituary-letter\">Letter: Colin George, Tyrone Guthrie and the thrust stage in Britain</a> </p> </aside>  <p>George worked in turn at the <a href=\"http://www.statetheatrecompany.com.au\">State Theatre Company of South Australia</a> and then the <a href=\"https://www.hkapa.edu\">Hong Kong Academy for Performing Arts</a>, where he was dean for 11 years.

  "<p>For Rolls-Royce, the stakes are high. </p> <p>One of Britain\u2019s most celebrated companies is facing potential prosecution over allegations it spent years hiring middlemen who paid bribes all around the world. </p> <p>For the company, prosecution could mean tremendous reputational damage.

Corruption is part and parcel of doing business in many of the countries in which Rolls-Royce operates, and with so much riding on each and every contract firms can come under enormous pressure to secure an advantage.</p> <p>At the heart of the allegations against Rolls-Royce is the suggestion that the company may have secured multimillion-dollar contracts in foreign jurisdictions by using agents who paid bribes.<br></p> <p>Rolls-Royce acknowledges it hired agents \u2013 otherwise known as commercial advisers, intermediaries or middlemen \u2013 to help sell its products. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/31/the-12-countries-where-suspicious-activity-linked-to-rolls-royce-has-been-identified\">The 12 countries where suspicious activity linked to Rolls-Royce has been identified</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It is not illegal to hire them. These agents often market themselves to multinationals as an essential part of doing business, purporting to have exclusive access to key decision-makers or unique insights into how a bid for a contract should be structured. However, middlemen can also provide a convenient channel by which illicit cash can change hands at arm\u2019s-length.</p> <p>Rolls-Royce has declined to comment in detail on the corruption allegations since they first emerged four years ago. In its annual report in 2014, the multinational revealed that it had \u201c<a href=\"http://www.rolls-royce.com/~/media/Files/R/Rolls-Royce/documents/investors/annual-reports/2014-annual-report-v2.pdf\">dramatically</a>\u201d cut the number of intermediaries through which it did business around the world, a tacit acceptance that such practices were either unnecessary or inappropriate.</p> <p>As the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/serious-fraud-office\">Serious Fraud Office</a> inquiry into Rolls-Royce is about to enter its fifth year, dozens of investigators continue to examine the evidence against the company. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theage.com.au/interactive/2016/the-bribe-factory/day-1/the-company-that-bribed-the-world.html\">A fresh leak of documents from a firm of agents, Unaoil</a>, to investigative journalists at Australia\u2019s Fairfax Media only adds to the complexity. Unaoil represented Rolls-Royce in at least five countries, according to those documents. As such, any decision about whether or not to prosecute Rolls-Royce and its staff or executives is unlikely to be made before 2017, according to sources familiar with the investigation.</p> <p>Sue Hawley, policy director at the monitoring group <a href=\"http://www.cw-uk.org/\">Corruption Watch</a>, said: \u201cThis decision will be a key test of the UK\u2019s ability, and willingness, to bring large and politically sensitive companies to book. If Rolls-Royce are found to have engaged in wrongdoing, they must also be barred from public procurement contracts for an appropriate length of time.\u201d</p> <p>The British government decisively failed the last such test.

His lawyers told the Guardian: \u201cSudhir Choudhrie was investigated but was never arrested. He was subsequently cleared of all allegations of wrongdoing and the investigation as a whole was closed in 2011.\u201d</p> <p>In a closure report filed in a Delhi court that year, the CBI stated it did not find any evidence to suggest there was any payoff to Choudhrie or his companies. </p> <p>A list compiled and disseminated by the CBI names Sudhir Choudhrie as one of 23 \u201cunscrupulous persons\u201d on a list of \u201cundesirable contact men\u201d.

Is there a benign explanation? Could the banking source in Geneva have got it wrong? Lawyers for Bhanu Choudhrie insist he has. \u201cOur client has no knowledge of what bank accounts have been set up or operated by Mr Ginger or what sums (if any) he has deposited in them in cash. Mr Choudhrie did not pay any bribe to Mr Ginger.\u201d</p> <p>They added: \u201cOur client has no knowledge of any payments made [by the Foundation].\u201d</p> <p>The Guardian asked Ginger why he visited Geneva with Bhanu Choudhrie, and why the Panamanian foundation was funding his relative\u2019s education. He declined to comment on the allegations: \u201cI am not prepared to talk about it at all. I\u2019m not going to respond to the media at all.\u201d</p> <p>BAE Systems said it had \u201cno record indicating that Mr Ginger had a personal financial relationship with Mr Choudhrie during the period that Mr Ginger was employed by the Company\u201d.</p> <p>The episode may be nothing more than an intriguing vignette, but the SFO may have an opportunity to judge for itself. The source, who asked not to be named, has offered to speak to the SFO\u2019s investigators.</p> <p>The Choudhries had to wait seven years to be cleared after Indian authorities launched an inquiry \u2013 the SFO has been looking at them, and at Rolls-Royce, for a mere three.

  "<p>FBI director James Comey <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/29/fury-fbi-director-cryptic-letter-clinton-emails-response\">set off a torrent of criticism</a> late last week when he directly inserted himself into the presidential campaign with a vague letter to Congress about the reopening of Clinton email case. His conduct has shocked many observers across the political spectrum, but the only thing truly surprising about this episode is that people are only now realizing how power-hungry and dangerous Comey actually is.</p> <p>During his stints in the Bush and Obama administration Comey has continually taken authoritarian and factually dubious public stances both at odds with responsible public policy and sometimes the law. The Clinton case is not an aberration, it\u2019s part of a clear pattern.</p> <p>Liberals <a href=\"http://media.abcnews.com/Politics/OTUS/democrats-love-james-comey-obamas-republican-pick-lead/story?id=19289113\">were once enthralled</a> when Obama appointed the Republican as FBI chief in 2013. They talked about Comey as if he was above reproach because of his role as acting attorney general under George W Bush, when he <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/05/15/AR2007051500864.html\">threatened to resign</a> over an aspect of the president\u2019s illegal warrantless wiretapping program.</p> <p>As Glenn Greenwald <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/may/30/james-comey-fbi-bush-nsa\">explained at the time of</a> Comey\u2019s confirmation in 2013, this story is incredibly misleading. Yes, Comey did curtail a small part of the NSA\u2019s sprawling surveillance program in 2004, however, that occurred before the public ever knew of the existence of any NSA domestic program. The version of illegal warrantless wiretapping that the New York Times revealed in 2005, which sparked a firestorm of liberal criticism and widespread accusations of illegal conduct, was the program that Comey was totally fine with and signed off on.</p> <p>Why he is celebrated as anything close to the hero is baffling. During the Bush administration, Comey also aggressively <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/archive/dag/speeches/2004/dag6104.htm\">defended the arrest</a> and due process-free imprisonment of a US citizen, Jose Padilla, on US soil. He was held as an \u201cenemy combatant\u201d, tortured, and refused a lawyer for three and half years \u2013 to this day, one of the most egregious violations of the constitution by the Bush administration. In addition, Comey also <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/07/us/politics/07lawyers.html?hp\">gave his legal sign-off on torture techniques</a> during the Bush administration, despite harboring personal doubts.</p> <p>Since taking over at the FBI, speaking up without all \u2013 or any \u2013 of the facts has become a Comey specialty. He <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/mar/01/congress-showed-willing-fight-fbi-encryption-finally\">has led a high-profile</a> two-year fight to essentially outlaw end-to-end encryption, a vital tool that protects citizens\u2019 privacy and security. He has done so freely admitting he doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s talking about, while his demands fly in the face of the opinions of many prominent computer scientists, who <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/08/technology/code-specialists-oppose-us-and-british-government-access-to-encrypted-communication.html\">have argued mandating backdoors</a> in encryption is impossible to do safely and a recipe for disaster.</p> <p>After having failed to convince the public \u2013 despite claiming it was vital the public debate the issue \u2013 he then <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/news/2016/03/15/apple-v-fbi-timeline/81827400/\">went to a judge to try</a> to force Apple to backdoor its own iPhone encryption <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/a-dangerous-all-writ-precedent-in-the-apple-case\">using a law written</a> in the 1700s. As Riley Roberts, previously a speechwriter for former attorney general Eric Holder, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/09/james-comey-fbi-accountability-214234\">wrote in Politico in September</a>, \u201cComey steamrolled his White House and Pentagon colleagues \u2013 even scuttling an administration-wide encryption policy that was under development \u2013 by insisting that Apple be forced to unlock the phone for the government.\u201d</p> <p>Then last year, wholly without evidence, Comey <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/24/us/politics/fbi-chief-links-scrutiny-of-police-with-rise-in-violent-crime.html\">promoted the discredited \u201cFerguson Effect</a>\u201d, arguing that crime has increased because police were afraid to do their jobs now that there is a slightly higher chance that citizens might film them shooting an unarmed person. Not only do studies show this theory is false (and separately, that crime has not markedly increased), it\u2019s an insult to police officers. \u201cHe ought to stick to what he knows,\u201d James O Pasco Jr, executive director of the National Fraternal Order of Police, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/12/us/comey-ferguson-effect-police-videos-fbi.html\">told the New York Times</a>, referring to Comey. \u201cHe\u2019s basically saying that police officers are afraid to do their jobs with absolutely no proof.\u201d</p> <p>Similarly, as President Obama and many politicians in both parties <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/28/us/politics/obama-sentencing-laws.html\">have called for a reduction</a> in harsh mandatory minimum prison sentences that have made the US by far the largest jailer in the world, Comey publicly spoke out against any such criminal justice reform. \u201cI know from my experience \u2026 that the mandatory minimums are an important tool in developing cooperators,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/09/james-comey-fbi-accountability-214234\">he said</a>. Again, evidence shows the opposite, mandatory minimums have <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/report-says-long-sentences-dont-deter-crime-2014-5\">never been shown</a> to make anyone safer or increase \u201ccooperation\u201d (a euphemism for threatening defendants with decades in jail so they forgo their constitutional right to jury trial and take a plea deal). But facts have never gotten in the way of Comey and his beliefs.</p> <p>Neither does the law, when it suits him. In 2008, the FBI was told by the Bush justice department (after Comey left) that it needed a warrant to gather email records and web browsing about Americans. But under Comey\u2019s FBI, the agency <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://theintercept.com/2016/06/02/fbi-kept-demanding-email-records-despite-doj-saying-it-needed-a-warrant/\">has continued to disregard</a> the justice department\u2019s legal opinion, and to this day, demands tech companies hand it all sorts of data under due-process free National Security Letters.</p> <p>Just two months ago, Riley <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/09/james-comey-fbi-accountability-214234\">wrote</a> in Politico, \u201cthere is a growing consensus that Comey has wielded the powers of the directorship more aggressively than anyone since Hoover \u2013 to the consternation, and even anger, of some of his colleagues.\u201d</p> <p>The evidence against Comey has been available ever since President Obama nominated him. All that\u2019s changed is that people are finally paying attention.</p>",
  "<p>Mark Carney is unequivocally not responsible for the slowing of the UK economy or the fall in the pound. Quite the contrary, he almost single-handedly turned around a potential collapse in output and sentiment in the days after the EU referendum on 23 June. Far from harming Britain, Carney has been the country\u2019s saviour.</p> <p>I have criticised the Bank of England governor rather harshly in the past, especially for his claim in August 2015, that \u201c<a href=\"http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Pages/speeches/2015/837.aspx\">sustained momentum</a>\u201d in the UK economy and rising inflation would \u201clikely put the decision as to when to start the process of gradual monetary policy normalisation into <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jan/20/bank-of-england-missing-financial-crisis-interest-rates\">sharper relief</a> around the turn of this year\u201d.</p> <p>That didn\u2019t happen. But I have changed my mind. Right now we all need to stand behind Carney for the good of the country. Without him, chaos reigns.</p> <p>It was entirely appropriate for the prime minister to back Carney even though she undermined his position in her speech to the Conservative conference earlier this month. The mistake was waiting so long to do so. The \u201cMayhem\u201d government must now do everything possible to keep him in place, for his full eight-year term. The UK has already been relegated from fifth to sixth largest economy in the world, moving behind France, as a result of the Brexit vote, and its credit rating has been downgraded.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In the space of a few days, non-economists William Hague and Michael Gove have attacked central bank independence</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I find it astonishing that in the space of a few days, non-economists William Hague and Michael Gove have written newspaper columns attacking central bank independence, while Daniel Hannan, a former journalist and a Eurosceptic Tory MEP, appeared on the BBC <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-37820627\">denouncing Carney</a> in similar terms, in an apparently coordinated campaign.</p> <p>There were utterly idiotic suggestions that Jacob Rees-Mogg, a Tory MP who knows no economics and has a degree in history, should replace Carney.

Liam Fox, a medical doctor with no training in economics, astonishingly ordered Chancellor Philip Hammond not to start \u201c<a href=\"http://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/726943/Liam-Fox-Philip-Hammond-Brexit-fallout-government-autumn-statement-project-fear?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+daily-express-uk-news+%28Daily+Express+%3A%3A+UK+Feed%29\">Project Fear Two</a>\u201d in the latest Brexit spat. Fox apparently urged Hammond not to inject fiscal stimulus as it may cause Britons to \u201cwrongly\u201d panic about the impact Brexit might have on the economy. As the Bible advises: \u201cStay away from a fool, for you will not find knowledge on their lips\u201d (Proverbs 14:7).</p> <p>The Oxford economist Simon Wren-Lewis has argued, rightly, that there seems to be a \u201clarge element of shooting the messenger in the attacks on Carney. He warned of the short-term difficulties Brexit might create, and helped take decisive action to avoid those dangers. But to the Brexiteers, it is an article of faith that Brexit can only bring good, so in their make-believe world, Carney is responsible for talking down the economy.\u201d He isn\u2019t.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/31/theresa-may-support-mark-carney-full-term-bank-of-england-governor\">May backs Carney to serve full term as Bank of England governor</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But the this isn\u2019t just a spat about who said what after the Brexit vote. Threatening central bank independence raises the UK\u2019s risk premium, which is the return in excess of the risk-free rate of return an investment is expected to yield. An asset\u2019s risk premium is a form of compensation for investors who tolerate the extra risk, compared with that of a risk-free asset, in a given investment. We know that UK borrowing costs fell when the Bank of England was made independent in 1997, replacing the Ken and Eddie show. Ex-Bank of England economist and Birmingham University professor Tony Yates told me: \u201cIf Carney were to go, markets would presume we are like tinpot economies where the central bank governor, regardless of the formal framework in place, is assumed to be politically pliant.\u201d That would be very costly.</p> <p>Apple has already announced <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2016/10/28/ftse-100-slides-and-pound-stuck-below-122-as-uk-consumers-fear-p/\">price rises of 20%</a> for its computers as a result of the sterling devaluation. Inflation is set to rise and living standards will start falling again after a couple of years of real wage growth. Real wages are still 7% below their pre-recession peak. The concern, as my old friend ex-MPC member Adam Posen made clear this week, is that the will UK enter a new period of stagflation, of low growth and high inflation caused by Brexit.</p> <p>It is early days, but negotiations on Britain\u2019s future relationship with the EU already seem to be going badly. The EU side holds all the bargaining chips, not least because 27 other governments, plus the national parliaments \u2013 including the Walloon government who objected to the EU trade deal with Canada \u2013 will have to agree to any deal. This may be as good as it gets for a while. But three cheers for Carney.</p>",
  "<p>As if the Revierderby wasn\u2019t claustrophobic enough, Saturday night at the Signal Iduna Park only served to squash the warring neighbours closer together. Nothing at all could separate Borussia Dortmund and Schalke 04 after 90 draining, goalless minutes, and in the table, too, the Royal Blues (12th and rising) and the Black and Yellows (sixth and falling) were firmly put on a mid-table collision close, having spent the opening weeks of the season at opposite ends, a million miles from each other.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/30/tim-wiese-ive-got-trash-talking-in-my-blood-wwe\">Tim Wiese goes from Bundesliga to WWE: \u2018I\u2019ve got trash-talking in my blood\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The new-found proximity left one side much happier than the other. \u201cI leave with a point and a good mood,\u201d said the S04 captain, Benedikt H\u00f6wedes.

With a bit of luck, the visitors could have capitalised on Borussia\u2019s dozy first-half performance; a third minute move involving concerted gegenpressing, a chipped (!)

The slight sense of impatience that permeates the club hints at a potentially bigger problem for him, however. Tuchel, a disciple of Pep Guardiola, is coming up against a resistance that the Spaniard described as \u201ccounter-cultural\u201d during his time in Germany, namely the idea that football should be all-action, all the time, providing non-stop entertainment. That\u2019s how they like it in Dortmund, in particular.</p> <p>Tuchel\u2019s ultimate aim is almost the opposite though: total control over the opposition.

Maybe they never fully will.</p> <h2>Results and talking points</h2> <p>\u2022 After the first half of the first of the season, the Bundesliga has rarely been more Bundesliga-esque. Yes, Bayern are the inevitable leaders, even with their hands in their pockets and Ancelotti treating the league as a amuse-bouche in between Champions League feasts. The second 3-1 win over Augsburg in the space of three days was so comfortable that Arjen Robben and Robert Lewandowski had a chance to strike up a most unlikely football bromance, providing and scoring all three goals between them. \u201cWe\u2019re going for dinner tonight,\u201d said Robben with a naughty glint in his eye. \u201cMaybe we\u2019ll spend the night, too.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 But just below the champions, newly-promoted RB Leipzig \u2013 whose sponsors (and in no-way-actual-owners) are also purveyors of the finest football columns by yours truly \u2013 are a close second, refusing to let up. A patient 2-0 win at anti-possessionistas Darmstadt made it nine games unbeaten for Ralph Hasenh\u00fcttl\u2019s men. S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung felt reminded of TSG Hoffenheim\u2019s stunning first half of the season in 2008-09 under Ralf Rangnick (today RB\u2019s sporting director), both in terms of Leipzig\u2019s playing-style as well as the wall of rejection and animosity that they continue to meet.</p> <p>\u2022 The original public enemies No1 meanwhile, are, too, yo-bum-rushing-the-show under Julian N\u00e4gelsmann, much to the horror of the traditionalists.

  "<p>Terrorists wanted to get firearms to launch gun attacks on Britain\u2019s streets in five extremist plots foiled in the last two years, police have revealed, as they admitted that 800 legally owned guns had gone missing.</p> <p>In a rare joint appeal, the National Crime Agency and Scotland Yard\u2019s counter-terrorism command urged the public to report fears about lax gun security among legal owners as well as criminals handling firearms.</p> <p>The intensified activity comes as British law enforcement, security and intelligence services try to prevent a marauding terrorist gun attack, such as the one that struck Paris in November 2015, happening in the UK.</p> <p>They fear terrorists getting guns from criminals and are concerned by an apparent upsurge in guns on the streets in London and some other big urban areas. </p> <p>Assistant commissioner Mark Rowley, who is in charge of counter-terrorism for the police, said: \u201cWe know that firearms can enter the criminal market through a variety of means, including thefts from legitimate holders or dealers. Law enforcement, together with security and intelligence services, are working tirelessly to locate these weapons, confront the terrorist threat and keep the public safe.\u201d</p> <p>Rowley said that out of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/oct/28/britain-foiled-terror-attacks-plots-police-counter-terrorism-security-services\">10 plots disrupted in the last two years</a>, half had involved jihadis wanting to get guns. Britain\u2019s tight gun laws and the fact the country is an island mean availability of guns is relatively low. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Rowley said terrorists were most likely to get the guns from criminals in communities they know. The main case that is publicly known is that of a group of west London youths arrested as they planned the most significant jihadi plot targeting Britain in a decade.</p> <p>Police, soldiers and civilians were the intended targets of the conspiracy, and the would-be terrorists acquired a gun, silencer and ammunition from a London-based criminal.</p> <p>Ringleader Tarik Hassane, 22, and his friend Suhaib Majeed, 22, were convicted of terrorism offences in March. Two other men, Nyall Hamlett and Nathan Cuffy, were convicted of firearms offences for sourcing and supplying the weapon. Hassane is suspected of associating with Mohammed Emwazi, who gained worldwide notoriety as Isis\u2019s \u201cJihadi John\u201d. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Since then there has been an increase in gun crime, with the Met in July and August recording 202 firearms discharges in London, compared with 87 in the same months last year.</p> <p>Weapons are believed to be coming from eastern Europe by a variety of methods, and national and regional law enforcement officers believe there are increasing numbers of guns on Britain\u2019s streets.</p> <p>Law enforcement officers seized at least 884 firearms last year including Czech-made Skorpion submachine pistols, Uzis, and Mac-10 weapons.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>The NCA director general, Lynne Owens, said<strong tabindex=\"-1\">: </strong>\u201cCurrently we believe we hold an advantage. There is low availability of illegal firearms in the UK compared with European and international partners, but it is not an advantage that we take for granted, and to maintain that advantage we must not stand still. </p> <p><strong>\u201c</strong>Suppressing the availability of illegal firearms in the UK has never been a more significant priority for the law enforcement community. Criminal networks, who think nothing about who they sell firearms to, present a significant route by which extremist groups will try to access the sort of weapons used in recent attacks in Europe.\u201d</p> <p>Rowley is expected to be one of the candidates to apply to be the next commissioner of the Met, to replace Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe.</p> <p>Rowley is national head of counter-terrorism and an assistant commissioner for the Met. Prior to that he was chief constable in Surrey, as was Owens after him.

  "<h2>1 | Think of environment and development as one sector</h2> <p>Sectoral thinking is partly what will hinder us from meeting the sustainable development goals. The question is not how these sectors can collaborate, but how they can become increasingly intertwined to reflect the joined-up nature of the goals. A good example is the transformation from marine governance to ecosystem governance that took place in some countries when fisheries and environment ministries were reformed. <em>Tim Daw, researcher \u2013 ecosystem services and poverty, <a href=\"http://www.stockholmresilience.org/\">Stockholm Resilience Centre</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sthlmresilience\">@sthlmresilience</a></em></p> <h2>2 | Develop trust</h2> <p>Traditionally, we have often seen these two sectors as competing \u2013 with the notion that you had to sacrifice environmental quality for development. There has also been some scepticism from those within these two communities about the intentions or approaches of others. Economists have not always been welcomed in environmental circles and there is mistrust when it comes to issues that are important to so many. But we are seeing a more enlightened view. Both sides are working together and appreciating that by doing this we can achieve more than we could by working against each other. <em>Oren Ahoobim, associate partner, <a href=\"http://www.dalberg.com/\">Dalberg</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/orenahoobim\">@orenahoobim</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DalbergTweet\">@DalbergTweet</a></em></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/may/15/the-planets-health-is-essential-to-prevent-infectious-disease\">The planet's health is essential to prevent infectious disease</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>3 | Use the SDGs as a checklist</h2> <p>We all recognise that we need a holistic approach, so perhaps industrial projects (eg dams and mining) could use the SDGs as a design checklist to ensure they do not cause negative impacts elsewhere and are a positive force for good. We use our <a href=\"http://www.bioregional.com/oneplanetliving/\">One Planet Living</a> framework in this way, which could really work for the SDGs. <em>Sue Riddlestone, CEO and co-founder, <a href=\"http://www.bioregional.com/\">Bioregional</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SueRiddlestone\">@sueriddlestone</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Bioregional\">@bioregional</a></em></p> <h2>4 | Create financial incentives</h2> <p>There are now 20 million artisanal and small-scale miners worldwide. They are responsible for about a tenth of all gold production, but they also do great environmental damage, accounting for the biggest single use of mercury that poisons land and drinking water supplies. The activity is hard to control as miners are widely dispersed, often operating illegally and in remote places. Last week, the GEF council approved a programme that will design and deploy ways in which miners in eight countries can get loans to switch from mercury. <em>Robert Bisset, head of communications, <a href=\"http://thegef.org/\">Global Environment Facility</a>,<a href=\"https://twitter.com/RobbieBisset\"> @robbiebisset</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/theGEF\">@theGEF</a></em></p> <h2>5 | Support social entrepreneurs</h2> <p>We need business models where development aid and environmental grants are used to get things started, and then they need to stand on their own two feet as some sort of service or business. Social entrepreneurs are entering the development space with initiatives like this, for example, projects bringing solar power to villages in remote areas help development and address environmental issues. <em>Sue Riddleston</em>e</p> <h2>6 | Educate children about sustainability</h2> <p>We need all children and students to know not to support unsustainable solutions, so that when they grow up \u2013 perhaps to be engineers or designers \u2013 they will discourage solutions that are unsustainable.

A factory or mine may be designed to minimise environmental harm but unless someone is there to monitor emissions, standards might slip. This process of safeguarding and achieving the best development outcomes is set out in various documents (such as the African Development Bank\u2019s Safeguard Policy). The key is to ensure they are implemented during and after construction as, unfortunately, when these major projects are operational, development practitioners have little or no influence. There is a key role for environmental NGOs here. <em>Mike Webster, director, <a href=\"http://www.wasteaid.org.uk/\">WasteAid UK</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/michaelgwebster\">@michaelgwebster</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/WasteAidUK\">@WasteAidUK</a></em></p> <h2>8 | Host cross-sectoral events</h2> <p>I got to know some development NGOs at the UN general assembly and during the SDG process, but now the goals are being implementing, where do we meet up? Maybe the environment and development sectors need to have opportunities to get together more often. <em>Sue Riddlestone</em></p> <h2>9 | Harness natural resources</h2> <p>Virunga National Park authorities have acknowledged that the four million people who live outside the park will not stop entering it to cut down trees (for charcoal), hunt wildlife and graze cattle. The Virunga Alliance has helped install three hydroelectric dams that generate electricity for villages outside the park. Children can now study and women can walk with greater safety at night, and businesses are arriving in the region. The project has begun to promote better relations between the park\u2019s rangers and the local people, while building peace, stability and hope in North Kivu province. By harnessing the natural power of the park, the authorities have made great inroads to protecting its exceptionally rich biodiversity. <em><a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/10307636\">Alex Jones</a></em></p> <h2>10 | Promote context-specific technology </h2> <p>In the Maasai village where I live, we now have solar energy installed for lights and charging points, and a solar water pump means children have time to do homework and women can take literacy classes. We have switched to clean cook stoves, using cow dung as fuel, and are about to install proper waste treatment because the wind blows in plastics from across the Mara. We have done this at a village scale, which is now being repeated across the Maasai, while keeping all the cultural elements of pastoralism and a semi-nomadic life. The Maasai may live in a world of no money and little food, but it is a world where the best technology can help ensure the future of an important indigenous people. <em>Jacqueline McGlade, chief scientist, UN environment programme, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/UNEP\">@UNEP</a></em> </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2015/jul/01/benin-forest-food-security-nutrition\">Discovering the secrets of Benin\u2019s forests to improve nutrition</a> </p> </aside>  <h2><strong>11 | Tie funding to joint development and environmental outcomes</strong></h2> <p>The environment and development sectors will need to build on the objectives of each other to attract critical funding. This will require them to rethink and expand their work, but will present the opportunity to leverage each other in developing a larger value proposition. We are working with The Nature Conservancy to develop an insurance product to protect reefs facing the damaging impacts of storms. While the traditional approach to reef protection has been to seek public or donor funding to support biodiversity, there is a big opportunity to increase funding to this critical natural infrastructure by layering in development objectives. The reefs provide crucial protection and tourism for the communities and businesses behind them. <em>Adam Connaker, program associate \u2013 innovative finance, <a href=\"http://www.rockefellerfoundation.org/\">The Rockefeller Foundation</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RockefellerFdn\">@RockefellerFdn</a></em></p> <h2>12 | Promote the links between environment and sustainable development</h2> <p>Early on, development was focused solely on economic growth, which was often achieved by extracting natural capital. Now there is growing recognition that nature serves as the foundation for development over the long term because natural systems support our food production, clean our water, regulate our climate, and safeguard the Earth\u2019s biodiversity.

  "<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2013/aug/23/brenda-blethyn-vera-family-values\">Brenda Blethyn</a> says she welled up as she voiced the part of Ethel in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/oct/27/ethel-ernest-review-moving-adaptation-of-raymond-briggss-graphic-novel\">the new animated film version</a> of Ethel &amp; Ernest, Raymond Briggs\u2019s graphic novel about his parents, a bestseller when it was published almost 20 years ago. There were, she says, striking parallels with her own family, and it took her back to life in postwar Kent.</p> <p>Blethyn was the youngest of nine, and her mum and dad were well into middle age when she was born in 1946. Like Ethel and Ernest, they lived through two world wars, the depression, the cold war, and survived to witness the cultural revolution of the 1960s. They were part of what Briggs sees as a generation of giants, often unsung, which was why he wrote his homage.</p> <p>\u201cMy dad was born in 1894,\u201d says Blethyn. \u201cMy mum was 10 years younger and, like Ethel, was a ladies\u2019 maid. They would tell us stories about the war and the hardship of the depression, so it was all very familiar to me.\u201d When her parents met, her mother was a scullery maid and her father a chauffeur.

Blethyn grew up in Ramsgate and, although her family was very poor, she says: \u201cWe didn\u2019t feel deprived. It\u2019s only when you look back and see what we have now that you think, \u2018Lord, how on earth did my mother manage with all of us, with one tap in the house, one sink?\u2019 I said to her once, \u2018Are we poor?\u2019 She said, \u2018No, we just don\u2019t have any money.\u2019 Blethyn laughs at the memory. \u201cIt was difficult. There were tough times. But we got tons of affection. You might be reprimanded severely for something, but there was laughter, cuddles, pride and support in equal measure.\u201d</p> <p>I wonder what her numerous siblings have done with their lives, thinking that perhaps Blethyn will be the odd one out in achieving so much: a 40-year career, acclaimed performances on stage and screen, Oscar nominations for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/News_Story/Critic_Review/Guardian_review/0,4267,544579,00.html\">Secrets and Lies</a> and Little Voice. But she reels off a string of high-powered jobs: professor of civil engineering, sales executive, music teacher, chef, navigator, quantity surveyor. The pride and support in the Bottle household clearly paid off.<br></p> <p>Those multiple successes may explain why she dislikes her career being presented as a rags-to-riches story. \u201cFrom humble beginnings to Hollywood star,\u201d she once said derisively. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem that extraordinary to me.\u201d It wasn\u2019t a Cinderella-style transformation, but the result of desire, talent and hard work. \u201cMy dad always said you have to try.

A lot of the time, we didn\u2019t have a wireless either, because the bill hadn\u2019t been paid. But they were terrific storytellers. Dad would get up and act out a story, while mum would be sherracking him.\u201d Sherracking \u2013 a lovely vernacular word that, says Blethyn, means \u201ccalling names, making fun, hollering out\u201d.</p> <p>I suggest that her colourful, impoverished background informs her work: from fragile, nervy Cynthia in Secrets and Lies, to brassy, self-pitying Mari in Little Voice. But she doesn\u2019t buy it. \u201cThere\u2019s a clue in the job title \u2013 actor,\u201d she once said. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to murder someone to play a murderer.\u201d She says Cynthia came out of director <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/mikeleigh\">Mike Leigh</a>\u2019s improvisatory discussions and rehearsals where you work collectively to find the character. She drew on a couple of people she knew, notably for Cynthia\u2019s \u201cgenerosity and her ability to invade your space \u2013 that was the germ\u201d.</p> <p>She found working with Leigh liberating. \u201cIt made me realise how lazy I\u2019d been before. I loved the experience of creating this character, getting under her skin. It\u2019s not just a question of learning the lines and saying them in the right order.

Little Voice and the well-liked comedy Saving Grace quickly followed, but the 2000s saw a run of turkeys: Pumpkin, Sonny, The Sleeping Dictionary, Beyond the Sea. Did that bother her? \u201cI sometimes wonder why,\u201d she says. \u201cThere was one very funny film that people love \u2013 I\u2019ve played it at charity dos: Plots with a View. It never even opened here.\u201d</p> <p>She says that, just as you mustn\u2019t let the plaudits go to your head, so you can\u2019t dwell on the failures. \u201cI don\u2019t make the film work. It\u2019s a team of people. You can make a beautiful cake and put it in the oven, and then someone opens the oven door too soon and it\u2019s ruined. It\u2019s not just your contribution. Even if it\u2019s a huge success, it\u2019s not because of you.\u201d Can she sense whether a film is going to work as it\u2019s being made? \u201cSometimes you can get a feeling it\u2019s all right,\u201d she says, \u201cbut then you can have a very rude awakening.\u201d </p> <p>Failure in theatre is worse, she says, because you have to go out there night after night knowing it isn\u2019t working. She recounts a 1970s National production of Thomas Bernhard\u2019s The Force of Habit, which was a disaster of historic proportions. \u201cThe director said the day before press night, \u2018Try it differently.\u2019 What do you do with that? We could see the funny side, though. You want with all your heart for it to be good, but it ain\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>Blethyn\u2019s ability to laugh at herself, and treat the triumphs and disasters with equanimity, has sustained her career.

They were not buried on the day their deaths, as Islamic custom would usually dictate, to allow family members to fly in from around the world.</p> <p>Naiyyar\u2019s daughter-in-law, Qaisar Khan, said he was a regular visitor to Karachi. His most recent trip was to prepare for the wedding next summer of one of his sons. \u201cHe was a very cautious person but you never think a thing like this will happen to you,\u201d she said. \u201cThe fact that the brothers tend not to get together very often only adds to the pain.\u201d</p> <p>Ali bin Sufyan, a spokesman for the Sunni sectarian group Lashkar-e-Jhangvi al Almi (LeJ-A), claimed responsibly for the attack, saying \u201cthere is no room for the enemies of the companions of the prophet Muhammad in Pakistan\u201d, a reference to the country\u2019s Shia minority.</p> <p>It was the fourth attack on a <em>majlis</em> in Karachi in October, and the third one involving a women-only event.</p> <p>The house was close to both a local police station and a checkpoint manned by the Rangers, a paramilitary force given sweeping powers three years ago to impose law and order on Karachi, a city infamous for its criminal gangs and militant groups.</p> <p>Prominent Karachi Shias, particularly medical doctors, are frequent victims of \u201ctarget killings\u201d by Sunni supremacist groups, often carried out by gunmen on motorbikes.</p> <p>The police said they had not been aware a <em>majlis</em> was taking place at the house. \u201cIf they had informed us, we would have provided security to them,\u201d said Qamar Zaib Satti, a spokesman for the city police.</p> <p>Satti said a special team had been formed to find the culprits, and a reward of 2m rupees (\u00a315,000) had been offered for information leading to the arrest of the culprits.</p> <p>The group that claimed responsibility for the attack is the international faction of Lashkar-e-Jhangvi, a long-established anti-Shia organisation with its roots in Punjab province.</p> <p>LeJ-A said it played a key organisational role <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/25/quetta-attack-ak-47s-firing-blindly-survivors-pakistan\">in the massacre of more than 60 police recruits in Quetta last week</a>, which was officially claimed by Islamic State. </p>",

What Ms Beyts is seeking to enforce is the right to protect personal data. That is guaranteed by the EU charter of fundamental rights, which requires member states to provide effective remedies when their rights are breached.\u201d</p> <p>The dispute highlights a long-running conflict involving Trump and his resort staff over Scotland\u2019s strong right of access legislation, which gives people the right to walk across private land, such as golf courses and Highland estates, so long as the activity is not disruptive.</p> <p>Dailly said Trump\u2019s company was guilty of \u201ca very cavalier disregard for the rule of law, and acting in a way which is highly oppressive to ordinary members of the public who are going about their lawful business\u201d.</p> <p>Trump admitted he had not heard of Scotland\u2019s right to roam legislation when he gave evidence at a public inquiry in 2008 into whether or not to approve his plans for the resort. </p> <p>After winning that inquiry, Trump has been accused by activists and his neighbours of blocking off the main public path across the course, in breach of the resort\u2019s planning consent.

During that time, 176 of the hospitalized children died.</p> <p>The study found that over 15 years, as the popularity and prescribing of opioids increased, the number of children who were accidentally poisoned or adolescents who attempted to kill themselves also increased.</p> <p>The most dramatic rise in poisonings was among the youngest children. Toddlers between one and four years old had more than twice the rate of poisonings from painkillers in 2012 as they did in 1997. On a population level, researchers estimated that meant 2.6 of every 100,000 toddlers would be poisoned by opioids, from less than one in 1997.</p> <p>Most poisonings were accidental \u2013 probably from toddlers believing the pills were candy.</p> <p>Among teens, the rise was also dramatic but was more likely to indicate attempts at intentional self-harm. Overdoses among adolescents from 15 to 19 years old rose by an estimated 176%, the population of teens hospitalized from opioid poisoning rising from 3.6 per 100,000 in 1997 to 10.1. </p> <p>In the same age group, heroin overdoses increased by 161%.

For a full-time worker it amounts to earning an extra \u00a35,000 a year in the capital, and nearly \u00a32,500 elsewhere, compared with a person on the government\u2019s legal wage-floor (\u00a37.20). That\u2019s a big, life-changing difference.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jul/10/george-osborne-living-wage\">I\u2019m paying my staff a real living wage \u2013 not George Osborne\u2019s version | Martin Whitlock</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It\u2019s a difference, though, that has been partially obscured, not least in the eyes of the media, by the recent rebranding of the minimum wage \u2013 reincarnated as the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.livingwage.gov.uk/\" title=\"\">national living wage</a>\u201d. Many assumed that the ensuing terminological muddle would result in the demise of the voluntary (real) living wage, in a case of death by imitation.</p> <p>Well, it hasn\u2019t worked out that way. The number of living wage employers has doubled since George Osborne first announced his revamping of the minimum wage. That\u2019s a tribute to the employers and campaigners involved. But we need to keep this success in perspective: 6 million workers get paid less than the benchmark.</p> <p>Why, though, are ever more companies signing up? Polls of employers reveal a mix of motives. For some, committing to the living wage is a symbolic act that helps make good on standard corporate mantras about the workforce being a prized asset. Others highlight the desire to aim higher than merely avoiding breaking the law. And, of course, many are simply attracted by the reputational halo-effect that surrounds the living wage. All are welcome.</p> <p>Yet something else is going on too. For a growing number of employers it is the start of a wider shift in their business model: away from viewing workers as a cheap and disposable commodity, and towards one which sees them as a resource that needs to be invested in. An unlikely example is the rethink <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/16/upshot/how-did-walmart-get-cleaner-stores-and-higher-sales-it-paid-its-people-more.html?_r=1\" title=\"\">underway at Walmart</a>, the most iconic low-paying employer in the US. Its management eventually came to realise that acting on declining sales, dirty stores and disappearing customers required a motivated workforce. Pay levels were raised from rock-bottom, training boosted and predictability of working hours increased. It\u2019s still early days, but customer satisfaction and sales have both risen too.</p> <p>It\u2019s a tale with echoes in the UK. When <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-33590439\" title=\"\">Ikea decided to embrace the real living wage</a> \u2013 resulting in a pay-rise for thousands of workers \u2013 it did so as part of a wider commitment to hours-security and workforce training. Likewise when the small but rapidly growing craft brewery <a href=\"https://www.brewdog.com/lowdown/blog/brewdog-is-now-a-living-wage-employer\" title=\"\">BrewDog took the same step</a>, not only did two-thirds of the staff get a pay rise but zero-hour contracts were ditched as well. The result? Staff turnover plummeted and employee satisfaction has soared.</p> <p>The scale of the change that some employers are embarking upon, together with the living wage\u2019s greater coverage, brings with it new responsibility. Now, more than ever, it needs to be \u2013 and be seen to be \u2013 a robust and credible benchmark.</p> <p>That\u2019s why the <a href=\"http://www.livingwage.org.uk/living-wage-commission\" title=\"\">Living Wage Commission</a>, created to oversee the rates, has reviewed the <a href=\"http://www.livingwage.org.uk/calculation\" title=\"\">underlying methodology</a> and the data on which it relies. Its view is that the benchmark must, above all else, tell employers and employees the minimum that needs to be paid if households are typically to reach an acceptable, if modest, standard of living.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The calculation underpinning the living wage may be complicated but the moral intuition behind it is not</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>This means it must be rooted in an assessment of the cost of living as determined by the price of a basket of goods and services that the public itself deems to be essential. Consequently the contrasting methodologies that hitherto set the living wage rates in London and the rest of the UK have been aligned. When the price of this basket goes up, upward pressure on the living wage results. The corollary is that the living wage won\u2019t be driven by other factors that people may be concerned about, such as wider trends in earnings or inequality.</p> <p>These technical but vital improvements occur at a time when the living wage campaign faces new challenges and opportunities. Over the coming year a spike in inflation, expected slower growth and Brexit uncertainty may make potential employers more cautious. Yet to dwell on the problems is to misjudge the moment. A diverse set of factors \u2013 concern over the \u201cleft behind\u201d following the Brexit vote; a surge in unease about conditions at work following the Sports Direct scandal; the stunning success of the <a href=\"http://fightfor15.org/\" title=\"\">Fight for $15 movement</a> across America; and, just possibly, the change in personnel in No 10 \u2013 suggest the campaign for fair pay may be moving with the tide.</p> <p>This isn\u2019t vain hope. Whether it\u2019s the bold decision of the <a href=\"http://www.unison-scotland.org/2016/09/30/unison-welcomes-introduction-of-scottish-living-wage-for-social-care/\" title=\"\">Scottish government to pay all care workers the living wage</a>, or that by the London mayor to expedite its <a href=\"http://www.standard.co.uk/news/mayor/tube-cleaning-and-security-staff-paid-less-than-london-living-wage-a3372951.html\" title=\"\">coverage to all Transport for London\u2019s sub-contractors</a>, there is undoubtedly momentum. Across England a new generation of city mayors are about to be elected on a hazy if heartfelt agenda of \u201cshared growth\u201d. They, too, will need to be champions of fair pay.</p> <p>The calculation underpinning the living wage may be complicated but the moral intuition behind it is not. Building an economy that works for all requires reinforcing change on all manner of things from the welfare state to the fiscal stance. But policy alone won\u2019t suffice. We also need to create a shared civic norm about what constitutes decent pay in the 21st century. On this, progress is being made.</p>",

To the response of \u201cfewer\u201d, Wilders replied: \u201cWell, we\u2019ll take care of that.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/06/demagogues-and-cheats-un-human-rights-chief-condemns-trump-and-wilders\">'Demagogues and cheats': UN rights chief condemns Trump and Wilders</a> </p> </aside>  <p>More than 6,000 people filed official complaints to the police about Wilders\u2019 comments and, nine months later, he was formally charged with racial discrimination and inciting hatred. The maximum sentence is two years in prison, although fines and community service orders are more common.</p> <p>On Monday in court, the panel of judges watched video footage of the speech and read out a list of questions that they wanted to put to the PVV leader, such as \u201cWhat did you intend to gain?\u201d </p> <p>A sample of the 6,474 police complaints was read out in court, with some people saying they had felt \u201csick\u201d, \u201cangry\u201d and \u201ctreated like pariahs\u201d by Wilders\u2019 statements.</p> <p>Judge Hendrik Steenhuis said he had no doubt Wilders would be following the live coverage of the trial and suggested he could reply via Twitter. </p> <p>Prosecutor Wouter Bos expressed his frustration at Wilders\u2019 decision not to attend. \u201cIt would have been courteous of him if we had heard his views via the defence rather than in the newspaper,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Wilders announced his intention to boycott the trial on Friday in a column for the AD newspaper in which he claimed he spoke for \u201cmillions of Dutch people, fed up with the disruption and terror caused by so many Moroccans \u2026 If talking about that is an offence, the Netherlands is no longer a free country, but a dictatorship\u201d.</p> <p>Wilders\u2019s lawyer Geert-Jan Knoops said his client\u2019s decision was \u201cnot sensible\u201d, but consistent with his view of the proceedings against him.</p> <p>The prosecution is expected to submit its sentencing demands on 16 November.</p> <p>Wilders has been the frontrunner for the Netherlands\u2019 parliamentary elections next March for about a year, but the latest opinion polls show him running either neck and neck or just behind the Liberals (VVD) of the prime minister, Mark Rutte, with about 18% of the vote in the highly fragmented Dutch landscape.</p> <p>His shrinking lead has coincided with a steep drop in the number of refugees arriving in the Netherlands since last year when plans to build new centres for asylum seekers led to riots outside town halls.</p> <p>Nevertheless, Wilders has hardened his anti-Islam, anti-EU stance for the election campaign. His party\u2019s draft manifesto includes pledges to shut every mosque \u2013 previously he merely opposed building new ones. It also calls for a ban on the Qur\u2019an and headscarves from government buildings, the tearing up of the Schengen open borders agreement and a \u201cNexit\u201d referendum to follow the UK out of the European Union.</p> <p>Under the Dutch proportional representation system, the leader of the largest party is conventionally given the first shot at forming a government. But these are unconventional times; most other parties have ruled out a coalition with Wilders and, if the district court in The Hague finds him guilty, voters will have to decide whether to endorse a convicted criminal as their prime minister.<br></p> <p>It is not the first time that Wilders\u2019 public statements have landed him in court. In 2011, he was acquitted of discriminating against, and inciting hatred towards, Muslims in interviews in which he denounced Islam as a \u201cfascist\u201d religion. But the case is stronger this time because his comments were directed against a racial group, according to Henny Sackers, professor of administrative criminal law at Radboud University in Nijmegen.</p> <p>\u201cThe European court says you can criticise religion in public even if it shocks, hurts or disturbs,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the case of discrimination on grounds of nationality, you can be guilty of an offence in Dutch law if you provoke social unrest. So I see the chances of a conviction for Wilders as being considerably higher than three years ago.</p> <p>\u201cThose who know our constitutional law say this trial has come at a very unfortunate time for democracy. Whether Wilders is acquitted or convicted, he will present himself as the Dutch Donald Trump, a crusader for the free world. It will always give him a potential electoral advantage.\u201d</p>",

Carney agrees to hand MPs notes of private meetings he had with the chancellor in the run-up to the EU referendum.</p> <p><strong>14 July 2016:</strong> At a scheduled policy meeting, the Bank <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/14/bank-of-england-leaves-uk-interest-rates-on-hold-at-05\">holds interest rates at 0.5%</a>, confounding City analysts, who had expected a collapse in business and consumer confidence to convince policymakers to support the economy and cut the cost of credit.</p> <p>However, the Bank puts households on notice that a rate cut is certain if the economic situation fails to improve over the next month.<br></p> <h2>Rate cut to shore up economy</h2> <p><strong>4 August 2016:</strong> The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/04/bank-of-england-cuts-uk-interest-rates\">Bank cuts interest rates</a> for the first time in more than seven years and expands its electronic money printing programme in a bigger than expected package of measures designed to prevent a post-Brexit vote recession. The move brings relief to borrowers, but angers savers, who have been getting low returns for years due to rock-bottom interest rates.</p> <p><strong>9 August 2016:</strong> The Bank\u2019s post-Brexit economic recovery plan <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/09/banks-post-brexit-strategy-hits-snag-as-gilt-buyback-falls-short\">gets off to a stumbling start</a> when it is unable to buy as many government bonds as it needs from major City investors. Threadneedle Street must get reluctant investors to part with government bonds, also known as gilts, in order to provide additional stimulus to the economy under its \u00a360bn QE programme.</p> <h2>Carney defends pre-EU referendum warnings</h2> <p><strong>7 September 2016:</strong> Carney rejects claims that the Bank <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/07/mark-carney-serene-about-bank-of-englands-brexit-stance\">overcooked warnings of a hit to the economy</a> after the Brexit vote, despite growing signs that the downturn will be shallow. Under fire from leave campaigners, the governor says he is \u201cabsolutely serene\u201d about the Bank\u2019s warning of a possible downturn in economic growth and its preparations for the impact from the Brexit vote. But the Tory MP Jacob Rees-Mogg accuses Carney and the monetary policy committee of going too far in their warnings.</p> <p><strong>15 September 2016: </strong>The Bank leaves the door open to another interest rate cut this year, but decides that the safest option is to wait and see if the economy can continue to weather the initial shock of the Brexit vote.</p> <p><strong>16 September 2016:</strong> Carney reveals that his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/16/mark-carnage-carney-fields-questions-from-coventry-school-children\">childhood nickname was \u201cCarnage\u201d</a>. He tells an audience of schoolchildren in Coventry that he likes Dairy Milk chocolate, dogs and the Specials \u2013 but not Craig David. </p> <h2>Carney responds to May\u2019s QE criticism</h2> <p><strong>6 October 2016: </strong>Theresa May prompts questions about a rift between Carney and Downing Street after she <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/05/theresa-may-consigns-cameron-to-history-in-populist-speech\">criticises the impact of quantitative easing</a> in her Conservative party conference speech, saying \u201cpeople with assets had got richer, people without them had suffered\u201d. </p> <p>Carney backs the prime minister\u2019s call to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/06/theresa-may-has-ditched-osborneomics-but-what-will-she-replace-it-with\">rethink Britain\u2019s economic policy</a> and rejects the idea that criticism of the side-effects of unconventional measures <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/06/mark-carney-backs-prime-ministers-call-for-economic-shakeup\">amounted to an attack</a> on the independence of the Bank.</p> <p>Carney says: \u201cI entirely agree with the spirit of what the prime minister said. I have long said that monetary policy has been overburdened. There needs to be a better balance of monetary policy, fiscal policy and structural policy.\u201d</p> <p><strong>14 October 2016:</strong> Carney says the Bank <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/14/prices-to-continue-rising-warns-bank-of-england-governor\">will not take instructions on policies</a> from politicians, a week after Theresa May took a swipe at the impact of the its actions on \u201cordinary\u201d people. Speaking at Birmingham town hall as part of the Bank\u2019s Future Forum, Carney says it becomes difficult for Threadneedle Street when politicians comment on its policies rather than its objectives.</p> <p><strong>21 October 2016:</strong> Michael Gove becomes the latest senior Conservative to criticise the governor, accusing Carney of being intolerant of criticism and lacking in humility.</p> <p>Gove <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/21/mark-carney-michael-gove-criticism-thought-crime-bank-england\">compares Carney to the Chinese emperor Ming</a>, whose \u201cperson was held to be inviolable and without imperfections\u201d and whose critics were flayed alive. <a href=\"http://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/6f669c40-96fb-11e6-914a-7a36010296b9\">Writing in the Times</a> (paywall), Gove says: \u201c[Carney\u2019s] position is held to be independent and without any error. And so any criticism of his actions is regarded as a thought crime.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Will he stay or will he go?</strong></h2> <p><strong>25 October 2016:</strong> Carney indicates that an onslaught of criticism of his performance by the Conservative establishment will not influence <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/21/should-he-stay-or-should-he-go-mark-carney-faces-big-decisition-as-he-weathers-attacks\">whether he stays in his post</a> beyond 2018. Asked by a House of Lords committee whether high-level interference will force him to leave, the Bank\u2019s governor says he will not be swayed by political issues as he weighs up the option of departing in two years or extending his contract by a further three years to 2021. </p> <h2>He stays ... for an extra year</h2> <p><strong>31 October 2016:</strong> Financial markets <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/30/mark-carney-may-announce-decision-to-quit-thursday-bank-of-england\">grow impatient for an indication</a> from Carney as to when he will leave his post, following a barrage of criticism from Eurosceptic MPs about his approach to Brexit. An announcement is expected by Thursday, when the Bank next presents its economic forecasts. But sources say Carney is equally likely to delay the announcement until later in November and will take the decision <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/25/mark-carney-political-issues-stay-job-bank-england-lords-tory\">based on his personal circumstances</a>. </p> <p> </p> <p>Theresa May <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/31/theresa-may-support-mark-carney-full-term-bank-of-england-governor\">gives her full backing to Carney</a> and praises his efforts to steer the UK economy through the post-Brexit vote period during a Downing Street meeting.</p> <p>Finally, in a 6pm announcement, Carney ends weeks of speculation about his future <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/31/mark-carney-extra-year-bank-of-england-governor\">by agreeing to stay on as governor of the Bank until Brexit negotiations with the EU have ended in June 2019</a> - adding an extra year to his original five year term. </p>",
  "<p>Have you got one of the best paid jobs in the UK? <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/oct/26/weekly-uk-earnings-rose-2015-biggest-increase-since-financial-crash\">The Office of National Statistics (ONS) has released its Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings 2016</a>, and we\u2019ve looked at the top 10 highest paid jobs in the country and what you need to do to get one of them. </p> <p>To obtain the data, the ONS surveyed a random sample of 1% of all the workers who carry out each occupation, using 2015/2016 pay-as-you-earn (PAYE) tax records. </p> <p>This means bonuses are included, but self-employed workers and celebrities who don\u2019t appear on company payrolls are excluded. Information about niche occupations \u2013 for example, salaried professional footballers or TV presenters \u2013 has also been suppressed by the ONS to avoid identifying individual pay packets. </p> <p>So which jobs have made it into the Top 10 this year? Who got the biggest pay rise? And how does the pay of the highest earners in the land compare with the average pay of all full-time employees in the UK, who, according to the ONS, earned \u00a334,414 and typically received a 2.3% pay rise this year? </p> <h2>1.

Shareholders can take the credit for this, a spokesperson for the Confederation of British Industry says. \u201cShareholders now have a binding vote on executive pay policies and, encouragingly, we are seeing them become more active in this area.

Keep your condensed milk in a safe place. Here comes Dolores the lawless!</p> <p>Westworld\u2019s favourite host, the wholesome rancher\u2019s daughter with big dreams (admittedly dreams that usually involve fire and corpses) has gone rogue. She\u2019s broken out of her loop, hooked up with some guests, formed a gang of bandits, performed a robbery and shot up some fat soldiers without even blinking. Though that last one may be because her eyes are programmed that way.</p> <p> Dolores, along with William, Logan and their captive host Slim have embarked on a new plotline in Westworld. Dolores can\u2019t tell it\u2019s a plotline, so all she sees is a bunch of amoral depravity. But she\u2019s on the lam, so what the heck. Under the instruction of mysterious underworld figure El Lazo, the gang hold up a wagon laden with explosives. This, they are reliably informed, is the best way to get a reputation as a bunch of badasses, impress some dangerous Confederate mercenaries and finally enjoy the innocent bliss of going to \u201cwar\u201d.</p> <p> The gang pull a fetching set of kerchiefs over their faces and hold up the wagon, manned by a bunch of Yankee soldiers. Logan, being the little dirtbag we all know and loathe, is bang up for some murder with his robbery. But the Yankees turn out not to be the docile opponents Logan is used to and start beating some shades of schmuck out of him. With such a twist, it falls to William to save the day. Will professes not to be into the whole shoot-and-shag side of Westworld, but he does seem cut out for it and shoots three soldiers dead, one of whom was in the process of strangling Logan to (we presume) not quite death.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"44b30f11f4d13069eb27a9ab569dd468bd6f7246\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/44b30f11f4d13069eb27a9ab569dd468bd6f7246/0_0_5760_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dolores and William are troubled by the shoot-and-shag side of Westworld.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dolores and William are troubled by the shoot-and-shag side of Westworld.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: HBO</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p> Dolores is troubled by all of this. Like William, she finds casual acts of violence a little dispiriting, particularly when the end game is to get involved in something even more violent. But after returning the wagon, Dolores discovers that El Lazo has gone and double-crossed the gang. He\u2019s stolen the nitro and plans to use it to blow up the Confederates who are in fact racists and deserve it (wonder if they\u2019ll be voting next Tuesday?). Dolores runs to tell William and plot their escape, but before they can vamoose, the Confederates rumble the plot and surround our young couple. What will happen? I\u2019ll tell you what will happen: Dolores shoots the lot of them dead. William pretends to be shocked that a host could do such a thing, but really we know he\u2019s just jealous.</p> <h2> Those of us who have been paying keen attention to this series noted something funny about El Lazo. In many ways, he looked oddly similar to the guy who\u2019d just been killed by the Gunslinger in this very same episode. Yes El Lazo is Lawrence and, if my understanding is correct, our heroes have embarked on the \u201cmaze\u201d storyline that so fascinates the Gunslinger.</h2> <p> As for the Gunslinger, last week he and Lawrence were the best of pals. This week the host is just a mobile blood bag. The Gunslinger slices Lawrence\u2019s throat and uses haemoglobin, or whatever type of science madness it actually is, to reflate a near-dead Teddy. The only host to have ever survived an assault by Wyatt, Teddy is now more useful to the Gunslinger than Lawrence and in the bad lands of Westworld, there\u2019s no time for sentiment.</p> <p> The one exception to the no-sentiment rule is Ford, who likes nothing more than telling a rambling story about when he was a kid and there was a hungry dog. Ford springs a surprise on the Gunslinger this week by materialising in a cantina and quizzing him on his mission. We don\u2019t learn much, beyond the fact that the Gunslinger believes Arnold is behind the maze and that Wyatt has been developed to stop him getting to the heart of it. He also hints that he may have chucked some money at the park to stop it from going under after Arnold\u2019s death. On Ford\u2019s part we see he has programmed hosts to prevent him from coming to any harm, using Teddy to stop the Gunslinger from giving him a pasting.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"30fce5962e8a7281accf81d56c0a28aaaad18aa6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/30fce5962e8a7281accf81d56c0a28aaaad18aa6/0_179_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ford springs a surprise on the Gunslinger by materialising in a cantina and quizzing him.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ford springs a surprise on the Gunslinger by materialising in a cantina and quizzing him.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: HBO</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2> There has been a lot of talk about whether the Gunslinger is William a few decades into the future. The fact of Dolores\u2019s memories of the Gunslinger and her losing Teddy to Wyatt before meeting William makes me wonder how that can be true. But as we see quite frequently \u2013 Dolores spotting herself in this week\u2019s day of the dead procession, for example \u2013 maybe memories are not to be trusted. </h2> <p>If William <em>is</em> a young Gunslinger then as EVP of the Logan family corporation he might have a bit of money to keep the park afloat in future. At the same time though, you wonder why it\u2019s taken him 30 years to get to the end of the maze, especially when it\u2019s printed on all of Lawrence\u2019s crates.<br></p> <h2> Back in corporate HQ, we get a little more sense of what the men in white coats really get up to. Turns out it\u2019s reprogramming birds. </h2> <p>A dude called Felix is one of the lab technicians charged with fixing up hosts after they get all stabbed, shot and smashed up by the guests. His colleague thinks they are nothing more than \u201cbutchers\u201d, but Felix believes there is beauty in all of Ford\u2019s living creatures and takes it on himself to restore a broken bird to life.<br></p> <p> He does so by fiddling with the avian code. The first time he tries it doesn\u2019t go so well and the feathered friend makes a noise like a 3am techno set at the Berghain. But Felix is not to be dissuaded and gives it another go. This time he\u2019s successful, which gets a round of applause from host Maeve, who was supposed to be lying inert on an operating table. \u201cHallo Felix,\u201d she says, with the reanimated bird on her finger, \u201cit\u2019s time you and I had a chat.\u201d</p> <p> While we\u2019ve been used to seeing Maeve have funny turns, we\u2019ve not yet seen her turn so funny as to be inhabited by an entirely different persona. But that appears to be the case here, and my money would be on her being inhabited by the spirit of Arnold. So what is Arnold up to? In other HQ-related could-be-Arnold news, Eloise discovers that her rogue woodcutter has a \u201claser-based satellite uplink\u201d stashed up his arm. Dolores dreams she\u2019s got one in her too. She\u2019s also receiving direct instructions from Arnold and lying to Ford about him during naked interviews. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t know, I didn\u2019t tell him anything\u201d, she says out loud after their encounter. Ford, meanwhile, believes that Dolores is the last remaining connection to Arnold, and that he may even be uploaded up in her bonce. \u201cYour mind is a walled garden, not even death can touch the flowers blooming in there\u201d, he says like he\u2019s just entered his blank verse into the sixth-form poetry competition. Mysterious and mysteriouser.</p> <h2> Notes from the prairie</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7ebab116265f1504eab3b85ea5a6f73c8b0736d8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7ebab116265f1504eab3b85ea5a6f73c8b0736d8/0_102_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Logan, the little dirtbag we all know and loathe.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Logan, the little dirtbag we all know and loathe.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: HBO</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p> William and Logan finally fall out this week with William leaving his cynical brother-in-law to the mercy of the Confederados. But before the pair split, they share the following exchange, which made me laugh, though not for the right reasons. </p> <p>\u201cYou feel bad because you killed,\u201d Logan screams. \u201cBut there\u2019s no such thing as heroes or villains, it\u2019s just one big circle jerk!\u201d</p> <p> \u201cI think that philosophy says more about you than it does about the world\u201d, replies William coolly. Though I think philosophy might be stretching it a bit.</p> <p> Logan\u2019s confederate beating, and his Yankee strangling, make me wonder once again what limits there are on violence in Westworld. I can imagine that, had William not interceded, the host would have stopped throttling Logan before he blacked out. But what if a confederate smash across the chops accidentally caused an embolism? Or a heart attack? Surely no amount of insurance could cover that?</p> <p> With the new city added to the map this week I\u2019m starting to believe that Westworld is less of a park and more of an actual nation state. This town, full of gold-painted prostitutes and gratuitous orgy scenes, is not even on the fringes of the park \u2013 you\u2019ve got to go to war to find that. Covering the lot would definitely be an ask for a weekend away.</p> <h2> Questions for next week</h2> <p> What does Arnold look like? Is Arnold all of us? Are we all Arnold?</p> <p>Could Dolores turn out to be a bad guy like whatserface in Ex Machina?<br></p> <p>What ever happened to sweary narrative guy?

  "<p>It\u2019s always worth remembering where Titanfall developer Respawn Entertainment came from. The studio was founded by the creators of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/call-of-duty\">Call of Duty</a> and staffed by some of the most skilful stalwarts in the first-person shooter genre; from the best entries in Activision\u2019s behemoth franchise all the way back to 2002\u2019s Medal of Honor: Allied Assault, Respawn\u2019s collective has made great cinematic shooters, and this team knows how to reinvent, rethink and reignite the genre. Titanfall 2 expands the multiplayer concept established by the original sci-fi shooter two years ago, adds an incredible single-player campaign and acts as a bold reminder of how brilliant this band of veteran gunslingers really is.</p> <p>As with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/mar/14/titanfall-review-respawn-xbox-pc\">the original game</a>, Titanfall 2\u2019s core ideas exist on two parallel playing fields. Firstly, there\u2019s the Pilot, a superhuman soldier capable of hyper athletic wall-running and double-jumping, with split-second reflexes that make for unrivalled marksmanship. They are the masters of any gun, the ultimate commander of any squad, and they treat the battlefield more like a jungle gym than a place of warfare. Obstacles and debris are not safe cover in the eyes of a Pilot. Instead they are opportunities for movement in order to turn impossible odds into a cakewalk.</p> <p>The majority of your time is in the shoes of these fetishised powerhouses, and their insane sense of speed and agility gives Titanfall 2 a freneticism that isn\u2019t apparent in any other shooter this side of Doom. But each Pilot has a not-so-secret weapon to add to their odds. They are symbiotically partnered with a Titan \u2013 a big robotic death machine armed to the teeth with devastating weaponry and unique abilities: shields, teleportation and chest-mounted super lasers make these giant tank-like bipeds a formidable force in any war zone.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4ea93d35260b98c3c2517308480726d472331ed8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4ea93d35260b98c3c2517308480726d472331ed8/0_0_1799_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Titanfall 2\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Immensely satisfying\u2019 \u2026 Titanfall 2.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Respawn Entertainment</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Whether you\u2019re on-foot as a Pilot or in the cockpit of a Titan, Titanfall 2 is immensely satisfying, but it\u2019s the interplay between man and machine that makes it such an impeccably crafted shooter. Despite the David v Goliath odds, Pilots can use their speed and agility to take the battle to other Titans. A team of parkour-savvy Pilots armed with special anti-Titan weapons can bring one to its knees with surprising brevity, while a team of Titans is a formidable (brute) force on any battlefield, capable of an incredible level of destruction that far outweighs the fact that a Titan\u2019s shield no longer regenerates in multiplayer mode.</p> <p>It\u2019s here in its online modes that Titanfall 2 shows off its most substantial improvements, with fabulously designed and visually varied maps, each rife with countless avenues for invention. Every window is an opportunity for a flanking kill, perfectly placed for a swift double jump straight in; every corridor is a potential face-off; and every open space is a playground of wall-running and cover-hopping while the Titans come rocketing down from the heavens to aid their human companions.</p> <p>It\u2019s this trio of verticality, the way that Respawn makes feats of wonder so easy to attain, and the seamless transition between Pilot and Titan that make Titanfall 2 feel so exciting. Its breakneck pace means multiplayer games are short, bite-size adrenaline rushes full of excitement and ever-turning tides. In a game of Attrition (basically Team Deathmatch) there\u2019s always the tug between two teams as each vies for a victory, while this simple struggle is made far more nuanced in a game of Bounty Hunt, a new mode that has each team killing for cash, with temporary opportunities to bank all the money you\u2019ve earned. Any time you get killed your unbanked cash total halves, so it\u2019s a game of increasing tension as the clock ticks down to zero.</p> <p>With eight multiplayer modes and a handful of great maps, Respawn expands upon the relative barebones of the original game. It also adds customisation options to your Pilot and Titan \u2013 a bigger list of abilities, new types of grenades, better perks and a larger roster of different weapons, each with their own individual customisable attachments. An entirely new lineup of Titans makes the game far broader, too, and there\u2019s a greater sense of ownership to your metal pet thanks to cosmetic paint jobs. Compounded together, this refined progression system and the brilliant tools therein give Titanfall 2 far longer legs than its predecessor, offering out slews of upgrades and rewards that give you a constant urge to try out new things.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d7315a1982676681ea6afb47eb6aa8c8e614ad60\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d7315a1982676681ea6afb47eb6aa8c8e614ad60/301_0_3310_1987/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Titanfall 2\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Titanfall 2\u2019s campaign is a rollercoaster of creative invention.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Electronic Arts</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In its single-player mode, Titanfall 2 not only fills in the missing half that the original game lacked, demonstrating Respawn\u2019s deft ability to craft a campaign that\u2019s tuned with pitch-perfect precision and brimming with fun ideas. It starts with a short movie lauding the abilities of the Pilots, showing off their immense skills, before launching you into the shoes of junior warrior Jack Cooper. Jack himself is as dull as they come, but it\u2019s the relationship between him and his newly inherited Titan, BT 7274, that gives Titanfall 2\u2019s campaign its surprising sense of heart.</p> <p>From there, Titanfall 2\u2019s campaign is a rollercoaster of creative invention \u2013 at its best it feels like a conveyer belt of Nintendo-esque level design magnificence, so capable of creating excitement around a fundamental mechanic in one minute, and so brave to throw it away entirely in the next, all for the sole purpose of introducing more ideas immediately afterward. Titanfall 2 quickly establishes a wonderful conflict between vulnerability and empowerment that feels utterly engrossing. And then it\u2019ll throw in a time travel mechanic where you can play with two completely different timelines, or a section where an entire construction facility is shifting around you, as you do your best to navigate your way through it without getting crushed by a moving wall. It\u2019s also a genius move to allow you to change your Titan load-out on the fly in the campaign, letting you experiment with each setup before you head online.</p> <p>The basics of running and gunning remain a satisfying constant with which to leapfrog on to these interesting concepts, and while it\u2019s a shame that its storytelling efforts never reach the supreme heights of its mechanical underpinning (it assumes a lot of knowledge, features some really hammy antagonists and delves into the lore of a world that\u2019s rife with colour but not much substance), the game\u2019s narrative troubles melt away the moment you concentrate on playing.</p> <p>That\u2019s perhaps where Titanfall 2 is most successful. While its contemporaries focus on new ways with which to shock and excite on screen, Respawn makes the simple act of playing feel superlative. Its multiplayer is bigger and better, with the necessary depth and momentum to take it beyond these first few months after release, while its short but exciting single-player mode has the craft of some of the best campaigns of the last decade.

  "<p>A former top Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) official has accused Congress of putting pharmaceutical company profits ahead of public health in the battle to combat the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/may/09/opioid-addiction-appalachia-tennessee\">US\u2019s prescription opioid epidemic</a>.</p> <p>Joseph Rannazzisi, head of the DEA office responsible for preventing prescription medicine abuse until last year, said drug companies and their lobbyists have a \u201cstranglehold\u201d on Congress to protect a $9bn a year trade in opioid painkillers claiming the lives of nearly <a href=\"http://www.asam.org/docs/default-source/advocacy/opioid-addiction-disease-facts-figures.pdf\">19,000 people a year</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/oct/05/opioid-production-us-epidemic-drug-enforcement-administration\">DEA reduces opioid production in US amid painkiller addiction epidemic</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Rannazzisi, director of the agency\u2019s office of diversion control for a decade, said the drug industry engineered recent legislation limiting the DEA\u2019s powers to act against pharmacies endangering lives by dispensing disproportionately large numbers of opioids. He also accused lobbyists, who have spent hundreds of millions of dollars in recent years to influence opioid legislation and policy,<strong> </strong>of whipping up opposition to new guidelines for doctors intended to reduce the prescribing of the painkillers with a close resemblance to heroin.</p> <p>\u201cCongress would rather listen to people who had a profit motive rather than a public health and safety motive,\u201d said Rannazzisi. \u201cAs long as the industry has this stranglehold through lobbyists, nothing\u2019s going to change.\u201d</p> <p>The former DEA official, who is a pharmacist, was particularly scathing about politicians he said claim to be at the forefront of fighting the opioid epidemic while doing the bidding of the pharmaceutical industry in Congress.</p> <p>\u201cThese congressmen and senators who are using this because they are up for re-election, it\u2019s a sham. The congressmen and senators who are championing this fight, the ones who really believe in what they\u2019re doing, their voices are drowned out because the industry has too much influence,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Charges that Congress is too beholden to pharmaceutical companies have been levelled for years, particularly over controversial legislation such as the law that barred the government from negotiating lower prices for drugs bought for the Medicare and Medicaid systems. But Rannazzisi says the influence on opioid policies is particularly disturbing because so many lives are being lost and he sees members of Congress claiming to take the issue seriously during election campaigns but acting differently in Washington.</p> <p>That\u2019s a criticism echoed by Democrats in the Senate, who issued a report earlier this month criticising Republicans for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/14/congress-passes-opioids-bill-anti-addiction-legislation\">passing sweeping legislation in July to combat addiction</a>, the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act (Cara), but refusing to fund it. The report, <a href=\"https://www.finance.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/101116%20Opioid%20Treatment%20Gap%20Report%20Final.pdf\">Dying Waiting for Treatment</a>, likened the Republican response to the opioid crisis to \u201cusing a piece of chewing gum to patch a cracked dam\u201d. \u201cThe bill was \u2018comprehensive\u2019 in name only; without funding, its policies are little more than empty promises,\u201d the report said.</p> <p>Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, who released the report, acknowledged the influence of drug companies and their lobbyists on Congress but he has also been critical of their sway over federal institutions. \u201cThere is no question that the powerful opioid manufacturers have a disproportionate voice, a disproportionate amount of influence, in these debates,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Rannazzisi clashed with Congress over a law passed in April reducing the DEA\u2019s power to suspend the licenses of distributors and pharmacists accused of dispensing excessive amounts of opioids without abiding by regulations.</p> <p>The Ensuring Patient Access and Effective Drug Enforcement Act was initiated by an industry-funded group, the Healthcare Distribution Management Association, which claimed that the DEA was misusing its powers to go after pharmacists and drug distributors which made minor mistakes in their paperwork. Rannazzisi said the agency only targeted those that were \u201csending millions of drugs down the street\u201d. </p> <p>Several states have sued pharmaceutical distributors, including West Virginia, which accused a dozen companies of dumping 200m opioid pills on the state knowing many were dispensed to addicts able to get prescriptions from crooked doctors and pharmacists. </p> <p>The new law requires the DEA to warn pharmacies and distributors if they are in breach of regulations and to give them a chance to comply before licenses are withdrawn. Rannazzisi said that amounts to a \u201cfree pass\u201d for institutional drug traffickers.</p> <p>\u201cThis doesn\u2019t ensure patient access and it doesn\u2019t help drug enforcement at all. What this bill does has nothing to do with the medical process. What this bill does is take away DEA\u2019s ability to go after a pharmacist, a wholesaler, manufacturer or distributor,\u201d he said. \u201cThis was a gift. A gift to the industry.\u201d</p> <p>Rannazzisi riled some members of Congress by telling them they were \u201csupporting criminals\u201d with the law. Representative Tom Marino of Pennsylvania said he was immensely offended by the comment and told the DEA to \u201cseek collaboration with legitimate companies that want to do the right thing\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cCorporations have no conscience,\u201d Rannazzisi told the Guardian. \u201cUnfortunately, with my job, I was the guy who had to go out and talk to families that lost kids. If one of those CEOs went out there and talked to anybody, or if one of those CEOs happened to lose a kid to this horrible, horrible domestic tragedy we have, I\u2019d bet you they\u2019d change their mind.</p> <p>\u201cWhen you sit with a parent who can\u2019t understand why there\u2019s so many pharmaceuticals out in the illicit marketplace, and why isn\u2019t the government doing anything, well the DEA was doing something. Unfortunately what we\u2019re trying to do is thwarted by people who are writing laws.\u201d</p> <p>Asked why he thinks the bill passed over the objections of the DEA, Rannazzisi gave a short derisive snort.</p> <p>\u201cThe bill passed because \u2018Big Pharma\u2019 wanted it to pass. The DEA is both an enforcement agency and a regulatory agency. When I was in charge what I tried to do was explain to my investigators and my agents that our job was to regulate the industry and they\u2019re not going to like being regulated,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Industry groups have spent hundreds of millions of dollars in lobbying to stave off measures to reduce prescriptions and therefore sales of opioid painkillers. Among the most influential drug industry groups is the Pain Care Forum, co-founded by a top executive of Purdue Pharma \u2013 the manufacturer of the opioid which unleashed the addiction epidemic, OxyContin \u2013 and largely funded by pharmaceutical companies. It <a href=\"https://www.publicintegrity.org/2016/09/19/20201/pro-painkiller-echo-chamber-shaped-policy-amid-drug-epidemic\">spent $740m</a> lobbying Congress and state legislatures over the past decade according to the Center for Public Integrity.</p> <p>Recipients of political donations from the industry included Senator Orrin Hatch, chairman of the finance committee, who took $360,000 and Representative Mike Rogers, who received more than $300,000, according to the CPI. The two politicians were instrumental in legislation establishing a panel to examine treatment of pain that critics said had close ties to industry-funded groups.</p> <p>Wyden has been critical of what he says is pharmaceutical company influence over policy through other expert panels, including the government-run Interagency Pain Research Coordinating Committee (IPRCC). The senator said it had been used to \u201cweaken\u201d guidelines drawn up by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) that discouraged doctors from prescribing opioids so widely. </p> <p>Earlier this year, Wyden wrote to the secretary of health and human services, Sylvia Burwell, protesting about the presence on the IPRCC of experts and activists he said had close links to pharmaceutical companies, including a scientist who holds a chair funded by a $1.5m endowment from Purdue.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/jun/15/opioid-painkiller-sharing-overdose-study\">Opioid painkiller study: 66% of patients keep leftover pills after treatment</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got a panel that\u2019s certainly got a fair number of people that have a vested interest in this problem of overprescribing. That\u2019s something you\u2019ve got to root out,\u201d said Wyden. \u201cThe role of the pharmaceutical companies on these advisory panels troubles me greatly. Science is getting short shrift compared to the political clout of these influential interests.\u201d</p> <p>Wyden criticised the presence of others on the IPRCC including Penney Cowan, founder of the American Chronic Pain Association, which he said \u201creceives corporate support from 11 companies that manufactured opioid-based drugs\u201d and Cindy Steinberg, national policy director of the US Pain Foundation which he said \u201creceives substantial funding from opioid manufacturers\u201d.</p> <p>Cowan, who founded her association 36 years ago before prescription opioids were widely available, said the organisation is focused on education and relies on funding from drug companies because it is not available from other sources. </p> <p>\u201cUnfortunately no one cares about pain so they don\u2019t fund it,\u201d she said. \u201c[Pharmaceutical companies] don\u2019t have any influence over us. I don\u2019t know that we would have survived the last 36 years if they did.\u201d</p> <p>Steinberg, who has lived with chronic pain for 15 years after she was crushed under a filing cabinet, said the US Pain Foundation receives \u201cunrestricted educational grants\u201d from pharmaceutical companies and other foundations but these do not influence policy. </p> <p>\u201cThese companies have no input into the materials the foundation creates,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Steinberg said she was \u201chonoured to serve on the IPRCC\u201d and that its criticisms of the CDC guidelines were legitimate. </p> <p>\u201cThese included the fact that the guidelines were based on \u2018weak\u2019 or \u2018very weak\u2019 scientific evidence,\u201d she said. \u201cAs a result of the IPRCC comments, the guidelines were subsequently put out for public comment, went to a larger group for review and revised to some extent which was a good thing.\u201d</p> <p>In December, a congressional committee piled pressure on the CDC by launching an investigation into how it drew up the guidelines. Other members of Congress suggested it was the job of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which is more sympathetic to the position of the pharmaceutical companies, not the CDC to advise doctors on prescriptions.</p> <p>In the end the committee turned up no evidence of wrongdoing but the pressure led to changes to the CDC guidelines and a delay in their release that Rannazzisi said weakened their impact.</p> <p>\u201cThe industry got Congress to put pressure on the CDC over their prescribing guidelines. That was just a farce,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Dr Andrew Kolodny, director of Physicians for Responsible Opioid Prescribing, said resistance to the CDC guidelines is part of a pattern of opposition to measures that reduce sales of opioid pills. \u201cThe opioid lobby has very actively blocked interventions that might result in more cautious prescribing or reduced prescribing. They\u2019ve very clearly defended their financial stake in the status quo,\u201d he said.</p>",
  "<p>If your mind ever wanders back to the childrens\u2019 TV show Rentaghost, chances are you\u2019ll think of the gaudy 80s version, with characters like Hazel the McWitch, Nadia Popov and Dobbin the Pantomime Horse.</p> <p>But it didn\u2019t start that way at all. The first series of Bob Block\u2019s comedy for kids aired in 1976 with only three main ghosts. Five episodes are newly available on the BBC Store in time for Halloween \u2013 and they are a lot bleaker than you might imagine. Here\u2019s why:</p> <h2><strong>The show starts with a main character nearly getting killed</strong></h2> <p>Fred Mumford is already dead, as it happens, but kids watching in 1976 weren\u2019t to know that. Rentaghost opens with him appearing suddenly in the middle of a road and having to leap out the way of a speeding car.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5d4470b6b0634d6b9f2d59d22b6b0f912cb56573\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5d4470b6b0634d6b9f2d59d22b6b0f912cb56573/1_0_1852_1112/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Fred Mumford narrowly avoids a speeding car in the opening scene of Rentaghost\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fred Mumford narrowly avoids a speeding car in the first scene of Rentaghost.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>He is concealing his death from his parents to get money<br></strong></h2> <p>Mumford has been dead for six months, but his parents don\u2019t know that; they think he went on a trip abroad. Consequently, episode one largely consists of him visiting his folks, avoiding mentioning that he is a ghost, then borrowing \u00a330 to pay the rent on Rentaghost\u2019s London offices, which he explains is his new business venture.</p> <h2><strong>His dad doesn\u2019t like him anyway</strong></h2> <p>There is no love lost between Mr Mumford and his son. John Dawson played the role of Fred\u2019s dad as a man constantly suppressing an explosion of exasperated rage. In one episode, as the ghosts try to entertain hospital patients with a magic show, Mumford Jr ends up trapped in a filing cabinet. There follows a scene where his dad delivers a long rant about what a disappointment he has always been, then shoves his head back down into the cabinet to close it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f0c1d7c1d700127e092568936f6a7492b1e6f4e9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f0c1d7c1d700127e092568936f6a7492b1e6f4e9/0_0_1926_1156/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Fred Mumford stuck in a filing cabinet in Rentaghost\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fred Mumford stuck in a filing cabinet in Rentaghost.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>The whole show is essentially about failure</strong></h2> <p>Fred Mumford is dreadful at being a ghost. Hubert Davenport, played by Michael Darbyshire, is bullied by his long-dead Victorian \u201cMama\u201d who regularly appears to scold him about the vulgarities of the modern world. And jester Timothy Claypole, performed majestically by Michael Staniforth, is unable to control his mischievous whims. Their business is a disaster (as epitomised by the chart on their wall).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6b1fd44093afbcf63fe82994598d3ba48b8ee52f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6b1fd44093afbcf63fe82994598d3ba48b8ee52f/0_0_1845_1364/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A graph showing the failings of the Rentaghost team\" width=\"1000\" height=\"739\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A graph showing the failings of the Rentaghost team.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>They get out of scrapes by making people think they are having mental health episodes</strong></h2> <p>To avoid a brush with the law, the ghosts repeatedly disappear and reappear a boat and a tent before a bemused policeman until he calls off the chase, and radios his control room to say he needs to take the day off. On another occasion, to conceal the fact that Mr Claypole has made a patient disappear, Mr Davenport pretends to be the ill man in his hospital bed. The nurse examining the ghost imposter is, naturally, unable to detect a pulse, and leaves the ward believing her patient has died.</p> <h2><strong>It\u2019s nowhere near as bad as you might expect</strong></h2> <p>The sets and costumes are obviously low budget and 70s. Aimed at kids, much of the show\u2019s appeal was in the slapstick comedy and silly visual puns Claypole cannot resist making. Rewatched as an adult, it is much more obvious that Block\u2019s writing owes a huge debt not just to pantomime, but also to the fine British tradition of farce at the theatre.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1ad43ea87aeb81932ed05cc99026361d1212ee0c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1ad43ea87aeb81932ed05cc99026361d1212ee0c/1_0_1865_1120/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The original cast of Rentaghost (l-r): Michael Staniforth as Timothy Claypole, Anthony Jackson as Fred Mumford and Michael Darbyshire as Hubert Davenport\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The original cast of Rentaghost, from left: Michael Staniforth as Timothy Claypole, Anthony Jackson as Fred Mumford and Michael Darbyshire as Hubert Davenport.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>It will ruin one of Doctor Who\u2019s villains for you</strong></h2> <p>At the end of his era as the Doctor, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/oct/28/doctor-who-changed-face-and-transformed-tv-for-ever\">Patrick Troughton</a> faced a renegade Time Lord, the War Chief, who was helping an evil alien race.

The War Chief was played menacingly by Edward Brayshaw.</p> <p>A few years later, Brayshaw took on the role of hapless Mr Meaker, the Rentaghost crew\u2019s landlord \u2013 who frequently ends up on the receiving end of whatever has gone awry with the ghost\u2019s plans. By episode four he complains to Fred Mumford with the immortal line of dialogue: \u201cSince you\u2019ve been renting this office I\u2019ve had a birdcage on my head, a premature appendicitis, and now a king-sized lamb chop dropped on me.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"946a6e038a7dbfa0156e9d1e63ac668abcae6266\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/946a6e038a7dbfa0156e9d1e63ac668abcae6266/0_0_1307_1308/999.jpg\" alt=\"Edward Brayshaw in Doctor Who and in Rentaghost\" width=\"999\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Edward Brayshaw in Doctor Who and in Rentaghost.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>The theme tune is the earworm to end all earworms</strong></h2> <p>Perhaps the most worrying aspect of rewatching Rentaghost some 40 years after it first aired is the fact that for days afterwards, you\u2019ll find the theme tune popping into your head at inopportune moments.

That showed \u201cclear intent to aid one political party over another\u201d, Reid said, adding a claim that Comey was not releasing information linking the Trump campaign to Russia. Reports said FBI investigators had known for weeks they might find pertinent emails on Abedin\u2019s device, which was shared with her estranged husband Anthony Weiner, who is under investigation over alleged illicit texts to a minor. Clinton called on Comey to \u201cput it all out on the table\u201d; Donald Trump said the email scandal was \u201cworse than Watergate\u201d. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/30/hillary-clinton-donald-trump-fbi-director-comey-emails\">Clinton emails inquiry: FBI gets warrant as Comey told he may have broken law</a></p> <h2>Will Hillary Clinton lose?<br></h2> <p>The Democrat is losing support just as the Republican is experiencing a resurgence.

The chairman of the UK <a href=\"http://www.ajr.org.uk/\">Association of Jewish Refugees</a> said that for many, applying for citizenship of a country that treated their ancestors so badly was a \u201cconsiderable psychological challenge\u201d.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/30/uk-descendants-of-jewish-refugees-seek-german-citizenship-after-brexit-vote\">Descendants of Jewish refugees seek German citizenship after Brexit vote</a></p> <h2>Cubs hopes stay alive as fans wave the W flag</h2> <p>The W flag is what the Cubs traditionally fly at Wrigley Field, writes Greg Couch, and it went up on Sunday night when the Cubs beat the Cleveland Indians 3-2 in Game Five of the World Series \u2013 the first time the team has won in the series at home since 1945.

  "<p><strong>Hometown:</strong> Chelmsford.<br></p> <p><strong>The lineup:</strong> Connar Ridd (vocals, guitar). </p> <p><strong>The background:</strong> Connar Ridd goes by the name of Freak (he prefers to use all capitals, \u201cnice and loud and bold\u201d, so you can see him coming). You can certainly hear him a mile off, this 19-year-old one-man band whose bleepified, poppy but riff-heavy grunge\u2019n\u2019roll nods, on his debut EP, to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2015/apr/01/nirvana-10-of-the-best\">Nirvana</a> and Arctic Monkeys. It really is all him (live, two mates handle bass and drums). He then adds assorted effects, \u201ckeyboards in\u201d the synth-bass parts, and does all the vocals: his studio bedroom set-up comprises a cheap laptop, Logic Pro, a midi keyboard off eBay and a microphone his parents bought him for Christmas. </p> <p>Let\u2019s not get carried away: by his age Paul Weller had recorded two albums with the Jam, and Alex Turner had just put the finishing touches to Whatever People Say I Am, That\u2019s What I\u2019m Not. Freak is not some freakish prodigy. But that EP is still an impressive first foray from someone who, until recently, was stacking shelves at the Co-op in Chelmsford. He had too much on his mind, too many angry thoughts, to bother with the banalities of quotidian existence. Ridd \u2013 who goes by the name of Freak because that\u2019s how he feels (\u201cI\u2019ve always been the weird one,\u201d he says) \u2013 went to the same school as <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/nov/21/new-band-of-the-week-rat-boy-no-32\">Rat Boy</a>, another high-energy young man using a peculiarly British form of rap-rock to express personal panic and societal rage. OK, maybe \u201crage\u201d is a bit strong, but he does sound as though he\u2019d like to do some damage with a spray-can.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Freak\">  <iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/271048668%3Fsecret_token%3Ds-kCLB9&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;visual=true\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>\u201cIt could be applied to anything,\u201d he says of the track Someone Help Me, a three-minute burst of bottled-up frustration with an eruptive, brass-enhanced chorus that you\u2019ll be humming down the street even as you kick the kerb. \u201cWhether it\u2019s me going from thinking everything is great to working in the Co-op, or everything in the country going to shit. It\u2019s something for people who are angry.\u201d</p> <p>What did they put in the water at Chelmer Valley high school to produce these disaffected youths? </p> <p>He laughs. </p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s quite mad.\u201d</p> <p>He sounds perky enough, even if his songs are full of dark thoughts: \u201cI don\u2019t want to pretend again / I\u2019m tired of this pain,\u201d he sings on Someone Help Me. At one point in the latter he sounds as though he\u2019s declaring, \u201cKill me, kill me!\u201d but actually it\u2019s \u201cfill me, heal me\u201d. Does he hate himself and want to die?</p> <p>\u201cIn some ways,\u201d he says. \u201cIn person I\u2019m a lot happier and full of energy, but when I write my songs it gets quite deep.\u201d</p> <p>True. For a minute there he had us worried. </p> <p>\u201cYeah, my manager was a bit concerned,\u201d he says of the often misheard lyric to Someone Help Me. \u201cSo I told him, \u2018I\u2019m all right!\u2019\u201d</p> <p>What Happened? finds him declaring, \u201cI am so empty\u201d while I Like to Smile When I\u2019m Sad is about \u201cputting on a face to everyone else when you\u2019re having to do shit you don\u2019t wanna do\u201d. Think Kevin the Teenager produced by Rick Rubin, Ridd\u2019s favourite producer.</p> <p>He only started operating as Freak last November, issuing that debut EP in February 2016. Before that, he put up a series of covers on YouTube of artists ranging from Alicia Keys to System of a Down, sung in choirboy-pure tones, but he\u2019s taken them down now. For a while he was in a death metal trio, with his older brother Brandon, called Kill the Freak, in the vein of Cannibal Corpse and Napalm Death. His dad got him into grunge and punk, even taking him to see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2015/feb/17/cult-heroes-charlie-harper-uk-subs-punk\">UK Subs</a>.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen them three or four times \u2013 they\u2019re wicked,\u201d he says of the punk band fronted by 72-year-old Charlie Harper. \u201cHe signed my ticket, which was incredible. I was well starstruck. It was really inspiring to see someone still passionate about it, and still doing it.\u201d</p> <p>He spent a year studying music production at a college in London, but felt alienated from his peers.</p> <p>\u201cIt was very druggy \u2013 every conversation was about how they were doing mushrooms or weed or cocaine and I\u2019m not about that life,\u201d he says. </p> <p>Freak prefers to focus on his music, hence the concentrated violence of tracks such as What Happened?, with its riff reminiscent of a sped-up Seven Nation Army, or Floating High, which he might want to be a little cautious about anyone litigious from Nirvana HQ hearing. Every song hits hard and and has an irresistible momentum, even if some of the lyrics \u2013 and the habit Ridd has of putting a fast-repeat vocal snippet in at every opportunity \u2013 are a bit 1989-Channel-4-backwards-baseball-cap-yoof-culchur. </p> <p>At the moment Ridd has his own imprint, Freak Recordings, although major labels are interested: he even spray-painted a handful of CD cases for his EP, stuck them in Freak-designed envelopes and sent them off to labels, blogs and the music press. What next? World domination?</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d say so,\u201d he says with disarming nonchalance. \u201cI just want to get to the people who need the music I make \u2013 people who are angry, aggressive and want to have fun. World domination? Why not?

  "<p>One of the most significant moments in my life came one afternoon about five months ago, when I was volunteering in an elephant sanctuary in Thailand. I was tidying the park as part of my duties when I came across a beautiful, solitary elephant with a badly deformed front leg. Concerned as to why she was alone and curious about her physical health, I asked a guide.</p> <p>Kabu was 26 years old, like me. She had been rescued about a year before but sadly never settled with a herd. She had been used for the illegal logging trade since infancy, pulling huge weights up and down steep mountain ravines. During one of these tortuous journeys, a log came loose, rolled into her and badly broke her leg. Forced to continue working, her injury never healed. When Kabu was finally rescued she was weak and traumatised. When she arrived at the park she had tears rolling from her eyes \u2013 from relief, said the guide.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/12/why-the-guardian-is-spending-a-year-reporting-on-the-plight-of-the-worlds-elephant-population\">Why the Guardian is spending a year reporting on the plight of elephants</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Wanting a photograph with her, I stood next to her, as I had done with the other elephants. I was not prepared for what happened next; Kabu mirrored my movement and leant into me. As she moved in closer, I could feel her sheer strength against my body. This gave me a sense of safety and security, so I pressed against her further as if to hug her. Moving closer towards her head, I looked into her dark eyes for several moments, and rubbed the top of her trunk. As she looked back at me, I was amazed. Here was an animal who had gone through unspeakable horrors, yet was still willing to trust and give affection to a human.</p> <p>We were in the <a href=\"https://www.elephantnaturepark.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Elephant Nature Park</a> (ENP), a 250-acre sanctuary for rescued Asian elephants like Kabu, founded by award-winning conservationist Lek Chailert (known as the \u201c<a href=\"https://broadly.vice.com/en_us/article/the-elephants-they-will-not-let-her-go-meet-thailands-elephant-whisperer\" rel=\"nofollow\">elephant whisperer</a>\u201d). Chailert was born in a mountain village in northern Thailand and grew up in a family that owned an elephant. From a young age, she was devoted to their care. She witnessed the traumatic circumstances in which many Asian elephants live and set about creating safe spaces for them.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5dbd834eb0bb779204adf3f290bc5f4a4a2870c8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5dbd834eb0bb779204adf3f290bc5f4a4a2870c8/0_0_4631_3087/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An elephant is chained while performing in Yangon zoo during a special celebration in front of a crowd\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An elephant is chained while performing in Yangon zoo during a special celebration in front of a crowd.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ye Aung Thu/AFP/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It is a little-known fact that Asian elephants are even more endangered than their African cousins. Perhaps<a href=\"http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/7140/0\" rel=\"nofollow\"> just 50,000 are left</a>. In Thailand there are about 6,000, half of which live in captivity. The ancient tradition of capture and domestication not only raises welfare problems, it is also a strain on the dwindling wild stock. On top of this many, some Asian elephants are subjected to a centuries-old domestication ritual known as \u201cthe crush\u201d, which breaks the spirit of a baby elephant to make it submit to human control.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Here was an animal who had gone through unspeakable horrors, yet was still willing to trust a human</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/04/thai-elephant-attack-spotlight-abuses-animal-tourism\">Animal rights groups report</a> that some elephants in the south-east Asian tourism industry \u2013 whether being used for riding or appearing to calmly paint pictures in the street \u2013 have gone through some form of the crush.

This treatment may last for several weeks, and observers describe cases where food, water and sleep are restricted, and injuries are inflicted on the animals.</p> <p>Elephants are highly sentient, evolved animals, who form lifelong relationships with their families. Anyone who has spent any time with these beautiful creatures cannot doubt their sensitivity and intelligence, and the risk of lifelong damage from treatment such as the crush. Some elephants become withdrawn or behave aggressively towards humans \u2013 both examples of how psychological damage can be manifested.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2016/jun/14/elephants-soothed-with-lullabies-in-thailand-sanctuary-video-report\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/4y5dk\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2543123\"            data-video-name=\"Elephants soothed with lullabies in Thailand sanctuary \u2013\u00a0video report\"            data-video-provider=\"ITN\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57606706e4b005ab05d2100f\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"http://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11596099&amp;format=video/mp4\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2016/06/14/160614elephantlullaby_large.3gp\"> <source src=\"http://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11596099&amp;format=video/webm\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2016/06/14/160614elephantlullaby_small.3gp\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/06/14/160614elephantlullaby.m3u8\"> </video> <figcaption>Sangduen \u2018Lek\u2019 Chailert, the founder of Chiang Mai\u2019s Elephant Nature Park, sings lullabies to the elephants in her care.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>The ethos of the ENP sanctuary, surrounded by rainforest and rivers, is for rescued elephants to roam completely free, for them never to work and to live out their lives in peace, happiness and fun. They form new family bonds, and some even have calves. While it is still visible how much pain and suffering these animals have endured \u2013 some are blind and others are too emotionally unpredictable to interact with humans \u2013 most of the elephants are relaxed and enjoy their freedom. ENP largely raises money through sponsorship and tourism. Visitors can stay for one day, or volunteer for up to two weeks (as I did).</p> <p>And how had I ended up here? A few months earlier I had been sitting in therapy, wrestling with conflicting urges to harm myself or to help myself. After experiences of abuse in my childhood, I began self-harming before I was 13. At this particular moment I was wrestling with hallucinations and beliefs that by hurting myself the disturbing images would go away. This time, however, I realised there could be another solution. I needed to do something life-changing, something that would take me out of my own head and into the world.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Anyone who has spent any time with these beautiful creatures cannot doubt their sensitivity and intelligence</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I didn\u2019t initially know where to go. But after some research I found the Elephant Nature Park. Being a vegan and animal advocate, I felt it had the right ethos. While both my therapist and my wife were encouraging, they did have some concerns. Would I be well enough to travel far away? Would I be able to stay safe if I encountered anything that triggered urges to self-harm? What if being in such an environment were disheartening as opposed to inspirational, as I hoped? Although I was giddy with excitement about my grand adventure, I had to admit that these were concerns I shared.</p> <p>It took an overnight train ride from Bangkok to reach Chiang Mai province in northern Thailand, near the border with Burma. On the first day, everyone met at the ENP office in Chiang Mai city centre for registration and transport to the sanctuary itself. Our minivans were equipped with DVDs about how not to get trodden on by an elephant, something which had fleetingly crossed my mind before but was now crystallised as a legitimate possibility.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b88e9d2e66fb4e9eda76f55bb30ff327b61319e8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b88e9d2e66fb4e9eda76f55bb30ff327b61319e8/0_134_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Asian elephant\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Elephants are highly sentient, evolved animals, who form lifelong relationships with their families.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Athit Perawongmetha/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Upon arrival, 50 or so excitable individuals waited to be paired up with roommates and organised into our volunteering groups. They were a lovely group of various ages from all over the world. </p> <p>Our first task was unloading the watermelon truck and filling up the \u201celephant kitchen\u201d. We each got into single file, passing along watermelons from the van to the many giant shelves that housed the elephant food. I was hit with the heady aroma of sweet fruit, and willed my body to adapt to the heat while shifting the heavy loads.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/12/why-the-guardian-is-spending-a-year-reporting-on-the-plight-of-the-worlds-elephant-population\">Why the Guardian is spending a year reporting on the plight of elephants</a> </p> </aside>  <p>My first elephant encounter was in fact rather unexpected; a sneaky trunk peeking around from the back of the kitchen, curious to identify any chopped up pieces of fruit ready for eating. I instantly knew that this was going to be a wonderful fortnight.</p> <p>The volunteering itself focuses on providing care for the elephants such as bathing, food preparation (I have seen enough watermelons to last a lifetime), and accompanying them to the vets. Volunteers also look after the park; scooping poop (there is a proper technique to this; shovel from the back of the pile, lift up from the centre) tidying shelters and planting trees. </p> <p>All of us as volunteers were incredibly touched to have the opportunity to stay here and look after the elephants. My group of new friends and I would come together each meal time with new stories and experiences to share, and certain times of day became graced with new importance: 3pm, time to help bathe the elephants; 4pm, feeding time opposite our own dinner table. It would be unrealistic to say that I did not experience intrusive thoughts or that my hallucinations stopped outright, but I felt no need to act upon them, and my happiness far outweighed any negative emotions. The routine and the socialising was important, but the fact that I was helping these amazing creatures was by far the most important factor.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/08/indian-zip/giv-310757P5ysgFlayR1/\" data-alt=\"Range of Asian elephants\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/08/indian-zip/giv-310757P5ysgFlayR1/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Range of Asian elephants</a> </figure>  <p>I think being in such an environment was therapeutic for all. There is a wealth of anecdotal evidence that animal assisted therapy can have a real impact on the social and psychological wellbeing of those struggling from both physical and psychological problems. I have a degree in psychology, and being here highlighted to me that there is a need for more formal studies to be conducted to build up the evidence base.</p> <p>I have returned from ENP with a renewed sense of wanting to face and survive my own pain, actively working towards giving up self-harm. Although I have had challenging moments, I have not self-harmed once since coming back and I am approaching a year free of self-harm altogether. Kabu continues to be a source of inspiration. If an elephant can go through the crush and survive forced labour without giving up hope and trust, then there is no reason why I cannot overcome my own trauma.</p> <p><em>Jake Dorothy lives in Cardiff, United Kingdom, with his wife and rescue cat.

  "<p>There are so many legitimate reasons to dislike the havoc wreaked on the UK\u2019s children by Michael Gove, we surely don\u2019t need to fabricate any more. Right now, school children are going back into the endless exercise in nostalgia and pointless cramming that GCSEs have become: the return to a joyless neo-Victorian curriculum, imposed against the advice of teachers. As a parent, I reap the distress of Gove\u2019s so-called reforms daily. And I haven\u2019t even mentioned Europe.</p> <p>Perversely though, the gaiety of the nation has certainly been upped by the idea that he neglects his own children. He and his wife Sarah Vine <a href=\"http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/michael-gove-left-son-11-9155789\" title=\"\">went to a posh do</a> at the Cheltenham Literary festival and left their 11-year-old son in a super-duper B&amp;B while they went partying. The poor abandoned child was left alone with mobile phone numbers, their two dogs and the staff of the upmarket establishment informed. This has been presented in some quarters as akin to satanic abuse.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/jun/11/david-cameron-daughter-behind-pub\">David Cameron left daughter behind after pub visit</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Indeed this is even worse than when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/jun/11/david-cameron-daughter-behind-pub\" title=\"\">David Cameron forgot one of his brood in a pub</a>.

A porter from the hotel tried to get in touch with the Goves, who didn\u2019t answer the phone as they were so busy raving or their unthinkable equivalent of it. They stayed out later than they said. Alert the media! Well, someone did.</p> <p>This is hardly a crime and the world has gone insane about over-protecting the very children who least need it. It\u2019s not a good idea to leave young children on their own. Substantial neglect certainly occurs. Many families and particularly single parents who work often find it extremely hard to cover every minute of the day. The idea, though, that parents have to hover over their children 24 hours a day to stop them ever being to exposed to any risk or indeed interaction with another adult is barmy.</p> <p>The law is foggy on this and the NSPCC advice is common sense enough. Under 12s should not be left alone for long periods of time because they are \u201crarely mature enough\u201d to deal with an emergency. An emergency in my experience for kids this age is having no Wi-Fi.</p> <p>How might children ever mature though if they are never given any independence? Kids who are driven around, who never walk to school by themselves, who are taught to view all strangers as dangerous, are ill-equipped to deal with the world. The terrible fear that haunts parents of the worst happening and the focus on lone paedophiles has become hysterical. A few years ago I had to have a CRB (now known as DBS) check to accompany my own child on a school trip.</p> <p>These days the buzzwords are safeguarding and resilience. We might ask how these two relate to each other. Spotting actually vulnerable children is one thing, building resilience is another. Giving children a measure of freedom is surely key to this.

Universities need to bear in mind that a lot of people have some sort of non-British background, so I feel they should adapt their courses to try to reflect that. A lot of people aren\u2019t fully British and may want to do a course that helps them to find out more about their own culture. That\u2019s what university\u2019s supposed to be about. It\u2019s not just learning about a subject, but learning about yourself. </p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m interested in social sciences and in the future I\u2019d like to be some sort of activist for Black Lives Matter, or something along those lines. So a degree that has some focus on racial discrimination is the main factor in deciding what course I want to do. It\u2019s been quite difficult to find courses, but I\u2019ve found some.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I go to uni, I\u2019ve told myself that I want to be in a place that has quite a big black population. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s realistic to live in a place that doesn\u2019t have that. I\u2019d like to go somewhere where there are things that I\u2019m used to, like being able to go to the salon and have my hair done properly. Little things like that automatically make you feel a bit more comfortable.</p> <p>\u201cUniversities should be more representative, because I feel that would make people more comfortable. But it shocks me more that we don\u2019t have enough BME [black and minority ethnic] school teachers. Once you\u2019ve got to the point where you\u2019re university standard, you\u2019ve already got your role models put in place. You\u2019ve sorted yourself out enough not to really need a strong role model. But when you\u2019re in primary school and high school, that\u2019s when you need to have role models who are similar to you.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"60218afc3558791e005bfdecbaa415f19b6a0137\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/60218afc3558791e005bfdecbaa415f19b6a0137/40_0_1200_720/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dr Kehinde Andrews, UK\u2019s first professor of black studies.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dr Kehinde Andrews, UK\u2019s first professor of black studies.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Vimeo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>\u2018White privilege dominates\u2019<br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"acc447996b74007c00118b8411ae45269e8a191c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/acc447996b74007c00118b8411ae45269e8a191c/0_1_667_667/500.jpg\" alt=\"Dr Kalwant Bhopal\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>Dr Kalwant Bhopal</strong><br><em>Professor of education and social justice at the University of Southampton</em></p> <p>\u201cUniversities are white spaces, in which whiteness \u2013 and white privilege \u2013 dominates. Our research shows, for example, that black and minority ethnic staff are very scared to make complaints about racism. And when they do, it\u2019s either dismissed as a \u2018clash of personalities\u2019, or it\u2019s seen as taking something out of context. So what happens is the victim becomes the villain and white identity is protected at all costs.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s interesting that universities pride themselves on being very international. They always wave this flag: \u201cWe\u2019re very international; we\u2019re very inclusive.\u201d And that may well be the case (because the numbers of international students is very high), but the curriculum does not address that internationalisation. The curriculum that\u2019s presented is very eurocentric. These are worrying times for universities: we say we live in a global society, but if you walk into any university and see who is on that senior management team, it\u2019s predominantly white.</p> <p>\u201cThis all impacts on black and minority ethnic students. In the research I\u2019ve done, many people in their final year felt there was a lack of role models. There is some excellent good practice going on in universities, so things may well change in the future. But we\u2019ve got a long way to go in terms of race, and that\u2019s reflected in the statistics.\u201d</p> <h2>\u2018If there\u2019s ever a problem, it\u2019s tackled pretty easily\u2019</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"c2518eeadb8ea14bd8b92991e81dec944758edf4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c2518eeadb8ea14bd8b92991e81dec944758edf4/23_4_239_239/239.jpg\" alt=\"Nuzhat Fatima\" width=\"239\" height=\"239\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>Nuzhat Fatima</strong><br><em>Welfare and diversity executive officer, Loughborough Students\u2019 Union</em></p> <p>\u201cAt my institution, I feel that if there\u2019s ever a problem, it\u2019s tackled pretty easily. We have a very good relationship with our vice-chancellor, so if our students are unhappy and we want to make a change, we directly contact the university. They understand that in order for the university to thrive and move forward, they have to support students. But when I look at other universities I don\u2019t really see their vice-chancellors interacting with the students that often. I think having that kind of relationship is key.<br></p> <p>\u201cBeing of Muslim background, coming to a university like Loughborough has been very beneficial for my personal development. And to have this position which celebrates student diversity is very important to me.<br></p> <p>\u201cInstitutional racism exists \u2013 just like institutional sexism and homophobia exist. And because it exists in society, it can\u2019t just be eradicated overnight. But here at Loughborough, we obviously try to tackle every single thing we can, in terms of diversity and inclusion.\u201d<br></p> <h2>\u2018Race does not exist by itself\u2019<br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"23fda6aaf94305bd9d09130b93e15c90661d65b0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/23fda6aaf94305bd9d09130b93e15c90661d65b0/219_91_495_495/495.jpg\" alt=\"Dr Deborah Gabriel\" width=\"495\" height=\"495\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>Dr Deborah Gabriel<br></strong><em>Lecturer at Bournemouth University and founder of Black British Academics</em></p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think we should only be talking about race. Race does not exist by itself; it works in conjunction with other factors like ethnicity, culture and gender. So I don\u2019t see how you can possibly not adopt an intersectional approach to this.<br></p> <p>\u201cThe latest figures from <a href=\"https://www.hesa.ac.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hesa</a> show there are 105 black professors. That\u2019s obviously a dismal figure, but what\u2019s more dismal is that only 30 of those are women. So we need to talk about race and gender, as well as other sites of intersection, like class. We should be concerned with how racial disparity impacts on all ethnic groups and not just present this dichotomy of white and black. <br></p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s very little news coverage on the transformation that\u2019s taking place across the sector. The public is given this picture that it\u2019s absolutely dismal and racist in higher education, but that\u2019s not quite the case. Racism is embedded in the education system, just as it is throughout society, but I wouldn\u2019t single out higher education institutions as producing racism. I\u2019m not suggesting at all that universities are beacons of race equality, but I think we should talk more about the transformation and where that\u2019s coming from.<br></p> <p>\u201cA lot of the momentum is coming from the students, I\u2019m very proud to say. There have been so many student-led events and <a href=\"https://www.staffs.ac.uk/assets/NUS%20Liberation%20Equality%20and%20Diversity%20in%20the%20Curriculum%202011_tcm44-65179.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">reports</a> where they are defining and documenting the issues very articulately and making their voices heard.

We\u2019ve got a bigger issue here about how we deal with growing inequality throughout society in the UK. For me, it\u2019s not only about race anymore \u2013 it\u2019s about the whole environment.<br></p> <p>\u201cWe keep on saying that we\u2019ve got a problem. What are we doing about it? Progress remains slow, so we need to do something different. We don\u2019t need more data to tell us that social mobility for these groups is poor. We know it. But we don\u2019t seem to have a working strategy yet for encouraging and developing talent.<br></p> <p>\u201cHowever, I think we\u2019ve got to be careful to say that universities, at a strategic level, aren\u2019t doing anything about this. I would be surprised if the executive groups in universities aren\u2019t talking about this all the time. But it becomes very hard to see how that actually translates in the curriculum. A framework already exists for promoting equality, diversity and inclusion within the curriculum. I would encourage universities to really examine their processes to ensure that these issues are confronted at the curriculum design stage.<br></p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not easy, but I think the time for finger-pointing and blaming is over. In the interest of our students we need to be seen to do something proactive about it and be more transparent about what we\u2019re doing.

For example, when we talked about terrorism, people would make generalisations about Muslims. We think of universities as a place where your ideas and views get challenged, but that\u2019s a utopian version of university. My general experience isn\u2019t that. </p> <p>\u201cThe curriculum is white. If people are coming in with a wealth of knowledge and experience that they\u2019ve accumulated culturally in their communities, and that\u2019s not reflected in the curriculum or the things we\u2019re able to do, then we\u2019re not going to get people engaging very much. I\u2019ve challenged this several times when I\u2019ve spoken to lecturers, but they say: \u201cOh, we\u2019ve already written the module.\u201d People are really reluctant to change. I think a lot of this is connected to the way lecturers and academics have been treated in the last five to 10 years. There\u2019s been more casualisation \u2013 my university has lots of casual staff \u2013 and academics have been saddled with a lot of work. So they don\u2019t have a lot of paid opportunity and time to rework these things that students say to them.</p> <p>\u201cThe way universities are set up now, there\u2019s no accountability.

Steven Barnett described it as <a href=\"https://twitter.com/stevenjbarnett/status/791742503250751488\">a fundamental misreading</a> of the situation. Tim Fenton accused me of <a href=\"http://zelo-street.blogspot.co.uk/2016/10/greenslade-sells-pass.html\">selling the pass</a>. There were Twitter nods of agreement from Evan Harris and M\u00e1ire Davies, among several others.</p> <p>It was tough to be accused of siding with the media establishment after 24 years of doing the opposite. During that time I have supported many, many \u201cordinary people who have been lied about and intruded upon by national newspapers\u201d. </p> <p>But that doesn\u2019t mean that I have to accept Hacked Off\u2019s remedy - a form of press regulation established by a royal charter - as the best cure.</p> <p>I concede that I initially thought the charter was a clever way to underpin regulation (although I was disappointed at the clumsy way it came about). I changed my mind when I realised the implications</p> <h2>Why I oppose the royal charter</h2> <p>I know Hacked Off, which represents victims of press misbehaviour, sincerely thinks it has found the best possible way to stop abuses by newspapers while maintaining press freedom.</p> <p>In so doing, its ideologues have placed their faith in the political establishment. They believe the charter is safe in the hands of MPs and peers and that the conditions that might lead to it being altered are highly unlikely.</p> <p>But my lack of respect for what they call the media establishment (which, incidentally, is itself a mythical construct) is nothing like as great as my lack of respect for the so-called political establishment.</p> <p>Given an opportunity during one those not infrequent febrile clashes between parliament and the press, politicians could conceivably vary the terms of the charter. Even if this sounds far-fetched, because of the numbers necessary to bring it about, it is possible. So why take the risk?</p> <p>Does the BBC feel safe from political interference because it has a royal charter? Parliamentary control of the corporation\u2019s budget has had the effect of reducing editorial staff and thereby reducing news coverage. </p> <p>And while I\u2019m on that point, did anyone notice how the BBC failed to cover the Guardian\u2019s story about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/oct/25/theresa-may-private-brexit-warning-speech-to-goldman-sachs-audio\">the Theresa May/Goldman Sachs tapes</a>? Was that a caution born of its concern about not rocking the government boat?</p> <h2>Why I oppose the charter\u2019s compulsion</h2> <p>Under the charter, a press regulator must secure official recognition by satisfying 29 conditions. They are not unduly onerous. One of them, which I welcome, is the creation of a low-cost arbitration arm.</p> <p>This has two benefits: it would allow people without the necessary funds to sue newspapers to have their legal complaints heard; it would be cheaper also for well-heeled complainants (and, of course, newspaper publishers).</p> <p>But here is the rub. Any publisher not regulated by an approved regulator - even if it were to set up an arbitration service - would find itself subject to a provision of the courts and crime act 2013, known as section 40.<br></p> <p>This would compel publishers to pay the legal costs, win or lose, for both itself and the complainant.<br></p> <p>Can anyone be surprised that publishers are up in arms at that possibility? The government, having realised the implications after intense lobbing by publishers, has yet to trigger section 40, but it\u2019s on the statute book and could be introduced at any time.</p> <p>Whether you see this as a carrot to lure publishers into an approved regulator or a stick to compel them to do so, it is a form of blackmail and, by extension, inimical to freedom of expression.</p> <p>Why? Because it is conceivable that a publisher outside the system, such as the Guardian or Private Eye, could face crippling legal costs. </p> <p>You may feel unsympathetic towards wealthy publishers - although they are thinner on the ground, and certainly less profitable, than was once the case - but the iniquity of them funding litigants is obvious.</p> <h2>Section 40 - an imagined injustice</h2> <p>Most of my critics have taken issue with my imagining a scenario in which section 40 opens the door to injustice. </p> <p>I argued that people could sue over, say, a case of phone-hacking and reverse the burden of proof by requiring a newspaper to prove a negative (ie, that it hadn\u2019t done so).</p> <p>Such a claim, it was suggested, would be thrown out by a judge because people would have to produce concrete evidence.</p> <p>I am not so sure, having watched certain lawyers over the years play fast and loose with defamation claims (and also privacy claims). While we\u2019re on the subject of establishments, let no-one underestimate the legal establishment\u2019s capability to use a bad law to its fullest extent... and beyond.</p> <p>Not being sure is the problem here. We are facing the possibility of a calamity, and all because, back in those frenetic post-Leveson report days, there was a failure to agree a proper settlement that would have drawn both sides, victims and villains, together.</p> <p>I\u2019m with you, Brian, Steven, Tim, Evan and M\u00e1ire on the need to ensure our press behaves itself, but not at the cost of allowing an arcane instrument of state to threaten press freedom.</p>",

The organisation seems to forget that the law can sometimes be an ass, especially when it comes to protecting hen harriers. Why would a new law to licence moors be any more effective than one protecting the species - which clearly has failed? At best it is naive and at worst it would yet again let the shooting lobby off the hook.<br></p> <p>Like so many ordinary rank and file RSPB members, I added my name to the petition because I believe that only a ban will allow the hen harrier population to recover.

Their head of nature policy, <a href=\"http://www.rspb.org.uk/community/ourwork/b/martinharper/archive/2016/08/13/100-000-people-call-for-a-ban-on-driven-grouse-shooting.aspx\">Jeff Knott, stat</a>ed: \u201cI\u2019d be amazed if either a ban or licensing was introduced off the back of it\u201d. </p> <p>Given that the petition will have been signed by many of his members, the RSPB\u2019s chief executive, Mike Clarke, would do well to caution his senior staff not to write any further hostages to fortune.<br></p> <p>The RSPB\u2019s stance has also brought it into conflict with many leading conservationists, from the author of the petition, Mark Avery, to the TV presenter Chris Packham. </p> <p>Avery, its former director of conservation for nearly 13 years and my boss when I worked in the RSPB\u2019s research department, has becoming increasingly irate with the society but has declined to publicly criticise it. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/sep/01/chris-packham-slams-shameful-silence-of-britains-conservation-charities\">Packham has gone further</a>, publicly slamming its stance as \u201cshameful\u201d but again stopping short of resigning as its vice-president. <br></p> <p>The reluctance to criticise the RSPB is understandable as no one wants to hand victory to the likes those representing the shooting lobby. As a major landowner itself, the RSPB also finds itself in the unenviable position of having to work with other landowners and gamekeepers on the ground every day. However, its stance has undeniably split the conservation lobby, meaning its voice in parliament during the debate will be considerably weakened. </p> <p>If, as the RSPB predicts, MPs do not back a ban, then the society needs to ask itself some very difficult questions. Could the support of its million-plus members and its influence in parliament have tipped the debate in favour of a ban? And more importantly is its senior management team\u2019s stance now at odds with its membership on the issue? </p> <p>The only sure way to answer this question would be to ballot its members. For the sake of England\u2019s dwindling hen harrier population, this vote cannot come soon enough.</p>",
  "<h2>\u2018We must remember the richness immigrants have brought\u2019<br></h2> <ul> <li>Monica, 51, Vermont, voting for <strong>Hillary Clinton</strong></li> </ul> <p>I live in a tiny rural town in Vermont. The daughter of Peruvian immigrants who overstayed visas back when it took just a few months to get a green card; I\u2019ve worked hard to feel like I belong anywhere. I found my way to Vermont as a young adult and no other place feels like home. I am voting for Hilary Clinton, although my preference would have been Bernie Sanders. Hillary\u2019s approach seems to be informed by her years of experience and that\u2019s what I want in a president \u2013 someone who is intelligent and informed about both policy and process. A Trump presidency would be a \u201cdisaster\u201d as he\u2019s so fond of saying. I get no sense that he has any knowledge of, or worse, the desire to learn about, the issues at all. That\u2019s truly frightening. Trump would further divide our nation \u2013 his rhetoric alone has deepened existing divides. We must remember the richness immigrants have brought to our country. The first priority of the next president must be to unify us, as nothing can be accomplished in the current atmosphere. This has been the ugliest campaign I have witnessed in my 51 years. Trump\u2019s campaign has been embarrassing and dangerous and it will take a while for the nation to recover. One good thing that has come of this cycle is that it has woken people up from apathy and encouraged them to make their voices heard at the ballot box \u2013 for better or worse.</p> <h2>\u2018We have become a politically correct society to our detriment\u2019<br tabindex=\"-1\"></h2> <ul> <li>Anne-Marie, 69, New Jersey, voting for <strong>Donald Trump</strong></li> </ul> <p>Born in 1946, the first year of the \u201cbaby boom\u201d, I am a second-generation American. I earned my BA, MEd and MA in, respectively, history, teaching and journalism. Most of my working life was in publishing. I have been alone since my divorce some 40 years ago. My views do not fit any one party, and my voting history is mixed. I have voted for Democrats and Republicans, and I threw away a vote on Ralph Nader in 2000 because I could not vote for either of the main candidates. I will vote for Donald Trump. He might not change this country \u2013 Congress can obstruct a president, as it has been doing since 2008 \u2013 but if he could, it would be in directions I support: defeating Isis, strict(er) immigration, encouraging businesses to stay or return here, a much better relationship with Russia, and the disestablishment of the politically correct society we have, to our detriment, become. A president\u2019s priorities should be protecting the American land and people, and promoting the general welfare \u2013 here, stateside. I have found the campaign absolutely horrid. The only good thing about election day is that it ends the campaign. </p> <h2>\u2018Trump\u2019s misogyny, racism and general ignorance astound me\u2019<br tabindex=\"-1\"></h2> <ul> <li>Wendy, 63, California, voting for <strong>Hillary Clinton</strong><br></li> </ul> <p>I\u2019m 63 years old, a Democrat, and a retired registered nurse. My husband of 36 years is a retired teacher. We live in Panorama City, a working-class suburb in the San Fernando Valley. This election is the worst I\u2019ve ever seen, and I lived through Watergate and the Vietnam war. Donald Trump\u2019s misogyny, racism and general ignorance astound me. I\u2019m worried that Russia\u2019s attempt to influence the outcome of this election in Trump\u2019s favor might yet succeed. I don\u2019t know who I\u2019m angrier at \u2013 Donald Trump for being a compulsive liar \u2013 or the press for letting him get away with it. Trump\u2019s supporters chanting \u201cLock her up\u201d are the worst. Hillary Clinton is not a criminal! We face serious problems with no easy solutions. Over 20% of our children live in poverty. Climate change is real. We have too many guns and not enough good jobs. Our son is unemployed \u2013 I don\u2019t want Obamacare repealed \u2013 I want it fixed. Hillary has a plan for that. Hillary cares about people, about children and families. She\u2019s a feminist who will appoint supreme court justices who will stand up for women\u2019s rights. Especially if the Democrats take back the Senate, she can get things done. Even Trump conceded that she\u2019s a fighter. This is a historic election and, yeah, I\u2019m excited about it. I didn\u2019t think a woman president would happen in my lifetime. On November 8th, I hope we will elect Hillary Clinton as the first woman president of the United States.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d88c255f6b9784ac704bd2d08318a47aa0ec741a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d88c255f6b9784ac704bd2d08318a47aa0ec741a/0_0_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pumpkin portraits of Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump by Disney artist Joseph Yakovetic, on Hollywood Blvd, 27 October 2016.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pumpkin portraits of Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump by Disney artist Joseph Yakovetic, on Hollywood Blvd, 27 October 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Livingston/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>\u2018I will remain apprehensive until she is president-elect\u2019</h2> <ul> <li>Sarah, 28, Florida, voting for <strong>Hillary Clinton</strong><br></li> </ul> <p>I\u2019m a third-year medical student living in Brooklyn, NY, voting by mail as a Florida resident. My vote this year is unequivocally going to Hillary Clinton. There is a vocal proportion of Clinton voters who make no secret of their reluctant support, whether grudging Bernie Sanders advocates, or voters of any persuasion who oppose Donald Trump only marginally more than they do Clinton. Despite having backed Sanders myself, I take a less noncommittal position: Clinton, far from being the \u201clesser of two evils\u201d, is a remarkably qualified, intelligent candidate whose views largely mirror my own, a stark contrast to the unsympathetic view of her character that is frustratingly widespread. Her proposed policies demonstrate forward thinking that would enable the United States to stand upright as a respected model among nations. I anticipate with hope the improvement of the Affordable Care Act to make healthcare universally affordable, the push to end gun violence, the increase in police accountability, the reform of our prison system, and a social promotion that advances race relations, LGBT rights and gender equity. None of these changes can be expected under the influence of Donald Trump, who sees the truth as tractable, promotes his sexism and narcissism as assets, and in the end, is excessively volatile and unprincipled. It\u2019s embarrassing that Clinton, whose political competence is nigh unparalleled, holds only an uncertain majority over his farcical campaign. While the current poll aggregates are tentatively reassuring, I will remain apprehensive until she is confirmed as president-elect after election day.</p> <h2>\u2018Washington is offering no choice besides disaster\u2019<br></h2> <ul> <li>Geno, 37, Pennsylvania, voting for <strong>Jill Stein</strong></li> </ul> <p>I\u2019m in that middle class suffering from decades of neoliberalism \u2013 involuntarily in debt, in a dead-end job because of health coverage and few options. My household can eat and pay bills most of the time, so we\u2019re luckier than some, but doing much more is a rare treat. The nation needs living wages, progressive taxation, universal healthcare, renewable energy, an end to US aggression, and investment in our future instead of the already-rich. Society should support people over profit. The most wretched excuse for a campaign in our lifetimes has only promised the opposite. The major parties offer a deranged rightwing sociopath provoking global war or a reality-TV buffoon with no actual policy, both of them hopelessly corrupt and staggeringly incompetent. Reinforcing Bush-Obama corporatism isn\u2019t an option. Libertarianism is suicidally shortsighted. We need a progressive administration that\u2019ll keep the grassroots engaged in fighting for constructive, sustainable goals. That\u2019s why I\u2019m voting Jill Stein. It\u2019s already too late to prevent a president Clinton; that\u2019s what the establishment wants and that\u2019s what it\u2019ll get. Of course Trump never had a chance \u2013 he\u2019s only there to scare us towards Hillary. No thanks. I won\u2019t throw my vote away on a felon and war criminal. I\u2019d rather affirm policies I actually support. The alternative is staying home, but I\u2019d rather send a message rejecting business as usual (hopefully amplified a little in a swing state). Washington is offering no choice besides disaster. Our first duty is to refuse to be complicit or legitimize it.</p> <h2>\u2018I\u2019m not so much with her as I am against the fascist Donald Trump\u2019<br tabindex=\"-1\"></h2> <ul> <li>Chris, 50, New York, voting for <strong>Hillary Clinton</strong><br></li> </ul> <p>My name is Christopher; I am a gay African American illustrator and comic book artist living in New York City with my husband who is an Episcopal seminarian. As a Bernie Sanders supporter, allow me to make my position crystal clear: I\u2019m not so much with her as I am against the fascist, racist and misogynist Donald Trump. I would love to have another choice, but unfortunately, with Jill Stein polling even worse than Gary Johnson I\u2019m forced to be pragmatic and vote for Hillary Clinton. Liberal supreme court nominations; banking, healthcare, student loan and immigration reform; increasing living wages, honest discussions of the true effects of mechanization of labor, infrastructure revitalization, climate change, federal enforcement of police reform \u2026 these should be presidential priorities. Will they be under a centrist Clinton administration? Doubtful. Still, it is my sincere hope that the more progressive side of the Democratic party will apply the appropriate pressure. This entire presidential campaign has been a demoralizing debacle, and I for one can\u2019t wait until election day.

But I didn\u2019t start out that way. Although I\u2019ve been a Republican since registering to vote at age 18 I switched to the Democratic party this year in order to vote for Bernie Sanders in the California primary election. Had Sanders won the Democratic primary I wouldn\u2019t be writing this little essay and I would most definitely <em>not</em> be voting for Donald Trump. Let me be clear \u2013 I\u2019m not voting for Trump because I like him. I\u2019m voting for Trump \u2019cause I like Hillary Clinton even less. I don\u2019t think policy positions matter much in a presidential election. Presidents don\u2019t actually get to direct much policy. What matters most to me is leadership. The ability to lead a large organization and inspire those being led. In this respect both candidates have serious liabilities. But Hillary\u2019s appear to be the far more serious breaches of integrity. From her early days on the Nixon impeachment issue to her operation of the state department she has left behind a taint of corruption at the highest levels of government. We are already hearing of the rumblings of disorganization and discontent in both the state and justice department as a result of her corrupting influence. The priority of a president should be to manage the immense federal bureaucracy and inspire citizens. Hillary has proven herself to be singularly inadequate to the task.</p> <h2>\u2018I\u2019m a Mormon Republican voting for Clinton\u2019</h2> <ul> <li>David, 43, Colorado, voting for <strong>Hillary Clinton</strong><br></li> </ul> <p>I\u2019m a westerner, having lived and voted in Utah, Nevada and Colorado. I\u2019m educated, with two postgraduate degrees. I\u2019m also religious, having been Mormon all my life. I\u2019ve been a registered Republican since my first voting experience in 1996. I\u2019m voting for Hillary Clinton. Or, to put it more precisely, I\u2019m voting against Donald Trump. The most important factor for me in voting for any public office is character, and I think it is obvious that Trump has the worst character of any candidate I\u2019ve ever seen. There are many very reasonable objections to Clinton, and I\u2019m really not a big fan of hers, but I don\u2019t think they come anywhere close to the magnitude of Trump\u2019s deep moral flaws. I think Clinton is a very capable politician, and I like her experience in public service. I also think she\u2019s quite moderate, which is what I consider myself to be. Presidents are important, but they can\u2019t do all the things for which people often hold them responsible. I think she\u2019ll do well at foreign relations. I think she\u2019ll choose capable but moderate supreme court justices, and I hope that Congress will approve them. This has been a miserable campaign, not just because of the poor field of candidates and the disgusting rhetoric, but also because it has divided the citizenry in very ugly ways. I am voting early, by mail, and I look forward to having the whole thing finished.</p> <h2><br></h2>",

Paying nightly fees for hotels, she couldn\u2019t save enough money for a deposit on a new apartment, and the many challenges of homelessness made it impossible for her to have a steady job. </p> <p>\u201cWe had to start all over again,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Todd Rothbard, Rosetti\u2019s attorney who handled the three cases, said management was \u201cpatient\u201d with those tenants, gave them opportunities to pay owed rent and granted their requests for additional time before they were forced to move out.</p> <p>In Williams\u2019s case, Rosetti claimed the mother was given multiple warnings and had missed several rent payments, though court filings show she was only behind by one month when his company moved to evict her.</p> <p>It\u2019s difficult to know how many of Rosetti\u2019s eviction cases end in displacement. The mapping project also analyzed court records and found that over the past 10 years, Rosetti has been associated with hundreds of eviction lawsuits (the next step after filing a notice). </p> <p>Many of the thousands of rent board notices from Rosetti may not have resulted in formal eviction cases in court. But activists note that in general there are numerous ways in which tenants are pushed out without lawsuits.</p> <p>Some may leave when they get a notice in an effort to avoid having an eviction on their record, some may not know their rights, and some may face harassment from managers, advocates said.</p> <h2>\u2018Pretty much industry standard\u2019</h2> <p>Rosetti and his lawyer strongly disputed allegations that he is a major evictor, arguing that the three-day notices are standard filings when tenants fall behind, and that his companies work with tenants to help them stay.

Because the Netherlands has a mega Moroccan problem,\u201d the statement said.</p> <p>The charges relate to an evening in March 2014 when Wilders\u2019s party narrowly failed to become the largest group on the city council in The Hague. Wilders asked a room packed with supporters and activists if they wanted to have \u201cmore or fewer Moroccans\u201d in the country.

His party\u2019s draft manifesto includes pledges to shut every mosque \u2013 previously Wilders merely opposed building new ones. It also calls for a ban on the Koran and headscarves from government buildings, the tearing up of the Schengen open borders agreement and a \u201cNexit\u201d referendum to follow the UK out of the European Union.</p> <p>Wilders has dismissed repeated calls to withdraw or apologise for his remarks, which have made his party a pariah in Dutch politics.

There is a history of antagonism between the two men: Rutte\u2019s first government, in 2010, was a minority administration propped up by a post-election pact with the PVV, but collapsed after 18 months when Wilders refused to back a \u20ac14bn austerity package.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/23/munich-violence-rocks-europe-politics\">Violence rocks political foundations of fractured, fearful Europe</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Under the Dutch proportional representation system, the leader of the largest party is conventionally given the first shot at forming a government.

If change is only explicable in the rear-view mirror, how can we accurately envision the future changes we seek, let alone achieve them? How can we be sure our proposals will make things better, and not fall victim to unintended consequences? People employ many concepts to grapple with such questions. I find \u201csystems\u201d and \u201ccomplexity\u201d two of the most helpful. </p> <p>A \u201csystem\u201d is an interconnected set of elements coherently organised in a way that achieves something. It is more than the sum of its parts: a body is more than an aggregate of individual cells; a university is not merely an agglomeration of individual students, professors, and buildings; an ecosystem is not just a set of individual plants and animals. <br></p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The neat narrative sequence of cause and effect I\u2019ve just written, of course, is only possible in hindsight.</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>A defining property of human systems is complexity: because of the sheer number of relationships and feedback loops among their many elements, they cannot be reduced to simple chains of cause and effect. Think of a crowd on a city street, or a flock of starlings wheeling in the sky at dusk. Even with supercomputers, it is impossible to predict the movement of any given person or starling, but there is order; amazingly few collisions occur even on the most crowded streets. </p> <p>In complex systems, change results from the interplay of many diverse and apparently unrelated factors. Those of us engaged in seeking change need to identify which elements are important and understand how they interact. </p> <p>My interest in systems thinking began when collecting stories for my book From Poverty to Power. The light-bulb moment came on a visit to India\u2019s Bundelkhand region, where the poor fishing communities of Tikamgarh had won rights to more than 150 large ponds. In that struggle numerous factors interacted to create change. First, a technological shift triggered changes in behaviour: the introduction of new varieties of fish, which made the ponds more profitable, induced landlords to seize ponds that had been communal. Conflict then built pressure for government action: a group of 12 brave young fishers in one village fought back, prompting a series of violent clashes that radicalized and inspired other communities; women\u2019s groups were organized for the first time, taking control of nine ponds. Enlightened politicians and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) helped pass new laws and the police amazed everyone by enforcing them. <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c2e2d247402d83ca72060c258c43d5e1ce46c7a1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c2e2d247402d83ca72060c258c43d5e1ce46c7a1/0_0_2200_1668/1000.jpg\" alt=\"East and West German citizens climbing the Berlin wall at the Brandenburg gate in Berlin on November 9, 1989.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"758\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">East and West German citizens climb the Berlin Wall at the Brandenburg gate on 9 November 1989.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The fishing communities were the real heroes of the story. They tenaciously faced down a violent campaign of intimidation, moved from direct action to advocacy, and ended up winning not only access to the ponds but a series of legal and policy changes that benefited all fishing families. </p> <p>The neat narrative sequence of cause and effect I\u2019ve just written, of course, is only possible in hindsight. In the thick of the action, no-one could have said why the various actors acted as they did, or what transformed the relative power of each. Tikamgarh\u2019s experience highlights how unpredictable is the interaction between structures (such as state institutions), agency (by communities and individuals), and the broader context (characterized by shifts in technology, environment, demography, or norms). </p> <p>Unfortunately, the way we commonly think about change projects onto the future the neat narratives we draw from the past. Many of the mental models we use are linear plans \u2013 \u201cif A, then B\u201d \u2013 with profound consequences in terms of failure, frustration, and missed opportunities. As Mike Tyson memorably said, \u201cEveryone has a plan \u2019til they get punched in the mouth\u201d. </p> <p>Let me illustrate with a metaphor. Baking a cake is a linear \u201csimple\u201d system. All I need do is find a recipe, buy the ingredients, make sure the oven is working, mix, bake, et voila! Some cakes are better than others (mine wouldn\u2019t win any prizes), but the basic approach is fixed, replicable, and reasonably reliable. However bad your cake, you\u2019ll probably be able to eat it. </p> <p>The trouble is that real life rarely bakes like a cake. Engaging a complex system is more like raising a child. What fate would await your new baby if you decided to go linear and design a project plan setting out activities, assumptions, outputs, and outcomes for the next twenty years and then blindly followed it? Nothing good, probably. <br></p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>As Mike Tyson memorably said, \u2018Everyone has a plan 'til they get punched in the mouth\u2019</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Instead, parents make it up as they go along. And so they should. Raising a child is iterative, an endless testing of assumptions about right and wrong, a constant adaptation to the evolving nature of the child and his or her relationship with their parents and others. Despite all the \u201cbest practice\u201d guides preying on the insecurity of new parents, child-rearing is devoid of any \u201cright way\u201d of doing things. What really helps parents is experience (the second kid is usually easier), and the advice and reassurance of people who\u2019ve been through it themselves \u2013 \u201cmentoring\u201d in management speak. Working in complex systems requires the same kind of iterative, collaborative, and flexible approach. Deng Xiaoping\u2019s recipe for China\u2019s take off epitomises this approach: \u201cWe will cross the river by feeling the stones under our feet, one by one\u201d. <br></p> <p>Systems are in a state of constant change. Jean Boulton, one of the authors of Embracing Complexity, likes to use the metaphor of the forest, which typically goes through cycles of growth, collapse, regeneration, and new growth. In the early part of the cycle\u2019s growth phase, the number of species and of individual plants and animals increases quickly, as organisms arrive to exploit all available ecological niches. The forest\u2019s components become more linked to one another, enhancing the ecosystem\u2019s \u201cconnectedness\u201d and multiplying the ways the forest regulates itself and maintains its stability. However, the forest\u2019s very connectedness and efficiency eventually reduce its capacity to cope with severe outside shocks, paving the way for a collapse and eventual regeneration. Jean argues that activists need to adapt their analysis and strategy according to the stage that their political surroundings most closely resemble: growth, maturity, locked-in but fragile, or collapsing. <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"29abb686f68701cdb8e1768c54321d985439782b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/29abb686f68701cdb8e1768c54321d985439782b/0_169_2847_1709/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Harold Macmillan, then UK prime minister, with president John F.

Similarly, my experience of activism has obliged me to question linear approaches to campaigning, for example, as I hesitantly embraced the realisation that change doesn\u2019t happen like that. </p> <p>Once I began thinking about systems, I started to see complexity and unpredictable \u201cemergent change\u201d everywhere \u2013 in politics, economics, at work, and even in the lives of those around me. </p> <h2><strong>Crises as critical junctures </strong></h2> <p>Change in complex systems occurs in slow, steady processes such as demographic shifts and in sudden, unforeseeable jumps. Nothing seems to change until suddenly it does, a stop\u2013start rhythm that can confound activists. When British Prime Minister Harold Macmillan was asked what he most feared in politics, he reportedly replied in his wonderfully patrician style, \u201cEvents, dear boy\u201d. Such \u201cevents\u201d that disrupt social, political, or economic relations are not just a prime ministerial headache. They can open the door to previously unthinkable reforms. <br></p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Working in complex systems requires the same kind of iterative, collaborative, and flexible approach as raising a child</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Such \u201ccritical junctures\u201d, as the economists Daron Acemoglu and James A Robinson call them, force political leaders to question their long-held assumptions about what constitutes \u201csound\u201d policies, and make them more willing to take the risks associated with innovation, as the status quo suddenly appears less worth defending. </p> <p>Much of the institutional framework we take for granted today was born of the trauma of the Great Depression and the second world war. The disastrous failures of policy that led to these twin catastrophes profoundly affected the thinking of political and economic leaders across the world, triggering a vastly expanded role for government in managing the economy and addressing social ills, as well as precipitating the decolonisation of large parts of the globe. </p> <p>Similarly, in the 1970s the sharp rise in oil prices (and consequent economic stagnation and runaway inflation) marked the end of the post-war \u201cGolden Age\u201d and gave rise to a turn away from government regulation and to the idealisation of the \u201cfree market\u201d. In communist systems, at different moments, political and economic upheaval paved the way for radical economic shifts in China and Vietnam. <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e1560bc886c3edb8373156e9272841ab0bd11002\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e1560bc886c3edb8373156e9272841ab0bd11002/0_0_2220_1524/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ed Goswick removes mud from the entrance of the Gorenflo Elementary School in Gulfport, Miss., on Friday, Sept. 9, 2005.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"686\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ed Goswick removes mud from the entrance of the Gorenflo Elementary School after Hurricane Katrina in 2005.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Darron Cummings/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Milton Friedman, the father of monetarist economics, wrote: \u201cOnly a crisis \u2013 actual or perceived \u2013 produces real change. When that crisis occurs, the actions that are taken depend on the ideas that are lying around. That, I believe, is our basic function: to develop alternatives to existing policies, to keep them alive and available until the politically impossible becomes politically inevitable.\u201d </p> <p>Naomi Klein, in her 2007 book The Shock Doctrine, argues that the right has used shocks much better than the left, especially in recent decades. Klein cites the example of how proponents of private education in the US managed to turn Hurricane Katrina to their advantage: \u201cWithin 19 months, New Orleans\u2019 public school system had been almost completely replaced by privately-run charter schools.\u201d According to the American Enterprise Institute, \u201cKatrina accomplished in a day what Louisiana school reformers couldn\u2019t do after years of trying.\u201d <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"408600ee309fb6e557f6b2b7ecea8a937efeeace\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/408600ee309fb6e557f6b2b7ecea8a937efeeace/0_133_4000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An Egyptian boy flashes a Victory sign during a protest in central Cairo, Egypt, 29 June 2011.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An Egyptian boy flashes a victory sign during a protest in Cairo in June 2011.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mohamed Omar/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>NGOs are not always so nimble in spotting and seizing such opportunities. Three months into the 2011 Egyptian revolution, I attended a meeting of Oxfam International\u2019s chief executive officers (CEOs), at which they spent hours debating whether the uprising in Tahrir Square was likely to lead to a humanitarian crisis. Only then did the penny drop that the protests, upheaval, and overthrow of an oppressive regime were also a huge potential opportunity, at which point the assembled bosses showed admirable speed in allocating budgets for supporting civil society activists in Egypt, and backing it up with advocacy at the Arab League and elsewhere. But by then valuable time had passed; soon the optimism of revolution gave way to the violence and misery of repression. </p> <p>Some progressive activists engaged in policy advocacy are better attuned to Friedman\u2019s lesson. Within weeks of the appalling Rana Plaza factory collapse in Bangladesh that killed more than 1,100 people in April 2013 an international \u201cAccord on Fire and Building Safety in Bangladesh\u201d was signed and delivered. A five-year legally binding agreement between global companies, retailers, and trade unions, the accord mandates some astounding breakthroughs: an independent inspection programme supported by the brand-name companies and involving workers and trade unions; the public disclosure of all factories, inspection reports, and corrective action plans; a commitment by signatory brands to fund improvements and maintain sourcing relationships; democratically elected health and safety committees in all factories; and worker empowerment through an extensive training programme, complaints mechanism, and the right to refuse unsafe work. <br></p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Only a crisis \u2013 actual or perceived \u2013 produces real change</p> <footer> <cite>Milton Friedman</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In hindsight, we can point to several factors to explain how this grisly \u201cshock as opportunity\u201d drove rapid movement toward better regulation: </p> <ul> <li>A forum on labour rights in Bangladesh (the Ethical Trading Initiative) had already built a high degree of trust between traditional antagonists (companies, unions, and NGOs). Trust allowed people to get on the phone to each other right away. </li> <li>Prior work, underway since 2011, had sketched the outline of a potential accord; the Rana Plaza disaster massively escalated the pressure to act on it. </li> <li>A nascent national process (the National Action Plan for Fire Safety) gave outsiders something to support and build on. </li> <li>Energetic leadership from two new international trade unions (IndustriALL and UNI Global Union) helped get the right people in the room. Perhaps we should add to Friedman\u2019s instruction \u201cto keep alternatives alive and available\u201d: progressive activists also need to build trust and connections among the key individuals who could implement the desired change. I am not suggesting that activists become ambulance chasers, jumping on every crisis to make their point. Rather, we must understand the windows of opportunity provided by \u201cevents, dear boy\u201d as critical junctures when our long-term work creating constituencies for change, transforming attitudes and norms, and so on can suddenly come to fruition.</li> </ul> <p></p> <p></p> <h2><strong>Positive deviance </strong></h2> <p>One of the most exciting alternatives to business as usual goes by the name of \u201cpositive deviance\u201d. </p> <p>In December 1991, Jerry and Monique Sternin arrived in Vietnam to work for Save the Children in four communities with children aged under three, most of whom were malnourished. The Sternins asked teams of volunteers to observe in homes where children were poor but well-fed. In every case they found that the mother or father was collecting a number of tiny shrimps, crabs, or snails \u2013 making for a portion \u201cthe size of one joint of one finger\u201d \u2013 from the rice paddies and adding these to the child\u2019s diet. <br></p> <p>These \u201cpositive deviant\u201d families also instructed the home babysitter to feed the child four or even five times a day, in contrast to most families who fed young children only before parents headed to the rice fields early in the morning and in the late afternoon after returning from a working day. Results were shared on a board in the town hall, and the charts quickly became a focus of attention and buzz. By the end of the first year, 80 per cent of the children in the programme were fully rehabilitated. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"34bc22b1fb27c69ff37054da8aa59e2cf0b58403\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/34bc22b1fb27c69ff37054da8aa59e2cf0b58403/0_0_6202_4134/1000.jpg\" alt=\"In 2013 more than 300 workers were killed when the Rana Plaza building in Bangladesh collapsed.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">In 2013 more than 1,100 workers were killed when the Rana Plaza building in Bangladesh collapsed.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Biraj/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In their book, The Power of Positive Deviance, the Sternins, with Richard Pascale, describe how the approach was subsequently applied in 50 countries to everything from decreasing gang violence in inner city New Jersey to reducing sex-trafficking of girls in rural Indonesia. The starting point is to \u201clook for outliers who succeed against the odds\u201d. But who is doing the looking also matters. If external \u201cexperts\u201d investigate the outliers and turn the results into a toolkit, little will come of it. When communities make the discovery for themselves, behavioural change can take root \u2013 providing what the authors call \u201csocial proof\u201d. <br></p> <p>Positive deviance capitalises on a hugely energising fact: for any given problem, someone in the community will have already identified a solution. It focuses on people\u2019s assets and knowledge, rather than their lacks and problems. The Sternins recount their experience in Misiones Province, Argentina, where dropout rates were awful. Teachers and principals were hostile to criticism and put the blame on the parents. All that started to change when facilitators asked the \u201csomersault question\u201d: why were dropout rates much lower in some schools? Teachers then agreed to ask the parents at those schools, who rapidly identified teacher attitudes toward parents as the key. The positive deviant teachers were negotiating informal annual \u201clearning contracts\u201d with parents. When many teachers adopted that approach, dropout rates in test schools fell by 50%. </p> <p>Despite its success, positive deviance remains an outlier in the aid business. The \u201cstandard model\u201d of identifying gaps, devising initiatives to fill them, and disseminating the guidance is incredibly hard to budge. Perhaps not surprisingly, experts are often part of the problem. The Sternins write: \u201cThose eking out existence on the margins of society grasp the simple elegance of the PD approach \u2013 in contrast to the sceptical consideration of the more educated and/or privileged. Uptake seems in inverse proportion to prosperity, formal authority, years of schooling and degrees hanging on walls.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Positive deviance sees that for any problem, someone in the community will have already identified a solution</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I can vouch from personal experience how hard it is to give up my learned role and become a facilitator. Holding back from providing your own answer when you ask a group a question is, as the Sternins put it, \u201cmore difficult than trying to stifle an oncoming sneeze\u201d. </p> <h2><strong>Thinking in systems should change everything</strong><br></h2> <p>In the first film in the Matrix series (the only one worth watching), the hero, Neo, suddenly starts to see the matrix of ones and zeroes that lies beneath the surface of his world, at which point he becomes invincible. I have the same feeling about systems (aside from the invincibility part). Thinking in systems should change everything, including the way we look at politics, economics, society, and even ourselves, in new and exciting ways. <br></p> <p>It also poses a devastating challenge to traditional linear planning approaches and to our ways of working. We activists need to become better \u201creflectivists\u201d, taking the time to understand the system before (and while) engaging with it. We need to better understand the stop\u2013start rhythm of change exhibited by complex systems and adapt our efforts accordingly. And we need to become less arrogant, more willing to learn from accidents, from failures, and from other people. Finally, we have to make friends with ambiguity and uncertainty, while maintaining the energy and determination so essential to changing the world. </p> <p>It isn\u2019t easy, but it is entirely possible, as I hope I have shown. Once we learn to \u201cdance with the system\u201d, no other partner will do. </p> <p><em>\u2018<a href=\"http://how-change-happens.com/\">How change happens</a>\u2019 by Duncan Green is published by Oxford University Press. </em></p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/global-development\">Join our community</a></strong><strong> of development professionals and humanitarians.

Why do I have to be a trailblazer too? | Lucy Webster</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Sounds great. So why was I disturbed? I talked to friends at length about the ads, on social media, face to face \u2013 and it was quickly apparent I had dropped a very hot potato into the disability activism lap.</p> <p>There are three advertisements. In the cheekiest one, a disabled woman (actor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2013/sep/30/disabled-students-university-drama-departments\" title=\"\">Storme Toolis</a>) is joking with friends about her spasms, intimating that her boyfriend \u201cisn\u2019t complaining\u201d, and ejaculates over her as a result. In another, a chirpy young woman (Samantha Renke) makes a joke about running over the bride\u2019s foot, but getting \u201cthe best man\u2019s number\u201d. The third features a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/sep/08/deaf-actor-theatre-roles\" title=\"\">deaf actor (Genevieve Barr)</a> and British Sign Language, in a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/sep/06/channel-4-first-sign-language-only-tv-ad-paralympic-games\" title=\"\">skit about a dog eating a hearing aid</a>, demonstrated by munching on Maltesers \u2013 obviously.</p> <p>First, without restraint, a big cheer for the actors. Disabled actors \u2013 they exist after all. And are doing a great job here. Three all at once in an ad campaign, coming along just like buses. Out in the shiny mainstream world, <a href=\"http://metro.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Metro</a> positively drools and declares the ad has been \u201cwidely lauded\u201d, and quotes a viewer from Twitter: \u201cBest Maltesers advert ever!!\u201d. On the <a href=\"https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=YgUqmKQ9Lrg\" title=\"\">Maltesers YouTube page</a>, the comments range from hilarious, to worried, to downright weird \u2013 perhaps presenting a grim equality of sorts.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgUqmKQ9Lrg\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/YgUqmKQ9Lrg?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgUqmKQ9Lrg&amp;app=desktop\">One of the Maltesers ads</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>What these adverts also do is highlight an interesting truth; most disabled activists and academics can spot from a wheelchair-mile away when something is made to educate others \u2013 ie the non-disabled \u2013 rather than to present us inclusively as three-dimensional human beings.</p> <p>It\u2019s bound to get messy. It\u2019s about selling a chocolate product after all \u2013 and is it really worth some of us feeling unhappy? It does grate on me given that the advertising industry is part of the capitalist agenda. And sadly, featuring a few disabled actors in an advert isn\u2019t really likely to be a major skirmish in its downfall. Nor is it likely to explode barriers and negative attitudes. Or is it?</p> <p>Lisa Hammond, who plays <a href=\"http://eastenders.wikia.com/wiki/Donna_Yates\" title=\"\">Donna Yates in EastEnders</a>, said: \u201cAll of the actors in the ads are great \u2026 that they are all women makes me happy. The issue is the fact that every one of the adverts\u2019 focus is impairment, as part of the story. We\u2019ve been banging on about this for years \u2013 feels like we are in a perpetual loop!

The charity and disabled activists do not by and large have a happy relationship. This highlights a situation that cleaves many of us apart: Scope is not user-led; disabled people do not control or have ownership of it. These ads make that abundantly clear.</p> <p>But along with my friend the broadcaster/writer <a href=\"http://mikscarlet.com\" title=\"\">Mik Scarlet</a>, I can be pragmatic: \u201cI was part of the focus group [for the ads] and found that some of the stories were taken but not portrayed exactly. This led to the cringey stuff. But disabled people in ads? Big turning point, they mark a historic point.\u201d</p> <p>Most responses settle here: tried hard, not perfect, we want more. A begrudging sense of this being better than nothing. I know that until disabled creatives are allowed into the fold, all the way up to writing scripts for adverts, change will be slow.</p>",
  "<h2>Russia</h2> <p>Russia has played an unexpectedly prominent role in this year\u2019s US election, although the extent of the Kremlin\u2019s involvement in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/16/putin-russia-us-democrats-hacking-cyber-attacks\">hacking Democratic servers</a> and the WikiLeaks disclosures will probably never be known. </p> <p>What is clear is that Moscow has enjoyed making trouble.

If we get attacked, Japan doesn\u2019t have to help us,\u201d he said. \u201cSomehow, that doesn\u2019t sound so fair.\u201d</p> <p>Trump\u2019s frequent claim that Japan is taking advantage of US largesse is inaccurate. Tokyo contributes \u00a5192bn ($1.84bn) a year towards maintaining the US military presence. US bases in Japan cost about $5.5bn a year, according to the Pentagon, about half of which goes on salaries and other personnel costs.</p> <p>South Korea, meanwhile, contributes $850m a year \u2013 about half the cost of maintaining 28,500 troops on the southern side of the heavily fortified border that divides the Korean peninsula.</p> <p>Yet Trump has returned to the theme throughout the campaign: \u201cAs far as Japan and other countries, we are being ripped off by everybody in the world,\u201d he said at an event in Las Vegas. \u201cWe\u2019re defending other countries, we\u2019re spending a fortune doing it.

The perpetrator, Omar Mateen, was of Afghan origin, and Trump\u2019s explicit linking of Afghans to terrorism earned him widespread contempt.<br></p> <p>Afghans in general seem unsure of what either candidate has in store for their country, apart from two indications from the Trump campaign: his proposed ban on Muslims from entering America; and his calls to pull American troops home, or at least limit their role in Afghanistan, which would likely have a destabilising effect on the country. Neither is popular with Afghans.<br></p> <p>Recently, though, Afghans have mostly treated the US elections with a certain sarcastic distance. After the third presidential debate, Trump\u2019s refusal to accept the election results if he did not win led to a wave of snarky commentary on social media. Some suggested that perhaps the Afghan president, Ashraf Ghani, would need to fly to Washington to broker a national unity government deal, as the US secretary of state, John Kerry, did after the divisive 2014 Afghan election.<br></p> <p><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/sune-engel-rasmussen\">Sune Engel Rasmussen</a> in Kabul</em></p> <h2>Germany </h2> <p>If Hillary Clinton were to run against Donald Trump for the German presidency, she would win by a landslide.

In La Repubblica, the columnist Vittorio Zucconi said that, notwithstanding the obvious similarities between the two men \u2013 their hair, their treatment of women as sexual objects, their alleged avoidance of tax \u2013 both had captured the hearts of a certain class of voters who hate the political establishment. Among these voters, stories about the candidates\u2019 foibles did nothing to dent their popularity. Both could only be brought down by their own self-destructive tendencies, Zucconi concluded.</p> <p>Gianni Riotta, the former editor of Il Sole 24 Ore, said that \u2013 despite being a \u201cdisastrous\u201d prime minister \u2013 Berlusconi was a more astute politician than Trump has proven to be, having counted both George W Bush and Vladimir Putin as friends. Berlusconi \u2013 a confirmed billionaire with vast media holdings \u2013 was also a better businessman, Riotta said.</p> <p>In Italy, the race for the White House is almost always interpreted through the lens of the country\u2019s own fractured political landscape, and Italy\u2019s political leaders have not shied away from choosing sides.

Increasingly Clinton may find herself needing to choose between Britain and Europe, something that will make the Foreign Office distinctly queasy.</p> <p>Foreign secretary Boris Johnson has already been manoeuvring to show his personal support for a more muscular Syrian policy in line with Clinton\u2019s own long-stated support for a no-fly zone. Britain will also be at the front of the queue if she chooses to take a more assertive line with Putin. At present, Britain has been the rhetorical outrider, but it may get some practical backing from the White House.

In truth, the remarks were part of a positive assessment of his opponents but it is tempting to see such an accidental indiscretion as an example of the 35-year-old\u2019s inexperience.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/football-league-blog/2016/oct/29/football-league-your-thoughts-fulham-hit-five-to-hand-huddersfield-reality-check\">Football League your thoughts: Derby extend home run as Newcastle win again</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Naivety was apparent in his side, too. It might be an odd quality to ascribe to a team that contained six current internationals, but the dominant characteristic of Norwich\u2019s performance was the frequency with which they made elementary unforced errors. The opening goal came about after the goalkeeper, Michael McGovern, took a terrible touch instead of simply clearing his lines. Murray closed him down, barged him off the ball and finished coolly. The fourth goal came after the centre-half Ryan Bennett attempted a clearance which simply squirmed off his foot. Murray took advantage again and fired a shot straight through McGovern. The fifth was the worst of the lot, though, as Bennett\u2019s partner, Timm Klose, decided to charge up the pitch through a crowd of players, pirouetting on the ball as he went. His audacity was met by a sound tackle and within seconds Anthony Knockaert\u2019s deft dink hit the net.</p> <p>Hughton\u2019s safety-first approach never won over the Norwich faithful despite it keeping them in the Premier League. Neil has put the emphasis on offence and would rather win a match 3-2 than 1-0. It is in this context that Norwich\u2019s errors can be understood as a desperate attempt to play positively at all costs. But it certainly seems that a dose of pragmatism might sometimes be a better option.</p> <p>The Carrow Road club stick with their managers. They sacked Hughton with only five games remaining of the 2013-14 season that ended in relegation and they will probably back Neil. But an inability to keep clean sheets \u2013 only one so far this season \u2013 is putting real pressure on the team. Meanwhile Chris Hughton\u2019s old\u2011fashioned virtues keep Brighton moving forwards.</p> <h2>Talking points</h2> <p>In reinforcing his point that the Championship does not allow for complacency, Chris Hughton reeled off teams he thought would push his Brighton side for promotion. The list included Newcastle United, Aston Villa, Derby County, Birmingham City and Huddersfield Town. Perhaps another candidate should be Slavisa Jokanovic\u2019s Fulham, who played David Wagner\u2019s early season leaders this weekend and claimed their own 5-0 victory.</p> <p>Fulham began the season well, taking 11 points from 15 in August, including an opening-day victory against Newcastle. But September was as bad as August was good, with no wins and a 4-0 home defeat at the hands of Bristol City. In the past month the ship has been steadied. A 4-2 away win at Barnsley at the start of October has sparked a distinct upturn in form. The Cottagers came back from 2-0 down to draw with Norwich City, lost unfortunately against Aston Villa away and have now laid down a marker against the pacesetters.</p> <p>As was the case with his Watford side, who won promotion in 2015, Jokanovic has crafted a blend of steel and style. Kevin McDonald and Stefan Johansen, a summer signing from Celtic, provide a powerful base for the creative talents of Sone Aluko and Lucas Piazon to play. But it is the return to form of Chris Martin that has led to the Cottagers climbing the table. His loan move from Derby was one of the summer\u2019s stranger transfers as, on his day, the 27-year-old is one of the best strikers in the division. He scored a brace on Saturday, his second in three games.</p> <p>The usual disclaimers apply, but Fulham have a capable squad and room for growth. \u201cThe job is not done,\u201d Jokanovic said after the rout on Saturday. \u201cWe need to build on our confidence and philosophy. But we are in a learning process and beginning to build some kind of identity.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 Last week they parted company with Karl Robinson after six years, and now MK Dons are looking for a new manager. Sitting just above the League One relegation spots with 16 points, the Dons lost 2-1 at Sheffield United on Saturday. The result was no great surprise as the fourth-placed Blades extended their unbeaten run to 11 matches. But it seems unlikely that caretaker Richie Barker is a serious candidate for the job full time.</p> <p>More likely appears a continuation of the Dons\u2019 reputation for giving young managers their break. Robinson got the job at 29 years of age and followed Roberto Di Matteo and Paul Ince in starting his career at the club. Now rumours suggest that Ryan Giggs might be considered for the role.</p> <p>The hottest managerial property who has never managed, Giggs missed out on the Swansea job to Bob Bradley this month and recently ruled himself out of the vacancy at the Championship strugglers Wigan Athletic. But reports suggest the Dons owner Pete Winkelman wants to ascertain Giggs\u2019s availability before making any decisions on his next manager. Another, equally intriguing, name mentioned in dispatches is that of Paul Mitchell, the former head of recruitment at Southampton and Tottenham Hotspur. Mitchell turned out 59 times for the Dons midfield during a four-year spell at the club.</p> <p>\u2022 In League Two, Plymouth Argyle are sitting pretty. Top of the table with 35 points from 15 matches, the Pilgrims are unbeaten since the second game of the season, an away reverse against their nearest challengers Carlisle. Before Saturday\u2019s match against Colchester, the striker Jordan Slew revealed what he thought was the secret to their success and the answer was simple: fitness. \u201cWe\u2019re a strong team who are very fit and I think most other teams can\u2019t handle that,\u201d Slew told the Plymouth Herald. \u201cThat\u2019s the beauty of it. We know that, come the last 20 minutes, we\u2019ll be stronger and that we can get a goal any time. So we\u2019re a very dangerous team right now and a lot of other teams in the division will fear us.\u201d</p> <p>Slew\u2019s views are borne out by statistics. Before Saturday Argyle had scored seven goals in the last 20 minutes of matches, nearly a third of their total in the league. And on Saturday they did it again. With the match level at 1-1 and three minutes remaining on the clock, Ryan Donaldson had the energy to charge down Colchester keeper Sam Walker whose clearance smashed into the midfielder and looped back into the net. Plymouth held on to claim all three points. \u201cThe closer I got to him I thought \u2019this might hit me\u2019,\u201d Donaldson said of his goal afterwards. But he went on to confess: \u201cWhere it hit me I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>The trappings of inherited wealth and privilege, alongside the invisible, but strictly defined codes of the British class system, have long provided fertile raw material for photographers. The aristocratic Cecil Beaton and the unquestioning <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/sep/25/slim-aarons-women-photography-fantasy-lifestyles-of-the-rich-and-famous\" title=\"\">Slim Aarons</a> both, in their differing ways, made great wealth seem synonymous with good taste, while Martin Parr has often accentuated the vulgarity of the new super-rich in close up and in vivid colour.</p> <p>With <em>Gentlemen</em>, which is as knowing and playfully political as its title suggests, Karen Knorr offers a different kind of questioning gaze, more artfully constructed and quietly thought-provoking. The series is a conceptual companion piece to <em>Belgravia</em>, published last year, in which Knorr evoked \u201cthe everyday of a privileged minority\u201d in one of London\u2019s most exclusive districts through images made between 1979 and 1981.</p> <p>For <em>Gentlemen</em>, she gained access to the various gentlemen\u2019s clubs in central London between 1981 and 1983, to delve even deeper into the rituals of the English establishment elite. Her quiet portraits and interiors are accompanied by texts that reflect \u2013 and parody \u2013 the language of power, privilege and patriarchy.</p> <p>Thus, a portrait of a besuited man standing as if lost in reverie on the marble bust-lined balcony of his club is accompanied by the words: \u201cWhatever a man\u2019s social origin, once he has been elected, he is looked upon as an equal by his fellow members.\u201d This statement could apply, with equal banality, to Eton or the House of Lords. It is, as Knorr suggests, the self-serving language of the public school and the Conservative elite.</p> <p>It is this conceptually driven play of image and words that makes <em>Gentlemen</em> such a mischievous meditation on the sanctity \u2013 and absurdity \u2013 of these male institutions and the people that inhabit them. The portraits and the texts are not what they initially seem, the former being art-directed by Knorr to be both \u201cnatural\u201d and revealing, the latter being constructed from parliamentary speeches of the time, as well as quotations from contemporary news reports. The end result is a kind of visual and linguistic mimicry that echoes, sometimes directly, sometimes obliquely, the language, values and beliefs of the English aristocracy. Among them is the belief in primogeniture \u2013 the right by law of the firstborn son rather than daughter to inherit the parent\u2019s estate. Being born male, then, is, as Knorr suggests, the first privilege from which all others flow.</p> <p>Intriguingly, the images in <em>Gentlemen</em> were made when Margaret Thatcher was prime minister. Despite her being granted honorary membership of the Conservative gentlemen\u2019s club, the Carlton, such institutions remain very much a male milieu. Throughout, Knorr captures the sense of entitlement that these institutions insist on and perpetuate as well as the vague aura of absurdity that attends their continued existence. Though much progress has been made in terms of gender equality since she first made this work more than 30 years ago, the gentlemen\u2019s clubs endure in their intransigence, as does their behind-the-scenes influence on politics and business.</p> <p>\u201cWhilst women now have full property rights,\u201d writes Knorr on her website, \u201cthey still remain under-represented in key positions of governance and in financial and academic worlds. It is still a boys\u2019 club in which some women are honorary members.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"http://stanleybarker.co.uk/books/gentlemen/\" title=\"\"><em>Gentlemen is available to buy (\u00a340 plus p&amp;p) at stanleybarker.co.uk</em></a></p>",

  "<p>It is obviously more than a game and this documentary directed by Kief Davidson and Richard Ladkani \u2013 and exec-produced by Leonardo DiCaprio \u2013 showing on Netflix, brings a new urgency to an old subject: the ivory trade, which is threatening the world\u2019s elephants. This threat has not been cancelled or brought under control, as I had assumed. The film persuasively argues that it is all but out of control: so much so that elephants are in danger of being wiped out in the wild in just a matter of years. One of the biggest mammals on Earth might vanish. And the market forces driving the trade stem from just one country: China, where there is a huge appetite for luxury goods made of ivory. Well-organised criminal gangs poach the elephants, and get the ivory in container ships to China via south east Asia: the Vietnamese connection.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/27/world-on-track-to-lose-two-thirds-of-wild-animals-by-2020-major-report-warns\">World on track to lose two-thirds of wild animals by 2020, major report warns</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In the most grisly way, the well-publicised extinction threat and outrage are themselves creating the luxury cachet and driving up the price, encouraging the market which in turn worsens the danger still further. With elephants in such dire straits, competing poachers and illicit buyers know not just that they can make a fortune, but that there is only a short period of time in which to do it. The price rises all the time, and the window of opportunity is closing as well. They are in an extinction race to the bottom. And if elephants disappear in the wild, these same market forces in luxury goods mean that other species will be in danger too: the rhino, the giraffe, the lion. We are wearing down the fabric of biodiversity.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"174aeab4f7d05459a51eb0be072096a429ad880d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/174aeab4f7d05459a51eb0be072096a429ad880d/163_0_1000_600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Ivory Game film still\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>The awful truth appears to be that the Chinese government has legitimised and stimulated this trade by creating a notional legal \u201callowance\u201d for domestic consumption of ivory, which naturally only encourages the black marketers to use this supposed legality to launder their mountains of illicit material. Any artefact, any brutally severed tusk, can always be claimed to come under the \u201clegal\u201d umbrella. An anti-poaching campaigner says: \u201cOne person holds in his hands the fate of elephants: the president of China. I think it is the first time in history that one person has in his hands the destiny of an entire species.\u201d An observer is entitled to wonder if this situation is being helped by any possible state corruption in Africa. Investigating that isn\u2019t the point of the film. But China\u2019s huge semi-legalised ivory hunger is certainly the driving force.</p> <p>The film is perhaps a little too excitable and enamoured of its own narc-thriller style, with mannerisms that reminded me of Paul Greengrass or Michael Mann: particularly the scenes of Swat-type attacks and dramatic overhead shots of cars moving swiftly across open country. After a while, I felt that any time the film spends not demanding to speak to the Chinese president is a waste of time. But maybe the more realistic solution is not to focus on China, but on stronger protective action on the supply side, in Africa. In any event: a committed, valuable film.</p> <p>\u2022 The Ivory Game premieres on Netflix on 4 November.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GPEKKaSmZY\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/3GPEKKaSmZY?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GPEKKaSmZY\">Watch the trailer for The Ivory Game \u2013 video</a></figcaption> </figure>",
  "<p>The perfect illustration of the NFL wallowing in their own ratings decline could be seen as the Oakland Raiders set the league record for penalties on Sunday and still won. In what should have been the most exciting battle of the early-afternoon \u2013 a wild montage of huge catches, flying tackles and drama that trickled through nearly five quarters of football \u2013 America was treated to a endless blizzard of yellow flags.</p> <p>The Raiders beat the Tampa Bay Buccaneers 30-24 when Seth Roberts caught a Derek Carr pass, slipped through two tackles and raced to the end zone with 1:45 left in overtime. His touchdown should have been the headline of the day, giving once-hapless Oakland their fifth road win and making them, at 6-2, legitimate contenders to win the AFC West. But instead the story is less about the big win and more about the penalties.</p> <p>Oakland committed 24 penalties on Sunday, breaking the old NFL record of 22. And while the new mark deserves an asterisk, since the previous record came at a time when declined and offsetting penalties did not count against a team\u2019s total (Oakland had three penalties declined or offset on Sunday) it was still a remarkable lack of self-control for a team that leads the league with 104 penalties (86 accepted). Their 200 yards in penalties were actually more than Tampa Bay quarterback Jameis Winston had passing (180).</p> <p>It\u2019s never good for interest in a league when it seems like everyone is talking about officiating. In addition to the Raiders and their parade of flags, Panthers quarterback Cam Newton wondered if the officials <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/30/cam-newton-quarterback-hits-alex-smith-nfl\">were properly protecting quarterbacks,</a> Seattle\u2019s Richard Sherman blasted \u201cthe calls or lack thereof\u201d and Washington\u2019s Josh Norman took off after line judge Brad Freeman in the team\u2019s game in London.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/30/cam-newton-quarterback-hits-alex-smith-nfl\">'It's bull crap': Anger at quarterback hits as Cam Newton and Alex Smith suffer</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cWho is official 88?\u201d Norman said in the press conference <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/30/nfl-washington-cincinnati-delight-wembley-crowd-entertaining-tie\">after his team tied Cincinnati</a>. \u201cI\u2019ve got to know. You suck. I\u2019m just putting it out there. We play a physical game, they know that. We come here, international game, it all goes out the window. He needs to be reprimanded.\u201d</p> <p>Of course Freeman didn\u2019t allow the Bengals\u2019 AJ Green to make nine catches for 121 yards, which no doubt led to Norman\u2019s rage. But Norman has already been frustrated this year with officials who have flagged him for excessive celebration \u2013 something that is becoming a common occurrence throughout the league, making you wonder if the NFL wants fans to watch their games.</p> <h2><strong>Quote of the week</strong></h2> <p><em>\u201cThat\u2019s horse crap\u201d </em>\u2013 Cam Newton is angry. The Carolina Panthers quarterback has been hammered, clobbered, and thumped on the ground this season. He\u2019s had one concussion and should probably have been checked for others. After taking a helmet-to-helmet hit that wasn\u2019t flagged in the Panthers\u2019 win over Arizona, he looked ready to throw up his hands.</p> <p>\u201cI just can\u2019t keep accepting \u2018Oh, we missed that one,\u2019 or \u2018I apologize for doing that\u2019 or \u2018I didn\u2019t see it,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s horse crap. Coming from a person who\u2019s been fined before, coming from a person who everybody\u2019s expecting a lot from, I\u2019m still going. But yet when you constantly see the hits when you constantly see flags being picked up and flags not being thrown and see other quarterbacks getting it for lesser physical hits, it\u2019s taking the fun for me out. I\u2019m just being honest about that.\u201d</p> <p>No one was protecting Kansas City quarterback Alex Smith either. Smith was knocked to the ground twice on Sunday, and had to be checked for concussions. The first time he was announced as being questionable and yet returned to have his head bounced on the turf like a basketball. The second one knocked him out for the game.</p> <p>The league talks a lot about taking care of players, especially their quarterbacks. It\u2019s time to protect them.\u202a</p> <h2><strong>Video of the week</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/thebiglead/status/792811509411819520\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Fan at Bills Game Threw Sex Toy onto the Field as Patriots Drove for Touchdown <a href=\"https://t.co/zHpduiButX\">https://t.co/zHpduiButX</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/wz5nAga8D6\">pic.twitter.com/wz5nAga8D6</a></p>&mdash; The Big Lead (@thebiglead) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/thebiglead/status/792811509411819520\">October 30, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>The Patriots beat the Bills 38-17 and somebody threw a (presumably unused) phallic object on to the field.</p> <p>Oh, and New England\u2019s tight end Rob Gronkowski set the franchise record for touchdown catches with, um, 69. A good game for fans of puerile humor. </p> <h2><strong>Stat of the week</strong></h2> <p><strong>6,916</strong> The number of days since the last time there were ties in back-to-back weeks in the NFL. Washington and Cincinnati welcomed the day with an entertaining and \u2013 at times \u2013 well-played 27-27 deadlock (marred by four missed field goals and extra points). It came as the world was still recovering from last Sunday night\u2019s 6-6 tie between Seattle and Arizona. Ties are rare in the NFL. There have <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_NFL_tied_games\">only been 22</a> since the league added overtime before the 1974 season. In fact, only three seasons since 1974 have had more than one tie: 1986, 1997 and this season. In 1997, Philadelphia and Baltimore played to a 10-10 tie in Week 12 and Washington and the New York Giants finished 7-7 in Week 13.</p> <p>And they say the game is boring now?</p> <h2><strong>Fantasy player of the week</strong></h2> <p>Nobody mentions Oakland\u2019s Derek Carr much when they talk about the league\u2019s top quarterbacks. Part of the reason is because he plays for the Raiders. He also played his college football at Fresno State and was therefore invisible to much of the country before he arrived in the NFL. But Carr is starting to push his way into that conversation. Granted, he played nearly five quarters on Sunday but his statistical line is eye-popping: 40-for-59 for 513 yards with four touchdowns against no interceptions. Nobody else even came close this week.</p> <h2><strong>Elsewhere around the league</strong></h2> <p>-Dallas quarterback Dak Prescott kept up his early-season magic inspiring a fourth-quarter comeback from 10 points down to lead the Cowboys into overtime. Then he hit a wide-open Jason Witten for the game-winning touchdown <a href=\"http://www.nfl.com/gamecenter/2016103010/2016/REG8/eagles@cowboys\">in a 29-23 victory over the Eagles</a>.</p> <p>-Broncos defensive coordinator Wade Phillips was flattened by Melvin Gordon in Denver\u2019s 27-19 victory over San Diego, and was taken to hospital. <a href=\"http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000730574/article/wade-phillips-released-from-hospital-after-collision\">He turned out to be fine</a> as did his team. Quarterback Trevor Siemian threw for 276 yards and the Broncos intercepted the Chargers\u2019 Philip Rivers three times.</p> <p>-Texans coach Bill O\u2019Brien was yelling again. This time it was at special teams coordinator Larry Izzo after Houston only had 10 men on the field for a kickoff and had to use a timeout. Still the Texans were able to pull out a 20-13 win over Detroit that keeps them in first place in the AFC South at 5-3.</p> <p>-Cleveland gave winning their first game of the year a real chance, pushing the Jets in the first half before falling 31-28. Josh McCown threw for 341 yards in the defeat.</p> <p>-Drew Brees threw for 265 yards and a touchdown in a 25-20 win over Seattle. The Seahawks offense continued their struggles trailing the defensively-challenged Saints in time of possession 36:12 to 23:48.</p>",

  "<p>On the unassuming second-floor office of a tech startup in Clerkenwell, London, Simon Fox is teaching me how to breathe. \u201cYou\u2019re not trying to shove your stomach out with muscular force,\u201d advises the design director of BfB Labs. \u201cInstead, what you\u2019re trying to do is feel your lungs expanding into your body. You don\u2019t want to breathe hard, but you do want to be breathing into the bottom of your lungs.\u201d</p> <p>Clipped to my earlobe is a tiny heart-rate monitor, linked to a Bluetooth device that is attached to my T-shirt. I\u2019m here to try out what Fox and his colleagues have dubbed emotionally responsive gaming (ERG): computer games designed to increase players\u2019 resilience to mental health problems by using biofeedback to monitor and reward their ability to remain calm under pressure.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/sep/12/can-apps-improve-your-mental-wellbeing\">Can apps improve your mental wellbeing?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Between rounds in Champions of the Shengha, the company\u2019s first offering, gamers must spend about a minute practising the kind of diaphragmatic breathing that is widely recommended as a relaxation technique; the more successfully they control their breathing, the more gems they win to spend on weapons and spells to defeat their opponents. In fact, it\u2019s not the breathing itself that is tracked, but the player\u2019s heart-rate variability (HRV), which increases in response to diaphragmatic breathing and lower levels of stress. A higher variation shows a body with a healthy ability to relax and respond to events.</p> <p>That sounds pretty easy, I think, especially as I\u2019m not really bothered how I fare in the fantasy-themed battling game (\u201cLike Top Trumps but with way more interesting stuff going on,\u201d is Fox\u2019s explanation to a non-gamer). On my first attempt, I get four gems out of a possible 10; not bad for a first try, says Fox, who cites his own experiences of chronic anxiety as a driving force in his work. I\u2019m determined to do better next time.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c7e27cb3eb18eb44ab8154788fe62ec0a73df5bf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c7e27cb3eb18eb44ab8154788fe62ec0a73df5bf/0_5_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The more successfully players control their breathing, the more gems they win to spend on weapons and spells to defeat their opponents.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The more successfully players control their breathing, the more gems they win to spend on weapons and spells to defeat their opponents.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Waugh Manchester Press Phot</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Champions of the Shengha began life more than two years ago, when Shift, a charity that works on behaviour change and social problems, was looking for a way to boost young people\u2019s wellbeing in response to growing evidence of mental health issues among school-age children. It hit upon a computer game as a way of making the prospect of being trained in \u201cemotional regulation\u201d an attractive one, and was awarded \u00a3200,000 funding by Google\u2019s Impact Challenge scheme.</p> <p>Shift later incubated BfB Labs, which took on the development of the game. Keeping it genuinely enjoyable and credible as a game in its own right has always been key; ERG is being marketed to gamers not so much on the basis of its health benefits, but as an exciting new challenge.</p> <p>\u201cHalf of all cases of mental health disorder start by the age of 14, and three-quarters by 24,\u201d says Naomi Stoll, the project\u2019s lead researcher. \u201cMeditation, mindfulness and yoga are not the kinds of things that teenage kids, especially teenagers from disadvantaged backgrounds, are going to think are relevant to them and practise. Even 20 minutes of breathing every day is just not fun in any way.\u201d</p> <p>In a randomised control trial at the Billericay school in Essex earlier this year, more than four-fifths of the 90 pupils who played the game could reliably double their HRV through focused breathing. Three-quarters reported getting better at staying calm within the game, and a quarter said they had started using the techniques in everyday life.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"e5f2c10822bac29dfc5b94701f2e4aea6afdc7de\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e5f2c10822bac29dfc5b94701f2e4aea6afdc7de/1765_0_1983_3325/596.jpg\" alt=\"Three-quarters of players reported getting better at staying calm within the game, and a quarter said they had started using the techniques in everyday life.\" width=\"596\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Three-quarters of players reported getting better at staying calm within the game, and a quarter said they had started using the techniques in everyday life.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Waugh Manchester Press Phot</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The school had already seen a good take-up of mindfulness sessions, says deputy head Charlotte Berry, but it has mainly been girls, whereas Champions of the Shengha, which is played on a phone or tablet, has been embraced by both boys and girls.</p> <p>\u201cThey very quickly started talking about how they were using the breathing in other aspects of their lives,\u201d she says \u2013 including before important football matches, on occasions when they feared they would lose their tempers, and to deal with stress. Twelve-year-old Ryan Gibson used diaphragmatic breathing before his end-of-year exams and says it has also been handy at home: \u201cI\u2019ve got a younger sister who always annoys me. I use it to stop myself from reacting and saying something that would get me in trouble.\u201d</p> <p>Although there are a handful of other developers producing computer games that feed players\u2019 emotions back into play, it\u2019s a tool in its infancy. But gaming seems to have a wider role in promoting good mental health, says Dr Paul Cairns, a reader in human computer interaction at the University of York. \u201cWe feel better when we have a feeling of competence and autonomy,\u201d he says. And games, unlike real life, present well-defined problems that are designed for people to succeed at: \u201cThey offer us the rewards we need.\u201d Crucially, they also provide an escape from isolation, especially when you can play against people around the world online.</p> <p>BfB Labs is planning future games to appeal to different audiences: Fox describes one as a \u201cnoir-y detective thing\u201d where you have to keep your cool through a series of interrogations. Champions of the Shengha has just gone on sale on <a href=\"https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/champions-of-the-shengha-play-with-your-emotions\">the crowdfunding site Indiegogo</a>, where a beta version, including the biofeedback sensor, costs about \u00a327, and there are also options to donate the kit to schools.</p> <p>Back in Clerkenwell, Fox instructs me to place my hands on my chest and stomach to see which bits are moving as I breathe. I may not be engaged with the game itself, but it appears my naturally competitive nature is doing a fine job of ramping up the pressure: I overbreathe noisily. Only on my seventh try do I finally manage a five.</p> <p>The next week, with multiple deadlines looming, I find myself absent-mindedly moving my hand to my stomach and adjusting my breathing.

  "<p>At weekends, the vibrant, crowded streets of Kowloon intensify in Mong Kok to a point where the footfall outpaces London\u2019s rush hour.

  "<p>Cities around the world confront a huge and pressing problem: how do you accommodate growing numbers of people? It is forecast that by 2050, <a href=\"http://www.un.org/en/development/desa/news/population/world-urbanization-prospects-2014.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">two-thirds</a> of the world\u2019s population will live in urban areas, and transport planners face the daunting task of making sure everyone can move around without too much of a struggle.</p> <p>The UK\u2019s population is expected to grow by almost 10 million over the next 25 years \u2013 London\u2019s population could reach 9.8 million by 2025. Since many of our cities already suffer from overcrowding on trains, congestion on roads and worsening air pollution, there is an urgent need to find new ways to adapt to the demographic changes.</p> <p>How will our transport systems cope? How might we best utilise new technologies to make our journeys more productive and less polluting? The Guardian, supported by Heathrow, recently hosted a roundtable discussion to address some of these issues.</p> <p>While the scale of the challenge is formidable, there is optimism cities can handle peak populations and even be made more liveable, the roundtable heard. \u201cTransport is a force for change,\u201d said Susan Claris, associate director at Arup, the engineering, planning and design firm. \u201cIt can help shape better cities, and make them more socially inclusive.\u201d</p> <p>Many of the experts on the panel identified the humble car as holding huge potential for a more efficient transport system. \u201cCars are amazingly efficient vehicles when they have four or five people in them, and we should be doing more to encourage more efficient use,\u201d said Ali Clabburn, CEO of Liftshare, a social enterprise offering commuters the chance to organise shared car journeys. \u201cAt peak hours, every train or bus is full, and there are millions of empty [car] seats on the road. It\u2019s a crazy situation,\u201d she added.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/aug/14/hyperloop-elon-musk-futuristic-technology-transport\">Hyperloop and our misplaced love of futuristic technology</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There is also greater potential for shared ownership of cars, according to Martin Uhlarik, Tata Motors\u2019 UK head of design. \u201cThe shared economy opens up the potential for people to share the product and use [each car] three or four times as much,\u201d he said.</p> <h2>Self-driving cars</h2> <p>Uhlarik believes advances in self-driving technology could change the nature of long car commutes. \u201cAutonomous vehicles will be arriving,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd once they come, we might still spend two hours in traffic, but it\u2019s a chance to question how you are spending that quality time. Are you working? Are you entertaining yourself? It might be about managing your time better.\u201d</p> <p>Working life in Britain today still revolves, largely, around a nine-to-five schedule. Debra Charles, CEO of smartcard company Novacroft, would like to see business and government get behind a major programme to promote flexible working, leading to fewer peak time journeys. \u201cWe\u2019ve got flexible working to some degree in the UK, but what if that was better incentivised? The rigidness of the way people work \u2013 if we could change that it would make a difference.\u201d</p> <p>Shifting the nature of short journeys will also be vital. A recent report by the <a href=\"https://www.london.gov.uk/what-we-do/health/health-publications/health-impacts-cars-london\" rel=\"nofollow\">Greater London Authority</a> found that more than one third of all car trips in the capital are less than 2km, and could be walked in 25 minutes or less. The same report shows 2.7m daily car trips in London could be cycled. Getting people out of their cars and walking or cycling could boost health and reduce congestion.</p> <p>Many cities have made bold moves to encourage active lifestyles. Both New York and Paris have made efforts to repurpose parking spots for walking, biking, and public space. In Copenhagen, pedestrianising shopping streets and raising parking prices has seen the proportion of people driving to work <a href=\"http://kk.sites.itera.dk/apps/kk_pub2/pdf/682_x8IQDnzcpQ.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">fall from 22% to 16% (pdf)</a>. Claris would like to see more trials run by local authorities in the UK to assess the benefits of pedestrianisation. \u201cIf you make cities more pleasant to walk around in, then even the most reluctant walkers will think, \u2018It\u2019s not actually so bad,\u2019\u201d she said.</p> <p>Tom Cohen, deputy director of the UCL Transport Institute, agreed. \u201cPeople are dying because of inactivity. Whatever we might say about the future of transport in cities, it has to incorporate physically active travel.\u201d</p> <h2>Cutting unnecessary road trips</h2> <p>Some business leaders on the panel believe commuters can be usefully nudged into streamlined routines to cut down on unnecessary road trips. Parcel service Doddle, for instance, offers commuters the chance to pick up their online orders from its stores in train stations, saving delivery vans from making so many repeated trips to customers\u2019 doors when they\u2019re out at work. \u201cIf you\u2019re trying to change behaviour, it\u2019s about how intuitive and accessible you make things for people,\u201d said Tim Robinson, Doddle\u2019s CEO.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/jun/03/electric-rickshaws-tuk-city-uber-zero-emission-taxi\">Getting around the city: why electric rickshaws are the tuk of the town</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Rail commuters are already getting their grocery shopping done at major station supermarkets on their way home, and some are also choosing to hold business meetings at station restaurants and cafes. Tim Hedley-Jones, major projects director for Virgin Trains East Coast, said larger train stations are becoming \u201cthe focus of their community\u201d.</p> <p>Hedley-Jones also said the UK could alter planning policy to make better use of the \u201chuge quantities\u201d of brownfield land near train stations. \u201cIf you can give people good quality housing next to good quality public transport, then you can start to break the cycle of car dependency for short journeys.\u201d</p> <p>There remains, however, the almighty task of making sure public transport is ready to cope with increased passenger numbers. Despite major infrastructure projects such as HS2, Crossrail 1 and Crossrail 2, Frank Kelly, professor of environmental health at King\u2019s College London, said even more capacity was needed in the south east, particularly across south London. \u201cIn London, we have a world class transport system, but it\u2019s still not good enough,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to get more people in our underground systems, we need to think about tram systems, and getting it all joined up with the National Rail network in a much better way.\u201d</p> <p>John Holland-Kaye, CEO of Heathrow, which is waiting for parliamentary approval for its third runway, said his airport is experimenting to make sure increasing passenger numbers does not mean more congestion.

  "<p>Nissan was convinced to stay in the UK with a promise of no tariffs or extra bureaucratic burdens on the car industry after Brexit, the business secretary has finally revealed, prompting fears that sector-by-sector deals could cost the taxpayer \u201ccolossal amounts of money\u201d.</p> <p>Greg Clark caved in after four days of pressure in an interview on Sunday to reveal some details of how the government convinced the Japanese manufacturer to produce a fleet of new vehicles at its Sunderland plant. The Tory minister said he wrote to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/nissan\">Nissan</a> with a series of four assurances as he went \u201call out\u201d to allay concerns about Brexit, promising that the government was confident of securing a deal that would keep the car industry competitive.</p> <p>\u201cOur intention, our negotiating remit, when it comes to the discussions with our European partners, is to have a constructive dialogue and look for the common interest here,\u201d Clark told the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr Show. \u201cOur objective would be to ensure we have continued access to the markets in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news\">Europe</a> and vice versa without tariffs and bureaucratic impediments, and that is how we will approach those negotiations.\u201d He suggested that this applied to the car industry in general and possibly to other major sectors of UK business.</p> <p>That suggests No 10 is seeking a free trade relationship for the automotive industry that at least brings benefits similar to membership of the single market and customs union. Theresa May has however said she wants greater immigration controls and freedom from the oversight of the European court of justice \u2013 a combination that Brussels politicians have repeatedly said is unachievable.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/video/2016/oct/30/uk-seeks-brexit-deal-with-no-trade-tariffs-for-car-companies-nissan-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/5a2vk\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2855513\"            data-video-name=\"UK seeks Brexit deal with \u2018no trade tariffs\u2019 for car companies \u2013\u00a0video\"            data-video-provider=\"BBC The Andrew Marr Show\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-5815efc6e4b0219a00d3a47f\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/10/30/161030MarrClark_h264_publish.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11846490&amp;format=video/m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11846490&amp;format=video/webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/video/2016/oct/30/uk-seeks-brexit-deal-with-no-trade-tariffs-for-car-companies-nissan-video\">UK seeks Brexit deal with \u2018no trade tariffs\u2019 for car companies \u2013 video</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>The admission prompted questions about the financial cost of protecting the industry from the impact of Brexit.

The letter contained promises of a continuation of funds for training, skills and scientific research, and regional relocation grants.</p> <p>In his letter to Clark, Clegg said the news that Nissan was staying was welcome, but questioned whether the assurances were \u201cpart of a planned strategy with a desired endpoint or a one-off concession which shows those that shout the loudest get the best deal from ministers\u201d.</p> <p>Clegg, who is playing a leading role in the Open Britain campaign group, called for more clarity on what it meant for No 10\u2019s wider Brexit strategy.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/30/greg-clark-brexit-negotiations-andrew-marr-show-nissan-auto-industry\">Greg Clark's big reveal on 'demeanour' of Brexit negotiations strategy</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cAny assurances given about our future relationship with the customs union and the single market would go to the very heart of the Brexit negotiations, revealing whether the government is intending to stay within either, or whether you intend to negotiate a patchwork of carve-outs, subsidies and sectoral arrangements, which will create winners and losers and may cost the taxpayer colossal amounts of money,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Clark\u2019s interview led to further criticism that the government had been telling industry more about No 10\u2019s negotiating aims than the UK electorate. Clive Lewis, the shadow business secretary, said: \u201cWhile we welcome the commitment to securing tariff-free trade for the automotive sector, Greg Clark has raised more questions than he\u2019s answered. What about other manufacturing sectors, or services, which, let\u2019s not forget, account for 90% of our economy? Nor has the government said anything about how is tariff-free access is going to be achieved.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/keir-starmer\">Keir Starmer</a>, the shadow Brexit secretary, told ITV\u2019s Peston on Sunday that Nissan \u201chas been told more about it than we have in parliament\u201d, adding that the government had \u201cgot to come clean\u201d.

We see them from the 16th century on, often in buildings already centuries old, but there could well be earlier and later marks that just haven\u2019t been recorded.\u201d<br></p> <p>Molyneux, who spotted a mass of marks on the mantelpiece of an old timber-framed house in Warwickshire this week, recorded witches\u2019 marks at Shakespeare\u2019s birthplace several years ago, on timbers of the staircase leading to the cellar. He said: \u201cThey possibly date from the period when the house became a pub, and the beer would have been stored there. You certainly wouldn\u2019t have wanted witches turning your beer sour: that really would have been a disaster.</p> <p>\u201cBasically the marks have been recorded where people have taken the trouble to go and look for them. They are well recorded in many churches, but much less well so in secular buildings. We just don\u2019t have enough data to say whether they are more concentrated in certain parts of the country, or whether patterns are regional, so these are questions we would really like help in answering.\u201d</p> <p>Confusingly, carpenters\u2019 marks indicating how the timbers should be assembled, masons\u2019 marks, and doodles by bored apprentices are often found in the same buildings or even on the same timbers and stone.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"606eebcd3cb14e622b85d3dd17a19542529a9aa5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/606eebcd3cb14e622b85d3dd17a19542529a9aa5/0_0_3500_2340/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Archaeologists examine the markings at Knole in Kent.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"669\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Archaeologists examine the markings at Knole in Kent.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gareth Fuller/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The marks coincide with a period when most interiors lit by rush lights or tallow candles would have been extremely dark once night fell, and when belief in witchcraft and trials of unfortunates accused of it were at their height. The first specific law against witchcraft was only introduced under <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/sep/02/henry-viii-voted-worst-monarch-in-history\">Henry VIII</a> in 1542, and in the 17th century, James I was preoccupied with witchcraft and wrote a treatise on the subject. Recent conservation work revealed a mass of witches\u2019 marks carved into the timbers of rooms which were prepared for his visit at Knole, a palatial house in Kent now owned by the National Trust.</p> <p>The last woman jailed for witchcraft in England was Scottish-born Helen Duncan, a medium arrested while holding a seance in 1944, and accused of betraying war secrets. She was prosecuted for fraud and witchcraft, and served nine months in Holloway prison.</p> <p>The witches\u2019 marks are properly known as apotropaic marks, from the Greek word for avoiding evil.</p> <p>Duncan Wilson, chief executive of Historic England, said: \u201cThey really fire the imagination and can teach us about previously held beliefs and common rituals. Ritual marks were cut, scratched or carved into our ancestors\u2019 homes and churches in the hope of making the world a safer, less hostile place.\u201d</p>",
  "<p> London\u2019s housing crisis will move north unless radical powers are handed to mayors in Liverpool, Greater Manchester and the West Midlands, experts have warned.</p> <p>The thinktank, Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR), said ministers would miss their target of building 1m new homes by 2020 unless it devolved power over housing to the regions.</p> <p>Ed Cox, the director of IPPR North, said: \u201cThe \u2019northern powerhouse\u2019 and \u2019Midlands engine\u2019 would be driven by mayors and it\u2019s vital they have the powers to build enough homes \u2013 recreating a London housing crisis in regional cities would be a disaster.\u201d<br></p> <p>The warning came amid reports that the government is looking at constructing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/oct/30/wave-of-prefab-homes-planned-to-tackle-uk-housing-crisis\">more than 100,000 pre-packed modular homes</a> in an attempt to solve the housing crisis.</p> <p>In an initiative that mirrors the wave of prefabs built following the second world war, ministers are reportedly keen to encourage banks to lend to companies that build the homes off-site \u2013 some in as little as a day \u2013 before delivering them to their final destination.</p> <p>The IPPR North study, Closer to Home, said the metro mayors, due to be elected in May 2017, should be given control over the 1.6m hectares of greenbelt land in England to alleviate the shortage of affordable housing. It found a huge gap between the amount of available brownfield land and the long-term housing need.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/01/theresa-may-confusion-northern-powerhouse-labour-andy-burnham-steve-rotheram\">Theresa May urged to end 'confusion' over northern powerhouse</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In the north-west of England, there was a long-term need for 263,168 new homes but a brownfield capacity of only 166,211 homes. In the West Midlands and Yorkshire and Humber, that gap grew to more than 200,000 homes respectively.</p> <p>Andy Burnham MP, Labour\u2019s candidate for mayor of Greater Manchester, said: \u201cThis report is spot-on: Westminster has created a housing crisis across the country and the new mayors must be given the powers to fix it.<br></p> <p>\u201cIn addition to the proposals in this report, I will be calling for stronger compulsory purchase powers over absent private landlords and the government needs to allow the mayor to refocus the Greater Manchester housing fund away from luxury development and towards council and social housing.\u201d</p> <p>The report also called for mayors to be handed stamp duty proceeds from new-build homes as an incentive to increase supply. It also said mayors should be able to put levies on empty homes, similar to local authority powers in Scotland.</p> <p>Labour\u2019s candidate for West Midlands mayor, Si\u00f4n Simon, added: \u201cFor too long, the West Midlands\u2019 interests have been put second to London\u2019s. Their interests are not ours. Next May\u2019s election is an opportunity to take back control of our own affairs. Nowhere is this more important than on decisions about our future housing needs.</p> <p>\u201cThe housing funding unlocked for the new mayor is great for us, but we need more powers from London to our region to have control over the types of housing that we need and want to build.\u201d</p> <p>Ministers have previously been warned that they are set to miss their 1m new homes target without radical change. A cross-party House of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/housing-network/2016/jul/18/brexit-aftermath-housing-policy-review-house-of-lords-gavin-barwell\">Lords committee said in July that the government must build 300,000 homes each year</a> in England to help solve the housing crisis, an increase of 50% from its current target.</p> <p>The Department for Communities and Local Government cited a \u00a3300m loan fund in Manchester and a \u00a3170m government investment in Cambridge and Peterborough to deliver affordable homes. A DCLG spokesman said: \u201cDevolution deals provide opportunities so that communities work for everyone and the nine deals we have in place all include measures to deliver new homes.</p> <p> \u201cThis is part of a wider bottom-up approach we\u2019re taking to ensure people get a greater say over how their areas are developed. This also includes the neighbourhood planning bill and investment.\u201d<br></p>"
