  "<p>Tony Abbott has joined Malcolm Turnbull and a growing chorus of Liberals calling for only individuals to be allowed to donate to political parties, in effect banning union, foreign and corporate donations.</p> <p>Labor backs a ban on foreign donations but opposes a ban on union and corporate donations which shadow attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, has warned the high court has already found is unconstitutional.</p> <p>The Coalition is now seeking to widen the reform conversation to include spending on political campaigns by third-party entities, including unions and GetUp.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/08/malcolm-turnbull-says-ideally-donations-should-be-limited-to-australian-voters\">Malcolm Turnbull says 'ideally' donations should be limited to Australian voters</a> </p> </aside>  <p>According to a Fairfax media report, Abbott has said: \u201cWe need to look long and hard at restricting donations to real people on the electoral roll.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTo that end, there should be no union donations, company donations or foreign donations.\u201d</p> <p>Abbott also suggested that real-time or \u201cnear-to-real-time\u201d disclosure was the best way to ensure full transparency and prevent \u201cinfluence buying\u201d.</p> <p>He stopped short of calling for caps on donations, saying it was \u201ca good thing\u201d for individuals to donate to their party of choice \u2013 even \u201csubstantially ... as long as there is that transparency\u201d.</p> <p>On Thursday, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/08/malcolm-turnbull-says-ideally-donations-should-be-limited-to-australian-voters\">Turnbull backed the same position on donations</a>, which is shared by a number of ministers including Christopher Pyne. </p> <p>\u201cIdeally, donations to political parties should be limited to people who are on the electoral roll \u2013 voters,\u201d Turnbull said.</p> <p>But he noted the reform faced \u201cbig legal issues and some constitutional issues\u201d.</p> <p>In 2013 the high court found that a New South Wales law limiting donations to individuals <a href=\"http://www.hcourt.gov.au/assets/publications/judgment-summaries/2013/hca58-2013-12-18.pdf\">breached the implied freedom of political communication</a>.</p> <p>On ABC\u2019s 7:30 program on Thursday, Dreyfus said the high court \u201chas said absolutely clearly that you can\u2019t, within our constitution, ban corporations from making donations or ban unions from making donations\u201d. </p> <p>He called Turnbull \u201can absolute hypocrite\u201d for opposing union and corporate donations, after reports he made <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/jul/15/malcolm-turnbull-reportedly-gave-1m-to-liberal-party-for-election-ads\">a large personal donation to the Liberal party ahead of the 2016 election</a>, which Turnbull has never denied.</p> <p>\u201cApparently in his ideal world, only very wealthy individuals like himself would be able to give $1 or 2m dollars to their own political party to buy an election result,\u201d Dreyfus said.</p> <p>The shadow attorney general said under current laws donations do not need to be disclosed for 18 months. He said Turnbull was \u201call talk and no action\u201d and called on him to sit down with Labor so \u201cwe can get somewhere on donations reform\u201d.</p> <p>Dreyfus said Labor wants a ban on foreign donations, lowering the limit for disclosure of donations to $1,000 from $13,200 and real-time disclosure. He said there should be \u201cno donation splitting\u201d, which allows individuals to give donations to separate branches of the same party to avoid disclosure.</p> <p>Asked whether dual citizens would be excluded by a foreign donations ban, Dreyfus said it was a detail that needs to be \u201cironed out\u201d and they might not be excluded, particularly if they are Australian residents.</p> <p>On Friday Pyne told Nine\u2019s Today program he was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/08/sam-dastyari-resignation-coalition-open-to-labor-calls-for-donation-reform\">also in favour of banning union and corporate donations</a>, so that only individuals could donate to political parties.</p> <p>\u201cYou would have to do something about third party campaigning otherwise the unions will get their money together and use it to campaign against the Liberal party,\u201d he added.</p> <p>\u201cIt is not as simple as everyone thinks it is and that\u2019s why it has to be done sensibly and calmly and put through a proper process. </p> <p>\u201cYou can\u2019t just ban donations from one group and then not expect there could be a flow-on effect elsewhere.\u201d</p> <p>Donations reform will now be considered by the joint standing committee on electoral matters.</p> <p>There is some talk in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/coalition\">Coalition</a> circles about a Canadian provision that restricts campaigns by third-party groups during election seasons.</p> <p>Under electoral law in Canada, third-party activist groups are permitted to spend what they like on advertising before the start of an election campaign but, once the writs are issued, spending is capped, which works to limit the influence of these groups. <br></p> <p>New South Wales electoral law still contains a<a href=\"http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/efeada1981443/s95f.html\"> similar provision restricting spending on electoral communication</a> during state election campaigns to $1.05m for registered third-party campaigns.

We\u2019ve seen an escalation in bikie laws particularly all over the country by both sides of politics here. There hasn\u2019t been a single side of politics that says we want lighter sentences.\u201d</p> <p>The fact Labor was yet to strip back many harsh sentencing measures for gang and drug crime introduced under Newman, including anti-bikie laws that high-level independent reviews had recommended repealing, further belied Dutton\u2019s claim, Ananian-Welsh said.</p> <p>\u201cSo there are much clearer actions [Labor] could be taking around just implementing the recommendations of inquiries rather than this very abstract allegation that they would appoint a judge in the hope that that judge whilst on the bench would deliver lighter sentences,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Ananian-Welsh said Dutton\u2019s attack \u201cjust absolutely highlights the necessity for reform\u201d around judicial appointments in Queensland, where there is no independent judicial commission as there is in New South Wales.</p> <p>\u201cWe need a process that is clear and ensures that judicial appointments are justified by reference to publicly available standards, so that everyone knows exactly why a judge was appointed. </p> <p>\u201cAnd then we don\u2019t get into these kind of arguments.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>The first international beauty contest judged by \u201cmachines\u201d was supposed to use objective factors such as facial symmetry and wrinkles to identify the most attractive contestants. After <a href=\"http://beauty.ai/\">Beauty.AI</a> launched this year, roughly 6,000 people from more than 100 countries submitted photos in the hopes that artificial intelligence, supported by complex algorithms, would determine that their faces most closely resembled \u201chuman beauty\u201d.</p> <p>But when the results came in, the creators were dismayed to see that there was a glaring factor linking the winners: the robots did not like people with dark skin.</p> <p>Out of 44 <a href=\"http://winners2.beauty.ai/#win\">winners</a>, nearly all were white, a handful were Asian, and only one had dark skin. That\u2019s despite the fact that, although the majority of contestants were white, many people of color submitted photos, including large groups from India and Africa.</p> <p>The ensuing <a href=\"http://motherboard.vice.com/read/why-an-ai-judged-beauty-contest-picked-nearly-all-white-winners\">controversy</a> has sparked renewed debates about the ways in which algorithms can perpetuate biases, yielding unintended and often offensive results. </p> <p>When Microsoft released the \u201cmillennial\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/mar/24/microsoft-scrambles-limit-pr-damage-over-abusive-ai-bot-tay\">chatbot named Tay</a> in March, it quickly began using racist language and promoting neo-Nazi views on Twitter.

In some cases, it can have devastating consequences for people of color.</p> <p>Beauty.AI \u2013 which was created by a \u201cdeep learning\u201d group called Youth Laboratories and supported by Microsoft \u2013 relied on large datasets of photos to build an algorithm that assessed beauty. While there are a number of reasons why the algorithm favored white people, the main problem was that the data the project used to establish standards of attractiveness did not include enough minorities, said Alex Zhavoronkov, Beauty.AI\u2019s chief science officer.</p> <p>Although the group did not build the algorithm to treat light skin as a sign of beauty, the input data effectively led the robot judges to reach that conclusion.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"614a5887f55ccf0103fda08b76638da0285ee6d0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/614a5887f55ccf0103fda08b76638da0285ee6d0/137_63_1010_606/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Winners of the Beauty.AI contest in the category for women aged 18-29.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Winners of the Beauty.AI contest in the category for women aged 18-29.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: http://winners2.beauty.ai/#win</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIf you have not that many people of color within the dataset, then you might actually have biased results,\u201d said Zhavoronkov, who said he was surprised by the winners. \u201cWhen you\u2019re training an algorithm to recognize certain patterns \u2026 you might not have enough data, or the data might be biased.\u201d</p> <p>The simplest explanation for biased algorithms is that the humans who create them have their own deeply entrenched biases. That means that despite perceptions that algorithms are somehow neutral and uniquely objective, they can often reproduce and amplify existing prejudices.</p> <p>The Beauty.AI results offer \u201cthe perfect illustration of the problem\u201d, said Bernard Harcourt, Columbia University professor of law and political science who has studied \u201cpredictive policing\u201d, which has increasingly relied on machines. \u201cThe idea that you could come up with a culturally neutral, racially neutral conception of beauty is simply mind-boggling.\u201d</p> <p>The case is a reminder that \u201chumans are really doing the thinking, even when it\u2019s couched as algorithms and we think it\u2019s neutral and scientific,\u201d he said.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/31/predictive-policing-civil-rights-coalition-aclu\">Civil liberty groups</a> have recently raised concerns that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jun/26/algorithms-racial-bias-offenders-florida\">computer-based law enforcement forecasting tools</a> \u2013 which use data to predict where future crimes will occur \u2013 rely on flawed statistics and can exacerbate racially biased and harmful policing practices. </p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s polluted data producing polluted results,\u201d said Malkia Cyril, executive director of the Center for Media Justice.</p> <p>A <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/machine-bias-risk-assessments-in-criminal-sentencing\">ProPublica investigation</a> earlier this year found that software used to predict future criminals is biased against black people, which can lead to harsher sentencing.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s truly a matter of somebody\u2019s life is at stake,\u201d said Sorelle Friedler, a professor of computer science at Haverford College.</p> <p>A major problem, Friedler said, is that minority groups by nature are often underrepresented in datasets, which means algorithms can reach inaccurate conclusions for those populations and the creators won\u2019t detect it. For example, she said, an algorithm that was biased against Native Americans could be considered a success given that they are only 2% of the population.</p> <p>\u201cYou could have a 98% accuracy rate. You would think you have done a great job on the algorithm.\u201d</p> <p>Friedler said there are proactive ways algorithms can be adjusted to correct for biases whether improving input data or implementing filters to ensure people of different races are receiving equal treatment.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/26/opinion/sunday/artificial-intelligences-white-guy-problem.html\">Prejudiced AI programs</a> aren\u2019t limited to the criminal justice system. One <a href=\"http://www.cmu.edu/news/stories/archives/2015/july/online-ads-research.html\">study</a> determined that significantly fewer women than men were shown online ads for high-paying jobs. Last year, Google\u2019s photo app was found to have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jul/01/google-sorry-racist-auto-tag-photo-app\">labeled black people as gorillas</a>.</p> <p>Cyril noted that algorithms are ultimately very limited in how they can help correct societal inequalities. \u201cWe\u2019re overly relying on technology and algorithms and machine learning when we should be looking at institutional changes.\u201d</p> <p>Zhavoronkov said that when Beauty.AI launches another contest round this fall, he expects the algorithm will have a number of changes designed to weed out discriminatory results. \u201cWe will try to correct it.\u201d<br></p> <p>But the reality, he added, is that robots may not be the best judges of physical appearance: \u201cI was more surprised about how the algorithm chose the most beautiful people. Out of a very large number, they chose people who I may not have selected myself.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>It was always going to take a minor miracle for St Helens to surrender their position in the final weeks of the season, but with a play-off spot now secured following a ninth win in ten games, a glance at the fixture list offers hope yet that a home semi-final in the play-offs and a top-two finish may still not be beyond them in 2016.</p> <p>When they were struggling, midway through this year, Saints fans would have been forgiven for being happy just to make the top four and at times, even that had looked beyond Keiron Cunningham\u2019s side.</p> <p>But just as they have done so many times in the past, the Saints are peaking at the right time. They have the two supposed weakest teams in the Super 8s in Wakefield and Widnes left to play, while the other semi-finalists \u2013 Wigan, Warrington and Hull FC \u2013 all still have to play each other in the final three weeks.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/08/kevin-sinfield-turned-down-clubs-rfl-rugby-director\">Kevin Sinfield turned down playing offers to become RFL\u2019s rugby director</a> </p> </aside>  <p>That guarantees there will be points dropped in and around Saints, leaving the door ajar for Cunningham\u2019s men to strike: even if they were not at their best here. They ran in seven tries and 40 points against an injury-hit Castleford side with little to play for - but you suspect there is still more to come as the intensity rises and the play-offs approach. \u201cIt\u2019s not a bad spot to be in,\u201d said Cunningham. \u201cWe\u2019re not talking about the top two or anything yet; there\u2019s a lot of points still to be played for and a lot of games to play.\u201d</p> <p>This has been a long, arduous season for the Tigers \u2013 and the fact they may yet finish fifth despite suffering so many injuries is a testimony to the impressive work done by Daryl Powell. Without a dozen first-team regulars due to injury, they put up a commendable effort all night, and they actually led on two separate occasions in the first half to forge a 10-6 advantage. But with three teenagers on their bench \u2013 as well as the winger, Paddy Flynn, who actually played in the forwards \u2013 the balance of the contest began to turn as the interchanges came into play. \u201cI thought in a lot of ways it was an awesome effort from us,\u201d said the Castleford coach, Daryl Powell. \u201cWe started well but maintaining that was tough with everything going on. We could have done with one less try against us at half-time really.\u201d</p> <p>An eight-minute period towards the end of the first half proved to be the difference, as tries from Morgan Knowles, Kyle Amor and Luke Thompson - as well as Rangi Chase being sent to the sin-bin - completely took the game away from Castleford as Saints took control of the game to lead 24-10 at the break.</p> <p>To their credit, Castleford held out for the opening 20 minutes of the second half, but as it wore on and fatigue began to set in again, they were exposed once more in defence with three more Saints tries in the final quarter.</p> <p>Both Louie McCarthy-Scarsbrook and Adam Swift ensured the Saints racked up the necessary points to move above Wigan on points difference into third, and although the Tigers got a deserved try for their efforts late on when Will Maher touched down, the Saints had the final say when Alex Walmsley charged over to keep their hopes of a home semi-final very much alive.</p> <p><strong>St Helens</strong> Lomax; Owens, Peyroux, Fleming, Swift; Turner, Walsh; Walmsley, Roby, Richards, Wilkin, Greenwood, McCarthy-Scarsbrook. <strong>Interchange</strong> Amor, Vea, Thompson, Knowles.</p> <p><strong>Tries </strong>Fleming, Knowles, Amor, Thompson, McCarthy-Scarsbrook, Swift, Walmsley. <strong>Goals</strong> Walsh 5, Owens.</p> <p><strong>Castleford</strong> Dorn; Hampshire, Crooks, Minikin, Solomona; Chase, Gale; Cook, McShane, Patrick, Webster, Moors, Milner. <strong>Interchange </strong>Maher, Fitzsimons, Flynn, Douglas.</p> <p><strong>Tries</strong> Dorn, Hampshire, Maher. <strong>Goals</strong> Gale 2. <strong>Sin-bin</strong> Chase (35).</p> <p><strong>Referee</strong> J Smith.

In such deep waters, the only activity that was likely to disturb them is oil or gas drilling.</p> <p>Hanson-Young said on her fact-finding mission people were often shocked oil exploration would be allowed in a marine reserve. \u201cWhat is the point of having these places if a company can come and drill for oil?\u201d</p> <p>Veteran environmentalist and former Greens leader Bob Brown recently returned from a trip to the Great Australian Bight, and told Guardian Australia: \u201cIt would be very unwise for BP to move that leased oil rig from South Korea\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThis is rapidly growing into a national and international furore,\u201d he said, saying NOPSEMA appeared to be working too closely with BP, and not giving the public the information it needed to properly scrutinise the plans.</p> <p>An oil spill in the Great Australian Bight could threaten South Australia\u2019s $442m fishing industry and coastal tourism industry, which could be worth more than $1bn and employs <a href=\"http://www.aph.gov.au/DocumentStore.ashx?id=cc8244da-9474-42f9-85e2-c040adc9dbdb&amp;subId=412135\">almost 7,000 people</a>.</p> <p>In 2010, BP was responsible for the world\u2019s biggest oil spill, at the Deepwater Horizon in the Gulf of Mexico. That occurred in waters that were significantly calmer and more shallow than the wells proposed in the Great Australian Bight.</p> <p>BP maintains that oil and gas exploration can safely coexist with the marine environment. \u201cWe have assessed potential environmental issues from exploration activities in the Great Australian Bight and in turn incorporated this into our planning,\u201d a spokeswoman <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/06/bp-reveals-great-australian-bight-oil-drilling-sites-are-within-marine-reserve\">told Guardian Australia earlier this month</a>.</p>",

  "<h2>1994 qualifying final: North Melbourne vs Hawthorn</h2> <p>As the final siren rang out across Waverley Park at the conclusion of the first qualifying final of 1994, signalling a dramatic draw, Hawthorn had reason to believe they would still get the job done. Been there, done that, will do it again. But <em>extra time</em>? That was a new one.</p> <p>A new one and for the Hawks not a pleasant one, as it turned out. The rule change that enabled those 10 added minutes had been instituted by the league following the mass bellyaching over West Coast and Collingwood\u2019s tied final at the same ground in 1990. Having finished regular time 13.13 (91) to North\u2019s 12.19 (91), the Hawks came out for the resumption of hostilities and promptly fell flat on their faces, going scoreless as they were eviscerated by underrated Craig Sholl, evergreen John Longmire and indescribable Wayne Carey, the latter of whom emphatically confirmed his greatness on the September stage. </p> <p>Seven commentator Peter Landy had at least been right in his exhortation that viewers \u201cgo to the fridge and get another coldie out,\u201d but for the first time in almost two decades it was North who\u2019d played champagne finals football.</p> <p>The memory that sticks out: thickly mulleted Carey, just 23 years old but already more physically imposing than two men combined, treating 31-year-old champion defender Chris Langford like a budget rental car. Carey soared over packs and ripped the ball out of the sky, looking like some kind of Antipodean Hasselhoff as he mowed down defenders. The stats tell us Carey took 10 marks. It felt like 30. Apparently he only kicked four goals. It seemed closer to 12. </p> <p>The vision below not only confirms all those feelings, it also reminds us that Adrian McAdam did indeed exist after 1993. Hawthorn weren\u2019t immediately knocked out of the race, as it turned out. After that game they had to sit around and wait for an entire agonising day and sweat on the results of the other finals. In the end it was David Schwarz\u2019s Carey-like destruction of Carlton that put paid to their campaign.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydb--Z6ycSc\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ydb--Z6ycSc?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Carey mania: the 1994 AFL qualifying final between Hawthorn and North Melbourne.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>The result was also confirmation that Hawthorn\u2019s golden run was over. Tim Harvgreaves, Shayne Stevenson and Rayden Tallis were triers, but hardly names to strike fear into the hearts of the opposition like Ayres, DiPierdomenico and Brereton had been. Relatively speaking, the Hawks went into free-fall in the years following, finishing well out of contention for the best part of the next dozen seasons, though supporters who view that fallow period as the \u201cdark years\u201d should be biffed around the ears with one of those 13 premiership cups.</p> <p>One final question from this game: what came first, Denis Pagan\u2019s Wayne Carey hairdo or Wayne Carey\u2019s Denis Pagan hairdo?</p> <h2>1979 elimination final: Fitzroy vs Essendon</h2> <p>Maybe if he\u2019d actually won the Brownlow medal he deserved, or if he\u2019d played for a bigger club like Collingwood or Carlton, Garry Wilson\u2019s name would roll off the tongue of every football fan in the land. Fitzroy\u2019s fearless champion was never better than in his first ever finals appearance in the 1979 elimination final against Essendon, which was also the Roy Boys\u2019 first since 1960.</p> <p>Fitzroy\u2019s form had been a little patchy heading into this winner-takes-all contest; they\u2019d missed the double chance with a late-season loss to Geelong so not even the most optimistic Lions fan would have foretold the opening quarter blitzkrieg that knocked Essendon flat. The Roys had 4.3 on the board before the Bombers even scored. By quarter time and with Wilson pumping the ball forward from every centre bounce, they\u2019d drilled a record 9.4 to snuff out any hope of an Essendon win. </p> <p>In the end the Roys finished with 17.22 to romp home by 81 points thanks in no small part to four goals from Quinlan and three to Robert Walls, but it was the stat line of Wilson, sans helmet, that stood out in a game in which he seemed hall-bent on single-handedly wresting control of the day; 17 kicks, 25 handballs, seven marks and two goals. Unfortunately his and Fitzroy\u2019s jubilation was short-lived. The Lions lost by 22 points in the next weekend\u2019s semi-final against Collingwood.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bkzn7CyEnzY\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Bkzn7CyEnzY?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>1979 elimination final - Fitzroy vs Essenson.</figcaption> </figure>   <h2>2013 elimination final: Richmond vs Carlton</h2> <p>Those who were sitting inside the MCG to see a resurgent Richmond take on lucky losers Carlton in the first elimination final of 2013 will tell you that it was one of the loudest football crowds they\u2019ve ever been part of. Lunatic levels of passion. Unhinged. Supporters speaking in tongues. There were 94,690 in the house that day, screaming their way through one of the most enthralling finals contests of the last decade. </p> <p>Having finished ninth in the regular season but benefitting from the chaos of Essendon\u2019s exclusion, Carlton should not have been there, of course, but that only added to the existential agony of success-starved Richmond supporters. \u201cAfter years of finishing ninth we\u2019re going to lose a final to the team that finished ninth, aren\u2019t we?\u201d Well, yes, unfortunately, and it was only made worse by the fact that the Tigers had Mick Malthouse\u2019s Blues on the rack in the first half, seemingly defying bad omens like Reece Conca\u2019s hamstring blow-out and Dustin Martin\u2019s infamous \u2018jailbird\u2019 goal celebration to lead by 26 points at half-time.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"deaca71fa19ec62f4eb6f755d2f10b507c616e46\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/deaca71fa19ec62f4eb6f755d2f10b507c616e46/0_141_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Footballers\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Carlton\u2019s four-goal hero Nick Duigan celebrates with Jeff Garlett during Carlton\u2019s 2013 AFL elimination final win over Richmond.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Dodge/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Then came the somewhat inevitable, almost delirious self-destruction. Blues livewire Jeff Garlett started kicking goals. Tiger nerves jangled. Jarrad Waite started plucking marks from nowhere and setting up goals. Richmond fists shook. In the final term, the Blues simply ran away with it. Ivan Maric, who\u2019d been a rock for the Tigers all year, was shoved aside by Waite to set up a goal for Chris Judd. Late-blooming Nick Duigan, who doubted he\u2019d be picked in Carlton\u2019s final side and had managed only six goals across 42 previous league games, confidently slotted his fourth, then Garlett iced it with a Tiger-baiting stroll towards an open goal. </p> <p>Having spent the half-time break making travel plans for a semi-final in Sydney, Richmond supporters were left to skulk back down Brunton Avenue with 15 years of angst pouring out of them and their tails between their legs.</p> <h2>1991 elimination final: Geelong vs St Kilda</h2> <p>Tony Lockett blamed himself for St Kilda\u2019s seven-point loss to Geelong in the 1991 elimination final. The Saints spearhead had his share of knockers over the years but was always his own harshest critic. Furious with a couple of early misses in his nine-goal, five-behind virtuoso performance from the goal square, Plugger was inconsolable after his side squandered their first finals appearance since 1973. But what a game it was \u2013 Lockett and Geelong\u2019s eight-goal hero Billy Brownless trading blows until the Cats prevailed in a nail-biter.</p> <p>Lockett had been near invincible that year, missing the first six games of the season with injury but then laying waste to almost every backline in the competition. With nine against Geelong in that final he\u2019d made it 43 goals for the month. In his delayed opening three games of the season he\u2019d hammered through 34 majors, eventually finishing with 127 from 17 games at a Hurculean average of 7.47 goals per game. </p> <p>But he couldn\u2019t forgive himself for what he saw as a failure to drag the Saints over the line when it mattered. Never mind the barrage of injuries \u2013 Nathan Burke was knocked out early in the game by an errant Gary Ablett elbow, late selection Ricky Nixon\u2019s hamstring was cooked \u2013 that had St Kilda hobbling home without a fit player on the bench.</p> <p>That 1991 finals series was also notable for being the first season of the needlessly convoluted original McIntyre final six system, which in the end had the impact of duping the Saints; they and Geelong were among the most consistently brilliant teams that year but only one would survive the first week of September, and the McIntyre six made it possible for the 3rd place team to exit the finals in with a single loss.</p> <p>Even Cats coach Malcolm Blight had sympathy for the vanquished. \u201cIt\u2019s almost wrong, isn\u2019t it, when you see a game like that?\u201d he said after the game. \u201cI really do feel for them because they\u2019re worthy...anyone could have won the game.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>1986 elimination final: Fitzroy vs Essendon</strong></h2> <p>What if I told you that a Fitzroy qualifying team that omitted champions Bernie Quinlan and Matt Rendell \u2013 and contained a man wearing 19th century knickerbockers to protect his injured thighs \u2013 beat an Essendon side who\u2019d just won two premierships on the bounce? OK, maybe it\u2019s not the sexiest \u201c30 for 30\u201d intro, but it did actually happen.</p> <p>Nobody gave the Roys a chance in hell heading into this game. Whereas the Dons had just won back-to-back flags, the Lions were very much the red-headed stepchild of league football; under-resourced and almost insolvent, wandering from home to home and only still drawing a crowd on account of a truly special generation of players. </p> <p>But then it all went haywire. Rain started bucketed down at Waverley Park and Fitzroy selected bravely by resisting the temptation to pick underdone Quinlan and Rendell. Taking on the might of Simon Madden and Paul Salmon instead was Michael Reeves, he of the aforementioned ye olde pantaloon arrangement \u2013 actually a cut-off pair of blue and red adidas three-stipe tracky dacks with padding stuffed inside. At Fitzroy, that counted as sports science.</p> <p>And it worked. Along with Gary Keane, who relieved him the closing stages of the game, Reeves was slaughtered in the hit-out stats but his determined efforts in bringing the ball to ground for the likes of Bernie and Leon Harris, combined with the driving rain, meant that on a literally waterlogged and thus figuratively levelled playing field, the Roys were still a puncher\u2019s chance. </p> <p>Essendon led the game by three points at the final change after an attritional day of football, which led to six reports, but with stellar games from Paul Roos, Tim Pekin and Scott McIvor, Fitzroy hung tough, never allowing the Dons to run off with it as they probably should have. When Mick Conlan put Fitzroy one point ahead with only 45 seconds left on the clock, the Lions somehow managed to hang on for a spectacular upset win. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9phBQcM6gc\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/z9phBQcM6gc?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Fitzroy triumph in the 1986 elimination final.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>\u201cThey have the biggest hearts in football we\u2019ve seen in a long, long time,\u201d said Lou Richards after the game, and those words were just as apt the following week when the Roys upstaged Sydney in another rain-drenched game, kicking four goals in eight minutes to snatch the semi-final after trailing by 20 points deep into the third term. That majestic run ended in the preliminary final a week later. Sadly, Fitzroy\u2019s senior side would never again feature in September action.</p> <h2>2000 elimination final: Hawthorn vs Geelong</h2> <p>Remember Glen Bowyer? OK, fair enough. The Hawk-turned-Blue didn\u2019t set many hearts aflutter in his 55-game career but he did provide the highlight of a surprisingly gripping first elimination final in 2000 and one of the most underrated of all finals goals when he ripped the ball out of team-mate Nathan Thompson\u2019s hands and curled a miraculous 40-metre post-high checkside through the middle in Hawthorn\u2019s nine-point win.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MNP8qO5fcw\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/-MNP8qO5fcw?start=803&wmode=opaque&feature=oembed&start=803\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Glen Bowyer\u2019s 2000 elimination final wonder-goal.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>The match itself was a belter, if a little obscured now, because with the passing of time we don\u2019t tend to rate finals games so highly when they feature teams who didn\u2019t make it to the final week of September. In typical Hawthorn-Geelong style, the lead changed six times as the Cats kept counter-punching and willing themselves back into the contest.</p> <p>In addition to Bowyer\u2019s gem, Shane Crawford took a screamer over Brad Sholl and it was a coming-of-age game for John Barker, who\u2019d been much-maligned at Brisbane as one of the eight players who moved across from Fitzroy. Here his four goals were the difference as the Hawks got home by nine points in the first ever final at the Docklands stadium. To top it off, and like all great finals of the era, it featured a special guest appearance from Barry Young.</p>",

  "<p> One network\u2019s pain is a rival network\u2019s joy. Seven\u2019s Sunday Night program has filmed an exclusive interview with Adam Whittington, the bloke who organised for Sally Faulkner\u2019s children to be abducted from a street in Beirut after they were taken to Lebanon by their father. The doomed abduction \u2013 organised with the help of Channel Nine \u2013 ended up with Faulkner, Whittington and two of his colleagues, the 60 Minutes reporter Tara Brown and three other Nine crew members being jailed in Beirut on kidnapping charges.

On the morning of the unveiling of Di Stefano\u2019s campaign diary, What a Time to Be Alive: That and Other Lies of the 2016 Campaign, Dastyari spoilt the party by pulling out. He was replaced by the Labor MP Terri Butler at the last minute. But Butler, who won Kevin Rudd\u2019s old seat of Griffith at the election, was so funny the crowd soon forgot all about Dastyari. BuzzFeed Australia\u2019s editor, Simon Crerar, revealed that when Di Stefano was the ABC\u2019s Darwin reporter he applied for a job at BuzzFeed by sending through his CV with a list of \u201cnine reasons why you should hire me\u201d.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <h2>Triple J, aka the decline of western civilisation</h2> <p> In other publishing news, the new book by the Australian\u2019s former editor-in-chief Chris Mitchell will be launched by Malcolm Turnbull in Sydney this month.

  "<p>MPs opposed to a strongly worded draft select committee report attacking UK arms sales to Saudi Arabia withdrew from a critical meeting on Monday night in a bid to prevent other MPs going ahead with a vote on the report, it was alleged in parliament.</p> <p>The alleged ploy, revealed by a frustrated Labour MP opposed to the sales, suggests that high-stakes political manoeuvring is under way. Some MPs are seeking to water down the committees on arms export controls draft report and so preserve the current strong diplomatic UK relations with Saudi Arabia.</p> <p>A strong call from the committee to suspend arms export licences pending an independent UN-led investigation of the Saudi bombing campaign in Yemen could not be readily ignored by the government, and would infuriate the defence industry.</p> <p>The chair of the foreign affairs select committee, Crispin Blunt, angered by leaks on BBC Newsnight and in the Guardian, called for private investigators to be hired by parliament to investigate the source of them, describing them as some of the most serious in his near-20-year parliamentary career.</p> <p>The alleged manoeuvre to frustrate the work of the committees on arms export controls was revealed by Labour\u2019s Stephen Doughty, a member of the committee, during a point of order in the Commons.</p> <p>The committee had been convened on Wednesday to vote on a draft report critical of ministers\u2019 assurances that there was no risk of a breach of international human rights law by Saudi Arabia in its bombing campaign in Yemen.</p> <p>More than 130 amendments had been tabled by the pro-defence industry Labour MP John Spellar and Blunt, broadly designed to water down the original draft, and exclude any call for a UK suspension of arms sales. Both MPs, along with ministers, felt that the draft was one-sided in its criticism of Saudi Arabia, and did not take account of the conduct of Houthi militias in a bloody 18-month civil war.</p> <p>MPs are not allowed to reveal the details of private select committee proceedings, but Doughty partly lifted the veil of secrecy during a point of order, including an apparent effort to prevent a quorum by MPs leaving the committee meeting.</p> <p>He asked: \u201cIs it in order for MPs to withdraw from the proceedings at a crucial moment in those proceedings to frustrate the moving on to formal consideration of matters in that committee, and declaring they were doing so with the express intent of withdrawing to prevent those proceedings from going forward with the knock-on effect that other members from their constituent committees were not able then to speak, take part, or vote in the proceedings of the committee?\u201d </p> <p>The arms exports committee is made up of four different select committees.</p> <p>The controversial draft, prepared before the end of the summer recess, says it seems \u201cinevitable\u201d that violations of international humanitarian laws have involved arms supplied by the UK. It says: \u201cGiven that the UK has a long history of defence exports to Saudi Arabia and considering the evidence we heard, it seems inevitable that any violations of international humanitarian law by the coalition have involved arms supplied by the UK.\u201d</p> <p>It adds: \u201cThe government has relied almost exclusively on assurances from the Saudi government that the coalition is operating within the boundaries of international law despite the fact that we heard very credible sources to the contrary. We have found the government\u2019s arms export licensing regime, which it repeatedly asserts is robust, is in fact to a large extent opaque and the government too often relies on assertion rather than positive evidence.</p> <p>\u201cIt is deeply concerning that since the military intervention in Yemen, the UK government has approved substantial increases in arm licences to Saudi Arabia on the very items which could be used in an aerial campaign.\u201d </p> <p>The draft also accuses the government of giving contradictory assurances about the unprecedented degree of UK involvement in providing military advice to the Saudis, including in the joint combined planning cell and the Saudi Air Operations Centre. Amendments due to be discussed on Wednesday also contained sharp criticisms for ministers providing contradictory assurances that had subsequently to be corrected.</p> <p>Blunt, demanding an inquiry into the leak by the privileges committee, added that since no criminal offence had occurred, and the police could not therefore be called in, it should be open for the committee to call in private investigators.</p> <p>These investigators, he said, \u201cwould have the capacity to interrogate the electronic records, including deleted emails of potential sources of this confidential and private consideration of select committees, in this instance of the greatest seriousness involving life-and-death issues and the employment of tens of thousands of our fellow citizens\u201d. He added: \u201cI cannot recall an example of such deliberate and repeated leaking of information in our time in the house.\u201d</p> <p>On BBC Newsnight, Blunt refused to respond when he was challenged that he walked out of the committee meeting because he knew that if he did not there would be a quorum and his efforts to dilute the report would be defeated.</p>",

First, Hewlett-Packard\u2019s $11bn purchase of Cambridge-based Autonomy in 2011 was the deal that precipitated crises and write-offs at the US firm. The litigation continues, so best for Micro Focus to ensure it has the right legal protections in place and skirt around the contested claims.</p> <p>Second, old Autonomy is unrecognisable today. Many of its products for searching unstructured data have been incorporated into HPE\u2019s software offering. The Autonomy-related stuff represents only about a fifth of HPE\u2019s software division.</p> <p>Third, it would be misleading for Micro Focus to invoke the thrills and spills of the Autonomy era. Its own style is as dull as its name. Micro Focus occupies the unglamorous end of the technology industry, where the money is made by managing and updating legacy infrastructure. It is a fix-it merchant rather than a pioneer.</p> <p>There\u2019s no shame in that, of course, especially when your recent record is as impressive as Micro Focus\u2019s: the share price was 300p in 2011 and is \u00a322 now, up 15% on Thursday as investors applauded the swoop on a chunk of HPE.</p> <p>Enthusiasm is the right reaction if you believe scrutiny under the Micro Focus lens can turn profit margins at the business from 21% to 46% within three years. That\u2019s the promise from executive chairman Kevin Loosemore, who can point to similar surgery performed on past acquisitions.</p> <p>The difference this time is size. Micro Focus is grabbing control of a business bigger than itself. It is a \u00a35bn ($7bn) company making a $8.8bn deal. The complexities will inevitably be greater, but let\u2019s not knock the ambition. Loosemore and co have earned the right to play on a global stage and, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/30/arm-shareholders-softbank-takeover-tech-lord-myners\">after the dispiriting sale of ARM Holdings to SoftBank for \u00a324bn</a>, it\u2019s good that a UK tech company can step up. A dull, but very worthy, deal.</p> <h2>Osborne\u2019s grand folly HS2 could be hitting the skids </h2> <p>\u201cOften it is modest, rapidly deliverable investments that can have the most immediate impact, particularly on the road network, but also in some places on the rail network,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/08/philip-hammond-announces-autumn-budget-statement-for-23-november\">said Philip Hammond on Thursday</a>.</p> <p>Was the chancellor hinting that HS2 will be ditched? Let\u2019s hope so. The economics of the proposed high-speed railway look more grotesque every time the sums are totted up. Nigel Wilson, chief executive of Legal &amp; General, one of the UK\u2019s biggest investors in infrastructure, said the other day that he wouldn\u2019t dispatch a penny to HS2 because it is of \u201clittle economic benefit\u201d. </p> <p>In reply to a follow-up question from the former Labour chancellor Alistair Darling, Hammond said he is a great believer in the \u201cEddington principle\u201d that modest, easily deliverable projects are often the most worthwhile.</p> <p>Sir Rod Eddington, former boss of British Airways, wrote a report in 2006 for Darling, transport secretary at the time. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jun/07/hs2-the-zombie-train-that-refuses-to-die\">Simon Jenkins\u2019 long read on HS2 in this paper in June</a> reminded us what it said: transport policy \u201cneeds to avoid wasting time and money pursuing alluring new super high-speed motorway or rail networks or pursuing <em>grands projets</em> with speculative returns.\u201d</p> <p>Go for it, chancellor: ditch George Osborne\u2019s grand folly.</p> <h2>Time for Sports Direct to spread the profits </h2> <p>One reason why Mike Ashley burns with resentment about the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/09/how-sports-direct-effectively-pays-below-minimum-wage-pay\">exposure of pay and working practices</a> in Sports Direct\u2019s Shirebrook warehouse may be that, in another corner of the business, his bonus arrangements for a couple of thousand permanent staff has been remarkably generous over the years.</p> <p>A few years ago Sports Direct was being lauded for a scheme whereby some employees, mostly in the stores and head office, were scooping tens of thousands of pounds. In 2013, a lucky \u2013 or hard-working \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/jul/18/sports-direct-staff-bonus-profits\">2,000 staff shared a \u00a3100m payout</a> in the form of Sports Direct stock. In total, \u00a3250m has been distributed this way, as Ashley often likes to point out.</p> <p>The contrast between the treatment of permanent staff and those on zero-hours and agency contracts is stark. But, if Ashley is serious about reform, one idea should be obvious: distribute the spoils more evenly.</p> <p>Ashley used to say he wanted Sports Direct to be more like John Lewis (before alighting on Selfridges this week) and the bonus system at the employee-owned department store is worth studying: payments are declared annually as a percentage of salary.</p> <p>To work in practice at Sports Direct, many zero-hours and agency workers would have to join the regular payroll; at the moment, only 5,000 out of 27,000 staff are permanent full- or part-time employees. But, since Ashley says wants to boost the ratio of permanent employees, the stars could align.</p> <p>If Sports Direct was regularly distributing equally, say, 10% of its profits to, say, 20,000 staff, public perceptions might alter. The governance grumbles would still have to addressed, of course. But a fairer company-wide bonus scheme would be a start. Ashley, if he wanted to be outrageously cheeky, could even describe it as the logical extension of his original thinking.</p>",
  "<p>The <a href=\"https://www.raspberrypi.org\" title=\"\">Raspberry Pi</a> was expected to sell around 10,000 units when it was launched in 2012. It has now sold 10m, or, as <a href=\"https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/ten-millionth-raspberry-pi-new-kit/\" title=\"\">the inventor Eben Upton put it</a> with an engineer\u2019s precision, three orders of magnitude more than he was expecting when he started. The Pi is a very small, very cheap computer that is astonishingly powerful. In its minimal form it costs around \u00a330; add a keyboard, a screen, and possibly some extra storage, and it will do everything most people want from a computer except play contemporary video games. It\u2019s designed for a different sort of play: the kind where you make up the game yourself. The Raspberry Pi is a conscious attempt to make a computer that is the opposite of Apple\u2019s exquisitely slick little gadgets, and the world needs both.</p> <p>Nothing on a Raspberry Pi \u201cjust works\u201d. Very little just doesn\u2019t work, either, but all its capabilities require some effort and input from the user. A modern smartphone is a much more powerful computer, as well as being an order of magnitude more expensive, but it is supposed to do only what the maker approves and if it works differently this is normally a sign that it has been taken over by&#xa0;malevolent hackers.</p> <p>The Pi is designed from the start for benevolent hackers. It can be turned into a media centre, an office computer, a firewall, a weather station, a wildlife camera or a drone controller \u2013 with a little programming. That\u2019s the price of a valuable kind of freedom. By contrast, the ideal smartphone has one button, or it may have none at all, while some of the most convenient and powerful computers in our lives, such as those that control our cars, have simply disappeared from view so that most of their users, or dependants, have no idea they exist. The price we pay for convenience is a loss of control and understanding.</p> <p>The Pi represents the opposite philosophy, where control and understanding grow in step with each other, at the cost of inconvenience. And while most people don\u2019t care to know how the magic works, we are all ultimately reliant on those who do. The Pi <a href=\"http://www.techworld.com/personal-tech/raspberry-pi-founder-3609407/\" title=\"\">was deliberately designed</a> to increase their number by making it easy and cheap for children to play with. In fact, many of the millions sold have gone to adults trying to recapture the enraptured state of childhood play. But some, at least, must have caught the imagination of children who would otherwise have seen nothing and moved on.</p> <p>The usual justification for interesting children in programming is utilitarian. The future of the economy will be largely digital, so the more children are comfortable with the manipulation of digital reality the better off we (and they) will be. The real success of the Pi can\u2019t be measured like that.</p> <p>Although it\u2019s designed and built in Britain, the factory is owned by Sony and the chip designers, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/18/tech-giant-arm-holdings-sold-to-japanese-firm-for-24bn\" title=\"\">ARM, by another Japanese company</a>, while the firm that handles the commercial side is now Swiss. But none of this matters very much. What\u2019s really important is that it offers its users the digital equivalent of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2008/aug/30/foodanddrink\" title=\"\">slow food movement</a> and similar attempts to impose a human scale on the modern world.</p> <p>The international digital economy turns ordinary users into sharecroppers, or even into the crop that advertisers harvest. But every Raspberry Pi user has the freedom and dignity of an allotment holder, someone who really owns the products of their labour.</p>",
  "<p>It was boxing ability as much as musical talent that helped Prince Buster become a key figure in the birth of Jamaican ska music. During the mid-1950s Buster, who has died aged 78, sang in a number of small-time bands in the island\u2019s capital, Kingston. But he also had a promising career as a street fighting boxer, and it was his reputation as a quick-witted and assertive gang leader that brought him to the attention of the legendary <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2004/may/06/guardianobituaries.artsobituaries\">Clement \u201cCoxsone\u201d Dodd</a>, operator of the famous Downbeat sound system that travelled the country playing the latest dance records from the United States.</p> <p>Coxsone took Buster on as a security guard-cum-personal helper, and the young man used the experience to learn all he could about the fledgling Jamaican music business.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/sep/08/prince-buster-dies-ska-jamaica-two-tone\">Prince Buster, ska pioneer, dies aged 78</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Propitiously, he had been born \u2013 as Cecil Campbell, the son of a railway worker \u2013 in Orange Street, the central commercial street in Kingston that was to become the heart of the island\u2019s music scene. Known as Buster in his gang-oriented youth because of his middle name Bustamante (after the Jamaican Labour Party leader <a href=\"http://jis.gov.jm/heroes/sir-alexander-bustamante-2/\">Sir Alexander Bustamante</a>), he later took on the nickname Prince for his boxing exploits, and had a natural entrepreneurial flair as well as musical talent and street sense. He left Dodd in the late 1950s to set up a record store, Buster\u2019s Record Shack, and then his own sound system, the Voice of the People.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZC6Ot1MLP0\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/EZC6Ot1MLP0?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>While both ventures were successful, it was his next move \u2013 into the recording studio \u2013 that really left its mark. In 1960 he embarked on a couple of marathon recording sessions with various artists at the studios of the local radio station RJR that were to shift the island\u2019s musical axis away from the all pervasive influence of America. Among those early recordings was a Buster-produced song by the Folkes Brothers called Oh Carolina that became an instant hit in Jamaica. In a typically bold and unheard-of move that was to characterise Buster\u2019s innovative career, he used the Rastafarian percussionist <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0PIT4NsuOA\">Count Ossie</a> for the backing track. But more importantly he also asked the guitarist, Jah Jerry, to emphasize the afterbeat instead of the downbeat. The same radical syncopation was used on many of the other tracks, including classics such as Little Honey, Humpty Dumpty, They Got to Go and Thirty Pieces of Silver. Ska had been born.</p> <p>Most of the singles from those sessions were hits in his homeland, and Buster never looked back. Over an eight-year period he released hundreds of productions on various labels, many of them chronicling the gun happy \u201crude boy\u201d activities of an increasingly violent, newly independent Jamaica. He became rich, living the high life of sharp suits and fast cars, though remaining an aggressive champion of the underdog.</p> <p>As ska slowed down in the mid 60s and turned into <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00ym9n4\">rocksteady</a> \u2013 a transition Buster did much to nurture \u2013 he set Jamaica alight with a series of records featuring his mythical character Judge Dread, a super-tough magistrate who handed out ridiculously long sentences to recalcitrant rude boys.</p> <p>But his influence went far beyond Jamaica. Many of his own compositions, as well as those he produced, were released on the seminal <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/dec/15/label-of-love-blue-beat?INTCMP=ILCNETTXT3487\">Blue Beat</a> label in the UK, where ska became the music of choice for many mods and skinheads.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDfvXrMnJu0\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/DDfvXrMnJu0?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>The first Jamaican solo hit in the British top 20 was Millie Small\u2019s My Boy Lollipop, in 1964. Buster\u2019s Al Capone in 1967 was the second: he toured the country regularly to sell-out crowds, and in 1964 appeared on Ready Steady Go. It was also in Britain that he converted to Islam and changed his name to Mohammed Yusef Ali after a meeting with the boxer Muhammad Ali.</p> <p>As the 60s drew to a close, Buster moved with the times to produce records for some of the new breed of Jamaican DJs, including <a href=\"http://www.allmusic.com/artist/big-youth-mn0000762652\">Big Youth</a>, and continued to work with well-known artists such as <a href=\"http://www.allmusic.com/artist/dennis-brown-mn0000242861\">Dennis Brown</a>. He even ventured into early dub music.</p> <p>But by the early 1970s, when rock steady was transmogrifying into roots reggae, Buster\u2019s influence and interest began to wane \u2013 partly because as a Muslim he found it difficult to move along with the Rasta-influenced tide. He moved to Miami to pursue various business interests, including the running of a jukebox company he had set up.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3DAHAPLaVI\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/D3DAHAPLaVI?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>His influence did, however, resurface in the late 1970s, when his music was the key inspiration for the ska revival in Britain. In 1978 a London band called Morris and the Minors renamed themselves <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/madness\">Madness</a> after Buster\u2019s classic song Madness is Gladness, and in 1979 their first single, The Prince, went straight into the top 20. The band later reached number seven with a reworking of the Buster song One Step Beyond.</p> <p>Their hero resisted a comeback then, but did reappear onstage in the late 1980s and 1990s, and toured Japan with ska legends the Skatalites as his backing group. He even recorded again in 1992, and in 1998 re-entered the British charts for the first time in 31 years with a new version of an old song, Whine and Grind. Essentially, though, his comeback was low key.</p> <p>In 2001 Buster was awarded the Order of Distinction in Jamaica for his contribution to the development of the country\u2019s music industry. He had long since received countless accolades from his peers, but it was nonetheless fitting recognition for a man whose self-proclaimed title as King of Ska was never seriously disputed. </p> <p>He is survived by his wife, Mola Ali, and children.</p> <ul> <li>Prince Buster, musician, born 24 May 1938; died 8 September 2016<br></li> <li>This article was amended on 12 September 2016. Prince Buster\u2019s Al Capone was a UK hit in 1967 rather than 1965, and it was not the first hit in the British top 20 by a solo Jamaican artist; that was Millie Small\u2019s My Boy Lollipop, in 1964.

We set off to his local shops armed with the list from the school of all that was required. It was a very reasonable list and we spent a happy couple of days gathering the stuff together. However, it cost me over \u00a3300 \u2013, which is a lot of money for a family to find. There may be cheaper shops than the ones we went to but better-quality clothes last longer and can be handed down so are almost always better value.

His thesis is that cash payments aid and abet the underground economy and that we should gradually curtail them in favour of alternative electronic payment systems.</p> <p>More than a dozen countries have imposed restrictions on cash payments but until now, no evaluation of the effectiveness of these measures has ever been undertaken. There does not appear to be any correlation between the size of the shadow economy and the adoption of restrictions.</p> <p>As Rogoff himself acknowledges, scaling back paper currency would hardly end criminal activity or tax evasion. The vast majority of cash transactions are perfectly legitimate, while the vast majority of cash users are law-abiding citizens. Making life just that little bit harder for a handful of criminals at the expense of millions of law-abiding citizens would be the ultimate example of taking a sledgehammer to crack a nut.</p> <p>Cash is fundamentally about freedom. As the German central banker Carl-Ludwig Thiele observed, abolishing cash would hurt consumer sovereignty. Do we really want the state to collude with large financial institutions to know every single detail about how we spend our money and where?</p> <p>Moreover, curtailing cash payments in favour of alternative electronic payment systems would also have far-reaching social consequences. In terms of financial inclusion, restricting cash would disproportionately affect the most vulnerable in society, including young, elderly and infirm people.</p> <p>At a time when cash in circulation is increasing, along with the value of ATM transactions, it seems illogical of Rogoff and others to wish to discriminate against it.</p> <p>All of which suggests that cash still has currency, and if not king, it certainly has a prominent seat at the top table of payment methods.<br><strong>Ron Delnevo</strong> <br><em>Executive director Europe, ATM Industry Association</em></p> <p>\u2022 My grandchildren are quite familiar with our daily milk deliveries by Tony in his float (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/06/northerners-can-do-their-own-gentrifying\" title=\"\">Letters</a>, 7 September).

  "<p>Ferguson protest leader Darren Seals was found dead early Tuesday morning in a car that had been set on fire. Seals had been shot, and St Louis County police said they were investigating his death as a homicide.<br></p> <p>The 29-year-old\u2019s death sent waves of shock and grief through the community of activists in Missouri who protested the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/michael-brown-shooting\">police killing of unarmed black teenager Michael Brown</a> in Ferguson in 2014. </p> <p>\u201cWe have lost a great champion of civil rights in our community,\u201d said Bassem Masri, a friend who had live-streamed the Ferguson protests, sometimes with Seals walking behind him to protect him as he filmed. </p> <p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t go out to the national level like many of the organizers.

Anything going on over here?\u2019\u201d </p> <p>Seals was at the center of key moments of the Ferguson protest, including embracing Brown\u2019s mother on top of a car as she mourned the grand jury decision not to indict Wilson.</p> <p>\u201cShe literally cried in my arms \u2013 it was like I felt her soul crying,\u201d he told MTV News. \u201cIt\u2019s a different type of crying. I\u2019ve seen people crying, but she was really hurt. And it hurt me. It hurt all of us.\u201d </p> <p>Seals was also the activist who quietly but firmly confronted police union official Jeff Roorda for wearing a bracelet that said \u201cI am Darren Wilson\u201d at a city meeting. </p> <p>Roorda said that confrontation was a \u201cmature conversation\u201d and called Seals\u2019 death a tragedy. </p> <p>\u201cHe was not hateful,\u201d Roorda said. \u201cHe was angry about what he thought was going on in the world around him and he was passionate about that,\u201d Roorda said.</p> <p>\u201cA lot of the protesters were very mean and hateful and disrespectful, and he was not.\u201d </p> <p>Russell, another protest leader, said Seals had not gotten enough credit for his work supporting the early stages of the Ferguson protest, setting the tone, making sure people got the protest, and making sure they were fed. He recalled one meeting early on with a small group of young men, some of them gang members, who were furious at being teargassed for the first time in their lives.</p> <p>They wanted to know if they could go on the offensive and attack the police. Seals told them he did not want any of their people to get killed. \u201cYou have to fight back another way,\u201d Seals told them, and helped them prepare for the teargas and rubber bullets by wearing gloves, bandanas and other protective gear. </p> <p>\u201cHe had street credibility that other people in the room didn\u2019t have,\u201d Russell said. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"da091e6d88034e0e12b48a4fa9cf4d5dbdd818d2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/da091e6d88034e0e12b48a4fa9cf4d5dbdd818d2/87_0_2277_1366/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Darren Seals stands behind Lezley McSpadden, the mother of Michael Brown, in front of the Ferguson police station as they learn that Darren Wilson would not be indicted.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Darren Seals stands behind Lezley McSpadden, the mother of Michael Brown, in front of the Ferguson police station as they learn that Darren Wilson would not be indicted.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Robert Cohen/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Two weeks after Brown\u2019s death, Seals and his fellow activists held a food drive and event for families at Canfield Green, where Brown was killed. That Christmas, they held an event giving gifts to local kids in need dubbed Hood Santa. </p> <p>Seals lifted the energy of protests he attended, Rose said. Last year, after a protest, a group of activists were waiting together in a jail cell, Rose said. He couldn\u2019t see because he had been pepper-sprayed, but the door opened and suddenly he heard Seals\u2019 voice. </p> <p>\u201cHe said something like: \u2018I shoulda known I\u2019d run into you people in a place like this,\u2019\u201d Rose said. </p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s the only person I know who can walk into a jail cell of people attacked by the police and sitting here in pain and make us all bust out laughing.\u201d </p> <p>Seals had not been at the protest. But he was often hassled by the police, Rose said, and he had been brought in that time on what Rose remembered as an outstanding warrant for a traffic violation. </p> <p>Russell said Seals had grown up \u201cin the hood\u201d. His father had been incarcerated. \u201cHe was a street guy who changed his life around. He wasn\u2019t a killer or nothing like that, but he\u2019d been out there, around killers, and he survived that. To have survived that and to be brutally shot and burned to death, I mean, and burned ... \u201d he broke off.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s easy to kill black people because we\u2019re the have-nots,\u201d Seals told MTV News after the grand jury did not indict Darren Wilson. \u201cWe\u2019re at the bottom of the totem pole. What people don\u2019t understand is, we actually live in a nightmare. We actually live in a place where gunshots [are normal]. We hear gunshots every day.</p> <p>\u201cWe plan to rally more and protest more, but the long-term goal: We\u2019re trying to use all the resources we gained from this to educate people, because we all know the system will never change.\u201d</p> <h2>Splintered activism</h2> <p>Seals was a controversial figure in the police accountability movement. \u201cHe had and has a lot of views that many people regard to be sexist, misogynist and homophobic,\u201d said Bynes, the protester and former committeewoman. \u201cMany people felt like he spewed hate.\u201d </p> <p>In a Twitter post last year, Seals wrote: \u201c<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/BlackLivesMatter?src=hash\">#BlackLivesMatter</a> is a gay/feminist movement not a black movement they are not \u2018leaders\u2019 they\u2019re thieves who exploited the work of black ppl.\u201d </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>He was not hateful.

  "<p>I am disappointed that, in her desire to paint Nick Clegg in the worst light, Susan Talbot (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/06/nick-clegg-should-hang-his-head-in-shame\" title=\"\">Letters</a>, 7 September) does not give the whole story about her daughter\u2019s student debt. She sets out the total debt of \u00a353,817 but fails to inform readers that her daughter did not have to pay anything for tuition fees during the years of her studies and, with annual earnings of \u00a39,964, she will not have to pay a penny off the loan until she is earning more than twice this figure. Even then the payment is relatively small. Finally Ms Talbot says that the state should \u201cwrite off the debts\u201d. But,&#xa0;in fact, any debt remaining after 30&#xa0;years is written off.</p> <p>What matters far more than the amount of tuition fees is what the student has to pay during and after his or her studies.

It does not help rebuild the party when commentators ignore the many members like myself who were never happy with Nick Clegg\u2019s leadership, and write us all off as if we were uncritical fans of him.</p> <p>When she says \u201csocial equality is not in their DNA\u201d she ignores that phrase, taken from the Liberal party\u2019s constitution as the core of what we are about: \u201cNone shall be enslaved by poverty, ignorance or conformity.\u201d I was one of those Liberals who fought for that phrase to be maintained in the merged party\u2019s constitution against the SDP (membership including Polly Toynbee), who considered it a mark of the lefty Liberals they disliked.</p> <p>I argued against electing Clegg as leader, both because he showed a clear bias toward the economic right of the party, and because he had little experience of grassroots campaigning.</p> <p>The media consistently ignored our points, and pushed Clegg as \u201cobviously the next leader of the Lib Dems\u201d because they seemed to think that someone with his sort of elite background was obviously superior to anyone who had risen through the ranks of the party.

  "<p>Credit card group MasterCard is being sued for \u00a314bn, the largest legal claim in British history, in a landmark lawsuit over allegations that it overcharged 46m UK consumers.</p> <p>The claim, which MasterCard said it would oppose vigorously, is the first major case under a new framework for class action lawsuits on behalf of multiple claimants. It revolves around fees imposed by MasterCard on businesses that accepted its debit and credit cards between 1992 and 2008.</p> <p>Law firm Quinn Emanuel, which filed the suit at the Competition Appeal Tribunal, alleges that these charges \u2013 known as \u201cinterchange fees\u201d \u2013 were set at an unlawfully high level and pushed up prices for British consumers.</p> <p>The claim was brought by Walter Merricks, the UK\u2019s former chief financial services ombudsman, on behalf of around 46m consumers he claims have lost out.</p> <p>It follows a 10-year legal battle between MasterCard and the European commission that ended in 2014 with the European court of justice concluding that the credit card firm\u2019s fees for cross-border transactions were too high.</p> <p>In a <a href=\"http://www.quinnemanuel.com/the-firm/news-events/firm-news-14-billion-damages-claim-filed-against-mastercard-by-uk-consumers-in-landmark-collective-action\">long statement on its website</a>, the law firm said MasterCard has spurned a chance to settle with the commission, instead of choosing to fight its case through the courts.</p> <p>\u201cMasterCard lost this battle at every level and showed complete disregard for its cardholders and consumers at large, focusing instead on generating unlawful profits,\u201d Quinn Emanuel said in a statement.</p> <p>Merricks, who spent 10 years in charge of oversight of British financial firms, said: \u201cThe filing of this claim is the first step towards consumers obtaining compensation for what MasterCard did.</p> <p>\u201cMasterCard charged billions of pounds of unlawfully high fees for its sole benefit and to the detriment of consumers. It has already been found to have broken competition law, the basis of which was to protect consumers, and that cannot be disputed.</p> <p>\u201cThere is no basis upon which MasterCard can contend that its card fees were not unlawful.\u201d</p> <p>He said that because MasterCard\u2019s fees had already been ruled unlawful in the European court, the claim need only prove that consumers suffered losses as a result.</p> <p>Under the UK\u2019s framework for lawsuits on behalf of multiple people, which was overhauled in the Consumer Rights Act of 2015, anyone who lost out is automatically eligible for compensation unless they opt out explicitly.</p> <p>Boris Bronfentrinker, a Quinn Emanuel partner, said: \u201cDespite criticising this action publicly in July and further insulting consumers by referring to the UK\u2019s new collective action regime as \u2018unfortunate\u2019, MasterCard has since turned over evidence [witness statements and expert reports] that allows us, even at this early stage, to robustly value the claim at \u00a314bn.</p> <p>\u201cThey are now preparing for a tough legal battle which we estimate will go to trial in 2018 unless they are prepared to make UK consumers a fair settlement offer before then.\u201d</p> <p>He said MasterCard had made \u201cno effort\u201d to compensate consumers who lost out, despite acknowledging that the fees had been passed on to them.</p> <p>\u201cIt is not clear how MasterCard can now turn around and argue the opposite to prevent our case from succeeding,\u201d he added.</p> <p>MasterCard said: \u201cNow that the claim has been filed, we will take time to review it in detail, however we continue to firmly disagree with the basis of this claim and we intend to oppose it vigorously.</p> <p> \u201cWe deliver real value through the benefits of security, convenience and consumer protection, and we are committed to investing in our payment services in order to continue to meet the rapidly evolving needs of all our customers.\u201d</p> <p>In a <a href=\"https://newsroom.mastercard.com/eu/2016/09/08/consumer-collective-action-mastercards-view/\">separate blog post</a>, the company said interchange fees are good for consumers and said similar cases in the US had been thrown out of court. Interchange fees are paid by a retailer\u2019s bank to the bank that issued a credit card used in any transaction. The retailer\u2019s bank then charges the retailer to cover its cost. The fees are fixed by credit card companies and are often incorporated into the prices that shops then charge consumers.</p> <p>Funds linked with Chicago-based Gerchen Keller Capital, the world\u2019s largest litigation funder, will provide up to \u00a340m to fund the litigation.</p> <p>There has been one previous case under the new rules on collective action lawsuits, on behalf of pensioners who claim they paid too much for their mobility scooters. But the case against MasterCard is the first to test rules intended to allow suits on behalf of vast numbers of claimants.</p>",

The organisation <a href=\"http://www.fairdealforexpats.com/news.html\">Fair Deal for Expats </a>is planning to launch its action at the EU\u2019s general court in Luxembourg in an attempt to bolster Britain\u2019s bargaining position in preliminary political discussions over withdrawal.</p> <p>Several days after the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/24/eu-referendum-result-what-we-know-so-far\">23 June referendum result</a>, Juncker announced that he was making a \u201cpresidential order\u201d that there should be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/26/eu-may-refuse-informal-brexit-talks-until-uk-triggers-article-50\">no negotiations with the UK</a> until <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/25/article-50-brexit-debate-britain-eu\">Article 50</a> \u2013 formally signalling Britain\u2019s intention to withdraw \u2013 has been triggered. By forcing the UK to wait until it has pressed the button on Article 50, many believe Juncker has restricted its room for diplomatic manoeuvre.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/25/article-50-brexit-debate-britain-eu\">What is article 50 and why is it so central to the Brexit debate?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The legal action is supported by some of the 1.2 million Britons who live abroad in other EU countries. Many expatriates fear that they will lose economic and welfare rights under Brexit. Their claim is being financed through <a href=\"https://www.crowdjustice.co.uk/case/brexit-challenge-junker/\">a crowdfunding website</a>.</p> <p>In <a href=\"http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_SPEECH-16-2353_en.htm\">his speech on 28 June, Juncker</a> said: \u201cI have forbidden Commissioners from holding discussions with representatives from the British government \u2013 by presidential order, which is not my style. I have told all the directors-general that there cannot be any prior discussions with British representatives. No notification, no negotiation<em>.\u201d </em>The European Union has dismissed the challenge, saying that the decision not to negotiate until Article 50 has been triggered is an agreement between the other 27 remaining EU states.</p> <p>Fair Deal for Expats is also intervening in the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/19/government-awaits-first-legal-opposition-to-brexit-in-high-court\">forthcoming judicial review in London, </a>due to take place in October, which is seeking to give parliament \u2013 as opposed to the prime minister \u2013 sole authority to trigger Article 50.</p> <p> John Shaw, a spokesman for Fair Deal for Expats, which is represented by the Cheltenham law firm Croft Solicitors, said: \u201cPeople in Britain and across Europe have become accustomed to Mr Juncker\u2019s antagonistic style and bombastic rhetoric. But his dictatorial-style bullying tactics will not be tolerated. Enough is enough.</p> <p>\u201cMr Juncker is urging Britain to trigger Article 50 sooner rather than later, but he\u2019s not entitled to issue edicts preventing the UK from having discussions with the commission. He\u2019s forgetting that the UK is still a member state.\u201d <br></p> <p>Patrick Green QC and Henry Warwick, barristers working on the claim, will argue that there is no such thing as a \u201cpresidential order\u201d and that either it has no legal force to stop commission staff entering into talks or else it is an abuse of Juncker\u2019s powers. Juncker, it is alleged, is preventing the UK from exercising its rights to begin discussions until British diplomats are at a diplomatic disadvantage.<br></p> <p>Fair Deal for Expats said: \u201cThe purpose of the challenge is to allow the UK to negotiate freely with the European commission before Article 50 is triggered, so that the outline terms of the UK\u2019s withdrawal from the EU can be agreed in everyone\u2019s interests and as soon as possible.\u201d </p> <p>The organisation argues that Juncker is in contravention of the \u201cprinciple of sincere cooperation that the commission is required to abide by\u201d, that his order has no proper basis in law, and that it discriminates against the UK and its people, who remain EU citizens. </p> <p>The EU commission has claimed, according to Fair Deal for Expats, that the Juncker statement has been mistranslated. Juncker\u2019s use of the phrase \u201cpresidential order\u201d has also been described as a loose figure of speech.<br></p> <p>A statement issued by the European commission said: \u201cPresident Juncker, the president of the European council, Donald Tusk, the European parliament president, Martin Schulz, and a series of national leaders have all made clear that the legal ground for exiting the EU is Article 50 of the treaty and that negotiations begin after that is triggered. President Juncker has instructed commissioners and EC officials also to follow that principle.\u201d Juncker\u2019s comments were only intended to bind commission officials not other EU member states.</p>",

The regions will elect mayors in May 2017.</p> <p>Ross Smith, of the North-East Chamber of Commerce, said: \u201cWe\u2019re at a loss to understand why, after a year of negotiations, it\u2019s not been possible to strike a deal. It\u2019s extremely disappointing and bad news for the north-east and UK economy. We sincerely hope something can be salvaged and will play whatever part we can to help. </p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s positive that a deal is going forward in Tees Valley though, and we look forward to continuing our constructive relationship with the combined authority there as that\u2019s implemented.\u201d<br></p> <p>Alexandra Jones, chief executive of the thinktank Centre for Cities, said Newcastle could break away from its north-east neighbours and seek a \u201cNewcastle city region\u201d devolution deal similar to the Liverpool model.</p> <p>She added: \u201cIt is disappointing that the devolution deal for the north-east will definitely not go ahead as planned, as it had the potential to boost the region\u2019s long-term economic prospects.</p> <p>\u201cBut this should not signal the end of devolution in the north-east, and Sajid Javid has left the door open for powers to be devolved on a different basis to areas within the region. </p> <p>\u201cWhile that it is very unlikely to happen in time for May 2017, when the original deal was due to come into place, national and local leaders should now work together to explore different options, and to ensure that devolution in the north-east does not come to a standstill.\u201d</p> <p>Paul Watson, the leader of the group of seven north-east councils, said it was \u201cvery disappointing that the government has chosen to end current discussions over north-east devolution in this way\u201d.</p> <p>He said that each council had repeatedly stated their commitment to devolution and added: \u201cAlthough we were not able to reach a majority agreement to proceed to public consultation at this present time, we have reaffirmed our commitment to working together with the government to achieve the right devolution deal for our region.<br></p> <p>\u201cLeaders in the north-east will continue to fight for our region, to build our economy and create jobs and investment.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>David Bossie, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/03/citizens-united-david-bossie-trump-campaign\">new deputy campaign manager</a> for Donald Trump, was probably hoping \u2013 at best \u2013 that his 2008 anti-Hillary Clinton campaign commercial-cum-documentary Hillary: The Movie would put a fork in Clinton\u2019s political ambitions.</p> <p>Little did he know it would result in a major US supreme court ruling that would overturn years of campaign finance law, usher in an age of unlimited and undisclosed campaign spending and ultimately become a wedge issue between Clinton, during her second campaign, and the candidate running for the Democratic nomination \u2013 to her left. (Or that the 2016 Republican nominee and his eventual boss would also rail against the Super Pacs it helped spawn.)</p> <p>The movie itself, however, was largely ignored during its initial release, in part because of its amateurish production values, its line-up of mostly obscure conservative talking heads and its lightly factual, non-chronological look through <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/27/hillary-clinton-bill-clinton-scandals\">the scandals of the Clinton years</a> (some of which didn\u2019t even involve Hillary Clinton) that many Americans had tired of years before.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/27/hillary-clinton-bill-clinton-scandals\">Travelgate to Furnituregate: a guide to the Clinton scandals of the 90s</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But as former press secretary for Newt Gingrich turned Washington Times editorial page editor Tony Blankley (who <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/09/us/politics/tony-blankley-gingrich-aide-and-columnist-dies-at-63.html\">died in 2012</a>) noted in the movie, some politicians \u201csay what you need to say at any given moment, and rely on the lack of memory of the American public and the support of the mainstream media to support that lack of memory\u201d. Though Blankley, of course, was referring to the Clintons, similar criticisms have been leveled at her Republican opponent and film-maker Bossie\u2019s new employer. </p> <p>So what could Bossie pull out of his hat that hasn\u2019t yet been thrown at Clinton during this campaign?</p> <p>It\u2019s perhaps easier to look first at what has been ineffective in 2016. Calling her \u201cone of the most divisive figures in America\u201d, as the voiceover in the film does, is certainly not an effective criticism when her opponent is the equally divisive Donald Trump. Nor is Ann Coulter\u2019s assertion that \u201cany Republican with those numbers of character flaws, with that sort of behavioral problem and psychopathic psychology could not run or be elected dog catcher if it were a Republican\u201d.</p> <p>Attacking her problems, or Bill Clinton\u2019s problems, with ineligible or unethical campaign donors and the potential ties to a foreign power, such as China, seeking to influence the US election is certain to raise too many uncomfortable questions, given the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/30/donald-trump-paul-manafort-ukraine-russia-putin-ties\">appearance of a cozy relationship</a> between parts of the Trump campaign and Russia, and some of the people (like white supremacists) supporting him. Dick Morris\u2019s assertion that Clinton didn\u2019t pass enough far-reaching legislation during her tenure in the Senate isn\u2019t useful when your candidate is a political neophyte who\u2019s never been elected to office and makes that part of his supposed allure.</p> <p>Travelgate, which gets extensive \u2013 if slightly inaccurate \u2013 treatment in the film, is likely too obscure a scandal for most people in 2016; Hillarycare, though still a conservative bugaboo, is now the law of the land and <a href=\"http://kff.org/interactive/kaiser-health-tracking-poll-the-publics-views-on-the-aca/#?response=Favorable--Unfavorable&amp;aRange=twoYear\">about as many people</a> approve as disapprove it. And although the film criticizes her for her lack of support for the Iraq war, particularly in its later years, Trump has criticized her for supporting it at all (although he reserves the right to change his own mind).</p> <p>More effective \u2013 and more dirty \u2013 are assertions about the Clintons\u2019 marriage, included unsubstantiated but continuing allegations that she personally hired private investigators to dig up dirt on and intimidate women who had had contact with Bill Clinton and accused him of affairs or assault. (The Clintons have long denied these claims.) Given Trump\u2019s willingness to invite questions about his own less-than-squeaky-clean marital history by alleging that it\u2019s fair to ask Hillary Clinton questions about Bill Clinton\u2019s behavior, it seems likely that Bossie\u2019s background with Clinton accuser Kathleen Willey \u2013 who <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/268590-bill-clinton-sexual-assault-accuser-to-campaign-against\">alleged</a> that Bill Clinton groped her in the Oval Office and that Hillary Clinton <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2008/01/did-clintons-try-whack-cat\">had her pet cat killed</a> \u2013 and Jared K Stern \u2013 the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.bethesdamagazine.com/Bethesda-Magazine/July-August-2012/Sex-Lies-Videotape/\">private investigator</a> who says he was hired to follow Willey in 1998 \u2013 will come into play before the election season is over.</p> <p>Most interesting, though, is the last major anecdote of the Bossie film: he uses the story of Joe Connor \u2013 whose father, Frank, was killed in the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/manhattan/puerto-rican-terrorists-plant-bomb-tavern-1975-article-1.2484977\">Puerto Rican separatist group FALN\u2019s bombing of the Fraunces Tavern</a> in New York City in 1974 \u2013 to highlight Bill Clinton\u2019s <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1999/09/08/us/12-imprisoned-puerto-ricans-accept-clemency-conditions.html?pagewanted=all\">granting clemency</a> to 12 members of the organization in 1999.

Still, the move by the White House was widely seen as an attempt to help her curry favor with the large (and voter-rich) Puerto Rican community in New York City \u2013 though her subsequent denouncement of the offer did her no favors.</p> <p>Connor is <a href=\"http://thenewfounders.net/joseph-f-connor/\">an occasional Fox News guest</a> and a columnist on the conservative site TownHall, where he <a href=\"http://townhall.com/columnists/joeconnor/2015/12/22/hillary-not-qualified-to-win-war-on-terror-n2096386\">has</a> <a href=\"http://townhall.com/columnists/joeconnor/2016/09/04/flight-to-terror-n2213667\">inveighed</a> against electing Hillary Clinton.

  "<p>The Scottish government\u2019s controversial \u201cnamed person\u201d scheme for supporting children has been delayed for a year after the supreme court ruled that data sharing provisions were in breach of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/human-rights\">human rights</a>.<br></p> <p>In a statement to the Holyrood parliament on Thursday, the Scottish education secretary, John Swinney, said he hoped the scheme, which has been dubbed a snooper\u2019s charter by family rights campaigners, could be implemented by August 2017, twelve months after originally planned. Swinney said this would follow a period of \u201cintense engagement\u201d on necessary amendments, including with young people themselves.</p> <p>The scheme, which is part of the SNP government\u2019s flagship <a href=\"http://www.gov.scot/Topics/People/Young-People/gettingitright\">getting it right for every child</a> framework, provides children with access to a named person such as a health worker or teacher who acts as a single point of contact. It aims to help parents access services and to identify those children in need of protection. But critics fear it erodes parental rights and will detract from targeted interventions for high-risk children.</p> <p>The supreme court ruled in July that the scheme\u2019s information-sharing provisions risked breaching <a href=\"https://www.liberty-human-rights.org.uk/human-rights/what-are-human-rights/human-rights-act/article-8-right-private-and-family-life\">article 8 rights</a> to privacy and a family life under the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2014/oct/03/what-is-european-convention-on-human-rights-echr\">European convention on human rights</a>, but said it recognised the aims of the scheme were \u201cunquestionably legitimate and benign\u201d.</p> <p>Swinney told the chamber: \u201cWe recognise that information-sharing has been an important issue for practitioners and the public alike. We want to ensure that there is a clear consensus across Scotland on how information-sharing should operate. That must include the essential principle of consent, and the rare occasions when it is not appropriate to require or seek it.\u201d</p> <p>He said his government would undertake \u201ca three month period of intense engagement\u201d, with input from practitioners, parents, charities and young people.</p> <p>The supreme court challenge was brought by the NO2NP campaign, a coalition which includes the Christian Institute, Care (Christian Action Research and Education) and the Family Education Trust. </p> <p>Describing Swinney\u2019s statement as laughable, campaign spokesman Simon Calvert said: \u201cWhatever [Swinney] may claim, the named person scheme he ends up with in a year\u2019s time will be very different from the policy he wanted. Instead of focusing on saving face, the government should be apologising to parents for ignoring their human rights.\u201d</p> <p>However, director of <a href=\"http://www.barnardos.org.uk/scotland.htm\">Barnardo\u2019s Scotland</a>, Martin Crewe, welcomed the announcement, and in particular the Scottish government\u2019s intention to develop a code of practice on the information-sharing provisions within the scheme. </p>",

In a very funny film, Mortensen\u2019s grizzled deadpan may be the funniest thing of all.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c0f2b0297a931eb28489ae5b82b91a3ab11aebdb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c0f2b0297a931eb28489ae5b82b91a3ab11aebdb/0_114_2496_1497/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Viggo Mortensen with George MacKay, Nicholas Hamilton, Annalise Basso and Samantha Isler in Captain Fantastic.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Viggo Mortensen with George MacKay, Nicholas Hamilton, Annalise Basso and Samantha Isler in Captain Fantastic.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Everett/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cReally,\u201d he says, \u201cthere\u2019s no plan to what I do beyond finding movies people might still like in 10 years.\u201d But fatherhood keeps turning up. Aside from A History of Violence, there was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/jan/07/the-road-review\">The Road</a>, the adaptation of Cormac McCarthy\u2019s novel of a father and son in a grey post-apocalyptic world. Mortensen has an adult son \u2013 Henry, a documentary-maker \u2013 from his former marriage to <a href=\"http://www.exenecervenka.net/\">Exene Cervenka</a>, singer in LA punk band X. \u201cParenting is humbling. You vow to not make the same mistakes your parents made, and then inevitably, there you are.\u201d</p> <p>Mortensen speaks calmly, on the edge of quiet. \u201cThe way the family is portrayed in movies is often binary. You either have the happy family or total dysfunction, where you watch and say: \u2018Oh, they were so fucked up, I was so moved.\u2019 The reality is happiness <em>and</em> dysfunction. But that\u2019s less comfortable to sell.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In the movies you either have the happy family or total dysfunction. The reality is happiness and dysfunction</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The politics of his character in Captain Fantastic are not a world from his own. On the first day of filming, he arrived with his canoe and a stack of his own books to fill the family library: Quebecois poetry, Howard Zinn\u2019s A People\u2019s History of American Empire. But nothing is simple. Despite their Marxism, he says Donald Trump would approve of the Cashes for their insularity. The family can become a bubble, a retreat from the world. I tell him this reminds me of the infamous Margaret Thatcher speech about there being <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-10377842\">no such thing as society</a>, just individuals and families. \u201cRight, I remember Thatcher saying that, using the idea of the family to attack the welfare state. Promoting self-sufficiency to eliminate investment in public projects.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"48285bde821b55af7bc14f6e5c92701763f5c22f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/48285bde821b55af7bc14f6e5c92701763f5c22f/0_5_512_307/500.jpg\" alt=\"Mortensen in Eastern Promises, 2007.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mortensen in Eastern Promises, 2007.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC FILMS/Sportsphoto Ltd./Allstar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On movies, Mortensen can tend towards the businesslike. Talking politics, he could go all day. \u201cIt was the same credo with Reagan, supported by the media, and from there all roads lead to Trump. Shocked editorials ask: \u2018How can this have happened?\u2019 And you think: \u2018Because of you.\u2019 But, of course, it\u2019s more complex than Trump. Do you mind?\u201d I realise he wants to get some air at the window. London churns below as he lists the sacred cows of US politics. \u201cTalk about going to church. Say the military is underfunded. Be seen shooting animals. And the Democrats do all these things.\u201d</p> <p>Mortensen has had an eventful election. An enthused supporter of Bernie Sanders, the selection of Hillary Clinton left him so dispirited he decided to vote for Jill Stein of the Green party. On mentioning this publicly, the response from some fearful of a backdoor Trump victory was raw. The prominent film blogger Sasha Stone <a href=\"http://www.awardsdaily.com/2016/07/17/an-open-letter-to-viggo-mortensen-stop-the-madness-before-its-too-late/\">wrote</a> a 2,000-word open letter: \u201cViggo, I expected you to have compassion and regard for the most vulnerable. As evidenced by your recent words, you clearly don\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>He half-nods. Clinton, he says, is simply dishonest. \u201cI understand the argument that I\u2019m helping Trump. But people said it was a problem in 2000 voting for Ralph Nader and not Al Gore, and that election was stolen by Bush anyway.\u201d He screws up his face.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"714332616e4bdd150ba4bdf3f6d898f086f91a56\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/714332616e4bdd150ba4bdf3f6d898f086f91a56/0_6_3140_1884/1000.jpg\" alt=\"With Maria Bello in A History of Violence, 2005.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With Maria Bello in A History of Violence, 2005.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/NEW LINE CINEMA/Sportsphoto Ltd./Allstar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Nestled in Captain Fantastic is a ticklish idea \u2013 that for all his revolutionary theory, Ben Cash is just another patriarch, the oldest white man in the room. To emphasise that point, Mortensen says, there was briefly a plan to have one of the children be adopted from Latin America. \u201cBut a film can only tell so many stories.\u201d Still, in 2016, aren\u2019t there times when, if you\u2019re leftwing, white and male, you feel the best thing you can do is just let someone else speak? \u201cAgain, I understand that.\u201d He pauses. \u201cThe dangerous thing with this conversation is that one thing gets taken out of context, or is underlined. But I\u2019m not afraid of any question.\u201d</p> <p>Mortensen recalls the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jan/31/captain-fantastic-sundance-2016-first-look-review-viggo-mortensen\">premiere</a> of Captain Fantastic at the Sundance festival in January. Standing on the red carpet, he was asked about the news that the Academy was to expand the diversity of its membership before next year\u2019s Oscars. \u201cAnd I said: \u2018Sounds good. But with the Oscars, you should always follow the money. Terrible decisions are made every year because of the money. Because the Oscars are a racket. Yes, there are black performers and Native Americans, and Asians, and Hispanics who are unfairly excluded from this awards circus, but many white performers are too.\u2019 Then the interview appears and all I\u2019m saying is white actors get unfairly left out. And of course there are all these comments on YouTube about how I\u2019m just a privileged Hollywood white guy. And I thought: \u2018OK \u2013 I should have just said yes.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Mortensen\u2019s film career began with a small part opposite Harrison Ford as an Amish farmer in the thriller <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gjh-y7NQdI8\">Witness</a>. He was 27. Before acting, he had worked as a truck driver, shipyard worker and flower seller, pinballing between Europe and the US. The son of a Danish father and American mother, migration defined his childhood too: from Manhattan to Copenhagen and then Argentina, where his father managed poultry farms, until his parents divorced and at 12 he and his mother ended up in Watertown, so far in upstate New York it was almost Canada. (He now lives in Madrid with his partner, the actor <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ariadna_Gil\">Ariadna Gil</a>). Film work proved a slow burn \u2013 but Witness hinted at an old world aura others finally saw too. Off camera, he became known for the depth of his research. For Eastern Promises, he had his gangster\u2019s dialogue translated into Russian, then checked its authenticity among people who would know while travelling alone through Moscow and St Petersburg. (More prosaically, Captain Fantastic saw him learn the bagpipes.)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0a891c2297cd16d032ddad3ae7a8307022361d47\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0a891c2297cd16d032ddad3ae7a8307022361d47/0_85_3504_2102/1000.jpg\" alt=\"With his partner, the Spanish actor Ariadna Gil, 2006.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With his partner, the Spanish actor Ariadna Gil, 2006.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alessandra Tarantino/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As a parent, research only takes you so far. Before Cervanka had Henry, the couple made plans. \u201cWe looked into diapers. Brain development.\u201d He says he learned how a child really defines itself. Still, he rented Henry cartoons on video to avoid commercials, glowed with pride when he wouldn\u2019t join an ovation for Titanic. \u201cAnd the money I\u2019ve made at times was useful, allowing me to expose him to different cultures.\u201d</p> <p>Henry\u2019s taste would have a seismic impact on his father\u2019s career. In 1999, Peter Jackson was a day from shooting his Lord of the Rings trilogy when he decided he no longer wanted actor Stuart Townsend in the role of Aragorn. Though Mortensen was offered the job, it had limited appeal; Henry, an avid reader of Tolkien, nagged him into accepting. Three films later, a new level of celebrity had engulfed an actor who had previously answered fan mail by hand.</p> <p>For somone so self-sufficient, you wonder how strange the film business has been. I mention that the British actor Mark Strong once told me he had to ask an assistant on a blockbuster to stop trying to put his socks on for him. Mortensen winces. Does big budget film-making infantilise?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8bb87d90382b632400186feee853158ae7fc5f8a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8bb87d90382b632400186feee853158ae7fc5f8a/0_0_512_307/500.jpg\" alt=\"Aragorn in The Lord Of The Rings: The Two Towers (2002).\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Aragorn in The Lord Of The Rings: The Two Towers (2002).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/New Line Cinema</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIt can. But people let themselves be infantilised. And you set the tone as an actor. Young actors see older actors behaving in infantile ways. \u2018I want the biggest trailer. I want to go to the premiere in this country and take my family even though the distributor has to pay for the hotel and it\u2019s going to make it harder for them to buy another movie.\u2019 Having their agent fill their contract with privileges then saying, \u2018Oh, it\u2019s in my contract\u2019, as if they had nothing to do with it. As adults these are not good excuses.\u201d He stretches out his limbs, his voice fractionally louder. \u201cAnd the way you behave on set, how you talk to the crew. A lot of experienced actors choose not to even stay around off camera, or do such a poor job on camera it\u2019s obvious they couldn\u2019t give a fuck what you\u2019re doing. I\u2019ve had to say to an actor in a scene where the focus was on me: \u2018You know, you seem very tired, why don\u2019t you go home? I\u2019d rather just do this with someone from the crew.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI say this without naming names. But it\u2019s just one example of the piggishness.\u201d He keeps going. He\u2019s on a roll. \u201cThen there\u2019s the sense of competition, fuelled by these mushrooming award shows. Accepting jobs because you might get nominated. Trying to win scenes. They\u2019ve decided to cry because it\u2019s going to get them their nomination, and the other actor doesn\u2019t matter a fuck. But that also happens in independent movies. It\u2019s not unique to studio movies. It\u2019s not unique to American movies. I\u2019ve seen that working in London.</p> <p>\u201cA movie only works because people adjust to each other. And if they don\u2019t, well, the philosopher Lao Tzu said that if you don\u2019t change direction \u2026\u201d \u2013 suddenly a huge grin flashes up on his face and for a second gets wider and wider \u2013 \u201c\u2026 then you may just end up where you\u2019re headed.\u201d</p> <p><em>Captain Fantastic is released in the UK 9 September </em></p>",

I did the same thing on the road in hotels.</p> </blockquote> <p>Powell has previously admitted using a laptop on a private line and sending notes to ambassadors and foreign ministers via personal email, according to a report by the state department\u2019s inspector general.<br></p> <p>In the message to Clinton, Powell said the main issue for him was PDAs \u2013 once-popular devices that included Palm Pilots \u2013 that the DSS would not allow into secure spaces. </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>When I asked why not they gave me all kinds of nonsense about how they gave out signals and could be read by spies, etc. Same reason they tried to keep mobile phones out of the suite. I had numerous meetings with them.</p> <p>We even opened one up for them to try to explain to me why it was more dangerous than say, a remote control for one of the many tvs in the suite. Or something embedded in my shoe heel. They never satisfied me and NSA/CIA wouldn\u2019t back off. So, we just went about our business and stopped asking. I had an ancient version of a PDA and used it. In general, the suite was so sealed that it is hard to get signals in or out wirelessly.</p> </blockquote> <p>Powell went on to offer Clinton a friendly warning first reported last week when the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/02/hillary-clinton-emails-laptop-thumb-drive-archive-missing\">FBI released notes of its now closed investigation</a> into her handling of sensitive information. \u201cHowever, there is a real danger. If it is public that you have a BlackBerry and it it [sic] government and you are using it, government or not, to do business, it may become an official record and subject to the law \u2026 Be very careful. I got around it all by not saying much and not using systems that captured the data.\u201d</p> <p>Giving an insight into the routine frustrations of balancing security with convenience, Powell, who was secretary of state under George W Bush, added: \u201cYou will find DS driving you crazy if you let them. They had Maddy [possibly a reference to former secretary Madeleine Albright] tied up in knots. I refused to let them live in my house or build a place on my property. They found an empty garage half a block away.</p> <p>\u201cOn weekends, I drove my beloved cars around town without them following me. I promised I would have a phone and not be gone more than an hour or two at Tysons or the hardware store. They hated it and asked me to sign a letter relieving them of responsibility if I got whacked while doing that. I gladly did.</p> <p>\u201cSpontaneity was my security. They wanted to have two to three guys follow me around the building all the time. I said if they were doing their job guarding the place, they didn\u2019t need to follow me. I relented and let one guy follow me one full corridor behind just so they knew where I was if I was needed immediately. Their job is to keep you hermetically sealed up. Love, Colin.\u201d </p> <p>The email saga has continued to haunt Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign even after the FBI concluded in July that she should not face criminal charges. She was quizzed about it closely during a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/08/clinton-vows-no-more-troops-in-iraq-as-trump-slams-dumbest-foreign-policy\">\u201ccommander-in-chief\u201d forum</a> with military veterans on NBC News on Wednesday night. </p> <p>Cummings said the 2009 exchange showed that Republicans were unfairly critical of Clinton and argued that Powell \u201cadvised Secretary Clinton with a detailed blueprint on how to skirt security rules and bypass requirements to preserve federal records, although Secretary Clinton has made clear that she did not rely on this advice\u201d.</p> <p>It \u201calso illustrates the longstanding problem that no secretary of state ever used an official unclassified email account until the current secretary of state\u201d, Cummings said.</p> <p>The date of the Clinton-Powell email exchange raises questions over Powell\u2019s recent denial of responsibility for providing her advice. \u201cThe truth is she was using it for a year before I sent her a memo telling her what I did,\u201d <a href=\"http://pagesix.com/2016/08/21/colin-powell-sets-record-straight-on-involvement-in-email-scandal/\">he told the New York Post</a>. \u201cHer people have been trying to pin it on me.\u201d</p>",

An uninformed person looking at the picture may have concluded that he was in charge and that the woman beside him (Theresa May) was some sort of aide. His name is<strong> Nick Timothy</strong>, he is May\u2019s co-chief of staff and, on the basis of today\u2019s grammar school news, you could be forgiven for thinking he is running the country.</p> <p>Timothy used to be May\u2019s chief of staff when she was home secretary and during that period he did not have a media profile. But then he left to work as head of the New Schools Network and, during that time, he spoke to the media and wrote a regular (and very good) column for ConservativeHome, which means we know a great deal about what he thinks.</p> <p>Two of the most surprising announcements to come from May since she became prime minister can be directly traced to his thinking. The last-minute decision to delay agreeing the new Hinkley Point nuclear power station? Timothy set out the thinking behind that in a ConservativeHome column last October, <a href=\"http://www.conservativehome.com/thecolumnists/2015/10/nick-timothy-the-government-is-selling-our-national-security-to-china.html\">The Government is selling our national security to China.</a> And extending grammar schools? Timothy proposed exactly that in <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/educationnews/11981856/Nick-Timothy-end-ban-on-new-grammar-schools.html\">an interview with the Daily Telegraph last November.</a></p> <p>So what else in on Timothy\u2019s agenda? Here are five policies that he is likely to be pushing, based on what he has said in the past.</p> <p><strong>1 - Introducing tighter curbs on student visas. </strong>(Timothy wrote about that <a href=\"http://www.conservativehome.com/thecolumnists/2015/12/nick-timothy-the-government-as-a-whole-isnt-aiming-to-cut-immigration-at-all-and-the-autumn-statement-proved-it.html\">here.)</a></p> <p><strong>2 - Making it easier for faith schools to expand.</strong> In<a href=\"http://www.conservativehome.com/thecolumnists/2016/01/nick-timothy-how-schools-can-bring-our-divided-communities-together.html\"> a ConservativeHome article</a> Timothy wrote:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The government should abolish its admissions rule for faith-designated free schools \u2013 which requires a school, when it is oversubscribed, to limit the number of pupils it accepts on the basis of faith to fifty per cent \u2013 and replace it with a more effective approach. The existing rule fails according to its own objective: it does little to increase the diversity of Jewish, Muslim, Sikh and Hindu schools, because for now at least they are unlikely to appeal to parents of other faiths. But the rule is effectively discriminatory for Roman Catholics: it prevents them from opening new free schools because it is almost certainly <a href=\"http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/_P2N.HTM\">against canon law</a> for a Catholic Bishop to set up a school that turned away Catholic pupils on the basis of their Catholicism. Given that there is growing demand for Roman Catholic schools, which are more likely to be ethnically diverse than other schools, more likely to be in poor areas, more likely to be rated Good or Outstanding by Ofsted, and more likely to provide what parents want, the rule should be replaced by a legal duty on faith schools to ensure that their pupils mix \u2013 perhaps through sport, performing arts, or school visits \u2013 with children of other backgrounds.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>3 - Making welfare more contributions-based.</strong> In another article Timothy said one problem with the Conservative election defeat of 1906 was that it led to plans for contributions-based welfare backed by his hero Joe Chamberlain being shelved.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In 1906, MPs behaved as though their identities as free traders and tariff reformers were more important than as Unionists, and the consequences of their defeat continue to be felt even now. The Lloyd George \u2018People\u2019s Budget\u2019 of 1908 introduced a non-contributory pension system \u2013 unlike the contributions-based proposal made by Chamberlain that was rejected by Salisbury and Balfour \u2013 and our welfare state to this day remains non-contributory (a fact that is, coincidentally, relevant to the debate about EU nationals claiming benefits in Britain).</p> </blockquote> <p>As my colleague Heather Stewart has already reported, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/29/theresa-may-urged-revive-social-insurance\">May\u2019s new director of policy, John Godfrey, is also interested in social insurance systems that create stronger links between what individuals pay and the welfare they get. </a></p> <p><strong>4 - More housebuilding.</strong> <a href=\"http://www.conservativehome.com/thecolumnists/2016/03/nick-timothy-what-does-the-conservative-party-offer-a-working-class-kid-from-brixton-birmingham-bolton-or-bradford.html\">In another ConservativeHome article</a> Timothy wrote:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Often \u2013 on aspects of welfare reform, the increase in the minimum wage, and the investment in the Northern Powerhouse and the (excruciatingly badly-branded) Midlands Engine \u2013 the Government has got these calls right. But when it comes to energy policy, house building, <a href=\"http://www.conservativehome.com/thecolumnists/2015/12/nick-timothy-the-government-as-a-whole-isnt-aiming-to-cut-immigration-at-all-and-the-autumn-statement-proved-it.html\">high immigration</a>, <a href=\"http://www.conservativehome.com/thecolumnists/2015/11/nick-timothy-dividing-lines-and-binary-choices-how-the-tax-credit-changes-went-wrong.html\">cuts to tax credits</a>, the protection of pensioner benefits, and the profile of spending cuts, it has not.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>5 - A full inquiry into Orgreave. </strong>The Home Office is still considering calls for a full inquiry into Orgreave, but Timothy said <a href=\"http://www.conservativehome.com/thecolumnists/2016/05/nick-timothy-as-with-hillsborough-we-must-get-to-the-bottom-of-what-happened-at-orgreave.html\">in a ConservativeHome article </a>he was in favour of a proper inquiry.<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The economy needed to be reformed, the unions needed to be faced down, and unprofitable pits needed to be closed. But if the police pre-planned a mass, unlawful assault on the miners at Orgreave, and then sought to cover up what they did and arrest people on trumped-up charges, we need to know.</p> </blockquote> <p>And here are two ideas that Timothy strongly supports - but which May is much less likely to back because they would involve abandoning Conservative party manifesto promises.</p> <p><strong>6 - Getting rid of the \u201ctriple lock\u201d that ensure state pensions rise every year in line with growth or inflation or by 2.5%, whichever is higher.</strong></p> <p><strong>7 - Abandoning plans to lift the inheritance tax threshold to \u00a31m.</strong> In<a href=\"http://www.conservativehome.com/thecolumnists/2015/11/nick-timothy-dividing-lines-and-binary-choices-how-the-tax-credit-changes-went-wrong.html\"> one ConservativeHome article</a> Timothy wrote:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>[The chancellor] could redistribute the welfare cuts to take the pressure off low-paid, working people. But the obvious alternative is already off the table: pensioner benefits are protected and so is the \u201ctriple lock\u201d, which means that the state pension goes up by the highest out of the growth of wages, inflation or 2.5 per cent. Another option \u2013 to demonstrate that the Government really does value hard work above all else \u2013 is to stop the inheritance tax cut for estates valued between \u00a3650,000 and \u00a31 million. But that policy is not only a manifesto promise but a totem for the Conservative party.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-09-08T14:50:37.251Z\">at 3.50pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57d1697de4b07ac3d446a39c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-08T13:40:29.517Z\">2.40pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Sam Freedman</strong>, who used to be a policy adviser to Michael Gove when Gove was education secretary and he is now executive director at <strong>Teach First</strong>, the organisation that gets high-powered graduates into teaching, has put out a statement strongly criticising the plans to extend grammar schools.

Cameron was opposed to opening brand new grammar schools. Letwin said that he personally was \u201cperfectly content\u201d to see the government explore the idea of expanding them, but he also said he was \u201ccompletely agnostic\u201d about whether one type of school was necessarily better than another.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57d1430be4b08465d44fe9b3\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-08T12:08:11.900Z\">1.08pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">5 thing we've learnt from Justine Greening's UQ on grammar schools</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Ministers are often hauled to the Commons to answer an urgent question (UQ) when the government has floated a policy idea in the media but has not yet made a formal announcement. That is exactly what happened today, when <strong>Angela Rayner</strong>, the shadow education secretary, was granted a UQ on the back of the Telegraph splash. Normally the minister just turns up and tells MPs to wait until the formal policy paper is published, and in many respects that\u2019s what <strong>Justine Greening,</strong> the education secretary, was doing today, but these sessions can be nevertheless be quite illuminating and today\u2019s certainly was. Here are five things we learnt.</p> <p><strong>1 - Theresa May\u2019s plan to \u201cbring back grammar schools\u201d is popular with Conservative MPs - but only up to a point.</strong> Most of the Tory MPs who spoke expressed support for grammar schools. But the very first backbencher to be called, and arguably the most important on this issue, <strong>Neil Carmichael</strong>, the Conservative who chairs the Commons education committee, expressed strong reservations. Telling Greening that the UK was well down the table in international literacy and numeracy league tables, he went on:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It is absolutely necessary for any discussion about grammar schools to not distract us from that fundamental task that we have of improving social mobility and making sure that we have the best use of all of the talent across the whole country and not just talk about the few.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Sir Desmond Swayne,</strong> a former PPS to David Cameron and certainly no Tory leftie, told Greening that he would not fancy having to face parents in his constituency who could not get their children into a local grammar school. (See <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/sep/08/grammar-schools-theresa-may-plans-for-inclusive-grammar-schools-slammed-politics-live?page=with:block-57d139b8e4b0c1d95ae148eb#block-57d139b8e4b0c1d95ae148eb\">11.14am.)</a> And<strong> Lucy Allan, </strong>another Conservative, demanded an assurance that there would be no return to the days of the 11-plus. (See<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/sep/08/grammar-schools-theresa-may-plans-for-inclusive-grammar-schools-slammed-politics-live?page=with:block-57d137e5e4b042bbfb32482d#block-57d137e5e4b042bbfb32482d\"> 11.07am.)</a></p> <p><strong>2 - Greening herself seems to sceptical about championing a grammar school renaissance.</strong> Some Labour MPs said they thought Greening sounded distinctly lukewarm about the policy she was supposed to be defending and they were right. Greening kept stressing the importance of having an open mind on the matter of educational reform and she said nothing to suggest that she is a grammar school enthusiast (while, quite cleverly, also avoiding sounding disloyal to May.) In fact, Greening even seemed reluctant to use the term \u201cgrammar school\u201d, instead preferring to talk about selection.</p> <p><strong>3 - A full return to a grammar school system seems to be off the table - although the government is considering letting more grammar schools open and extending the principle of selection in state education. </strong>Greening was not specific about much, but she did make it very clear that the government was not planning a full return to the grammar/secondary modern era. She said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There will be no return to the simplistic, binary choice of the past where schools separate children into winners and losers, successes or failures. This government wants to focus on the future, to build on our success since 2010 and to create a truly 21st century schools system.</p> </blockquote> <p>And when asked if she would return to the days of the 11-plus, she replied:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I can assure you that there will be no return to the past. This is about moving forward. This is about having a 21st century approach to our school system, precisely not one that is rooted in the 1960s and 1970s. </p> </blockquote> <p>But Greening did say: \u201cWe do think selection can play a role.\u201d It could be that May is keen to talk about grammar schools is because the phrase is popular with the public. (See <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/sep/08/grammar-schools-theresa-may-plans-for-inclusive-grammar-schools-slammed-politics-live?page=with:block-57d127bee4b0b2ee83376361#block-57d127bee4b0b2ee83376361\">10.08am.) </a>But whether the government\u2019s proposals really do involve a large number of new grammar schools, in the traditional meaning of the word, remains to be seen.</p> <p><strong>4 - </strong><strong>Labour is remarkably united in strongly opposing grammar schools. </strong>By my count only one Labour MP expressed some support for the government\u2019s idea (<strong>Kate Hoey</strong>) and otherwise it was striking how MPs from all wings of the party spoke out very strongly against the idea. <strong>Angela Rayner,</strong> the shadow education secretary, was particularly effective. She told Greening:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Can you tell the House what evidence you have to support your belief that grammar schools will help disadvantaged children and close the attainment gap? At a time when our schools are facing a crisis in teacher recruitment and retention, with the thousands taught in super-sized classes and schools facing real-term cuts to their budget for the first time in nearly two decades, pushing ahead with grammar schools shows a dangerous misunderstanding of the real issues facing our schools.</p> </blockquote> <p>This makes it all the more surprising that Jeremy Corbyn chose not to raise the grammar school issue at PMQs yesterday. Perhaps he chose to avoid the subject because <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3778820/Corbyn-s-team-attended-used-grammars-children.html\">his son attended one, and his head of strategy and communications Seumas Milne sent his children to grammar schools.</a> Given that<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/1999/may/13/uk.politicalnews2\"> Corbyn\u2019s second marriage broke up because he did not want his son to go to a grammar school</a>, he could argue that his opposition to grammar schools is so strong and sincere that it has led to great sacrifice. But it is understandable why someone very reluctant to discuss his family in public may have decided it was a subject best avoided at PMQs.</p> <p><strong>5 - T</strong><strong>he Tories will try to turn this into an issue of what works versus ideology. </strong>Greening did not really engage with the arguments raised about grammar schools and social mobility. Instead, she just argued that it was sensible to have a debate, and she accused Labour of being dogmatic. </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It would be wrong to discount how we can improve prospects for those children, especially the most disadvantaged, purely because of political dogma. If Labour is not willing to ask itself these difficult questions, how can it possibly come up with any of the solutions? </p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3c032f06bf39507cbcec5abcadc19072e37293f8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3c032f06bf39507cbcec5abcadc19072e37293f8/49_0_720_432/500.jpg\" alt=\"Justine Greening.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Justine Greening answering the UQ on grammar schools.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC/BBC News</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-09-08T12:21:32.756Z\">at 1.21pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57d14114e4b013613fffb3e3\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-08T10:49:10.638Z\">11.49am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here is my colleague <strong>Heather Stewart</strong> on Justine Greening\u2019s UQ.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/GuardianHeather/status/773821240209465344\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Justine Greening sounding less-than-enthusiastic about grammars in House.

However, it is certainly interesting to note that public opinion is quite nuanced; when people were confronted with two counterarguments to grammar schools, support was in some cases strong. What does this mean for the overall stance of public opinion? It could mean two things: first, it could suggest that public opinion is malleable and that if parties opposed to new grammar schools exploit that malleability, the voters may be turned away from grammar schools. Alternatively, though, it could suggest that while voters are clearly aware of the counterarguments to grammar schools \u2013 and have some degree of affinity with them \u2013 this is already baked in to the polling numbers; in other words, that voters know the problems with grammar schools but feel overall that grammar schools should still be opened.</p> </blockquote> <p>Polling Digest also says that people \u201coverwhelmingly agree that grammar schools help academic success and increase social mobility\u201d. This is interesting because it is the exact opposite of what people who are experts in social mobility have been saying, like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/sep/07/former-tory-minister-grammar-schools-fail-disadvantaged-children\">David Willetts here,</a> or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/sep/07/grammar-schools-expansion-disaster-social-mobility-tsar-alan-milburn\">Alan Miliburn here.</a> (Put more bluntly, the public are wrong.)</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57d12605e4b0c1d95ae14883\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-08T08:50:26.205Z\">9.50am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>My colleague <strong>Sally Weale </strong>has written a very good article about what it is like for parents in Kent where children are sitting the 11-plus to see if they can get into grammar school.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/sep/08/kent-children-11-plus-government-plans-grammar-schools\">Kent children sit 11-plus as government plans new grammar schools</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57d122efe4b0b2ee83376350\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-08T08:36:44.795Z\">9.36am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>There is an urgent question on grammar schools in the Commons at 10.30am.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/labourwhips/status/773794329462706176\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">UQ at 10.30 from <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AngelaRayner\">@AngelaRayner</a> asking <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JustineGreening\">@JustineGreening</a> on Government plans to lift the statutory ban on opening new Grammar Schools in Eng</p>&mdash; Labour Whips (@labourwhips) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/labourwhips/status/773794329462706176\">September 8, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>The speaker takes a dim view of ministers announcing policy on the front page of the Telegraph and not in the House of Commons chamber.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57d1213ce4b0b2ee83376349\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-08T08:32:21.976Z\">9.32am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Tusk says UK should start Brexit talks with EU &quot;asap&quot;</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Donald Tusk,</strong> the president of the European council, is meeting Theresa May in Number 10 this morning.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/eucopresident/status/773798859067813888\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Meeting PM <a href=\"https://twitter.com/theresa_may\">@theresa_may</a> to inform about EU27 <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bratislavasummit?src=hash\">#Bratislavasummit</a> and discuss process for Brexit talks <a href=\"https://t.co/ANGuFY7wAC\">pic.twitter.com/ANGuFY7wAC</a></p>&mdash; Donald Tusk (@eucopresident) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/eucopresident/status/773798859067813888\">September 8, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/eucopresident/status/773798947697659904\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Our goal to establish closest possible EU-UK relations.

She suggested that some of the government\u2019s 500 new free schools, announced by David Cameron shortly before he stepped down, could be grammars. \u201cShe said she didn\u2019t want a situation where parents wanted a selective school only to be told they couldn\u2019t have one,\u201d a source at the meeting said. </p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Michael Fallon</strong>, the defence secretary, has been defending the government\u2019s plans this morning. But<strong> Nick Clegg</strong>, the former deputy prime minister and former Lib Dem leader, and<strong> Ed Balls,</strong> the former shadow chancellor, have both used interviews this morning to criticise the plans. Clegg said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I know they talked about grammar schools in their manifesto. They didn\u2019t talk about extending selection to free schools and so on, which seems to be now what they intend to do. This is the danger of having a new government with new leadership and new priorities, not elected by the people, now foisting their own evidence-free prejudices upon us. There\u2019s no evidence at all that that is the answer to many of the problems in our education system.</p> </blockquote> <p>And Balls said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>To tell a kid at 10 or 11, you\u2019re second best, they then have to arrive at that school and the teachers have a huge task to persuade them, you can still do well, you\u2019ve still got talent, you\u2019ve still got ability.

Well, they\u2019re back, at least. It\u2019s typically a rather spicy affair, dogs and cats fighting, scrapping over some long-past disagreement they probably can\u2019t even remember themselves. But perhaps this is the chance these auld rivals have been waiting for to just make friends. Why fight, after all? It\u2019s a mixed-up, muddled-up, shook-up world out there, so what better for wonderful global harmony than if they joined hands and stopped being so beastly to each other?</p> <p>After all, they\u2019re not so different, really. Both have gaffe-prone former Arsenal defenders [check this \u2013 Fiver Tautology Ed] in Kolo Tour\u00e9 and Philippe Senderos. Both have midfield snappers that you\u2019d hesitate before taking home to meet your mother in Scott Brown and Joey Barton. And ultimately both, secretly, although they\u2019re too bashful to actually say it, if they\u2019re honest, have really, really, really missed each other. When you look at it that way, the only way this can end is for everyone to finish the game with a big, warm, mass embrace.

  "<p>The former Belgian prime minister Guy Verhofstadt has been appointed lead Brexit negotiator for the European parliament, as the other 27 EU member states gear up for the complex negotiations ahead.</p> <p>Any deal on Britain\u2019s new relationship with the rest of the EU after Brexit will have to be ratified by the European parliament, and Verhofstadt, regarded as a diehard European, will represent the views of MEPs from across the EU.

What would stop other countries from asking the same exceptional status?\u201d he said.</p> <p>Instead, Verhofstadt said, some form of associate status for Britain would be a better approach \u201cwith less obligations but equally less rights\u201d.</p> <p>Vincenzo Scarpetta, of the thinktank Open Europe, <a href=\"http://openeurope.org.uk/today/blog/guy-verhofstadt-european-parliaments-top-brexit-negotiator-mean/\">in a blogpost about the appointment</a>, suggested that Verhofstadt\u2019s role would be less critical than that of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/27/jean-claude-juncker-puts-michel-barnier-in-charge-brexit-talks\">Michel Barnier, the French former EU commissioner who will negotiate on behalf of the more powerful commission</a>.</p> <p>Scarpetta added: \u201cOn a personal level Verhofstadt could be a pretty tough nut to crack. A diehard European federalist, he generally comes across as less pragmatic than Barnier. I would expect Verhofstadt to be particularly intransigent when it comes to splitting the EU\u2019s so-called four freedoms \u2013 that is the free movement of goods, services, capital and people.\u201d</p> <p>Verhofstadt\u2019s appointment was applauded by the Scottish National party. He has backed the SNP\u2019s case for an independent Scotland to be quickly admitted to the EU. In a tweet after it became clear on 24 June that Scotland had voted strongly to remain in the EU, he said: \u201cIt\u2019s wrong that Scotland might be taken out of EU, when it voted to stay. Happy to discuss with Nicola Sturgeon.\u201d</p> <p>Before meeting Scotland\u2019s first minister, late June, he added: \u201cIf Scotland decides to leave the UK, to be an independent state, and they decide to be part of the European union I think there is no big obstacle to do that.\u201d<br></p> <p>It is unclear if a Scottish claim for entry as an independent state will affect the UK\u2019s Brexit negotiations, or the European parliament\u2019s response, but Alyn Smith, the SNP MEP, said he was delighted with the former Belgium premier\u2019s appointment. \u201cGuy\u2019s appointment is good news \u2013 we can do business. He is a long-standing respected MEP. [He] has also proven he is alive to the Scottish question and I have every confidence all the doors we need are open.\u201d </p> <p>Verhofstadt\u2019s appointment was announced after the president of the European council, Donald Tusk, used a breakfast meeting in Downing Street to urge the prime minister to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/08/donald-tusk-theresa-may-article-50-brexit-negotiations-eu\">press ahead with formal negotiations as soon as possible</a>.</p> <p>Speaking before the pair shared what a spokeswoman said was a friendly breakfast of scrambled eggs and smoked salmon, Tusk said: \u201cThe ball is now in your court.\u201d</p> <p>The spokeswoman said the pair had discussed working together to create a \u201csmooth process for Britain\u2019s exit from the EU but reiterated that May would not invoke article 50, which begins the formal negotiations, before the end of the year.</p> <p>May also discussed with Tusk, a former prime minister of Poland, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/30/five-teenage-boys-arrested-after-man-dies-following-attack-in-essex\">recent attacks on Polish people</a> in the UK, the spokeswoman said. She sought to reassure him that Britain was a \u201ctolerant country\u201d and would remain so outside the EU. She detailed the action the government was taking to crack down on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/hate-crime\">hate crime</a>.</p> <p>With uncertainty over the EU\u2019s future likely to dampen economic confidence, the government could face increasing pressure from the other member states. Other EU leaders will meet in Bratislava next week \u2013 without Britain \u2013 to consider the way forward.</p> <p>But Tusk made clear there could be little progress until article 50 was triggered. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean that we are going to discuss our future relations with the UK in Bratislava, because for this, and especially for the start of the negotiations, we need the formal notification, I mean triggering article 50. This is the position shared by all 27 member states. To put it simply, the ball is now in your court. I\u2019m aware that it is not easy but I still hope you will be ready to start the process as soon as possible. I have no doubt that at the end of the day our common strategic goal is to establish the closest possible relations.\u201d</p> <p>With Westminster\u2019s summer recess now over, the government is gearing up for the challenge of Britain\u2019s EU exit. However, May gave little away about her intentions, insisting in the Commons on Wednesday that her government would not give a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/sep/07/theresa-may-not-provide-running-commentary-on-brexit-negotiations-video\">\u201crunning commentary\u201d</a> on the issue.</p> <p>May has made clear that controls on immigration would have to be a key element of any deal, but she does not favour the points-based system that was advocated by many pro-Brexit campaigners in the run-up to the referendum.<br></p> <p>It is also unclear whether May believes Britain can remain a member of the single market after leaving. The Brexit secretary, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/05/david-davis-vows-to-build-national-consensus-on-brexit\">David Davis</a>, who was asked if Britain could remain inside the single market, said this week: \u201cThe simple truth is that if a requirement of membership is giving up control of our borders, I think that makes it very improbable.\u201d</p> <p>But the prime minister\u2019s spokeswoman subsequently indicated that Davis was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/06/david-davis-single-market-stance-not-government-policy\">\u201csetting out his opinion\u201d</a> rather than making a statement of government policy \u2013 underlining the tensions that could emerge between the pro-remain prime minister and the pro-Brexit team she has put in charge of negotiating Britain\u2019s departure.</p> <p>May has also insisted that she <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/27/theresa-may-acting-like-tudor-monarch-in-denying-mps-a-vote-over-brexit\">does not see the need</a> for a parliamentary vote to ratify a decision to trigger article 50.</p>",

  "<p>The Seattle Reign midfielder Megan Rapinoe and Washington Spirit owner Bill Lynch aren\u2019t so different. That statement may seem strange in the wake of Wednesday\u2019s incidents at the Maryland SoccerPlex, where Lynch metaphorically kicked the platform out from under Rapinoe\u2019s feet, only to suffer <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/soccer-insider/wp/2016/09/08/megan-rapinoe-responds-to-washington-spirit-playing-national-anthem-with-teams-in-locker-room/\">Rapinoe\u2019s blistering response</a> a couple of hours later. </p> <p>But Rapinoe and Lynch have a couple of things in common. They\u2019re devoted to women\u2019s soccer, even with all its difficulties and controversies. And they both wear their hearts on their sleeves. Rapinoe drew attention earlier last weekend by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/04/megan-rapinoe-anthem-protest-colin-kaepernick\">taking a knee during the national anthem</a> at a Reign home game, an act of solidarity with San Francisco quarterback Colin Kaepernick\u2019s well-publicized decision to sit during the anthem as a protest over race issues in the United States. Would she do the same at the Maryland SoccerPlex, in the exurbs of the nation\u2019s capital?<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/07/megan-rapinoe-anthem-protest-washtington-spirit-colin-kaepernick\">Washington Spirit move anthem to avoid Megan Rapinoe 'hijacking'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Lynch didn\u2019t give her the chance. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/07/megan-rapinoe-anthem-protest-washtington-spirit-colin-kaepernick\">He rearranged the pregame schedule</a> so that the anthem would be played while the players were in the locker rooms. At the same time, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JeffKassouf/status/773669540471443456\">the Spirit emailed a press release</a> to journalists explaining the decision.<br></p> <p>The words were clumsy, attempting to compliment Rapinoe but undermining the point with loaded words like \u201chijack.\u201d That\u2019s not surprising to those who have long followed the Spirit. Lynch is far from shy about speaking up to praise the military, and at each home game, the PA announcer reads an awkward statement thanking those who are currently serving or have served. It\u2019s sincere, but the sheer repetition of it has turned it into background noise.<br></p> <p>And Lynch\u2019s statement was a clear misreading of the women\u2019s soccer fanbase. Washington Spirit fans are generally not the flag-burning type, and you can\u2019t hold a gathering of 3,000 people in the DC area without including quite a few veterans or current military. But they\u2019re also not receptive to any perceived limits on free expression. When Rapinoe, who is still regaining fitness after a knee injury, entered the game in the second half, the Spirit\u2019s supporters group <a href=\"https://twitter.com/blackandredU/status/773691866151653376\">greeted her warmly</a>.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/video/2016/sep/02/why-colin-kaepernick-not-standing-national-anthem-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/5xnvh\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2693672\"            data-video-name=\"Why is Colin Kaepernick not standing for the national anthem? \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57c9a8eee4b0456abb93d6d7\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/09/05/160902kapwithobama_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/09/05/160902kapwithobama.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/09/05/160902kapwithobama_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/video/2016/sep/02/why-colin-kaepernick-not-standing-national-anthem-video\">Why is Colin Kaepernick not standing for the national anthem?</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>So Lynch\u2019s move had backfired. Had Rapinoe knelt during the anthem as expected, fans surely would\u2019ve moved on. Instead, we got the extraordinary sight of die-hard fans \u2013 who have a history of needling otherwise-beloved US players on behalf of the hometown Spirit \u2013 cheering for an opponent in the midst of a game with massive playoff implications.</p> <p>Even Jeff Plush, the league\u2019s low-profile commissioner who happened to be in attendance, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/caitlinbuckley2/status/773685568622518273\">was taken aback</a>. Rapinoe had surely claimed the high ground without saying a word. And Rapinoe gave it right back, going beyond mere profane criticism of Lynch\u2019s anthem antics and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/caitlinbuckley2/status/773729577281650688\">calling the Spirit owner \u201chomophobic.\u201d</a></p> <p>The claim is, to put it mildly, not substantiated by history. Before the NWSL existed, Lynch started a club called DC United Women and found a way to bring in Joanna Lohman and Lianne Sanderson, at the time the most vocal gay soccer players in the world (and, at the time, a couple).</p> <p>DC United Women morphed into the Spirit, and the team\u2019s first captain was Lori Lindsey, who had openly discussed her sexuality a few months earlier. The team has continued to employ gay players, including Lohman, who has had a career renaissance since returning to Washington last year. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/05/barack-obama-colin-kaepernick-national-anthem-protest\">Obama defends US football player refusing to stand for national anthem</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And earlier this season, the Spirit responded to the shooting at a gay nightclub in Orlando with <a href=\"http://www.excellesports.com/news/pride-spirit-fans-players-stand-together-orlando-washington/\">emotional observances when the Orlando Pride visited</a>, painting a rainbow ribbon (technically a violation of the Laws of the Game, but no referee would be a stickler on this occasion) on the field.</p> <p>Simply put, if Lynch has an issue with homosexuality, it boggles the mind that he would\u2019ve bought into women\u2019s soccer in the first place. Today\u2019s women\u2019s soccer community is far removed from its &#xa0;heteronormative marketing of the 1990s and early 2000s. Rapinoe and Abby Wambach, who are both gay, are two of the first names who would spring to mind if a casual fan were asked to name recent US women\u2019s players.</p> <p>Whether Rapinoe faces any backlash from her words will speak volumes about the state of the volatile US women\u2019s soccer community, still reeling from the early ouster in the Rio Olympics and the dismissal of ever-controversial goalkeeper Hope Solo. </p> <p>Even as players and their lawyers plow through contentious contract negotiations, riding the slogan \u201cEqual Pay for Equal Play,\u201d players make curious demands for special treatment. The USA and Houston Dash star Carli Lloyd recently refused to take part in a postgame media session until a reporter who <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RipSports/status/770302496577236992\">had previously asked </a>about her absence from the team <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NWSLmedia/status/772517169947029505\">was removed</a>, a decision that would generate fodder for talk radio for days in a more prominent sports league. Other players are far less accessible to the media than they had been in past years.</p> <p>Despite it all, the NWSL has gained some traction this year. <a href=\"http://equalizersoccer.com/2016/08/31/the-lowdown-another-messy-re-entry-for-nwsl\">Attendance is up</a> in most markets, and Orlando has embraced its expansion team. The league finally returned to television Wednesday night with an entertaining clash between Chicago and Kansas City coming across well despite technical glitches such a faulty microphone for play-by-play commentator Jenn Hildreth.<br></p> <p>And the play has been terrific. The Spirit had more to celebrate last night than clinching a home playoff date \u2013 reigning league MVP Crystal Dunn <a href=\"https://twitter.com/OurGameMagazine/status/773685657378050048\">emphatically snapped out of a goal-scoring drought</a>.</p> <p>Can the league can take the \u201cno such thing as bad publicity\u201d adage to heart and turn attention to the action on the field? And will players who are still adjusting the having a platform be able to adjust to dealing with the response?<br></p> <p>Both questions have no easy answers. But with passionate people like Rapinoe and Lynch making statements \u2013 sometimes misstatements \u2013 the questions won\u2019t be going away any time soon.<br></p> <ul> <li><em>Disclaimer: The reporter has written an unofficial book about the Washington Spirit\u2019s first season in 2013, and he occasionally writes about youth soccer for SoccerWire, a site owned by Spirit president Chris Hummer.&#xa0;</em></li> </ul> <p><br></p>",
  "<p>It was supposed to be the substantive counterpoint to a primary season dominated by frivolity, but Wednesday\u2019s national security forum \u2013 hosted by NBC and featuring back-to-back appearances by Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump \u2013 was nothing of the sort.</p> <p>To say it wasn\u2019t television news\u2019 finest hour <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/08/for-clinton-a-skirmish-with-history-from-trump-an-ambush-of-the-facts\">would be an understatement</a>.</p> <p>Instead of testing the limits of Trump\u2019s knowledge or probing Clinton to move beyond her standard talking points, the forum\u2019s setup seemed to encourage candidates to assume their usual roles.

He did the same routine a second time when asked about his relationship to Vladimir Putin, saying first that Putin\u2019s favorable impression of him would not have any impact on him and then saying the exact opposite thing in the next sentence: \u201cIf he says great things about me, I\u2019m going to say great things about him.\u201d No matter, both Trump and Lauer had moved on.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video element--supporting\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/sep/08/donald-trump-putin-more-of-a-leader-of-his-country-than-obama-for-us-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/525fa\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2700631\"            data-video-name=\"Donald Trump: Putin is far more of a leader of his country than Obama is for US \u2013\u00a0video\"            data-video-provider=\"NBC News\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57d10cdae4b0c1d95ae14821\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/09/08/160907Trump4putin_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/09/08/160907Trump4putin.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/09/08/160907Trump4putin_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/sep/08/donald-trump-putin-more-of-a-leader-of-his-country-than-obama-for-us-video\">Trump: Putin is more of a leader of his country than Obama is for US \u2013 video</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>The approach allows listeners to hear whatever they want to hear, something Trump, in his myth-making book, The Art of the Deal, touted as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/01/trump-immigration-code-switching-not-skillful-disingenuous\">one of his greatest strengths</a>. It also gives Trump an opportunity to parrot compliments he\u2019s received \u2013 in this case, from Putin.</p> <p>Lauer\u2019s not a national security expert and doesn\u2019t have a reputation for being hard-hitting. But even with that disposition and background, he still should have managed to call Trump out some of these things.</p> <p>Yet to simply blame Lauer for what\u2019s widely considered to be a missed opportunity is to miss the forest for the trees. Sure, he failed to elicit a substantive policy discussion from Trump. But he also failed where every other major moderator has failed as well. If there\u2019s a formula for stopping Trump from coasting on insults and babble, nobody\u2019s found it yet, and playing PolitiFact in real time is no easy feat.</p> <p>There were a few places where Trump walked himself into a corner, like his comment about how, under President Obama, military generals have been \u201creduced to rubble\u201d and things have eroded to a point where \u201cit\u2019s embarrassing\u201d. Those remarks came off as deeply unpatriotic. But any resulting controversy, like the comment he made last year about John McCain not being a war hero, will fade.</p> <p>Trump is winning the military vote handily, after all, as every Republican candidate in recent elections has. It\u2019s a vote that\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/military-communities-favor-trump-over-clinton-n644176\">disproportionately white, male and lacking a college degree</a> \u2013 which is to say, it checks all the right boxes for him. And no outlier comment about generals in a policy forum is going to change that.<br></p> <p>What does matter and should scare Clinton is that she just got an ugly preview of the coming debates: despite establishment insistence that Trump\u2019s playground-style taunts won\u2019t work on her in the general, we saw during Wednesday night\u2019s forum that they can.</p> <p>Trump is already using such tactics against Clinton, as he did at a town hall in Virginia earlier this week when he made a gendered dig about how <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/trump-putin-clinton-laughs-2016-9\">\u201cPutin looks at her and he laughs\u201d</a>. He did it when he observed her to be lacking a <a href=\"http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2016/09/donald-trump-says-clinton-doesnt-look-presidential.html\">\u201cpresidential look\u201d</a>, and when he insinuates she\u2019s untrustworthy through silly monikers like Crooked Hillary. It\u2019s an approach Paul Krugman referred to earlier this week as the politics of <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/05/opinion/hillary-clinton-gets-gored.html?rref=collection%2Fcolumn%2Fpaul-krugman&amp;action=click&amp;contentCollection=opinion&amp;region=stream&amp;module=stream_unit&amp;version=latest&amp;contentPlacement=1&amp;pgtype=collection\">innuendo</a>. It\u2019s not just Trump who\u2019s employing it, but he\u2019s channeling it more effectively than anyone else in recent memory.</p> <p>It was evident during the forum on Wednesday night, and it was evident afterwards, when Clinton\u2019s camp came after Trump on all the inconsistencies he spouted to Lauer, attacking his defense of sexual assault in the military, his embrace of Putin and his tarring of military generals. </p> <p>Meanwhile, the chairman of the Republican party attacked Clinton for, of all things, having <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Reince/status/773694140404170752\">\u201cno smile\u201d</a>. She was left playing defense against innuendo at an event <a href=\"https://twitter.com/chucktodd/status/773673483884720129?lang=en\">expressly billed</a> as the antidote to vapid dialogue. If that\u2019s any indication of what we\u2019re in for this fall, Clinton and anyone in support of examining actual political policy needs to come up with a new strategy.</p>",
  "<p>Isabel Wilkerson\u2019s 2010 bestseller offered a long overdue account of an event in the United States that had a major impact on the cultural fabric of the country: the migration of African Americans out of the south during the early and mid 20th century. When we speak about the history of US migration, this diaspora is rarely mentioned. Cities like New York, Detroit, Chicago and Oakland were end points for many black Americans fleeing Jim Crow and segregation \u2013 often by the same railroad that took settlers out west. Would Detroit have produced the historic music of Motown without the hope of a better life that propelled some black southerners on their way to the mid-west? While many made this journey, this well-researched tome focuses on three people who left the south filled with hope during different periods: Ida Mae Gladney, George Starling and Dr Robert Foster. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"de315cd169cc087b964f568a823056122e3f1a87\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/de315cd169cc087b964f568a823056122e3f1a87/0_0_1836_2775/662.jpg\" alt=\"The Warmth of Other Suns by Isabel Wilkerson\" width=\"662\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Starling was intelligent, a man who dreamed of life beyond the citrus groves and was always destined for college. While he eventually owned a brownstone in New York City, it could not save his unhappy marriage. As fate would have it, he got a job on the railroad \u2013 a job that frequently brought him back to the south, the very place he had so longed to escape. He eventually made enough peace with the south to go back to live there as an old man.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0638066414ca5bc049cfa6c083f5f2199c3734f8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0638066414ca5bc049cfa6c083f5f2199c3734f8/0_87_4256_2554/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Isabel Wilkerson at her home in Atlanta, Georgia.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Truth teller \u2026 Isabel Wilkerson at her home in Atlanta, Georgia.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Gladney and her family snuck out of Mississippi by a night train. To her mother\u2019s chagrin, she followed the path trodden by her siblings, who had already ventured to Ohio, Syracuse and Milwaukee.

She lived well into old age, and her children kept her room just as it was for many years after her death. </p> <p>Foster\u2019s father told him to follow his dreams, as his own had fallen apart. So Foster packed up his 1949 Buick and drove alone out of Monroe, Louisiana, in search of a better life in California. According to Wilkerson: \u201cPerhaps he might have stayed had they let him practise surgery like he was trained to do, or let him walk into the Palace and try on a suit like anyone else of his station.\u201d He sent for his wife and daughters after he had established a private practice in Los Angeles.

Their new lives were not without disappointments: they dealt with grief and loss, seeing their adopted neighbourhoods take a turn for the worse, with new forms of racism. But they also gave hope to younger generations that they might also start afresh \u2013 even if their new lives were only slightly better than the ones they left behind.</p> <p>My family placed their own stakes in this migration in their various journeys from South Carolina to Boston. Growing up in Boston had its challenges, but I had an amazing education that set me on the path I follow today. As an adult, I also migrated in search of my own other sun, via a three-day train ride from Boston to Los Angeles, one week after graduating college. I was the only person in my family to live out there, so I was a bit of a pioneer. Years later, I made my way back east and now proudly call myself a New Yorker. </p> <p>The Warmth of Other Suns shows how hope can get people through the most intense situations, but action is required to make them something more than a dream. These actions will likely involve sacrifices \u2013 but they may not be in vain. Individual hopes can collectively change history.</p>",
  "<p>Airbnb is planning a number of product and policy changes aimed at fighting discrimination on the short-term rental platform, but some critics say the reforms don\u2019t go far enough and will allow for continued racial prejudices.</p> <p>Airbnb \u2013 which has faced widespread backlash over hosts <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/may/05/airbnbwhileblack-hashtag-highlights-potential-racial-bias-rental-app\">refusing to rent to black guests</a> \u2013 released a 30-page report on Thursday outlining new nondiscrimination policies and systems designed to address user complaints.</p> <p>The changes, which include the creation of a \u201cpermanent, full-time team\u201d dedicated to addressing bias and promoting diversity, make Airbnb the latest technology company to announce reforms in the wake of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/aug/30/tech-companies-racial-discrimination-nextdoor-airbnb\">high-profile scandal</a> surrounding racist and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jul/20/twitter-vows-act-more-swiftly-banning-leslie-jones-abuser-milo-yiannopoulos\">abusive behaviors of users</a>.</p> <p>The San Francisco-based company faced intense scrutiny after black users began sharing stories of rejection using the hashtag #AirbnbWhileBlack. Some have said they were able to get bookings after they <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jun/08/airbnb-service-black-people-noirbnb-noirebnb\">changed their photos</a> to white people.</p> <p>Research has backed their claims, with one Harvard University <a href=\"http://www.benedelman.org/publications/airbnb-guest-discrimination-2016-09-04.pdf\">study</a> concluding that guests with \u201cdistinctively African American names\u201d are 16% less likely to be accepted than identical guests with white-sounding names.</p> <p>CEO Brian Chesky <a href=\"http://blog.airbnb.com/an-update-on-the-airbnb-anti-discrimination-review/\">called</a> discrimination \u201cthe greatest challenge we face as a company\u201d, and Airbnb hired former US attorney general Eric Holder and former ACLU official Laura Murphy to work on the problem.</p> <p>The report, written by Murphy, said that through Airbnb\u2019s new \u201cOpen Doors\u201d initiative, \u201cif a guest is not able to book a listing because they have been discriminated against, Airbnb will ensure the guest finds a place to stay\u201d. The program will involve 24/7 personalized responses from \u201cspecially trained\u201d employees. </p> <p>It\u2019s not clear how the firm would guarantee a spot, but Airbnb said if there were no similar listing on the market, the company would \u201cidentify an alternative accommodation option\u201d.</p> <p>The firm said it would also expand an \u201cInstant Book Listings\u201d program that allows guests to immediately reserve a room without host approval.</p> <p>\u201cInstant Book reduces the potential for bias because hosts automatically accept guests who meet these objective custom settings they have put in place,\u201d the report said.</p> <p>The firm also vowed to diversify its workforce. Like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/aug/03/apple-diversity-report-race-gender-facebook-google\">Apple</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jul/14/facebook-diversity-report-silicon-valley-employment\">Facebook</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jul/01/twitter-staff-african-american-diversity\">Twitter</a> and other Silicon Valley firms, Airbnb\u2019s critics have argued that its poor diversity record contributes to its failures to address discrimination.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2016/03/airbnb-diversity-isnt-just-works/\">staff</a> is <a href=\"http://blog.airbnb.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/EEO-1-2015-2.pdf\">reported</a> to be roughly 63% white, 22% Asian, 7% Hispanic and 3% black. The report claims that nearly 10% of its US employees are from \u201cunderrepresented populations\u201d and that it intends to increase that figure to 11% by 2017.</p> <p>The company said it will also now mandate that candidate pools for senior-level positions include women and minorities.</p> <p>Academics have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/aug/30/tech-companies-racial-discrimination-nextdoor-airbnb\">repeatedly argued</a> that an easy fix to weed out discrimination would be eliminating Airbnb profile photos and names from the selection process, so that verified users could book a stay before hosts are aware of their race. In the report, Murphy notes that anonymous tools have helped people avoid prejudice when applying for mortgages and jobs, for example. </p> <p>While the company said it would \u201cexperiment with reducing the prominence of guest photos in the booking process\u201d, the report said \u201cprofile photos are essential to Airbnb\u2019s overall mission of building a community\u201d.</p> <p>Jamila Jefferson-Jones, associate professor of law at the University Missouri, Kansas City, who has <a href=\"http://urbanlawjournal.com/shut-out-of-airbnb-a-proposal-for-remedying-housing-discrimination-in-the-modern-sharing-economy/\">written</a> about Airbnb discrimination, said it would be insufficient to simply deemphasize photos.</p> <p>\u201cIf someone is able to see the picture of the potential guest prior to whether they accept the booking, I think it\u2019s still problematic,\u201d she said, noting that black guests with names like hers will continue to face discrimination. </p> <p>Rashad Robinson, executive director of Color of Change \u2013 which has <a href=\"http://act.colorofchange.org/sign/Airbnb-racism-discrimination-housing/?\">criticized Airbnb</a> and has met with the firm to discuss discrimination \u2013 said the company now appears to be taking the matter much more seriously.<br></p> <p>\u201cWhen we approached Airbnb \u2026 the engagement was not at a high level. In many ways, we felt like they did not see this as a problem or saw this as something they could wish away,\u201d said Robinson, noting that black members of his organization\u2019s board had personal experiences with discrimination on the platform.</p> <p>\u201cThis has been a very different engagement \u2026 and we\u2019re hoping that that this does address the problem,\u201d he said.</p> <p>If the startup can find a way to effectively combat bias while keeping photos in place, Robinson said he would support the changes.</p> <p>\u201cResults are results. The metric of success here is less discrimination and dehumanizing treatment of black folks and other people of color.\u201d</p>",

Then, once they had completely exhausted all appeals, the government should have given them the option of returning to Jamaica themselves, independently, paying for their own flights. This would have allowed them to make applications to return to the UK if they wanted to.</p> <p>By deporting them, their right to apply and return has been taken away.</p> <p>Lawyers representing some of those who were targeted were successful on Tuesday evening in challenging the deportation of their clients, with at least seven people taken off the flight.</p> <p>But many more were unsuccessful. It was inappropriate for the UK to gather up so many and such a mix of people \u2013 each facing different circumstances and with a different status \u2013 in one big sweep, and to charter an aircraft to deport them all at once. Because of the way in which they were removed, the assumption made by some people is that they were all criminals and all in the UK illegally. This has stigmatised everyone on the flight.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>One had arrived to sign in with his baby. While detaining him, the Home Office called social services to take the baby</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Many will have built lives in the UK, have not known Jamaica as an adult and have no family there. Their families in the UK have been ripped apart. On their arrival in Jamaica they will be vulnerable and may face homelessness, poverty and destitution.</p> <p>On Wednesday morning I spoke to the partner of one of the people on the flight. He, like all asylum seekers, was required by the Home Office to sign in frequently at reporting centres or police stations. She told me that two weeks ago, when signing in, he was seized, handcuffed and sustained injuries, and taken to an immigration removal centre. He has a heart condition and diabetes and was subsequently taken to a hospital where his injuries were photographed. He had been signing in every week and electronically tagged for two years.</p> <p>A few months ago he went through an appeal, and then a fresh appeal was refused, as well as a judicial review. His partner said he had access to a phone and was able to call her from the plane; he told her he had been driven right up to the plane, surrounded by police and taken to an undisclosed location. Each of the people on the flight was taken on board one by one.</p> <p>In the background, as he spoke, she could hear crying, screaming and shouting from others on the flight. The pleas and cries will haunt her for ever, she added; the heart has been ripped out of her family. She and her partner have seven children and four grandchildren between them, and her partner was their only grandfather. This is one family\u2019s story, but there will be many others like this.</p> <p>Among those rounded up to be removed are a former soldier who served in the British army, a father of three who arrived in the UK aged four, and one who had arrived to sign in with his baby in a pushchair. While detaining him, the Home Office called social services to take his baby.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/02/dozens-of-asylum-seekers-crammed-into-single-home-office-property\">Dozens of asylum seekers crammed into single Home Office property</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This \u201csnatching\u201d of people with no warning who are attending their routine signing-in appointments could make individuals fearful of attending putting them in a Catch-22 position.

Despite assurances during the EU referendum campaign that there would be a fairer response towards Commonwealth citizens if the country voted in favour of Brexit, this is clearly not the case.</p> <p>It seems like those seen as easy targets are being rounded up for mass forced removals in order to reduce immigration numbers, with no consideration for personal circumstances, health, family, length of time spent in the UK, or whether they were minors when they arrived. There also seems to be no consideration for human rights; article 8 of the European convention on human rights, for instance, which covers family and private life.</p> <p>It is clear that anybody not naturalised is at risk and needs to seek urgent legal advice. Those targeted were given just two weeks between being detained and deported to challenge, seek advice and legal representation. Legal aid cuts are also an issue; these mean that those most likely to face injustice have the least access to justice. Justice should not be a privilege for the wealthy, and given the time constraints faced by those deported, there was very little chance for communities to respond, raise awareness and campaign.</p> <p>It is also of grave concern that airline carriers participate in forced removals and in future any campaign to challenge such inhumane deportations must also consider the role of the aviation sector and airlines. There must also be calls for the Jamaican government to refuse to collude with racist immigration laws and policies that inhumanely target individuals and destroy families and to refuse to accept such chartered removal flights, carrying people against their will, to land on Jamaican soil.</p> <p>In 2010, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/dec/16/g4s-guards-found-not-guilty-manslaughter-jimmy-mubenga\" title=\"\">Jimmy Mubenga</a> died on a deportation flight while being restrained by security guards. The fact that he was on a plane with paying passengers meant there were witnesses to the truth, but on flights like the one today, there are no paying passengers or independent witnesses.</p> <p>Despite the short amount of notice regarding the planned deportation, campaigners responded quickly. A <a href=\"https://www.change.org/p/home-office-stop-the-charter-flight-to-jamaica-7th-september\" title=\"\">petition that was started</a> on Tuesday has attracted over 2,000 signatures. The comments include reports from family members whose loved ones where taken on Wednesday morning or who have family members who have experienced similar targeting in the past.</p> <p>An emergency demonstration was held outside the Jamaican high commission on Tuesday, and BARAC (Black Activists Rising Against Cuts) UK in collaboration with other community activists from across the country on Tuesday evening did an emergency call-out for people to contact Heathrow airport and the duty immigration officer to complain about the forced removal using the hashtag <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23jamaica50&amp;src=typd\" title=\"\">#Jamaica50</a>. BARAC is planning another demonstration in the next couple of weeks. When individuals are deported on scheduled flights, it is also possible to lobby the airline or aircraft carrier.</p> <p>This inhumane targeting and tarnishing is not acceptable. It isn\u2019t just those deported who are affected but also the families left behind \u2013 the children left without parents and the loved ones who are separated. The consequences are lasting, devastating and unfair.</p>",

That process, however, has largely stagnated, guided by the cold, dead-eyed remorselessness of the profit motive during the years <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jul/25/cvc-capital-partners-biggest-winner-history-formula-one\" title=\"\">CVC Capital</a> has owned F1. But it might begin afresh now and there can be cause for optimism that the sport might, for the first time in a long time, be looking firmly into the future.</p> <p>Ecclestone\u2019s control forged its past. When he took over in the late 1970s, the sport was certainly popular but largely among aficionados. Nor was it alone: Group C sports car racing was huge and a real competitor to F1. TV coverage was being sold on a race\u2011by\u2011race basis and the sport\u2019s financing, like many involved in it, was amateur. Ecclestone turned it professional. He saw off the sports cars and established F1 as the single, globally recognised racing series, ensuring that status was no mere ephemera but that it turned into money to bankroll the teams, the owners and the growth of the sport itself.</p> <p>In 2001 he bought the commercial rights to F1 for 100 years from the FIA for $360m, a deal so fortunate and, it must be said, woefully undervalued that everyone wanted a piece of the action. By 2003, the sport\u2019s income was $729m, with CVC buying it in 2006. By last year its income had risen to $1.8bn. These are the numbers that led to the deal dominating recent headlines far beyond the racing. These are the numbers Ecclestone brought to F1. But what is likely to be the most profitable deal in CVC\u2019s history also had a price.</p> <p>CVC stayed out of F1\u2019s management, leaving Ecclestone to do what he does best, making vast sums of money (the company had an $8.2bn return on its investment by 2014) from the two main sources of revenue: the sale of TV rights and the hosting fees charged to circuits. This took F1 to countries more interested in the value to their regimes than in the racing, and to pay-to-view TV. There was also a rather less edifying result \u2013 a drop in the global TV audience from 600 million to 400 million since 2008.</p> <p>F1 was paying out as dutifully as ever but CVC was putting nothing back in. In 2013 Force India\u2019s deputy team principal, Bob Fernley, said the company was \u201craping the sport\u201d and that it was \u201cthe worst thing that has ever happened to Formula One\u201d.</p> <p>Meanwhile the world had accelerated into the digital revolution. Famously Ecclestone has no interest in social media, unable to see how it might turn into a profit, and F1\u2019s presence on the new platforms has been minimal. This, allied to the declining viewing figures, suggested the sport was mortgaging its future for short-term returns. Liberty, it seems, has more in mind.</p> <p>F1\u2019s new chairman, Chase Carey, who was the vice-chairman of 21st Century Fox, is known to be a sports fan and was key in pushing Fox to focus on sports coverage. He is bringing all the right noises to the sport. As expected, expansion, promotion and use of digital content are all being pushed, but Carey is doing so with the backing of a media company, not a private equity firm. If Liberty\u2019s intent is real, F1 could not have found a more suitable partner.</p> <p>The 62-year-old Carey <a href=\"http://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/new-f1-chief-promises-bigger-than-ever-sport-for-fans-and-teams-820386/\" title=\"\">told Motorsport.com</a>: \u201cThe opportunity is to grow and develop this sport for the benefit of the fans, teams, partners and our shareholders by increasing promotion and marketing of Formula One as a sport and brand.\u201d That is a proposal against which there will be no argument from any of the groups he&#xa0;cites.</p> <p>Indeed, Liberty has already said it wants the teams to be part of the investment, a stake that would, regardless of its insignificance, at least be a start. The company will not change the current agreement on how much money the teams receive but its willingness to work with the key players to help the sport grow in pursuit of greater revenue for all is a key step.</p> <p>Equally, fans long dismayed by the sport\u2019s march to soulless enormodromes in the desert might take heart. \u201cI want to be clear that, certainly, the established markets \u2013 the home and foundation of Formula One in Europe in particular \u2013 are of critical importance,\u201d said Carey. \u201cBuilding the sport in Europe, building on that foundation, has got to be second to none. We do want to take advantage of the global footprint of this sport, we want to focus on it.\u201d</p> <p>Again, few will dispute that fortifying the bulwark of the sport makes sense but ambition to expand is also in evidence. \u201cIn the longer term, markets like the US and key Asian markets are opportunities to develop. We\u2019re not going to do that overnight,\u201d he said. \u201cBut there are huge audiences there. If we reach them using digital platforms and some of the tools that haven\u2019t been exploited aggressively, we can build a whole new generation of fans.\u201d</p> <p>Bold plans, then, that are receiving a broadly positive response. But the ink is barely dry and there should be no underestimation of Carey\u2019s credentials as a hard-nosed business man. Liberty did not engage in an $8bn takeover to lose money.</p> <p>How to ensure the bottom line but move on from F1\u2019s current model is the task that lies ahead. Ecclestone, who has played F1\u2019s money game for so long and will continue to broker TV and track deals, was quick to point out what is a very realistic and sobering reality. \u201cCVC&#xa0;bought the company to make money, and that will be the intention of Liberty,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re not looking at it as a hobby.\u201d</p>",

  "<h2>She\u2019s well acquainted with the touch of the velvet hand</h2> <p>Jeepers H Creepers, that was some ending. It felt like a revelation had been coming from the very start, with Terry Colby probing at Philip Price\u2019s motivations, the mystery of Vincent\u2019s beating, the hunt for Tyrell Wellick and Elliot\u2019s encounter with \u201cClaudia Kincaid\u201d. As we moved through the show, the sense of foreboding grew until there they were \u2013 two men riding pillion on a motorbike, submachine guns in hand.

She was sceptical of her boss Agent Santiago\u2019s plan to give a photofit of Cisco to the media. She thought it would alert the Dark Army. Santiago scoffed at this, just as he scoffed at her feeling that the attack on the FBI in China deserved greater investigation. The photofit hit the news and, in an hour, Cisco had been shot by an assassin.</p> <p>Obviously, events suggest an even greater level of conspiracy. How did the assassins know where to go? Dom herself had only worked out the pair\u2019s location seconds before the killers arrived. Were they listening in on the FBI\u2019s own comms? Did they get a tip-off from Santiago? One thing we do know is that they were suicide attackers in the same mode as the Chinese assailants. It seems unlikely that Dom will let the issue drop again.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"03d4ca459a53825a79db410131184274135cc0e3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/03d4ca459a53825a79db410131184274135cc0e3/1_0_922_553/500.jpg\" alt=\"Philip Price, explaining the world\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mr Robot, TV still</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR company handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Lying with his eyes while his hands are busy</h2> <p>We\u2019re now getting a clearer sense of the big story at work. Partly it\u2019s about E Coins. Evil Corp\u2019s own crypto-currency is becoming more prevalent as the banking system continues to struggle. To symbolise this, we see a long queue at an ATM (though surely transactions would take just as long regardless of how much money was available to you?) and Mr Robot notes that the E Coin price of Elliot\u2019s new laptop is much more attractive than the dollar price. My knowledge of macro economics is not quite to Nobel Laureate standard, but I\u2019d imagine that once you control the money supply that\u2019s a pretty significant boost to your power, if being the most powerful man in the world is your thing.</p> <p>That, coincidentally, is Price\u2019s very ambition, as he reveals to Colby in front of a German map tracing the outline of Europe before the first world war. Specifically, Price is motivated by being the most powerful person in the room. And there are only one or two rooms where he does not feel that way. It\u2019s unclear whether the Oval Office is included in this list. Certainly Price feels confident that he can, via Colby, persuade America\u2019s ambassador to the United Nations to vote against his country\u2019s interests and his president\u2019s wishes by abstaining on a vote that would see China annex the Democratic Republic of Congo.</p> <p>Yes, that came out of nowhere.</p> <p>Annexing is usually something you do to a country next to you, or indeed the end of your house. But China\u2019s influence in Africa, in the real world, is well documented and so while the leap may be a dramatic one, I\u2019ll go with it. A lot of the rationale behind China\u2019s diplomatic expansion into Africa has been about securing natural resources for Chinese industry. Congo is one of the world\u2019s richest countries in terms of mineral resource (just a bit of a bugger it\u2019s buried under all that rainforest). In Mr Robot, it seems, that hunger for resource is also consistent with WhiteRose\u2019s ambitions, including her wish that the Washington Plant keep running for example. We may not yet know for what end, but there is a strategy emerging. The (great) game is afoot.</p> <h2>Mother Superior jump the gun</h2> <p>To put it mildly, we\u2019re not used to seeing Elliot as a romantic lead. So to see him get clammy under the collar with not one but two women this week? Someone tell the sysadmin to pass me the smelling salts.</p> <p>To be fair, I\u2019m not entirely sure how much influence Joanna Wellick\u2019s potent sexuality had on our hero. Yes he went on to establish the source of her deep breathing phone calls, but I think that was more to do with the glowering presence of Mr Sutherland than Wellick fixing Elliot with a lingering look. In fact, during their moment together I was expecting Elliot to give it the \u201cAre you trying to seduce me Mrs Wellick?\u201d treatment, but sadly, no dice.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"97bf57cba51d1364a4fb7fe7b72d3650a263518d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/97bf57cba51d1364a4fb7fe7b72d3650a263518d/35_0_1033_620/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Blow me down if I wasn\u2019t cheering Elliot and Angela on as they smooched.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Blow me down if I wasn\u2019t cheering them on as they smooched.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Amazon</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Now that\u2019s to one side, let\u2019s concentrate on the childhood sweethearts finally acknowledging their feelings for each other with a fleeting kiss on the subway. Angela is a long way from the innocent woman we met at the beginning of season one. Elliot was never who we thought he was in the first place. Any romance between the pair seems unlikely therefore, but blow me down if I wasn\u2019t cheering them on as they smooched. In a series where almost everything ends up corrupted (including the hard drives) it was nice to feel a flicker of innocent hope. Not that it seems likely to last. When Elliot steps off the carriage, Angela is confronted by a silent couple whose faces we don\u2019t see. Such encounters don\u2019t normally end well.</p> <h2>Order v Chaos rating: 8</h2> <p>I\u2019m marking it down as the same as last week because, while there\u2019s an ominous sense of things being on the verge of collapse, there\u2019s no tangible evidence of things being worse. In fact, a pharmacy appears to be offering extended opening hours (to a sum total of four). Ok, it\u2019s pretty bad, but I need to leave some room lest things get <em>even </em>worse.</p> <h2>Self harm index: green</h2> <p>The question is not so much what Mr Robot is doing to Elliot, but where is Mr Robot? He disappears in the computer store and doesn\u2019t return, much to Elliot\u2019s confusion.

Social mobility, though a desirable outcome, should be secondary. The key question is whether brighter pupils do better in selective schools than in non-selective schools. Those who support grammar schools think so and most who oppose them point to the advantage such pupils gain, so there appears to be considerable agreement on this. What we need to ensure is that the non-selective schools do not suffer as a consequence. If there are relatively few grammar schools with wide catchment areas the dilution effect will be small.</p></div> </div> </div>  </figure>  <h2>\u2018Try telling my father grammar schools don\u2019t aid social mobility\u2019<br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-comment\" data-canonical-url=\"https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/82811683\">  <div class=\"d2-comment-embedded\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Comment\"> <div class=\"d2-left-col\"> <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/14968605\" title=\"View Cransley\u2019s profile\"> <img class=\"d2-avatar\" src=\"https://avatar.guim.co.uk/user/14968605\" height=\"40\" width=\"40\" alt=\"User avatar for Cransley\"> </a> </div> <div class=\"d2-right-col\"> <div itemscope itemprop=\"author\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"> <a class=\"d2-username\" href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/14968605\" title=\"View Cransley\u2019s profile\" itemprop=\"url\"> <span itemprop=\"givenName\">Cransley</span> </a> </div> <div class=\"d2-permalink\"> <a class=\"d2-datetime\" href=\"https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/82811683\" title=\"Link to this comment\" itemprop=\"datePublished\">08 September 2016 10:15am</a> </div> <div class=\"d2-body\" itemprop=\"text\"><p>My father was born in 1937, brought up by a single parent (his father went to fight in the war, and didn't come back) on a very low income, in an unheated slum (except for a small coal fire) in Liverpool with no bathroom and with flag-stones for flooring.

Like that piece, it\u2019s a comedy, based on <a href=\"https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems-and-poets/poets/detail/edith-sitwell\">Edith Sitwell</a>\u2019s 1933 assemblage of stories and anecdotes about the oddballs of British history. The opera has no narrative thread; its two acts consist of seven more or less independent scenes, each based on one or more of the vignettes from Sitwell\u2019s book.</p> <p>It\u2019s a strange mixture of the farcical and the vaguely pathetic. A self-obsessed fop attempts to play Romeo; a group of quacks have a meeting with Beau Brummel and his retinue; a rancorous military man attempts to write his memoirs. But there\u2019s nothing eccentric or comic, for instance, about the woman whose brother squanders her fortune and is later hanged for forgery, and there\u2019s something rather awkward and discomfiting now about the tale of the mysterious exotic stranger, Princess Caraboo, who appears on the doorstep of a couple in the West Country to general consternation, but is later outed as a housemaid from Devon.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bc4d7c6799ad5ea06df847d7eaae6992a7499a8b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bc4d7c6799ad5ea06df847d7eaae6992a7499a8b/0_279_4981_2990/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A scene from English Eccentrics by Malcolm Williamson.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A scene from English Eccentrics by Malcolm Williamson.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It all makes an inconsequential basis for an opera, and there\u2019s not much to take away. But the frieze-like construction is well suited to Williamson\u2019s incredibly fluent, quick-witted music, which can turn from the serious and Brittenesque to the style of the fluffiest musical revue at the drop of a crotchet, and which ends the whole opera with a feelgood chorus for the entire cast that would not be out of place in Les Mis\u00e9rables. All of it is executed with great economy \u2013 there are only six solo singers and a chorus of four, accompanied by an ensemble of seven players.</p> <p>Though it would have been interesting to see a production of one of Williamson\u2019s later, more serious stage works \u2013 two of his nine operas are based on Strindberg plays \u2013 it\u2019s easy to understand why BYO settled on English Eccentrics. The forces required are modest, and each member of the cast gets to play multiple roles, which they carry off with great energy and enthusiasm.

The remaining 14 serious cases were the result of human error.</p> <p>Burnton\u2019s annual report says the serious errors led to 17 cases in which people who were unconnected to a police investigation were either arrested or had property searched that had nothing to do with the inquiry.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/nov/25/police-scotland-criticised-for-breaching-law-to-spy-on-journalists-sources\">Police Scotland criticised for breaching law to spy on journalists' sources</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A further six innocent people were visited by police as a result of errors and there were delays to welfare checks on seven vulnerable people.</p> <p>The watchdog also identified four cases in which communications data was acquired to identify a journalist\u2019s source without judicial authorisation. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/nov/25/police-scotland-criticised-for-breaching-law-to-spy-on-journalists-sources\">In one high-profile case</a>, the watchdog found that Police Scotland had acted recklessly after the individuals concerned complained to the investigatory powers tribunal.</p> <p> In the other three cases the commissioner ruled that the conduct was \u201cnot wilful or reckless\u201d and \u201cdid not adversely affect any individual significantly\u201d.</p> <p>Burnton says 145 public authorities had access to confidential data in 2015; 93.7% of applications were made by police forces and law enforcement agencies. The security services were responsible for a further 5.7% of requests and local authorities and other public bodies for the remaining 0.6%.</p> <p>The report criticises the prison service for not having an adequate translation strategy in place to monitor the calls and correspondence of prisoners using foreign languages. \u201cThis was particularly relevant to those prisons with a high proportion of foreign national prisoners where a small number of inspections revealed that staff were being directed to listen to a large number of calls made in foreign languages but were not being provided with any guidance as to whether the calls should be translated,\u201d Burnton said.</p> <p>\u201cConsequently no benefit was being derived from the monitoring, which undermines the necessity and proportionality for it as the exercise cannot meet the objective for which monitoring was authorised.\u201d<br></p> <p>The 761,702 \u201citems of communications data\u201d include \u201cidentifiers\u201d such as mobile or landline numbers, email addresses or bank or credit card details. A request for incoming and outgoing call data on a particular mobile phone over 30 days is counted as one item of data.</p> <p>The watchdog also received 62 reports of errors related to the 3,059 interception warrants, which allow the police and security services to access the content of calls, emails, and other messages.</p> <p>These ranged from \u201cover-collection and unauthorised selection or examination of material to the interception of the wrong communications identifier or failure to cancel an interception\u201d.</p> <p>The prime minister, Theresa May, said Burnton\u2019s report \u2013 and a second from the intelligence services commissioner \u2013 recognised the diligence and rigour of those who use investigatory powers to keep Britain safe. \u201cBoth reports contain details of the recommendations that the commissioners have made to continue to improve the way that these powers are used. The public authorities who have received these recommendations will be giving careful consideration to them and how to further improve their processes,\u201d she said in a written statement to the Commons.</p>",

Smith says the programme will:</p> <ul> <li> invest billions in new housing;<br></li> <li>free up councils to borrow to build badly needed council homes;</li> <li>strengthen requirements on developers to fund more social rented homes.</li> </ul> <p>Since the government scrapped the section 106 obligation, which helped councils increase affordable homes for rent in new private developments, there has been no requirement for developers of small sites to fund socially rented homes at all.</p> <p>To fund his New Deal, Smith <a href=\"http://www.owen2016.com/only_owen_will_solve_the_housing_crisis\">highlights </a>the fact that borrowing costs are at their lowest rate in history. </p> <h2>First homes</h2> <p>To boost home ownership among young people, 50,000 of the 300,000 new homes Smith plans to build annually will be offered to first-time buyers under the age of 30 as a \u201cfirst home\u201d.</p> <p>Under Smith\u2019s scheme, people under 30 will rent a home at full market rates on tenancies of between five and eight years. Over this period, 20% of the rent will be \u201csaved\u201d in an unspecified manner. At the end of the tenancy, the first-time buyer would be able to buy the property outright at the market value that they moved in at (or the current value, whichever is lower) by using the savings as a deposit on the mortgage. The upfront cost of the scheme would be covered by the \u00a3200bn fund Smith\u2019s team have earmarked for infrastructure investment.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/housing-network/2016/aug/31/pay-to-stay-social-housing-hit-low-earners\">What is pay to stay and who will be affected?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>For example, if a couple moved into the average house in Catford, south-east London, worth \u00a3290,311, after five to eight years the scheme would allow them to purchase their home at its value when they moved in. With market rent at \u00a31,209 each month, if the couple save one fifth (\u00a3241) into the scheme, they would have saved \u00a323,212 after eight years. With the average first-time buyer needing a 17% deposit, that would still leave them more than \u00a326,000 short of the \u00a349,352 needed.</p> <h2>Tackling homelessness <br></h2> <p>Smith\u2019s ideas on homelessness include changing the law to provide a stronger safety net for single homeless people. Smith says he will invest \u00a350m a year to support outreach programmes for rough sleepers. He also wants to set-up a single government unit to co-ordinate action across the country.</p> <h2>Jeremy Corbyn </h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bd9e0faa09f6cad98e0f6c9211e12572e8f9bac5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bd9e0faa09f6cad98e0f6c9211e12572e8f9bac5/0_68_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn speaks during a press conference at The Royal Society of Arts\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn speaks during a press conference at The Royal Society of Arts.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Mirzoeff/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Building new homes</strong></h2> <p>Corbyn <a href=\"http://www.jeremyforlabour.com/homes\">says</a> that under his leadership, Labour will build \u201cat least a million new homes in five years, with at least half a million council homes, through our public investment strategy\u201d. </p> <p>The present Labour leader points out that while Britain needs 250,000 new homes each year, with the construction industry officially in recession increasing building will require a policy for the recovery of the industry. Corbyn says a new national investment bank will support new housing projects and act to develop the skilled workforce needed to deliver homebuilding now and in the future. </p> <p>Using estimates from KPMG and Shelter, the policy estimates that for every \u00a31 spent on housing construction, a further \u00a32.09 of economic output is generated, and 56p return to the exchequer, of which 36p constitutes direct savings in tax and benefits. </p> <p>In addition, Corbyn points to figures from the House Builders Federation, which estimates that for each home built, one and a half jobs are directly created, and a further two to four jobs are created in the wider supply chain. So a boost for housing construction will not only address housing need, but will also supplement the local and national economy.</p> <h2>Local authority mortgages</h2> <p>At a Labour economics conference in May 2016, shadow chancellor<em> </em>John McDonnell announced that Labour would seek to give local authorities mortgage lending powers. \u201cCouncils in Manchester, Warrington and Sandwell are offering cheap, local authority-backed mortgages to first-time buyers in particular.

  "<p>Only 12 days remain until voting closes in the leadership contest between Jeremy Corbyn and Owen Smith. Meanwhile, in places across England and Wales, a very different set of Labour politicians are grappling with the daily pressures of power. Sadiq Khan\u2019s recent win in London sealed Labour\u2019s control of all the major English cities, from Newcastle to Bristol \u2013 and the party is also in charge of sizeable places such as Hull, Oxford, Brighton and Southampton.

Labour\u2019s big hitters in city and local government often claim that they\u2019re marginalised by the party\u2019s national politicians. Just about every Labour council has to deal with ongoing austerity, changes to their funding from Whitehall are looming, and many are taking strides towards devolution. Those involved say that people at the top of the party could learn a lot, if only they would give the people who run cities the time of day, and a decent platform.</p> <p>Some of these people sound exasperated by the Smith/Corbyn battle: others, indeed, simply refuse to talk about it.

As she looks back at her party\u2019s drubbing at last year\u2019s general election, her conversational pace picks up. \u201cThere was no message of hope,\u201d she says. \u201cWhat was Labour offering us? What was going to be different? And then there was the austerity-lite message: \u2018We\u2019ll cut, but we won\u2019t cut quite as much.\u2019 That went down really badly.\u201d</p> <p>The arrival of Corbyn, I suggest, might have answered some of those points. \u201cI think it\u2019s answered some for the party membership, and the new people who\u2019ve come in,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I still think we\u2019re failing to get our message out into our communities.\u201d</p> <p>Blake has been the leader of Leeds city council since May last year, with Labour on 63 seats to the Tories\u2019 19, and the Lib Dems on nine. The financial struggle she and her colleagues are facing is mind-boggling: after cutting about \u00a3210m from the council\u2019s budgets since 2010, another \u00a3110m are yet to come.</p> <p> \u201cI\u2019m deeply frustrated about it all,\u201d she says. \u201cAngry. And then you get the deep insult of seeing other places [she means Tory-run councils, mostly in the south] gain funding because of the politics of it. We have to wake up to that, as a country.\u201d<br></p> <p>Blake is one of only two women who run big English cities (the other is Labour\u2019s Julie Dore, down the M1 in Sheffield). In last year\u2019s leadership contest, she voted for Yvette Cooper. \u201cI think there\u2019s a real gender issue in the party, I really do,\u201d she says. Her other frustration is just as plainly put. \u201cFor many, many years, local politicians in the Labour party have been saying: \u2018Listen to what we\u2019re saying. We are Labour in power.\u2019 There\u2019s too much disconnect: too many things being discussed nationally that don\u2019t resonate with people\u2019s lives.\u201d</p> <p>She and other Labour councillors have agreed to keep their views on the Smith/Corbyn contest to themselves. \u201cThere\u2019s a concern about holding everybody together,\u201d she says. \u201cThere have been some very extreme views expressed on both sides \u2026 and I think there\u2019s a whole issue about how we manage social media, which we haven\u2019t addressed. The situation is so raw in this part of Yorkshire because of [the late MP] Jo Cox.

Close up, politics in Milton Keynes is as fascinating as the cold, clinical cityscape that extends into the distance. Labour and the Tories are tied on 22 seats each, the former is in power thanks to a two-year agreement with the Lib Dems. \u201cIn new-build places, which is traditional sort of Blairite territory, we don\u2019t win,\u201d says Peter Marland, the council\u2019s Labour leader. \u201cThat\u2019s a massive issue.\u201d</p> <p>Marland is a 35-year-old native of Lancashire, with a blunt wit and a tendency to use colourful language. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a different set of problems from a traditional Labour council here,\u201d he tells me. \u201cWe\u2019re fast-growing. We\u2019re creating jobs. Our unemployment is 1.8%.\u201d</p> <p>But in some neighbourhoods, he says, average life expectancy is 14 years lower than it is 10 minutes down the road. \u201cAnd like a lot of places, we\u2019re having to deal with cuts,\u201d he says. \u201cBut there\u2019s also a massive increase in population as well.\u201d As new arrivals come here to live, the frontier people who pitched up in the 70s and 80s are hitting old age, so spending is being squeezed at both ends of the age range. The number of local dementia diagnoses, Marland says, is going up by 40% annually, and at the same time the council is building 12 new schools a year.</p> <p>There are profound lessons in all this for Labour, but Marland says he is disappointed by the tenor of the leadership debate. \u201cThey\u2019re having a conversation with themselves, aren\u2019t they?\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s too mid-20th century.\u201d The actions of anti-Corbyn MPs \u201chave been bizarre, but the actions of some of the people around Corbyn have been equally bizarre\u201d. He says he is set on remaining neutral, though if he was forced to chose, he would probably vote for Smith \u2013 a matter, he says, of \u201celectability\u201d.</p> <p>But he also talks in positive terms about Corbyn. In 2015, Marland was publicly sceptical, claiming he would cost Labour \u201ccouncillors and credibility\u201d. Now, he talks energetically about local Labour membership having gone up from about 600 to 2,000. \u201cCorbyn is saying some of the things a Labour party person should be saying. Haven\u2019t people been let down by the banks? Haven\u2019t people been let down by the fact that they work fucking hard in Sports Direct, and then don\u2019t have a job?\u201d</p> <p>Milton Keynes\u2019s next elections are in 2018. Marland talks about staying in power in terms of pushing local stories, but what if it is out of his hands, and down to the party\u2019s fate nationally? He has an answer, but it sounds more like the a matter of hope than certainty. \u201cIt needn\u2019t always be about what\u2019s on the six o\u2019clock news,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you\u2019re using your local power well, I genuinely think that people will support you.\u201d</p> <h2>Newcastle: \u2018The debate has sunk to lows I wouldn\u2019t have expected\u2019<br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"05e6546d3282dca1ebe3f00fa71e9885d1e35fe4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/05e6546d3282dca1ebe3f00fa71e9885d1e35fe4/0_192_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Newcastle council leader Nick Forbes.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Newcastle council leader Nick Forbes.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Nick Forbes has been Labour\u2019s leader in Newcastle since the party snatched back power from the Lib Dems five years ago. He traces Labour\u2019s current national crisis back to the same time: 2010, to be exact, when Ed Miliband won the Labour leadership, without much a sense of the party taking a long, hard look at itself. Instead, he says, \u201cpeople retreated into a tribal mentality\u201d \u2013 something he says applies just as much to the current contest. \u201cIt\u2019s all seen through the lens of, \u2018Which tribe do you belong to within Labour?\u2019 not, \u2018What is the Labour party here for?\u2019</p> <p>\u201cIt all feels like an indulgence,\u201d he says. Like Blake, he won\u2019t be drawn on whether he will vote for Corbyn or Smith, though he uses one of the tropes favoured by people who have had enough of the leadership regime: \u201cMy view is that Labour has to be seen as a party of government, not a protest movement.\u201d</p> <p>If some of Labour\u2019s city leaders are trying to avert their eyes from the party\u2019s national problems, Forbes has no choice but to look at them closely. As well as being the leader of the Labour group of the local government association, he has just been elected as one of two representatives of city and local government on the party\u2019s national executive committee. </p> <p>\u201cOne of the things I\u2019m genuinely worried about is the way the internal debate has sunk to lows that I wouldn\u2019t have expected from any political party, let alone a party that claims to be inclusive and progressive,\u201d he says. \u201cThe levels of abuse that I\u2019ve seen friends and colleagues receive has been shocking. <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/sadiq-khan-booed-at-jeremy-corbyn-rally-a7203241.html\">Booing Sadiq Khan?</a>  I find that absolutely appalling.\u201d</p> <p>In Newcastle, austerity is grinding on. In many of its neighbourhoods, says Forbes, Ukip has recently started coming second, and he knows why. \u201cThe cuts have provided them with a useful narrative against Labour: \u2018Why are your streets not being swept? Why can\u2019t you get a house?\u2019 We saw a lot of that in the EU referendum campaign. It was entirely predictable that people used the referendum as a cry of outrage against years of austerity.\u201d</p> <p>Over the last year, he adds, a new source of hostility to his administration has reared its head \u2013 from people within Labour whose interpretation of it as an \u201canti-austerity party\u201d sees them protesting against Labour councils.</p> <p>\u201cWe get it twice,\u201d he says. \u201cWe get it once from the government, and then we get it from certain sections of our own party, campaigning against what we\u2019re having to do.\u201d Not for the first time he sounds frustrated beyond words. \u201cWhere is the solidarity with Labour councillors who are having to make the most difficult decisions?\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Digital products are weird: they are inert without software to animate them, and software is so technologically and legally weird that it can be very hard to know exactly what you\u2019re buying. </p> <p>But there just might be some clarity on the horizon, thanks to documents I recently filed with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), signed by the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), several publishers and public interest groups and 20 EFF supporters with important (and alarming!) stories to tell. </p> <p> In 1998, the US Congress enacted the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), whose Section 1201 makes it a felony to bypass or tamper with \u201caccess controls\u201d (today we call these \u201cDRM\u201d or \u201cdigital rights management\u201d). Originally this was used to ensure that no one reconfigured their games console to play unofficial games (meaning that the console maker could extract fees from games companies without fear of competition) and that DVD players weren\u2019t modified to play out-of-region discs. But software proliferated and the DMCA wasn\u2019t far behind. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/nov/17/ebooks-new-reading-drm-digital-rights-management-digimarc-brein\">Digital rights management: it\u2019s not as if wanting to read is a crime</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Manufacturers of all descriptions realised they could control competition and create a powerful, state-enforced lock-in by skinning their products with DRM, and DRM crept into cat-litter pans, thermostats, cars, tractors, voting machines, coffee machines, pacemakers, and, of course, ebooks, video games, music and videos. Add DRM to a car and you can control which mechanics can access its diagnostics and fix it. </p> <p>Add DRM to, say, a cat-litter pan and you can force customers to buy fresh perfume cartridges on the regular, ensuring a continuing revenue stream \u2013 any attempt to bypass the perfume-checking function (refilling the cartridge with unscented water, replacing it with a third-party cartridge) can be detected with software and stopped cold. Any customer or competitor who bypasses the system is a potential felon. </p> <p>What for-profit company <em>wouldn\u2019t</em> take advantage of such a sweet offer from the government? I\u2019ve battled DRM for decades. It offends me because I believe that when you buy things, you should be able to use and adapt them in ways that suit your needs, even if that cuts into the bottom line of the manufacturer. It <em>scares</em> me, too: laws like DMCA 1201 have been used to punish and threaten security professionals who have revealed defects in products. </p> <p>As DRM creeps into products that we literally entrust with our lives, we absolutely cannot afford to have structural impediments to the speedy disclosure of information about defects that make those products unfit for use. </p> <p>When you fight DRM, its advocates will tell you that people don\u2019t mind DRM \u2013 after all, look at all the DRM-encumbered products they buy! It\u2019s true that a lot of people buy DRM-locked products, but that doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t mind it. It could just as easily mean that they don\u2019t realise that they\u2019re getting DRM when they buy, or that they don\u2019t know which DRM they\u2019re getting and what it does. </p> <p>In <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/files/2016/08/06/eff_request_for_investigation_re_labeling_drm-limited_products.pdf\">EFF\u2019s request for an FTC investigation</a> into DRM labelling practices, we highlight the stories of 20 Americans who bought products where they were not notified of the existence of DRM \u2013 or were partially notified, but with insufficient detail about what the DRM was taking away from them. These people found that the games they bought permanently disabled their DVD recorder drives, or that their travel books couldn\u2019t be read while travelling, or that the videos they purchased wouldn\u2019t play back on their monitors or in their classrooms. </p> <p> In our <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/document/eff-letter-ftc-re-drm-labeling\">open letter on DRM labelling</a> \u2013 a letter signed by a diverse coalition of rights holders, public interest groups, and publishers \u2013 we ask the FTC to take action to ensure that people know what they\u2019re getting when they buy products encumbered with DRM. DRM-free publishers love this idea, because where DRM-labelling prevails, customers overwhelmingly <a href=\"http://boingboing.net/2014/07/19/drm-free-indie-ebooks-outsell.html\">favour DRM-free products</a>. </p> <p>But DRM-encumbered publishers should <em>also</em> love this, because they keep telling us that people don\u2019t mind DRM. One significant challenge to DRM labelling is that the restrictions imposed by DRM can be incredibly complex \u2013 a video may play back on most manufacturers\u2019 displays, but not all, and not at every resolution, and not if the video player believes that it is running in a virtual machine or has been relocated to a different country. </p> <p> What\u2019s more, most modern DRM is designed for \u201crenewability\u201d \u2013 which is a DRM-vendor euphemism for a remote kill-switch. These DRM tools phone home periodically for updates, and install these updates without user intervention, and then disable some or all of the features that were there when you bought the product. </p> <p>Apple repeatedly did this with iTunes, while Nintendo <a href=\"http://boingboing.net/2011/05/17/nintendo-3ds-license.html\">designed the 3DS game system to render itself permanently inoperable</a> if an update detected evidence of tampering. This means that any solution the FTC comes up with will require extensive disclosures from the more baroque DRM schemes \u2013 which is as it should be. You can\u2019t consent without being informed, and the entire basis for taking away our rights with DRM products is that we\u2019re consenting when we \u201cchoose DRM\u201d. All of this is just a sticking plaster, of course. </p> <p>The real solution is to reform the laws that protect DRM \u2013 DMCA 1201 in the US, EUCD Article 6 in the EU, among others \u2013 to ensure that doing legal things with your own property remains legal. The fact that this principle needs legal protection tells you how bonkers the whole thing is. That\u2019s why <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jul/21/digital-millennium-copyright-act-eff-supreme-court\">EFF has filed a lawsuit against the US government</a> seeking to invalidate Section 1201 of the DMCA. </p> <p>Until that judgment is in, though, labelling serves an important purpose: warning customers when they\u2019re buying a product that\u2019s defective by design.</p>",
  "<p>The harm we cause one another \u2013 casually, accidentally, deliberately, unknowingly \u2013 haunts Rowan Hisayo Buchanan\u2019s mind. Her debut novel, Harmless Like You, which sparked a fierce bidding war among publishers, takes its title from a photography series that Yuki, one of Buchanan\u2019s main characters, puts together in the early 1970s. The series is made up of pictures taken on the sly of girls around New York City: brown, black, Asian girls, and one of a white American darling, complete with ringlets, rosy cheeks and a copy of the 11 June 1972 edition of the New York Times, with the now-famous <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/apr/30/40-years-since-saigons-fall-napalm-attack-haunts-woman-in-iconic-image\">Napalm Girl</a>, Phan Thi Kim Phuc, on the front cover. </p> <p>The title of Yuki\u2019s series, in turn, comes from something her lover Lou says to her: \u201cI think the real cowards are the ones over there killing harmless little girls like you.\u201d It is a painful comparison; not only is Yuki Japanese, not Vietnamese, but he is grossly underestimating her.</p> <p>\u201cThe idea of harmlessness is fascinating to me,\u201d Buchanan says. \u201cA bully will call something harmless teasing or a little harmless fun, when actually it\u2019s hugely harmful.\u201d Lou is a bully, but familiar pain is far more comforting to Yuki than unfamiliar tenderness. Though Yuki spends most of her youth in the US, her Japanese father spent time in an internment camp, and still hates the States. </p> <p>\u201cA lot of what the book is about is how pain shape-shifts down the generations. There is nothing more personal than family, and yet families are so profoundly affected by political decisions,\u201d Buchanan says. Yuki, an American citizen, remains in the US when her parents return to Japan, determined to finish high school and attend college, but instead drops out and begins a job that fills her days with fluff. She is rootless, even when she finds herself a home of sorts with Lou, surrounded by people who look nothing like her.</p> <p>Buchanan, daughter of a Japanese-Chinese American mother and white British father, used to only write white characters. \u201cThe standard character was a white person,\u201d she says. \u201cI get really excited when I read writers who write people who, let\u2019s be honest, don\u2019t have my exact racial makeup but who are mixed-up in that way. I wanted to start writing characters like that.\u201d But she discovered an unseen challenge while writing short stories: a simple last name provided no clues for readers to imagine ethnicity or background. \u201cYou end up having to give these mini-histories. It can be quite challenging, especially in a short story, to get that information across in a way that feels natural.\u201d</p> <p>In Harmless Like You, Buchanan had a whole novel in which to explore Japanese-American Yuki and her son, Jay. Both characters look for ways to reconcile themselves with their histories, though in vastly different and sometimes opposing ways. Yuki left her parents voluntarily; but Jay, a toddler when Yuki leaves, is half-orphaned through no choice of his own. Where Yuki\u2019s introspection is focused on the harm she causes to the world, even while being harmed constantly, Jay sees the harm others inflict on him \u2013 his mother, his father, his wife, even his newborn daughter.</p> <p>When asked whether the political messaging that comes through from these events \u2013 hereditary trauma, the politics of motherhood, the gender politics that shadow women who leave their family and men who become a single dad \u2013 Buchanan demurs: \u201cTo borrow the 1960s and 70s feminist slogan, the personal is political. It wasn\u2019t that I tied the personal to the political, it was that I couldn\u2019t tear them apart.\u201d</p> <p>Like her characters, Buchanan inherited her sense of home from her family. Her father, of Scottish heritage, grew up in England. Her Japanese and Chinese grandparents met in the US and stayed there, as in their countries it would have been harder to get married, unlike in New York where, as Buchanan\u2019s grandmother put it, \u201cJews were marrying Catholics\u201d. Her American mother moved to England to be with Buchanan\u2019s father, and she \u201cmissed New York a lot. A lot, a lot,\u201d Buchanan stresses. </p> <p>And so Buchanan spent her life living alternately in London and New York, each time missing the other place, feeling as if there was more home there than here. \u201cOn the good days, I feel like I have many homes. On the bad days, I feel like I have no home,\u201d she says. When she talks, her speech works musically between accents, often affected by the country she\u2019s in (though she does, she admits, sound more British when cross).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"20d97b8a1f6da22781e5cde9b060c68e06e8124f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/20d97b8a1f6da22781e5cde9b060c68e06e8124f/1442_0_3072_3840/800.jpg\" alt=\"Rowan Hisayo Buchanan, pictured at the 2016 Edinburgh international books festival.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rowan Hisayo Buchanan, pictured at the 2016 Edinburgh international books festival.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo Macleod/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Several years ago, Buchanan\u2019s mother was affected by something called transient global amnesia. \u201cShe woke up one morning and forgot where she was, her age, the year, the country. She was in London. I was in New York. We didn\u2019t know it was TGA then.\u201d Buchanan laughs; once they found out what it was, she and her family agreed that it sounded like \u201ca really bad budget airline\u201d. TGA causes sudden memory loss and symptoms similar to an epileptic seizure or stroke. The syndrome\u2019s name is strangely apt: Buchanan\u2019s mother, like her daughter, is transient, visiting the US often, travelling across the globe between each of the two places she\u2019s called home. But it wasn\u2019t so much her life \u2013 though Yuki is Buchanan\u2019s mother\u2019s age \u2013 but rather the fear of her mother not existing any more that began the gestation of Harmless Like You. </p> <p>\u201cI thought I might have lost my mother,\u201d Buchanan says. \u201cI couldn\u2019t leave the apartment. I sat by my phone and freaked out. I didn\u2019t understand who I would be if she\u2019d never been in my life. Later, when I found out my mother was OK, I started to write a very different story \u2013 one where the mother does leave.\u201d</p> <p>In the month since the novel came out in the UK, Buchanan has been experiencing her own desertion issues. The book\u2019s cover features Yuki\u2019s face with a paint splatter blurring out her eyes. \u201cEvery time I see her in a bookshop, I feel like I\u2019m abandoning her. That I\u2019ve left her exposed in the playground, to see if people will like her, want to be her friend or ignore her and leave her alone,\u201d Buchanan laughs. \u201cI recognise this is totally psychologically revealing of me more than of her.\u201d</p> <ul> <li>Harmless Like You (Sceptre, RRP \u00a314.99) is available from the <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/harmless-like-you.html\">Guardian Bookshop</a> for \u00a312.29.</li> </ul>",

  "<p>Cycling through Venice for the first time in several years, I couldn\u2019t help but notice this proudly laid-back beachfront town west of Los Angeles is gradually being remade in jauntily angled boxes of concrete, steel and glass. New wealth is pouring into what was once a slightly scuffed and sleepy neighbourhood, a place that celebrated barefoot living in low-slung wooden cottages.</p> <p>The style of the new modernist mini-mansions is strongly reminiscent of one man: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/frank-gehry\">Frank Gehry</a>, who has a long and abiding connection to Venice. The architect whose buildings are said to revitalise whole cities has been experimenting with manipulating form and materials in Los Angeles for more than 30 years. The angular forms and everyday materials (corrugated metal, chain-link fencing) of his family home, built in 1978 in nearby Santa Monica, has bubbled its way up into his classic buildings: the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/apr/30/bilbao-effect-gehry-guggenheim-history-cities-50-buildings\">Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao</a>, or the Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles.</p> <p>For decades, Venice has been not just where Gehry\u2019s artist and architect friends lived, but where he made some of his most cutting-edge work. In this neighbourhood of charming, cramped cottages, of back alleys overgrown with cactus and bougainvillea and long-forgotten basketball hoops, of hummingbirds zipping in and out of the foliage, Gehry\u2019s bold designs have always stood out. </p> <p>Now, however, cement walls and austere fencing are rising throughout the neighbourhood, shielding new, bespoke, futuristic beach homes \u2013 just like minor-league Gehrys. With Gehry himself now building a new home in Venice, I decided to see it for myself; armed with newspaper clippings and clues from the internet, I set out on my bike to find it, hoping to get the measure of what is, by all accounts, one of Los Angeles\u2019s strangest neighbourhoods.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5c2b73eaecd631452de8697278d7867dbccada27\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5c2b73eaecd631452de8697278d7867dbccada27/0_0_2778_1854/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The boardwalk at Venice, California\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The boardwalk at Venice beach: home to tourists, street performers and Schwarzenegger\u2019s old body-building haunt.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stephen McLaren</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>From oil town to countercultural hideaway to weightlifting exhibitionist paradise, Venice has seen more re-inventions than a Hollywood C-lister. It has beguiled luminaries from Jim Morrison to Arnold Schwarzenegger and Julia Roberts, but has also struggled with homelessness and violent crime. Its latest wheeze is secession from Los Angeles entirely: \u201cVexit\u201d is being pitched as a way of regaining control of public services and property taxes from Los Angeles, which some regard as domineering and unresponsive to local needs.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2010/jan/31/losangeles-california\">Venice has always had a lot going for it</a>. With ultra wide-angle views of the Pacific Ocean and its improbably broad golden beaches, it is perfect for residents who enjoy being close to LA but not <em>too</em> close, and for tourists who make it the second most visited location in the region after Disneyland. The famous boardwalk has always been a rough frontier, from which the more genteel part of LA recoiled with embarrassment: freakshows, drum circles and Schwarzenegger\u2019s old body-building haunt Muscle Beach. Now it is also a home to wealthy non-conformists, who have built ostentatious mini-mansions overlooking the cycle path.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"e4c2af1572ebb137004aff16c1a63e33819aa1d0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e4c2af1572ebb137004aff16c1a63e33819aa1d0/0_0_1335_2000/668.jpg\" alt=\"The Norton House in Venice California designed by Frank Gehry\" width=\"668\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Norton House in Venice, California, designed by Frank Gehry.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stephen McLaren</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Originally conceived as a west coast facsimile of its Adriatic namesake, Venice has also slugged it out as a seaside resort for cheap thrills and, in its most recent guise, a suburban idyll for hi-tech executives at nearby Silicon Beach.

Newspaper reports from 12 years ago describe a rare triple lot, shaded by a huge palm tree and a fir tree.<br></p> <p>Crisscrossing Venice\u2019s myriad back alleys and lanes, I quickly found myself with a flat tyre, and rolled my bike into Lance \u201cThe Bike Whisperer\u201d Small\u2019s repair store. As a long-time Venice resident, Lance has seen a lot of violence here, especially in the 1980s and 90s when a crack epidemic saw rival gangs fight it out on his doorstep. Things have been calmer in recent years as a result of gentrification, a development he broadly welcomes \u2013 though he says the newcomers and their architect-designed homes are threatening the neighbourly spirit he remembers. </p> <p>\u201cAll these people are used to working and living behind walls, whether it is in their cubicle at work or in their condos, or whatever,\u201d he says. \u201cSo the first thing they do when they move here is build a wall so we can\u2019t see them. What happens though when someone gets over the wall and is robbing their home? Now I can\u2019t see in there, so I can\u2019t tell what\u2019s going on, and won\u2019t be calling the police.\u201d</p> <p>The new wealth is one of the main reasons for Vexit, the term used by the neighbourhood council to canvass support for the secession of Venice from LA. They argue that poorer districts are benefitting unfairly from the huge amounts of property taxes that their rich enclave now contributes to the city\u2019s budget. </p> <p>Despite highly visible wealth, Venice frets over its own social problems, such as homelessness and drug use among the large transient community frequenting the gaudy boardwalk area. There is also a prevailing view here that these problems are not being dealt with seriously by the Los Angeles municipality. Ironically, in 1925 it was Venice, then an independent municipality, that had to be bailed out by LA when it went bankrupt.</p> <p>The place has always had an independent spirit. Though ignored by the nascent movie industry, it was conceived by tobacco baron Abbot Kinney as a cultural powerhouse to rival Venice in Italy in the early 1900s. Kinney dug canals, installed gondoliers, built Italianate shopping arcades and imported arts and culture to the beachfront and marshlands that marked LA\u2019s Pacific boundary. Venice of America, as it was then called, even boasted a Venetian-style \u201cgrand lagoon\u201d, which is now a bizarre traffic roundabout dotted with surreal statuary. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c86a2e5946270d19f38ee13a5cacb7f55f32932d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c86a2e5946270d19f38ee13a5cacb7f55f32932d/0_0_5260_3537/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Frank Gehry and his son in front of his home, Santa Monica.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"672\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Frank Gehry and his son, Alejandro, in front of his home in Santa Monica in January 1980.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Susan Wood/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Hundreds of midwestern families flocked to this new paradise in the sun, buying plots and erecting neat little beach huts; so too did movie stars of the silent era such as Fatty Arbuckle and Charlie Chaplin.</p> <p>When the performers and lecturers he employed to add culture to the beach didn\u2019t draw the expected crowds, Kinney imported a gaudy set of seaside attractions to rival Coney Island. The strategy worked: throughout the 1920s, and to the consternation of many residents, pleasure piers and carnival barkers made Venice a major draw for Angelenos at weekends and holidays. It was the Disneyland of its day.</p> <p>In 1929, drillers struck oil, and a new chapter for Venice as a petro-boomtown began. Hundreds of nodding oil-pumping derricks bristled over much of the coastline, producing more than 40,000 barrels a day. The Great Depression and second world war hit hard, however, and by the 1950s the town needed a new identity. <br></p> <p>It found it with an influx of Beat poets in the 1950s, followed by hippies enjoying the cheap rents and \u201canything goes\u201d approach afforded by life at the beach. The town entered an era of bacchanalian notoriety. Jim Morrison of the Doors wrote several of his hit songs on LSD in his rooftop apartment overlooking the ocean. Janis Joplin spent time in Venice partying hard and portraying herself as a beatnik. The cheap light industrial units helped 1970s Venice welcome a new generation of painters and artists, whose use of over-the-counter materials and utilisation of craft skills made for large-scale pop art creations.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"7b67e123bffb2fee1f10056e5817e28d369bf633\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7b67e123bffb2fee1f10056e5817e28d369bf633/0_31_1024_614/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A tattood man on the boardwalk in Venice California\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A tattood man on the boardwalk in Venice, California.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stephen McLaren</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Gehry was a friend to many of them, and built houses for some, including Chuck Arnoldi and Lynn Norton. He revelled in using humble materials, such as plywood and concrete, and rebelled against the modernist orthodoxy in architecture in which form was to follow function and straight lines were the benchmark for elegance. Having dabbled in jewellery and sculpture, he began to incorporate artistic motifs and gestures into his designs.<br></p> <p>Norton House is one of the most daring expressions of the de-constructed design ethos Gehry was pursuing in the 1980s. Squeezed into a beach-front row of bizarre and vain-looking mansions, it is Gehry\u2019s implausible creation which still draws the gawkers, with its strange interlocking units and playful sculptural touches. Just down the beach, along this stretch of sand, other avant-garde architects have had a go at matching Norton House\u2019s whimsical and pretension-free salute to the Pacific.

  "<p>There was a time when changing the appearance of a woman in a photograph would take hours and hours of expert, painstaking work by hand. Techniques in the darkroom allowed 20th-century photo editors to \u201cdodge\u201d or \u201cburn\u201d: over- or under-expose images in order to remove \u201cflaws\u201d, such as fine lines or rippling pockets of fat. Retouching required specialist equipment \u2013 paints, gelatine, brushes.</p> <p>Towards the end of the century, Photoshop transformed the way image manipulation was conducted, but nonetheless it still required time and skill from trained professionals, and the software was expensive.</p> <p>Now, thanks to the rapid rate at which software has developed, anyone can retouch a photograph of themselves in a matter of seconds. Powerful phone apps have, to an extent, democratised photography, in that people can experiment creatively with the images they produce without forking out money for expensive equipment or spending hours hunched over a magnifier. The history of the medium tells us that photographic images have been doctored since its very inception. It is nothing new. But still, there is a dark side to the way retouching is used, especially when it\u2019s on women\u2019s bodies.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"439c100b5f6a2ea2e9c74bb69d5f4e443c458efb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/439c100b5f6a2ea2e9c74bb69d5f4e443c458efb/7_0_2864_1718/1000.jpg\" alt=\"There is an element of narcissism in selfie culture, even if it is one largely rooted in insecurity.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">There is an element of narcissism in selfie culture, even if it is one largely rooted in insecurity.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Ellie Foreman-Peck</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At a recent barbecue, a friend showed me how you can doctor your Instagram photos using an app. At the touch of a button, she smoothed skin and slimmed limbs, adjusted contrast and lighting, airbrushed out \u201cimperfections\u201d.</p> <p>This girl, by the way, is sensationally beautiful: the kind of girl men follow around rooms like cartoon dogs drooling over a dangled pork chop.

But this is about so much more than the fashion industry now.</p> <p>Retouching and airbrushing are rife not just among the glossy pages of magazines but also on social media platforms such as Instagram \u2013 platforms that make claims of veracity and authenticity despite attempts by teenagers such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/nov/03/instagram-star-essena-oneill-quits-2d-life-to-reveal-true-story-behind-images\">Essena O\u2019Neill to reveal the truth</a> behind the images.</p> <p>Some phones now even do the work for you.

This is an endeavour that uses the girls\u2019 own experiences to try to counteract damaging media narratives.

Everyone does it, in other words, but no one admits to it.</p> <p>The result is huge damage to the confidence of young women.

Humans have always been narcissists \u2013 they just didn\u2019t have the technology to facilitate it. And everyone else wasn\u2019t doing it too, egging you on, making you feel worthless if you didn\u2019t participate.</p> <p>Now it is worse than ever. These girls sit on their devices, entranced by a universe in which they feel as though they matter, and they are increasingly unreachable.

It\u2019s 2016 and women feel as if they should be treated as more than glorified incubators. Who knew? There were also some suggestions that maybe the government should focus less on reminding women about their ovaries and more on trying to fix issues such as unemployment, paid maternity leave and poor childcare provisions.</p> <p>Italy\u2019s fertility publicity may not have worked as intended but it has done a good job of advertising the extent to which women\u2019s bodies are still carefully controlled under the guise of public health advice. So, to ensure you are all up to speed with the latest developments on how to safely operate your lady-body, here are a few more examples of campaigns demonstrating an unhealthy interest in women\u2019s health.</p> <h2>Booze and babies </h2> <p>Mixing alcohol with oestrogen, women are frequently told, is a recipe for disaster. Drinking will get us raped and/or give us herpes for starters. And if that\u2019s not enough to get you to put that glass of merlot down, then won\u2019t you think of the unborn children? Earlier this year, America\u2019s Center for Disease Control and Prevention caused widespread ire when it basically said that <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2016/p0202-alcohol-exposed-pregnancy.html\">fertile women shouldn\u2019t be drinking unless they were on birth control</a>. A press release explained: \u201cAlcohol can permanently harm a developing baby before a woman knows she is pregnant. About half of all pregnancies in the United States are unplanned, and even if planned, most women won\u2019t know they are pregnant for the first month or so, when they might still be drinking. The risk is real. Why take the chance?\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019ve also heard that walking down the street puts you in danger of getting struck by a car. The risk is real. Of course, I don\u2019t mean to underplay foetal alcohol syndrome, but this advice seems to greatly underplay women\u2019s common sense. What\u2019s more, it\u2019s based on highly dubious evidence. A number of studies have shown that light and occasional drinking poses little risk to pregnant women, or their foetuses. In any case, the most frustrating thing about the constant flow of moralising about women and drink is how one-sided it is. There\u2019s been very little health advice to men, after all, about how that one sip of Stella is going to turn you into a rapist with raging syphilis.</p> <h2>Making breast cancer sexy again </h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"154a6391adfc6fc07baedcea8b74265c6529be5e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/154a6391adfc6fc07baedcea8b74265c6529be5e/0_0_1001_1001/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Save Second Base T-shirt.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Save Second Base T-shirt.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Save Second Base</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women worldwide, so it makes sense that a large amount of women\u2019s health advice centres on our breasts. What makes less sense, however, is just how fixated on breasts these health campaigns often are. There have been a slew of \u201cprovocative\u201d awareness campaigns centred on messages such as <a href=\"https://surgegettysburg.wordpress.com/2013/09/30/i-dont-want-to-save-second-base/\">\u201cSave Second Base\u201d</a> and <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/lara-huffman/my-disease-isnt-a-cutesy-slogan_b_5853184.html\">\u201cSave the Ta Tas\u201d</a>, for example. </p> <p>And if breast cancer campaigns aren\u2019t drowning in tired innuendo about, giggle, boobs, giggle, then they tend not to think further than pink. Indeed, <a href=\"http://bcaction.org/2014/09/30/think-before-you-pink-stop-the-distraction/\">Breast Cancer Action has even coined the term \u201cpinkwashing\u201d</a>. It defines a pinkwasher as \u201ca company or organisation that claims to care about breast cancer by promoting a pink ribbon product, but at the same time produces, manufactures and/or sells products that are linked to the disease\u201d.</p> <h2>Superficial smoking campaigns </h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7f60e6812add1da626e09edc0d53ed23b8a4418e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7f60e6812add1da626e09edc0d53ed23b8a4418e/14_0_1120_672/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A Queensland Government anti-smoking campaign\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Go smoke free.

Stay pretty.\u201d Women are invited to \u201cupload a pic to the Future You Smoking Booth and see how old and horrible you could look if you keep smoking.

For example: \u201cBuy a drink for a marginally good-looking girl, only to find out she\u2019s chatty, clingy and your boss\u2019s daughter.\u201d Imagine, guys, after drunkenly crashing your car you could wake up to find yourself with horrible injuries and the terrible realisation that you\u2019d made out with an ugly girl!</p> <h2>The campaign you haven\u2019t seen yet </h2> <p>More egregious than any of these campaigns are the ones that don\u2019t exist yet. While a large amount of energy is expended on moralising about women\u2019s bodies, there is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/apr/20/tampon-safety-research-legislation\">still a shocking lack of research around many women\u2019s health issues</a>. For instance, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/mar/21/tampon-health-concerns-toxic-shock-syndrome-menstruation-women\">nobody knows exactly how harmful tampons might be because there has been very little research done</a>. Ridiculous as it may seem, this would appear to come down to simple squeamishness and embarrassment \u2013 society has made menstruation so taboo that science doesn\u2019t want to go near it. (The research that has been done has largely been funded by tampon companies, who \u2013 one imagines \u2013 aren\u2019t entirely unbiased.) </p> <p>What\u2019s more, much <a href=\"http://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/women-suffer-as-medical-research-focuses-on-men-8cnvfj6pb\">medical research still focuses on men</a> and neglects to properly control for female-specific differences. I know, it\u2019s depressing, right? Still, I\u2019m going to have to advise you not to take solace in a glass of wine, particularly if you\u2019re not on birth control. It\u2019s for your own good.</p>",
  "<p>It was, critics might suggest, the kind of aggressive and bizarre political stunt that could only come from the Donald Trump playbook.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>But when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/sep/09/chris-christie-gridlocked-bridgegate-united-airlines-ceo\">an epic traffic jam</a> was deliberately conjured on the world\u2019s busiest bridge to spite a mayor over a non-endorsement, Trump was still better known as a reality TV star across the river.</p> <p>The 2013 scandal dubbed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/04/chris-christies-office-refusing-to-release-bridgegate-emails\">\u201cBridgegate\u201d</a>, in which two former allies of New Jersey <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/nov/06/chris-christie-career-hurricane-sandy-bridgegate\">governor Chris Christie</a> were accused of deliberately sowing chaos on the George Washington Bridge, finally reaches trial on Thursday with jury selection.</p> <p>Christie endorsed Trump as early as February, when the Republican nomination was still up for grabs, and has since been a loyal surrogate, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/19/chris-christie-republican-national-convention-hillary-speech\">attack dog</a> and umbrella carrier. He missed out on being Trump\u2019s running mate but is chairman of his transition team and has been tipped as a possible attorney general in a Trump administration.</p> <p>Christie has not been charged over the bridge imbroglio, but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/10/chris-christie-lied-bridgegate-aide-staff\">questions linger over how much he knew</a> and it dealt a major blow to his own presidential hopes. In a Republican primary debate last December, when Christie said he would order US forces to shoot down Russian aircraft over Syria, rival Rand Paul shot back: \u201cWhen we think about the judgment of someone who might want world war three, we might think about someone who might shut down a bridge because they don\u2019t like their friends.\u201d</p> <p>Now the timing of the trial is a headache that Trump, already mired in numerous controversies, could do without in the last stretch of the presidential election.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"aaf1d8f6c6e0d59b5744ad9ce96f6eb4c4c3711a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aaf1d8f6c6e0d59b5744ad9ce96f6eb4c4c3711a/0_0_4657_3078/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The timing of the Bridgegate trial is a headache that Trump, already mired in numerous controversies, could do without in the last stretch of the presidential election.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"661\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The timing of the Bridgegate trial is a headache that Trump, already mired in numerous controversies, could do without in the last stretch of the presidential election.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: LM Otero/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Yet the weirdness of the incident is in keeping with the most unorthodox election campaign in decades. The Port Authority\u2019s police department in Fort Lee, New Jersey, moved traffic cones without warning, forcing three lanes of cars through a single toll booth at the foot of the George Washington Bridge, which connects to New York. They chose the first day of the school year in Fort Lee for maximum impact. Commuters and students were gridlocked for hours, and emergency workers could not respond to calls. The lanes were shut for four days.</p> <p>\u201cIt was unbelievable,\u201d said <a href=\"https://twitter.com/rickwtyler?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Rick Tyler</a>, a former spokesman for Ted Cruz, who ran against Trump and Christie in the Republican primaries. \u201cI\u2019ve been across the George Washington Bridge. I think I would have just removed the barricades and driven on.\u201d</p> <p>For a while, agency officials claimed that the operation had been a botched traffic study, but in early January 2014, leaked emails suggested a conspiracy. The motive is said to have been pure vengeance. Christie\u2019s aides allegedly wanted to get payback on a mayor, Democrat Mark Sokolich, who refused to endorse his re-election as governor, then deployed official resources to cover their tracks.</p> <p>The defendants on trial are Bridget Anne Kelly, Christie\u2019s deputy chief of staff, and Bill Baroni, Christie\u2019s top appointee at the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which operates the bridge. Following a 16-month investigation, federal prosecutors have charged them with nine counts, including conspiracy to commit fraud and with violating the civil rights of the people trying to cross the bridge.</p> <p>A third defendant, former Port Authority of New York and New Jersey executive David Wildstein, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/may/01/chris-christie-david-wildstein-bridgegate\">pleaded guilty and is assisting prosecutors</a>. He will be sentenced later this year.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e4c5c159a1e4bd346a390e3ff751884c8ca43250\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e4c5c159a1e4bd346a390e3ff751884c8ca43250/0_0_3086_1851/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bridget Anne Kelly, Christie\u2019s deputy chief of staff, arrives at federal court for a hearing on 7 September.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bridget Anne Kelly, Christie\u2019s deputy chief of staff, arrives at federal court for a hearing on 7 September.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mel Evans/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On Wednesday, an appeals court ruled that a list of uncharged co-conspirators who joined the plot will remain sealed until the trial, reversing a judge\u2019s order to make the names public immediately. \u201cThe time may come, perhaps at trial, when the information in the conspirator letter ought to be made public, but that time is not here yet,\u201d the panel for the US appeals court in Philadelphia said.</p> <p>Christie, who has not been charged and has denied any knowledge of the alleged plot, has said it is highly doubtful he is on the list. A taxpayer-funded investigation by a law firm hired by Christie cleared him of misconduct, but that finding was condemned by Democrats as a whitewash. </p> <p>Opening statements in the trial of Kelly and Baroni are scheduled for 19 September. Damage to Christie will, by implication, be damaging for Trump, but perhaps less so than in a traditional campaign. <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/27/us/politics/bill-stepien-trump-campaign.html\">Last month Trump also hired Bill Stepien</a>, a former senior aide to Christie whose role in the Bridgegate scandal led to his dismissal.</p> <p>Tyler said: \u201cCorruption is bipartisan, but in this case it\u2019s a Republican with ties to the nominee. The Clinton campaign could decide to paint a picture that this is Republican behaviour. Politics is perception and perception is what people believe.</p> <p>\u201cBut in everything we\u2019re looking at with Trump and Clinton, this is another story in all the scandals between them. This would be a huge story in another year but it will get lost as just another thing. Voters are inoculated now. They will hold their noses and vote.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.ajjan.com/\">George Ajjan</a>, a Republican consultant, said: \u201cWhile Christie\u2019s woes are of course not central to Trump\u2019s candidacy, they provide good media fodder and thus bring to mind one of President Reagan\u2019s maxims: \u2018If you\u2019re explaining, you\u2019re losing.\u2019 Unfortunately for Trump, this has been a recurring theme on the less-than-tight ship that he\u2019s been running.\u201d</p> <p>Christie himself has expressed hopes for a quick trial. According to the New York Times, he told reporters last month: \u201cI know you guys all hope for this story to go on forever. But unfortunately for you, I suspect by the time we get to October or so, it will finally be over.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Good social work and child protection services were once seen as requiring stable, consistent and competent workforce, with a supportive, experienced management to build confidence and act as champions for children.</p> <p>This all seems a little too boring for the government, whose mantra is \u201cinnovation and creativity\u201d. Although money is still available from the Department for Education\u2019s innovation fund (despite draconian cuts), it is only allowed to be used for innovative and creative developments \u2013 not to fill gaps left by cuts. </p> <p>Furthermore, these developments are more likely to be approved for funding if they involve partnership with other providers, who may see this as a way into the social work and child protection marketplace <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/social-care-network/2015/oct/26/cameron-child-protection-sights-social-workers-worried\">David Cameron\u2019s government said it wanted to create</a>.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/social-care-network/2015/oct/26/cameron-child-protection-sights-social-workers-worried\">Cameron has child protection in his sights. Social workers should be worried</a> </p> </aside>  <p> </p> <p>The innovation fund has been overseen <a href=\"http://springconsortium.com/about-the-programme/\">by a board of three people</a> with a background in financial services, hedge funds and investment banking plus the chief social worker for children, Isabelle Trowler. </p> <h2>Handing the reins to the Department for Education</h2> <p>This is the context in which the new <a href=\"http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/bills/lbill/2016-2017/0057/17057.pdf\">children and social work bill</a> (pdf) needs to be read. A major part of the bill will put both child and adult social work under the control of the education secretary. </p> <p>This will give control of social work and social workers to politicians who have been determined to roll back the welfare state, cut public spending to the levels of the 1930s great depression and punish children, families, disabled adults and older people for being poor. None of these policies and intentions have as yet been revised or reversed by the new prime minister, Theresa May.</p> <p> </p> <p></p> <p>The track record of three previous education secretaries \u2013 Ed Balls, Michael Gove and Nicky Morgan \u2013 does not inspire great confidence that they would be advocates for social work and social workers.</p> <p>It is intended that the Department for Education (DfE) will have control over who can be a social worker, whether they can continue to work, how they are educated and trained and who will provide this education (the current preference is that this will be provided outside of universities by Frontline).<br></p> <p></p> <p>The other big change potentially heralded by the new bill is that the education secretary will be able to override and abandon statute which empowers lawmakers, lawyers and judges to help families and protect and care for children. It means that a single politician can, without parliamentary debate or consideration, reset the legal framework for social work and for children and families \u2013 the argument being that this will encourage creativity and innovation by local authorities and others. </p> <p>This will create a system of inconsistencies between areas in terms of statutory powers and rights for children and families. Courts in one area could be working to different legal requirements to those across a local authority boundary. </p> <p>Instead of being exciting and innovative, this system might be less generously described as an increasingly threadbare safety net, with great holes opening up as a result of cuts and idiosyncratic decisions taken by a single politician.</p> <p>The examples which have been given by government ministers and Trowler are that some areas would be able to <a href=\"http://www.communitycare.co.uk/2016/06/02/qa-isabelle-trowler-practice-systems-professionalism-private-influence-social-work/\">stop providing independent reviewing officer services</a> overseeing the planning for children in care. Others <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/jun/28/restructure-childrens-services-disaster-cornwall\">could abandon adoption panels</a> scrutinising who might adopt and for which children.</p> <h2>Cuts drive could result in protection framework being thrown out</h2> <p>These examples are about cutting services and responsibilities, not innovation. . They remove measures created within previous legislation (such as the 1989 Children Act) as important parts of a carefully crafted framework to promote the welfare and protection of children and families. This patchwork quilt of legislation could end up being alarmingly patchy.</p> <p>In recent years the Society of Local Authority Chief Executives also canvassed that statutory requirements (enshrined in the 2004 Children Act following the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2005/aug/05/climbie\">death of Victoria Climbi\u00e9</a> and the Laming inquiry) for children\u2019s service directors and lead councillors to be champions for children <a href=\"http://www.solace.org.uk/knowledge/reports_guides/Reclaiming-childrens-services-may14.pdf\">should be dropped</a> (pdf).</p> <p>If I was a director of children\u2019s services, I would be wondering about how much longer my role might last in this sea of cuts. Any tenuous feeling of security wouldn\u2019t have been helped by Michael Wilshaw, the head of Ofsted\u2019s statement that children\u2019s services directors are <a href=\"http://www.cypnow.co.uk/cyp/news/1158321/ofsted-chief-questions-focus-of-directors-of-children-s-services\">spending too much time at conferences</a> and away from their real work, or Trowler\u2019s argument that the professional leadership of children\u2019s social work services <a href=\"http://www.communitycare.co.uk/2015/07/29/mention-principal-social-workers-pcf-new-practice-leader-supervisor-knowledge-statements/\">should be held by assistant directors</a>. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/jul/20/ray-jones-social-work-threat-childrens-services-privatisation\">Ray Jones: \u2018Social work is under real threat\u2019 | Patrick Butler</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This also paves the way to cut out principal social workers, even though this role is only three years old. This would risk further undermining the sensible developments shaped by the Social Work Task Force \u2013 the role was one of its key recommendations after the death of Baby P.</p> <p>The education (and children\u2019s) select committee recently <a href=\"http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201617/cmselect/cmeduc/201/20103.htm\">expressed its concerns about the untested changes</a> being promoted by the DfE and about the unwinding and undermining of what had been built based on experience and considered reflection. </p> <p>Abundant examples can be found of local authorities being innovative within current legislation: in their introduction of administrative personal assistants alongside social workers, their integration of drug and alcohol, mental health and domestic violence adult service workers into children and families teams, or the new inter-agency teams to tackle child sexual exploitation. This belies the claim that \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/social-care-network/2016/jul/18/children-and-social-work-bill-workforce-services\">social work as a profession is all too often seen as suspicious of, and hostile to, innovation and change</a>\u201d.</p> <p>While there is certainly scope for decluttering and reducing bureaucratisation in children\u2019s social services, this should be undertaken transparently, rather than as a free-for-all determined by one government minister. However, despite the rhetoric of reducing the demands and requirements of legislation and government, the DfE recently announced it is increasing the amount of data that councils must collect and report on <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/545153/Early-Years-Census-guide-2017-v1_0.pdf\">early years</a> (pdf) and <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/537201/CIN_census_specification__2016_2017_v_1_3.pdf\">children in need services</a> (pdf). </p> <p>So beware those who say that giving exceptional powers over the social work profession to one politician is about generating creativity and innovation. Instead, recognise that the rewriting of legislation and resetting of rights and responsibilities without public debate or parliamentary scrutiny would be undertaken in the context of austerity and cuts and within what at this time \u2013 as yet not reversed by the new prime minister \u2013 is a continuing agenda of generating a marketplace for social work and child protection.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/social-care/\">Join the Social Care Network</a> to read more pieces like this.

His job involves finding out what injuries the victim claims to have and whether they were caused by the crash. He has no criminal law experience.</p> <p>But because the Caddo Parish public defender\u2019s office was suffering from a historic, statewide lack of funding, it could no longer provide counsel to hundreds of its poor clients. To fill the void, judges were randomly assigning the neglected cases to all the lawyers in Shreveport, including those specializing in real estate, personal injury, taxes and adoption. Anyone with a law license, a professional address in the parish and a pulse was placed alphabetically on a list. They could be called on at any moment to take a criminal case, unpaid.</p> <p>For Goodwin, this presented a moral dilemma. When he met Norman, he knew he wasn\u2019t fit to represent him, but a court of law was telling him that he was. \u201cI took generic criminal law and criminal procedure in law school, but that\u2019s just two classes separating me from any person,\u201d he says. </p> <p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t want me representing me.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video element--showcase\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/sep/08/louisiana-caddo-parish-non-criminal-attorneys-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/5xdhc\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2686836\"            data-video-name=\"Louisiana's public defender system: 'If you're alive and have a law license, you're eligible' \u2013\u00a0video\"            data-video-provider=\"the guardian\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57c05ad8e4b09fcabd06c939\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/08/26/20160826MARSHALL2_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/08/26/20160826MARSHALL2.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/08/26/20160826MARSHALL2_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/sep/08/louisiana-caddo-parish-non-criminal-attorneys-video\">Louisiana\u2019s public defender system: \u2018If you\u2019re alive and have a law license, you\u2019re eligible\u2019</a></figcaption> </figure>   <ul> <li><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/sep/08/louisiana-caddo-parish-non-criminal-attorneys-video\">Louisiana\u2019s public defender system: \u2018If you\u2019re alive and have a law license, you\u2019re eligible\u2019</a>.

In Lafayette, another populous parish 215 miles south-east of Caddo, the defender had to cut 47 of 65 attorneys. The waitlist there has more than 4,500 defendants, many facing life in prison. </p> <p>The issue now facing judges and courts across the state is how to ensure a functional \u2013 and constitutional \u2013 justice system in the wake of these shortages. In New Orleans, for example, Judge Arthur Hunter <a href=\"http://www.nola.com/crime/index.ssf/2016/04/orleans_judge_halts_prosecutio.html\">ruled</a> on 8 April that poor defendants sitting on a waitlist must be released from jail until the public defender can represent them. Prosecutors are appealing several of those defendants\u2019 cases . </p> <p>Everywhere else in the state, however, judges have taken more conservative approaches. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>Their \u2018solution\u2019 is to put up cardboard cut-outs of defense lawyers in place of spending money on real public defenders</p> <footer> <cite>Stephen Singer, Loyola University</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to be the one that lets one of them out, unless a higher court tells me I must,\u201d says Jacque Derr, the district judge of Winn Parish, a rural area in central Louisiana. \u201cWhat I\u2019m scared of is some serious offender who is guilty ending up walking down our streets because of this \u2026 All I can do is find a lawyer to agree to do it, or else these suckers are fixing to be home free.\u201d</p> <p>This summer, that is exactly what many of Louisiana\u2019s judges have done. Judge Derr has conscripted his city prosecutor to also help out as a public defender. And instead of releasing inmates, the judges in Caddo Parish and elsewhere have appointed non-criminal attorneys like Goodwin to take criminal cases that they may not be equipped for.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a way of trying to paper over a funding problem without funding \u2013 to make sure that no matter what, they can keep their prosecutions going,\u201d says Stephen Singer, a law professor at Loyola University and formerly the chief of trials and general counsel of the New Orleans public defender\u2019s office. \u201cTheir \u2018solution\u2019 is to put up cardboard cut-outs of defense lawyers in place of actually spending the money on real public defenders.\u201d</p> <h2>\u2018Like asking a dentist to do heart surgery\u2019</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/08/la-public-defenders/\" data-alt=\"caddo parish graphic\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/08/la-public-defenders/\">caddo parish graphic</a> </figure>  <p>Shreveport, the seat of Caddo Parish, was the last capital of the Confederacy. Directly in front of its courthouse, a monument to the cause reads: \u201cLest We Forget.\u201d </p> <p>The city was also home to a branch of the Standard Oil company, but Louisiana\u2019s oil and gas industry has struggled in recent years, leading to an economic downturn that affected funding for public services such as indigent defense. Today, casinos and strip clubs light up its mid-rise skyline, and billboards for lawyers (\u201cOne Call, Y\u2019all!\u201d) line the highways.</p> <p>On a humid day in June, many of those lawyers are gathered for a luncheon thrown by the Shreveport Bar Association. Dressed in seersucker suits and bow ties, they are crowded around the buffet, spooning fried catfish and black-eyed peas on to their plates. Between bites, everyone is commiserating about the public defender\u2019s funding crisis, and how ill-equipped they are to fill in. \u201cI just got another one this week!\u201d says Richard Lamb, a tax attorney who admits he has never argued a case in court.</p> <p>The analogies seem to come easy: </p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s like asking a dentist to do heart surgery,\u201d Lamb says. </p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s like if we told a prosecutor to do a medical malpractice suit,\u201d says Goodwin, the insurance attorney. </p> <p>\u201cWhat if private lawyers were appointed to be DAs?\u201d says Steve Baker, an adoption attorney, later in the day. \u201cWe\u2019d probably just dismiss a lot of the cases, and they don\u2019t want that.\u201d</p> <p>Another civil attorney, Jim McMichael, chimes in with a funny story about how a defendant put an arm around his appointed lawyer\u2019s shoulder and said: \u201cWould it help if I told the judge that I also thought you were incompetent?\u201d</p> <p>Goodwin \u2013 whose former client Norman Williams Jr made a deal with the district attorney to testify against another defendant and is now doing five years in prison \u2013 says he cannot tell if this is all a comedy or a tragedy. \u201cWe\u2019re sharing laughs over beers about how my friend was assigned to represent a pimp,\u201d he says. \u201cBut then again, someone\u2019s liberty is at stake here.\u201d</p> <p>On at least three occasions in the past, Caddo Parish has taken the same draft-a-lawyer route out of a public defender crisis \u2013 and criminal defendants have fared far worse than Williams. In 1984, the local bar had divided all of Shreveport\u2019s lawyers alphabetically, just as judges did again this year, to represent the indigent. In one murder case, a man named Glenn Ford was randomly assigned to be defended by an oil and gas attorney and a slip-and-fall insurance attorney. They failed to challenge prosecutors\u2019 selection of an all-white jury, which then found Ford guilty after deliberating for only three hours. He spent the last three decades of his life on death row before being exonerated in March 2014.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"57e91d8314e7682513122a2d90c0ffe99bf80028\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/57e91d8314e7682513122a2d90c0ffe99bf80028/137_0_1857_1114/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Steve Baker, adoption attorney in Shreveport\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Steve Baker, who practices adoption law in Shreveport, said of the crisis: \u2018What if private lawyers were appointed to be DAs?

The state of Louisiana never provided compensation to him or his family.</p> <p>This time around, to better prepare their lawyers for these assigned cases, the local bar association planned a seminar on criminal law for non-criminal attorneys. (One flyer read: \u201cThis Will Sell Out, So Make Your Reservation Now!\u201d)</p> <p>On a Friday in May, more than 20 private attorneys filed into the basement of the Caddo Parish courthouse, where they learned the \u201cDo\u2019s and Don\u2019t\u2019s of Providing Effective Assistance\u201d in criminal cases. Over a three-hour period, a judge, a representative from the DA\u2019s office, a former DA and a former public defender showed them PowerPoint presentations on how to interview a client (compare what the client is saying with what you know from the police report), how to visit a jail (show your bar card) and how to file basic motions. They also provided examples of the differences between criminal and civil rules for evidence. In the final few minutes, volunteers were chosen to practice their newfound skills in several courtroom scenarios, including a mock arraignment and bail hearing.</p> <p>\u201cWe ran out of time before all the questions could get answered,\u201d says Jim McMichael, the bar association attorney who helped organize the seminar. \u201cPeople were so concerned, saying: \u2018I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Some in attendance were unimpressed with the crash course. \u201cIn three hours, they\u2019re supposed to become criminal defenders?\u201d says Henry Walker, a longtime criminal defense attorney in Shreveport and the former president of the Louisiana criminal defense bar. \u201cThey just learned how to trust the DA, make quick deals, dispose of the case and go back to their real jobs.\u201d</p> <p>But Judge Brady O\u2019Callaghan, who helped implement Caddo Parish\u2019s system of appointing private lawyers, believes many of them are more capable than they have given themselves credit for. \u201cIf someone can depose a doctor for five hours, they can do a plea hearing,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve never known a lawyer to tell a paying client: \u2018I can\u2019t learn this, I\u2019m sorry.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>In O\u2019Callaghan\u2019s view, all these lawyers have a professional obligation to offer their assistance, when needed, to the poor. \u201cThis is not something we\u2019re ecstatic about,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s not like we\u2019re just picking out of a hat and saying: \u2018Hey, let\u2019s see what happens\u2019 \u2026 But as a temporary solution, it is better than either releasing these defendants from jail or incarcerating them without any lawyer.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>This is not something we\u2019re ecstatic about.

The court also does not pay them to take the cases and rarely offers funds for hiring investigators or expert witnesses. They have little incentive, in other words, to investigate crime scenes, call witnesses, meet clients and their families, and study up on the developments in criminal law in the years since they left law school.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to prioritize our paying cases, there\u2019s no denying it,\u201d says David Turansky, a former divorce lawyer who now focuses on personal injury cases. \u201cWe\u2019re just not going to spend our time learning constitutional law or what a \u2018Batson challenge\u2019 is.\u201d</p> <p>Steve Baker, a chatty adoption attorney with a thick book of New Yorker lawyer cartoons in his office, says that it would be unethical for him to take the cases. His strategy has been to object to the appointments outright, and to share useful legal motions and pleadings with his colleagues so they can get out of them, too.</p> <p>In one case, Baker was appointed to represent a defendant who faced life in prison \u2013 but he took no action and never visited the person in jail (the case was reassigned to another lawyer more than seven months later). In another, a partner at his firm instructed his son, a junior associate, to walk down to the courthouse and take a plea as quickly as possible.</p> <p>\u201cMost of us are just trying to get in, get out,\u201d he says.</p> <p>On 1 July, Louisiana\u2019s new fiscal year began, and public defense offices in several parishes received a small influx of funds. National attention on the crisis waned, and in Caddo Parish and elsewhere the public defenders have temporarily reduced their waitlists and stopped actively appointing non-criminal attorneys.</p> <p>But because the fundamentals of how the state funds public defense \u2013 primarily through traffic tickets \u2013 have not changed, the defenders say their money will inevitably run dry in the course of only a few months. In Caddo, any private attorneys who have already been assigned cases still have to see them through, and the appointments may resume later in the year.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re trying not to have to do this,\u201d says Pam Smart, the district\u2019s chief public defender, referring to the appointment of non-criminal attorneys. \u201cBut we\u2019re going to always be teetering on the edge of it.\u201d</p> <h2>Prosecutors play defense</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/08/la-winn-public-defenders/\" data-alt=\"winn parish graphic\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/08/la-winn-public-defenders/\">winn parish graphic</a> </figure>  <p>A few hours to the south-east, in an office decorated with a wall-sized map of the state of Louisiana, a lawyer named J Keith Gates sits behind two heaps of files: one for his job as a prosecutor, the other for his job as a public defender.</p> <p>\u201cLook, it\u2019s all courtroom work,\u201d he says, pulling a file from each stack to show their similarities. \u201cThere\u2019s no conflict unless you\u2019re prosecuting and defending at the same time.\u201d</p> <p>It is a situation practically unheard of elsewhere in the US \u2013 a half-prosecutor, half-defender \u2013 but in Winn Parish, where the funding crisis left the public defender\u2019s office even more decimated than in Caddo, it was perhaps the only option.</p> <p>Last year, the Winn public defender saw its staff of three attorneys, two investigators, and two secretaries slashed to one part-time lawyer \u2013 a former Louisiana State University football player named Herman Castete \u2013 one part-time investigator and a part-time assistant.</p> <p>Castete implemented a waitlist, and poor defendants in conflict cases were sitting in jail without an attorney. \u201cIt may be impossible for the public defender\u2019s office to remain open,\u201d he wrote in an <a href=\"https://www.themarshallproject.org/documents/3001010-8th-District-Restriction-of-Services-Plan#.2gWztCIw4\">internal report</a> to the state public defender board. \u201cThere is simply no money available.\u201d</p> <p>To temporarily resolve that situation, the district judge, Jacque Derr, began appointing attorneys from the private bar, just like in Caddo Parish. But Winn is much more rural, with fewer available lawyers, so Derr had to take the additional measure of enlisting Gates. </p> <p>It is against Louisiana Public Defender Board policy for anyone serving with any public defender\u2019s office to also serve as a prosecutor within the same district. But in this case, the defender himself, Castete, had <a href=\"https://www.themarshallproject.org/documents/3001012-8th-District-Prosecutor-Exemption-Request#.fCNf7i9TK\">signed on to</a> the idea. </p> <p>Gates says that he, Derr, Castete and the DA are all very diligent about avoiding potential conflicts of interest. As city prosecutor, he mostly handles minor cases brought to him by the city police (battery, disturbing the peace, DUI, shoplifting, theft), while in his new role as a district defender he is handling more serious felonies (armed robbery, weapons crimes, drug crimes).

He plays for the other team,\u201d Singer says. </p> <p>For example, many defendants charged with felonies in district court, where Gates would be their defender, have also been charged with misdemeanors in city court, where he is the prosecutor. In short, Gates could have defendants whom he has both prosecuted and defended. </p> <p>Derr, whose chambers are decorated with a sign reading \u201cBe Still And Know That I Am Boss\u201d, agrees there is a conflict \u2013 but adds: \u201cNobody\u2019s ever said, \u2018Hey, judge, he prosecuted me, I don\u2019t want him defending me.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Besides, says Derr, there are more pressing issues for Winn Parish to resolve than Gates\u2019s dual role \u2013 like whether the public defense crisis will slow down the very important prosecution of Kenneth Bratton, a defendant whom the judge calls \u201ca one-man serial crime wave\u201d. Bratton has most recently been accused of at least three counts of burglary, three counts of trespassing and damage to property, and stealing gasoline. He also led the sheriff\u2019s office on a nine-day manhunt.</p> <p>\u201cAin\u2019t no question that dude did it,\u201d says Derr, who will be presiding over Bratton\u2019s case.</p> <p>The only problem is that Bratton has been sitting in jail for over a year without an attorney, trying to write his own legal motions, because the defender\u2019s office is so undermanned. In order to make sure that he has no constitutional claim to be released, the judge first tried to appoint two civil rights attorneys from New Orleans \u2013 without notifying them. They found out and objected.</p> <p>Anna Lellelid, one of the attorneys conscripted from afar, says that being 250 miles away from her client would make her just as ineffective as a non-criminal lawyer. \u201cHe\u2019s just shuffling attorneys around,\u201d she says of Derr, \u201ctrying to do whatever he can to moot the underlying issue, which is the funding of the public defender\u2019s office.\u201d</p> <p>But now the judge is excited about his new strategy: he will have the prosecutor, Gates, represent Bratton.</p> <p>\u201cKenny\u2019s got a lawyer,\u201d Derr says. \u201cSo now we can convict him.\u201d</p> <ul> <li><em>Tomorrow, meet Rhonda Covington, the last line of defense for thousands in a forgotten corner of rural Louisiana</em></li> </ul>",
  "<p>Even a stopped clock is right twice daily. So we shouldn\u2019t be too surprised that Donald Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, whose economic policies can broadly be described as a big goofy mess, has managed to hit the nail on the head with at least one critique. And it happens to be an important one for the wallets of most Americans.</p> <p> On Labor Day, Trump said that the Federal Reserve\u2019s ultra-low interest rates have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/06/trump-us-federal-reserve-false-economy-interest-rates\">created a \u201cfalse economy\u201d</a> and that \u201cat some point the rates are going to have to change.\u201d </p> <p> That\u2019s hardly earth-shattering news. Janet Yellen, the chair of the Federal Reserve\u2019s team of policymakers, and her colleagues agreed to raise rates for the first time in nearly a decade since December. But they also passed up a handful of opportunities to hike rates further, while events beyond their control (China\u2019s economic struggles, unexpectedly anemic US economic data, the Brexit shock) forced them to the sidelines on other occasions.</p> <p> When interest rates are that low, there\u2019s nowhere else for investors to park their cash except the stock market. And there\u2019s no other reason to invest in stocks except the fact that there\u2019s no other place to put it that might earn a reasonable return.</p> <p> Translation? At this stage, the geriatric bull market is hooked on cheap money from the Fed, not fundamentals. Which means all those records you keep reading about the S&amp;P 500 index and other market bellwethers setting <a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2016/08/08/investing/stock-market-sp500-high/\">simply aren\u2019t justified</a>. That, in turn, means that Trump has correctly pointed out that the Fed\u2019s policy of flooding the market with cheap money, via ultra-low interest rates, is creating a speculative stock market bubble. You remember how the last one of those \u2013 in housing \u2013 ended, don\u2019t you? Yes, exactly.</p> <p> The Fed\u2019s policymakers seem to be terrified of what will happen when they begin normalizing interest rates. Perhaps they\u2019re right to worry, because almost certainly we\u2019ll witness a big hit to our stock and bond portfolios simultaneously. </p> <p>Bond prices will fall because that\u2019s what happens whenever interest rates rise \u2013 they move inversely, because the value of the fixed interest payments on those existing bonds declines as new bonds are issued at a higher price. Stocks will lose value because by this point in the geriatric bull market, the chief element supporting them is the fact that rates are low \u2013 the argument in their favor is a relative one rather than an absolute one, that stocks are alluring in their own right.</p> <p>Pundits of all kinds have been making that argument for months now, pointing out that stocks are expensive. David Kostin, chief US equity strategist at Goldman Sachs, <a href=\"http://finance.yahoo.com/news/goldman-no-medal-winners-stock-183812662.html\">downgraded stocks of all kinds to \u201cunderweight\u201d in early August</a> and noted that the median valuation for an S&amp;P 500 stock was in the 98th percentile. Kostin anticipated a 5% drop in the months following his note to clients, but in its immediate aftermath, the S&amp;P index only went on to post new highs. </p> <p>Investors who are looking at their statements and celebrating really should send the Fed flowers and chocolates in gratitude. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"154a098c7405de1e10245b6163367cc6761050a3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/154a098c7405de1e10245b6163367cc6761050a3/0_130_4704_2822/1000.jpg\" alt=\"When interest rates are that low, there\u2019s nowhere else for investors to park their cash except the stock market.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">When interest rates are that low, there\u2019s nowhere else for investors to park their cash except the stock market.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Drew/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But these gains aren\u2019t happening because of a robust improvement in corporate fundamentals across the board. In the second quarter, according to data from Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S, S&amp;P 500 corporate profits actually declined 2.2.%. Stripping out money-losing energy companies improved the picture somewhat and resulted in a second-quarter increase in profitability of 2.2%. But the reality is that we\u2019re in the midst of a prolonged period in which profits are barely growing, and corporate revenues are shrinking \u2013 and yet in which stock prices are roaring higher. That\u2019s counterintuitive. </p> <p>In fact, one analyst has calculated that low interest rates <a href=\"http://finance.yahoo.com/news/the-fed-caused-93--of-the-entire-stock-market-s-move-since-2008--analysis-194426366.html\">can explain 93% of the first eight years of the stock market\u2019s bull run</a>, from March 2008 until March 2016. </p> <p>So, Trump is right: the Fed has spawned a bull market, and quite possibly one that has spun out of control. </p> <p>During the Republican primary season, some other isolated bits of Fed-related common sense surfaced from Trump, including noting that low rates aren\u2019t always such a bad thing, especially if you happen to be running a business or otherwise in need of debt financing.</p> <p>\u201cThe best thing we have going right now is that interest rates are so low that lots of good things can be done that aren\u2019t being done, amazingly,\u201d <a href=\"http://theweek.com/articles/620637/donald-trump-shockingly-sane-federal-reserve\">he said</a>. Toss out the mangled syntax, and what Trump is suggesting is that we squandered the opportunity to borrow at a low cost and reinvest in innovation and infrastructure. </p> <p>In Trump\u2019s worldview, of course, the Fed\u2019s reason for keeping rates so low for so long was political. Yellen and her predecessors were trying to make Barack Obama and his economic policies look good. </p> <p>They did so by getting us all hooked on monetary crack: cheap money, via low interest rates. Debt became inexpensive (if we could get it from the banks) and stocks (for those of us with the cash to invest) were guaranteed to go higher because, let\u2019s face it, what else was everyone else going to invest in? It was a great way to transform a speculative market \u2013 stocks \u2013 into what was very nearly a sure thing. </p> <p>In fact, if the Fed is in anyone\u2019s pocket, it\u2019s likely to be that of the treasurers of Fortune 500 corporations. The minute that policymakers raise interest rates, <em>swoosh,</em> in will come a lot of capital from overseas, in search of the higher yields they could get on short-term US Treasuries. Zoom \u2013 up would go the US dollar in response. And that crashing sound? Well, that would be the reverberations from the plunge in corporate profits. </p> <p>As I\u2019ve already pointed out, revenues and profits are already under pressure, and nearly half (about 48%, to be precise) of revenues at S&amp;P 500 companies come from overseas. If the dollar goes up in value, every pound, euro, yen, etc that they earn overseas <a href=\"https://www.stlouisfed.org/on-the-economy/2016/february/rate-hikes-affect-dollars-exchange-rate\">will be worth fewer dollars</a>. The Fed has a mandate to keep unemployment levels stable, and you can be reasonably sure that they\u2019re aware that a sudden plunge in earnings would lead to layoffs. They don\u2019t need Obama to whisper into their ears.</p> <p>Hillary Clinton chose to seize the moment that Trump finally said something sane and sensible to scold him, warning him not to comment about what the Fed does \u201cwhen you are either running for president or you are president\u201d. She went on to warn: \u201cWords have consequences. Words move markets. Words can be misinterpreted.\u201d</p> <p>Not Trump\u2019s, clearly. The market has plodded along ever since he made his remarks, apparently oblivious to his views of the Fed and the market. Trump isn\u2019t Warren Buffett, BlackRock\u2019s Larry Fink or David Kostin of Goldman Sachs. </p> <p>It\u2019s a pity, because this time he\u2019s right. It may not happen very often \u2013 we may not see it again on an issue of real substance during this campaign. But this is a stock market bubble that has been inflated by the Fed\u2019s easy market policy. You don\u2019t have to believe that the Fed is politicized to agree on that diagnosis. You should accept that this is what we\u2019re confronting, however \u2013 and prepare for the fallout whenever it ends.</p>",

We are outsiders looking in, forever struggling for equality and understanding.</p> <p>Black parents know the feeling. They\u2019ve long told their children that they\u2019re different and will experience inequities and discrimination in almost every corner of American life. \u201cThe talk\u201d can mean the difference between freedom and incarceration, life and death. </p> <p>We now have our own talk with our kids.</p> <p>It begins with profiling. <a href=\"https://thinkprogress.org/new-racial-profiling-guidance-retains-broad-exemptions-for-immigration-national-security-b233d3aeba56#.e23km2khx\">Guidelines released by the justice department in 2014</a> explicitly <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2014/12/8/7351285/racial-profiling\">permit profiling</a> at airports and borders.

It\u2019s hard to tell our children that we\u2019re equal when we can be stopped by law enforcement officials because of our turbans, hijabs or the color of our skin.</p> <p>There\u2019s also the<a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/news/lawsuit-challenges-governments-suspicious-activity-report-program\"> suspicious activity reporting program</a>, which directs local law enforcement officers to report activities they believe are indicative of terrorism or illicit activity. Muslim Americans who have <a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/legal-document/gill-v-doj-complaint\">placed large purchase orders</a> for computers at Best Buy, searched for video games online, and <a href=\"https://action.aclu.org/secure/stop-the-suspicion\">purchased bottled water from Costco</a> have found themselves ensnared by this sweeping operation.

Dearborn, Michigan, a city with a population of roughly 100,000 and known for its large Muslim and Arab American community, has <a href=\"http://www.mlive.com/news/detroit/index.ssf/2014/08/report_more_residents_in_dearb.html\">more watchlisted residents</a> than any other city in the US, except New York.</p> <p>Our adolescents and young adults are acutely vulnerable to profiling. \u201cBecoming confrontational\u201d, \u201cunexpected clashes over ideological differences\u201d or \u201ca new interest in watching or sharing violent material\u201d have been <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2014/04/16/remarks-assistant-president-homeland-security-and-counterterrorism-lisa-\">construed</a> as indicators of violent extremism and thus often precede a visit from law enforcement authorities. Other countering violent extremism programs have <a href=\"https://cve.fbi.gov/home.html\">used indicators</a> such as \u201ctalking about traveling to places that sound suspicious\u201d, \u201cusing code words or unusual language\u201d and \u201cstudying or taking pictures of potential targets\u201d.</p> <p>Muslim youth who dare to publicly challenge US foreign policy, to speak Arabic in public or to take photos of national monuments run the real risk that they\u2019ll draw the attention of police. In the case of Ahmed Mohamed, the 14-year-old Muslim American student from Irving, Texas, all it took was a passion for engineering and a homemade clock.</p> <p>If \u201cthe talk\u201d begins with profiling, it moves quickly to hate violence \u2013 now mainstream, and intensified and exacerbated by government stigmatization. Islamophobia is higher now than after 9/11 and anti-Muslim violence was <a href=\"http://bridge.georgetown.edu/when-islamophobia-turns-violent-the-2016-u-s-presidential-elections/\">significantly higher in 2015 than it was prior to 9/11</a>, with Muslim Americans about six to nine times more likely to experience violence now than before. Sikh and Arab Americans are often targeted as well; hate has a rapacious appetite. In the wake of the San Bernardino tragedy, for example, Sikh Americans reported a <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.in/uzair-hasan-rizvi/post-spike-in-hate-crimes-us-sikh-community-launches-new-tool-t/\">200% rise in hate incidents</a>.</p> <p>Hate crime reporting by police, though, is <a href=\"http://bigstory.ap.org/article/8247a1d2f76b4baea2a121186dedf768/ap-patchy-reporting-undercuts-national-hate-crimes-count\">voluntary, not mandatory</a>, leaving us unable to even understand the scope of what we endure. The Associated Press recently <a href=\"http://bigstory.ap.org/article/8247a1d2f76b4baea2a121186dedf768/ap-patchy-reporting-undercuts-national-hate-crimes-count\">found</a> that roughly 17% of all city and county law enforcement agencies nationwide haven\u2019t submitted a single hate crime report in the last six years. Although discrimination and bigotry will never be eradicated, better data would foster awareness and ensure that community leaders and law enforcement have additional resources to combat hate violence at the local level.</p> <p>If we don\u2019t speak to our children, the roles often reverse, and they come to us. <a href=\"http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2014/3/13/a-go-home-terroristasikhchildrenbulliedtwicenationalaverage.html\">Sikh</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cair.com/press-center/press-releases/13215-cair-ca-report-more-than-half-of-california-muslim-students-targeted-by-faith-based-bullying.html\">Muslim American children</a> are bullied at twice the national average.

Bullying correlates with sub-par academic performance, low self-esteem, depression and poor health.

He made headlines nationally this week by standing at the school gates and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/sep/06/police-called-school-pupils-sent-home-wrong-uniform-hartsdown-academy-margate\">turning away students</a> whose uniform wasn\u2019t up to standard: 50 of them on the first day of term, 20 the day after. Angry parents called <a href=\"http://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/hartsdown-academy-head-says-compared-8783314\">him a Nazi</a>, and complained of Gestapo tactics, which goes to show that we really should place more emphasis on history in the national curriculum. Hitler murdered millions of people, simply because they were Jewish, or otherwise failed to comply with his exacting standards; Tate was trying to stamp his authority by sending home kids who were wearing trainers. Can you spot the difference there?</p> <p>It is true that it might have been a little harsh to send students home on their first day. Perhaps a warning letter would have been more diplomatic, giving harassed and cash-strapped parents a few days to go to the shops and get their kids kitted out correctly. The start of term can be a financial nightmare, and it has been <a href=\"http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/parents-targeted-back-school-loans-8762566\">reported</a> that a company in the Midlands is offering \u00a3300 loans to help with back-to-school expenses \u2013 at an eye-watering interest rate equivalent to 200% a year. But it is also true is that nearly 900 students in an economically disadvantaged part of Kent did manage to turn up in the required outfit: in an interview, the beleaguered head claimed that in previous years, some students had been bullied for turning up in full uniform.</p> <p>All of which might imply that I\u2019m all for school uniforms. I am not. I hated mine. My teenage skin reacted badly to nylon \u2013 still does, probably, though I haven\u2019t tested that for decades \u2013 and the hideous synthetic blouses my school imposed on me left me with two, equally devastating choices: festering acne on my back, or my mum\u2019s triumphant solution, a thick cotton BHS vest.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Uniform can also help with discipline, it gives the school an identity and hopefully pride</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The argument is that uniform levels the playing field, making all students look the same. This is nonsense. The well-off kids are the ones with the fashionably-cut skirts and trousers and expensive shoes, while the poorer kids are marked out by their scuffed Primark footwear or the worn, ankle-swinging trousers they outgrew months before. And no matter how minutely the school tries to stamp it out, individuality always finds an expression. There are many ways to knot a tie, to adjust a skirt, or casually sling a sweater round your shoulders, and these tiny signifiers speak volumes in the closed, claustrophobic world of school.</p> <p>But nonetheless, research has shown that uniform can be effective. It takes away the pressure of deciding what to wear in the morning, and removes at least some of the peer pressure to wear expensive brands. Banning short skirts, high heels and tight trousers gives our children some respite from being oversexualised, and obsessively body conscious.</p> <p>Uniform can also help with discipline, it gives the school an identity and hopefully pride, and it helps to identify intruders more easily, as well as truants: the head at my son\u2019s old school in Hackney managed to boost attendance considerably, just by riding around the area on his bike at 9am, rounding up uniformed students wandering off in the wrong direction.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/teacher-network/2016/sep/08/debate-should-schools-send-pupils-home-for-wearing-the-wrong-uniform\">Debate: should schools send pupils home for wearing the wrong uniform?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Detractors often point out that Scandinavian schools are consistently ranked amongst the best in the world, and that uniforms are never required there. But there are plenty of other things they don\u2019t have, either. Constant testing of children. League tables. Crumbling school buildings. Instead, Denmark, Norway, Finland and Sweden spend more on education as a proportion of GDP than almost any other country. In the UK, education has long been used as a political football, the constant fiddling leaving teachers running to keep up with forever-moving goalposts. Theresa May, with her <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/sep/06/grammar-schools-government-will-publish-plan-end-ban-weeks\">plans</a> to reintroduce grammar schools (which Scandinavians also somehow do without), is just one of a long, long line.</p> <p>Hartsdown Academy is rated by Ofsted as a good school. As he starts his new job, I\u2019d imagine Matthew Tate, like most headteachers, is striving against the odds to attain that coveted excellent grade. We can criticise him for clinging to his zero-tolerance uniform policy as some sort of magic bullet. But unless we\u2019re willing to fund schools properly, give teachers the resources they deserve, and prioritise ensuring every child has a truly equal chance to learn and find their talents, what else has he got?</p>",

But before it gets to that, pay careful attention to the tone and accuracy of your writing.</p> <p>Claire de Than, a senior lecturer at City University\u2019s law school and an expert in media law explains: \u201cThe chances of a blog with a small audience being sued successfully for defamation are small, and bloggers often have the defence of honest opinion, but they need to make it clear that it is an opinion. Even a typo or a misplaced quotation mark can lead to a libel allegation.\u201d</p> <h2>It\u2019s better to be right than to be first</h2> <p> It is particularly important for budding writers and journalists to take care over their online scribblings. Alex Veeneman, a managing editor of <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.kettlemag.co.uk/\">Kettlemag</a>, a site that publishes many student writers, says he would encourage any student writer to take care over getting their facts straight.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2016/aug/12/social-media-law-an-essential-guide\">Social media law: an essential guide</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cIt is better to be right than to be first when publishing anything online,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you are serious about getting into journalism, or growing the popularity of your blog, then it\u2019s all about building trust with your audience. That comes from caring about accuracy, which has the added benefit of avoiding a lawsuit. Don\u2019t approach your article with a sense of malice.\u201d</p> <h2>Don\u2019t steal photos... or ideas</h2> <p>It seems that everyone on the internet steals photos, says Felle, but he recommends making an effort not to join in. Copyright law can sneak up. <a href=\"http://petapixel.com/2013/06/29/nytimes-photographer-sues-perez-hilton-for-2-1-million-for-copyright-infringement/\">Gossip blogger Perez Hilton</a> was slapped with a $2.1m (\u00a31.6) claim in 2013 for copyright infringement after he used 14 photos taken by a New York Times photographer (and then tried to pass them off as his own).</p> <p> Assume that something is copyrighted until proven otherwise, recommends dating blogger Roni Loren, who was <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.blogher.com/bloggers-beware-you-can-get-sued-using-photos-your-blog-my-story\">sued for using a picture from Google images</a>.</p> <p>Felles adds: \u201cIt\u2019s about being professional with your work.

Or ask the photographer first \u2013 they\u2019ll appreciate it.\u201d</p> <p> Apart from anything else, copying other people, whether it\u2019s their words or photos, takes all the creativity out of blogging.

  "<p>Sam* is a paedophile. Sam\u2019s offence was a serious one \u2013 threatening a young boy and forcibly kissing and touching him. Sam was found guilty of this offence, and has a past history of offending including assaults, theft and drug use.</p> <p>Sam is not in prison. Sam is in hospital. Sam was sent to hospital because the court took the view that the degree of mental illness that Sam had, in the form of schizophrenia and post-traumatic stress disorder, was so severe that Sam would not be safe in a custodial setting.</p> <p>Sam is a teenage girl. Her history of contact with social services began before she was born. Her mother also had mental health problems, and was using heroin throughout her pregnancy. Sam never knew her mother who abandoned her soon after the birth. Instead, Sam was looked after by her father who was part of a paedophile ring. Sam suffered chronic abuse and still lives with the physical side effects.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/healthcare-network/2016/jun/02/questioned-ability-nurse-after-seeing-first-patient-die\">I questioned my ability as a nurse after seeing my first patient die</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The paedophile ring was subsequently exposed by the police, her father went to prison and Sam spent most of her childhood with a relative, who failed to protect her from a series of physically and at times sexually abusive partners. Social, health and education services all raised concerns that she was often inappropriately dressed for the weather, looked undernourished and had bruises that were hard to explain, but the family frequently relocated when people came knocking at the door. She had few friends, and when she did go to school she often sat quietly on her own in the corner so that she could see who was around her.</p> <p>She began self-harming, took an overdose and attempted suicide. She has scars that will be visible for the rest of her life. She\u2019s had psychotic episodes as a result of using a mixture of amphetamines and ketamine. She continues to experience voices that tell her that she is worthless and should try to kill herself. On her worst nights, she relives her experiences at the hands of every abuser that has ever touched her \u2013 they\u2019re holding her down, and nobody ever comes to make it stop.</p> <p>Sam\u2019s story is not the worst I\u2019ve come across. Sam is not simply defined by her behaviour. She is a frightened, fragmented and traumatised little girl who finds praise terrifying, because in the past it was so often associated with abuse of her trust. We\u2019re working with her and with the other girls on my ward, to try to begin the process of healing. She doesn\u2019t understand why we are trying, but she knows that we are, and that we will never give up on her, even when she begs us to. We are very conscious of her risks to others, but the most pressing need is to stop her from killing herself.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/healthcare-network/2016/apr/07/health-visitor-home-visit-drug-abuse-domestic-violence-terrifying\">Walking into a home with drug abuse and domestic violence was terrifying</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Sam is already surprising us with her shy sense of humour and resilience despite her background.

She didn\u2019t have the same childhood, the same opportunities or the same care. She never had anyone to tell her that things would be OK, or to rescue her when she was in pain and thought she would die. She never had anyone to help her understand that she can be whoever she wants to be, that she doesn\u2019t have to replicate the same cycle, or that relationships with other people can be safe. She never had anyone to share her hopes and dreams with. She never had anyone that she could trust.</p> <p>It is my great privilege to work alongside our clinical team in trying to help people like Sam.

  "<p>This past summer, I was guest-teaching in Europe. When the talk of the town wasn\u2019t Brexit, it was the US election. It was discussed the way you\u2019d discuss an alien invasion: bizarre. </p> <p>A look at US history, however, suggests that this election is far from unusual, and that Donald Trump\u2019s populist, anti-Washington cry to Make America Great Again emerges from the foundational belief of many early settlers: that they were the chosen ones who saw corruption and fought it, building a world cleansed of its sins.</p> <p>This ethos embodies what <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/feb/10/christianity-wrong-civil-religion-rousseau\">Jean-Jacques Rousseau</a> called \u201ccivil religion\u201d \u2013 that is, the features that undergird political, social and economic behavior.

In it, we hear echoes of the preacher\u2019s \u201crid ye of the devil\u201d and traces of the political call to \u201cthrow the bastards out\u201d.</p> <p>This election year, it\u2019s clearest in the Trump campaign but emerges in alternative form in Democratic positions. Populist demands grow loud when the \u201cbastards\u201d are identified as Washington insiders, constrainers of liberties, corrupt and incompetent. Nativist demands increase when the \u201cbastards\u201d are immigrants or other suspect groups. In both, a troubled world will be set right when evil forces are purged.</p> <p>The country was born in a revolution against central government, but long before, early settlers, fleeing the centralization of Charles I, were wary of London: the king\u2019s men were the bastards to be thrown out in order to preserve local control. \u201cThe Congregational churches and self-contained towns of Massachusetts,\u201d the historian TH Breen writes, \u201cstood as visible evidence of the founders\u2019 decision to preserve in America what had been threatened in the mother country.\u201d </p> <p>The many early settlers who were religious dissenters were doubly suspicious of government, first for its centralizing efforts and second for the persecution it had foisted upon them. Internal migration through sparsely settled land contributed to the dismissal of central government and growing self-reliance, as there was relatively little government to rely on. Individual initiative and local community were the keys to survival. </p> <p>National government took a larger role as the country grew, yet the value of individual and local effort combined with a suspicion of central authorities were rooted in America\u2019s civil faith.</p> <p>Protestantism, born also in revolution (against Rome), added to the mix. The mandate to read the Bible for oneself and find one\u2019s own path to God encouraged the view that the responsible moral agent is the individual (with guidance from her local church). The Great Awakenings of the 1730s-1740s and 1820s-50s were festivals of individual iconoclasm, religious groups splintering off from established institutions, and populist religious ideas.</p> <p>Reformed Protestantism, which came to America through Puritan and other Calvinist traditions, had an even stronger impact on political development. It held that the sovereign nation does not start with central government but with the local covenanted community \u2013 the foedus \u2013 which form networks to constitute the nation. It\u2019s these ideas that gave the US its federal system of government and the continuing political and legal battles about states\u2019 rights. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ea2a3a3074dac52ce16a7a60491cda9ebe457494\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ea2a3a3074dac52ce16a7a60491cda9ebe457494/0_0_3500_2402/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ammon Bundy greets occupier Duane Ehmer and his horse at the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge.

Among the more anti-authoritarian sects was Arminianism \u2013 or in America, Methodism \u2013 in which the accent shifted subtly to the individual\u2019s role in salvation. It was a faith well-suited to a self-reliant nation wary of authorities, and America embraced it. The number of Methodist churches rose from 20 in 1770 to 19,883 in 1860. By the mid-19th century, two Kentucky preachers could in good anti-authoritarian conscience opine: \u201cWe are not personally acquainted with the writings of John Calvin \u2026 neither do we care.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>When Reagan said government was the problem, he was channeling American history and zeal</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>From this history came the myth, reality and creed of self-reliant localism and suspicion of central authority. Reliance on government is for the faint and faithless of heart. When Reagan said government was the problem, he was channelling American history and zeal. </p> <p>Today, Trump is giving this civil religion voice in populist form, and because \u201cthrow the bastards out\u201d is rooted in US culture and worldview, it wins votes. </p> <p>In April 2016, the Public Religion Research Institute reported: \u201cTwo-thirds of Trump supporters think the nation needs a leader who breaks the rules\u201d (a ritual redux of Boston\u2019s \u201cthrow the bastards out\u201d Tea Party). Other Republican candidates had populist, small-government positions but lacked Trump\u2019s feathers-and-warpaint yelp. Ted Cruz came closest, which is one reason, along with his social conservatism, why he was second in line and why there is substantial support for his running in 2020.</p> <p>Even when Trump says he\u2019d keep governmental social security for retirees, his jeremiad is brimstone and hellfire for Washington. The more unflinchingly Trump preaches, the more it \u201cclicks\u201d with the national creed and the more satisfying it feels.</p> <p>Trump University taught: \u201cYou don\u2019t sell products, benefits or solutions \u2013 you sell feelings.\u201d Trump had no hand in the development of America\u2019s civil-religious anti-authoritarian feelings, but he taps into them.

  "<p>One of the last times I heard my sister laugh was when I tried to explain how I\u2019d been hired as an MC on the Star Trek cruise. Though she was dying of cancer, my devotion to the 50-year-old science fiction franchise could still inspire a chuckle and roll of the eyes. The very notion of a bunch of Trekkies waiting on line at the buffet with their phasers and tricorders strapped to their uniforms was a source of tremendous amusement, not that she knew the correct terms for these 23rd-century devices.

But I have difficulty remembering a time in my life before Star Trek and, what\u2019s more important, is that I don\u2019t recall when it hasn\u2019t been there for me.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d4cf8588de342ba5090242d06ef3a81caebb5a9b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d4cf8588de342ba5090242d06ef3a81caebb5a9b/0_0_3280_1967/1000.jpg\" alt=\"I don\u2019t speak klingon ...\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">I don\u2019t speak Klingon ...</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Moviestore/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Geek culture is dominant in our society, but the kids today need to understand the battles we fought in the 1980s. It would have been inconceivable, at least where I went to school, to read something like a Star Trek comic book in public back then. To be a Trekkie was to be closeted. In fact, to this day I have trouble with the term \u201cTrekkie\u201d. It was frequently used as a pejorative. (Some fans tried to turn this around and use Trekker, but Star Trek\u2019s creator <a href=\"http://capttrekker.blogspot.com/\">Gene Roddenberry himself said he liked Trekkie</a>, in case you were wondering.)</p> <p>But being an outcast and liking Star Trek is a causal loop: never has there been a show so essential for those who think of themselves as outsiders. The characters of Spock, Data, Odo, the Doctor and Seven of Nine are variations on the same theme \u2013 someone who wants to belong, but is principally incapable of doing so. Spock\u2019s half-Vulcan side forces him to suppress all emotion. Data\u2019s artificial origins prevent him from even having emotions to suppress! Odo doesn\u2019t know where he comes from, the Doctor is actually a collection of programmed sub-routines (he\u2019s made of light, but just go with me here) and Seven of Nine, emerged from a shattered childhood when taken in by her new crewmates, has to prove to them, and herself, that her Borg-enhanced biology is not a danger. (I can\u2019t speak to watching <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0112178/\">Star Trek: Voyager</a> as a pubescent girl, but the signifiers from her ratings-inspired, but still story-derived fitted costume is a remarkable treatise on sexuality-as-unintended-threat.)</p> <p>What\u2019s key, though, is that each of these characters \u2013 the characters that meant most to me and, I can tell you from attending conventions, mean the most to many of us \u2013 were still heroes. Moreover, they were accepted for what they are: weirdos set apart from the rest of the group, but actually quite necessary for the closed society of a Starship to excel. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"20da0f4953d1837f0404ab3c942a58711f1da45d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/20da0f4953d1837f0404ab3c942a58711f1da45d/0_0_1725_1184/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Star Trek: The Next Generation destigmatised mental health\" width=\"1000\" height=\"686\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Star Trek: The Next Generation destigmatised mental health.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cine Text/Sportsphoto Ltd/Allstar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Famously, Star Trek had a black woman on the bridge in 1966, had a black commander in 1993 and a female captain in 1995, but coming as I did from a left-leaning family, these specific benchmarks were meant to educate the bigots for who couldn\u2019t envision such faces in a true meritocracy. What was more unexpected for me was seeing Star Trek: The Next Generation destigmatize mental health with a ship\u2019s counselor in 1987. The Marxist utopia in Star Trek, hinted at originally but explored greater in the later series, was and remains as appealing to me as any of the photon torpedo-led action sequences.</p> <p>When I say Star Trek was always there for me, I don\u2019t only mean this in a metaphorical sense. A key component of its success is the unbelievable depth of the imagined world. For decades only Tolkien\u2019s Lord of the Rings could compete in terms of sheer volume. (But who <em>really</em> wants to read <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2014/may/28/review-j-r-r-tolkien-the-silmarillion\">The Silmarillion</a>? And besides, fantasy is cool and all, but science fiction rules.) To escape to the fantasy of Star Trek meant a little bit of work \u2013 one needs to know the difference between a <a href=\"http://memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/Bajoran\">Bajoran</a>, a <a href=\"http://memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/Bolian\">Bolian</a>, a <a href=\"http://memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/Betazoid\">Betazoid</a> and a <a href=\"http://memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/Benzite\">Benzite</a> \u2013 but this knowledge didn\u2019t just get you into a secret club, it could help you reflect back on the conflicts of the real world.</p> <p>Roddenberry wasn\u2019t really a science fiction nut, he was a writer that wanted to tell stories a bit too real for 1960s television. A script that dealt with racism on his first production, <a href=\"http://www.get.tv/the-lieutenant\">The Lieutenant</a>, effectively doomed the show despite good reviews and ratings. He pitched Star Trek as Wagon Train to the Stars, but had Jonathan Swift in mind. He wanted to talk about social issues, but needed cover to get it past timid sponsors. He hired sci-fi luminaries to create scripts and consulted with organizations like the <a href=\"http://www.rand.org/about.html\">Rand Corporation</a> to ensure that TV\u2019s first \u201cadult science fiction\u201d program could pass the sniff test. It\u2019s this meeting of the heart and head that made that first season of Star Trek 50 years ago so perfect.</p> <p>Its longevity \u2013 over 700 episodes, 14 films, numerous video games and a library of books and comics no one can ever give a precise figure to \u2013 gives it a ubiquity unheard of anywhere else in popular entertainment. Maybe Star Wars has more fans (and I love Star Wars) but it can\u2019t come within 12 parsecs when it comes to a cohesive, developed universe.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOUyqj9AFvM\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/JOUyqj9AFvM?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Of course, loving something means finding joy even in what may repulse others. I recognize that Leonard Nimoy\u2019s spoken word track Twinkle Twinkle Little Earth is not, by any reasonable metric, something one can call \u201cgood\u201d. And yet, like a phaser set to the lowest conceivable setting, few things warm my heart so quickly. I hear this tune and I picture my tape cassette briefcase that I brought with me to summer camp in 1989. On the top layer there\u2019s Led Zeppelin and Rush and Pink Floyd, but hidden on the bottom is <a href=\"http://www.allmusic.com/album/mr-spocks-music-from-outer-space-mw0000176667\">Mr Spock\u2019s Music From Outer Space</a>.</p> <p>Many fans, myself included, consider Star Trek the ultimate in comfort food. When something is going bad, grab a Blu-ray off the shelf or, even easier, click your remote and stream something. (The forthcoming new show, <a href=\"http://www.cbs.com/shows/star-trek-discovery/\">Star Trek: Discovery</a>, will be available on CBS\u2019s new streaming platform All Access, where every other episode is already waiting for you.) Bad day at school? Bad day at work? No work to be bad at? This is a crutch I\u2019ve leaned on many times.</p> <p>My young nephew, admittedly more of a Pok\u00e9mon and Minecraft fan, has been getting into Star Trek, and not just the fast-paced new movies. My niece has zero interest, and while the gender gap in fandom keeps shortening each year, I think I\u2019m OK with this as a legacy. When my sister was in her final stages this spring, turning to old Star Trek shows was a panacea for me. I didn\u2019t really watch them, but I would let them play, and take solace not just in their familiarity, but their optimism. The future will be better \u2013 Earth\u2019s races will unite, we\u2019ll overcome poverty, we\u2019ll travel faster than light, we\u2019ll all look good in tight velour clothing \u2013 even if right now it looks like the stars are burning out.</p>",
  "<p>I put my JustGiving page together one night in February, in about the time it takes to check Facebook after a day at work. It was easily the best 10 minutes I have ever spent. </p> <p>As a fan of <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006qpgr\">The Archers</a>, I had listened for months as smooth-talking snake-oil merchant Rob Titchener slowly crushed the life out of his partner, Helen. Rob had slowly shut down every aspect of Helen\u2019s life that he no longer agreed with: her friendships, her money, even her son, Henry; all of it nothing for her \u201cto worry about\u201d any more. The slow burn of the show made it excruciating listening: a slow-motion car crash was unfolding. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/sep/04/the-archers-call-to-help-domestic-abuse-victims-as-titchener-trial-starts\">The Archers: call to help domestic abuse victims as Titchener trial starts</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Helen was clearly in a lot of trouble. Why couldn\u2019t someone \u2013 anyone \u2013 help her? Which is when it suddenly dawned on me one night after a particularly harrowing episode. Why couldn\u2019t it be us? Why couldn\u2019t the audience set up a real rescue fund for real women, on behalf of Helen Titchener? </p> <p>I thought if I was really lucky and managed to get some traction on social media, we could, perhaps, make \u00a31,000 over a few weeks, which would be amazing. I quickly set up the <a href=\"https://www.justgiving.com/fundraising/helentitchener\">JustGiving page for a fictional character</a>, sent out a few speculative tweets, confessed that I may have gone a teensy bit mad to my friends on Facebook \u2013 and sat back. </p> <p>As notifications for the first \u00a310 or \u00a320 started to flow in almost straight away, I stared at them in astonishment. By the time I went to bed just after midnight, I had already hit the original target, just three hours after I launched it. I poured myself a stiff drink to celebrate and put the target up to \u00a33,000. Later the next day, we hit that too. </p> <p>For at least the first month the campaign (as it quickly became) took over my life. I was constantly checking my phone, which was constantly beeping with notifications of new donations, retweets and media enquiries. </p> <p>My wife, family (and employers) all had to put up with me being less than \u201cpresent\u201d through at least the first six weeks and I couldn\u2019t have done any of it without their support. It was exhausting and exhilarating, but a day spent with the brilliant team at Refuge HQ in London left me determined to keep the fund going. There I learned that if my final target of \u00a3150,000 is reached, and along with the gift aid, it will fund nearly 3,000 nights in a refuge for a family.</p> <p>So far, in just eight months, the Helen Titchener Rescue Fund has channelled a gobsmacking \u00a3135,000 and vast reserves of goodwill in the direction one of the country\u2019s great unsung charities. It\u2019s become part of a national conversation about domestic abuse and attracted support from everyone from Sir Patrick Stewart to Jo Brand to Frank Cottrell-Boyce. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/iamjobrand/status/695615968379326464\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Please help <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RefugeCharity\">@RefugeCharity</a> &amp; <a href=\"https://twitter.com/paultrueman74\">@paultrueman74</a> support women escaping <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/domesticviolence?src=hash\">#domesticviolence</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/AmXnSwAmnv\">https://t.co/AmXnSwAmnv</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/TheArchers?src=hash\">#TheArchers</a></p>&mdash; Jo Brand (@iamjobrand) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/iamjobrand/status/695615968379326464\">February 5, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Honestly though?

  "<p>An MP stood up in the commons on Wednesday and <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-37298109\">said she knew the names of men suspected of murdering six people.</a></p> <p>Her remarks elicited a quasi-apology from the government for failings by the police in their attempts to bring the murderers to justice.<br></p> <p>Did that exchange make any national newspaper front page? No. Did it get big headlines on any inside page? No. Did it get covered at all? Hardly.</p> <p>Why? Because the murders took place in Northern Ireland and the London-based national press has a long record of ignoring what happens there.</p> <p>So the readers of Britain\u2019s national papers were not told of the statement by Margaret Ritchie, the SDLP MP for South Down, in which she revealed she knew the identity of the men suspected of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/oct/15/northern-ireland-loyalist-shootings-loughinisland\">shooting six men to death in a bar in Loughinisland, in her constituency, in 1994.</a></p> <p>Nor did readers learn that Northern Ireland minister Kris Hopkins had said that the government \u201cdeeply regrets that the terrorists who committed these vicious attacks have never been brought to justice.\u201d<br></p> <p>Furthermore, readers were denied the chance to assess the prime minister\u2019s response to a question from Ritchie about the murders. Theresa May described them as a \u201cterrible evil\u201d but said it was for the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) to pursue the case.</p> <p>The whole point at issue is that the PSNI has not pursued the case despite a damning report published in June this year by the police ombudsman for Northern Ireland, Michael Maguire, in which he stated that he had \u201cno hesitation\u201d in concluding that police colluded with the killers.</p> <p>In that report, which superseded and corrected a previous report by Maguire\u2019s predecessor as ombudsman, he revealed both extensive police failings and clear evidence of collusion that enabled the killers to escape justice.</p> <p>It got precious little coverage at the time. Apart from<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jun/09/loyalist-informers-smuggled-weapons-used-in-dozens-troubles-murders-report-loughinisland\"> a detailed article in the Guardian</a> and <a href=\"http://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/police-colluded-with-loughinisland-killers-zrq778gc0\">a page lead in the Times</a>, it got two paragraphs in the Daily Telegraph, six pars in the Daily Mail and nothing in the other print titles.</p> <p>But where were the follow-ups? This is just the kind of story, had it happened in England (or Scotland, or Wales), it would surely have stimulated a newspaper campaign.</p> <p>The Maguire report exposed a scandal. It all but identified the presumed killers. It provided proof of a police cover-up. And, incidentally, it also revealed the existence of a police hero, a senior officer who was prepared to go against the grain.</p> <p>In other words, it had all the elements that for a classic popular press campaign on behalf of the Loughinisland victims and their bereaved families. </p> <p>Remember that superb <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2080159/Stephen-Lawrence-case-How-killers-finally-brought-justice.html\">Mail \u201cMurderers\u201d front page in 1997</a> because of police failures to bring the killers of Stephen Lawrence to justice? The power of the press, used properly in the public interest, was transformational.</p> <p>It shone the spotlight on the police. It encouraged whistle-blowers to come forward. It galvanised politicians. Press pressure worked. The Lawrence family were understandably grateful. </p> <p>The families of Adrian Rogan, Malcolm Jenkinson, Barney Greene, Daniel McCreanor, Patrick O\u2019Hare and Eamon Byrne deserve similar support. </p> <p>Newspapers based in Northern Ireland don\u2019t have the power (and most, I\u2019m afraid, don\u2019t have the will) to do what the Mail did for Lawrence.</p> <p>I commend my colleague Ian Cobain for his tireless work on the issue - examples <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/oct/15/northern-ireland-loyalist-shootings-loughinisland\">here</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/dec/20/northern-ireland-police-loughinisland-massacre-inquiry\">here</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/oct/15/uk-arms-northern-ireland-loyalist-massacre\">here</a> - but his has been a lone voice.<br></p> <p>What is required is for London-based national papers \u2013 the ones that campaigned so earnestly for Northern Ireland to remain part of the UK \u2013 to start taking an interest in what happened during the conflict.</p> <p>Taking up the case of the Loughinisland families would be an excellent start. Or am I being overly cynical in believing that the press\u2019s failure to get involved is because of its tacit support for collusion?</p> <p>If so, editors are guilty of condoning the mass murder of innocents. I really hope I am wrong about that.</p>",
  "<p><em tabindex=\"-1\">I\u2019m still running a 12-year-old Sony LCD TV and fancy something a bit bigger, but I don\u2019t want \u201csmart\u201d features that that will be dead before I buy another TV. I am a Virgin TV subscriber so my TiVo is smarter than most TVs, and I use an Amazon Prime TV Stick for streaming. I prefer to be able to upgrade these external devices as and when I please, rather than upgrade the whole TV when the smart part is no longer smart.</em> <strong tabindex=\"-1\">Lloyd</strong></p> <p>As the co-owner of another old but good Sony LCD TV, I feel your pain. It seems obvious to us that the TV industry should offer some reasonably priced, high-quality TV displays with lots of HDMI inputs and \u2013 hello Sony \u2013 a simple way to switch between feeds using a remote control. But if it does, they are hard to find in the UK.</p> <p>The TV industry understands the problem perfectly. Longtime TV and monitor expert Bob Raikes tells me that one of the standard sayings in the TV business is that \u201cyour smart TV is your stupid TV in two years time\u201d.</p> <p>He says: \u201cThe reality is that smart TV apps often start off looking slightly clunky compared to the latest tablet and smartphone apps. In two to three years, they will look even worse in comparison. Some TV makers have tried to fix this \u2013 well, Samsung, at least \u2013 by offering a modular upgrade for the smarts. I suspect almost nobody bought them, so they have stopped offering this feature.</p> <p>\u201cTV makers often claim that set-top boxes will be wiped out very soon. They won\u2019t. The key reason is that the upgrade cycle for the \u2018smarts\u2019 is 2-3 years, but the replacement cycle for TVs is 8-10 years.</p> <p>\u201cThe downside of buying a \u2018dumb\u2019 TV is that TV makers tend to put the best video processing and panels into their high-end sets. TVs with no smarts tend to be \u201centry level\u201d, where everything is built down to a price. I have believed for years that there is an enthusiast market for really good TVs (in visual quality) with only HDMI, but nobody seems to want to make them.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Dumb TVs</strong></h2> <p>Fortunately, it is easy to find relatively dumb TVs. That is to say, TV sets that usually offer a Freeview tuner or two, but no WebOS, Android or other operating system running apps. It\u2019s hard to complain about this. Free-to-air television is only available in the UK if you have a Freeview or Freesat tuner. A TV that didn\u2019t include a tuner would not be a TV set.</p> <p>In this case, Currys offers salvation. One of the product filters on its website is \u201cSmart TV\u201d. If you pick yes, you get a list of 167 TV sets. If you pick no, you get a choice of 40. This is more than I expected.</p> <p>Argos also lets you filter \u201cby Smart TV\u201d. In this case, yes gets you 180 options while no provides 80. The Argos offerings include its Alba and Bush brands, plus the odd set by Hisense, which is a giant supplier in the US. (By the way, John Lewis failed me for once. At least, I can\u2019t see a dumb TV filter on its website.)</p> <p>As you\u2019d expect, most dumb TVs have relatively small screen sizes. The TV business wants to sell large and expensive super-smart 4K TV sets. But at Currys, you still have a choice of one 48in Samsung TV (\u00a3359), one 49in JVC TV (\u00a3269), two 50in TV sets from Seiki (\u00a3260 and \u00a3279), and two 55in sets from Seiki (\u00a3309) and JVC (\u00a3349). All the online stores offer plenty of dumb TVs with smaller screens.</p> <p>You don\u2019t say how big a screen you want, but 48in seems a good step up from 32in.</p> <p>The selection of 40 dumb TVs at Currys includes 10 models with three HDMI ports. There is one model with four HDMI ports: the <a href=\"http://www.currys.co.uk/gbuk/tv-and-home-entertainment/televisions/televisions/seiki-se42ua01uk-4k-ultra-hd-42-led-tv-10147888-pdt.html\">42in Seiki SE42UA01UK LED TV</a> at \u00a3289. That looks like a good price for a 4K Ultra HD TV, but Argos has a top-brand model \u2013 a <a href=\"http://www.argos.co.uk/static/Product/partNumber/4559430.htm\">43in Philips 4K Ultra HD TV</a> \u2013 for even less: \u00a3279.99.</p> <p>If you fancy another Sony (which my wife usually does), then your best bet is the <a href=\"http://www.currys.co.uk/gbuk/tv-and-home-entertainment/televisions/televisions/sony-bravia-kdl40rd453bu-40-led-tv-10143389-pdt.html\">40in Bravia KDL40RD453BU</a>, which costs \u00a3299 at Currys. However, a 40in screen may not be a big enough jump on your 32in model, and it only has two HDMI ports.</p> <p>Samsung fans might prefer the <a href=\"http://www.currys.co.uk/gbuk/tv-and-home-entertainment/televisions/televisions/samsung-ue48j5100-48-led-tv-10132577-pdt.html\">48in UE48J5100</a> (Full HD, 1080p), which currently costs \u00a3359 at Currys. There\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.currys.co.uk/gbuk/tv-and-home-entertainment/televisions/televisions/samsung-ue40j5100-40-led-tv-10127112-pdt.html\">a 40in version</a> of the same TV at \u00a3289. Argos has a similar 55in <a href=\"http://www.argos.co.uk/static/Product/partNumber/5397639.htm\">Samsung UE55K5100</a> for \u00a3619.</p> <p>Your next task is to visit a few shops and see what your fancied TVs look like in real life. Obviously, prices may vary, and they can go up (thanks to a decline in the value of sterling) as well as down.</p> <h2>Accessories</h2> <p>There are lots of accessories for today\u2019s TV sets, including a plethora of stands, cables, loudspeakers and soundbars. Given that flat TV panels are not particularly conducive to high-quality sound, you might well consider including a <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Philips-HTL5140B-12-Soundbar-Subwoofer/dp/B00J2SBHQW/\">soundbar</a> in your budget. There are dozens, at a wide range of prices.</p> <p>Many TV sets also include Scart, composite and component video inputs, but if you really need a lot of HDMI ports, you could add an <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_2?url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;field-keywords=HDMI+switcher\">HDMI Switcher</a>. The basic idea is that you feed from two to (usually) five HDMI signals into a small box that has one HDMI output port to connect to your TV set. You switch between the inputs using a knob or a remote control. The <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/AVANTEK-High-Speed-Swither-Wireless-Supports/dp/B01ELFYSWK/\">Avantek 4\u00d71</a> is fairly typical example at \u00a322.99. You must check that it supports the resolutions you want, and is compatible with the streaming devices, disc players and games consoles you want to use.</p> <h2>How about a monitor?</h2> <p>You can buy display screens that don\u2019t have built in Freeview tuners: they are called computer monitors.</p> <p>Raikes points out that \u201cTV viewing tends to need higher brightness, so it\u2019s worth checking the brightness of the monitor. Quality TVs have a brightness of 500cd/m2, but monitors are typically between 200 and 350cd/m2. If you watch TV in the daytime in brightish conditions, it\u2019s worth looking for monitors with 300 or 350cd/m2.\u201d</p> <p>However, people sit close to computer monitors so even the big ones are generally around 32in, like your current TV set. You can buy larger monitors, but they\u2019re usually expensive. For example, Dell does a lovely <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Dell-E5515H-55-Inch-Full-Monitor/dp/B00RC1063Q/\">55in Full HD monitor</a> (350cd/m2) but it costs \u00a3792 or more.</p> <p>The monitors designed for public displays can be even more expensive. A <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/TH-55LF8W-LCD-Display-Format-Brightness/dp/B01AXYFWYQ/\">55in Panasonic TH-55LF8W</a> (500cd/m2) would set you back \u00a31,390. I think I\u2019d count this idea out ...</p> <p>Raikes has been a specialist in the display business since \u201cbefore IBM made a PC\u201d.

  "<p>As you jostle your way down Edinburgh\u2019s busy Royal Mile, the iconic thoroughfare of the Scottish capital\u2019s breathtaking Old Town, it\u2019s easy to miss the symbolic heart of the city unless you happen to glance down.<br></p> <p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_of_Midlothian_%28Royal_Mile%29\">The heart of Midlothian</a>, a mosaic of cobbles under foot, marks the entrance of the Old Tolbooth, the former administrative centre and notorious jail where prisoners were executed up until the 19th century. It\u2019s also a reminder that this is the historic centre of not only Edinburgh, but the nation.</p> <p>Just around the corner is the <a href=\"https://www.edinburgh.gov.uk/directory_record/5079/central_library\">Central Library</a>, opened in 1890. Above its arched entrance is the motto: \u201cLet there be light.\u201d</p> <p>But that light is now in jeopardy, according to campaigners. They are protesting against <a href=\"http://weareica.com/projects/india-buildings/?door=we-are-architects\">development plans</a> for a 235-bedroom hotel, restaurant, bar and retail space that will take over a site at the back of the library, on the Old Town\u2019s lower level street, the Cowgate.</p> <p>Campaigners see the plans \u2013 which include no additional housing or community spaces \u2013 as further proof of the over-development and gentrification of this part of the city, already bristling with bars, restaurants, clubs and hotels, which make up a <a href=\"http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/728\">Unesco world heritage site</a>.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.edinburghnews.scotsman.com/news/new-images-of-65m-india-buildings-hotel-development-1-3904954\">\u00a365m development proposal includes the historic cluster</a> known as India Buildings, which stretch around the corner of quaint Victoria Street, across from the Grassmarket. Developer <a href=\"http://www.jansonsproperty.com/\">Jansons Property</a> argues the scheme will help attract millions of pounds in visitor spending and bring new jobs to the area. It will also bring the <a href=\"https://www.historicenvironment.scot/advice-and-support/listing-scheduling-and-designations/listed-buildings/what-is-listing/#categories-of-listed-building_tab\">A-listed</a> India Buildings themselves back into use for the first time in 10 years, as well as two other listed buildings. \u201cThere are many positive aspects to this project,\u201d says Colin Smith, director of Turley, who acted as planning consultants on the project.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"2246fc86ceebe70aaa16dbed852b3a8f11ccd9d0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2246fc86ceebe70aaa16dbed852b3a8f11ccd9d0/0_276_4016_5019/800.jpg\" alt=\"Edinburgh Central Library.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Let there be light\u2019: Edinburgh Central Library.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Lawson/Belhaven/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But for locals it will mean the loss of land that was originally bequeathed to the city as space for a possible extension of the public library; one which many argue is badly needed. They claim the development, which reaches nine storeys at its highest point, will lower light levels within the library by as much as 80%, though developers say it will be far less.</p> <p>The development will also see the closure of the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.edinburghaccesspractice.scot.nhs.uk/opening-times.aspx\">Edinburgh Access Practice</a>, a drop-in NHS GP practice for some of the city\u2019s most marginalised communities, including homeless people and those with mental health problems and substance addictions. Though plans suggest another city centre location will be found, those working for and using the practice are uncertain about its future. One worker tells me the homeless people he works with are \u201cvoiceless\u201d here.</p> <p>But others are trying to raise their voices as loudly as possible. It\u2019s a Saturday in late August, and across the road from the India Buildings, in a packed room at the <a href=\"http://grassmarket.org/\">Grassmarket Community Project</a>, campaigners, locals and experts are gathered to discuss how best to make themselves heard. Though planning permission for the new hotel has been granted, they are trying to ensure the amenities remain in the hands of those who should benefit.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>The event is part of <a href=\"http://www.ourland.scot/\">Our Land</a> \u2013 a Scotland-wide festival running until mid-September to raise awareness of the need for land reform. The agenda here is about ensuring available land is used for public good.</p> <p>\u201cThere is a strong feeling among the Old Town community that there has been over-development \u2013 there are too many hotels,\u201d says veteran land reformer and Green MSP <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.andywightman.com/\">Andy Wightman</a>, who is one of the Our Land festival organisers. \u201cIt feels like this one is the straw that broke the camel\u2019s back.\u201d</p> <p>Simon Byrom, a member of the local community council who has lived on the fringes of the Old Town for most of his life, is one of six people camping out in the site in protest today. He says the heart of the area is slowly being ripped out.</p> <p>Byrom is the last owner-occupier on his stairwell; others are Airbnb flats, second homes or student lets. \u201cWe are heading to a place where we have little in the way of community any more,\u201d he says. </p> <p>Locals suggested that the gap site could host a community centre and garden and have even looked at the possibility of crowdfunding a buyout. \u201cBut the council seems to only listen to commercial interests, not those of the local community,\u201d he says.</p> <p>\u201cThat land had been set aside for the Central Library,\u201d Byrom explains. \u201cThe library was very specifically built with the intention of its extending. The motto \u2018Let there be light\u2019 tapped into the idea of the Enlightenment and the notion of the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/jun/12/scottish-people-losing-common-land\">\u2018common good\u2019 land</a>; the idea that you have a public space used for the good for humanity.\u201d</p> <p>In these times of austerity, Edinburgh is yet another heavily indebted council in the process of asset stripping, he says, leading local campaigners to talk about the city\u2019s \u201cAge of Endarkenment\u201d in sharp contrast to its Enlightenment heritage.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"0f53935b130b094c06b2c72721cde2bba687edcd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0f53935b130b094c06b2c72721cde2bba687edcd/98_107_3528_2117/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Not another hideous heartbreak hotel\u2019: local residents protest against the development.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Not another hideous heartbreak hotel\u2019: local residents protest against the development.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Simon Byrom</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Architect and fellow Old Town resident Neil Simpson claims the sale of publicly owned land has been mismanaged. He says there was no public consultation about the use of the site: \u201cIt\u2019s land owned by the public and there at least should be some recognition of the need for that to determine what kind of development can happen.\u201d</p> <p>As a large site, Simpson suggests there would have been room for amenities that would benefit everyone. \u201cUnder these plans there is one user and there could have been several. It is big enough to accommodate a hotel, housing, a GP practice and other amenities.\u201d</p> <p>Simpson claims the very design of the library is threatened by the proposals. \u201cThey will cast a shadow on the library. The double height windows are fundamental to its design but this will steal that light and views.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There has been a history of division in the city.

But he\u2019s finding it hard to find political backing.</p> <p>\u201cThe council promised to listen to local people but their promises have been utterly betrayed,\u201d he says. \u201cUnderlying all this is a sense that we cannot access democracy. We feel completely marginalised by the process.\u201d</p> <p>According to Alessandro Froldi, of the Edinburgh Against Gentrification campaign, the plans are deeply shortsighted. \u201cWe understand that there might not be money just now for an extension of the library, but selling this off instead for a luxury hotel is deeply disempowering for the community. There has been a history of division in the city; when you look at the mapping those on lower incomes live outside of it. But it\u2019s time to build bridges and build a city centre with social diversity.\u201d</p> <p>The row has moved past local protest. In February, Mechtild R\u00f6ssler, director of heritage at Unesco, <a href=\"http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/uk/scotland/article4698995.ece\">wrote to the UK government</a> calling for an overhaul of Edinburgh\u2019s planning system citing \u201cstrong concerns\u201d about the pace of development.</p> <p>It was thought seven of 12 proposed developments in city centre gap sites \u2013 the so-called <a href=\"http://www.investinedinburgh.com/the-edinburgh-12/\">Edinburgh 12</a> \u2013 were \u201cdeeply worrying\u201d, renewing fears that its world heritage status was at risk. The India Buildings development was one of those that flagged concern. Speaking at the Edinburgh International Culture summit in August, Francesco Bandarin, Unesco\u2019s assistant director-general for culture, claimed there was a lack of planning to protect the city\u2019s historic heart.</p> <p>Sean Bradley, chair of the <a href=\"http://eotdt.org/\">Old Town Development Trust,</a> moved to the Grassmarket in the 1970s with his family when it had reputation as a no-go area \u2013 a run down part of town populated by homeless hostels.</p> <p>By the time the regeneration plans for the Grassmarket were put forward (by the late Robin Cook, then MP for <a href=\"https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/uk/edinburgh\">Edinburgh</a> Central), the population of the Old Town had fallen to about 3,500.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"12b0adbaf67eba1c21970e95a34cf9c5204235f1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/12b0adbaf67eba1c21970e95a34cf9c5204235f1/0_319_5141_3086/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Victoria Street\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The popular destination of Victoria Street, where the India Buildings are located.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a far more difficult place to live now than it ever was then,\u201d he says. Though the Old Town has been his home for more than four decades, Bradley is thinking of quitting; he\u2019s fed up with the lack of amenities for locals and the fact that their needs are not considered in the planning process. Not everyone has this option, though \u2013 those living in social housing are stuck with the disturbances, he notes.</p> <p>Though the Old Town Development Trust is involved in some positive steps \u2013 including gardening projects to make the community more visible to tourists \u2013 he is far from convinced that it can influence anything of substance. \u201cThis city has a very cynical nature to taking people\u2019s views,\u201d Bradley adds.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.edinburgh.gov.uk/\">Edinburgh City Council</a> disagrees. In June it ran a public consultation seeking views on development in the Old Town along with information events, and has plans to be \u201cmore innovative\u201d about the way it involves residents. It insists it takes its role in protecting Edinburgh\u2019s heritage seriously.</p> <p>\u201cIt is inevitable that new developments will be attracted to the centre, and this is important for the city to evolve,\u201d says councillor Ian Perry. \u201cWe are committed to managing this process carefully and ensuring that the greatest consideration is given to its historic environment. Listening to the views of residents in the area is important to ensure the future success of the site.\u201d</p> <p>His stance is backed by <a href=\"http://www.gov.scot/\">the Scottish government</a>, which also stresses that people must have an opportunity to \u201cengage in development decisions that affect them\u201d as part of the planning process.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/mar/29/story-of-cities-10-edinburgh-new-town-old-town-scottish-enlightenment-james-craig\">Story of cities #10: how the dirty Old Town became enlightened Edinburgh</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s extremely clear is that if human rights were properly embedded in policy then the city should be planned around the needs of the people,\u201d says Wightman. There have been positive developments in Scottish policy including the introduction of the <a href=\"http://www.gov.scot/Topics/People/engage/CommEmpowerBill\">Community Empowerment Act</a> last year, which extends the community right to buy, making it simpler for them to take over public sector land and buildings, and aims to put community planning as a statutory obligation. But Wightman is among those who believe the <a href=\"http://www.parliament.scot/parliamentarybusiness/Bills/90675.aspx\">Land Reform Act</a> does not go far enough, and that planning reform is urgently needed.</p> <p>City centre communities must be protected, he says. \u201cIt has to be a normal place to live. Places that are over-developed can become like an open-air museum \u2013 inauthentic and not interesting. The people need to make better demands of those who are representing them. Part of the fight back has to be to take control of the agenda.\u201d</p> <p>Back in the Cowgate, campaigners are trying to do just that. \u201cNot another hideous heartbreak hotel\u201d read the banners.

They go outside, they get a doctor, they get a prescription, they do what they have to do, and we pay the bill. That is something that I have been praised \u2013 and, by the way, I never said take the VA, take the Veterans Administration private. I wouldn\u2019t do that. Too much respect for our people.

  "<p>In 1782, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2014/jan/20/rousseau-compassionate-intense-relevant-philosopher\" title=\"\">Jean-Jacques Rousseau</a>\u2019s <em>Les Confessions</em> was published \u2013 the first modern autobiography and, two and a half centuries on, still something of a shocking, startling read. Rousseau unburdens himself; he tells you everything about himself: his many sins, sexual foibles, fantasies, the casual discarding of his illegitimate children, and so on. He writes on the opening page (I paraphrase): \u201cThis is what I have done and this is what has been done to me. If on occasion I have added some innocent embellishment, it has been only to fill the odd defect of memory. Sometimes I may have taken for a fact what was no more than a probability, but I have never put down as true what I knew to be false.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/ng-interactive/2016/sep/03/tinker-tailor-writer-spy-the-many-lives-of-john-le-carre-in-his-own-words\">Tinker, tailor, writer, spy: the many lives of John le Carr\u00e9, in his own words</a> </p> </aside>  <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/ng-interactive/2016/sep/03/tinker-tailor-writer-spy-the-many-lives-of-john-le-carre-in-his-own-words\" title=\"\">John le Carr\u00e9</a> (AKA David Cornwell) begins <em>The Pigeon Tunnel</em> with a similar defence: \u201cThese are true stories told from memory \u2013 to which you are entitled to ask, what is truth and what is memory? \u2026 But please be assured: Nowhere have I consciously falsified an event or a story. Disguised where necessary, yes. Falsified, emphatically not. And where my memory is shaky, I&#xa0;have taken care to say so.\u201d All rather Rousseau-esque, but any reader expecting any revelations of the <em>Les Confessions</em> variety is going to be disappointed: <em>The&#xa0;Pigeon Tunnel</em> carefully swerves around and away from all the more interesting, controversial, secret and personal aspects.</p> <p>Indeed, we are familiar with the broad details of Le Carr\u00e9\u2019s life, because just under a year ago, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jan/15/john-le-carre-adam-sisman-biography-review\" title=\"\">Adam Sisman</a> published a closely scrutinised 672-page biography. Cornwell was a willing participant, granting Sisman more than 50 hours of interviews and access to his papers. Sisman\u2019s book answered all the questions Le&#xa0;Carr\u00e9 watchers had been asking for&#xa0;years.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It\u2019s fair to say that virtually everything that is in The Pigeon Tunnel is covered by Sisman\u2019s biography</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>So why <em>The Pigeon Tunnel</em> now, less than a year later? Is it a kind of riposte to Sisman\u2019s shrewdly forensic anatomising of Le Carr\u00e9\u2019s 80-something years? It is salutary to compare Le Carr\u00e9\u2019s account of certain episodes with those&#xa0;narrated by Sisman. Although there are some episodes that Sisman doesn\u2019t relate and some people Le Carr\u00e9 meets whom Sisman doesn\u2019t describe, I think it\u2019s fair to say that virtually everything that is in <em>The Pigeon Tunnel</em> is covered, one way or another, by Sisman\u2019s biography.</p> <p>To take a single telling example, Le&#xa0;Carr\u00e9, while researching his novel <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/little-drummer-girl.html?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\" title=\"\"><em>The Little Drummer Girl</em></a> (1983), had the&#xa0;opportunity to meet Yasser Arafat. Here is Le Carr\u00e9:</p> <blockquote> \u201cMr David,\u201d [Arafat] cries. \u201cWhy have you come to see me?\u201d <br>\u201cMr Chairman,\u201d I reply in the same high tone. \u201cI have come to put my hand on the Palestinian heart!\u201d <br>Have we been rehearsing this stuff? He is already guiding my right hand to the left breast of his khaki shirt. It&#xa0;has a button down pocket, perfectly ironed \u2026 <br>\u201cMr David, it is here!\u201d he cries fervently, \u201cIt is here!\u201d He repeats for the benefit of our audience. <br>We enter an Arab embrace. Left, right, left. The beard is not bristle, it\u2019s silky fluff. It smells of Johnson\u2019s baby powder. </blockquote> <p>And here is Sisman\u2019s version:</p> <blockquote> [Arafat] was wearing a silver coloured pistol and a perfectly pressed uniform. And he smelled of baby powder. The stubble on his cheeks, as they entered the traditional embrace, was silky, not prickly. <br>\u201cMr John, why have you come here?\u201d he demanded, placing his hands on David\u2019s shoulders, while scanning his eyes like a worried doctor. <br>\u201cMr Chairman,\u201d David said, \u201cI\u2019ve come to put my hand on the Palestinian heart.\u201d <br>Arafat seized David\u2019s hand and placed it to his breast. His own hand was soft as a girl\u2019s. \u201cMr John, it is here, it is here.\u201d </blockquote> <p>Biographer and autobiographer in almost perfect accord. Just the odd nuance of difference: \u201cMr David\u201d in one, \u201cMr John\u201d in the other. But what is memory and what is truth? Le Carr\u00e9 confesses that he does not keep a journal \u2013 perhaps an omission that he would wish undone. The clue, I think, lies in the word \u201cnuance\u201d. In his introduction, Le Carr\u00e9 writes, \u201cReal truth lies, if anywhere, not in facts, but in nuance.\u201d And who better to convey the nuances but the person who actually had the experiences?</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Real truth lies, if anywhere, not in facts, but in nuance</p> <footer> <cite>John le Carr\u00e9</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But I believe there is another, entirely human, motivation that lies behind the writing of <em>The Pigeon Tunnel</em>. And again Sisman supplies the&#xa0;spur. Only once, glancingly, does&#xa0;Le&#xa0;Carr\u00e9 refer to Sisman\u2019s authorised biography, when he remarks \u2013 somewhat disingenuously \u2013 that \u201ca recently published account of my life offers thumbnail versions of one or two of the stories, so it naturally pleases me to reclaim them as my own, tell them in my own voice and invest them as best as I can with my own feeling.\u201d As we\u2019ve seen, the \u201cthumbnail versions\u201d are far more than that, but Le&#xa0;Carr\u00e9\u2019s justification in retelling them \u201cin my own voice\u201d is very easy to&#xa0;understand, and his explanation seems entirely&#xa0;honest.</p> <p>It must be very hard to read a 672-page version of your life where all manner of private matters \u2013 about your parents, upbringing, marriages, children, love affairs, arguments, mistakes, feuds, earnings and tax arrangements \u2013 are revealed to a reading public as a matter of historical record. I think anyone can comprehend the urge to say: well, it wasn\u2019t exactly like that, it was more like this.</p> <p>There is a lot that is of interest, even&#xa0;though the thornier incidents (the spying; his friendship with James Kennaway and the affair with Kennaway\u2019s wife, Susan; the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/nov/12/salman-rushdie-john-le-carre\" title=\"\">Salman Rushdie feud</a>) all go unmentioned and uncommented on. Le Carr\u00e9 has plenty to say about Kim Philby, the movie business, fellow spooks and Russian defectors, encounters with the great and good, and his intrepid travels to research his novels. It is well written, pithy and not in the least&#xa0;vainglorious.</p> <p>The best chapter is about his extraordinary father, Ronnie Cornwell \u2013 conman, part-time millionaire, bankrupt, compulsive liar, sentimentalist, Mason and jailbird. In some ways, everything about Cornwell is explained by their relationship. Le Carr\u00e9 analyses it with great unblinking honesty.</p> <blockquote> Englishmen, we are told, are branded on the tongue, and in those days being well spoken could gain you a military commission, bank credit, respectful treatment from policemen and a job in the City of London. It\u2019s one of the ironies of Ronnie\u2019s mercurial life that, by realising his ambition of sending my brother and me to posh schools he placed himself socially below us by the cruel standards of the time. Tony and I were whisked effortlessly through the class barrier while Ronnie remained stuck on the other&#xa0;side. </blockquote> <p>Nothing much has changed for the&#xa0;English, but this level of insight is&#xa0;rare in this agreeable, chatty book. The more you know about Le Carr\u00e9, the more you will relish <em>The Pigeon Tunnel </em>(the title refers to shooting real&#xa0;pigeons, as opposed to clay ones). Paradoxically, and perhaps irritatingly for the author, this autobiography serves to underline the general excellence of Sisman\u2019s biography.</p> <p>That being said, this is a fascinating and important book (I would urge an index for the paperback). Anyone interested in Le Carr\u00e9 and his significant contribution to the literature of the 20th and 21st centuries will want to&#xa0;read these engaging meanderings through various aspects of his life and career. Crucially, hearing these stories retold, and reclaimed, in Cornwell\u2019s own voice is the real bonus. Perhaps the truth does lie in the&#xa0;nuances.</p> <p>\u2022 To order <em>The Pigeon Tunnel</em> for \u00a315 (Viking, RRP \u00a320), go to <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/pigeon-tunnel.html?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\" title=\"\">bookshop.theguardian.com</a> or call 0330 333 6846.

We both recognise that solving this problem will take time. Our claim to the Malvinas will be sustained, but as part of the approach of a good neighbour. </p> <p>\u201cWe think over the long term a solution can be found but in the meantime we can and should be respectful, and find ways to open up the opportunities for confidence-building measures. There has been a zero-sum approach, but we think if we sit at the table, and are positive and creative there are alternatives.\u201d</p> <p>She added that 80% of Anglo-Argentinian relations were cooperative, and the task was to work on the remaining 20%.</p> <p>At present only Chile currently has an approved air route to the Falklands after the government of N\u00e9stor Kirchner banned charter flights from passing through Argentinian air space.

She argued her country might be willing to lift restrictions on air flights from Latin America if some of the flights went direct to Buenos Aires.</p> <p>She also pointed out that an International Red Cross delegation had visited the Falklands to start the process of identifying the bodies of Argentinian soldiers buried on the islands.</p> <p>Malcorra is in London for a major conference on UN peacekeeping, and proposed reforms to make the performance of the peacekeepers much more accountable after successive stories of UN forces sexually exploiting or abusing the population they have been sent to protect.</p> <p>She insisted that most UN peacekeepers behaved, but she proposed national governments be required to sign a compact making them clearly accountable for the actions of their soldiers and police. In addition, she called for an ombudsman answerable to the UN general assembly and responsible for an annual public report on the performance of peacekeepers. \u201cIt is a name and shame approach. At present each set of troops are reporting to their own commander in chiefs, and the UN can only report about a problem. This needs to change.\u201d</p> <p>With the Chinese warming to her candidacy and the US supportive, the biggest stumbling block to Malcorra\u2019s candidature may be the attitude of the Russians and her status as former chief of staff to Ban Ki-moon.<br></p> <p>The Russians in principle back a candidate from eastern Europe, on the basis that it is the region\u2019s turn to run the world body, but she is drawing support with her appeal to rein in the mushrooming UN bureaucracy, focus on results and bring a remote bureaucracy closer to the people.</p> <p>With her experience in the private sector as well as 10 years at the UN, Malcorra has experience of breaking glass ceilings and added: \u201cI have an insider-outsider perspective. I have the advantage of knowing enough about what needs to change without being so deeply ingrained in the bureaucracy as to be run by it.\u201d</p> <p>The prospect of another man being selected for the post \u2013 the current frontrunner is the former Portuguese prime minister Ant\u00f3nio Guterres \u2013 leaves her exasperated. \u201cLooking at the female candidates, it would be a surprise to me if the UN decides that none of them merits appointment. It has been 70 years that men have been at the helm.\u201d </p>",
  "<p>When Charles Montgomery first started talking about urban happiness, people laughed at him. As his colleague Omar Dominguez explains, \u201chappiness is kind of an out-there concept for some people\u201d.</p> <p>Montgomery and Dominguez work at <a href=\"http://thehappycitylab.com/\">Happy City</a>, a Canadian organisation named after Montgomery\u2019s 2013 book, which makes the case for retrofitting cities for happiness and argues that streets, parks, shopping centres, housing estates \u2013 indeed most urban infrastructure \u2013 can be designed to make people feel happier, behave better and be kinder.</p> <p>\u201cIf we give a damn about human wellbeing in cities, we need to study the emotional effects of spaces and systems,\u201d says Montgomery. \u201cWe need to use evidence to help fix the horrific mistakes we\u2019ve made over the last century.\u201d</p> <p>To beat the sceptics, the team at Happy City gathers evidence from psychology, neuroscience, public health and behavioural economics. They know that hospital patients who can see trees through their bedside windows <a href=\"http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/nature-that-nurtures/\">heal faster than those who only see brick walls</a>. They know that commuters at rush hour <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2004/nov/30/research.transport\">suffer more anxiety than fighter pilots or riot police</a> facing angry mobs. They even know that the friendliest front gardens are <a href=\"https://www.fastcoexist.com/3021478/how-urban-design-influences-how-many-friends-you-have\">precisely 10.6ft deep</a>.</p> <p>And they conduct their own research, particularly around Montgomery\u2019s theory that the most important ingredient for human happiness is social connection. <a href=\"http://thehappycitylab.com/project/the-happy-city-experiment/\">An experiment in Seattle</a> found that passersby are four times more likely to help lost tourists on lively streets filled with lots of small shops than on pristine, but essentially characterless, blocks, where people tend to move more quickly.</p> <p>\u201cWe think the kindness effect was a result of velocity,\u201d says Montgomery. \u201cPeople are nicer to each other when they move more slowly and have time to make eye contact.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/aug/17/urban-planners-improve-mental-health-cities\">Building better mental health in cities from the ground up</a> </p> </aside>  <p>At the Project for Public Space conference in Vancouver from 12 to 15 September 2016, <a href=\"http://thehappycitylab.com/groundbreaking-public-experiment-on-happy-streets-coming-to-vancouver-for-placemaking-week/\">Happy City will host walking tours of the city</a>.

With one foot in research and another in urban planning, Happy City tries to bridge the gap between them. It is a consultancy, advising local governments, developers and any other organisations that have control over how cities grow, including the World Health Organisation.</p> <p>Montgomery says he\u2019s seen an \u201cexplosion of interest in the field\u201d of happiness and urban planning over the past three years \u2013 and not just from Scandinavian countries. \u201cI\u2019m especially thrilled to see that property developers are embracing the wellbeing agenda,\u201d he says.</p> <p><a href=\"http://thehappycitylab.com/project/wellbeing-principles-for-british-land/\">Happy City has helped British Land</a>, the UK\u2019s largest real estate investment trust, to weave wellbeing principles into its new development practices.<br></p> <p>\u201cBut we\u2019re seeing an awakening in other parts of the world, too,\u201d says Montgomery, referring to Ahura Builders, which invited Happy City to hack the designs for a community of 8,000 people in Punawale, India. \u201cOur happiness interventions included breaking up imposing superblocks, investing in quiet streets that are safe and friendly for pedestrians and creating a village heart to which residents could walk and shop.\u201d<br></p> <p>Another project was based in Mexico City. Chaotic, crowded and with high levels of crime, it\u2019s an unusual setting for the happiness agenda. But in the autumn of 2014 the local government\u2019s innovation unit commissioned Happy City to do a three-day <a href=\"http://thehappycitylab.com/project/happy-neighbourhood-audit/\">\u201chappiness audit\u201d of Colonia Doctores</a>, a poor neighbourhood in the south-west of the city.<br></p> <p>Dominguez, Happy City\u2019s director of operations and sustainability, gathered together public officials, city planners, architects and \u2013 most importantly \u2013 local residents. On the first day they discussed key principles that influence wellbeing, such as access to nature and the ability to have positive social interactions on a daily basis.<br></p> <p>\u201cOne of the key concerns in Mexico is safety. What people do when they\u2019re concerned about their safety is to fortify,\u201d says Dominguez. \u201cActually, one of the best things you can do is generate a sense of trust and calm.\u201d<br></p> <p>On the second day the group toured Colonia Doctores, applying the principles to physical aspects of the neighbourhood and on the third they presented their findings. Recommendations included opening a new museum and pedestrianising an area outside the local wrestling arena, turning it into a cultural corridor around Mexican wrestling. \u201cThat sense of community is good for their wellbeing,\u201d says Dominguez. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/healthcare-network/2016/jun/08/city-living-bad-for-health\">Is city living bad for your health?</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>\u2018Happiness is good for the bottom line\u2019</h2> <p>One thing the Happy City team is really passionate about is making the business case for happiness. \u201cBuilding healthier, happier places is not more expensive.

  "<p>Apple has unveiled the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, its next generation smartphones, which have a similar aluminium look but now waterproof with new insides, new pressure-sensitive home button, new dual-camera features and no headphone socket.<br></p> <p>Apple\u2019s senior vice president of worldwide marketing, Phil Schiller, took to the stage at the Bill Graham Civic Auditorium in San Francisco to announce the smartphone, the first to launch with the company\u2019s latest iOS 10 software for iPhone and iPad with improved notifications and messaging features.</p> <p>The biggest change to the new iPhone, however, is the removal of the universal 3.5mm headphone jack, which used to be cut into the bottom of the smartphone and is common to almost all forms of audio-producing electronics. Instead, Apple hopes users will embrace the Lightning port, which is commonly used for power and file transfers, for audio, or wireless headphones such as those made by Apple\u2019s Beats headphones brand.</p> <p>Lightning connector headphones and a Lightning-to-analogue adapter will be included with the new iPhone.</p> <p>Schiller said: \u201cApple EarPods are the most popular headphones in the world. Now we\u2019re moving them to Lightning. Why? Because it provides digital audio, power, and many other advantages that are simply not possible over an analogue connection.</p> <p>\u201cThe analogue headphone jack has been with us for a very long time. But the reason to move on is courage. The courage to move on and do something new that betters all of us.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e4a4a19ab536585b501441fd7a725fcb4c2bdacc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e4a4a19ab536585b501441fd7a725fcb4c2bdacc/0_233_5472_3283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"AirPods\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Apple\u2019s new in-ear wireless earphones, AirPods.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stephen Lam/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Apple also announced a new set of its EarPod in-ear buds, this time without the cable, called AirPods, which it hopes will ease the transition from the headphones port. </p> <p>Bluetooth headphones are widely available in a range of prices and capabilities, and have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/sep/05/apple-headphone-jack-iphone-7-lightning-usb-c-port\">become popular in the past two years</a>, but truly wireless in-ear buds have struggled to overcome the technological constraints of short battery life and weak connectivity. Several new models released this year from companies such as Motorola, Bragi and Samsung hope to solve those problems.</p> <p>Phil Schiller, senior vice president of worldwide marketing, said: \u201cUp until now no one has taken on the challenge of fixing the things that are difficult to do in the wireless experiences so we can all enjoy them. So that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing with the Apple AirPods.\u201d</p> <p>AirPods will cost $170 and be available in late October. Apple\u2019s headphone brand Beats will also release new wireless models.</p> <h2>Faster A10 Fusion chip</h2> <p>As with all previous iPhone updates, the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus have faster, more powerful processors \u2013 the Apple A10 Fusion replacing the A9 from last year\u2019s iPhone 6S \u2013 with the outside of the new smartphones seeing subtle changes in design.</p> <p>The new quad-core A10 Fusion processor will have 120 times the performance of the original iPhone and Apple says it will also extend battery life through improved power efficiencies.</p> <p>Apple estimates that the iPhone 7 will deliver, on average, two more hours of battery life than the iPhone 6S.</p> <p>The iPhone 7 comes in a new gloss black colour and has hidden the previously visible antenna lines on the back marking a couple of small visual tweaks to the new phones over predecessors. The new iPhone is also now waterproof to IP67 standards, bringing it into line with rivals from Samsung and others.</p> <p>The home button has also been tweaked to use a similar pressure-sensitive technology as Apple\u2019s MacBook trackpads and the 3D touch screen of the iPhone 6S, which simulate movement using a small vibrating sensation when pressed without actually depressing. The new button will allow further gesture control and could pave the way for the button to be removed entirely in subsequent version of the smartphone.</p> <p>For many, the home button has been one of the weak points of the iPhone, requiring replacement which has proved tricky due to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/feb/19/error-53-apple-issues-fix-bricked-iphones\">fingerprint sensor and secure chip hidden underneath</a>.</p> <h2>Plus dual-camera</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"50169b4d73f7e1178e7807bb852f4207c2159591\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/50169b4d73f7e1178e7807bb852f4207c2159591/0_137_4096_2458/1000.jpg\" alt=\"iphone 7 plus\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The iPhone 7 Plus will have two cameras on the back.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Monica Davey/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The iPhone 7 will also have an improved camera system to keep up with rivals. The iPhone used to have the best camera in the business, but the iPhone 6S faced stiff competition from not only Samsung, but HTC, LG and rising star Chinese firm Huawei.</p> <p>The camera now has a faster, larger 12-megapixel sensor, a faster f1.8 lens for better low-light photography and an enhanced true-tone flash. All versions of the iPhone will now have optical image stabilisation, not just the larger Plus models.</p> <p>The update will see a new dual-camera fitted to the back of the larger iPhone 7 Plus - one 12-megapixel telephoto lens and one 12-megapixel wide-angle lens - similar to those fitted to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/may/11/lg-g5-review-power-users-friend-that-just-misses-mark\">LG\u2019s G5</a>. Both Huawei and LG have released smartphones in the last year using two cameras on the back to varying degrees of success.</p> <p>Apple allows optical zoom now up to 2x with both lenses, using digital zoom to go beyond. A free update will also allow users to blur the background using both lenses to judge distance and create a bokeh effect, similar to software effects produced by rivals.</p> <p>Schiller said: \u201cOn a dSLR you can move lens elements to zoom with a large lens. But on a phone you can\u2019t do that. So we\u2019re using two cameras and two lenses to do the same. The quality of the zoom, even with software zoom, is so much better than before we decided to push it up to 10x.\u201d</p> <p>The iPhone 7 will be available in four colours starting on 16 September at $649 for 32GB of storage - increased from last year\u2019s 16GB base storage with 128GB and 256GB options. The iPhone 7 Plus will cost from $769, again with 32GB of storage. The jet-black models will be 128GB and 256GB variants only.</p> <p>Last year\u2019s iPhone 6S, 6S Plus and the iPhone SE will be still available, now starting with 32GB of storage. The iPhone upgrade programme will also be made available in the UK.</p> <h2>Tick, tock, tock?</h2> <p>Until now, Apple\u2019s smartphones have had a complete redesign every two years according to its traditional release schedule, with improved processors and a few new features every other year making up the \u201ctock\u201d in the cycle. Intel and others also use the tick, tock product cycle, traditionally displaying improved battery life on the tick.</p> <p>The iPhone 6 was the tick, which means the iPhone 6S was the tock. The iPhone 7\u2019s use of the similar industrial design of previous iPhones plus new colours bucks the trend, meaning the new iPhone could be considered as a second-such tock. Whether improved specifications and a few new features, some of which will come to 2015\u2019s iPhone 6S through software updates, will be enough to continue to woo customers remains to be seen.</p> <p>\u201cApple\u2019s biggest challenge is how to manage its large install base \u2013 the biggest in the industry \u2013 and convince them to replace their smartphones and spend more on services and in the company\u2019s ecosystem,\u201d said Francisco Jeronimo IDC\u2019s research director for European mobile devices. \u201cAs we approach 80-85% smartphone penetration, it\u2019s no longer about people buying their first smartphone but attracting customers from rivals.\u201d</p> <p>In the UK, Apple is fighting a war with chief rival Samsung over the 20% of users that switch between operating systems. It scored the most switchers with the iPhone 6, which introduced new screen sizes, but now it must attempt to convince users to upgrade from previous iPhones.</p> <ul> <li><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/sep/05/apple-headphone-jack-iphone-7-lightning-usb-c-port\">Does Apple really think we\u2019re ready to ditch the headphone jack?</a><br></strong></li> <li><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/sep/04/iphone-7-apple-needs-to-impress-chinese-coming-samsunfg-steadfast\">The Chinese are coming.

Murray had his chances converting eight of 15 break points, but the Japanese world No7 made more of the key moments.</p> <p>Nishikori, a losing finalist against Marin Cilic here two years ago, was well worth his 1-6, 6-4, 4-6, 6-1, 7-5 win in three hours and 57 minutes on Arthur Ashe Court \u2013 with the roof ludicrously shut after a brief drizzle.</p> <p>Murray will remember it for many ups and downs, not least the let and replayed point called against him in the fourth set \u2013 the result of an electrical malfunction in the court\u2019s sound system that set off a loud, distracting noise \u2013 which seriously unsettled him and contributed significantly to a dramatic loss of focus and, ultimately, the match.</p> <p>Nishikori, who drop-shotted Murray to distraction, said: \u201cI tried to hit a little more drop shots than usual. I know he stays back. It worked really well.\u201d</p> <p>Murray said: \u201cI wasn\u2019t too disappointed. I\u2019ve had a good few months. I\u2019m sorry not to have won but there you go.\u201d</p> <p>Familiar patterns emerged early. Nishikori smoked his ground strokes from the first rally but the Scot saved three break points and held with an ace. Early in the first set Murray seemed distracted (a phrase oft repeated) by a minor noise from the PA system. He complained to the chair umpire, Marija Cicak, who told him they would have to play through the interruptions. It was a pledge Murray would not forget.</p> <p>He wrapped up the first set with a 133mph ace and all seemed well. Receiving, Nishikori looked like someone at the wrong end of a shooting gallery.</p> <p>A few drops of rain threatened a roof closure but they played on after a brief pause. Nishikori heaved his shoulders in frustration and thought about bashing his racket into the court as he threw away his serve for 2-3 in the second.</p> <p>After a little more than an hour it was not going well for him. But Murray gave up three break points in the sixth game and Nishikori cashed in with a searing crosscourt forehand to break back.</p> <p>At 3-all, 40-30 on Nishikori\u2019s serve, the rain returned. After 71 minutes of outdoor tennis they closed the roof. When they returned, Nishikori won the point and they were on level terms \u2013 with the sun shining outside.What is officially an open-air tournament now presented an important quarter-final as an indoor match and in the next 20 minutes everything changed. Nishikori, revitalised and refocused, upped his game and broke Murray\u2019s serve to level at a set apiece.</p> <p>An exchange of breaks at the start of the third did not encourage wholesale confidence in either player. A third double fault of the match for Nishikori handed Murray his eighth break point in the seventh game and he happily watched his opponent\u2019s loose backhand stray wide to hand him an unexpected lead.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bfda2f7b217c1f9c93d627c5db25d13466d43952\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bfda2f7b217c1f9c93d627c5db25d13466d43952/0_227_2664_1598/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Andy Murray\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Andy Murray shows his frustration after losing a point against Kei Nishikori in their quarter-final.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Don Emmert/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There was life in Nishikori yet, mind. When Murray sent down his biggest thunderbolt to that point, 135mph, at 40-15, he stood his ground and delivered a stunning return, then fought to deuce. Surely he could not break back straight away again. Yes, he could. After a long and nervous rally Murray shoved one long and his head dropped to his chest in despair.</p> <p>This was profligacy on a grand scale. Murray needed to rediscover the blinding consistency of the first set, when he looked like running away with the match. Instead he was hanging on.</p> <p>Nishikori mirrored Murray and handed the advantage back with a lazy backhand. There now was no telling where this match was going as Murray stepped up to serve for a 2-1 lead. The serve, it seemed, had become a liability for both of them but Murray thrashed a winner down the line at the first opportunity.</p> <p>Midway through the point at 1-1 and 30-40 on Nishikori\u2019s serve in the fourth set, the umpire yelled \u201cLet. Replay the point\u201d after more outside electrical interference on her sound system. Murray, desperate for a break, dumped his backhand and was livid with himself and Cacik. He was even less impressed when he butchered his return of an 81mph second serve and not at all happy when Nishikori drop-shotted him to hold.</p> <p>It was a significant interruption. Nishikori consolidated his hold by breaking for 3-1. Murray, who was was still seething, lost 12 of the next 14 points and, when Nishikori lobbed him on the charge to lead 4-1, a minor crisis loomed.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/picture/2016/sep/08/sport-picture-of-the-day-andy-murray-fires-a-forehand\">Sport picture of the day: Andy Murray fires a forehand</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Another noise interrupted Murray\u2019s shot at 30-0 in the sixth game \u2013 aided by a pesky butterfly in his sight line \u2013 and, saving two break points in a tortuous struggle, he found himself 1-5 down.</p> <p>In five-setters Murray was 23-7, Nishikori 13-5 but the mood here was different and Nishikori broke in the first game of the fifth set to send a strong wave of anxiety through the Scot\u2019s box.</p> <p>Like a welcome breeze in the desert, Murray held and broke to 15 for parity as Nishikori cracked under sustained pressure. Yet, with uncanny predictability, a double fault from Murray helped Nishikori back into the lead.</p> <p>After Nishikori, 40-0 up, steered a simple volley into the net at 4-3 and 40-30, Murray scrambled a break point and took it. The sixth seed was looking nervous for the first time in at least an hour.</p> <p>Nishikori held to stay in the match at 4-5 as Murray\u2019s energy dipped. A weary double fault \u2013 Murray\u2019s third of the match and second of the set \u2013 gave Nishikori his 13th break point in the 11th game \u2013 and he did not waste it, reaching for a miracle save volley to land in the unoccupied court.</p> <p>Nishikori hit his fourth double fault to give Murray hope, trailing 5-6 after nearly four hours. Murray returned long and then Nishikori had two match points. A final dumped backhand ended the agony for the Scot and brought a relieved smile for the Japanese player, who now gives himself a chance of a second shot at the title.</p>",

  "<p>There is a great mystery at the heart of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/jun/14/man-who-fell-to-earth-review\">The Man Who Fell to Earth</a>, Nicolas Roeg\u2019s cult film: its soundtrack. There is a persistent rumour that long-lost music for the film \u2013 recorded by its star David Bowie \u2013 sits somewhere in a vault. There\u2019s only one problem: Bowie\u2019s soundtrack to The Man Who Fell to Earth doesn\u2019t actually exist. The music that appears in the film \u2013 released for the first time next month as part of a collector\u2019s edition by Studio Canal and a vinyl box set by Universal \u2013 was written and produced by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2001/mar/20/guardianobituaries\">John Phillips of the Mamas and the Papas</a>.</p> <p>The never-before-told story of its creation is almost as improbable as Roeg\u2019s film. Signed to both star in and compose an original soundtrack for the film, Bowie, then at the peak of his early fame, intended to record the music once shooting had completed, envisioning it as the follow-up to his album <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jul/22/david-bowie-unreleased-album-box-set-who-can-i-be-now-the-gouster\">Young Americans</a>.

Phillips began to mix the tracks so they could be laid into the edit. At that point, says Goldblatt, \u201csuddenly, he started to go a little peculiar\u201d. He could hear clicks and noises on the tape and, despite the engineer\u2019s insistence that there was nothing there, insisted they do everything over. But the problem persisted. By the fourth or fifth day, things were pretty tense between them. Then something snapped. \u201cHe lost it for some reason,\u201d says Goldblatt, who walked out of the session and returned the next morning to find he\u2019d been replaced by another engineer.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jan/11/david-bowie-man-who-thrilled-the-world-appreciation\">David Bowie: the man who thrilled the world</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Goldblatt was later told that \u201cthe projectionist had gone into the toilets and all he could hear was somebody in the cubicle next to him sniffing \u2013 big sniffs\u201d.

  "<p>Small talk is a fundamental social bonding tool, passed down from our primates, according to <a href=\"https://www.princeton.edu/main/news/archive/S45/01/12S05/index.xml?section=topstories\" rel=\"nofollow\">a study from Princeton University</a>. The researchers have been examining how lemurs use vocalisations, akin to our chit-chat, to build familiarity and closeness. Dubbed \u201cgrooming at arm\u2019s length\u201d, humans do it too. The actual content of the exchange is not the most important part; it is the social function it serves. Small talk can offer a way into business exchanges \u2013 a safety buffer before the hard numbers and negotiation.<br></p> <p>Whether pitching for investment, winning new clients or building contacts, knowing how to connect with others through small talk can be an asset, says career coach and psychologist Salma Shah.</p> <p>Shah says: \u201cDoing business with a person carries risk and lots of unknowns; from a psychological point of view, \u2018good\u2019 small talk \u2013 when we connect with someone \u2013 makes us relax, open up and trust [...] A good conversation creates a feelgood factor and a positive emotional limbic response, which we then associate with that person.\u201d </p> <p>But there are caveats. Small talk can be a segue into big talk; but in the busy world of business, the trick is knowing when \u2013 and when not \u2013 to use it. <br></p> <h2>Use your judgment</h2> <p>Sara Trechman, co-founder of healthy snack food startup <a href=\"http://www.wellandtruly.co.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Well&amp;Truly</a>, secured a meeting with one of the top five supermarkets after a chance chat in a queue for coffee at a Barcelona trade show.</p> <p>Trechman says: \u201cWe talked about how long the queue was taking and places in Spain never having any change \u2013 it turned out she was a buyer for one of the top five supermarkets and it set off a business conversation,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Launched in February by Trechman and her sister-in-law Maria Norrman, Well&amp;Truly has secured listings in Tesco and Whole Foods. \u201cWe\u2019ve found that starting off conversations with small talk allows us to find similarities other than business; it builds an element of common ground,\u201d Trechman says. \u201cAt the same time, you need to be able to read when investors want to get straight to the numbers, without any sort of preamble. When pitching to big supermarkets we know they\u2019re time-poor and have multiple other meetings to get through.\u201d </p> <p>For Well&amp;Truly, small talk has been a part of consolidating business relationships.</p> <h2>Have something worthwhile to say</h2> <p>David Atkinson, managing director of <a href=\"http://theymco.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Yorkshire Meatball Co</a>, likes business transactions to be as simple and straightforward as the meatballs his father-son business makes. \u201cHaving sold and pitched at many levels in my time in small business, I\u2019d say small talk is white noise,\u201d he says. You can begin a meeting with pleasantries, but ultimately people are busy. Atkinson says his approach has always been to know why he is talking to someone and introduce himself as having a solution to their problems.<br></p> <p>\u201cHave something worthwhile to say and make sure you are asking questions, because the more time you\u2019re chit-chatting about the weather, the less time you\u2019re learning about the person you\u2019re trying to sell to,\u201d he says. His approach has worked so far \u2013 the company is set to launch a franchise model across the UK and its products will be on the shelves of four major retailers in the coming months.<br></p> <h2>Consider the context</h2> <p>Evidently, context is everything. And so is recognising that some people do not like small talk. \u201cAlways take a steer from your potential customer if you are trying to win new business,\u201d says Shah. \u201cIf they open with small talk, then do keep it going and go at their pace.\u201d Equally, if you are with someone who just wants to keep things business only, Shah suggests mirroring their style. \u201cThis will make them feel comfortable and receptive to what you have to offer.\u201d </p> <p>Aadil Seedat, launched Greater Manchester-based <a href=\"http://www.umbrella-host.co.uk\" rel=\"nofollow\">Umbrella Host</a>, a cloud computing service, three years ago. He says throwing in the odd cheesy joke or industry pun has won him contacts and business from his target audience \u2013 web developers. \u201cThey\u2019re generally not very formal and enjoy a good laugh [...] But when delving down into figures I tend to avoid small talk because that\u2019s the time you provide your serious commercial skills and experience.\u201d <br></p> <h2>Do your research</h2> <p>Asking open-ended questions is a great way to build rapport and establish common ground, says <a href=\"https://executive-coaching.co.uk/meet-the-team/geraldine-gallacher/\" rel=\"nofollow\">executive coach Geraldine Gallagher</a>. \u201cIf I\u2019m at an event I\u2019ll ask the person why they\u2019ve come along or what they have thought of the panels so far; go into curious-mode and learn about the people you\u2019re talking to,\u201d she says. Don\u2019t overcomplicate things by going into a state of hyper-analysis which prevents you from being natural. And use your own boredom threshold as a marker of when to cut to the chase, or move on. \u201cLet\u2019s face it, small talk can be boring, and if you\u2019re bored, they\u2019re definitely bored too.\u201d </p> <p>If you are going to a business meeting, know who will be in the room and what they do by researching their backgrounds beforehand. \u201cLinkedIn is a great tool for establishing whether there is professional common ground you can mention,\u201d says Gallagher. </p> <p>She suggests some stock questions you can try: \u201cAsking about the environment you\u2019re in is a good one, especially if it\u2019s an interesting building\u201d. What is going on in the news is another solid option, as long as you aren\u2019t drawn into anything too political or religion-based. And don\u2019t make the mistake of assuming the person who brings you up to the meeting is an assistant or secretary \u2013 they could be the one running the show once you get into the boardroom \u2013 so use the elevator ride up there to build some rapport and glean information.<br></p> <p>But don\u2019t overdo it. \u201cIf you make too much small talk it can detract from your gravitas and make it sound like you\u2019re babbling,\u201d says Gallagher. Nobody wants to hear about your nightmare journey down the M6 in minute detail. </p> <p>Ultimately, remember why you\u2019re there, and make sure you get across what it is you can do for the person in front of you.<br></p> <p><strong>Sign up to become a member of the Guardian Small Business Network </strong><a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/small-business/\"><strong>here</strong></a><strong> for more advice, insight and best practice direct to your inbox.</strong></p>",
  "<p>What separates us from the other animals? The list of proposed answers is as long as your arm: rationality; cooking; religion; pointless games; making stuff; and so forth. But one popular answer has always been our power of language. The exact process by which we acquired it is mysterious. So here is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/tomwolfe\">Tom Wolfe</a> to tell us why everyone to date has got it wrong.</p> <p>The book tells the story of two little guys up against two establishment bullies. The hard-grafting <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2013/jan/20/alfred-russel-wallace-forgotten-man-evolution\">Alfred Russel Wallace</a>, who independently co-discovered the principle of evolution by natural selection, didn\u2019t stand a chance against <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/charles-darwin\">Charles Darwin</a>, who enjoyed \u201cthe eternally Daddy-paid-for life of a British Gentleman\u201d. Darwin imagined his theory could explain everything, but Wallace eventually decided that it couldn\u2019t explain language, which must after all have been God-given.</p> <p>A century later comes <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/noam-chomsky\">Noam Chomsky</a>, revolutionising linguistics by suggesting that humans have an innate (therefore evolved) capacity to acquire languages: a built-in \u201cdeep grammar\u201d or \u201cuniversal grammar\u201d or \u201clanguage acquisition device\u201d which explains, for example, how toddlers can easily construct novel well-formed sentences. (See also Steven Pinker\u2019s <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/language-instinct.html\"><em>The Language Instinct</em></a>.) \u201cNothing about Chomsky\u2019s charisma was elegant,\u201d Wolfe complains, perhaps wishing the object of his abuse had worn a white suit, and yet, he says, Chomsky ruthlessly dominated the field. Until, that is, a plucky, outdoorsy underdog called Daniel Everett spent some time with an Amazon tribe called the Pirah\u00e3 and reported that their language lacks a certain feature (recursion, or nesting of ideas) that Chomsky had suggested might be universal, and so proved Chomsky wrong. The smoke cleared and the origin of language remained as elusive as ever.</p> <p>Wolfe tells these stories with the kind of free-wheeling vim familiar from his brilliant books such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/mar/14/100-best-nonfiction-no-7-right-stuff-tom-wolfe\"><em>The Right Stuff</em></a><em> </em>and <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/bonfire-of-the-vanities-3.html\"><em>The Bonfire of the Vanities</em></a>. Particularly in the way he ventriloquises the thoughts and worries of his protagonists, the book is superbly written, when it doesn\u2019t tip over into a kind of self-parodic babble. (Darwin, we are assured, \u201cwas also a slick operator \u2026 smooth \u2026 smooth \u2026 smooth and then some\u201d.) The only problem with Wolfe\u2019s tales, really, is that they are irresponsibly partial accounts, riddled with elementary falsehoods.</p> <p>Wolfe insists, for example, that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/charles-darwin\">Darwin</a> had no \u201cevidence\u201d for his theory of evolution by natural selection; in fact, as is well known, he adduced a lot of evidence at the time, including the geographical distribution of species, comparative anatomy, fossils and the existence of vestigial organs. Today, of course, evolution is observed in real time in the laboratory, among microbes or insects, a fact that Wolfe either doesn\u2019t know or is mysteriously careful not to mention. Meanwhile, the argument between Chomsky and Everett is much more controversial than he allows. (Others point out that even if the Pirah\u00e3 have no recursion in their language, which some deny, they are easily able to learn Portuguese, which does have it.) And in any case, some version, at least, of the idea of a \u201clanguage centre\u201d in the brain is now uncontroversial \u2013 not in the sense of a uniquely dedicated physical sub-organ, because that is not how the brain works, but certainly in the form of specialised neuronal \u201ccircuits\u201d that are predictably active during language processing.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Wolfe tells his stories with the kind of free-wheeling vim familiar from The Right Stuff and The Bonfire of the Vanities</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><em>The Kingdom of Speech</em>, then, is a sad example of the interface of literary celebrity with publishing. An author less famous and bankable than Wolfe would surely have been saved from such embarrassment by more critical editorial attention. Even a cursory fact\u2011check could still have prevented howlers such as the statement that \u201cEinstein discovered the speed of light\u201d (no he didn\u2019t). Wolfe has insisted that he is an atheist rather than a creationist (though this book has of course been welcomed with open arms by the creationist American \u201cintelligent design\u201d movement), and we may as well take him at his word. He is not making a crypto-religious argument; he just hasn\u2019t researched his subject properly.</p> <p>Never mind facts. The USP of this book, finally, is that Wolfe himself, just by thinking about it a bit, has single-handedly solved the problem that \u201chas left endless generations of academics, certified geniuses, utterly baffled\u201d. He alone knows how language arose. Darwin\u2019s own guesses \u2013 the imitation of animal sounds, for example \u2013 were, Wolfe scornfully writes, just that: guesses, or \u201cJust So stories\u201d. But Wolfe has the one true answer. What is it? Er, that humans invented language as a mnemonic device, to help remember things. (He doesn\u2019t explain this very clearly, but I think I was supposed to imagine a caveman trying to remember to bring another rock indoors and grunting \u201cRock!\u201d as an aide-memoire.) This, of course, is no better a Just So story than any of Darwin\u2019s. As it happens, though Wolfe doesn\u2019t mention it, the ancient Epicureans already thought much the same thing, considering that animals \u201clabelled\u201d parts of the world with particular honks and squawks, and humans just developed the habit further.</p> <p>But now we know what the Epicureans didn\u2019t and Wolfe still apparently doesn\u2019t: that the brain is an evolved organ, or that the human larynx evolved into a shape very different from the larynxes of our closest primate cousins, enabling us to make speech-noises they can\u2019t. We still don\u2019t know precisely how it happened and may never do, but it is obvious to everyone that speech must have evolved \u2013 to everyone, that is, except those who are congenitally suspicious of scientific authority, and perhaps especially those professional super-users of language who feel forlorn at the prospect of their life-defining power being demystified by geeks.</p> <p>\u2022 To order <em>The Kingdom of Speech</em> for \u00a312.29 go to <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/kingdom-of-speech.html?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\">bookshop.theguardian.com</a> or call 0330 333 6846.

  "<p>New waterproof series 2 Apple Watches are coming by the end of this month, the company announced at its autumn iPhone 7 launch event in San Francisco.</p> <p>Apple\u2019s smartwatch line is getting its first hardware update since it was launched in April 2015, gaining improved components including a new, longer-lasting battery and waterproofing to 50m - deeper than most other smartwatches - to track swimming and other water-based sports.</p> <p>The Watch, which comes in two different sizes across a range of different costs and colours, will gain a built-in GPS chip to remove the need to carry an iPhone to accurately track distance during runs, walks and other sports.</p> <p>Jeff Williams, chief operating officer for Apple said: \u201cApple Watch series 2 has been completely re-engineered. Apple Watch series 2 is swim proof, it\u2019ll change how you use the watch. </p> <p>\u201cYou can wear it whether you\u2019re swimming, surfing or just doing the occasional cannon ball.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5bda85ef3e8896f3737717dda9dd280727867640\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5bda85ef3e8896f3737717dda9dd280727867640/0_0_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jeff Williams discusses the Apple Watch Series 2 during a media event in San Francisco.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jeff Williams discusses the Apple Watch Series 2 during a media event in San Francisco.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Beck Diefenbach/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Apple has also looked to address one of the most common complaints of the original watch: speed. Its new processor is 50% faster than the old version and has twice the graphics performance, while its new watchOS 3 operating system will be able to do more without being tethered to an iPhone.</p> <p>The company showed off various new apps, including Pok\u00e9mon Go for the Apple Watch, which will take eyes off screens and allow users to go about their day and still play. The game will be available by the end of the year.</p> <p>The outside of the Watch, including the pillow-shaped body, digital crown and square screen remain largely untouched, remaining compatible Apple\u2019s myriad exchangeable straps.</p> <p>Apple has improved the screen, making twice as bright at 1,000nits, which the company says will make reading the watch outside a lot easier.</p> <p>Users hoping for a watch that doesn\u2019t need to be paired to their phone for everyday use will be disappointed, as the new device still lacks the GSM radio that would be necessary for connecting to mobile phone networks. The Apple Watch still replies on a Bluetooth connection to the iPhone or Wi-Fi.</p> <p>The Apple Watch series 2 is available in aluminium, stainless steel and a new white ceramic material that the company says is four times stronger than stainless steel.</p> <p>Apple has also partnered with Herm\u00e8s for a special edition, and sports company Nike for the Apple Watch Nike+ aimed at runners. Apple and Nike have had various partnerships over the last decade since the launch of the Nike+ for the iPod.</p> <p>There was no mention of Apple\u2019s super-expensive \u201cEdition\u201d line of solid gold watches.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a2a08183362a97acdf7da368b19ce7258df95398\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a2a08183362a97acdf7da368b19ce7258df95398/0_162_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Trevor Edwards, President of Nike Brand, discusses the Apple Watch.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Trevor Edwards, President of Nike Brand, discusses the Apple Watch.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Beck Diefenbach/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Apple Watch series 2 and Apple Watch Nike+ will cost $369.

Apple\u2019s watchOS 3.0 promises a total overhaul of the watch\u2019s features, including the ability to keep certain apps open in the background, removing the need for a confusing distinction between \u201capps\u201d and \u201cglances\u201d. It also offers a Minnie Mouse watch face.</p> <p>For Apple, the new Watch is hoped to reignite sales that have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/sep/07/apple-watch-tech-wearables-market\">tumbled by 55% in the second quarter of this year</a>, according to data from IDC. While Apple has not released sales numbers for the Watch, analysts estimate shipments in the first 12 months to be in the 12m range, making it the biggest selling smartwatch.</p> <p>But where smartphones killed off competing devices such as PDAs, compact cameras and music players, subsuming their functions, the smartwatch has yet to do the same to fitness trackers and other wearable devices. Shipments of the so-called basic wearables made by Fitbit and others in the second quarter have grown by 49% in the same period smartwatches have fallen by 27%.</p> <p>Apple\u2019s pitch with the new Apple Watch is broadly the same as the first generation device, focusing on notifications, controls and health and fitness functions \u2013 the bread and butter of Fitbits the world over.

  "<p>Apple signed the death warrant for the headphone port on Wednesday, ushering in what it hopes is a tangle-free era of wireless listening. But the move is a bold one for Apple, and one that <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/sections/alltechconsidered/2016/09/06/492876197/apple-may-test-iphone-users-loyalty-if-it-dumps-the-headphone-jack\">tech pundits predict</a> could repel consumers. </p> <p>The world\u2019s biggest tech company had been widely expected to kill off the headphone jack at the a launch of the iPhone 7 in San Francisco. The 138-year-old technology will be replaced by headsets that plug into the device\u2019s Lightning connector, which is also used for charging. </p> <p>The change allowed Apple to make the new iPhone slimmer and waterproof. Unusually for Apple, notorious for its tight control on its PR, the iPhone\u2019s details leaked briefly just before the presentation by way of Amazon.com, which posted its page of iPhone 7 accessories including specs on the phone, and by Apple tweets that appear to have gone out ahead of plans. The presentation lacked Apple\u2019s traditional \u201cone more thing\u201d at the end and did not include news about Apple\u2019s lines of computers or tablets. Shares were down 0.23% from the beginning of the day to the end of the presentation.</p> <p>While consumers will be able to use their old headphones via an adapter, which will come with the new phone, or plug in a new set, the ultimate aim may be to push consumers to snip those tangle-prone wires altogether for a wireless headset \u2013 preferably one made by Beats, the company Apple bought for $3bn in 2014.<br></p> <p>The latest iPhone launch is crucial for Apple, which has seen <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jul/26/apple-earnings-pokemon-go-augmented-reality-steve-cook\">sales of the device slip</a> amid ever fiercer competition.

According to the United Nations, up to 90% of the world\u2019s electronic waste is illegally traded or dumped each year.\u201d</p> <p>But Apple has a strong technological case for updating the headphone jack, which can trace its origins back to at least 1878 and was originally used in old-fashioned telephone switchboards. <br></p> <p>Apple announced another new product on Wednesday \u2013 AirPods, a pair of earplug-sized headphones that Schiller said use a new kind of chip to deliver a \u201cmagical experience\u201d without the usual hassle of BlueTooth pairing and unpairing.</p> <p>The company also added features to its camera system, which now includes two front-facing lenses that allow true telephoto zoom \u2013 instead of simply picture-enlargement \u2013 and new workarounds for low-light photography and other perks.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/video/2016/sep/07/tim-cook-james-corden-carpool-karaoke-apple-event-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/523gp\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2699215\"            data-video-name=\"Tim Cook carpools with James Corden on way to Apple event \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"The Late Late Show with James Corden/CBS\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57d05cb9e4b0c1d95ae1457a\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/09/07/160907applecorden_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/09/07/160907applecorden_WebM.webm\"/><source src=\"http://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11850628&amp;format=video/m3u8\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/video/2016/sep/07/tim-cook-james-corden-carpool-karaoke-apple-event-video\">Tim Cook carpools with James Corden on way to Apple event</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>The headphone gambit emphasizes a growing concern among shareholders: that Apple has become a one-product company. Data from an analysis by eMarketer indicates the company\u2019s share of the US smartphone market is expected to remain essentially static this year at about 43.5%, up just 0.2%. </p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s an unrealistic expectation that they\u2019re going to continue to grow at the same rates that they have in the past,\u201d Ask, of Forrest Research, said.</p> <p>Apple continues to market its products as premium and high end, but there are a limited number of wealthy tech consumers, and competitors are gaining traction in the developing world with economical models. \u201cThey\u2019re not trying to win the race to the bottom like [competitors] Samsung or Huawei; they tend to go after the middle-class consumer that can afford the products,\u201d Ask said.</p> <p>The tech firm doubled down on the Apple Watch, which debuted in a Series 2 version with tie-ins from Nike and Hermes. Apple still hasn\u2019t broken out sales figures for the watch in its earnings reports, preferring to include it in a line item with sundry other products. The new version will be waterproof.</p> <p>The presentation\u2019s biggest surprise came from Mario creator Shigeru Miyamoto, who showed up to announce <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/sep/07/iphone-7-launch-nintendo-super-mario-run-game\">Super Mario Run</a>, a brand-new game in the Mario Bros franchise for iOS devices and one of the very few to debut on a platform not made by Nintendo.

  "<p>When the time came for my family\u2019s first ever multi-day cycle tour, the Devon coast-to-coast ticked all the boxes. The <a href=\"http://www.exploredevon.info/activities/cycle/devon-coast-coast-ncn27\">102-mile route</a>, from Ilfracombe in the north to Plymouth in the south, is 70% traffic-free and passes through some beautiful landscapes. </p> <p>We began in Barnstaple, rolling along the salt marshes of the river Torridge, up to Dartmoor and down thegorges of the Plym valley. The gradients are gentle as the route follows the path of a series of disused railway lines. I soon realised the easy riding belied the huge challenges of turning a series of abandoned railway lines into a world-class cycling and walking trail.</p> <p>In the 1960s the Beeching cuts to branch lines reduced Britain\u2019s rail network by a third and bequeathed the country a ready-made rural cycling and walking network. The hard work - building embankments, bridges, viaducts, cuttings and tunnels - had already been done. All that was needed was a layer of tarmac. But unlike in the United States, where Congress passed a law to allow <a href=\"http://www.railstotrails.org/build-trails/trail-building-toolbox/railbanking/\">\u201crailbanking\u201d</a> of disused lines for future use, Britain\u2019s old lines were sold off or given away. </p> <p>\u201cSelling off the land was incredibly shortsighted,\u201d says Graham Cornish, who has led the work on Devon council\u2019s rural cycling network for the past 20 years. \u201cBut back then transport policy was all about the car and nobody saw the potential for cycle routes.\u201d </p> <p>Devon began building rural cycleways as a way of bringing tourists to less visited parts of the county. But the task of reassembling even just a few miles of track is painfully slow and beset by legal, political and technical challenges. It begins with finding out who owns the land and whether they\u2019re willing to sell or lease it to the council. </p> <p>\u201cI go for the easy targets first and leave the hardest until last,\u201d says Cornish. \u201cI\u2019ve had landowners who\u2019ve said \u2018the only way you\u2019ll build a cycle path here is over my dead body\u2019. And I\u2019ve thought, \u2018Well, okay\u2019. If you wait around they usually do die, though I\u2019ve got a few that are still clinging on.\u201d </p> <p>Cornish keeps his land deals secret so other landowners don\u2019t cotton on to the bigger plan and start holding out for higher prices. He describes a \u201cpincer movement\u201d of land acquisition which builds the case for tackling the trickiest section. </p> <p>One example is the steep-sided Walkham valley near Grenofen. Here, the old railway once leapt the gorge on a huge 15-span, 40-metre high viaduct designed by Isambard Kingdom Brunel. After the railway closed the bridge was demolished and for years a long, steep detour put most people off riding the route. In 2012 the spectacular Gem bridge was built at a cost of \u00a32.1m, part-funded with EU regional aid. </p> <p>Funding is a perennial problem for rail-to-trail projects. Devon council\u2019s highways officer, Ian James, explained that proper preparation is essential.</p> <p>\u201cYou have to get as much as you can sorted out beforehand and then wait for a funding window to open. That means having a strategic plan, acquiring as much land as you can, securing the permissions in advance and even lining up the contractors who\u2019ll build it. We\u2019ve got very good at that here in Devon. If you\u2019re coming at it from a standing start, you\u2019ve got no chance.\u201d</p> <p>In many ways what Cornish and his colleagues have done is heroic. It\u2019s rare to encounter such an can-do approach from a local authority, especially in relation to cycling, which so often sees projects dropped at the first sign of difficulty. </p> <p>Where Devon has built it, people have come, in their droves. Each year an estimated million people use the Tarka trail, half a million use the Exe estuary trail. Increased visitor numbers have saved struggling pubs along the routes and inspired new businesses. Early successes like the Tarka trail have convinced council chiefs <a href=\"http://democracy.devon.gov.uk/Data/North%20Devon%20Highways%20and%20Traffic%20Orders%20Committee/20150421/Agenda/supplementary%20information-PTE-15-22.pdf\">to back more projects</a> and won over many landowners and local residents.</p> <p>Yet even in Devon it seems as though new cycle routes are developed piecemeal and at a painfully slow pace. The Devon coast-to-coast route took three decades to build and even now there are a some significant gaps. With rail-to-trail projects up and down the country proving their worth for tourism and recreation, transport and health, there\u2019s a strong case for a faster pace and a firmer strategic direction from central government. </p> <p>Without any national policy on rails-to-trails, it\u2019s left to volunteers to start campaigns to get their local authorities to take an interest in projects and they must then wait for funding from central government. It\u2019s not a recipe for success. Among current rail-to-trail campaigns are <a href=\"http://www.wyevalleycycling.org.uk/\">a new link between Chepstow and Tintern in the Wye valley</a>; the completion of the <a href=\"http://www.thestrawberryline.org.uk/index.php?section=campaign\">Strawberry line between Clevedon and Shepton Mallet</a> and the <a href=\"http://ottertrail.org/\">Otter Trail in east Devon</a>; new links <a href=\"http://highworthmissinglink.org.uk/\">between Swindon and Highworth in Wiltshire</a>, between <a href=\"http://www.east-northamptonshire.gov.uk/info/200096/tourism_and_travel/786/east_northamptonshire_greenway\">Usk and Pontypool in Monmouthshire and between Peterborough and Wellingborough in Northamptonshire</a> and between <a href=\"http://www.fromesmissinglink.org.uk/\">Frome and Radstock</a> in Somerset.

We bought the property for \u00a3235,000 and it\u2019s now worth about \u00a3250,000. The outstanding mortgage is approximately \u00a3196,000 and we are tied into a two-year deal that expires in March 2017 and therefore have an early repayment charge of \u00a36,000.<br tabindex=\"-1\"><br tabindex=\"-1\"> How do I calculate how much it would cost to buy my partner out of the property? Who should pay ongoing housing costs such as home insurance and repairs until we\u2019ve sorted out what should happen? Can the early repayment charge be taken into account? Do I have to appoint a solicitor or can I just agree terms with my partner?</p> <p>I am worried if I take on additional costs I won\u2019t be able to even consider buying him out.</p> <p><strong>A </strong>To be able to buy out your partner, you need to be able to take over his half of the mortgage and pay him cash for his half of the equity in the property. </p> <p> If the house is worth \u00a3250,000 and the mortgage is \u00a3196,000, your joint equity is \u00a354,000 so you would need to pay him half of that, which is \u00a327,000. If you don\u2019t have that much spare cash, one option would be to increase the mortgage to \u00a3223,000 (\u00a3196,000 plus \u00a327,000). However, you won\u2019t be able to take over the mortgage and/or increase it to raise the cash to pay your partner without the agreement of your lender, who will need to be convinced that you are able to afford the mortgage on your own. </p> <p>Your lender will also be able to tell you if taking the whole mortgage \u2013 or increasing it \u2013 would trigger the early repayment charge. I can\u2019t see why it would as by taking on the mortgage, you are not repaying it early, but it makes sense to double-check. If you would have to pay the fee, it also makes sense to wait until after March to make any changes to the mortgage. If your lender won\u2019t let you put the mortgage in your sole name, you will have to sell the property. If you sold before March, the early-repayment fee would have to be paid and it would come out of the sale proceeds.</p> <p>As far as ongoing costs are concerned, it seems fair that you and your partner should split the cost of anything that directly affects the property such as repairs and building insurance, which protects the property in case of damage. However, it doesn\u2019t seem fair to ask him to pay half of the contents\u2019 insurance, for example, unless his belongings are still in the house.</p> <p>Finally, you don\u2019t need to use a solicitor to agree terms with your partner, but you will need one to deal with either the transfer of the property to your sole ownership or, if that\u2019s not going to be possible, the sale of the house.</p>",
  "<p>When Alex Guest got a job at a digital consultancy, he decided to customise it so he could do more of the work he likes, less of what he doesn\u2019t.</p> <p>\u201cI was hired as a pay-per-click manager,\u201d says Guest, who has worked for Prodo Digital for four years. \u201cHowever, I didn\u2019t stick to what it said on my job description. I realised there may be other, better ways to improve our clients\u2019 bottom line than the ones I was doing. These also would benefit the company and mean my tasks at work were more enjoyable.\u201d<br></p> <p>Before the 31-year-old could ask for a change in duties, Guest made use of any free online resources he could find to develop his knowledge and skills. He took online courses in the evenings, signed up for webinars at lunch and engaged with industry leaders on social media.<br></p> <p>\u201cI also learned about how other people had evolved their roles at work and broken out of their job descriptions,\u201d says Guest.<br></p> <p>After 12 months, he approached his manager, who was supportive, and Guest significantly changed his role. It\u2019s a process which he\u2019s continued, and which has led him to becoming the head of training and insights.<br></p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Companies should hire high-performing people with minimal job descriptions and let them adapt their own roles.</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Allowing employees to customise their own job descriptions in this way is an approach that can work well for employers not just employees, according to recent research. <a href=\"https://www.mgmt.ucl.ac.uk/news/fully-defined-job-descriptions-are-outdated\">A study by the UCL School of Management</a> suggests that teams are more successful when employees are able to find and claim components of their roles that are useful, and drop the others.<br></p> <p>In fact the research suggests that to successfully innovate, companies should hire high-performing people with minimal job descriptions and let them adapt their own roles. It is a move away from the conventional way of hiring. </p> <p>\u201cPeople used to be recruited into a specific role and they\u2019d expect to do it for a defined period of, say, five to 10 years,\u201d says Neil Morrison, group HR director for Penguin Random House. \u201cNow, we recruit talented self-learners, people who are as adaptable, curious and creative as the industry we\u2019re in. We know that they\u2019ll come in and do one job, which then morphs into something else, so we\u2019re thinking differently about how we recruit them in the first place.\u201d <br></p> <p>Morrison points out that the company drops traditional requirements such as a degree qualification to hire the right people. However, there can be risks to this approach.<br></p> <p>\u201cWithout the structure of a job description, an employer can sometimes find that an employee will resist certain essential tasks. Equally, an employee may find that the role is not the one sold to them at interview,\u201d says Alison Treliving, labour and employment partner at law firm Squire Patton Boggs.<br></p> <p>Generally speaking though, unless you or your employer substantially changes your role, you won\u2019t need to get the changes in writing (in your contract, for example). \u201cIf you want to renegotiate your tasks, you can do this at your annual appraisal,\u201d says Sajida Hussain, employment lawyer at DAC Beachcroft. \u201cIt\u2019s a good time to explain why you want to make changes and if you need further training, present the business case for it.\u201d<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/careers/2016/may/31/change-jobs-risks-dead-end-take-career-happiness\">Why we don't change jobs enough \u2013 and why we should</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Before you do that, it helps if you have some connections. Networking internally helped 35-year-old Lisa Haycox, the operations manager of Explore Learning, to get the role she wanted. She began working for the company as a tutor in 2002. </p> <p>\u201cTo change my role, I learned from my peers,\u201d says Haycox. \u201cI looked at what my colleagues were doing and asked if I could spend an hour or so with them. I then had the insights I needed to build up my own skills and approach my manager to ask to do some different tasks myself.\u201d<br></p> <p>Internal networking is a useful way of raising your profile, says Kate Griffiths-Lambeth, director of human resources at wealth manager Charles Stanley. \u201cWe\u2019ve had an employee who asked the chief executive for mentorship, for example,\u201d she said. \u201cParticipating in company-wide initiatives, such as charitable fundraising, is another way to make connections, demonstrate your interpersonal skills and show you are an asset to your employer.\u201d<br></p> <p>This could even lead to your dream job. Car enthusiast Oliver Taylor, for example, was taken on by BP as a graduate in 2007. He went from working in the research department in a junior role to becoming a chief engineer in the innovation department.<br></p> <p>\u201cFrom the start I was allowed to shape the direction of my research,\u201d says Taylor. \u201cThe relationships I built with senior members of staff across the company meant I could showcase my skills and demonstrate that I was able to take on this new role.\u201d<br></p> <p><strong>Looking for a job?

donations from the system but he flagged it was a complex area, because of the implied freedom of political communication. \u201cWe do have big legal issues and some constitutional issues,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The prime minister said any overhaul of the donations and disclosure system would also have to take into account activism by groups outside the formal political system.</p> <p>\u201cIn many respects what we\u2019ve seen is an evolution in political campaigning, where, particularly on the Labor side, the Labor party itself has become, in many respects, just a brand, and the real players in the election campaign have been trade unions and organisations like GetUp for example,\u201d Turnbull said Thursday.</p> <p>\u201cIf you pass a law that affects donations to political parties that does not address the full range of financial involvement in the political contest, then you may actually be achieving very little indeed.\u201d</p> <p>The Coalition has been spooked during the most recent federal election <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/jul/06/election-2016-cory-bernardi-liberals-labor-volunteer-army\">by the extensive field operation</a> rolled out by Labor, the trade union movement and also the marginal seats campaign sorties of GetUp, which are said to have had a significant impact in states like Tasmania, where the

senator Cory Bernardi <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/jul/06/cory-bernardi-establishes-rightwing-movement-australian-conservatives\">has talked of building up a new grassroots conservative movement</a> to counter some of the ground advances seen over recent electoral cycles by progressive political parties and activist groups.</p> <p>On Thursday, Bernardi said he would not be concerned if a group such as Australian Conservatives faced curbs on its grassroots activism during election campaigns.</p> <p>There is some talk in Coalition circles about a Canadian provision that restricts campaigns by third-party groups during election seasons.</p> <p>Under electoral law in Canada, third-party activist groups are permitted to spend what they like on advertising before the start of an election campaign but, once the writs are issued, spending is capped, which works to limit the influence of these groups.</p> <p>Canadian activist groups have to register once they have run up election advertising expenses over $500 and the campaigns have to clearly identify the activist group and the state that has authorised the expenditure.</p> <p>Labor has signalled it would support a ban on foreign donations, continuous disclosure of donations, lower thresholds at which donations are publicly declared, an end to donation splitting and an increase in public funding.</p> <p>Even though the trade union movement in contemporary times runs an independent field campaign, donates to parties other than the ALP and provides campaign infrastructure to support crossbench candidates, Labor is highly unlikely to support changes that would limit its institutional funding through trade union donations.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link

Too often, staff had their roles diminished for speaking up about their mental health concerns, which wasn\u2019t always what the employee wanted, he said.</p> <p>Workplace representatives were asked by MinterEllison about how mental health issues were handled by managers, about policies and programs available to help workers manage their mental health, and about what more they believed could be done to support the management of mental health in their workplace.</p> <p>Of 226 responses received across a range of industries, 74% of the respondents reported there was no formal mental health management policy. This was despite 81.3% of respondents reporting that they spent about one quarter of their time managing staff with mental health issues. One third of respondents said more than 15 staff members at their company had come to them with mental health issues in the past year.</p> <p>While 56% of participants reported they were seeing more cases compared with the previous 12 months, only 38% of the organisations said staff mental health had been discussed at a board level. Most respondents said their organisation made no or little investment in mental health and wellbeing programs.</p> <p>\u201cIt is clear the increased incidence of mental health issues in workplaces is affecting the performance of organisations and increasingly occupying the time of management,\u201d the report found.</p> <p>The three most common strategies reported by organisations to support the mental health of staff were access to a confidential employee assistance program, flexible work arrangements, and providing access to mental health information. But the impact and effectiveness of these strategies was not often measured by most of the workplaces.</p> <p>\u201cOur survey results reveal that, over the past two years, the two most common mental health issues affecting staff are depression and anxiety (94%),\u201d the report found.</p> <p>\u201cQuite unexpectedly, 44% of participants reported suicide or attempted suicide at their workplaces in the last two years.\u201d</p> <p>According to Heads Up, a partnership between the Mentally Healthy Workplace Alliance and beyondblue, untreated mental health conditions cost Australian employers $10.9bn every year through absenteeism, reduced productivity and compensation claims. <a href=\"http://www.blackdoginstitute.org.au/docs/BDIWorkplaceTrainingBrochure.pdf\">Other research has found</a> that every dollar spent on effective mental health procedures returns an average of $2.30 in benefits to an organisation.</p> <p>Unaddressed, the organisations said poor workplace mental health led to low morale and staff engagement, high staff turnover and potential penalties for breaches of work health and safety legislation.</p> <p>Associate Prof Samuel Harvey, a psychiatrist with the Black Dog Institute who runs the workplace mental health research program at the school of psychiatry, University of New South Wales, said it was not enough for a workplace to provide a phone number for an employee counselling program.</p> <p>\u201cGood workplaces now create a suite of interventions, from prevention through to recovery, and they do it because it\u2019s right and because economic analyses show it makes good business sense,\u201d he said.</p>",

Why are we not disarming the Japanese? We desire the definition of government policy regarding the presence of British troops in Indo-China.\u201d The letter was signed by the \u201cBritish other ranks\u201d of the signal section of an infantry brigade based in Saigon.</p> <p>It was highly unusual \u2013 notwithstanding the egalitarian spirit of those postwar days \u2013 to see a group of low-ranking British troops so publicly demanding that the foreign secretary explain his government\u2019s policies. But what was truly extraordinary was the disclosure that British troops were fighting in the former French colony against the local population, and that they were doing so alongside their former enemies: the Japanese army and the Vichy French.</p> <p>Few members of the public were aware that the British government had been so anxious to see the French recover control of their prewar colonial possession that the entire 20th Infantry Division of the British Indian Army had been airlifted into the country the previous August, with orders to suppress the Vietnamese people\u2019s attempts to form their own government. There were almost 26,000 men with 2,500 vehicles, including armoured cars. Three British artillery regiments had also been dispatched, the RAF had flown in with 14 Spitfires and 34 Mosquito fighter-bombers, and there was a 140-strong contingent from the Royal Navy.</p> <p>On landing, the British had rearmed the Vichy troops with new .303 British rifles. Shortly afterwards, surrendered Japanese troops had also been rearmed and compelled to fight the Vietnamese \u2013 some under the command of British officers.</p> <p>The British were operating in accordance with an order that they should show a ruthless disregard for civilians, who, consequently, were killed and maimed in large numbers. \u201cThere is no front in these operations,\u201d the order said. \u201cWe may find it difficult to distinguish friend from foe. Always use the maximum force available to ensure wiping out any hostilities we may meet. If one uses too much force, no harm is done. If one uses too small a force, and it has to be extricated, we will suffer casualties and encourage the enemy.\u201d</p> <p>Many of the troops who were expected to act on such orders were appalled. One of the signatories to the letter to Bevin was Dick Hartmann, a 31-year-old soldier from Manchester. Hartmann later recalled: \u201cWe saw homes being burned and hundreds of the local population being kept in compounds. We saw many ambulances, open at the back, carrying mainly \u2013 actually, totally \u2013 women and children, who were in bandages. I remember it very vividly. All the women and children who lived there would stand outside their homes, all dressed in black, and just grimly stare at us, really with \u2026 hatred.\u201d</p> <p>Back in the UK, parliament and the public knew next to nothing about this war, the manner in which it was being waged, or Britain\u2019s role in it.<strong> </strong>And it appears that the cabinet and the War Office wished their state of ignorance be preserved.</p> <p>At the Allies\u2019 south-east Asia headquarters in Ceylon, however, and at the War Office in London, British commanders and senior defence officials were enraged by the letter. Hartmann and his comrades were warned that a brigadier was coming to see them.</p> <aside class=\"element element-membership\"> <p> <span>Membership Event: </span><a href=\"https://membership.theguardian.com/event/the-long-read-live-at-the-hospital-club-27192843527\">The Long Read live - at the Hospital Club</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cHe just came in one morning and gave us a haranguing about the evils of our ways. He said a few years before we would have been shot, but unfortunately he couldn\u2019t do that now.\u201d Hartmann was worried. But some of his comrades had many years of jungle combat behind them and were unimpressed by the brigadier and his bluster. They told him, bluntly, that they believed Britain\u2019s cause in the country to be unjust, and that he should make himself scarce. The brigadier turned on his heel, and did just that.</p> <p>But there were no more letters from Saigon, there was little press attention, and almost no comments were made in the Commons. Despite the size of its military commitment to Indochina, this was to be a British military operation that would be kept out of sight, and largely out of mind. And it would not be the last such campaign.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p><strong>Almost 70 years later, in September 2014,</strong> David Cameron, the British prime minister, gave a statement in which he prepared the country for the resumption of military action in Iraq, this time against Islamic State forces. \u201cWe are a peaceful people,\u201d Cameron said, standing in front of two union jack flags. \u201cWe do not seek out confrontation, but we need to understand we cannot ignore this threat to our security \u2026 we cannot just walk on by if we are to keep this country safe. We have to confront this menace.\u201d</p> <p>Nobody doubted that the prime minister was under pressure to act after Islamic State had filmed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/13/isis-video-david-haines-beheading\">the brutal murder of a British aid worker</a> and threatened <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/oct/03/alan-henning-isis-syria-video-murder\">the slaughter of a second</a>. Moreover, nobody disputed his assertion that the British are \u201ca peaceful people\u201d who do not seek confrontation.</p> <p>In fact, between 1918 and 1939, British forces were fighting in Iraq, Sudan, Ireland, Palestine and Aden. In the years after the second world war, British servicemen were fighting in Eritrea, Palestine, French Indochina, Dutch East Indies, Malaya, Egypt, China and Oman. Between 1949 and 1970, the British initiated 34 foreign military interventions. Later came the Falklands, Iraq \u2013 four times \u2013 Bosnia, Kosovo, Sierra Leone, Afghanistan, Libya and, of course, Operation Banner, the British army\u2019s 38-year deployment to Northern Ireland.</p> <p>For more than a hundred years, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/ng-interactive/2014/feb/11/britain-100-years-of-conflict\">not a single year has passed</a> when Britain\u2019s armed forces have not been engaged in military operations somewhere in the world. The British are unique in this respect: the same could not be said of the Americans, the Russians, the French or any other nation.</p> <p>Only the British are perpetually at war.</p> <p>One reason that this is rarely acknowledged could be that in the years following the second world war, and before the period of national self-doubt that was provoked in 1956 by t<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2001/mar/14/past.education1\">he Suez crisis</a>, Britain engaged in so many end-of-empire scraps that military activity came to be regarded by the British public as the norm, and therefore unremarkable. Another is that since 1945, British forces have engaged in a series of small wars that were under-reported and now all but forgotten, or which were obscured, even as they were being fought, by more dramatic events elsewhere.</p> <p>A great deal is known about some conflicts, such as the 1982 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/apr/09/margaret-thatcher-falklands-gamble\">Falklands war</a> and the 2003 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jul/07/iraq-war-still-casts-a-long-shadow-over-a-dangerous-and-deeply-unstable-region\">invasion of Iraq</a>, and Britain\u2019s role in the two world wars has become in many ways central to the national narrative. But other conflicts are remembered only dimly or have always remained largely hidden.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p><strong>One strategically vital war,</strong> waged by Britain for more than a decade, was fought for most of that time in complete secrecy. In January 1972, readers of the Observer opened their newspaper to see a report headlined \u201cUK fighting secret Gulf war?\u201d On the same day, the Sunday Times ran a very similar article, asking: \u201cIs Dhofar Britain\u2019s hush-hush war?\u201d British troops, the newspapers revealed, were engaged in the war that the sultan of Oman was fighting against guerrillas in the mountains of Dhofar in the south of the country.</p> <p>Four years earlier, the devaluation crisis had forced Harold Wilson\u2019s government to pledge that British forces would be withdrawn from all points east of Suez by December 1971 \u2013 the only exemption being a small force that was to remain in Hong Kong. Now the Observer article was demanding to know: \u201cHas Britain really withdrawn all her forces from the Persian Gulf and the Arabian Peninsula? Or is the British government, like the Americans in Laos, waging a secret war without the full knowledge of parliament and public?\u201d The Observer located one of the insurgency\u2019s leaders, who told its reporter that the war had begun with an \u201cexplosion\u201d in the country on 9 June 1965, triggered by what he described as poor local governance and \u201cthe oppression of the British\u201d. By the time the Observer and Sunday Times were publishing their first, tentative reports, Britain had been at war in Oman for six-and-a-half years.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"0df21bd83d3730c47a68105a34953ef68ef98079\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0df21bd83d3730c47a68105a34953ef68ef98079/4_269_4973_2983/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Captain Charles Kendall, the British consul to the sultan of Oman, in 1969.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Captain Charles Kendall, the British consul to the sultan of Oman, in 1969.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tony Prime/ANL/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Situated on the south-west corner of the Arabian peninsula, the Sultanate of Oman is bordered by the United Arab Emirates to the north, and by Saudi Arabia and Yemen to the west and south-west. The country also sits alongside the Strait of Hormuz, the 33-mile wide waterway through which oil from the Persian Gulf makes its way to market. In the 1960s, more than 60% of the western world\u2019s crude oil came from the Gulf, a giant tanker passing through the Hormuz bottleneck every 10 minutes. As the oil flowed, local economies flourished and became important markets for exported British goods: London became even more anxious to protect its interests in the region and the local rulers who supported them.</p> <p>Throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, Britain maintained control of successive sultans of Oman to prevent any other colonial power gaining a foothold in the region. It achieved this through a simple means: money. In the mid-1960s, the country\u2019s tyrannical ruler, Sultan Said bin Taimur received more than half his income directly from London. Only from 1967, when Omani oil was pumped from the ground for the first time, did the country begin to generate most of its own income.</p> <p>Even then, Britain exercised enormous control over the sultan. His defence secretary and chief of intelligence were British army officers, his chief adviser was a former British diplomat, and all but one of his government ministers were British. The British commander of the Sultan of Oman\u2019s armed forces met daily with the British defence attache, and weekly with the British ambassador. The sultan had no formal relationship with any government other than that of the UK.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Officially, the Sultanate of Muscat and Oman was an independent state. In truth, it was a de facto British colony</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The official British position was that the Sultanate of Muscat and Oman was a fully sovereign and independent state. In truth, it was a de facto British colony. As such, successive British governments were responsible for the woeful political, social and economic conditions that the sultan\u2019s subjects endured, and which both created and fuelled the popular revolt.</p> <p>In the mid-1960s, Oman had one hospital. Its infant mortality rate was 75% and life expectancy was around 55 years. There were just three primary schools \u2013 which the sultan frequently threatened to close \u2013 and no secondary schools. The result of this was that just 5% of the population could read and write. There were no telephones or any other infrastructure, other than a series of ancient water channels. The sultan banned any object that he considered decadent, which meant that Omanis were prevented from possessing radios, from riding bicycles, from playing football, from wearing sunglasses, shoes or trousers, and from using electric pumps in their wells.</p> <p>Those who offended against the sultan\u2019s laws could expect savage punishment. There were public executions. Conditions in his prisons \u2013 where Pakistani guards received their orders from British warders \u2013 were said to be horrendous, with large numbers of inmates shackled together in darkened cells, without proper food or medical attention.</p> <p>The people of Oman despised and feared both their sultan and the British who kept him in place and colluded with his policy of non-development. Unsurprisingly, the sultan often had to call upon the British to provide the military force required to protect him from his own people.</p> <p>During the 1950s there were a number of uprisings in the north of the country, which were put down by British forces. Both the SAS and the RAF were critical to the success of these counter-insurgency operations. Between July and December 1958, for example, the RAF flew 1,635 sorties, dropping 1,094 tons of bombs and firing 900 rockets at the insurgents, their mountain-top villages and irrigation works. This was more than twice the weight of bombs that the Luftwaffe dropped on Coventry in November 1940.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"7024797972629edc73b52e09232f7e5bb4c7192b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7024797972629edc73b52e09232f7e5bb4c7192b/0_327_8458_5518/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The SAS on patrol in Oman in 1961.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"652\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The SAS on patrol in Oman in 1961.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Topfoto</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>* * *</h2> <p><strong>In 1966, a new rebellion broke out</strong> in the south of the country, among the people of Dhofar province. The following year, after surviving an assassination attempt, the sultan and his Dhofari wife retired to his palace on the coast at Salalah. He was so rarely sighted that many of his subjects became convinced that he must have died, and that the British were concealing that from them.</p> <p>For the new Labour government, the close relationship with the client sultanate presented an ideological problem. The Labour party had been elected in 1964 on a manifesto that included a pledge to wage a new \u201cwar on want\u201d in the developing world, and to fight for \u201cfreedom and racial equality\u201d at the United Nations general assembly. It would cause the most excruciating humiliation were it to become known more widely, at home and abroad, that Oman was the last country on earth where slavery remained legal. The sultan owned around 500 slaves. An estimated 150 of them were women, whom he kept at his palace at Salalah; a number of his male slaves were said to have been physically deformed by the cruelties they had suffered.</p> <p>After the rebellions of the 1950s, the Sultan of Oman\u2019s armed forces were reorganised, with British advice, training, equipment and funds. More Omanis were recruited into the ranks, but all of the officers were British. Some were \u201cseconded officers\u201d while others were so-called contract officers, or mercenaries \u2013 men who had previously served in Oman with the British Army and who had chosen to return to earn handsome rewards.</p> <p>Initially, the rebels they faced in Dhofar were Arab nationalists. However, to the west of Dhofar lay Aden, from which the British were forced to withdraw at the end of 1967, in the face of increasingly violent rebellions. British rule had been replaced by a Marxist state, the People\u2019s Democratic Republic of Yemen, which received aid from both China and Russia. By early 1968, a Dhofari nationalist insurgency was developing into a Chinese-backed revolutionary movement with pan-Arabian ambitions. To the British officers, however, the foe was always simply the <em>adoo</em> \u2013 Arabic for enemy. By the end of 1969, the <em>adoo</em> had captured the coastal town of Raysut, and by early the following year they controlled most of the high plains and were within mortaring distance of the RAF base at Salalah.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Any enemy corpses we recovered were propped up in the souk as a salutary lesson to would-be freedom fighters</p> <footer> <cite>Anonymous British officer</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The new oil fields on the desert between Dhofar and the capital, Muscat, were beginning to look vulnerable. Some in London were developing a fearful Middle Eastern domino theory, in which they envisaged the Strait of Hormuz falling under communist control.</p> <p>The British response was merciless. \u201cWe burnt down rebel villages and shot their goats and cows,\u201d one officer wrote. \u201cAny enemy corpses we recovered were propped up in the Salalah souk as a salutary lesson to any would-be freedom fighters.\u201d Another officer explained that unlike in Northern Ireland, where soldiers were anxious to avoid killing or wounding non-combatants, he believed that in Dhofar there were no innocents, only <em>adoo</em>: \u201cThe only people in this area \u2013 there are no civilians \u2013 are all enemy. Therefore you can get on with doing the job, mortaring the area and returning small arms fire without worrying about hurting innocent people.\u201d</p> <p>In their determination to put down a popular rebellion against the cruelty and neglect of a despot who was propped up and financed by Britain, British-led forces poisoned wells, torched villages, destroyed crops and shot livestock. During the interrogation of rebels they developed their torture techniques, experimenting with noise. Areas populated by civilians were turned into free-fire zones. Little wonder that Britain wanted to fight this war in total secrecy.</p> <p>There was no need to resort to the Official Secrets Acts or the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/jul/31/d-notice-system-state-media-press-freedom\">D-notice system</a> in order to conceal the Dhofar war, and the ruthless manner in which it was being fought, from the outside world. Two simple expedients were employed: no journalists were permitted into the country, and nobody in government mentioned the war. When Wilson published his account of the Labour government of 1964-70, for example, he mentioned the war that the US was fighting in Vietnam almost 250 times. His own government\u2019s war in Oman was not mentioned once.</p> <p>While the Wilson government had every reason to be sensitive about the military support it was providing to a slave-owning despot, whose rule might charitably be described as medieval, there were additional reasons for the all-embracing secrecy. This was an era in which the developing world and the United Nations had rejected colonialism, and Arab nationalism had been growing in strength for decades. It was vital, therefore, for the credibility of the UK in the Middle East, that its hand in Oman should remain largely hidden.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"2bc9fb93dbcaddf24ec0e05f7a6d05435295f033\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2bc9fb93dbcaddf24ec0e05f7a6d05435295f033/0_314_5168_3101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Omani rebels, called the adoo by the British, in 1971.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Omani rebels, called the <em>adoo</em> by the British, in 1971.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Keystone-France/Gamma-Keystone via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>John Akehurst, the commander of the Sultan\u2019s Armed Forces from 1972, suggests a further reason for the British government not wishing to draw attention to its war in Dhofar: \u201cThey were perhaps nervous that we were going to lose it.\u201d</p> <p>Certainly, by the summer of 1970, Britain\u2019s secret war was going so badly that desperate measures were called for.</p> <p>On 26 July, the Foreign Office in London announced that Sultan Said bin Taimur had been deposed by his 29-year-old son, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/mar/04/oman-sultan-qaboos-despot\">Qaboos bin Said</a>, in a palace coup. In fact, the coup was a very British affair. It had been planned in London by MI6 and by civil servants at the Ministry of Defence and the Foreign Office, and given the go-ahead after the election that brought Edward Heath into Downing Street.</p> <p>The new sultan immediately abolished slavery, improved the country\u2019s irrigation infrastructure and began to spend his oil revenues on his armed forces. Troops from the SAS arrived, first as the sultan\u2019s bodyguards, and then in squadron strength to fight the <em>adoo</em>. Eventually, the tide turned, journalists were permitted into the country, and by the summer of 1976 the war was won.</p> <p>Strategically, the Dhofar war was one of the most important conflicts of the 20th century, as the victors could expect to control the Strait of Hormuz and the flow of oil. Thousands died, the British won and the west\u2019s lights stayed on. Today, the war is still studied at the Joint Services Command and Staff College in Britain. But because of the way in which information about the long campaign was so successfully suppressed at the time that it was being waged, it has been all but blanked out of the nation\u2019s memory. Like the British wars in Eritrea, Indochina, the Dutch East Indies and Borneo, it is remembered in Britain only by those men who fought it, and their families.</p> <p>Some aspects of Britain\u2019s role in the coup and the war remain among the deep secrets of the British state. Wilson\u2019s correspondence on Oman, for example, and that of his successor Heath, are to remain closed to historians and the public until 2021. In 2005, a Foreign Office memo was briefly made public that describes the way in which the old sultan\u2019s own defence secretary, Colonel Hugh Oldman, had taken the lead role in planning the coup that deposed Oman\u2019s ruler, in order to safeguard British access to the country\u2019s oil and military bases. The document was then hurriedly withdrawn \u2013 its release, the Foreign Office said, had been an unfortunate error.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"8e9b80c60462b066c7feec98c511a98f3897348d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8e9b80c60462b066c7feec98c511a98f3897348d/0_0_4950_2971/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Qaboos bin Said took over from his father in 1970 in a palace coup orchestrated by Britain.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Qaboos bin Said took over from his father in 1970 in a palace coup orchestrated by Britain.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Keystone/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>* * *</h2> <p><strong>Judging from the last decade and a half,</strong> there is little sign that the British state is about to lose its appetite for war. The first conflict of the new century in which the UK became involved was the post-9/11 assault against the Taliban regime in Afghanistan.</p> <p>This war enjoyed early success, but stuttered and soured after the UK\u2019s mission expanded to Helmand in the south of the country. The war dragged on, costing an estimated 95,000 lives over 13 years, including those of 453 British servicemen and women, and brought little discernible benefit to the people of Afghanistan. The 21st century\u2019s second war \u2013 the 2003 invasion of Iraq \u2013 was possibly the UK\u2019s greatest foreign policy disaster since Suez. Casualty estimates vary widely, from 150,000 dead to more than a million. What cannot be disputed is that 179 of the dead were British. More than a decade later, Iraq remains in chaos.</p> <p>The post-9/11 conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq were fought in the full glare of the media and came to haunt the politicians who had initiated them. Despite this, Britain continued to invest in war \u2013 politically, technically and financially \u2013 as a means of projecting power and securing influence among key allies, and also, it seemed at times, in an attempt to impose order and a degree of familiarity upon a chaotic and unpredictable world.</p> <p>But could this be done in secret? Surely, in the age of global media, 24-hour rolling news, social media, and the troops\u2019 own ability to record and instantly share images of conflict, it would be impossible for a British government to go to war and conceal its actions, in the way that Britain\u2019s war in Dhofar was hidden from the public for six-and-a-half years? Tony Jeapes, who commanded the first SAS squadron that was covertly deployed to Oman, considered this question, and concluded that while such secrecy was \u201can ideal state of affairs\u201d, it would probably be impossible to repeat.</p> <p>In the years since the Dhofar war, the UK\u2019s special forces have been gradually expanded, and since 1996, all its members have been obliged to sign a confidentiality agreement. This has reinforced the discretion with which members of elite units within the military traditionally perform their duties, and it has rarely been broken.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the evolution of successive generations of unmanned aerial vehicles, or drones, has presented military planners with greater opportunities to mount operations that could remain unknown, other than to those who are ordering, planning and executing them, and to those on the receiving end.</p> <p>The reliance of modern societies on the internet and the increasing frequency with which states probe and attack each other\u2019s cyber defences have led some analysts to talk of a hybrid warfare, much of which is shrouded in deniability. The result is that the line between war and peace is increasingly blurred.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"1fa912515c2a6b068ae7e1abbb815bc42926c1fc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1fa912515c2a6b068ae7e1abbb815bc42926c1fc/0_176_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An RAF Reaper.

It appeared that a lethal trinity of special forces, drones and local proxies was being brought to bear in a way that would spare the British public the disagreeable details of the nature of modern war, and relieve parliament of the need to debate the wisdom of waging it.</p> <p>In July 2007, less than a week after succeeding Tony Blair as prime minister, Gordon Brown had announced a series of sweeping constitutional changes that he said would make the British government \u201ca better servant of the people\u201d. One measure \u2013 clearly a response to the deeply unpopular war in Iraq and the calamitous and costly expedition into Helmand \u2013 was to give members of parliament the final say on declarations of war.</p> <p>Six years later, in August 2013, parliament exercised its new right when MPs rejected a government motion that would have authorised military intervention in Syria\u2019s bloody civil war.</p> <p>Ministers of the coalition government were appalled by the vote \u2013 it was said to be the first against a British prime minister\u2019s foreign policy since 1782 \u2013 and argued that it not only blocked the deployment of British troops, it also prevented the UK from providing any military assistance whatsoever.</p> <p>\u201cIt is clear to me,\u201d Prime Minister David Cameron told the Commons, \u201cthat the British parliament, reflecting the views of the British people, does not want to see British military action. I get that and the government will act accordingly.\u201d</p> <p>But those words \u2013 \u201cact accordingly\u201d \u2013 were not quite what they seemed.</p> <p>In July 2015, the defence secretary, Michael Fallon, gave MPs an update on the renewed military operations in Iraq \u2013 the campaign that Cameron had announced while standing before two union jack flags and declaring the British to be \u201ca peaceful people\u201d. The RAF, he said, had carried out 300 air strikes in Iraq, there were 900 UK personnel engaged, and the operation had cost \u00a345m in the previous 12 months. He reassured his audience that \u201cour position remains that we would return to the House for approval before conducting air strikes in Syria\u201d.</p> <p>Before making this statement, Fallon was said to have been unsettled by talk in Washington political circles that the UK\u2019s refusal to act in Syria could be seen only as a sign of British decrepitude. His statement was deeply misleading: for at least 18 months, RAF pilots who were said to have been \u201cembedded\u201d with the US and Canadian military had been carrying out airstrikes against targets in Syria. Others had been flying combat missions with the French military over Mali. They were said to be under the command of these foreign forces, but they were clearly a British contribution to a war that MPs had decided the country should avoid.</p> <p>Two weeks later the truth was out, and Fallon was back on his feet in the Commons, explaining himself to angry MPs.</p> <p>\u201cEmbedded\u201d service personnel were nothing new, he declared; they comply with UK law, but \u201chave to comply with the rules of engagement of the host nation\u201d. He had not publicised what had been happening because these pilots had been assisting with other countries\u2019 operations. Moreover, he made clear that the failure to publicise what was happening should be regarded as \u201cstandard practice\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/jul/17/british-pilots-took-part-in-anti-isis-bombing-campaign-in-syria\">British pilots took part in anti-Isis bombing campaign in Syria</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In December 2015, MPs voted that overt military action against Islamic State forces should finally proceed.

The British were helping their Saudi counterparts key in the codes that would help them select and attack their targets. The Saudis were not only flying British-built aircraft and dropping British-made bombs, they were dropping vast numbers of them. Over a three-month period in 2015, the value of exports of British-made bombs and missiles had increased by 11,000%, from \u00a39m to \u00a31bn.</p> <p>This bombing campaign has been heavily criticised by rights groups for causing thousands of civilian deaths.

  "<p>A time-travelling Tudor peasant might return to the place of their birth and find reassurance in the sight of Madingley\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.madingleychurch.org/history/\">medieval church</a>. They could stand before its sturdy tower and run their fingers over stones embedded in mortar, as I did, then step inside to rediscover the font where they were baptised, and look up for re-acquaintance with exquisitely detailed medieval figures floating in stained glass. </p> <p>But a hard stare into the nettled field beside the churchyard would make them wonder where their village had gone. The 18th century owners of Madingley Hall, which is about four miles from the centre of Cambridge, desired an estate with a view, and that view did not include a village street. So by the middle of the century the people had been evicted from their homes, their houses razed to the ground. I came to search for evidence of this lost community and found it.</p> <p>An archaeologist\u2019s eye would see signs of this lowland clearance in a dried stream that was never wet. The sunken channel running through the adjacent meadow was not a stream at all, but the course of West Street, a sinuous route leading parishioners almost to the church door. But the road, the buildings and their foundations were lost, replaced by thick ryegrass and nettles.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"075c5f0ac5cc1bec18a50ce50d2a2443b9d7fbd3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/075c5f0ac5cc1bec18a50ce50d2a2443b9d7fbd3/0_0_2000_1333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Madingley church\u2019s early Tudor stained glass\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Early Tudor stained glass in Madingley church, showing, left, a figure representing charity and justice, and, right, Charlemagne.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sarah Niemann</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Outside the churchyard, however, rabbits had unearthed what I thought was a village midden. An arc of yew trees enclosed the old graveyard and the animals had burrowed into a bank, throwing up spoil from under the yew roots \u2013 broken pieces of tile, an oyster shell and what I assumed were domestic animal bones.</p> <p>In early spring I took away a single small bone, but, before I could store it with my rabbit and badger skulls, mink jawbone and other assorted animal parts, I began to have doubts. </p> <p>My radiographer mother-in-law confirmed them; it was the knuckle of a human thumb. And now, as I stood again in the place where I had found it, I thought about the person who had died and those who had laid that person\u2019s body in the ground. I reached into my pocket, drew out the thumb bone and put it back where it belonged.</p> <p><em>Follow Country diary on Twitter: </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/GdnCountryDiary\">@gdncountrydiary</a></p> <p><em>Derek Niemann is teaching a course in creative nature writing at the University of Cambridge Institute of Continuing Education, Madingley Hall, on 17 September (<a href=\"https://www.ice.cam.ac.uk/component/courses/?view=course&amp;cid=20452Madingley,%20Cambridge\">ice.cam.ac.uk</a>)</em></p>",

He <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/kyleblaine/donald-trump-lies-that-he-opposed-iraq-war-from-beginning-an?utm_term=.wt2E7Y2rwP\">lied about opposing the Iraq war</a>, criticized Obama\u2019s 2011 withdrawal and repeated his advocacy of stealing Iraq\u2019s oil \u2013 a measure he evidently believes would require a minimal force presence, despite the certainty that the well-armed locals might have a problem with their principal source of wealth being plundered by a foreign power.</p> <p>Speaking before an audience of veterans, Trump unexpectedly attacked the current generation of generals and flag officers. While previously Trump had said he <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/11/13/the-remarkably-unappealling-anger-of-donald-trump/\">knew better than the generals</a> about fighting Islamic State, this time he intimated that he\u2019d get \u201cdifferent generals\u201d \u2013 a habit more typical of caudillos than American presidents.</p> <p>He followed up by saying his ultimate plan to defeat Isis would be some parts of his still-unspecified plan, and some parts of his unspecified generals\u2019 unspecified plan. He waved away his lack of specifics for a war in which 5,000 US troops are currently serving as not wishing to \u201cbroadcast\u201d his plans to the enemy.</p> <p>He interrupted a veteran\u2019s question about veterans\u2019 suicide rates after she gave the correct number, <a href=\"http://www.militarytimes.com/story/veterans/2016/07/07/va-suicide-20-daily-research/86788332/\">20 per day</a>, so he could give an incorrect one, 22. Trump fumbled through a question about redressing sexual assault against female service members \u2013 something he once tweeted was the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/331907383771148288\">inevitable result of mixed service</a>, a point he defended on Wednesday \u2013 by arguing the military needed to set up internal courts, as if the military does not already have its own well-established justice system.<br></p> <p>Trump\u2019s reversion to his typical ignorance and certitude obscured a poor showing from his opponent. Hillary Clinton spent her preceding half-hour grilling defending herself on her lax handling of classified information, a situation that a former Navy lieutenant in the audience correctly observed would spell doom for a low-ranking service member.</p> <p>She acknowledged her vote for the Iraq war was a \u201cmistake\u201d and gestured in the direction of the same for her advocacy of the 2011 Libya war, but waved it away by pointing out Trump\u2019s support for the same disastrous interventions, a baffling decision for a candidate whose central pitch is that Trump is uniquely unqualified to be president.</p> <p>To reassure a progressive veteran in the audience Clinton offered that she would treat the use of force as a \u201clast resort\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWe are not putting ground troops into Iraq ever again,\u201d Clinton said, as if there were not this minute thousands of them there.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57d0d178e4b042bbfb3246c8\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-08T02:53:24.444Z\">3.53am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Colin Powell's advice to Clinton on using personal email</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Although it didn\u2019t directly come up in the forum on Wednesday evening, this is intriguing reading: a 2009 email exchange between Hillary Clinton and former secretary of state Colin Powell in which she asks for \u2013 and he gives \u2013 advice on using her Blackberry in the state department.</p> <p>The full exchange is <a href=\"https://medium.com/oversightdems/cummings-releases-full-powell-email-advising-clinton-on-personal-email-use-65904c1ccfa#.lo7sv941t\">here</a>, released by Deomcratic Rep. Elijah Cummings via the House oversight committee, but here\u2019s a snippet of Powell\u2019s email:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> I didn\u2019t have a BlackBerry. What I did do was have a personal computer that was hooked up to a private phone line (sounds ancient.) So I could communicate with a wide range of friends directly without it going through the State Department servers. I even used it to do business with some foreign leaders and some of the senior folks in the Department on their personal email accounts. I did the same thing on the road in hotels.</p> <p>Now, the real issue had to do with PDAs, as we called them a few years ago before BlackBerry became a noun. And the issue was DS would not allow them into the secure spaces, especially up your way. When I asked why not they gave me all kinds of nonsense about how they gave out signals and could be read by spies, etc. Same reason they tried to keep mobile phones out of the suite. I had numerous meetings with them. We even opened one up for them to try to explain to me why it was more dangerous than say, a remote control for one of the many tvs in the suite. Or something embedded in my shoe heel. They never satisfied me and NSA/CIA wouldn\u2019t back off. So, we just went about our business and stopped asking. I had an ancient version of a PDA and used it. In general, the suite was so sealed that it is hard to get signals in or out wirelessly.</p> <p>However, there is a real danger. If it is public that you have a BlackBerry and it it government and you are using it, government or not, to do business, it may become an official record and subject to the law. Reading about the President\u2019s BB rules this morning, it sounds like it won\u2019t be as useful as it used to be. Be very careful. I got around it all by not saying much and not using systems that captured the data.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57d0ceace4b042bbfb3246be\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-08T02:42:22.336Z\">3.42am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>For those now wondering when we can watch the two candidates go head to head \u2013 on the same stage, at the same time, presumably answering something like the same questions \u2013 here\u2019s the schedule:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Monday 26 September, </strong>Hofstra University, Hempstead, NY.

Liberals would find much to dispute, but a dispute could proceed on the merits of Romney\u2019s national security perspective weighed against Obama\u2019s. </p> <p>No one could ever accuse Donald Trump of being Mitt Romney. </p> <p>Before boarding the aircraft carrier turned museum USS Intrepid, Trump gave a speech on Wednesday gesturing in the direction of Republican national security orthodoxies. The army\u2019s active-duty force levels, known as \u201cend strength\u201d, ought to return to 540,000 soldiers, where they were earlier in the decade, reversing a trajectory heading <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.armytimes.com/story/military/careers/army/2016/05/07/army-shrinks-smallest-level-since-before-world-war-ii/83875962/\">down to 450,000 by 2018</a>. The navy ought to have a fleet sized at 350 ships, beyond its <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://news.usni.org/2016/07/12/20627\">current planning for a 308-ship fleet</a> after 2020. </p> <p>Along with an expansion of combat aircraft and missile defenses, and repealing a budget cap on defense spending known as the sequester, Trump\u2019s enthusiasm for purchasing more military hardware would not sound out of place coming from a typical Republican on the congressional armed services committees. Superficially at least Romney might not have disagreed, either. That was likely the point: to reassure voters Trump possesses a baseline level of familiarity with the basics of military responsibility. </p> <p>By the evening, however, at NBC News\u2019 touted \u201cCommander-in-Chief Forum\u201d, Trump ordered off his familiar campaign menu of word salads. He <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/kyleblaine/donald-trump-lies-that-he-opposed-iraq-war-from-beginning-an?utm_term=.wt2E7Y2rwP\">lied about opposing the Iraq war</a>, criticized Obama\u2019s 2011 withdrawal and repeated his now-boilerplate advocacy of stealing Iraq\u2019s oil \u2013 a measure that he evidently believes would require a minimal force presence, despite the certainty that the well-armed locals might have a problem with their principal source of wealth being plundered by a foreign power. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"703937ccd93adfb357da71693e0a38a4f045cc80\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/703937ccd93adfb357da71693e0a38a4f045cc80/0_0_4257_2554/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Donald Trump waits to be introduced at the Commander in Chief Forum.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Donald Trump waits to be introduced at the forum on Wednesday night.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Evan Vucci/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Speaking before an audience of veterans, Trump unexpectedly attacked the current generation of generals and flag officers. The current senior officer corps has been \u201creduced to rubble\u201d, Trump said, and were \u201cembarrassing for our country\u201d. While previously Trump had said he <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/11/13/the-remarkably-unappealling-anger-of-donald-trump/\">knew better than the generals</a> about fighting Islamic State, this time he intimated that he\u2019d get \u201cdifferent generals\u201d \u2013 a habit more typical of caudillos than American presidents.</p> <p>He followed up by saying his ultimate plan to defeat Isis would consist of some parts of his still-unspecified plan and some parts of his unspecified generals\u2019 unspecified plan. He waved away his lack of specifics on a war in which 5,000 US troops are currently serving as not wishing to \u201cbroadcast\u201d his plans to the enemy. </p> <p>Trump again lavished praise on Vladimir Putin, pledging a new era of US-Russian cooperation \u2013 something both Obama and George Bush attempted and failed to achieve after US and Russian interests diverged. Despite months of the Russian military\u2019s demonstrating in Syria that Putin\u2019s objective is to suppress Bashar al-Assad\u2019s domestic resistance, Trump claimed that Russia wished to defeat Isis \u201cas badly as we do\u201d. Putin might be a dictator \u2013 Trump waved away moderator Matt Lauer on this point \u2013 but he had \u201cvery strong control\u201d, he said.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/sep/08/donald-trump-putin-more-of-a-leader-of-his-country-than-obama-for-us-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/525fa\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2700631\"            data-video-name=\"Donald Trump: Putin is far more of a leader of his country than Obama is for US \u2013\u00a0video\"            data-video-provider=\"NBC News\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57d10cdae4b0c1d95ae14821\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/09/08/160907Trump4putin_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/09/08/160907Trump4putin.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/09/08/160907Trump4putin_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/sep/08/donald-trump-putin-more-of-a-leader-of-his-country-than-obama-for-us-video\">\u2018Putin is more of a leader of his country than Obama is for US\u2019</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Nor did Trump demonstrate greater mastery of urgent issues of US service members\u2019 health and safety. He interrupted a veteran\u2019s question about veterans\u2019 suicide rates after she gave the correct number, <a href=\"http://www.militarytimes.com/story/veterans/2016/07/07/va-suicide-20-daily-research/86788332/\">20 per day</a>, so he could give an incorrect one, 22. Trump fumbled through a question about redressing sexual assault against women service personnel \u2013 something he once tweeted was the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/331907383771148288\">inevitable result of mixed-gender service</a>, a point he defended on Wednesday. </p> <p>Trump\u2019s reversion to his typical ignorance and certitude obscured a poor showing from his opponent, the Democratic nominee, Hillary Clinton. Clinton spent her preceding half-hour grilling on the Intrepid defending herself on her lax handling of classified information, a situation that a former navy lieutenant in the audience correctly observed would spell doom for a low-ranking service member. She acknowledged her vote for the Iraq war was a \u201cmistake\u201d and gestured in the direction of the same for her advocacy of the 2011 Libya war, but waved this away by pointing out Trump\u2019s support for the same disastrous interventions \u2013 a baffling decision for a candidate whose central pitch is that Trump is uniquely unqualified to be president. </p> <p>To reassure a progressive veteran in the audience, Clinton offered that she would treat the use of force as a \u201clast resort\u201d. Every presidential aspirant issues that boilerplate \u2013 as it elides an explanation of what the candidate thinks is worth fighting for \u2013 but Clinton\u2019s long public record, which she uses as a selling point against Trump, gives reason to doubt it. \u201cWe are not putting ground troops into Iraq ever again,\u201d Clinton said, as if there were not thousands of them already there.</p> <p>Clinton\u2019s gestures in hawkish directions are at least predictable. Trump is something wilder, less disciplined and far less grounded. Asked about his fitness for diplomacy, Trump boasted of his disastrous meeting in Mexico last week with Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto, in which the Mexican president <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/31/donald-trump-mexico-meeting-president-pena-nieto-immigration\">publicly contradicted Trump\u2019s claim</a> that the two did not discuss payment for Trump\u2019s proposed border wall, and which left Pe\u00f1a Nieto <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/01/enrique-pena-nieto-donald-trump-public-relations-disaster\">diminished at home</a>.</p> <p>For all the derision Romney endured in his presidential bid, at least he never engineered a lose-lose diplomatic summit.</p>",

After six years of often being the sole woman in the room, she had expected less than a dozen.</p> <p>Some of the women who come to her events are already in the industry and are looking to make connections and improve their skills; others are dipping their toe into the world of coding to see if it suits them.</p> <p>Watson says young women and girls are turned off tech careers when they compare their skills to those of the males around them. Boys often learn to code through gaming and playing around with computers and robotics.</p> <p>\u201cWhen you have never even tried coding and you don\u2019t know if you would be good at it and you walk into a classroom where most of the people in that class are doing that degree because they are good at it, they\u2019ve been doing it since age 10, that can be intimidating and [could] put girls off computer science.\u201d</p> <p>Watson started her computer science degree with only some high school classes in Excel to prepare her. \u201cI was one of three girls in a classroom of 80 and everyone else seemed to know the curriculum already. It was hard to put your hand up and ask silly questions,\u201d she recalls.</p> <p>Watson\u2019s turning point came when her studies moved on to interactive systems which describe how humans use computers.

Having a creative, diverse background gave me an edge over the other people in my class and I fell in love with it. I cannot believe it was almost an accident.\u201d</p> <p>Sandy Plunkett, the founder of the consultancy Innovation Clearinghouse, says one of the easiest ways to get girls into Stem (science, technology, engineering and maths) is through the liberal arts.<br></p> <p>\u201cBy getting them into music and art and drama and languages, they are learning another language. If they can read music, the chances are that they will be less intimidated by code,\u201d Plunkett says.</p> <p>The \u201cbrogramming\u201d culture of the male-dominated industry also needs to change because women find it unappealing. </p> <p>Watson says while people often say learning programming is hard, it is no harder than learning to play an instrument.</p> <p>\u201cWhen you start playing, you won\u2019t be very good and you won\u2019t be able to build apps and websites straight away and so a lot of people are deterred by that. But form a band, find other coders who are like you and code together and create a study group. You practise together and it is fun and it is sociable.\u201d</p> <p>It is not necessary to go to university to become a coder, says Watson. Some people in the industry are self-taught, others have done online courses and she has heard of people who have completed 16-week courses and walked straight into a good job.</p> <p>Women also need to see the real-world applications of programming, to find things they are passionate about and then use programming as a way to make things happen, she says.</p> <p>\u201cCuriosity is first. Being curious about the world around you. Curiosity about health or medicine or art or space will get you there. You will have to, at some stage, see the impact of technology on that.\u201d</p>",

Williams sends another forehand well past the baseline and Halep escapes with the hold. </p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-09-08T01:42:26.309Z\">at 2.42am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57d0ba72e4b042bbfb324679\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-08T01:10:14.733Z\">2.10am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Third set: Williams 6-2, 4-6, 1-0 Halep* (*denotes next server)</strong></p> <p>Sluggish start to the decider by Williams.

Forehand winner by Williams and Halep feeling pressure at 15-30. Halep levels it at 30-all but commits an unforced error to give Williams a break point for 5-all. A fault and Williams creeps up past the baseline in anticipation of Halep\u2019s second serve. And now Williams nets a return on Halep\u2019s second serve! Deuce. Williams sprays a forehand \u2013 and challenges it unsuccessfully \u2013 to give Halep a second set point but Williams saves it. Deuce again. Now another error by Halep gives Williams a second break-point chance, but Halep saves it with a forehand winner. Deuce No3. Halep has now saved all nine break points she\u2019s faced. Another unforced error by Williams gives Halep a third set point, but Williams hits a forehand volley winner to return it to deuce once again. Forced error from the forehand side by Halep gives Williams another break-point opportunity, but another unforced error by Williams returns it to deuce for a fifth time. Epic game, this. A Williams error gives Halep a third set point in this game (and fourth overall) but Williams drives a forehand winner to snuff it out. Another forehand winner by Williams sets up break point but Halep saves it again! Williams now 0-for-11 on break points. Forehand winner by Williams sets up the fifth break point of this game, but Halep\u2019s forehand winner erases it \u2013 again! \u2013 to bring it back to deuce. A fist pump by Halep! Another mistake of aggression by Williams gives Halep a set point and this time Williams sends a backhand long to give Halep the second set after a marathon 22-point game.

  "<p>\u201cFabric\u201d is the preferred metaphor when exploring deep controversy in rugby league. There are typically three things you can do to it: threaten it, tear it, or destroy it. These are the rules. So what does Wednesday\u2019s news of a NSW police investigation into allegations of \u201ccheating at gambling and match fixing\u201d do to the game\u2019s fabric?<br></p> <p>Sadly, it\u2019s not clear-cut. But whereas cheating seems more rampant in global sport than ever, shade over rugby league is nothing new. And while the actual details of league\u2019s shadiness aren\u2019t ever common; the perception of shadiness, which matters most, is.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/07/nsw-police-launch-investigation-into-alleged-nrl-match-fixing\">NSW Police launch investigation into alleged NRL match fixing</a> </p> </aside>  <p>How deep a shade do the allegations cast on Richard Ings\u2019 then-ridiculed \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/feb/07/australian-doping-sport-drugs\">blackest day in Australian sport</a>\u201d line in 2013? Looking back, Ings\u2019 illustration was in response to evidence that personal relationships between professional athletes and organised criminal identities might \u201chave resulted in match fixing and the fraudulent manipulation of betting markets\u201d.</p> <p>In the quest to win the battle of perception, perhaps it doesn\u2019t matter. Such a brutal job was done on mocking the drama of that moment that mere mention of \u201cblackest days\u201d might simply incite a shudder and nothing more. People cope in their own way.</p> <p>In a recent radio interview, CEO Todd Greenberg said that when it came to rugby league, he was conscious \u201cnot to take the \u2018soap\u2019 out of the soap opera\u201d. A grabby media line, sure, but an instructive one too. Since Donny Lane defied residential rules and played for Glebe, not Annandale, in 1917, shadiness has forever been part of the game.</p> <p>League fans have developed the resilience to embrace it and own it, too. Humour helps.</p> <p>Early in the Wests Tigers game on Sunday, a solitary roar emerged from somewhere near the grandstand. The home team, trying to keep their season alive, had conceded another debatable penalty \u2013 laying on the ball too long. \u201cWe get it ref! Jarryd Hayne must play semi-finals!\u201d came the raspy, conspiratory cry, followed by laughter at the notionally absurd joke.</p> <p>League-types, with backs to the wall, stick together. Witness one of the game\u2019s wisest, funniest and senior elder statesmen, Roy Masters, commencing an analysis of the match-fixing allegations on ABCs Melbourne-based TV program, Offsiders, after they emerged in June. The man who first coined the term Fibros and Silvertails was sitting alongside an all-Melburnian panel of Gerard Whateley, Caroline Wilson and Waleed Aly. On the allegations, he submitted that \u201cwhat it all boils down to is this: people want it to be true, because it adds to the salacious gossip, rumour and innuendo surrounding sport, particularly at this chilly time of the year\u201d.</p> <p>In one way, the construction of rugby league as the sporting embodiment of Who Weekly works in its favour. Fans are conditioned to the tawdry vulgarity of league\u2019s weekly drama; it\u2019s part of the show. Sydney, where these latest acts of alleged sin are set, has forever been its moral home. </p> <p>Speaking at the Tom Brock Annual Lecture in 2001, the late playwright and league devotee Alex Buzo described 19<sup>th</sup> century Sydney as a \u201craffish capital with rather too much in the way of violence and corruption\u2026looked at rather askance by the rest of the country\u2026its dominant sport called \u2018Thugby League\u2019\u201d. In 2016, despite some well-intentioned attempts at polish, the game still retains that identity \u2013 its devotees revel in its earthiness; and outsiders are rarely envious.</p> <p>So when match-fixing allegations emerge, the league public can be forgiven for thinking they\u2019ve heard things like this before. In the spirit of scandal, there will be intimate interest in the sordid detail, no doubt, but not for them the confected and puritanical shock and horror that fans of other sports may habour. </p> <p>It remains to be seen just how large the appetite is for yet another sermon \u2013 another navel-gazing exercise \u2013 on the insidious links between gambling money and the game itself. The same money that rugby league elder statesman Phil Gould, in response to the Gillard government\u2019s proposed poker machine legislation in 2011, said would \u201cdestroy your club, and the game of rugby league at all levels in the Sydney metropolitan area\u201d. That sermon will come, but is the cognitive dissonance too strong?</p> <p>And as news of the police investigation emerged on Wednesday, administrators and custodians were quick to advise to be careful what you say; that these things are difficult to prove; and you don\u2019t want to cast blanket aspersions on the innocent. The reaction amongst the league rank and file to the news was typically muted. It was not out of shock. They haven\u2019t actually been here before, but it feels like they have.</p> <p>The game\u2019s fabric may be damaged, but as with scars, some people just prefer it that way. </p>",
